is when the universe forgets its makeup
and walks around in its bare skull.

The house is a quiet mouth,
breathing through the fridge motor,
each click of the compressor
a tiny mechanical rosary
counting how long you’ve been awake.

Streetlight leaks through the blinds—
thin gold bars on the carpet,
like you’re sleeping at the bottom
of a glowing prison.

Your phone is a black pond
where no stone ever lands:
no rings, no buzz, just
your own reflection
waiting to become someone else.

Out there, monsters live in forests,
in headlines, in people’s mistakes.
They wear uniforms and bad cologne,
nameplates and job titles,
write memos and histories
and call it “order.”

In here, at 2:34 a.m.,
monsters have smaller costumes:
they are the questions that sound like facts—
no one cares,
you blew it,
this is who you’ll always be.

You lie there on your too-familiar mattress,
half prayer, half threat,
a little constellation of old coffee stains
glowing on the nightstand.

Your thoughts do what thoughts do:
build staircases to nowhere,
replay arguments in higher definition
than they ever had in real life,
cutting and splicing the film
until the villain always looks like you.

Somewhere between one heartbeat
and the next
you remember:

> Be wary, you who battle monsters,
for every enemy is also a mirror
you’re afraid to look into.



You realize there’s no clean border
between “them” and “you” tonight—
just a thin chalk line of choice
you can still step away from
before it rains.

The old books would call this “shadow”:
your unchosen self,
draft version of you
who believes every cruel possibility
without editing a single line.

And you know the simpler truth:
if you stare too long
at what broke you,
you start practicing the shape
of the breaking.

So you do something small,
almost embarrassingly small:
you refuse to nod along.

You take one slow breath
like you’re signing your name
under a different story:
I am here.
I am unfinished.
This hour is a visitor,
not a verdict.

The fridge hums its tired sermon.
A car passes outside,
headlights sliding across the wall
like a brief visitation from another timeline
where you already slept,
where the monsters got bored
and left you alone.

You think about how every monster
you’ve ever faced—
the loud ones, the subtle ones,
the ones with fists
and the ones with silence—
worked from the same blueprint:
convince you that your softness
is proof you deserve to be hurt.

But tonight, at 2:34 a.m.,
you hold a small rebellion:

You decide that tenderness
is not a liability.
That your doubt
is not a death sentence,
just a weather system
passing through a bigger sky.

You don’t slay anything.
You don’t ascend.
No choir sings.
You simply stay human
one more minute
than the monsters expected.

Out beyond the walls,
the city rolls over in its sleep,
a great animal of concrete and memory.
Streetlights blink.
A siren stretches across the dark
like a red thread pulled through fabric.

And somewhere in that vast, indifferent weave,
the universe makes a tiny notation
in the margin of your page:

“They got up again.
They didn’t believe the worst voice.
The story can continue.”

You crossed the bridge tonight
without borrowing a monster’s face.

2:34 a.m.
no longer feels like the mouth of hell—
just a narrow bridge
between who you were yesterday
and who you still stubbornly insist

1pjk5bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/itsthatbad/comments/1pjk5bx/two_stories_of_female_entitlement_and_male/,Two Stories of Female Entitlement and Male Objectification,"Hi gang, just want to share two recent stories of entitlement from female service workers. They both involve unprofessional treatment of me by conventionally attractive women in what should be professional settings. However, pretty girls these days suffer from Cinderella syndrome where they feel entitled to arbitrate and litigate that which is not theirs to do so.  
  
Story 1: Haircuts as a Sex Service  
I arrive at the barbershop for my appointment when a charming petite woman with dyed-red hair and blue eyes introduces herself as my barber. Unphased, I shake her hand and sit down. We talk about the haircut. I am prepared to pay 45 USD for a 45 minute appointment and “standard” cut. I fully expect to receive the same level of service as in the past. “Red” (we’ll call her) does not concur. “My time is worth more and I charge 65 USD for 45 minutes. You will only have 30 minutes and so I will not have enough time perform your request.” She asserts. I am aghast, why is this barber more expensive? The owner, himself, has cut my hair for the same rate. The transactional nature of her demands leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Suddenly, I feel like I am negotiating with a stripper. “What can I get?” I say. She proceeds to shave my sides and leave the top untouched.  
“What are you doing for Thanksgiving?” She asks.
“I am going to be by myself this year.” I say sullenly. This is the first year I will not return to Thanksgiving after going no-contact with my parents. It feels heavy in my heart.  
But before I can readjust, she responds, “I have a boyfriend.” *What?* I think as I wince. Surely she cannot be serious. She proceeds to wantonly cut my hair. I converse more to keep it friendly. I ask her about a coffee cup on her desk.  
“Do you like that coffee place?”  I ask, in an attempt to find common ground(s) [I love coffee].  
“I don’t know. A customer brought it for me.” She brags.  
*Ah* This young woman gets everything for free by virtue of looking like an emaciated Zooey Deschanel. She finished the haircut. I can tell it’s not great. I am not satisfied. I cannot verbalize just yet but later on I will demand a refund from the owner via email. I pay for it nonetheless.  
“It was good getting to know you.” She flirts in an attempt to pander for a tip. Two can be duplicitous.  
“Good job.” I say sarcastically, as I select a zero-percent tip. Later, I get chatGPT’s opinion on my haircut. ChatGPT opines that my hair is not blended and looks very rushed. I am livid at this sex-worker treatment. I email the owner politely demanding a refund, fully prepared to dispute the charge. He obliges. The 45 USD is returned to me but I doubt it comes out of her paycheck. It seems she is right, her time is worth more. But today, it will not be on my expense.  
  
Story 2: “Not for Here, to Go, Because I Say So”  
Today, I pop into a coffee shop for an afternoon mocha. The smart-faced girl asks me what size and I request 12 oz. Feeling tired from programming, I am compelled to ask how many shots of coffee it has. “How many shots does the 12 oz have?” I ask.  
“One and a half pumps.” She answers. *Pumps? Of coffee?* I think to myself. No, I can’t have that.  
“Is there anyway we can do two shots of espresso?”  
“It comes with two shots of espresso.” She asserts as she furls her eyebrows frustratingly.  
“Okay, thank you. I really need this coffee.” I quip. I pay and she speaks no more. Not a problem, I’m excited to drink this mocha in the shop and get back to my home office for more programming work on an exciting project of mine. Until, I receive my order in a to-go cup. *I said for-here*.  
“Did I say to go?” I asked, honestly. I am tired after all.  
“No.” She says bluntly.
“Can I get a mug please?” I demand politely. Without saying a word, she begrudgingly grabs a cup and saucer and hands it to me. No apology, no qualification. Livid, I barely need the coffee. I smile sarcastically and tilt my head in a patronizing manner. *Am I not allowed here?* I angrily think. *Is my 38-year-old face too gruff to be seen amidst the financiers and college students at the shop. Who is this arbiter of “who can stay and who cannot”?* I am a fit guy. Perhaps I should have worn a dress shirt to show my status. I make well-above six-figures. The barista comes around from the counter to clean the cafe section. I decide to objectify her by staring at her body. She certainly deserves no respect from. My states elucidate me. I see a thin waist and a long and round ass behind her apron. I am excited but then I am enlightened. A drop of mocha spills into my shirt because some of it spilled onto the saucer when I poured it. It’s hard to put my thoughts into words but I can’t help feel like other men experience the same thing I did today. Is my RBF so offensive? Is the slight amount of fat on my jaws that which disqualifies me to drink my coffee in peace at a hip shop? I stare some more as she bends over. *I can’t take anymore of these micro-aggressions*. Let me post on Reddit to gauge my peers’ opinions, I am resolved.  
  
Has social media uplifted every PAWG and every blue-eyed girl to a higher caste of person? I have confidence in my charisma and politeness. Most interactions I have with service people are neutral to pleasant. Yet, when I encounter some attractive women, the probability of a being taken advantage of or not being served properly goes up, in my mind. Has simp culture created a new breed of female Elliot Rodgers who equate gruff, unattractive faces with that of their oppressors? I didn’t create the economy ladies but I did learn a long time ago that I can’t rely on my charisma to pay the bills. TikTok has propagated Cinderella syndrome. But even worse, it has forced attractive women to bring their bias for attractiveness into their professional lives, as their brains decay, scroll by scroll, pop song to pop song, dance video to diss video. Put your phone down, ladies. Start thinking critically. Not all ladies but to the ones whose minds have been decayed by the rot of vanity.

***— Day 2 —***

I woke before the light reached the curtains. For a moment, I didn’t move, just stared at the chair still braced under the door handle, the way we’d left it last night. The sight alone pulled a ripple through my chest. The room felt smaller somehow, like it had been listening to us breathe.

El was asleep beside me, face turned toward the window, hair half-hidden under the quilt. She looked peaceful, maybe even happy, and that alone was enough to pull me back from the edge.

Whatever happened last night—it didn’t belong to her. I wasn’t going to let it.

I slid out of bed and stood by the chair for a long moment, my hand resting on its back, before I lifted it gently away from the door and set it against the wall like it was never there.

The air smelled faintly of rain and something sweet, like hay left too long in a warm barn. My chest loosened. A day could still be normal if I decided it would be.

Then came the sound of a bell from the main house: clear, distant, and sure of itself.

A knock followed almost immediately.

“Rise and shine!” Nick’s voice carried through the door, full of too much energy for morning. “Breakfast time, before they feed the chickens better than us!”

Hailey’s voice came next, muffled by laughter. “They probably already do.”

El stirred beside me, groaning softly. “Already?” she murmured, half-buried under the blanket.

“Yeah,” I said. “Bell means business.”

She smiled, eyes still closed. “Five minutes.”

I let her have ten.

We got dressed and stepped out into the crisp morning air. The sky was the color of wet paper, and the yard smelled fresh and quiet, like the night had rinsed it clean.

The kitchen felt alive when we entered.

Mae was already moving between the stove and the table, her apron tied neat, a strand of gray hair loose against her temple. Jonah was pouring coffee into mismatched mugs, and Clara sat at the table swinging her legs, humming something too gentle to be a tune. Ruth leaned by the window, arms crossed, watching the clouds with the face of someone who already knew the forecast.

“Morning, loves,” Mae said when she saw us. “Sleep treat you kindly?”

El smiled. “Mostly, yeah.”

Nick clapped me on the shoulder as we sat. “He had a rougher time. Heard something scratching around last night.”

I gave him a look. “Not scratching—breathing. There was—” I stopped when I saw Mae watching, curious but not surprised.

“The old house plays tricks,” she said easily. “Wood contracts at night. Sounds like sighing, sometimes.”

Jonah grinned. “Last week I woke up certain someone was trying to dig under the floorboards. Turned out to be the wind and a bad dream.”

Ruth didn’t turn from the window. “That’s the land settling. Happens every spring.”

Nick laughed. “See, Al? Science.”

El brushed my arm under the table, like saying *see, it’s fine.*

The table was laid with biscuits and jam, scrambled eggs, coffee dark enough to count as courage. Clara poured honey into her oatmeal like she’d done it every morning for a century. Everyone talked in small circles: Mae asking about the rooms, Jonah teasing Clara about sneaking sugar, Nick exaggerating our city lives to make them sound impressive.

I watched them all, waiting for someone to flinch—for some sign that the house hadn’t just been creaking. But the morning kept moving forward. The coffee was warm, the sunlight filled the window, and for a brief stretch of time, I believed maybe it really had been nothing.

Mae set down her mug. “Ruth’ll be taking you after breakfast,” she said. “Best to get hands in the dirt before the day gets too warm.”

Ruth nodded, still looking out the window. “Ground’s soft today. We’ll make good progress.”

El looked at me, smiling. “Sounds fun.”

“Depends what we’re planting,” I said, half-joking.

“Tomatoes,” Ruth answered without turning. “They like softer hands.”

\*\*\*

The fields glistened like the morning had just been poured over them. Dew clung to the weeds and fence posts, flashing white when the sun finally cleared the trees. Ruth led us past the tool shed and down toward the lower garden: a long slope of dark soil lined with crooked rows.

She walked ahead with that steady gait of someone who’d been doing the same route her entire life.

“Morning’s the best time to work,” she said over her shoulder. “The earth’s still listening.”

Hailey glanced at me, smirking. “Listening for what?”

Ruth didn’t miss a step. “For you to speak kindly.”

Nick snorted. “Ah shit, guess I better not swear then.”

“That’d be a start,” she said. 

Jonah had already gone off toward the barn, promising to send someone to help later, leaving the four of us alone with Ruth and a wagon full of tools. She handed out spades, rakes, and a few pairs of gloves that looked older than any of us.

“Pick a row,” Ruth said. “Loosen the soil, pull what’s not supposed to be there. Don’t worry about getting dirty. That’s how you know you’re doing it right.”

El immediately knelt and started working, gentle and methodical, fingertips brushing through the earth like she was searching for something delicate. Hailey crouched next to her, hesitated, then sighed and started tugging weeds with more force than accuracy. Nick, naturally, jumped into a new row, whistling as he worked. He had that kind of energy that didn’t fit the silence of the place—the kind that drew attention whether you wanted it or not.

Ruth drifted over to him after a few minutes, watching as he shoveled. “You’ve done this before,” she said.

“Something like it,” he said. “Worked a summer landscaping gig. Worst pay, best tan.”

Ruth smiled, the corner of her mouth lifting just enough. “You’ve got a good grip. But you’re doing all the work—you have to let the tool work for you.”

She stepped beside him, adjusted the way he held the shovel. Her hand rested on his forearm, light but deliberate.

“That’s better,” she said. “Now you’re helping the earth breathe.”

Hailey’s hands froze mid-motion. “Helping the earth breathe,” she repeated under her breath, pulling harder at a clump of weeds until it came up roots and all.

El noticed, tried to ease the air. “She’s just showing him form,” she said. “Ruth’s a pro.”

“Sure,” Hailey said, forcing a laugh. “Farm flirting. Totally normal.”

Ruth and Nick moved a few rows away to fix the angle of a post. I kept working, pretending not to hear Hailey start muttering to herself.

“Do you see that?” she said after a moment. “The touching, the giggling. It’s like a bad romance novel.”

El smiled, soft. “She’s twice our age, Hails.”

“Yeah, and she’s got twice the nerve.”

I looked over. Ruth was pointing at something in the soil, laughing at something Nick said, touching his arm—the sight clearly hit Hailey wrong. She threw her gloves down into the dirt.

“Okay, no, seriously. I’m saying something.”

“Hailey—” I started, but she was already walking across the rows, her boots sinking deep into the wet soil.

“Hey,” she called, voice bright and sharp. “Quick question—do you need my boyfriend’s biceps to farm tomatoes, or are we doing some kind of new workout here?”

Nick stiffened, turning toward her, shovel still in his hands. “Hails, don’t—”

Ruth straightened, calm as a statue. “You’re welcome to join us,” she said, voice level. “No need to ask permission.”

“I didn’t ask,” Hailey shot back. “I just thought maybe you were confused about who’s helping who.”

Ruth didn’t flinch. “The soil doesn’t care who’s jealous, dear,” she said. “Only who’s patient.”

The words landed like a slap disguised as advice. Hailey blinked, her face a mix of anger, confusion, and embarrassment. “Excuse me?”

Ruth turned back to her work, not even meeting her eye. “Excused.”

Hailey’s jaw tightened. “You—” she started, then stopped herself. Her chest rose like she might shout, but instead she spun around and stormed off toward the fence line.

Nick dropped the shovel and went after her, calling her name. Ruth didn’t watch them go. She just kept moving down the row, planting seeds one after another with precise, practiced care.

El and I stood there for a while, the quiet stretching between us.

“I’ll, uh… finish this one,” I said.

“Yeah,” El said softly. “Me too.”

Ruth didn’t look up as she spoke. “You two make a good pair,” she said. “Quiet hands do honest work.”

I wasn’t sure if it was meant kindly or not.

We worked in silence until the sun climbed higher, burning the dew off the soil. The rhythm of it was steady, almost hypnotic, the soft thud of dirt, the buzz of flies, the occasional distant clang from the barn. Every so often, Ruth would hum a strange half-melody. It didn’t sound happy or sad, just… practiced, like the ground expected it.

When she finally stood and brushed her hands clean, she looked toward the main house.

“That’s enough for the morning,” she said. “Lunch’ll be ready soon.”

I wiped my hands on my jeans and followed her gaze. Hailey and Nick were still standing by the fence up the property, their figures small against the field. They weren’t shouting anymore, but they weren’t touching either.

\*\*\*

By the time we got back to the main house, the air had turned heavy with heat. It clung to us, thick and sweet, carrying the smell of soil and cut grass. My shirt stuck to my back. El laughed when I tried to shake the dirt from my hands and only made it worse.

Mae was waiting on the porch with a pitcher of water and that unshakable calm she always carried, like she’d been standing there for hours just to see if we’d come back.

“You all look well-worn,” she said, smiling. “That’s a good sign. Means the land likes you.”

Ruth handed her gloves to Clara, who appeared at her side without sound. “They’ve got good hands,” Ruth said. “Quick learners.”

“Lunch is inside,” Mae said. “Eat before it cools. It’s stew today; Jonah’s recipe.”

El’s face brightened at that. “Smells amazing,” she said.

“Thank you, dear.” Mae’s eyes flicked to me for half a second. “You’re looking a bit pale. Sun catch you off guard?”

“I guess so,” I said, rubbing the back of my head. “I’ll wash up before we sit.”

She nodded once, like she already knew that would be the answer.

Inside, the dining room was dim and cool, the air thick with the scent of thyme and broth. Bowls and spoons were set neatly in a line across the long wooden table. The others were already finding their seats, but I slipped down the hallway toward the washroom, wiping my palms on my jeans.

The hallway felt longer than before, narrow, close, the boards beneath my boots creaking like they didn’t want to. A draft moved through it, carrying the faint smell of oil paint and dust. That’s when I noticed the portrait.

It hung across from the pantry door, larger than I’d realized, the varnish darkened with age. The frame was carved oak, worn smooth at the corners where fingers must’ve rested countless times.

The family.

They were all there: Mae seated at the center in a black dress, her hands folded neatly in her lap. Abel stood just behind her, his expression unreadable, eyes the same soft gray they were now. Ruth was off to the side, younger in posture but otherwise unchanged. Jonah wore a stiff suit, his mouth caught between a smile and a smirk. Silas looked barely out of boyhood, his hair slicked and his gaze sharp.

Behind them all, slightly apart, stood an older man, tall and thin, his shoulders stooped but his presence commanding. His skin was pale to the point of translucence, and his eyes, painted darker than shadow, seemed to follow from the frame itself. His hand rested on Clara’s shoulder, gentle yet possessive, as though anchoring the whole family in place.

Clara looked small and frail, the sickly pink of her cheeks painted too carefully to hide the pallor underneath. She couldn’t have been more than eight or nine in the painting. The others looked exactly as they did today. Time had moved for her, and no one else.

I leaned in, close enough to smell the varnish. The brushwork around Clara’s eyes was rougher, newer—someone had tried to fix her, to make her belong to the same moment as the rest of them. But it didn’t work. Her face looked borrowed.

The only one missing was Harlan. Though I’m sure if he were in it, they’d have to double the size of the portrait.

From the kitchen, chairs scraped against the floor. Someone laughed—Nick, by the sound of it. The normalcy of it all cut through the fog that had settled in my chest. I stepped back, nearly knocking into a small side table. My reflection wavered in the glass of the portrait: pale, uncertain, out of place.

When I rejoined the others, the conversation stumbled as I entered, then carried on like it hadn’t.

The stew was thick and rich, heavy with root vegetables. Hailey’s eyes were still red-rimmed, her smile forced, but she played along. Nick kept making jokes about fence-building like nothing had happened.

El brushed dirt from her sleeve. “I think I’m starting to like this,” she said, grinning at Mae. “It’s slower. Makes sense.”

“That’s the trick,” Mae said. “Everything here has its own pace. The land tells you when to rest.”

“Wish my foreman did that,” Nick said, earning a small laugh from everyone.

The silence that followed was thin but comfortable until Abel set his spoon down.

“Funny thing about pace,” he said, voice low but clear. “You can’t rush understanding. You can hurry your hands, but the ground—it’ll just wait for you to come back right.”

He looked around the table once, eyes settling nowhere. “Same with people.”

The table went still for a moment, caught between meaning and politeness.

Then Jonah clapped once, sharp enough to pull everyone out of it. “Well, that’s our sermon for the day. Amen to patience.”

Hailey smiled weakly. “I’ll drink to that,” she said, though her cup was empty.

Jonah chuckled. “Save it for tonight. We’ll have something to show you after supper.”

“Something?” El asked.

He winked. “A surprise.”

Mae smiled at that, her expression unreadable. “You’ll see. For now, eat up. There’s still work to be done.”

\*\*\*

The sun had settled high by the time we made it back outside. The air shimmered faintly above the dirt road, the kind of heat that buzzed more than it burned. Jonah was already waiting near the barn with a coil of rope slung over his shoulder and a hammer hanging from his belt.

“Hope you’re not all tuckered out,” he said, grinning. “Got a fence that’s been giving me attitude.”

Nick groaned, but it was good-natured. “You really know how to show your guests a good time.”

“That’s my specialty,” Jonah said, tossing him a pair of gloves. “Manual labor and bad jokes.”

We followed him down toward the lower field, where the property sloped gently toward the tree line. The fence stretched out in uneven rows, weathered gray boards held together more by stubbornness than nails. One section had splintered clean through, the rails bent inward like something heavy had pushed against it.

Jonah crouched to inspect the damage. “Old stag again,” he said. “Mean bastard’s got it in for me.”

El knelt beside him. “A stag did this?”

“That or a tractor with horns,” he said, straightening. “He’s been around longer than I’ve been alive. Big, ugly thing. Probably thinks we owe him rent.”

Nick laughed. “What, you two got a rivalry?”

“Oh, it’s personal,” Jonah said, dead serious for a beat, then smiled. “We’ll call it mutual respect.”

He passed out nails and a couple of short planks, directing each of us to a section. The work fell into rhythm quickly. Nick and Jonah hammered, El steadied posts, Hailey stacked wood, and I followed behind, clearing brush from the fence line. For a while, it almost felt like something normal: a group project, a shared task that existed for no other reason than to be done.

Hailey started to enjoy herself again once she found her groove. She was stronger than she looked, and Jonah noticed.

“Not bad with a saw,” he said. “Most people struggle to keep a straight line.”

She wiped sweat from her forehead, proud. “Guess I missed my calling.”

“Guess so,” Jonah said. “We’ll make a farmer outta you yet.”

El snorted. “She’s barely lasted without Wi-Fi.”

“Maybe,” Hailey said, smirking. “But I’ll still outwork you.”

Nick raised his hammer in mock salute. “Now there’s the woman I know.”

It was light and easy, laughter rolling down the field like wind through tall grass. For the first time since arriving, the air didn’t feel like it was hiding anything. The farm was just a farm. Work was just work.

El and I ended up near the end of the row, where the shade from the trees stretched long and cool. She nudged me with her shoulder. “You’re quiet,” she said.

“I’m working,” I said.

“Barely,” she teased, resting her chin on her arm. “You were born to supervise.”

“Someone’s got to make sure the dirt’s doing its job.”

She laughed, and it was the kind of laugh that loosened the knot behind my ribs. For a second, I forgot about last night, about the portrait, about everything except the sound of her voice.

Then, faintly, from somewhere beyond the barn, came a cry.

It wasn’t human, but it wasn’t entirely animal either—something caught between a howl and a wail, sharp enough to slice through the hum of work.

I looked up. “El,” I said quietly. “Did you hear that?”

She straightened, listening, but the sound didn’t come again. “What?”

“Something from the barn,” I said. “Like an animal in pain.”

She shrugged, still smiling, but less sure. “You get all kinds of noises on a farm. Could be anything.”

Jonah noticed me looking toward the sound. “That’s just our heifer,” he said easily. “Due any day now. When she starts hollerin’, means she’s close. Whole ordeal sounds worse than it is.”

“Ah,” I said. “Right.”

He grinned. “Trust me, son, if it was something worth worrying about, Ruth’d already be yelling.”

That seemed to settle it for everyone else. Work carried on, nails sinking into wood, the smell of sap and sweat in the heat. But I couldn’t shake the edge of that sound. It hadn’t been a cow. It had sounded… wrong.

Another cry came, shorter, lower, more like a sob than a scream.

No one else reacted.

I stood up, pretending to stretch. “I’m gonna hit the washroom,” I said.

Jonah didn’t even look up. “Don’t gotta ask for permission, we got it handled here,” he said, laughing.

“No doubt about that,” I said, shooting a wink at El.

I walked up toward the path that led back to the house, keeping my pace easy until I was out of sight. Then I turned, cutting behind the hedgerow, the sound of hammering fading until all I could hear was the slow, dragging moan of something alive and hurting.

The closer I got to the barn, the thicker the smell became: iron and straw, wet and sour. The big double doors were half open, one swaying slightly on its hinge. Inside, the air was dim and heavy.

I stopped just before the threshold, heart pushing against my ribs. A voice carried from within: light, sing-song, unmistakably Silas.

“Easy now, easy. No sense fightin’. You’re already halfway to art.”

Then a grunt: low, guttural. Harlan.

Something hit the floor with a wet sound. A blade scraped against wood.

Silas laughed softly. “See? Told you she’d stop kickin’. They always do.”

Another sound: the tearing slide of hide coming away from muscle. My stomach turned.

I inched forward, just enough to see shapes moving in the dark. Silas stood over a workbench, sleeves rolled to his elbows, hands slick with blood. Harlan loomed beside him, holding down what was left of a goat, or maybe a deer, it was hard to tell anymore. Hooks hung from the ceiling, each carrying some different kind of animal. Some were fresh, others had dried, curled edges, almost leathery.

“Clara’ll like this one,” Silas said, wiping his hands on a cloth that had once been white. “Smaller hides are her favorite. Softer to stitch.”

Harlan didn’t answer, just kept working.

Silas tilted his head, admiring his handiwork. “Almost ready for tomorrow night.”

That phrase landed hard. *Tomorrow night.*

I backed away before I could hear more. My boots whispered against the dirt, slow and careful until I reached the open air again.

When I got back to the field, everyone was still working. El waved when she saw me, smiling like nothing had changed.

“You okay?” she asked when I got close enough.

“Yeah,” I said, my throat dry. “Just—just needed a breather.”

Jonah looked up from where he was kneeling. For a second, his eyes met mine, calm, unreadable, too steady. Then he smiled.

“Alright, folks,” he said, brushing his hands together. “That’s enough for today. Go wash up, get cleaned, and put on something nice. We’ve got a bit of fun planned for tonight.”

\*\*\*

By the time the sun began to fall, the air had softened again. The heat that had pressed down all afternoon broke into a slow, golden warmth that made everything glow.

We changed in the rooms, rinsed the dirt from our arms, and stepped back outside as the bell rang again. This one was lower, slower; not the breakfast bell, not the call to work. Something different.

The whole farm seemed to hum beneath it.

Jonah met us by the main house, wearing a clean shirt and that easy grin that never quite reached his eyes. “Perfect timing,” he said. “Follow me.”

We trailed behind him up the gentle slope past the gardens until the land opened into a wide clearing. The sun hung low, a copper disc resting just above the tree line. Someone had set up long tables, unlit lanterns, and an old wooden drum near the center.

The rest of the family was already there. Ruth stood beside Mae, both barefoot in the grass. Abel leaned on his cane, face unreadable as ever. Silas and Harlan were hauling crates toward the side of the field, moving in quiet rhythm. Clara sat cross-legged on the ground, weaving flowers into what looked like a garland made of bone and twine.

“Welcome to our little tradition,” Jonah said, turning to face us. “Happens every season or so. Helps the land breathe again.”

Mae smiled, her hands folded neatly. “The Stillwater Festival,” she said softly. “You’ll see why.”

It started with a sound: the first deep hit of the drum. Jonah’s hand struck it slow and deliberate, once, then again, until it fell into a heartbeat rhythm that carried through the grass.

The others began to join. Abel clapped along, off-beat but steady. Silas lifted a carved wooden flute to his lips and played a thin, trembling note that hung over the rhythm like fog. Ruth picked up a pair of small stones and knocked them together in time, her face turned toward the setting sun.

Then Mae began to sing.

Her voice wasn’t loud, but it filled the field like smoke: low, wordless, rising and falling with the drum. The melody didn’t sound human, not exactly; it moved in strange intervals, like something ancient and remembered rather than written.

The guests—us—didn’t know what to do at first. El looked around, eyes wide, a mix of wonder and disbelief. Nick laughed quietly under his breath, but it wasn’t mocking, just nervous. Hailey squeezed his hand. Even she seemed caught by it.

Then the rhythm deepened. Jonah hit the drum harder, faster, the sound echoing off the treeline until it felt like the whole valley was shaking in heartbeats. Harlan and Clara stomped wildly with bare feet. Silas’s flute became frantic, the notes sharp and uneven. Ruth’s stones clacked faster, and Abel began to hum low in his chest, matching the pitch of the earth.

The air itself seemed to change: thicker, charged. The smell of rain came before the first drop fell.

Mae’s song grew louder, her voice breaking apart into syllables that didn’t sound like language. The family began to move, not in choreographed steps but in a raw, instinctive motion: swaying, turning, stamping. The guests followed, half-laughing, half-drawn into it.

El grabbed my hand. “Come on,” she said.

Her eyes were bright, hair already clinging to her face. I let her pull me in. We moved with them, clumsy at first, then less so. The drum beat faster. The ground seemed to answer.

The rain came hard and sudden, but no one stopped. It only made everything louder: the slap of wet feet on grass, the hiss of water hitting skin. Nick whooped, spinning Hailey in a circle until they both fell into the mud laughing. Mae threw her head back, singing into the downpour like she was summoning it. Ruth clapped along with the thunder.

And for the first time since we’d arrived, I felt something like peace. Not calm, not safety, but a wild, electric surrender.

Everyone was laughing, shouting, stomping, their voices and the drum merging into one sound that belonged to no one. The line between family and guest, host and stranger, blurred until there wasn’t one.

Then I saw him.

At the edge of the field, half-hidden by the trees, a figure stood still while everyone else moved. Tall, thin, his outline warped by the curtain of rain. He didn’t join in. He just watched.

Even from that distance, I knew it was a man. The way he held himself: rigid, rooted. The others either didn’t notice or pretended not to.

A flash of lightning lit the field, and for an instant I saw his face. Pale, long, eyes like empty sockets. Then the light was gone.

The music slowed. The rain softened. Jonah gave one last strike to the drum and stepped back, breathing hard, smiling. “That’s what I call worship,” he said, half to himself.

Laughter rippled through the field. People were drenched, exhausted, grinning. El pressed her forehead to mine, her breath warm despite the cold rain.

“This place,” she whispered, “it’s kind of magic, isn’t it?”

I smiled back, but behind her, I looked toward the trees again. The figure was gone.

Jonah approached, his hair plastered to his forehead. “Hell of a night,” he said, clapping me on the shoulder. “Sorry about the noise earlier. Didn’t want to spoil the mood.”

“The heifer?” I asked, though I already knew.

He nodded once, the kind of nod that meant nothing. “Everything’s handled. You’ll see what it was all for soon enough.”

Then he grinned again, wide and easy. “Now go on. Get dry. Tomorrow’s gonna be a big day.”

We stumbled back toward the house, drunk on wine, music, rain, and something else I couldn’t name. El laughed at nothing, her hair dripping onto my shirt. From the open fields behind us, the drum sounded one last time: a single, deep pulse that rolled through the night and faded into silence.

When we got back to the room, we were too tired to talk. El collapsed onto the bed, still smiling. “You can hear them,” she said, half-asleep. “Nick and Hailey. Sounds like they made up quickly.”

“Guess the music worked,” I said.

She laughed softly, eyes closed. “I love it here.”

I turned off the lamp. Rain whispered against the window. My body was heavy, my mind even heavier. For a while, I thought maybe I’d dream of the music, or of El dancing, or of nothing at all.

But when I woke in the middle of the night, the door was open. Just a crack.",1,1765414823.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1pjk48v,https://i.redd.it/i4yfueuhyg6g1.png,Onyx ECHELON 2026 - Blowing The Whistle,"Hi all! Long-time reader, but I finally decided to make an account in order to call out this nonsense and offer an alternative for both the budget-conscious Onyx enjoyer and the generally curious.

I recall that Onyx has a [reputation](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1grm0rs/onyx_echelon_2025/) on this sub for having solid product for exorbitant pricing, especially given how many excellent specialty roasters have sprouted up over the past 5ish years. Regardless, I've personally taken an interest in their offerings over time and have been keeping an eye on what they put up on their webstore. Worth noting: I am not affiliated with the company, but am both a student and a critic of their product and marketing strategy. There's no denying that they've hooked a certain type of customer.

ECHELON is a subscription program that has been going since their 10th anniversary in 2022. In short, this is a per-month subscription program that provides the equipment, the recipes, the additives (probably Third Wave Water or similar), and ""extraordinary coffee"".

Poring through the site, it seems as if this subscription ($1,750 just for the base coffee subscription + a $1,150 equipment add-on) might actually be optional. As it turns out, each month's coffee appears to be something that you can add to cart and buy without being signed up. The product page is locked behind some sort of check for if you are signed up for the subscription, but it's pretty flimsy.

Here is a cart link for the [Colombia Inmaculada Eugenioides - 10oz](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/checkouts/cn/hWN6Hu9XHMcKLZADhdnFWoPR) ($75 for 10oz, \~40 boxes in stock as of posting, still astonishingly expensive), and a description:

    This is it, the coffee that took the coffee world by storm. Winning not only the 2021 U.S. Barista Championship in the hands of Andrea Allen, but also 1st place in the World Barista Championship of 2021. This is one of the most decorated coffees in history, and one of the most unique coffees we roast and prepare each year. We are excited to bring it to our Echelon subscribers for 2025. 

I would not be surprised if this post rocks the boat and presses them to change the way that the website works, but if there is interest in seeing each month's coffee offering, I will happily post them here in the following months. Thanks for reading.",0,1765414770.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

It’s a beautiful morning, with a pleasant chill in the air and my coffee tasting amazing. It’s easy to assume that everything is perfect in my life. But the opposite is true. At work and home, I’m dealing with stresses, some of which I can control and others that I can’t. I’m not alone in this. I see people around me doing their best to cope with difficult situations, some similar to mine and others quite different. On the surface, someone may appear to have it all together, like nothing bothers them and everything is going well. But on the inside, they might be fighting a battle, one they’re struggling with every day.

The author in me likes to compare our lives to a book. Each page represents a day in our lives. Some pages are filled with exciting adventures and meaningful conversations, while others are mundane and forgettable. Regardless of what happened on the previous page, the next page starts blank. We write the page through our actions and perspectives. We may think we know what will happen on each page, but that’s not how it works. Each of us will perceive things differently, experience things differently, and interpret things differently. That’s okay, in fact, that’s how the world works. We can have expectations for experiences, but there are no guarantees that anything will happen as we wish. It’s up to us to find a way to flow with the unexpected.

I’m writing this because it’s been a challenging week in education. Many of my fellow teachers are juggling personal and professional responsibilities, and they still come to work to face difficult classroom situations. The teachers I work with are incredibly resilient, and their ability to adapt and handle these challenges is truly commendable.

Every Friday, we always have a small celebration to mark the end of the week and the start of the weekend. However, this time, many of my coworkers, including myself, looked defeated. It’s easy to question our effectiveness and wonder if we’re making a difference, especially when work and home life pile on stress.

I don’t have a magical solution to alleviate this stress, but I try to remind myself that each day is a fresh start. We navigate the chaos of life with the confidence of a seasoned sea captain, sometimes facing rough seas and other times enjoying smooth sailing.

Perhaps our lives are like books, filled with logs that record our journeys. So, my fellow captains, embrace the rough seas ahead and cherish the smooth days. Find your port, rest, and relax. Document your experiences and use them to guide you through the future.

I am naturally an introvert, so Chloe was my best friend in many respects.

She was truly a companion like no other. When I lost her I knew I wanted to memorialize her in someway but also kind of wanted others to feel the urgency of gratitude for their animal and human companions because no matter how much we love them, they all have to go someday.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:

I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is;  the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other. I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living in Japan right now, or already in the US)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:

You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Reply with:

* One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
* Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or US city)
* One question for me

First five thoughtful replies get a 60-second calm voice note (English or Japanese).

I’m patient and only looking for one person.

I do expect that I have ADHD for other reasons than this one.**

I’ve noticed that every single time I have chocolate, hot cocoa, coffee, etc. I start to get really tired and heavy and calm, and I can literally keep one train of thought. I don’t really like this feeling, other than the quiet brain, and I often will take a nap to stop feeling this way. 

Blood sugar: I originally thought it was reactive hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia but I’ve tested my blood sugar multiple times and it was completely normal for having just eaten. 

Blood pressure: My blood pressure is always slightly elevated afterwards as a normal reaction to caffeine (average of maybe 125/90 when my normal is 105/65, give or take). Usually, my POTS makes me feel this way if my blood pressure dropped and that is never the case. 

Heart rate: My heart rate is also usual for having just eaten (tyachacardic but it’s normal for me so 🤷‍♀️).

Additionally: Caffeine also makes me dissociate from my personality more than usual and super talkative, all while still being calm. The only difference is that I can keep one train of thought other than having my thoughts tangential. I also have a lot easier of a time remembering words. 

Also, interestingly, I rarely feel more anxious or jittery or awake on caffeine, just really tired and focused but also not focused. Idk how to describe it. 

I also don’t ever feel this way with other foods, drinks, or sugary things. It’s just chocolate, with coffee being the worst reaction.

My only problem is that this makes me want to avoid all caffeine containing things bc of how tired and spacey I feel when I have them.

**Does this sound like it would be ADHD related intolerance, anxiety intolerance, usual intolerance that some people have, or not related to the caffeine at all?**

Fingers darted, twisted, pressed and secured parts with mechanical precision. Their owners spread along a factory line, their eyes looking elsewhere. These used to be jobs requiring full focus, now they have transformed into something entirely different.

A closer look behind the rectangular masks each one of them wore, one could see a worker's eye, unblinking and wide. Reflecting the flickering light of a screen.

The screen showed a scene from a movie: a dramatic chase sequence. The worker’s pupil adjusting slightly as the action intensified. What was on their head was a sleek visual headset, wrapped around the upper half of their face, covering both eyes. From one nostril, another thin wire extended downward, slick with lubricant, trailing into a socket on a small device clipped onto their uniform.

Among them was one pair of hands. Mine. They moved with precision. I tightened screws, clicked plastic into place, the rhythm unbroken. I relaxed in the distant world inside my headset. A sudden laugh escaped my lips. A joke from the stream had landed perfectly! The joy of it echoed in a humming factory, otherwise verbally silent.

I prefer it this way, it's nice being able to escape.

Rows of my fellow workers, all wired, all engrossed in their virtual distractions, our bodies on autopilot. On the outside of the factory, a bright clean digital billboard glowed. It advertises yXX’s newest job platform with a cheerful slogan: “Work While Watching - Make Time Work for You”. People my age called these drone jobs, while corporate liked to call them: “Automated body careers.”

A buzzer rang, sharp and final. The shift was over.

I slowly removed my headset and blinked against the sudden change in light. With practiced ease, I pinched the tube near the corner of my eye and slid it free. A soft click, a faint sting, the nasal wire followed, slick and warm. I tugged it from my nose and it coiled up. Around me others were doing the same, the ritual of unplugging reappeared across the room.

Over the Intercom came the ding of an announcement.

“Crew we are happy to announce that tomorrow we will be having a mandatory meeting a half an hour before shift starts”

I groaned softly.

“We are one of the lucky locations that is being selected for the new yXX update and we need all employees here to go through the onboarding presentation. Thank you all. Again, arrive thirty minutes before your shift for the presentation” Another ding sounded, signaling the end of the announcement.

At the clock out station, one of my coworkers and long time friend named Natalie came over with bright eyes and an energetic grin that I returned to her.

“That’s great news we just got. I can finally work on sussing out this D&D campaign I’ve been writing.” She grabbed her bag out of her locker.

“How d’you plan on doing that?”

“Haven't you heard the rumors?” She stared at me for a moment waiting for a response. She shook her head in slight disapproval. “I guess not, huh? Well the update is going to let us do more than just watch streams or movies”

“Oh so you figure it'll have like a notepad program?”

“That's part of the rumor! Also a web browser.” Scanning her badge with a beep. “Ahh! One of the first facilities to test it in real time!”

“Hell yeah” I responded, genuinely enthused. “I’ve been wanting to read some comics instead of just streaming. I’ve gone through everything on my to watch backlog. It’s really perfect timing”

 “Nice.” she smiled.

I watched her head into her car as we parted ways in the parking lot. We waved goodbye as she left.

——————————

The walk home was slow and quiet. Lights buzzed faintly overhead, and the hot breath of summer lingered in the air. I felt the familiar feeling of my legs aching and my shoulders heavy with fatigue. I rubbed my hands absentmindedly, the fingers still twitching slightly as if still assembling something.

My mind might be able to wander during work hours, but boy, my body is tired.

In the quiet comfort of my apartment, I reflected on the strange innovation that had become my reality. These headsets from yXX had changed everything. The old days of robotic automation had failed. Errors causing scrap, expensive maintenance, and just too much downtime.

Human minds, it turned out, were more reliable.

So, someone had the bright idea: keep the human brain, discard the conscious thought. With the right neural interface, the wires, the syncing, the gentle nudges to the motor cortex.

People could work without actually thinking about it. And while it paid 30% less than traditional automation jobs, it didn’t matter. The demand was overwhelming. People lined up for the chance to be a part of it.

I leaned back staring at the ceiling lost in thought, imagining what the new update would bring. “Soon.” a grin spread across my face

It won’t just be a glorified streaming box anymore. With programs? The possibilities are endless.

—————————————————-

I woke up and got ready for the morning. I fixed my short messy hair in the mirror. I was still tired, not from a bad night of sleep. But the tiredness that came with doing menial labor 10 hours a day.

Before heading out, I dropped onto the couch for a moment. I looked at my phone, with its quiet glow I scrolled through the list I had made. Comics I’ve been meaning to read, articles and topics I’d bookmarked for deep dives. History, tech and obscure fiction. I also put a rough note about budgeting a trip to a city I’ve been meaning to visit.

It was the middle of the week, I headed out to meet Natalie at our usual breakfast spot. A cheap place with good endless black coffee. Which more than made up for the old mugs and wobbly tables. It was our ritual, a small resistance against the bland monotony of the week.

I ordered a bagel, and as always, the bottomless house coffee. I filled up my mug at the self-serve dispenser. Natalie was already seated, tapping at her phone with one hand and grabbing a warm mug with the other.

“Yo” She gave a mock salute when she saw me bringing over my food and cup. I smiled back.

We chatted for a while about shows we recently finished. Then Natalie spoke with a slightly serious tone in her voice. “Did you finally figure out if you’re going back to school?” She asked, then took a big bite of toast. We talked about it last week, and I asked her to check up on me about it the next time we met. “Not yet, I wanted a few more months of freedom before I get into it again.”

She laughed, nudging my shoulder “That’s what you said six months ago, man! C’mon, hear me out. If the rumors are true…with that new update at work? You could totally sign up for classes. Study during your shift. Do your homework while you are droning. It’s perfect.”

She frowned a bit “Neither of us want this to be our jobs for the rest of our lives, right?” I groaned, “Yeah, yeah… you’re right.” Bodies can only do this type of work for so long before chronic pain sets in.

The truth stung a little bit more than I expected. I’d wanted to go back to school for a while now, and somehow, that desire had gotten buried beneath streaming queues and half-finished to-do lists. It felt stupid to admit it out loud.

Maybe tomorrow I’d look up enrollment deadlines. Or maybe later today, during work.




——————————————

The factory was rumbling with excitement. Normally, the shift would begin with the usual quiet hum of preparation. Everyone walking towards their stations to slip on their distractions. Instead, we gathered in the makeshift “meeting room,” which was really just the on-site gym reconfigured with rows of folding chairs and a cheap projector screen.

Everyone was talking, buzzing with speculation. We’d only seen glimpses of the new yXX update through teaser videos and limited press releases. Nothing solid. Today we finally were getting something official. I sat among my coworkers, the folding chair creaking faintly under me, watching as the yXX rep took the stage in front of us. She was corporate as they come: smooth voiced, efficient, and constantly smiling in that slightly too wide way that let you know she’d given this same presentation 3 times this week.

She clicked her device, walking us through the features. The new desktop interface would be layered over the old one, allowing us to organize our screens like we would at home. Tabbing between media players, readers, and even basic software. Not everything would work though, graphic intensive programs or anything requiring fine motor input would be off the table. But for most of us, it was enough. “Eye tracking will still be the main form of control,” she explained, her laser pointer tracing over a diagram of a pupil with a vector arrow. “But yXX2 features increased precision. You should notice fewer mis-clicks and better responsiveness”

YXX2? This wasn’t just a patch or visual upgrade. This was a new model.

She paced with practiced rhythm, anticipating questions before anyone had a chance to ask them. Then, she directed our attention to the printed packet each of us had
been handed on the way in. A slim folder of glossy paper with onboarding checklists and feedback forms. The front cover had the yXX logo: A stylized keyhole with circuit board elements that branched out downward,  all encompassed in a circle. I flipped through my packet as she continued to speak.

● What types of applications do you regularly use at home?
● What types of tools or features would you like to see in yXX2?
● Do you experience eye fatigue more easily or visual blurring at the end of your typical shift?
● Have you noticed symptoms of vision sickness since the beginning of headset usage?
● Is there a noticeable delay between your eye movement and the system cursor?

The questions were framed casually, but I could tell they were taking this rollout seriously. This was a new infrastructure, a new way to live your life on the clock.

“A reminder to everyone, the NDA’s that are a part of your contract still apply to this version.”

Eventually, the presentation wrapped up to scattered applause. One by one, we lined up to receive small black box clips. Our new sync units for the upgraded firmware. They were sleek, matte, and a bit bigger than the size of a match box. They looked harmless, almost elegant. Like before, we were instructed to attach them to the reinforced loops on our uniforms.

I ran my fingers over the clip’s surface. This little box was the bridge to something I hadn’t experienced yet. The excitement I felt dropped into a kind of anxiety as my fingers traced the ridges and buttons along the edge.


——————————————

We went to our stations one by one, my new headset waiting for me. I slid the slick cord into my nose and it wriggled deep inside, a sensation I’d long since grown used to. Then came the headset itself, it looked the same mostly. Just a different color. I placed it over my eyes and activated the new sync unit clipped to my collar. The headset hummed softly as it scanned my retinas and adjusted the silicone tube, guiding it between my sclera and the inner fold of my eye.

As it settled in, gripping onto parts of my brain, my hands pressed the start button on the conveyor. They moved without thought, beginning their shift. My eyes were introduced to the new OS.

YXX2 was sleek and user friendly. Icons floated on the screen with the yXX company key logo on the background. Using what I remembered from the presentation, I moved through the apps. Now simply by moving my eyes to look at what I wanted to navigate to, and then a sharp thought of tapping on it. A huge improvement from the old system, no more blinking in patterns to select anything.

I wandered through the menus and found the internet browser and the app hub. There were only about thirty apps available at this launch but I browsed through them casually.

Ah, they have a version of maps.

I liked the idea of gradually taking a walk in another city during company time. A bunch of the apps were things that you’d find on any mobile device outside of work. Simple games like flippy bard, match 3’s, sand color sorting, and sudoku. Y’know, in case you wanted to get your mother in law a job here.

Looking through the apps I found one listed as a file name, Halcyon.app. There was no preview image for it. No icon. No description. Just the name, rendered in default system font , and a small file size. The moment I opened it the entire headset white-screened and my hands froze mid motion.

There was a deep pulse through me, and then the sync unit on my chest whirred. A soft reset triggered, and the mechanical movements of my fingers began again.

I guess that app isn’t finished yet.

The rest of the shift flew by as I explored the menus.

————————————————————

Later, at the time clock, Natalie caught up to me. Her usual energy dulled just a little, maybe from excitement fatigue. “Did you end up going on the university website?” Natalie asked as we scanned out.

“I did… but I forgot my username and password so…” I trailed off quickly. “How about you? Did you work on your campaign?”

“No,” She admitted, grinning sheepishly. “I got totally distracted by all of the apps.”

“Ha! You didn’t do your thing either.” I nudged her. “To be honest, I was distracted for like… the first 8 hours.”

She laughed. “My brain forgot I had goals.”

We walked together through the parking lot, our footsteps echoing on the cracked asphalt. The sky had that smudged-orange look it always got near the end of shift, like it was as tired as we were. Natalie stretched her arms behind her head and let out a groan. “I swear, these updates make everything more fun, but somehow I still feel like I got hit by a truck.”

“It’s cause your mind is still in bed,” I said, rubbing the back of my neck. “Only your body shows up to work now.”

“Yeah well,” she shot me a look, “that part of me doesn’t get paid, so it stays home.” We both laughed at that…too hard, maybe. The kind of laugh that leaks out when everything else in your life feels like it’s on autopilot.

We reached her car, and instead of me heading down the block, I leaned against her rear door for a moment.

She didn’t unlock it.

“You good?” she asked. I hesitated, then shrugged. “I don’t know. I keep thinking about what you said. About school. About not letting this be our life forever.”

Her face softened. “It’s not just about school. It’s about momentum, you know? If you wait too long, you start believing it’s already too late.”

I didn’t respond right away.

“Sorry,” she added quickly. “That came out more dramatic than I meant.”

“No, it’s okay,” I said. “You’re right. It’s just… I think I’m afraid if I start, maybe I’ll realize how long I’ve been standing still.”

Natalie looked at me for a second, like she was trying to decide whether to hug me or hit me with more reality. Instead, she reached into her bag and handed me a crumpled napkin.

Scrawled in marker was a note:

“Enroll, dummy.”

Underneath was a smiley face with devil horns.

I grinned. “What, is this some kind of hex?”

“It’s a reminder,” she said. “Stick it on your fridge. Or your forehead.” The car beeped as she unlocked it. “Tomorrow. You don’t even have to enroll. Just check the deadlines. One step.” She got in, rolled the window down. “Also, if you don’t do it, I’m making Flippy Bard your start up program until you snap.”

“You wouldn’t.”

“Try me.”

She gave a half wave and drove off.

I stood there with the napkin in my hand a little longer than I meant to, watching her tail lights disappear. Then I started walking down the sidewalk, smiling like an idiot.



Chapter 2

The next day at work I handed in my feedback form to the same woman who gave us the presentation yesterday. My response was mostly positive, at least on paper. Under the additional comments I had made a note about the app that glitched out and white screened.

When I mentioned it out loud to her the rep was unfazed.

“We have already implemented some bug fixes overnight, due to some employees turning in their questionnaires at the end of shift yesterday. The problem might have already been resolved.” She gave the same plastic grin from yesterday. “We hope there are no further issues.” 

“Uh. thanks” I nodded, turning away with a frown pulling at my mouth. Natalie was looking at me from the locker area. As I walked towards her I could see her expression was a bit duller than normal. 

“Mornin’” Her voice lacked her usual vigor.

“Hey, same to you.” I smiled trying to inject some warmth into the moment. “Good news, I looked up enrollment last night. I even scheduled an appointment to talk to an advisor next week.”

With a slight smile, she exhaled in tired relief. “That’s great.”

“You doing okay?” It wasn’t really a question. It was clear she wasn’t.

She opened her mouth, hesitating.

“Well…I-“ 

The buzzer cut her off. We both flinched, instinctively glancing at the clock.

“Shit,” I muttered. “We’re not at our stations.”

Natalie gave a quick nod. “Later,” she said.

“Yeah.”

We peeled off toward our respective areas with the silent understanding that whatever she was going to say. Whatever was really going on, would be addressed at next break.

Until then I tried to keep busy with word puzzle games, and music. But my brain wouldn't work the way I wanted to.

————————-

When I walked into the break room, I spotted her already sitting at a table, sipping a drink from the vending machine. She looked… better. Not perfect, but clearer than this morning.

“You look more alive,” I said, grabbing a seat across from her. “That morning fog wore off?”

“Yeah,” she said, with a shrug. “Honestly, I felt like garbage this morning. But once I hooked into the headset... I don’t know. I must’ve nodded off. Slept until right before the bell for break went off.""

“You what?” I raised an eyebrow. “You fell asleep?”

She nodded, totally casual.

“How? Your eyes have to stay open for the sync unit to work properly. That’s, like, the whole thing.”

“I don’t know,” she said, lowering her voice slightly. “But on 2, apparently... you can.”
That left me blinking for a second.

“You’re serious?”

She smiled faintly. “Well, I didn’t get written up. So either it worked, or a supervisor didn’t notice. Either way, I’m not complaining.”

I leaned back in my chair, a bit worried about how dismissive she was.

“Well… you do look better.” I said slowly, ""Guess if you’re lying, the production logs will snitch on you.”

She laughed, but the sound was quieter than usual.

“I don’t remember anything about sleeping being possible in the paperwork.” I added.

She gave a shrug. “Maybe it’s not a feature. Maybe it’s just something the system allows now.”

I didn’t press the point, but her explanation didn’t sit right.

“So, what wiped you out?” I asked. “Did you stay up too late?”

“No, it wasn’t that,” she said. “I kept waking up in the middle of the night. One of those nights where you’re dreaming so hard you jolt yourself awake.”

“…Nightmares?”

She frowned a little. “Not exactly. Just… intense.”

The buzzer rang again, louder than before. Or maybe, I was just more on edge.

We stood up, heading towards the door. “You gonna be okay?” I asked as we tossed our wrappers.

“Hopefully.” She said with a nervous smile.

————————-


Returning to work, I noticed something surprising. Halcyon had an icon now. It was faint, almost translucent. A pale symbol that looked like a mini upsilon () and an H next to it.

I stared at it.

It looks like it was fixed.

Maybe now I could actually see what it was supposed to do. I hovered my gaze on it, hesitating… I opened it.

The screen blinked once.
Then again.
Then again, faster and faster.

Like a strobe light revving up, or a heartbeat skipping out of sync. My unit was whirring. Lines of text skidded across the display. Unreadable, Half formed instructions or code, disappearing too fast to make anything out.

And then everything went white. 

I felt the pulse again.

I was back. Standing at the same workstation. Components in my hands. Same steady movements of my fingers. Annoyance flickered through me. Not just at the app, but at myself for trying it.

Had I…?

No. No, I didn’t fall asleep. I was just zoning out. I didn’t feel unconscious. Not really. Just…floaty. Disoriented. My playlist had skipped forward by two songs. I glanced at the product counter. It was ahead by a few dozen units.

I clenched my jaw and shook it off.

Okay. Lesson learned.

No more opening it.

The end of shift alarm rang out. Reflexively, everyone began unplugging in unison. A sea of hands rose to the headsets, sliding their wires free. I removed mine slower than usual. My eyes adjusting. Breathing shallow like I was coming out of anesthesia. 

I scanned the shop floor for Nat, a bit more sensitive to the light around me. I had started developing a migraine. I didn’t want to wait, I pulled a pair of sunglasses out of my locker and headed out.

The walk home was slow and the heat pressed down on me like a second body. What normally was a 10 minute walk, turned into 20. I drifted past the usual land marks, slowly my shoulders became heavier and my feet dragged across the pavement. The moment I got inside I dropped my keys down, removed my shoes and sweaty socks, and stumbled straight into bed.

———————-

When I woke, the light in the room had shifted, and my head throbbed. A dull, nagging ache that pulsed behind my eyes. I popped a painkiller and chased it with a cold glass of water.

“Ugh” I muttered aloud, pressing my palm to my forehead. “This sucks.”

I called in sick and stretched out on the couch with a damp washcloth draped across my brow. It felt like a hangover. 

A notification ping broke the stillness. I reached for my tablet and saw a message from Nat.

""You bailed on work? Weak.""

I smirked, even though my head still felt like it was full of static. My vision shimmered faintly. I blinked, but it didn’t go away.

""Yeah. Called in sick. Head’s killing me. Thought I was gonna pass out on the walk home last night.""

Another ping.

""RIP. You good? You’re not the only one who called out today.”

That made my stomach twist a little.

""O? What did they say?”

""Something about the refresh rate or light calibration. One of the floor leads said he was gonna file a report if more people drop.""

I hesitated, then typed:

""U ok tho? No headache?""

She didn’t reply for a few minutes. Then:

""Felt off earlier. Better now. You up to rally later for some post-shift pancakes?""

I stared at the screen. My fingers were sluggish, like they didn’t quite belong to me.
My vision faltered, the screen looking like it was underwater.

""Maybe...""

The tablet slipped out of my hand in the bed. I didn’t catch it.

And then I drifted off again. 

My dreams were vivid and stressful. I was alone on a grey beach, forced to count each grain of sand. When I lost track, something descended . My punishment was disassembly, my body taken apart, each piece sealed into rough metal. I fell endlessly, waiting to hit the ground.

I jolted awake with my heart racing in fear. The pain in my head, however, had passed. I felt so helpless in that moment.

With a long exhale to steady my emotions, I sat up and checked the time. 5:00pm. Nat will be getting out in an hour.

——————-

By the time I got to the diner, the sun had dipped behind the buildings. I entered the diner and Natalie was already seated in a booth near the back as usual, a mug of coffee slowly steaming on the table.

She looked up as I slid into the seat across from her. “Hey, corpse,” she said with a crooked smile. “You made it.”

“Barely.” I took a long drink from the ice water “I think I melted into the sidewalk twice on the way here.”

“Ugh, I feel that. Thank god they need to have the shop cool because of the headset hardware.” We both paused in relief, imagining what a hellhole it would be.

“Have you heard anything else? About the headset issues?”

Natalie shifted in her seat, looking into her mug like it had answers. “Not really. Just… that a few people complained of headaches. One person said their eyes wouldn’t track right for a while. The rep shrugged it off mostly. Said it was calibration fatigue.”

“Calibration fatigue.” I rolled the words around like something bitter.

She shrugged. “To be honest.. It sounds like something they made up quickly in a meeting to quell us. It's up to corporate how long they want production to be affected.”

There was a pause. We both stared out the window for a few seconds. The street beyond was quiet and hazy.

I lowered my voice. “I opened one of the apps. One that wasn’t listed properly.”

She looked up immediately. “What?”

“It didn’t even have a name, really. Just a file name: Halcyon.app. No info, no icon, well… until yesterday. I made a mistake.” Admitting it out loud. “Everything was flashing and it white screened. My hands froze. It rebooted, but after that… at the end of shift…”

I paused for a moment “I’ve opened it twice now and it doesn’t work. The representative seemed dismissive about it. I’m confident it gave me a migraine.”

Natalie didn’t speak right away. She tapped her fingernail against the ceramic mug in a slow rhythm.

“Yeah, I saw that one too.” She said softly.

I blinked. “You open it?”

She shook her head. “No. I hovered over it for a bit. Thought it was just a bugged out listing.”

I nodded slowly. “Ever since yesterday, I feel terrible. I don’t know. I wanna blame work, but the dreams were intense too.”

That got her attention. “Dreams?”

“Just weird,” I said. “Hard to explain. But I woke up and couldn’t shake the feeling.”

She hesitated, and laughed a little. “Maybe it’s contagious.” She looked back down. “Well you know I've been feeling it too. Like, just a little out of sync. I almost tripped on nothing walking to my car.”

A realization came over me,
”Be honest with me… did you open it?”

Her voice was quieter. “Not really…I might have when I fell asleep. I woke up to a white screen in the headset.”

We both sat with that for a moment. Natalie broke the silence. “Maybe we’re just fried. New software, long hours, heat wave. That’s enough to scramble anyone.”

“Yeah…” I said, though it didn’t feel like enough.

She pulled her legs up into the booth, wrapping her arms around them. “Still… maybe don’t click anything weird for a while. And if you get another dream like that? Tell me. Deal?”

“Deal.” I managed a smile.

We sat like that for a while longer, sipping coffee as the diner lights buzzed above us and the shadows outside deepened. Neither of us said it out loud, but we both knew something had shifted.
We just weren’t sure how much it would affect us, yet.



Part 2.5

I looked at my long messy hair in the mirror.

I tried to get myself in gear but I couldn’t, I wasn’t sure if I was going to be ok to work today. The dreams I had last night, well if you want to call them that. Felt so vivid. The emotions were intense, and I was more drained from sleeping than anything. But I was still moving. Still functioning mostly.

It slapped my face cheeks lightly to get myself together and pushed myself to get to my car. I held my hair tie in my teeth as I sat down and pulled my hair back into a ponytail.

If I’m lucky, maybe they’ll send me home.

I managed to drive to work without incident, though my fingers gripped the wheel a little tighter than usual.

I saw Aren when I walked inside, already busy talking to the yXX representative at the front of the shop. 

Weird, corporate doesn’t normally show up this early.

I guess they wanted her to be readily available for any “user responses” this morning.
The representative had a table set up next to the break room and the orange Hilo barriers. Normally people from the office don’t show up until a few hours after our shift starts. 

A smile flickered on my face, but I didn't have the energy to wave.

When Aren turned around I knew they could see how wrecked I looked.

“Mornin’.” I said, trying not to sound as rough as I felt.

“Hey, Same to you.” Aren said with a smile. 

I was too low on energy to have a meaningful conversation before the buzzer went off, though I was happy with the news that Aren had given me.

I wish I could walk faster

I forced my legs toward my side of the floor, each step louder in my ears than it should’ve been.

I worked in a different part of our shop, with the spot welding division. I suited up: my respirator, kevlar gloves, apron. After, slowly putting on my headset. The nasal wire entered a hole on the top of the respirator, and slid into position. It sent a shiver through me. 

The system blinked to life. A soft whirr on my chest and then a ripple of icons, browser tiles, and a subtle tracking dot that followed my eye movements.

My hands, like clockwork, took over. Grabbing the pincer welding device next to me and starting the conveyor.  

Okay, okay, at least I got all set up. Let’s try to interact with something engaging so I don’t fall asleep.

My legs would lock up if I went unconscious, something that yXX had as a failsafe for emergencies. But your eyes needed to be interacting with the lenses or your body would stop moving. Something about the connections in the brain were very important. If your eyes did stop moving, or they were closed for 5 minutes, a warning would be transmitted to the supervisor.

We’re gonna struggle-bus until break, then I can down some energy.

My thoughts were in a fog.

I opened the app browser, and gazed around. Hovering over a listing with no icon.

OK, what are you?

My eyes were so heavy.  I felt like my vision was pulsing, my mind slipping sideways.

The world fell away, I was in a space so vast it defied logic. The sky above wasn’t sky at all, but a canopy of brass. Riddled with blinking red lights that beat like hearts.

Then a sound. Like metal screaming.

My body jolted, my mind reeling.

What the hell?

I shook it off, I must have nodded off for a second. I checked the time in the corner of the display.

2 hours had passed.

Uh????

Why hadn’t a supervisor come over? I mean, maybe I got lucky and something errored with the new headset and never sent over an alarm to my boss.

Something even more jarring had also occurred, my part counter had increased. 

This, this shouldn’t be possible.

I looked at the time again. Break is in 15.


Chapter 3

The next day

Walking into work, apprehension filled my gut. I looked over near the break room. The yXX rep was already sitting at her makeshift desk, bright eyed and stiff spined at 5AM like she never left the building.I shook my head and sat at the bench next to my locker until Natalie arrived. When she walked in she looked relieved to see me.

I pointed subtly across the shop

“Nat, look who is here bright and early again.”

Nat grimaced. “I know it’s like she sleeps under the desk.”

“Hopefully getting OT”

I stood, took a breath, and walked over to the rep’s table like a kid about to get scolded for sneaking out past curfew.

“Aren I did hear you are one of the employees that had a calibration issue. Rest assured we are doing our best to make sure that does not happen again.”

Without looking down she picked up a form and lifted it towards me.

“All employees that were absent yesterday because of the calibration fatigue will be paid for the hours missed. Just fill out this form.”

“Oh, what? That’s awesome.” I said in surprise, relief blooming in my chest.

I thought for a moment and asked “Does the same issue also cause strange dreams?”

She blinked twice. “Symptoms like that have not been documented. Let me make a note for the engineers.” She grabbed a clipboard and scrawled on a sheet quickly. “We will follow up about this.”

“Thanks” 

The buzzer went off, and we split off and the rest of the day passed quietly. Uneventful, but foggy. I scrolled past Halcyon, hovering near it, but careful not to open it. My curiosity tugged at me. 

What was it for?

——————————————-

At the end of the shift, towards the front of the shop. I looked up the high factory walls, staring at the windows perched up at the top. They were meant to let in some sense of afternoon light. However, black dust covered them. 

I’d looked at those windows hundreds of times. But in the moment, something about them gave me a sinking feeling. It made me feel like we were sealed off from the rest of the world. The factory was just a large metal box holding us all inside together.

Natalie’s voice caught my attention. “They’re paying you for being off?” She asked as we both moved towards the lockers. “That’s strange. But I’m sure you’re not complaining about it.”

“Not. At. All.” I said.  “Well, besides the migraine I had to endure.”

“It’s just weird, stuff like that should have been caught with the beta group. I know I was excited about the update at first. But now.” She said worriedly. “Isn’t it strange they still have that app listed that doesn’t work?”


She opened her locker and stared inside like she was looking for something she had forgotten. Neither of us said anything more, as we packed up in silence.


———————————————————————-

The hot air was stale. Faintly metallic, like hot circuits. As soon as I got home my body wanted to crash from the summer heat. I shut the door behind sealing the oven behind me. Inside, the hum of the air conditioner treated me with a dull whisper.  

I looked at the calendar as I walked in.

Great, only a whole more month of this crap.

It was the end of July and I was none too pleased about it.

I sat on my couch and cooled off. I tried my best to enjoy the A/C. I spread out like I was trying to become a part of the cushions. The cool air brushed over my skin, but didn’t reach the inside of me where my unease lied. I was beat, but I didn’t want to sleep. 

I didn’t want to have another stressful dream.

I scrolled through my phone, the light of the screen reflecting in my eyes as my fingers moved slower and slower. My body betraying me. Scrolling, my eyes got heavier and I slowly melted onto the couch.

Somewhere between a blink I faded.

I was floating in a black space, too big to understand. Cold and full of an oil-like substance. I saw two massive gears at the center of a galaxy. The solar system, not as it is now but as a machine. Hurling through an oily cosmos with the power of an infinitely unwinding spring.

The universe wasn’t alive, but built.

And I was too small to belong here.

I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. I felt watched. Not by something evil…but something that had already disassembled me and put me back wrong. My body became covered in a tangle of warm wires, all twisted around me. In a strange way I felt. Safe. 

Safe, in the way a tool feels safe in a box.

I woke up gasping, tangled around my unplugged charging cord like a web.  The room was dim and quiet but not completely silent. The kind of quiet that you only notice after a machine powers down.

I blinked at the ceiling, trying to shake the dream loose. 

But it stuck.

The vision of the spring. The turning gears. It felt too specific, too constructed. Had I seen it somewhere before?

A movie?

A comic?

Some obscure Sci-fi blog post I half read?

I couldn’t tell anymore. I’d consumed so much media at work that my dreams felt secondhand now. 

Still unsettled, I reached for my tablet and opened a browser. Just typing in a few vague terms trying to follow the thread. 

Like:
Galaxy made of machine unwinding spring

The first few results were nonsense to me. Something about an aftermarket vehicle part. “Galaxy 380 spring tensioner” Whatever that was.

One link caught my eye and made me laugh.

Some fringe article about a crackpot religion of a broken god. Crude page, and bad layout. “Unity through disassembly. Perfection through purpose.”

I searched for a few more minutes. But I couldn't find anything online about a movie or a game that had the same description.

I pressed the power button to shut off the screen and rubbed my eyes.

Weird dream.

I told myself. But nothing more.

1pjjsdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pjjsdj/mr_js_workshop_part_2/,Mr J.’s Workshop (part 2),"I’ve had a rough week. 

Coffee was once my best friend, but now he’s been set aside for my lover; cigarettes. Originally, I only smoked once or twice every few days. Just something to help me relax on breaks. Now packs that used to last me a week only last the weekend.

The past week has definitely shaved a few years off my life, but that seems to be an occupational hazard. Just instead of one week removing a year, it now removes two or three. 

Perhaps the nicotine flowing through my veins will deter some pesky late night patients. A small silver lining. I’ve been trying to appreciate them lately.

My troubles began on Monday morning. 

As I laid peacefully in bed - dreaming of finally discovering a mute button for Janet - I was awakened by an incessant buzzing. In a daze, I groaned, presuming it was my alarm announcing another day of work ahead of me. 

I waved my hand about in the dark aimlessly for a couple minutes, praying I’d find the source of the buzzing. While a light source would’ve been a much more effective search method, opening my curtains required movement. My bed was just too comfortable. 

Finally, with my phone in hand, I squinted at the screen. Since when was it so blurry?

I’d rather not admit how long it took me to remember I needed my glasses. I will admit however I’d fallen asleep with them on my head. I promptly pulled them down. 

While rubbing my eyes, I noticed the time read 4am. 

4am? I don’t need to be in until 6am. Did I set my alarm wrong? 

Somewhere in the back of my brain, my gears finally started to turn. My alarm didn’t sound like this. Wait a minute…

It was a phone call from one of our regulars. 

Still half-asleep, I yawned and picked up.  

“Hey Stacy, what’s up?” I smacked my lips a bit as I spoke. 

“It’s coming now, Dr. Morrigan! Right now!” 

A thick southern accent came from the other side. Despite the desperation in her voice, it didn’t register with me at the time. 

“Huh, what’s coming? Who?” 

“The baby!” 

“The wh-”

Everything then clicked for me. I could hear her pained breaths coming through the screen. I jumped out of bed, keeping the phone pressed to my ear with my shoulder. 

“Shit! Right, sorry Stacy!” 

I ran around my room picking up various socks and underwear from my bedroom floor, trying to determine which were still clean enough to wear. A quick sniff sufficed.

“Shit. Dammit it. We don’t even have anything ready yet.”

I hopped around on one foot while trying to pull up my pants. Unintentionally attacking my furniture in the process. A chair there, a lamp over here, a painting on the ground there. I’m quite impressed by the damage I was capable of in the span of 30 seconds. 

“Oh come on.” I muttered. “Uh- Right. Stacy, head to the workshop. I’ll try to get a hold of Janet and Larry. I’m on my way right now!” 

My arm chair was now on its side.

“Ok Doctor, I-“

Stacy’s response was cut off by a laboured groan. As it came through, there was a sudden electrical spark from my phone. 

“Ow! Shit!” 

My phone was already on the floor before I even realised I dropped it. I shook my hand in pain. 

“Dammit, man. Stacy, are you still there?”

I reached for my phone, just to realise she’d already hung up. 

“Fucking of course, I-“ 

While turning to run out the door, my foot was suddenly met with the metallic pole of my lampshade that had found refuge on the floor from my rampage. I felt a hot surge of pain travel from my big toe up my leg.

“Ow! Fuck! Oh come on!”

I limped the rest of the way out of my apartment. 

Stacy was one of our regulars. Last I’d checked in on her, she was 34 weeks pregnant. It seems her baby was determined to enter the world however, unsurprising from the spawn of an eldritch horror. 

While premature births were fairly routine, there was one slight problem. 

Stacy is four stories tall. 

When providing her prenatal care in the past, we had to hide her under a large circus tent out back. While it wouldn’t have been impossible to fit her in the workshop, it would’ve been a tight squeeze. 

I was unsure of what to anticipate from this birth. While Stacy wasn’t the first Lovecraftian horror I had helped to bring offspring into the world, I had never been informed as to what kind of damage she could do. Or the baby. 

I had no idea what we’d signed up for. 

When I arrived, Stacy was already waiting outside under the tent. As I approached, I could see her clutch her stomach in pain. Each of her breaths were sharp. With each breath, I’d be pulled closer or pushed back by a small gust of wind she created. The warm air against my face made my skin crawl. 

“Stacy!” I called out to her. 

“Oh doctor, you are finally here!’’

Large, green and slimy, I’d never encountered a species like her before. Despite her feminine demeanor, I always couldn't help but gawk at her masculine body. She was built like a Greek statue. At the top of this body sat a large head, with tentacles for hair and a large beak. A peculiar yet mesmerising sight.

Even now I couldn’t help but marvel at the size of her. 

“Uh- can the father not make it?” I looked around, as if somehow I could miss another giant being hiding under a bright red and blue circus tent. 

“Oh, there is no father.” 

Now that I thought about it, she always came to her appointments alone. I tutted, what kind of scum would leave such a sweet lady to raise a baby alone? 

“Ah sorry to hear. He’s missing out on a beautiful moment.” I flipped through her medical file which I somehow remembered to bring with me. 

“Oh no, no, sorry. You misunderstood. There is no father.” 

This time she slightly nodded her head at me to emphasize each word. I began to catch on to what she was implying.  

“Oh.” 

It was too early for this shit, I don’t even want to know. 

While taking note of this divine intervention baby, I heard the slam of a car door behind me. To my relief, Larry had just exited his car and was now sprinting towards me. His barbels swung in the air behind him. 

Now that I think of it, Larry drives himself to work… how the fuck has he not been pulled over before? 

I set the thought to the side. Right, more important things going on right now Alice. 

“Larry! Quickly, open the shutters!”

Without hesitation, he gave me a thumbs up and pivoted his foot to change his direction towards the large red shutter door. It was once used for delivery trucks, now it was going to aid us in a new kind of delivery. 

While Larry got to work, a honda civic came skidding down the alleyway. In a flash, it went flying out of sight, followed by a;

SCREEEEECH!

And the sound of clattering metal. Janet emerged from around the corner, struggling to run in her red heels and pencil skirt. I turned away, pretending not to witness her tripping over a sleeping alley cat, and ignored the sound of it hissing behind me. 

“Janet, I need all the towels we’ve got!” 

She stopped in her tracks. I didn’t need to turn to see her eye roll, I could hear it from a mile away. I began to time Stacy’s contractions while hearing the workshop door be slammed shut in the distance. 

“Don’t worry Stacy, we are here now. We’ll get you sorted.” I said, still staring at my watch. 

“I know, Doctor.” She began between laboured breaths. “I’m in the best ha-“

Instead of finishing the sentence, she opted to scream in pain. 

For a moment, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me and tapped my legs to make them stop shaking. However, out of the corner of my eye I saw Larry moving up and down, struggling to stay on his feet and keep his grip on the shutter button.

Stacy screamed again, even louder. This time I could feel the movement under my feet, when I looked down I saw small pebbles bouncing in mid air. 

I heard someone approaching behind me.

“No, no, no!” 

I whipped around. Janet was struggling to balance the tower of towels she’d amassed. The pile could’ve reached the roof inside. I now wish I could've seen how she managed to get them through the door. 

As the tremors got more aggressive, the tower wobbled before collapsing completely. 

“Oh come on! Seriously?!” she protested as if her frustrations could change the course of events.

Janet watched helplessly as they all fell to the ground. Once Stacy’s screaming ceased, Janet scrambled to pick them up. 

“Janet, I need those inside!” 

“Oh fuck you Alice!” She flipped me off while still re-gathering her colourful assortment of towels. 

“I’m so sorry Doctor I-“ I could hear Stacy’s embarrassment and I was having none of it. 

“Just keep breathing Stacy! It’s fine!”

It was not fine. 

When the second round of the mini earthquake began, I could’ve sworn I saw something green sparkling at the bottom of the alleyway. I took my eyes off Janet’s struggles and to my surprise, I could see a rounded elongated sphere. Inside it there were glimpses of a reality like our own but warped. 

It disappeared when the earthquake stopped. 

Of course she can open portals to other dimensions. Why would my job ever be easy? 

To top it all off, I had to pray these on and off again earthquakes wouldn’t alert any local authorities. They were fairly common but not at this kind of frequency. Perhaps I could say the earthquake was just being a little shy and building itself up? Nothing to see here?

We were so fucked. 

It felt like a decade had gone by waiting for the shutter door to open. Once it finally was, I spared no time to express relief.  Instead I began pushing all of our ‘rooms’ to the side. Despite him not knowing the details of my plan, Larry began to copy me. 

“Stacy, try shuffling your lower half inside!” 

All our equipment was inside and it was a lot cleaner. There was also a highway not far from the factory and the tent was taller than it was long. I couldn’t risk anyone spotting her. This was the quickest solution I could think of without having to completely cramp her into the building. 

“R-right, I’ll try doctor.” 

Stacy began to slide inside, making sure to leave the tent over her head as she did. While she got into a comfortable position, I worked quickly to slide the ultrasound over to her. As I was about to place it on her stomach, I looked at the size of it then compared it to her. 

“Larry! Where’s our bigger ultrasound?!” 

Spinning on one foot, he scanned around the entire shop floor. After failing to spot anything, he shrugged. 

“Oh for fuck sak- Just grab the fetal monitor.” 

I wanted to make sure there were no complications with the baby coming so soon, I’d have to settle for monitoring the heart rate instead.

Like a loyal soldier, Larry obeyed my commands without delay and before I knew it what I had requested was beside me. We had a larger fetal monitor made for a past patient, so size was no issue this time. 

Larry climbed up to tape it along her stomach while I began to take notes of the baby’s heart rate. Everything appeared to be normal. Stacy’s contractions also appeared to be fine with no abnormalities. 

Perhaps this wouldn’t be too complicated after all.

“Do we have a blood cuff that will fit?” I asked Larry, who was kneeling over in front of me, exhausted by his mountaineering. 

With his two hands, he did a snapping branch motion. 

“Broken, really? Wait-  Yeah, you’re right I was meant to ask Mr J. for a new one. How are we going to keep track of her blood pressure then?”

Stacy began to scream again.

“I have a suspicion it's high!”

The building began to tremble. One by one, the lights on the roof began to come crashing down, causing electrical sparks as they did. 

A single spark managed to reach one of the curtains setting it alight. Desperate, I tried to search for something to put it out. The coupling gel for the ultrasound? Bad idea. A chair? That makes no sense. My foot? That could work. 

Before I had even settled on my method, Larry was already over frantically jumping up and down on the flame. While at first I was going to thank him, I then watched him drop to the floor and start rolling over it, his body vibrating from the tremors as he did. 

“No. Larry, stop, drop and roll, is for when *you're* on fire!” 

Fortunately, the flame had already been extinguished by his initial stomps. I judged him a little as he struggled to rise to his feet. 

For a surgeon, he's always quick to panic…

Outside the shutter door, something caught my eye. Another green portal appeared, consuming Stacy’s tent before evaporating with her screams. When I turned back to look at Larry, I realised he was looking right back at me, both attempting to confirm we weren’t going crazy. 

I couldn’t focus on any of my thoughts over Stacy’s loud breathing. That’s when I remembered it was Stacy I should be focusing on. 

I gestured to Larry to go to the storage closet. 

“Get some Diamorphine, also grab a mattress to give the baby something to land on.” 

He nodded and ran off. 

“Diamorphine? Isn’t that a pain killer doctor?” Stacy bellowed down to me. 

“Well… yeah?” I replied, I knew what she was about to say next. 

“Thank you doctor, but I don’t want it! I want it to be an all natural birth!” 

Fuck. 

Under normal circumstances, I’d say to each their own. But at this rate the building was going to collapse in on us. 

“Are you sure?! No pain killers at all?!”

“I’m sure!”

“Not even a TENS machine?”

“Woo, woo, no! I- I don’t want anything like that doctor!”

“Oh I think you do.”

“I uh- I don’t?”

“Well I think I want you to think you do.“

“Why? Is it a medically necessary doctor?”

“I mean… no but-“ 

“Then I’ll pass. Our ancestors did it for generations without pain killers. I'm sure I’ll manage!”

“Dammit, Stacy, you’re going to get us all killed!” 

I heard my voice echo throughout the workshop floor. There was a beat of silence. 

“Oh… I’m sorry doctor, I thought you said it was fine…” I couldn’t see her face but I could feel her disappointment. 

“Uh- I mean- Yeah! Everything's fine… I just meant you were uh- You’re going to kill us emotionally! Watching you in pain like this!” My voice cracked a few times as I internally screamed; ‘ALICE, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?’

“Aw, thank you so much for the concern doctor! I’ll be just fine.” I could hear her smile from all the way down at her feet. Even while in pain she smiled so brightly. 

I hope my expression was less obvious from my voice. I could feel my eyes about to pop out of my skull, staring at the ground in disbelief at my choices. I had chosen suicide over social suicide. What a bargain. 

Damn Stacy, she’s too sweet even for my heart. 

I refocused on the task at hand to distract me from my past decisions. Larry could be informed when he returned. Stacy was now 10 metres dilated, ready to start pushing. Before I could give this direction however, I encountered a problem. 

Have you ever seen those videos where people crush watermelons with their thighs? Yeah, this was a much less sexy version of that. 

The baby’s head was starting to become visible, but while her cervix was a wide enough canal for the baby to fit through, I noticed Stacy’s thighs were putting too much pressure on it. I heard the odd crack, which I could only presume was its skull. 

I looked up at Stacy’s legs, they were far too close together. A consequence of being cramped inside. 

“Stacy, I need you to spread your legs wider!” 

She didn’t respond, too focused on the pain. Despite this, she followed my directive. To my dismay however, her legs couldn’t spread much further, now touching the walls with her knees. This hadn’t resolved the problem. 

Dammit, what do I do? I could maybe flip her around, have her bottom half outside. But she was huge, turning wasn't going to be easy. 

Now with the clock clicking closer to 5am, the highway was likely to start gaining some early birds. With the tent gone, her standing up outside would be a real risk. 

As I was attempting to come up with some plan, I realised Janet was inching closer, laying out her towels which now stretched from the shutter to Stacy’s hip. 

I tried to ignore her, but immediately became distracted as I saw her smudge her lipstick and stop everything to fix it. She set the remaining towels to the side and pulled out a stick to fix her mistake.

“Does this really seem like the time Janet?!” 

“You focus on your job, I’ll focus on mine.” 

“That’s my problem! Stopping being a vain cow and get back to work!”

“Excuse me?!”

Suddenly, Janet’s heels weren’t an issue anymore as she rapidly approached me. I stood firm, ready to face her. But before it went any further, Larry had returned and put up his hands, getting between us. 

I was so distracted by our back and forth, I hadn’t noticed Larry had already retrieved a mattress and laid it in front of Stacy’s legs. 

I began to gesture for Larry to follow me.

“Right, right, you’re right Larry. Sorry. We also have a problem I-“ 

“No, we aren’t done here. You need to learn you are not my boss!”

I turned, ready to tell Janet to kindly fuck off, but was instead surprised to see her turn deathly pale. I followed her line of gaze, and realised she saw what was between Stacy’s legs. She promptly fainted. 

“Oh for the love of- Larry, make sure she didn’t hit her head too badly.”

Larry’s head flopped about in a manic state, from me to Janet, to Stacy, then back to me. I grabbed him by the shoulders and began shaking him. 

“Hey, hey! It’s just you and me now. We’ve got this. It’s just one baby, how bad can it be?” 

If he could still sweat, Larry would’ve flooded us. I then saw a light behind his eyes, a momentary hope. Proudly, he raised the diamorphine he’d retrieved on his mission. 

My expression must’ve given it away, as I watched that light slowly flicker out. As I relayed the news to him, his hands dropped to his side in dismay. In the process, he almost dropped the pain killers but I quickly snatched them. 

For a moment, I considered using them on myself, then set them to the side. 

I then looked Larry in the eye and shook his hand. 

“No matter what happens Larry, it was a pleasure working with you.” 

With his spare hand, he gave me a small salute. 

“Now, then. I’ve encountered a problem.” I gestured to the baby struggling to crown, “But I think I have a solution.”

This wasn’t the most conventional plan, but this also wasn’t the most conventional birth. 

While the walls of the workshop were getting in Stacy’s way, the windows wouldn’t. 

To allow a little extra light onto the shop floor, there were small windows outlining where the walls met the ceiling. All we had to do was help Stacy get her legs through there. They’d only allow for apart of her knees to slightly poke out, but I hoped it would be enough.

With some of the windows now smashed, Larry managed to secure his ladder for the remaining ones on the left. Ascending to the top, he prepared his trusty hammer. Once at the top of the ladder however, he struggled to stay balanced, having to give up his smashing companion to avoid falling himself. 

When I saw the hammer hit the floor, I sprinted towards it. Before I reached it, I noticed Larry moving above. He stretched out his hand, indicating for me to stop. 

I didn’t have time to question him, as he was already winding up his elbow. 

In one swift motion he smashed through a window pane. Then another. And another. Shards plummeting to the floor. 

I had no time to protest his methods. 

“Stacy honey, do me a favour again and raise your legs up to the sky.” 

Without question, probably too disoriented to pry, she raised them up. 

“Good, good, now just follow my directions ok? Stretch them out a bit further. Slowly.” 

Again she followed my orders. Even despite the circumstances, Stacy was always an angel.

I paid close attention to her knees, making sure they were going where they needed to be. Her left knee edged closer and closer to Larry, while the other mimicked the motion on her other side. 

“Ok, Stacy, good job so far. When you feel Larry tap your knee, stop.” 

I think I felt her nod, as dust came loose from the ceiling. 

Larry tapped her knee repeatedly, stopping her right in front of his face. 

“Great! Now he’ll direct you up, do the same motion with the other knee.” 

The key was to not scratch Stacy’s knees in the process. The last we needed was a glass shard impaling her. Especially with Larry’s current location, another earthquake could spell his doom.

Gently, Larry guided her leg up above his head. Larry was doing no heavy lifting himself, instead he was just gliding her where she needed to be. 

I held my breath as she made it to the glass panes. I didn’t take my eyes off her boney leg as it traversed its way through the broken shards. Then she stopped. 

They were both through. 

I released my breath, then went back to focusing on the baby. 

My heart dropped when I realised after all that effort, it still wasn’t enough room. 

I was out of ideas. 

Stacy trusted me with this baby. It was my call to bring her inside. Just for half the equipment to be useless and now the lack of space was threatening her infant's life. 

Maybe I could get her to crawl back out? It’d be hard with the state she was in. It was clear that just lifting her knees was a lot of effort for her and the movement may just crush the baby further. Could we somehow bulldoze the walls? There was no time. Dammit.

 I may have just killed her baby. 

My mind raced for a solution. The ground slightly vibrated as she groaned. I saw another flicker of green in the distance. I then had a dumb idea. 

“Hey Stacy, next time you make one of those portals, can you try direct it inside of you?!” 

I could feel Larry’s gaze from the top of the ladder. I averted my eyes, I didn’t need to see his expression to know he thought I was crazy. 

“U-um,I guess I can t-try Doctor!” 

Stacy, a doll as always. 

I could hear the metal clanks of Larry descending the ladder in the distance. I waited, bracing myself for another earthquake. It needed to happen soon, not only for the baby but so Larry couldn’t reach me on time to question me.

It wasn’t long before she wailed again. 

Stacy’s scream alone was enough to make the workshop shake. This was followed by a much larger tremor. I could hear Larry struggling to stay on his ladder, but I was preoccupied. My eyes darted around, waiting for a portal to appear. But it never did. 

Maybe that meant… 

Before I could finish my thought all hell broke loose. 

A black hole opened between Stacy’s legs. With it came a large gust of wind pushing me back. I heard a sharp zipping sound fly by, I looked behind me to see our incision tools from a table nearby, now in the wall. 

“Holy shit!” 

There was no time to think about my close call with death, as the black hole expanded. It began to pull us towards it. 

I grabbed a metal support beam as Larry went flying off his ladder towards the roof. With no other options, he managed to get hold of one of the lights. It was barely hanging on, with only a couple cables now more akin to strings keeping it attached to the roof. 

The entire shop floor erupted into chaos. Papers were blown around scattering in the air. Surgical tables and x-ray machines inched towards the portal, scraping along the ground. The scalpels from before shook violently, becoming looser and looser from the walls. 

Even outside, dirt and debris began to form dust clouds that rapidly swirled towards the portal. Even some pigeons who were attempting to fly by were now being forced inside, struggling to flap against its powerful pull. 

It doubled in size again. 

More went zooming through the air. Beds, curtains, leftover coffee mugs, Janet. Oh shit we forgot about Janet! 

The realisation hit me when I saw Janet begin to lift off the ground. I reached out, grabbing her forearm. I wished there was time to be relieved, but now I had to hold on for dear life with one hand. 

When I looked up, the light that was meant to be Larry’s saving grace was becoming looser. The small threads one by one began to unravel, snapping each time they completely whittled down. 

Larry looked down at me with desperation. 

“Just hold on Larry!” 

I didn’t need to remind him. 

My grip was becoming weaker and weaker. In other circumstances perhaps I would’ve begun to pray, but all the chaos made it hard to think. 

As I stared at the portal, anticipating my doom, something began to emerge. 

I heard the cries of a child. 

I tried to focus in to confirm my suspicions, but suddenly everything from the portal shot back out with a powerful force. Larry plummeted to the floor, managing to direct his body toward the mattress. 

Not as fortunate, I went blasting through the air. I cradled Janet in an attempt to take the main force of the blow. The impact of my back hitting the wall sent a sharp pain all the way up my spine. 

The pain blurred my vision momentarily. I didn’t think I broke anything but I couldn’t be sure. That’s when I began to regain my focus. 

In front of me, sharing the same mattress as Larry, was a green baby with tentacles, flailing its limbs. 

“She actually did it…” I couldn’t help but say aloud.

The infant bore a striking resemblance to its mother. While small in comparison, it was still the size of an SUV. As it cried, I could feel small tremors under my feet. Now looking at the size of its large cranium, I suspected we’d have encountered the same issues even if outside. 

The tentacles of its hair reached out attempting to grab everything around it, swiping Larry off the mattress in the process. He lay face down on the floor. 

The black hole had long since been closed. Everything for a moment laid still. 

Stacy reached down with one hand for her baby. Cradling it in her arms, she rocked it side to side struggling to look down at it in the cramped space.

“There you are my sweet little angel…” she gushed over her infant. 

The baby softly cooed as it reached out to her. Stretching out her hand, she let it grab one of her fingers. Its hands were so tiny compared to hers. 

I felt a smile begin to creep up in my face. Was this what motherhood looked like? 

This sweet moment was promptly cut off as fear struck me. Another portal had opened up behind Stacy.

“Oh not again!” I braced myself. 

To my surprise, everything continued to lay where it was. Unsure of what I’d find, I raised my head to glance back in their direction. 

Stacy flipped her large body around and began to crawl toward the interdimensional portal. On the other side of it, I could see thousands of intricate solar systems. Fantastic pinks, purples and blues lit up the shop floor. 

“Thank you for all the help doctor!” With each of her movements the walls began to quake. 

“Wait! Stacy, I need to-!” 

Right before she entered the portal, she took her newborn in one hand and brought it to her beak. In a blink of an eye, she swallowed it whole.

I sat dumbfounded. 

There was no crunch, no gulp, not even a squelch as it slid down her throat. Only a loud burp from Stacy, followed by a quick apology excusing herself. 

“…need to.. examine the baby…” The sentiment felt pointless now.

“See you again in 9 months!” She sang. 

I watched, contemplating my life, as she crawled out of view. Once she was out of sight, the portal vanished. 

The pigeons cooed, strutting and pecking at the ground. Chairs, equipment and curtains were a jumbled mess across the floor. Some paper had made it outside the shutter door from the blast. The outdoors also made it indoors, as dirt covered the entire floor. Some of it landed on Janet’s towels so there was a small win.

I looked around me. Analysing the aftermath of a seemingly pointless endeavour, wondering if it could get any worse. 

As if on cue, I began to feel Janet squirm about. When I lowered my head I met her gaze. I could tell she wasn’t fully awake yet by how she squinted her eyes. 

She had been utterly useless throughout this whole process. Maybe that’s why she was reserved to just being a receptionist. 

I witnessed the slow realisation dawn in her eyes that I was holding her. Without missing a beat, she jumped to her feet, disgusted. 

“What on earth do you think you are doing?!” She screeched, causing my ears to ring. 

It must’ve been a rhetorical question as she gave me no time to answer. After quickly dusting herself off, she stomped away. I listened as her heels clicked further into the distance. 

“… Yeah Janet, I’m fine… oh yes of course no need to thank me… no, no, don’t bother yourself with cleaning up, I’ll get it sorted.” 

My humour brought me no comfort. I couldn’t help but let out a sigh. 

Tired, I looked over to Larry, still face down on the floor. 

“You good Larry?” 

He responded with a thumbs up, before letting his hand flop back down by his side. 

“Good, good…” 

I sat in the silence of a now confused workshop. 

The door creaked open across from me. A client poked his head inside. Even from a distance I could see his eyes were bloodshot. Clearly he was on something. Every so often he twitched as he stepped inside. 

As he bore witness to the chaos that laid before him, his eyes widened to take it all in. 

“Uh… is this the workshop?” He asked. 

I lit a cigarette. 

For the rest of the day, Janet looked at me like I committed some horrific crime against her bloodline. If she wants to die so badly, next time I’ll just let her. 

I ignored her glares while me and Larry attempted to restore the workshop back to its former glory. While the black hole returned our belongings, most were damaged beyond recognition. 

The light fixtures needed to be replaced. Our ladders were too short to reach so I sent Janet on an errand. She returned with a shorter ladder to add atop our current one. I couldn’t tell if she was being intentionally dense or not.

Mr. J. had to send us a lot of replacement curtains. The poles were all bent out of shape from the force of the final impact. Got some which were a tint more green than they were blue. I’m sure patients will definitely notice and care for the redecorating. 

When I got home that night I received another phone call from Stacy.

“Hey doctor!” 

“Stacy? Is there something wrong?” 

“No, no, I just wanted to schedule my next appointment.”

“Appointment? For what? You ate-“ 

I stopped the sentence from leaving my mouth. Maybe that was culturally insensitive. 

“It’s for my next prenatal check up!” 

“…excuse m?-”

It hit me. She did say she’d be back…

I said nothing. Holding the phone away from my ear, I just stared right ahead of me. Despite my silence she continued talking away, muffled in the background.

“Sorry I thought you had done this before doctor I…”

Whatever her explanation was, it faded out under my internal scream for salvation. I took another cigarette and lit it, tossing the lighter across the room. 

“Uh.. doctor? Hello..? You still there? …. Doctor?” 

I hung up. 

Via text, I told Stacy there was a connection issue and I’d organise our next appointment in the morning. Once she confirmed, ignorant to my poor excuse, I slumped into bed. 

I spend many nights before bed staring at my roof. Something most people do I’m sure. But have you ever gotten really familiar with your ceiling? To the point it’s the only comfort you know day to day?

It becomes the only common thread in your life. The only thing you can rely on being normal. It may change from time to time - with paint and dust - but at least it’s always there. Waiting for you to come home.

I lit one more cigarette. 

I dreaded the week ahead of me. I had no idea, it was only going to get worse. ",1,1765413842.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’m married to a Kurdish man. We met when I was 17.

He’s lovely. Treats me nice. Makes me a coffee every morning and brings it to me in bed - I have to ask 7/10. 

He is the manager of an Italian restaurant and is doing well. He supports me.

We have a daughter who is 6. She loves him but is very much attached to me.

His boss has gave him his Range Rover car and he feels very fancy driving this around.

Parked on our drive next to my rubbish fiat 500 😂 it’s hilarious.

Our house that we RENT is falling apart. The carpet is frayed and is exposing the nail part which has sometimes cut our little girls foot.

I have ADHD and terrible anxiety I struggle a lot. I feel overwhelmed so much.

I take medication (antidepressants and adhd meds) to help me keep on top of the house.

I feel ridiculous posting this as I know so many people will say “your husband is working so you should be dealing with the household” I understand this. But I struggle so much. I want to be a good wife. I want to be a good mother. I take my daughter out all the time and make sure she is socialising and is happy. I then struggle to keep on top of the house work. The clutter gets me so down. I feel like I’m on my own. 

He struggles to make decisions. I struggle also. I want the best for my daughter and I feel like we are both shite examples. 

My daughter feels loved, I know that.

I’m just disappointed.

My husband always says he is the way he is because he grew up with nothing and lived in poverty. I understand and completely appreciate this. But he has lived here for nearly 30 years (in the UK).

He is a lovely person, he really is. I don’t want anyone to think bad of him. I believe he has good intentions but crap direction and doesn’t think about us.

The house could fall apart and I feel like he would be upset about it but do fuck all to correct it.

Right now the pull out sofa is broken. I had to ask him to repair it 4 times.. he did with a nail and a screw.. it lasted a day and is now completely broken. Our daughter is asking why the sofa is broken and why her and her friends can’t pull it out ☹️.

I decorated the Christmas tree. The lights have stopped working and I asked him to please check it. He peered over and nodded “yep don’t work”

Do I just put up with this? What do I do? He’s such a lovely person and I have spoken to him about changing and how him having more of an impact in home development will 

Help us. He will sit and search on Amazon next to me for a sofa (showing me various potential sofa’s) but NEVER order anything.

He loves our daughter. He is a lovely person to anyone that meets him.

1pjjkha,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive_islam/comments/1pjjkha/growing_up_i_admired_people_who_sponsored_orphans/,Growing up I admired people who sponsored orphans. Turns out I could afford it too,"When I was younger, I knew people who sponsored kids from Gaza, from refugee camps and from all over the world. I thought it was really cool.  Like these were people who were actually doing something, not just talking about how sad the situation is.

But I also thought it was expensive. Like something you do when you're established and have extra money.

Then I got my first real job after college (the salary was not great), did the math, and realized… wait, this is actually affordable? Like, less-than-my-phone-bill affordable or eating out affordable? 

So I signed up. Set it to auto-pay monthly so I wouldn't forget. That was years ago and I'm still doing it.

We're watching kids get orphaned in real time. Gaza, Sudan, Yemen and elsewhere.  We see the news, we see the numbers, and it's overwhelming. There's this helplessness of ""what can one person even do?""

Orphan sponsorship is something. It's not going to stop wars or fix systemic issues, but it IS going to keep specific kids in their communities, in school, with a chance at their own future. And that’s honestly why im talking about it, I prefer not to talk about this. But if even one other person gets inspired by this I consider this worthwhile. 

The money keeps kids in school instead of working. That's the main thing. Not just ""feeding a hungry kid"" (though that matters too), but changing the whole trajectory.

For a lot of these families, the choice after losing the father is: kid works to help pay bills, or kid stays in school. Your sponsorship means they can choose school.

But it's more than individual impact. It keeps kids IN their communities. They're not displaced further, not institutionalized, not separated from their culture and language. They stay with their remaining family (usually the mother), in their own environment, building a future there.

It lets them be kids. They get to go to school, play, have a childhood instead of being forced into adult responsibilities at 8 or 10 years old because the family needs income.

It impacts the whole community. There are literal studies on this. Poverty and lack of education correlate with higher crime rates, instability, cycles that repeat across generations. When kids get education and opportunity, they become productive community members instead of desperate ones. They break the cycle instead of passing it on.

One kid staying in school → becomes educated adult → supports their own family → raises their own kids with opportunity → community gets stronger instead of weaker.

That's not abstract. That's how communities rebuild after devastation.

I grew up Muslim but I don't think I really noticed how much the Quran talks about orphans until I started paying attention.

There are so many verses about orphans in Al-Baqarah, An-Nisa, Al-Isra… it's not some side thing. It's presented as core to whether you're actually living Islam or just going through motions.

But it’s also mentioned in the Hadith. The Prophet (saw) himself was an orphan. This isn't an abstract to him. He knew what it meant to lose parents, to need community support, to grow up without a father. Of course orphan care is emphasized.

I'm not claiming this makes me some amazing person. It's automated. I don't think about it month-to-month. I get a yearly update and sometimes we exchange letters, which is… honestly really grounding. Reminds me there's an actual person on the other end of this, with actual dreams and potential.

The impact-to-effort ratio is kind of absurd. 

Small amount from me, automated, barely crosses my mind = kid getting education, staying with their family, building a future in their own community, extreme poverty cycle broken.

You're also usually helping a widow. Most of these kids lost their father, so the mother is raising them alone and struggling financially. 

Your support relieves her burden so she doesn't have to work multiple jobs just to survive or do things she doesn’t want to do for money out of desperation. She can actually parent instead of just scrambling for money.

I think there are probably people like younger-me who admire people who do this but think ""I can't afford that"" or ""that's for people with more money.""

And like… you probably can afford it. Most of us can, if we're honest about where our money goes. It's less than what a lot of us spend on stuff we don't think twice about. 

But do the math on your own, this is a commitment for years on. Like don’t take my word for it, look at your own life. 

Also, if you're Muslim and paying zakaat anyway, this can count toward that (through legit organizations that do proper transfers). So it's not even ""extra"" money, it's just… where your obligatory charity goes.

Right now we're watching communities get destroyed. Kids losing parents, families losing everything, entire generations at risk of growing up in trauma and poverty with no path forward.

Orphan sponsorship doesn't fix the root causes. Think the wars, the displacement, the systemic injustices. But it DOES mean that specific kids get to stay kids, stay in school, stay with their families and communities, and have a shot at building their own futures instead of being trapped in cycles of poverty and desperation.

And when you multiply that across thousands of sponsored kids, you're literally helping communities stay together and rebuild. You're preventing the downstream effects of poverty.  The crime, the instability, the generational trauma that happens when kids have no opportunity and no hope.

This is what the Quran is talking about when it emphasizes orphan care so heavily. It's not charity for charity's sake. It's about maintaining the social fabric, about making sure vulnerable people aren't abandoned, about communities taking care of their own.

This is one of those things the Quran is really clear about. It's not buried in interpretations or debated rulings. It's direct, repeated, emphasized.

If you're trying to figure out what Islam actually prioritizes (vs. what traditional culture emphasizes), look at how much Quran space is dedicated to it. Orphan care takes up a lot of verses.

For people who don't want their own kids:

(This might not apply to you, but it applied to me so I'm mentioning it)

I realized pretty young I didn't want kids of my own. Not conflicted about it, just not interested in marriage or raising children. I might change my mind but I doubt it. 

Over a lifetime, if you sponsor consistently, you might impact 3+ kids total (as some age out and you sponsor new ones). That's actually more than most people have biologically, and you're helping kids who are already here and struggling.

You're not raising them day-to-day (that's not your capacity or desire), but you ARE enabling their futures. And the Quran seems to care a lot more about whether you're helping orphans than whether you personally have biological children.

Multiple orgs offer this. Cost varies by country/region but it's generally affordable (think: cost of a few coffees per month, or a phone bill). But I will mention it might be on average more expensive in your specific country. I know costs definitely differ due to currency and the like.

You can start with one kid. If your income goes up, you can add more.

Set it to auto-pay. You'll get updates (how often varies by org). Some kids send letters. It's not a huge time commitment.

It counts as zakaat if done through proper orgs that do legitimate transfers.

Right now, with everything happening, with kids being orphaned in front of our eyes.  This is something you can actually do. Not just donate once and feel helpless again next week, but sustained support that keeps a kid in their community, in school, building a future.

So if you've been thinking about it but convinced yourself you can't afford it yet you should definitely check. You might be surprised.

This is one of those things the Quran makes really clear actually matters.

Anyway. That's my pitch. Feel free to ask questions or tell me I'm wrong about any of this.

I’m not affiliated with any organizations or work in any way for charity. So I’ll be not recommending any charities or anything of that kind. 

Also I know there are many horrific things going on in Sudan, Gaza and the like, but don’t forget there are kids all over the world that need help. Including older kids, from both genders, from less famous regions/countries.

When I first turned 16 I was not technically dating Thom, he had a girlfriend. Even still when he wasn't at her house or he at hers, he'd be at my house or I at his. I was 16 and already a mistress in not so many words. I was showered with statements of love and affection. He was smooth in tongue, yet in action...well at least he never followed through with joining the military.
I was told on many occasions how he adored me and that he was only with her because she had money and could help him out. 
These were lies. 
He just relished being wanted and desired.
I would learn this in time. I would learn to spot a wolf in sheep's clothing from miles away. Though it would still take years for me to put what was learned into actual practice.

She found out about us and they broke up. Now we were free to begin the once-forbidden love affair. Old habits die hard. 

Shortly after we began our no-longer-forbidden relationship, he was up to his old tricks again. Now preying on the younger, the more naive. 
He had lost his house after his grandparents died, so a friend of his family offered to allow him to move into their basement which would become his home. 
They were a lovely Catholic family in the best sense. Open, loving, and enjoyed Saint Patrick's more than anyone I've ever seen before or since. Honestly the best people I may have ever had the chance to know.

They had a neighbor who had a daughter in high school and she had a best friend, you know because normal high school girls have those. He would talk to them and flirt with them, watch movies over their house constantly. One time even left me in his bed to go over there and be with them.
Really off behavior. 
Anyway, time went on. He was a completely manipulative and narcissistic asshole. I was too blind, naive, and believed to be in love to see any of it.
That summer he moved to Oklahoma, for a job his friend helped him get and to get away from the people here. One of the many people he didn't mind leaving behind, myself. No goodbye, nothing.
Still caring and believing he would be who he wasn't, we continued ""dating."" Dating is in quotes because who knew what he did in his spare time, who cares anymore. 

I went to visit him that Thanksgiving, telling no one just packing a backpack and flying out. We spent the extended weekend together and it seemed wonderful, even with his old habits of ignoring and manipulating.
I decided I would move down and be with him and everything would be a fairy tale after that. 

I went home and informed Alice of where I had been and where I was going. I filled out applications for anywhere in town I could walk to. 
Papa Johns's called, talked to them on the phone and informed them of my distance issues to have an in-person interview. They allowed an over-the-phone interview. I had the job.
Everything was set. 
I drained my account and paid for a bus ticket out west.
One final farewell party is held at the trailer. That, that was a party. TVs were smashed, friends were made, and memories. Almost didn't want to go after that, though I had committed to this. 
The following morning at around 5am Alice takes me to the bus station. It might not have been her, might have been a friend, I really don't remember.

Into the station I go, I give them my ticket and am directed to my greyhound bus.

Still very hung over and exhausted from the events the night before, I climb in and find my seat, attempting to stay as far away from anyone else as possible. Put on my headphones and zone out until Springfield, Missouri.

Have you ever wondered why they call it Missouri? Because it's fucking miserable there. The place is a nightmare.
		Absolute.   Nightmare. 
I moved to Oklahoma at the beginning of December 2007. I don't know if you recall the blizzard that swept the nation? I do. I was in the thick of it.
All the buses were shut down and could go nowhere until the blizzard passed. So I didn't mind staying the first night, or even halfway through the second night. 
So by the time the second evening came the bus station was packed. I had picked out a built-in tile bench and that was my space. One kid, about my age, late teens or so, had stopped by my space and we chatted some. He was some up-and-coming skater being sent out to Vegas or Cali, I don't remember. The story seemed far-fetched and I didn't think much of it. He did give me this awesome DC-brimmed beanie that I loved until I eventually lost it. He claimed it was from the sponsors and he had tons back home, it was no big deal to give this one away.
While we're chatting, this younger boy comes up, 12 at most, a true little shit asshole of a child. He keeps trying to take the hat I've just been given. He tries to take stuff from the other kid I'm talking to. Asking me and the kid for money, asking to use my phone, asking how much money we have. You know, nothing good.
He also keeps going back to these meth head looking possible parents and they start coming and asking the same questions. At this time I make the gut instinct call to get the hell out of there before they steal all of what little I have in my backpack.

I call grandma and tell her my situation and that I've already contacted a taxi company that will take me from Springfield, Missouri to Tulsa, Oklahoma. The price was 300$. She obliges. The money is wired to one of the last standing K-Marts that just so happens to be just down the street.
In the blizzard, I walk to the K-Mart and get the money that has been wired. 

I call the taxi company back and let them know that I'm ready for whoever is willing to accept the mission to Tulsa. They let me know that it will take some time to find someone willing to drive in the weather but they will see that I get there. About 45 minutes later the taxi finally shows up. I pretty much say bye to my newly made friend, who would, unfortunately, be forgotten, and escaped from the prison of the bus terminal to the taxi cab. I give him the address and we start on our way down the highway to Tulsa.

We are the only vehicle on the highway that is not in a ditch or abandon otherwise. We reach Tulsa and find that it has, like the rest of the country hit by this blizzard, become an arctic wasteland. There are icicles the size of tree branches hanging from electrical wires. Transformers are exploding, the blue lights of the exploding transformers are all that light the city. 
Most everywhere is a total blackout, except, to at least my knowledge, the apartment complex that Thom and his roommate Bane live in. 
The taxi driver and I take the wrong exit. We take N. Lewis Ave instead of S. Lewis Ave. We are now on the other side of town and have no idea how to get to where we belong. Remind you this is before GPS was an actual thing, we still used mapquest and actual maps back then.
We finally get to the complex, 300, and some change later. The very nice and sympathetic driver didn't charge me for our getting lost mishap. 
I still gave him an almost 100$ tip just for putting in the effort and being willing to take me 300 miles south of where he most likely lived. I told him to be safe on his trip home and try not to get lost as we did, and he said he'd try his best. 

I go inside, Thom is awake, we hang out and I get some things out of my backpack, what's in there is all I have until the boxes Alice sends arrive, which would take about 5 weeks roughly. 

The next day I make the trek through the snow, fallen trees, downed wires, and telephone polls. There is no knowing what the sidewalk is and what isn't. The sidewalk is also covered in the majority of this debris so I decide walking in the street is safer. There are maybe 2 cars on the road throughout my 2 block hike to Papa Johns's to let them know I've finally gotten here and when can I start.
The manager and one other employee are there because everyone else can't get out of their driveways and make it to work. The manager is amazed that I just walked all the way here after my trip the night before and it's only 11 am. He tells me to take a couple days to relax and I'll start that Monday. He gives me my new shirt and I walk back home.

So now I'm working at Papa Johns's and Thom is working at a pipe company. I am barely making enough to pay rent and my phone bill, so I start looking for work elsewhere. This might be where the bulk of my work experience at random jobs takes an enormous leap. I left Papa Johns and started at the Subway in the shopping center behind Papa Johns. 

This place is really odd. I never saw the owner, he never came in, and I don't even think he ever left his house. I was hired by the store manager, she ran the place and also had never met the owner, only talked to him on the phone. He had a camera set up to watch the line and the register. Sometimes we would move it if one of us was wearing the wrong pants so he wouldn't see, then he would just call and tell us to move the camera back where it was and hang up. 
It was a nice enough job but the trek daily was starting to get old and I was going to start looking for another job. It is completely a job finding another job while still having a job when you have to walk everywhere in a place you know nothing about.

I did meet a friend at the Subway job, he came in almost every day and got a sub for lunch. He worked as a used car salesman down the street at the Ford dealership(not 100% sure it was Ford) . I only knew this because I asked him one day how he always showed up in different cars and he told me. We started talking and then we started going to this diner down the road when I got off work. We would just sit, chat, eat whatever we ordered that evening and most likely drink coffee. He would then take me home, but nothing ever happened no.
He did try and help me buy a car once but that didn't pan out because my dad was going to cosign and ended up yelling at the finance people. Whoops.

So then I left Subway and from there I started doing Door to Door sales for Kirby vacuums. I was a freaking vacuum salesman...
It was the absolute worst. We would all go into the office and talk about the day and what we needed to do, then pile into the van and go off into these different neighborhoods and towns. 
Again I have no clue where I am in relation to my apartment from these places. I don't know how to get back home if something were to happen. It would be dark before we would get back in the van and head back to the office. Now sometimes these trips out and back would take almost an hour, add that to my 45-minute walk home and I'm beat. 
I didn't stay there long.
After that I started working at the Shell Oil and Lube center down Lewis Ave. This is where I met Muttinchops. Muttonchops was a really great guy, a couple years older than me, he had already seen some things and done some stuff at this point. He was better for it I believe though, he cared and wanted the best for people. 
The shop was run by a creepy man in his late 50s. He probably only hired me to look at. I didn't care, look all you want just hand over the paycheck. He would just sit in his office and look out the window down into the shop.
I did the vacuuming, washing windows, and detailing at first. After a little while, Muttinchops would let me help the younger kid with oil filters and occasionally help him with putting in the new oil.
The hardest thing about that job was the amount of trash people let sit in their cars. You would be amazed at some people.
Muttinchop even bought me lunch sometimes and helped me find an actually reliable car.
We went out 2 hours into nowhere once to look at a 93 F-150 extended cab, tan on brown. It was beautiful. He test-drove it and checked something out. It was a deal, 800$ later.
We drove it back to Tulsa. I dropped him off at his house on the other side of town and headed home. 

I roll down the windows, listen to the engine roar, and turn up the radio, which just happens to be playing ""Sweet Home Alabama.""
 Absolute bliss.
I pull into a parking spot by the apartment, and the engine roars for one final moment as I turn off the beast. I go inside still excited as a small child at Christmas who got that shiny new bike. Immediately it's taken away from me. My thunder, my joy, it's all taken. Thom immediately tells me how ridiculous, redneck, and idiotic buying this truck was. Thanks, love you too. 

Sometime later a cop came to my door and asked if I knew of a certain person that just happened to be my upstairs neighbor. At this same time, I had no insurance on my truck and I was certain my tags were bad. I was a worried, barely skating by, now 19-year-old. I told the cop that I think they lived in this section but didn't know where.
Turns out that who the cop was looking for was not just a simple person, but a very sketchy person. The kind of person who loosens the lug nuts on your truck. 
That's exactly what happened.

A couple hours have gone by since the officer knocked on the door. I'm napping in the bedroom and my roommate comes in to let me know someone had been messing with my truck.
""Did you tell them to stop?""
""Yeah after they started messing with my car I went out there and they ran off.""
Thanks, thanks for waiting until they start messing with your shit to care enough to do anything. 
I don't notice anything wrong with it when I first go out there. Think nothing of it. Later that day I have to take Thom somewhere down the street.
Ooooh, my stupid redneck truck is so convenient now isn't it?
Driving down Lewis the rear driver-side tire shoots off the axle and goes flying up the road into oncoming traffic, almost hitting 3 or 4 cars and grazing another one. One guy pulls up to me and starts yelling at me for my tire running away.
Like really? Yes, I love sending tires flying up the road and I totally did this on purpose. 
Cockgobbler.
So now I have to go get my tire and bring it back. Find out that the drum is now completely flattened on one side and the axle is bent. 
We bang it out on the side of the road as much as we can. 
I now get reprimanded because Thom decided to stay up late the night before, which caused him to miss his ride to wherever, which caused me to have to take him wherever which caused the truck to lose its tire at that time. 

I finally get the truck home. I go to CVS, yes...CVS is where I go to escape if I can't go to work. Pretty goddamn sad if you ask me. I'm pretty much best friends with the store manager, who decides he wants to buy my truck and will make monthly payments. This started out alright, then he started telling me he could only pay like 25-50 bucks a month because, no not for rent or shit, cause he was blowing all his money on various fun drugs, which he was normally on, with his kid in the house, when I would go by to try and collect payment. 

One day I got fed up and took the truck back, when I told him I was taking it back he took the battery out of it. So I walked my happy ass 2 blocks to the auto part store and bought the cheapest battery I could for that truck. I carried its heavy ass back up the 2 blocks and put it in the truck, started it with the spare key, and drove it the fuck home. Fuck that 90s hippie wanna-be loser douchebag.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Washington Commanders vs. New York Giants: A Tale of Two Sieves**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

The Washington Commanders (3-10) and New York Giants (2-11) are set to clash in a Week 15 NFC East free-for-all that’s less “Monday Night Football” and more “Monday Afternoon Nap.” With both teams sporting defenses that leak like a sieve left in a monsoon, this game promises to be a statistical free-for-all. Let’s break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the wit of a late-night monologue.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Mathematically Mediocre Matchup

The Giants are 2.5-point favorites (-250 implied probability, per American odds) with a total of 47 points. That means bookmakers expect a low-scoring, defensive struggle—odd, given both teams have allowed **over 1,700 rushing yards** this season. The Commanders’ defense, which ranks fourth-worst in the league, is like a colander that’s been told to “hold your ground.” The Giants’ defense? Second-worst in rushing yards allowed. Together, they’re the NFL’s version of a leaky bucket in a kiddie pool.

Key stat: **Veteran QB Marcus Mariota** (Commanders) is 1-5 in starts this season. Mariota, the “veteran,” has the resume of a man who’s played 10 years in the NFL but the energy of a guy who’s just learned the game. Meanwhile, Giants rookie **Jaxson Dart** is coming off a bye week, which is either a blessing or a curse depending on whether he’s slept or watched 12 hours of *The Office*.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Bye Weeks, and Existential Crises

The Commanders are missing not just their star QB (Jayden Daniels, elbow injury) but also tight end **Zach Ertz**, whose season-ending exit feels like losing your favorite barista to a coffee spill. Mariota, now in his sixth start, has led Washington to a 1-5 record—proof that even a journeyman can’t turn lead into gold if the lead is a 31-0 loss to the Vikings.

The Giants, meanwhile, are banking on Dart, a r

Snack - sourdough crumpets with butter and apricot jam 11/10 (extra butter and jam! no more scrimping here!)

Dessert - A WHOLE HU vanilla crunch and shortbread ofc 8/10 (ngl this was very hard, it felt like a waste as it wasn't as good as it was in my head if that makes sense but so proud I had it as I was going to leave it but this is the start of my fight back!) 

Overnight oats - whole milk, banana!! strawberries 11/10 (I love banana and will be having overnight fuck you ED!) also two crackers with a proper butter portion just to really fuck off the ED! 

  
Not going to lie, today was horrendous, bloody horrendous! But I am not dwelling on it, I can't change what has happened and my actions over the past two weeks but I can change what I do for this next week, so I am going to fight my brain like hell to stay at home and recover. To keep my job and my life going. This evening was really hard with dad. He is obviously not happy after today and is fed up (what is new). This made eating even harder as my anxiety was through the roof. But I pushed myself massively and sat through the discomfort and proved to myself I can do this. Now I just need to do it consistently and for the whole day. 

After the appointment I sort of thought to myself, I might as well give up now because no one trusts me and they are going to readmit me anyways but the I was like NO, stop. I am in control. I have the power to change my life and change what happens next. I have a week. A whole 7 days were I can fight like hell, do the hard work and HOPEFULLY prove to everyone I can and will do this or I can give in and end up right back where I started.

From context clues I suspect be slept with some else the night before our second date. He suggested I come over after his work, but I'm not having a second date at 10pm, so I declined. The next day on our date he told me he watched a movie and got high with a friend the night before. He also at some point on that date mentioned how good the sex is while high. I later came to realise that ""watching a movie"" is for him a lot of times euphemism for sex and also, that he has a lot of history with fwb situations.

For more context, we've met 10 years agony and dated briefly. Since then we were both mostly single, casually seeing other people. We've matched on the apps and chatted, sometimes getting together for a coffee to catch up on life. This time I've decided to give it a proper go for the first time. It's been going well and we've been on many dates.

We've slept together since and after putting all the peaces together, I feel kind of put off from the idea of continuing seeing him. I'm not looking for a casual relationship.",1,1765412745.0,u_Common_Passenger_335,0,1.0,False

1pjjbhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1pjjbhr/personal_questions_and_thoughts/,Personal questions and thoughts,"I've been reading more about Christianity and investigating the Church, and I'm asking myself why I should believe this specific Church is the true one. This will be long, but it's better this way than writing several separate posts. Some of this might sound like a rant, and maybe I'm not being very charitable.

Regarding the Great Apostasy, for example:

>  
With the loss of the gospel, the nations of the earth went into a moral eclipse called the Dark Ages. Apostasy was universal. ""Darkness covereth the earth, and gross darkness the minds of the people, and all flesh has become corrupt before my face."" (D. & C. 112:23.) And this darkness still prevails except among those who have come to a knowledge of the restored gospel.

  
So according to this, the entire world lived in darkness, yet there were still men preaching, baptizing, traveling the whole world and sharing the gospel exactly as Jesus asked in the Bible. And apparently they did it all in vain because they supposedly lacked the proper authority to give valid baptism and the gift of the Holy Spirit . So what exactly did the “true Church” accomplish when it appeared in the 1800s? What changed for the world?

When I look at the life of the prophet, it raises questions. A lot of teachings are no longer taught. Big doctrines and big claims by apostles are now dismissed with “we don’t know what he meant” or “that was only his opinion.” It doesn’t seem very useful to have a prophet today when no one is willing to give clear, direct revelations like Joseph Smith did. The last major revelations were basically corrections of past mistakes, such as the priesthood ban. For a church this young, there doesn’t seem to be much continuity.

I can open St. Francis de Sales from the 1500s, and even though he lived in a completely different time, his writings still teach a lot to any Christian. Saint Therese of Lisieux, etc..  How many old apostles from this Church can I read in the same way? I don’t mean to be offensive, but General Conference today feels like self-help lectures and everything are based on that today!  The more educated a person, be it a bishop or stake president, the more they seem to talk about the Church itself instead of Christ. Besides the struggle of following Christ, members also have the extra burden of constantly trying to stay in the Church. They talk about “consuming the wrong things online” and “losing your testimony.” A missionary told me once that bearing testimony is how you get a testimony, which sounds like repeating something a thousand times until you believe it.  

About the race issue, I read in *Mormon Doctrine* something very specific:

>“As a result of his rebellion, Cain was cursed… the Lord placed on Cain a mark of dark skin… he became the ancestor of the black race… Kindly see chapters 15 and 16 in *The Way to Perfection* for further light… In brief: because of transgression in the first estate… the Negro cannot receive the priesthood… When Abel has posterity in some future world, then the restrictions will be removed…”

How can someone read this and not see that these were just men being men, rather than prophets with access to God’s will?

In the First Vision God told Joseph Smith not to join any existing church because they were all wrong. Today I hear something different. For example, apologist Jacob Hansen in his debate with Trent Horn said something like: “There’s truth in other churches too; we just have something more to add - come with what you have.” But that doesn’t really match the original claim that every other church was wrong and corrupt.

  
To be honest, the most arrogant Christians I’ve met have been in this Church. I’ve seen missionaries gossip about each other multiple times. I’ve heard members talk negatively about people outside the Church, as if no one else could possibly be good. It often becomes “Look, I did this righteous thing. No one outside the Church can be as good as me!” . Even when talking about charity, the main focus is themselves!  “Helping others is good because it makes you forget your own problems!"" Everything they do is for their own.  I've heard talks about how his coworkers were addicted to coffee or how “I helped this one ""person "" multiple times. Please, read the bible.(Matthew 6:3).



""If they don''t understand you it's because of the devil or it's okay because they did the same with Jesus. ""

Some converts feel inferior for not being born in the Church, so they constantly emphasize how many years they’ve been members. Those who were born in the Church also make sure everyone knows it. While other Christians see themselves as sinners, some Latter-day Saints act as if they are modern versions of Moses with a special relationship with God, like the people of the Old Testament. 

There's a whole lot of effort to keep ""The ""spirit"". Apparently if you are depressed, or anxious his gone. 

>  
Oh, this one is the worst. There's a promise about everything. To get more money you must tithe and go to the temple. It's God promise or something.  Also god can punish you too! This is also a doctrine apparently: Frequently afflictions are imposed as a result of disobedience, and they could be avoided by righteousness. If Zion, for instance, ""observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her,"" the Lord said, ""I will visit her according to all her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence, with plague, with sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire."" (D. & C. 97:26; 101:1-9.)

  
In Sunday School, there was a father (I think he’s an Uber driver) who talked about how he was worried he wouldn’t make enough money. He couldn’t work on Thursday because of temple duties, and he was thinking about skipping the temple, but he “trusted the Lord” and ended up making enough money before Thursday, so it became a happy ending. People reacted by saying things like, “You must give to the Church even when you’re tight on money,” and similar comments putting the church in first place. This made me think about how some people give the little money they have to a Church that doesn’t even need it.

When I talked about this with a missionary, he downplayed the “promise” part and said the guy got money simply because he worked. But I heard the same missionary emphasize the promise idea when teaching a single mother who happily asked if these promises were true. It feels like they’re trained to do that. Like a salesperson: focus on the person’s weaknesses or needs to “sell” something.

For example, I met an investigator who was heavily into the occult. He even did a palm reading, and since we were ""friends"" already, I warned him that this stuff can be spiritually dangerous. I told him that most churches do not allow this kind of thing and that he should ask the bishop what is permissible. And I asked myself why none of the missionaries warned him. Some think you should baptize first because “the Spirit will take care of everything later,” but come on, this guy had pictures of himself doing magic with sigils. That seems a bit more important than coffee. Anyway, he got baptized before me, received the priesthood, and I haven’t seen him in church since.

I don’t even know why I wrote all of this, but I’m really sad that the “true Church” doesn’t feel like the true Church anymore. And it’s not even because of these specific issues - these are just annoyances I’ve observed, things I’d have to tolerate if the Church were actually true. I’m no longer happy about the idea of becoming a member, going to all those meetings, and chasing exaltation.",1,1765412569.0,mormon,2,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Houston Texans vs. Arizona Cardinals: A Tale of Two Teams (One with a Plan, the Other with a Pile of Problems)**

The Houston Texans, riding a five-game winning streak and ranked 9th in the NFL with a **3.4 Football Power Index (FPI)**, are set to host the Arizona Cardinals, who sit a dismal 24th with a **-3.8 FPI**. This Week 15 clash isn’t just a game—it’s a masterclass in contrast. Let’s break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a sports bar bet gone wrong.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Texans Are the Obvious Choice

The betting lines make this as clear as a neon sign at a casino. The Texans are listed at **decimal odds of \~1.18 to 1.20** (implying an **85-87% implied probability of winning**), while the Cardinals hover around **4.7 to 5.25** (a **19-21% chance**). For context, the Cardinals’ odds are about as likely to win as a vegan at a steakhouse championship.

The spread is a **-9.5 to -10.0 for Houston**, meaning bookmakers expect them to win by double digits. The total is set at **42.5 points**, suggesting a high-scoring affair—though given Arizona’s recent performance, “high-scoring” might just mean “Houston’s offense taking a coffee break.”

---

### The News: Texans Thrive, Cardinals Collapse

**Houston’s Highlights**:

* The Texans just **shut down Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs 20-10**, forcing **three turnovers** (including two by rising star Kamari Lassiter). Their defense is playing like a group of over-caffeinated librarians—disciplined, organized, and *very* unimpressed by chaos.
* QB C.J. Stroud is on a historic tear, now the **second Texans QB to pass 10,000 career yards**. His 203-yard, 1-TD performance last week was so efficient, it made a spreadsheet blush.
* Nico Collins just became the Texans’ **fourth all-time leading receiver**, racking up 121 yards in four catches. He’s the team’s version of a Swiss Army knife—if that knife also happened to throw darts at defenders’ weaknesses.

**Arizona’s Lowlights**:

* The Cardinals just got **launched 45-17 by the Rams**, their fi

1pjj5si,https://www.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1pjj5si/nearby_intact_wearing_a_suit/,Nearby. Intact. Wearing a suit.,"Going back to the end of episode one, and the low-ranking member of the USDA talking to Carol. She asks to talk to the President but…

“That individual passed away this evening, unfortunately. Along with quite a few senior members of the United States government. Davis Taffler happened to be nearby and intact. And he was wearing a suit. So…”

Intact. I keep going back to “intact.” It’s a very specific word, alluding to the fact that others nearby aren’t intact.

We now know that around one in ten people died during the mass conversion worldwide, possibly because they were in a situation where seizing up for twenty seconds is not a good thing. People driving cars at speed; passengers on trains that were approaching a low speed corner between cancel sensors but the driver was convulsing with his foot still on the deadman’s pedal so the train derailed; people like Helen that hit their heads on concrete; people hiking in mountains that fell as they were shaking. So the fact that the President and quite a few of the senior cabinet staff died? And the situation was such that people weren’t “intact”?

My money will be on a Vince Gilligan Flashback scene, clock counting down to zero, and a battle to infect the last holdouts involving bodyguards and the military. Possible even involving the nuclear codes and how a nuclear winter was averted by the infected (which would explain the pause to give Carol access to nukes without question). I don't think it will reveal that the Joined can indeed kill if it’s for the good of the collective, but I do think there was a standoff in either the Oval Office or the Pentagon and some already-infected people ended the meeting not as intact as they started.

Here’s how I think it could happen.

The US Government would have been informed of the signal. I’m not sure if other national governments would have picked up on it: someone had to be first and we went from first detection to infection and worldwide Plurbification in fourteen months. There wasn’t any indication that the public knew of the signal via news reporting. Or that any other nation was aware of it either.

Once enough people were infected after that first outbreak, the Joined would have certain knowledge. One such piece of trivia is that \[fast food orders near government facilities spike when there’s some crisis.\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon\_pizza\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_pizza_theory)) The Joined could use this to their advantage. Find one young man that works at one of the pizza locations or coffee shops near the Pentagon and convert him with a kiss from an infected woman. He could then infect the food or drinking straws, converting customers and workers and members of the government and military.

The government would receive odd reports of missing submarines, people on the ISS not performing their experiments after a supply rocket restocked the station’s food and water, disjointed blackouts of information in the chain of command. Without the public being alerted (so it didn‘t raise alarm), the nation would be on high alert. The military would be on alert but they wouldn’t know what exactly was happening. And they wouldn’t know their every move was known by the Joined.

Eventually, someone would be infected that had access to Air Force One or the Situation Room in the White House. Some members of staff would be turned with one pizza party complete with licked soda cups.

An emergency session of Congress is called. Every member of the Federal government is there at short notice. Some are already converted, avoidin’ the disturbin‘ and prepared for some plurbin’.

The President and other members of the Cabinet are surrounded by heavily armed bodyguards. Once it became clear that people were trying to approach the protected people to infect them, with some success (maybe some through infected blood that started flying), it would be a bloodbath.

It‘s around this time the President tries to launch the nukes. Not all the launch locations have been compromised, but the attempt fails. He is turned and is shot by someone not yet turned. Or paranoia is so ramped up that a bodyguard thinks launching nukes is the kind of thing one of these compromised people would do, so an unaltered Premier is offed.

By the end of it all, many members of the Inner Circle were dead. Some of the bodyguards would have shot anyone that seemed all Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers, including other bodyguards. And of all the gathered members of the government, there’s Davis Taffler. Recently converted. Nearby. Intact. Wearing a suit.",21,1765412149.0,pluribustv,14,0.89,False

I just dont want things to be weird if he rejects me and tells our friends as we will likely all hang out after the break a lot.

We have had very casual ""dates."" The first date he didn't even call it a date. He pretended it was going to be a group of us and told me his sister (we are all in a mutual sport together) would contact me with details. He eventually texted me himself and when I said something about paying someone in the group for my ricket, he got super defensive and told me he asked me to go and he was paying. That was red flag number 1. Red flag number 2 was when it was just him and I. It wouldn't have been so weird except it was an hour away. That's a long car ride for a ""date"" you didn't know is a date. 

He's very clingy and hasn't been in a relationship for awhile. I'm starting to see why. The rest of our dates have been coffee and practice for the shared sport. That's it!!!!!! 

Aside from sending me way too many lovey dovey emojis, gifs, and general bs ...he keeps saying he wants to pat my butt and asking if I want butt pats. Say what? Who in their right mind as a grown adult wants a freaking butt patt (we aren't talking passionate spanking here)? 

AIO for being completely weirded out and turned off??? I've already been planning to break it off but I swear this dude just keeps getting weirder and weirder. 

Today he texted, ""Im just being awnry, but my house could be on your way tonight. If you need a hug, kiss, butt pat... I will take care of any request. 😉"" 

That was out of no where. And the icing on the cake:

He sent me an unsolicited, posed butt photo. I haven't respondrd.  Now he's asking ""Will you tell me your honest response when you got the photo last night?

Part of me just want to lay into him and call out all the bs that's weird. But I also don't want to be mean in case he's just strange, idk. 

He also asked me to wear my hair up next time he sees me so he can see my neck. 🤷🏻‍♀️

TLDR: I’ve only gone out with this guy a couple times, nothing serious at all, but he keeps bringing up patting my butt like it’s a normal adult interaction, asked me to wear my hair up so he can see my neck, and even sent me a posed butt pic out of nowhere. Now he wants my “honest reaction” to it.

They’re a small-batch candle company from my very own country of Canada (and the scents are so good Ill even forgive them for being from Ontario) with unique scent collections based on things like tarot cards and classic vinyl. I’ve tried a number of their candles at this point and across the board these candles arrive packaged very well, the jars feel heavy and solid, the labels stay on and look nice, and the scents typically fill a room but don’t cause an asthma attack. Granted, I have relatively small space in which to burn my candles (thank you BC cost of living), so feel free to leave a comment on how the scent throw performs in your mansion if you happen to have one.

With those details out of the way, let’s get into the candles.

**Fails**

Candle Name: Free Fallin’ (Vinyl Collection)

 *Notes: peaches, blood orange, goji berry*

I have only one true fail from this brand and it was unfortunately a fail on two fronts. First, this is the only candle from among my numerous orders that had an actual problem. Unfortunately, this one leaked all over the place in transit and although the label stayed on it did get oil(?) stained and the jar was pretty greasy. Because that was a one-out-of-however-many I wouldn’t even call this a fail if I had liked the scent, but alas dear reader I did not. This one is probably on me rather than being a bad scent as I am not typically the biggest fan of fruity smells and this *very* fruity. The peach is really sweet and it went a little sickly for me in way that was more peach-gummies-left-on-the-dashboard-of-a-hot-car than the fresh, zesty citrus I was hoping for.

**Mid**

Candle Name: Cherry Bomb (Vinyl Collection)

*Notes: black cherry, vanilla, spice*

Fruit notes strike again with this one, but I am a Joan Jett devotee so I had to give it a try. This one is a delicious and dare I say sexy vanilla dressed up in artificial cherry goodness. This is not a natural cherry, this is a bright red slurpee that leaves you with an incandescent tongue for the next 48 hours or cherry kiss chapstick in a squishy pink tube. My favourite thing about this scent is the intriguing combination of sophisticated dark vanilla and spice with the juvenile candy smell of the cherry - it reminds me of being a teenager and dousing myself in a scandalously adult perfume at Sephora then strutting through the mall feeling like a Next Top Model. As yummy as this one is, it can veer toothachingly sweet and I’m not always in the mood for reliving my teenage years so its not a constant burn for me. I should also note for the record that this *is* the candle I burned while cutting my hair with fabric scissors and blasting the Strokes after being Hurt By A Man™ – so take that as you will.

Candle Name: I Walk the Line (Vinyl Collection)

*Notes: spiced honey, tobacco, smoked oud*

I have to be very careful burning this candle because it literally smells like a baked good and has a tendency to make me hungry. It edges right up against my too sweet limit so I have to be in the correct mood for it, but when I am it is *delicious*. This is a thick golden drizzle of that spiced honey over a bowl of rich vanilla ice cream and if you’re a gourmand person you’ll love it. Fair warning: this might be the strongest scent throw I’ve experienced so far from this brand it and the smell sticks around so maybe don’t burn it in your 10x10 shoebox bedroom on pain of never smelling anything else ever again.

Candle Name: The Emperor (Tarot Collection)

*Notes: redwood, cypress, oakmoss*

Forgive me Shywolf for putting this candle in the mid category. I do like this one, it’s a slightly incens-y warm, woodsy scent that suffers from being a little too similar to The Magician (see below). This one lacks the cinnamon note that makes The Magician so memorable, but if that’s a note you really can’t get into then give this one a try.

Candle Name: Sympathy for the Devil (Vinyl Collection)

*Notes: cassia, allspice, hemp seed*

Candle Name: Gold Dust Woman (Vinyl Collection)

*Notes: nag champa, nutmeg, incense*

I’m combining the review for these two candles because they have a similar olfactory profile. These are both warm and spicy with a kind of hippie-head-shop vibe from the nag champa and hemp seed respectively. They’re certainly not identical, Sympathy for the Devil leans a little dustier and spicier, while Gold Dust Woman has more warmth from the nutmeg and incense, but I’d call them (joint smoking) cousins.

 **Immediate Repurchase**

Candle Name: The Hermit (Tarot Collection)

*Notes: leather, tobacco, coffee, ceda*r 

I *love* a cozy, woodsy, winter-appropriate candle scent and the combination of cedar and coffee in this one checks all of those boxes, along with just a hint of complexity coming from the leather note. I find the tobacco very subtle in this one, it just deepens and darkens up the other notes while adding a touch of sweet smokiness. Overall, its cozy, rich, and smells like being curled up with a cup of black coffee in an old, cracked leather armchair in a cedarwood cabin somewhere in the woods. But don’t just take my nose for it – I gifted this one to my boyfriend and he loved it just as much as I did.

Candle Name: Thunder Struck (Vinyl Collection)

*Notes: mint, grass, fields after rain*

This is my favourite candle to light after I’ve vacuumed and changed the sheets because it smells so clean. It’s very fresh and light and the mint is present without going toothpasty. Its doesn’t smell to me like photorealistic grass or cut lawn in any way, its more of an *interpretation* of grass as an idea. I think this is how grass must smell to herbivorous animals because its so refreshing that I kind of want to take a bite out of it.

Candle Name: The Magician (Tarot Collection)

*Notes: cypress, cinnamon, smoky vetiver*

I was concerned about the spice level on this one when I first read the cinnamon note, because I am not typically a fan of the “spiced fall candle” scent profile. But instead of reading pumpkin spice this one comes off like a beautiful, very classy boutique hotel or spa in some gorgeous European city. Picture the kind of place with crisp white sheets, hundred-year-old wooden floors glistening with wax, and a view of cathedral spires through jewel-toned velvet curtains. Its woodsy, incense-y, and makes me feel expensive every time I burn it.

Candle Name: Whole Lotta Love (Vinyl Collection)

*Notes: cannabis, wildflower, ceda*r 

Don’t let the note of cannabis in this one scare you away, this is another crisp, fresh, almost clean-laundry-esque scent. The cannabis note adds a little green earthiness without smelling dank or skunky, and combined with the light airiness of the wildflower it creates a delicious springtime scent. Clean is the word I keep coming back to this one – picture hanging freshly-washed white sheets on a clothesline in a field full of tall dry grasses and smelling the broken stalks of those grasses in combination with the soapy detergent scent of the laundry.

Candle Name: Aurora (Vinyl Collection)

 *Notes: suede, bourbon, tobacco, grit*

I was initially very confused upon reading the note of “grit” in this candle, but one sniff and I got it. This is a gritty, dirty, sexy, very masculine candle scent that does better in the cold months. In the jar I do find the bitter alcoholic note from the bourbon a little strong, but once its burning and the smell is out in the room its not unpleasantly bitter at all. I think the best scent analogy I have for this one is an beat up leather jacket that’s been worn and scuffed up and maybe not washed very often, but in a good way. This one took me a minute to really get into, but it sneakily crept up on my frequent burn list and was one of the first ones I finished last winter.

Candle Name: Death (Tarot Collection)

*Notes: fallen leaves, sandalwood, teakwood*

Not only does my inner emo child (and outer emo adult) rejoice at the fact that this candle has moody black wax, but this is the *ultimate* spooky fall candle. Instead of ultra-sweet pumpkin spice and bright blue September skies, this is a crisp November night that smell of dried leaves, oncoming frost, and just a hint of woodsmoke. It’s gloriously woodsy and the second the days start getting a little shorter and the Halloween decorations begin to come out I am burning this one non-stop. 

That's it for now as I've placed myself on a candle-buying hiatus until I finish burning my current hoard, but let me know which other candles from this brand or others I should try out next :)

So first of all thank you to everyone that helped me, I took your advice and bought a door lock etc. And btw he opened the package by mistake since both our names were on it and saw it but I supposed it was a needed deterrent.

After I made this post, he obviously kept on with his parade, knocked on my door again in the late evening with an excuse, I told him that I was on the phone and made a phone call I swear I could hear his annoyance seep through my door but that did it, I texted him that I was an introvert and preferred to be by myself at home if he had an urgent matter to chat about he's welcome to text me about it, he told me got it no problem or something of the like.

I figured if he tried anything again of the sort I'd move out. So, he didn't dare knocking on my door again but the story doesn't quite end there.

His schedule was without fail 2 days working at home, 3 days at the office. He started started to spend 3-4 days at home 1-2 at the office. It was like he was making his territory doing all he could so I couldn't ""live alone"" basically, but under plausible deniability. It seemed he was getting progressively worn down because as much as he started camping at home, almost the full week there, he wasn't staying up to catch me at 11pm anymore.

But the grand finale happened the day I moved out. And that's truly a cautionary tale to trust your instinct no matter what. His brother (my landlord) came back and texted me he wanted to say hello before I left maybe have coffee together, and I sensed a trap but I thought no need to blame him from his brother's actions etc. I agreed to be polite even though I had this bad feeling.

So, I told him I'll meet him and that I'm leaving around 3pm. He showed up at 12.30 and knocked on my door (I had no idea it was him he didn't text me) to say hi, I told him I'm not done packing but I can hurry up and he said he and his brother (the creepy one) are going to meet their 3rd brother for a coffee and that he'll see me later, the creepy one was lurking around and I could sense something was coming.

I felt ""obligated"" to hold my words (now I feel stupid) and waited until 3pm, I was about to leave at 3.10 and they showed up. Then a true FBI interrogatory started.

So the creepy one was not saying a word to me but lurking around and acting ""cool"" making jokes with his brother who started the questioning, he literally verified every single thing I had told the creepy one, such as, the reasons I moved to this city, my hometown, my actual neibourhood, in which city did I meet the single friend I know there, when am I leaving, when am I coming back, what places did I visit so far, if I lived with my parents or alone back home, the list goes on.

I was somewhat shellshocked, then he asked more questions, where does the friend I have here live, I told him I found a new place to stay and so he asked where that is, he also asked if I went to clubs or bars.

It was super weird, it was like he was trying to catch me in a lie by any chance he got and felt entitled to know every single thing I did during my time there, even though I can imagine his creepy brother built a story to hide his actions and make him fight his battles, there is no way that this is normal, so my guess is they're both bizarre individuals.

And, since I got truly annoyed and didn't want to hand over my life details (I went to the library until 11pm basically every night but it's none of their business) so I said, I didn't go to clubs but I went to bars, and then he asked me which ones, I said the student one near my library and one in the center (that ik from holidays last year). 

And I'm still baffled, first he tried to judge me hard because I said I went to 2 bars, and then when I talked of the poetry nights etc at the student bars going on he got hyper annoyed like I was looking down on him. Once again I don't even know this guy.

The best part is that, he told me the creepy brother (who changed his flight btw, he was supposed to leave for holidays the day before his brother came back, but I guess he needed to feel avenged) won't be there until mid January so I'm welcome to rent the room again until then.

I'm sorry but in what world is that normal to ask me to move back (3 times) after this behaviour, I'm just baffled at this point. And all the while the creep was listening not saying a word like he was some kind of covert bully child watching his parent punish his victim, no idea why he felt this saved his pride because from my pov they're both lunatics and it's a final farewell.",7,1765411507.0,badroommates,1,1.0,False

(Apologies in advance for the long post but trying to provide as much context as possible)

I’m at a point where I’m looking for the one to settle with, I met this amazing woman and we had been dating for roughly 3 months, everything was absolutely wonderful, both loving towards one another and open at showing our feelings whilst enjoying our company. Everything was great!

We were open with our past and she told me about her anxiety, also sharing that she had a rough previous 2 long term relationships (one was an alcoholic, the other a bad drug user) I reassured her I wouldn’t cause her any upset like they had done to her before and was here to look after her.

We planned weekends together (including her lovely dog) and would stay over one another’s every so often, whilst still giving one another our own space most of the week. 

I officially asked her out on a night out together about 2 months in, but she declined. (for a reason I can’t remember as I was a bit taken back and just replied with I just wanted to make my intentions clear and she liked that)
It was never brought up again and we carried on like that hadn’t happened and things were the same.

My work sometimes has me away from home so this time I was away for a week, we exchanged messages stating we were missing one another etc. and called eachother a couple of times making plans for when I got back home.
5 days in whilst being away, out of the blue comes a message stating “she wasn’t sure if she was ready for a relationship yet, and wasn’t quite feeling the way she should be about me at this point in and really needed some time and space to think about things” So I agreed to give her that.

Now going from talking every single day to her for 3 months straight, waking up to good morning texts and sleeping to good night texts, to then going to nothing at all from her was so difficult for me as I adore this woman.
I lasted 5 days before I caved and had to message her speaking from my heart about how I truly felt about her and that I would help her in working out whatever was going through her head together and that I wasn’t planning on going anywhere.

She came back appreciative and felt comforted, but still needed space to think etc. so again I give her time and space.

I struggled because I had no idea where I stood or what was going on after my life was suddenly upside down all of a sudden without any notice and she was on my mind all the time. Roughly 5 days later I sent her a warm voice note, just stating there was no expectation or pressure to reply, but purely just wanted to let her know I was thinking about her and that if she needed to know someone cared about her and loved her that this was it, and that I missed her and i’m there if she needed me for anything.

The next day a text comes through: 

“you’re a lovely person, and I’m so glad we met. Unfortunately, my feelings for you aren’t growing in the way they should be. I’ve asked you on many occasions to give me time and space, but your messages have been constant. I know you really care and it really shows, but it has just been too much for me. I think it’s best to leave things here. I hope you can respect my decision x”
 
it’s been 5 days now where I still haven’t replied to that message. It seemed to me that she’d made her decision on us clear as day by the wording at the end, and there was nothing I could say or do to change it, and left nothing really for me to come back to with? (Correct me if I’m wrong?) 

Question is.. now I’ve taken time to sit down and talk with myself and realise I was perhaps selfish for not giving her adequate space, do I reply in way of apologising for that? and state that I was wrong for only thinking with my heart and not my head.. and hope that in time we could meet up for a coffee and a walk and talk about it all together In hopes of reconciling/working it out together?

Or do I accept the fact that’s it.. the end?
Maintaining no further contact/reply as she’s made her decision. whilst holding onto pure hope that absence makes the heart grow fonder for her and as a result maybe there’s a chance I’ll hear from her again now shes got the space she needed?

I treated her with utmost respect, loyalty, kindness, care and affection. I didn’t stray or do anything to upset her. (Probably something she wasn’t used to from prev. Relationships and it scared her perhaps?)

Please help me understand from both a female and male perspective on what I should do going forward and perhaps what’s going on in her mind without getting a reply back from me? as I still adore this woman regardless.",1,1765411462.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I’m on the hunt for someone who’s effortlessly cool, totally chill, and maybe just the right amount of weird.  I’m looking for a connection that feels natural, fun, and maybe a little unpredictable.

I’m the kind of person who jumps into random hobbies with zero hesitation, just to see what sparks joy. One month I’m teaching myself guitar riffs, the next I’m deep into brewing kombucha or trying to master origami (spoiler: my paper cranes look more like paper blobs). I pick things up fast, but I’ll admit I’m prone to getting sidetracked by the next shiny interest that catches my eye. It’s a chaotic process, but it keeps life exciting.

If you’re the kind of person who loves learning random skills, trading playful roasts with a side of affection, or just vibing over something hilariously dumb or niche internet memes, we’d probably get along. Let’s grab a coffee, swap stories about our weirdest hobbies, or just see where the conversation takes us.

*Ain’t no way your dumb ass gonna tell me to journal after the shit you did. Makes me wanna laugh, the irony of it, and the gall to lock access to the business till I write all this stupid shit down.* 

*Hey Pa,*

*Found out these are supposed to be a bit more directed, according to the therapist. But everything else is fair game dickwad, I am gonna write every single page I need for the rest of the week throwing you under the damn bus. Ma is still wailing. Thanks for that, fuck you.*

*Hey Pa,*

*Okay the therapist is telling me they meant directed in the feeling not technically towards you but I can do both. I hate you, namely for the fact you went on to throw yourself in whatever god forsaken hole while also forcing me to do this stupid therapy shit in your will just so Ma and I can make a living. Fuck you, should of taken some of your own advice piece of shit AND my therapist says its okay to be angry so I will keep it direct: fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fucck you, fuck you, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck*\-

*Hey Pa,*

*Welp, now the order is to be more constructive. I got a “lot of anger to put in different directions”, what backwater therapist did you hire for this bull shit? No wonder you killed yourself. Yeah read that again therapist man, sorry but I am doing this for the will or whatever. I just, God it's hard to get over this bull shit. I just wanna get back to work, lemme work man, I know how to make the coffee and I am learning the pastries and all that stuff. Why am I trapped writing shit while waiting for all this stupid stuff to pass by?*

*Hey Pa,*

*My talks have gotten longer. Ma seems to be baking again but for herself. Jacob is still going to the club. I haven’t been to the club in a bit, not a lick of alcohol or pussy. I dunno if that's good or not yet, but everything seems slow. People I talked to kept mentioning how fast things were, the world moving on without their friends or family. I don’t feel that way. I feel like I am trudgin through some tar and my head just broke the surface tryin to get away from you.* 

*Just gettin the store ready to open again, gettin ready to take the reins. When I do take em I am gonna slap em hard, so hard all the bets are gonna be on me. That's the one thing you taught me, hit em hard, no pulling punches, no mule in me, I gotta commit but it won’t be for you. It’ll be for Ma if anyone at all. Thanks, I’m crying now.* 

*Hey Pa,* 

*Two more days. Then I can leave you behind me. I read over your note again. I just wished you bothered to do more than just write it all out on a page. I kinda laughed at it, here you are still trying to guide me on how I can get help myself while you set up your own execution. Was that what it was for? The grand display you think woulda opened my eyes to the truth? To God? To sumthin else? C’mon Pa, don’t be dramatic over my indulgences. I dunno what else to write really.\**

*Hey Pa,* 

*Happy “get on with my life” day, I am gonna take the shop soon. Imma keep going to therapy I think, but it's not gonna be about you anymore. I dunno I hate to say it but I kinda found it helpful, what can I say? I can admit when I am wrong, unlike you. But yeah, I even hired some kids from Miller to help me out. They seem good. Honesty with both of em its like you never left the shop, the girl has your sarcasm and the boy is pent up with fuckin something I don’t wish to uncover. Honestly I felt pressured to hire him cause he seemed desperate, but I have to say he knows his coffee. Plus I get it, sometimes you need work to get the gears goin. Honestl-*

I closed my journal, its leather cover a little worn and still filled with many pages both written and blank. I looked out from my little office to see Clohe tapping her fingers against the register, her eyes wet. I got up, setting the journal back on my desk before walking over with my hands in my pocket. 

“I know we had this conversation,” I hesitated at bringing the subject up again, “are you *sure* you want to come in? Cause, Court stuff can be important.”

“Gotta get money somehow.” Her voice strained on the last syllable. “Plus I feel bad for leaving him on the shift last time… I need to pull my weight.” She muttered the last few words as she straightened out her posture looking to the door. 

I stood nodding at her words, “No…” 

She gave me a swift glance. 

“*No*. Given you are here I say you get a week after today. I should have done this sooner, you aren't fired but today’s the last day you force yourself to work.” I saw Clohe open her mouth, but I interrupted her, “I’ll pay you for your time off, I am willing to accommodate.” I died a little inside at the expense. 

“What about Will?” She asked, concerned. “This is the fifth time he’s arrived late this week! He looks like a zombie!” She slammed her palm against the table. “Plus he brings all of those weird empty bottles. He could be drinking as far as we know!” 

“He cleans the beach. I went with him on one of his trips a couple weeks ago.” I leaned over the counter and rubbed my face.

“Before *his shift*?! I-”

“Clohe. I know he’s your friend and you two have gotten to know each other well since I opened up but he refuses any help. The best we can do is offer our hands when we can and hope he grabs on.” I took a deep breath, lifting myself straight. “Besides, how can you expect yourself to help out when you hurtin too?” 

Before she could answer the kid arrived, his black hair grew out to reach his neck and the bags under the eyes had deepened in color. His skin had also gotten paler and thinner, gaunt, would be the best word I could use to describe him. He was holding one of those strange bottles, which he engraved with strange markings, that or it is a style of bottle unknown to me. Before I could stop him he brushed right by me towards the dumpster, he was probably going to shatter the bottle. It was his little ritual he started, my only proof of evidence is noticing the unique bottles in the dumpster, the bottles were always broken. 

“I’m not worried about him exactly.” Clohe muttered, setting her eyes straight at the door. I raised an eyebrow and looked back at her, “He’s starting to remind me of my brother.” I could see her helplessly tap the counter.

I closed my eyes for a moment before nodding, “I’ll talk to him, but if you are starting to get uncomfortable I suggest you take that break.” I started to walk to the back seeing Will open the door, “Quick talk.” I did a quick nod and stared at him while he took a step back from the door frame. He returned a gaze of his own, it seemed serious but it just came off exhausted given he looked more like a corpse. “Will, I know you came all the way here and I appreciate it but you look like you’re gonna croak over. Do you need the day off or…food?” 

“No, I just need to do it.” Will said as if I knew what the hell that meant. 

“Do what?” 

“The shift…” There was no emotion behind his voice,  I glanced between the door and the alleyway exit to the parking lot. 

“You *sure*? Cause you look like you’re about to collapse.” 

“No, I'm fine. Really I’m good, plus I don’t want Clohe to be left with all the work given recent events.” I’d agree with him, but his eyes didn’t fit the words.

“How about this, you leave-”

“No I-”

“You leave, I will pay for your time, get some rest and food and come back tomorrow.”

“Sir-”

“That allows you to get some rest and then allow Clohe to take som-”

“Noah!” I jumped a little, Will wasn’t the one to yell. 

“Just let me do my shift. I just need today.” We stood there in silence as he made me reconsider. 

“No. Will, you need the day off and either way it’d help me more if one of you are here tomorrow than neither. Clohe said she was fine with taking the shift to-” Will turned around and left out of the alleyway. Not gonna lie I was getting a little angry now, cutting me off sure but not listening at all is a whole other issue. “I expect you to be here tomorrow. I don’t wanna do more paper work so you better be here on time!” I yelled at him before coming back through the door. I saw Clohe leaning up against a wall nearby.

We looked at each other awkwardly, “You said you wanted to pull your weight today.” I said sarcastically while walking back to the store getting ready to open up. She didn’t respond, instead choosing to stand behind the counter readying herself for the day. Which began with the usual rush, but we were able to make it work with Clohe and I switching between the register and making coffee. Eventually the work load would die down and I let her man the ship while I did some finances in the back. The constant reminders that I was trading money for satisfying my morals was clear with the amount of it going to Chloe & Will. At first it was worthwhile given how hard both of them worked, but now that tragedy has struck both of them they were not bangin their buck. Clohe was doing the best by far, so I couldn’t imagine what Will was going through for him to be late for the past week. I had every right to fire him, I was chewing on my pen mulling the idea over in my head. Before I could think it over any longer, my phone brightened up with the name of my brother.

“Hey Noah! How's the big man.” I heard the familiar slurred words of the drunk.

“Jacob.” I held my breath, “Good, what about yourself.” 

“Doing fine, I met this girl.” He giggled a little. “Gonna be goin home with her tomorrow night too but-” I looked at the clock, noticing it was almost 4p.m.

“Why are you calling me?” There was silence. 

“I need some money… I got this crazy story as well. This girl is something special and-”

“No.” I was ready to hang up right then and there.

“Hey, hey, *hey*. I took care of Ma today and I am looking for a job. Can’t I get a lil bit of a break? I gotta edge myself off like you did.” He chuckled while I was juggling my tongue thinking of what to say. “If you want, I can even come work at the cafe. One last day of being me before burning it away.” That made me raise an eyebrow as I leaned over my desk, my brother was an ass but he did have enough sense to keep his word. 

“I’ll let you know by the end of tomorrow.” If Will was late, or gave me any more bullshit without any word as to why, I’d kick him to the curb. “I’ll give you the money. If only because you'd somehow convince Ma to give you some.”

“Heyyyyyy” he paused, “One more night.” I could hear his grin form for a brief moment before dropping it entirely “One more night and I’m done.” 

“One more-” 

“Noah!” I heard Clohe yelp from the front of the store

“Call you back” I hastily ended the call while getting up as I heard Clohe call for me again. I rounded the corner and saw her look between me and the window. It took me a minute to realize that in the fading light of dusk there was a man staring at us across the street. He was wearing a blue jacket and as I saw his face I noticed their eyes were sunken and his skin held tight around his body. It took me a moment to realize it was the man who yelled at Clohe, he kinda reminded me of Will, he looked starved. I could hear Clohe breathing heavily behind me, I turned my head to look at her but as I did she widened her eyes and screamed, running to the back door. 

I lifted my head back to see the man sprinting towards us, his brow furrowed and nose scrunched as a look of determined hatred possessed him. At that moment I jumped the counter and ran, ready to lock the door, only hesitating to see if he’d try entering the store or run to the parking lot out back to chase Chloe. He chose neither, opting to run across the street and jump into the pane of glass at the front of the store crashing and rolling onto the floor behind me. I looked at him as he started to groan while forcing his body upright, his shoulders were slanted at an angle making his arms uneven, making me question if he had a dislocation. Shards of glass stuck out his palms, causing him to bleed all over the floor before attempting to sprint again towards the back of the counter. Without thinking I tackled him against the wall, he yelped as I heard some bone crack in his body. He growled, taking his glass covered palm and rubbing it against my face, scratching it to hell. I screamed in pain as I backed off feeling the sharp pain dissipate as warm fluid leaked down my face. Now I was pissed, but before I could get another lick in I saw Will come from around the corner with a bat. He swung it into the man's chest causing him to curl over and drop onto his knees, my relief was short as I started to wonder why Will was here with a bat. But before I could ask I saw Will wind up the bat again, hitting him across the jaw, his head spun to look at me. For a brief moment I thought Will killed him but as he fell to the ground he started wheezing like a deer that was hit by a car. I brought myself to raise my hand, “Will. I-”, that’s when I saw him lift the bat overhead.",1,1765411401.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Naturally, I assumed the high BP (140's / 90's) every morning was from being overweight and having too much coffee.  Well, after some help from the GLP's the weight is perfect, body comp is good and the BP did fall.  

Interestingly enough, the last month it started to creep up into the 150's and even a few 160' here and there.  Made the appointment and got it checked out today.  I had plotted a graph the last few months as it continued to rise and was feeling some of the symptoms.  

Thank you to this group for the insights.  I weighed the options of the different drugs and spoke with the doc today and ended up choosing Losartan.  

This morning's readings before the visit were 145/95.  Took the first pill at 11 AM and this afternoon seeing mid 120's / mid 70's.  

Thanks to all of you in this group for your wisdom and guidance!

When I try to change and I cut out weed and alcohol I drink two or three cups of coffee and or energy drinks every day. I tell myself it’s healthier than smoking or drinking but then I end up craving to be high or drunk anyways.

I feel like i can’t function without something that makes me ‘better’ in some way.

My dumb ass brain thinks substances relaxes me or motivates but i really just lose all care for the discipline to step outta my comfort zone.

I end up more stressed because of dependency. The thought of needing something to do it like coffee to work or weed to relax and watch a show or play a game or workout just fucks with me.

I do them to be more focused and grounded to my hobbies, or to work, or to be more relaxed. 

It’s all a fucking lie and i just feel like the root of it all is that i cant be alone with my thoughts for too long. 

When i’m sober, i feel shitty about where I’m at in life - in my finances, health, and family. Feel shitty at my lack of integrity and word as a man. Like I let everyone down.

I haven’t smoked weed in a week now and I’m proud of that - but everyday i feel the urge to drink coffee or alcohol. I’ve fucked up and gotten drunk a few times and i feel nothing but regret in the morning and false calmness during. 

Lately it’s been regret while im drunk or high. 
Like next time i’ll be stronger and make the right choice.

I am cutting out unhealthy habits and trying to be better but i just keep on failing and starting over.

When i’m sober, i feel so empty and cannot even muster up the interest or attention span to watch my favorite shows or play my favorite games. 

I want to read more, exercise, learn an instrument, and study harder for my aptitude test. 

I want to be have a clear mind, be fit, eat more, and finally gain weight. 

Most of all i just want to be content with myself.

I really want these things but i hate myself because I cannot even focus hard enough to attain them. 

Everything feels like it’s right in front of me for the taking but that I just cannot grab it.

My mind feels broken and numb to desire. Like I lost the key to that door; I know it’s somewhere in me but I can never stay sober long enough to find it. 

I’m so unhappy with this version of myself and I hate that I’m self destructive

I’d say that I’m stuck this way but FUCK THAT.

I want to show myself who I really am and be a leader and an example for others. I just wanna be happy man.

This is the longest I’ve tried my best in a while and I’m going to keep it going.

I take pre workout and I work out at 4:30am in the morning to 6:30-7am. I do heavy lifting, zone 2 cardio, and sprints reaching zone 5. In the afternoon, I do 45 minutes of cardio, around zone 3 and 4. This routine works very well for me for my fitness goals, which is I need to continue to improve on for work (military). I do this Monday through Friday, rest Saturday, and run Sunday. 

However, I’ve also found that fasting 18 hours, skipping breakfast and eating lunch and dinner (also when I take my vitamins) works best for me. When I don’t eat at night, it hurts my lifts in the morning, which hurts a major goal and requirement for the military. 

This is problematic because, in theory, according to my reading, my preworkout would break my fast, and unfortunately right in the middle of it. The preworkout has given me amazing lifts, and trying to substitute it with black coffee or other supplements like minerals and electrolytes that don’t break fast haven’t itched the same scratch and lifted the same weights.  

My overall goal is to increase my VO2 max to get better at running, which means losing weight and increasing my stamina. 

Is my preworkout truly producing enough insulin to take my body out of ketosis, and prevent my body from burning fat? 

I’ve maintained eating 1700 calories or less, my BMR is around 2000 calories, and I burn around 1000 active calories. I keep losing and gaining the same 10 pounds. I take a multivitamin, fish oil, milk thistle, and testosterone, and I’m in my 20s.

I’m working on a top-down raglan and doing it without a set pattern ( the video I watched just said the ribbing should be divisible by 4 and then when I do the single crochet around it should be divisible by 4 as well. I just divided my starting stitch count into four sections for the front, back, and sleeves, but I’m not totally sure if my shaping looks right.

Here’s what I have so far (pic attached). I’ve been increasing at the four corners each round, but the yoke seems weird, and I’m not sure if that’s normal at this stage or if I’ve miscalculated my stitch distribution.

Frogging this yarn is nightmare tbh.... 

If anyone has experience with freeform raglans, could you take a look and let me know:

• Does this shaping look typical for an early raglan yoke?
• Should I redistribute stitches between the front/back and sleeves?
• Any rules of thumb for getting a good fit when you’re not following a pattern?

Building and nurturing a vibrant online community is a rewarding, yet often demanding, endeavor. From fostering engagement to organizing events and managing administrative tasks, community owners wear many hats. The good news? You don't need a massive budget to run an efficient and thriving community. A wealth of powerful, free tools exists that can significantly streamline your operations, boost member engagement, and help your community flourish.

This guide will walk you through essential free tools that every community admin should consider adding to their toolkit.

# 1. Seamless Communication & Collaboration

Effective communication is the lifeblood of any successful community. These tools ensure your members can connect easily and you can organize effortlessly.

* **Slack / Discord (Free Tiers):** For real-time chat, structured conversations in channels, and quick announcements. Both offer robust free plans perfect for smaller to medium-sized communities to keep members connected and foster discussion.
* **Google Meet / Zoom (Free Tiers):** Essential for hosting virtual events, workshops, Q&A sessions, or even just casual ""coffee break"" meetups. Their free versions allow for group calls, screen sharing, and recording (Zoom's free tier has a time limit, but Google Meet is quite generous).
* **Calendly (Free Basic):** Simplify meeting and event scheduling. No more back-and-forth emails; members can pick a time that works for them directly from your availability.

# 2. Engaging Content & Visuals Made Easy

Captivating visuals and well-presented information are crucial for keeping your community engaged across various platforms.

* **Canva (Free Version):** Design stunning social media graphics, event banners, infographics, and presentation slides without any design experience. Canva's free tier offers a vast library of templates, fonts, and stock photos, making professional-looking content accessible to everyone.
* **Unsplash / Pexels:** Need high-quality, royalty-free images to accompany your posts, newsletters, or website? These platforms offer an extensive collection of stunning photography completely free for commercial and non-commercial use.
* **Loom (Free Basic):** Create quick, shareable video messages or screen recordings to onboard new members, explain complex processes, or provide personal updates. It's incredibly useful for visual learners and adds a personal touch.

# 3. Streamlined Organization & Productivity

Staying organized is key to managing a community without feeling overwhelmed. These tools help you track tasks, manage content, and keep important information accessible.

* **Trello / Asana (Free Tiers):** Perfect for managing your community's content calendar, tracking tasks for events, or organizing administrative checklists. Use boards and cards to visualize workflows, assign tasks, and monitor progress.
* **Notion (Free Personal Plan):** A versatile workspace for everything from creating a community knowledge base (FAQs, rules, resources) to documenting meeting notes and brainstorming ideas. It's incredibly flexible and powerful.
* **Google Drive (15 GB Free Storage):** Store and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations securely. Collaborative features allow multiple admins to work on files simultaneously, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

# 4. Understanding Your Community (Feedback & Analytics)

To grow effectively, you need to understand your members and track your efforts.

* **Google Forms / SurveyMonkey (Free Basic):** Gather valuable feedback from your members, run polls, or collect RSVPs for events. Easy to create and share, these tools provide actionable insights into member preferences and satisfaction.
* **Platform-Native Analytics:** Don't forget the built-in analytics of your primary community platforms (e.g., Facebook Group Insights, Discord Server Insights). These often provide crucial data on member activity, popular content, and growth trends.

# Take Your Community to the Next Level

Leveraging these free tools can dramatically enhance your community management efforts, allowing you to be more efficient, engaging, and organized. They are fantastic starting points for any community owner looking to optimize their operations without breaking the bank.

She wants to drink it.

She wants to roll in it.

She wants to live in it essentially.

I was under the impression that coffee is poisonous to cats so what is this obsession with something that’s supposedly poisonous? I’m not looking for medical advice just kind of asking a question about your thoughts on this behavior.

Keep in kind, this is not a social cat. She’s a rescue that had a lot of aggression issues that they were going to put down but I took her in. Even though she’s gotten a little bit more mellow as an adult, she doesn’t really enjoy interaction with people, but she will suffer through it if I have coffee.

Some info:

She’s a 7 yo, female, Applehead Siamese. 

Wants very limited contact with people (Even though she was hand reared/ bottle fed) 

Was listed as “semi feral” by the rescue. Her littermates on the other hand, were not aggressive and not listed the same way.

I have two other cats, and neither one shows this behavior.

1pjic5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NewNeptuneSaturn/comments/1pjic5j/neptune_goes_direct/,Neptune Goes Direct,"Neptune at the 29th degree of Pisces…in my 7th house

Clarity.

I need a lot more boundaries and time when vetting someone to love. I give my heart away way too easily. (Neptune ruled!)

Just because Cupid shot his arrow doesn’t mean it’s safe to receive it or entertain it.

I know my attractions, and why. Psychodynamics aside, over analyzing can really take the joy out of relating to people. I like who I like. My Eros was shaped the way it was shaped. I don’t need to feel inappropriately guilty about it. I just need to be more discerning and disciplined when it comes to love. Also, the slow burn is my best friend these days. (Not that I have anything cooking lol)

I know what I dream about in a fantasy partner. Man or Woman, I don’t particularly care…although I do prefer women. I don’t know who I’ll end up with, only Maharaji knows.

Each Eros chose someone else over me. 1) She chose an abusive controlling jerk who cheated on his wife and blew up his career stability (because they got caught at work) I don’t think he even intended on leaving his wife, either way they fought all the time and didn’t last 2 years 2) idk who he was, 3) an emotionally abusive jerk who is controlling, needy and combatively volatile. They won’t last, she goes through guys like tic tacs 4) an alcoholic/addict who claims to be a “nice guy” but is racist, misogynistic and masking an enormous amount of rage. He stopped using because she’s the new vice. That’ll end well….I sincerely doubt they’ll make it past 2-3 years. He’s all in his ego about his addiction making him tough. I’m like, bro the lack of humility around your addiction is screaming for help rn. 

So, idk. I am good for these women/eros. They’re not good for me. I need to be with someone who is aware of their childhood issues and patterns, who wants real love, and who will choose me fully. No confusion about sexuality or who/what they want out of life. Absolutely no love triangles. No deception or manipulation. Slow burn to make sure we’re compatible and can build trust, and so we can learn who each other are past fantasy/projection. I want it to be real for both of us. I need emotional availability with good communication and healthy boundaries. I’m not ready to jump into anything, I need to go slow and date first to make sure I’m safe with the other person.

I’m actually very good for women, and men. They aren’t always for me. It’s my job to protect myself. I’ve been through enough. I will detach and leave if I feel like I’m in danger of getting hurt.

I need a whole life. I won’t chase anyone and waste my emotional energy or life on someone who isn’t serious. No running, no chasing. I plan on being centered in my life. I’m not playing games.

Eros 2. She’s married. I like what I know about her, but I don’t know the whole her. It’s not love. It is Cupid. And a little Eros. I wish circumstances had been different. I wanted to get to know her and talk to her and she kept running away. I was sick, and that was not good for either of us. I did my best to protect her from what I was going through. It was best nothing happened because I needed to heal first. I just didn’t want to lose my shot with her. Obviously I projected some things. She is absolutely my type though. I know what I like and love; she’s that. I’m not going to feel bad for how attracted I am to her. I’m attracted to someone who reminds me of the parts of my Mom I want to love, nurture and protect. There’s nothing wrong with that. I feel protective of S because she pings that energy in me. I love how fun and romantic her Eros is but I’m in love with how beautiful, perfect and vulnerable her Psyche is. I just want to hold her, kiss her neck/palms/lips, make dinner together, slow dance in candlelight and make love to her. I want her to feel safe and loved with me. I want her to choose me as the person she desires to come home to. I want to make her coffee or tea when she wakes up in the morning. She’s a social woman, she’s an intelligent woman, I love watching her work. There’s so much more underneath that though. I want the sensitive soul with a kind heart. I want the part of her she hides and protects. I want her. She is my fantasy, she’s my dream. That’s the vibe I want in my home, and the energy I want to come home to. I want someone who values my Eros in Taurus, and who not only needs it but will treat it with respect. I have a lot of love to give the right person. I want my relationship and home to be spiritual and sexual, emotionally connected and strong enough for us to feel safe having separate selves and separate daily routines. Eros 2 may not be the one to make my dream/fantasy come true, but the fantasy persists. I know what I desire.

The reality is she got married…is married. I have to let go of her. I know what I felt. I was so scared. I’d just been through my exwife and Caroline and not remotely recovered. My life was falling apart. I was broke and sick from Covid. It was not a good time to catch feelings, I was deeply wounded. I was already yeeted out of body and when we talked I yeeted myself further into the archetypal realm. Whether it was psychosis or not, who knows? I lived a myth and hallucinated nothing. People were very responsive to my spicy energy, there were 4 Eros’, I got hurt a lot, the heartbreak was visceral. I died in the underworld and now I’m very clear on not allowing myself to hurt like that ever again.

I have no right to be hurt she chose her husband over me. I’m just sad. I really wanted to live my dream with her. I wanted her to be the one.

Future boundaries: I will be chosen, unequivocally, and I will not be manipulated, used or deceived. “There is no love without trust.” I will do nothing, and feel nothing until I trust the other person.

Neptune and Saturn: compassionate boundaries. I’m still Neptunian but an upgraded version with an inner Psyche who knows her worth. And a 1st house Saturn in Libra that demands fairness, equality and respect. 

Hopefully I’ll find the person I’m meant to have healthy love with, and I’ll get my fantasy for real. That’s the dream. That’s the goal.

I want it to be safe for me to love someone. I want to live my fantasy-and be loved and chosen-for real. ",1,1765409999.0,u_NewNeptuneSaturn,0,1.0,False

Hello? I'm recording this from the waves of the dead, in the sea that I now fear like nothing else.

I hope this audio tape doesn't get wet or damaged, it would sure be a disaster to not know what happened to all of these people.

I'm just a boat sailor with a few years of experience, I do different jobs on the waters to earn my living. 

Perhaps I took the most dangerous one this time but it sure paid a good amount to counter that fear of the weather that I was going to witness. 

This part of the waterside was known as the devil's homeland by people, I was always skeptical, never really believed.


Chapter 1

I usually did any time of boat sailing myself, no crew or anything.
 
I know it's not recommended but I was really into earning as much as I possibly could.

So I'll start off, it was a rainy night with the weather of the sky settling in like foam on a cup of coffee. 

Trust me it wasn't that pretty or anything, in fact it gave me weird vibes but like often I'd brush it off and get going.

I had a habit of constantly repeating numbers out loud with a soft tone whilst multitasking, *1,2,3,3,2,1 and I continued... 
I abruptly stopped for no reason and I could hear a voice oddly disturbing repeating the numbers.... 

Whatever it was, it stopped like a few seconds after me, I was terrified... checked everywhere on my boat, couldn't find a soul.

Maybe it wasn't a soul, something else that hid itself from me, something more sinister and darker than what holds the surface.

As my brain went into overthinking mode, it brought more fear with it, with a singular odd encounter.
I was going up a few mountains in my head, I was even having a fever with a high temperature.

In my bed,..I got a whisper on my ear
""Hey do you wanna see the pile?"" 
I shout back ""What are you?!"" 

Seconds passed and nothing but the noises of the oceans captivated my ears, ""Oh lord maybe I'm the crackhead"".

But I wasn't really buying into what I said, I knew I said that to ease myself from whatever is out here.

Hours passed away and the waves intertwining with each other is a common theme here, It's something I've got used to at this point and it's what I loved and still love.. just not as dearly.


I found my body shaking in the dusk of the night, my eyes weren't as visually capable anymore for some reason though I squinted and saw a big skull right in front of me.

I got up in a heartbeat from my chair, as I got near to the skull, I could see it had blood and it was reddish on the inside. 

My first thought was that the strong waves placed it here....but that's a rare possibility, it would need someone who freshly died on the sea.

This surely didn't come from the ocean itself, I convinced myself. I grew audibly frustrated as terror shifted down my spine and swept me away.

""Heck, what is this thing?!"" Anger consumed me and I threw the skull as far as I could in the waters that surrounded me on all sides.

As I watched it drown and start to disappear in the depths of the ocean, my boat started shaking and waves grew taller in height and a loud noise came from behind me.

I turned around whilst barely holding onto a metal pole, I squinted again and in the distance I could see a ship....
""Who would even come here?"" I managed by moving slowly to grab my binoculars

""It's a ship.... full of people"" I said to myself...I looked again to see more clearly since clouds covered the ship and it was pretty hard to see a thing.

""Finally"" a small window of the clouds was open and I could see... corpses with their organs out, eyes on the floor of the ship,  pieces of bones and skulls spread out all over the ship which had turned reddish from the blood of the many and many dead people there.

""Fuck that!"" I threw my binoculars into the abyss and watched it sink as I infrequently started to swear and breathe. I needed to calm myself down.

I couldn't process what my eyes saw, my brain wasn't able to comprehend the scene...it didn't want to and neither did I.

Here I was in the middle of the night with a ship lurking towards me. 
""1,2,3...3,2,1"".

Chapter 2

The waves clash with the ship as it gets closer to me, I tried paddling away but somehow, perhaps a miracle..no matter how I paddled it only got closer and closer.

Whistles took the sky and anything alive, I never in my life had heard such whistles before.

They were persistent and timed, clouds moved  on double speed whenever a whistle started and it stopped moving when there was no whistling.

I found myself stuck and unable to do anything, ""These whistles are really starting to piss me off"" I said out loud in an annoyed tone.

"" Get on, get on"" a voice echoed through the ocean and reverberated...like we were in a bathroom or something... sorry for my lack of being able to explain as well but I didn't and still don't know how that was possible.

After one hour it finally stopped, I was ecstatic to not hear it any longer, whilst all of this, the ship closed the gap and here it is basically hugging the boat of mine.

First thing that I noticed was the smell, I didn't think it would be this bad, after all it was human flesh but I managed to get on the ship... walking around while with a hand covering my mouth and nose.

Unfortunately there wasn't much apart from dead corpses and organs spread all over the ship... that's when I discovered a small notebook...
""Title: *The Whistlers* 
The cover of the book was blackish with a few fingerprints or footprints, Couldn't tell as I kept puking every two minutes until I got off the ship.

"" Pfff, that's a relief! To get off that thing"" 
I was tired but had to paddle away from the ship...as I turn to glance at it for a final time, 
It's not there...I close and open my eyes rapidly but nothing appears.

"" What is happening?!"" I let myself out In frustration and disbelief....they started the same ol whistles... Rhythmically in movement with the waves and clouds.

I decided to ignore and simply open the notebook that I had in possession, None of the text was readible... I'm pretty sure those weren't even letters, at least not in this world.

Except for two sentences on last page of it, 
""Death shall come in peaceful weather and whistles"" 
""They'll come when it disappears"" 

""What is this? Who are they talking about"" I asked myself, I had no answer. Not a clue in the slightest.
Who are they? And what disappears? The ship? It was my best guess.

I felt cornered and tension was being built in me every second that passed by, my veins drew themselves on my forehead. 
I was frightened and scared of...of everything. 

I fell asleep whilst being in my thoughts, I woke up with a hat and my hands covered in blood.
""Oh God what happened?"" 
I shout and cope.
1,2,3...3,2,1... And so on I counted repeatedly.

Chapter 3

I got up from the chair in my boat, reddish skulls loomed over my head like a circus.

They were spinning and then spat at me left and right, I struggled to protect myself from these witchcraft themed things.

I retreated behind the chair and took blows every now and then until it eventually stopped.
I was exhausted and drained... scared of what torment I would experience next.

""Help* I let out a desperate call in the ocean's embrace but nothing responded.

*Whistling* ""Oh great here we go again!"" I laughed out of frustration and anger boiled up deep inside in the veins of my forehead. 

""Will you stop?!"" They only got louder and louder. I shut my earholes with my fingers and closed my eyes.
I started counting again....1,2,3....3,2,1 and so on.

Chapter 4

I fell asleep for the 100th time by now, I've lost all meaning of time or hope. This ocean has become a prison that I unfortunately can't leave.

The whistling...it never seems to stop or end.
""Enough will ya? There was like always no response to my yelling, why would there be.

In the midst of all of this, I don't think I was near completing or even coming close to getting where I was supposed to.

It felt like I was in a different area and time...pff even in a different world on the glob.

Another day passes by.... whistling and my counting fills the silence with the waves in this hellhole.

"" I have to get out of this mess, I can't listen to waves and whistles for god knows how long""

An odd and sharply deep voice responded seemingly out of sight. 
"" You're not wrong, Don't lose hope.""

""Who and where are you? No answer...
"" Hey, answer me! 
Absolutely nothing enlightened me.

Out of lack of energy or perhaps stress... I tucked into a ball and slept.
""..1,2,3...3,2,1....and so I continued until I lost consciousness.

-Writing- 
*The same sharply deep voice started speaking, I rolled my eyes and my sleeves up.

""O sailor of the sea, do you know how much you mean to me? 
What made you come out here? You knew the risks and the fails of the fallen.
The cursed ones as well, although you stepped me on my toe, You have a price to pay to cleanse yourself""

My brain was too tired and barely functional to absorb the stuff that I heard, I decided to yet again sleep my night away.
Hoping I'll wake up better than yesterday.

Chapter 5

Stuck in all of this mess, I was always getting voices from places I couldn't see, What's the point? 

As I kept watching my compass and trying to steer the boat towards where I came from, a manly scream was heard in the distance. It was so loud it that I was sure he was on the boat.

""I'm not having any of this, I'm out of here"" 
I spoke with a firm tone and proceeded to lure myself away from all of this torture that I got myself into.

Thinking back, I was doing my job but this zone..it was a weird one with barriers that I perhaps didn't recognise or realise at the time.

As I kept sailing back and forth, I eventually left the zone, utter relief came upon me. I was physically and mentally doing better already.

""This is good...dd"" At the corner of my eye I saw the ship....""No this can't be...But I'm not there anymore!"" 

The clouds fogged and so did my mind, tornados formed and the whistles started...the notebook flew out of the boat like a fish wanting to escape.

The ambience of the devil's homeland truly visible and in full form... reddish glowing in the waves that only proceeded to become bigger and bigger.

A cat as black as the night appeared on my peripheral view on the boat, on the right side...It stared into my soul.

I didn't gather any courage to approach it and then it spoke...yes a cat spoke.
""Leaving? You can't. Not until He has enough fun of keeping you here"" 

I turned around and closed my eyes and prayed that whatever was there would leave me alone... after a bit I felt safer to interact with the world again.

Was the devil keeping me on this thread of torture? 
I was blaming myself for getting into this mess.

The same old chair comforted me whilst I count like all the other times... with the ship spinning around and the whistling every now and then that I try to ignore.

""..1,..2..,3,..3,..2,..1.."" 

Chapter 6

The ocean turned small, I felt alone...and in captivation, the gaze of eyes in the distance, they're shooting glares at me.

""How much more do I have to suffer?
What does He want from me"" 

With my patience being so thin of a rope, I found myself thinking about ending it all.

What's the point of simply existing when you're tight to torture and pain, I know I sound depressing right now but I was back then.

I grabbed the black notebook and threw it in the depths of the ocean with filled frustration and anger. 

Before me a whole opened in the ocean like a black hole and It sucked me, I only remember being dragged in and the waves spinning like a tornado.

Last thing I remember is losing consciousness, only to wake up in an environment with calm waves and darkness surrounding me.

""Uh where am I?"" I asked myself 

I appeared to be on a boat..it had a few torches, anything was barely visible...what dimension or world have I entered? 

""Son, do not worry"" a voice unlike other spoke, It was strange but calmness in it assured me to stop shaking.

I turned right and saw death itself, the one we would draw as kids, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Grim Reaper himself in the boat.

""Wai-tt you're death-hh? I stuttered 
He nodded his head and smiled.

"" Though I'm not here to take you away"".

 Chapter 7

""Unfortunately you're dead but I'm gonna bring you back to life....I think you've seen enough but I need you to do something for me here first"".

I asked "" Yes what is it?""

He slowly adjusted and said "" I got a mission for you in these blackness of waves, find me the notebook that you threw""

I didn't hesitate to answer "" But it's probably not even here? Aren't we in a different place or something?""

He shortly replied whilst patting me 
"" Relax, It's out there somewhere, Go... I'll be with you in the dark""

I reluctantly agreed after being reassured.

And so I started sailing with the boat, Hard to see anything but after a while I could see a ship in the distance.

A shot of nostalgia went through my veins
"" Wait, is this the same ship as the one...no it can't be.""

I heard a voice behind me like a whisper, it was death.
"" Don't worry son, watch out for whistlers, don't look at them or speak to them if you see them look away""

"" Uhmm okay"" I knew by now that he didn't mean harm to me.

As my boat got closer to the ship, the odd smell of human flesh returned to my nose and with the torch in hand I managed to climb my way onto the ship.

"" Everything looks the same""

Death replied 
"" Not everyone""

"" You want me to check the corpses?"" 
I got no response but I had a feeling that's what he meant, through the rotten bones and skulls....one stood out, It had a black book in its mouth.

""Surely it's this one"" 
I grabbed it and left to the boat and sailed away....I called out to death.

""Hey I have it"" 

He appeared
"" very well""
"" Look, how about I return you to the state you were before the mission and please never try the devil's playground again, understood?""

I hesitated  
"" But? 
He interfered immediately 
""No but, just stay out of these waters son"" 

""Okay if you say so, what's in that book even? And who are the Whistlers and the ship with the dead piles of bodies?""

He looked at me and disappeared.

I yelled "" Answer me!""

All I heard was a snap of fingers and I woke up with the alarm clock ringing to my ears....

"" Oh god, here I am, home...

Death: ""Yes son you're here"" 

-Writing-

The first resurfacing of the skin in the pain of the eyes and here he comes to save what's innocent and unprotected.

He smiles and nods day and night... though he cries during midnight.

He carries a wound that's not his, a job nobody would wish for, answers that baffle you aren't for your heart.

Pour me in blood, pile me in the reddish wind of the sky
Drag me across the roads of no return.
I only then shall realise what was worth the most.

The lands of foreigners don't miss you, they don't recall seeing you either. 
Don't cut yourself with a knife, please sleep away with the realm of the world.

Fits the pastry stout profile, but it’s not overly sweet. Medium to medium-plus body, and way more complex than I expected. It’s not just a straight maple bomb like Great Notion... this has real maple sweetness, a touch of burnt sugar, and all the depth of charred maple wood, coffee, and chocolate. Super unique and genuinely enjoyable.

Hello? I'm recording this from the waves of the dead, in the sea that I now fear like nothing else.

I hope this audio tape doesn't get wet or damaged, it would sure be a disaster to not know what happened to all of these people.

I'm just a boat sailor with a few years of experience, I do different jobs on the waters to earn my living. 

Perhaps I took the most dangerous one this time but it sure paid a good amount to counter that fear of the weather that I was going to witness. 

This part of the waterside was known as the devil's homeland by people, I was always skeptical, never really believed.


Chapter 1

I usually did any time of boat sailing myself, no crew or anything.
 
I know it's not recommended but I was really into earning as much as I possibly could.

So I'll start off, it was a rainy night with the weather of the sky settling in like foam on a cup of coffee. 

Trust me it wasn't that pretty or anything, in fact it gave me weird vibes but like often I'd brush it off and get going.

I had a habit of constantly repeating numbers out loud with a soft tone whilst multitasking, *1,2,3,3,2,1 and I continued... 
I abruptly stopped for no reason and I could hear a voice oddly disturbing repeating the numbers.... 

Whatever it was, it stopped like a few seconds after me, I was terrified... checked everywhere on my boat, couldn't find a soul.

Maybe it wasn't a soul, something else that hid itself from me, something more sinister and darker than what holds the surface.

As my brain went into overthinking mode, it brought more fear with it, with a singular odd encounter.
I was going up a few mountains in my head, I was even having a fever with a high temperature.

In my bed,..I got a whisper on my ear
""Hey do you wanna see the pile?"" 
I shout back ""What are you?!"" 

Seconds passed and nothing but the noises of the oceans captivated my ears, ""Oh lord maybe I'm the crackhead"".

But I wasn't really buying into what I said, I knew I said that to ease myself from whatever is out here.

Hours passed away and the waves intertwining with each other is a common theme here, It's something I've got used to at this point and it's what I loved and still love.. just not as dearly.


I found my body shaking in the dusk of the night, my eyes weren't as visually capable anymore for some reason though I squinted and saw a big skull right in front of me.

I got up in a heartbeat from my chair, as I got near to the skull, I could see it had blood and it was reddish on the inside. 

My first thought was that the strong waves placed it here....but that's a rare possibility, it would need someone who freshly died on the sea.

This surely didn't come from the ocean itself, I convinced myself. I grew audibly frustrated as terror shifted down my spine and swept me away.

""Heck, what is this thing?!"" Anger consumed me and I threw the skull as far as I could in the waters that surrounded me on all sides.

As I watched it drown and start to disappear in the depths of the ocean, my boat started shaking and waves grew taller in height and a loud noise came from behind me.

I turned around whilst barely holding onto a metal pole, I squinted again and in the distance I could see a ship....
""Who would even come here?"" I managed by moving slowly to grab my binoculars

""It's a ship.... full of people"" I said to myself...I looked again to see more clearly since clouds covered the ship and it was pretty hard to see a thing.

""Finally"" a small window of the clouds was open and I could see... corpses with their organs out, eyes on the floor of the ship,  pieces of bones and skulls spread out all over the ship which had turned reddish from the blood of the many and many dead people there.

""Fuck that!"" I threw my binoculars into the abyss and watched it sink as I infrequently started to swear and breathe. I needed to calm myself down.

I couldn't process what my eyes saw, my brain wasn't able to comprehend the scene...it didn't want to and neither did I.

Here I was in the middle of the night with a ship lurking towards me. 
""1,2,3...3,2,1"".

Chapter 2

The waves clash with the ship as it gets closer to me, I tried paddling away but somehow, perhaps a miracle..no matter how I paddled it only got closer and closer.

Whistles took the sky and anything alive, I never in my life had heard such whistles before.

They were persistent and timed, clouds moved  on double speed whenever a whistle started and it stopped moving when there was no whistling.

I found myself stuck and unable to do anything, ""These whistles are really starting to piss me off"" I said out loud in an annoyed tone.

"" Get on, get on"" a voice echoed through the ocean and reverberated...like we were in a bathroom or something... sorry for my lack of being able to explain as well but I didn't and still don't know how that was possible.

After one hour it finally stopped, I was ecstatic to not hear it any longer, whilst all of this, the ship closed the gap and here it is basically hugging the boat of mine.

First thing that I noticed was the smell, I didn't think it would be this bad, after all it was human flesh but I managed to get on the ship... walking around while with a hand covering my mouth and nose.

Unfortunately there wasn't much apart from dead corpses and organs spread all over the ship... that's when I discovered a small notebook...
""Title: *The Whistlers* 
The cover of the book was blackish with a few fingerprints or footprints, Couldn't tell as I kept puking every two minutes until I got off the ship.

"" Pfff, that's a relief! To get off that thing"" 
I was tired but had to paddle away from the ship...as I turn to glance at it for a final time, 
It's not there...I close and open my eyes rapidly but nothing appears.

"" What is happening?!"" I let myself out In frustration and disbelief....they started the same ol whistles... Rhythmically in movement with the waves and clouds.

I decided to ignore and simply open the notebook that I had in possession, None of the text was readible... I'm pretty sure those weren't even letters, at least not in this world.

Except for two sentences on last page of it, 
""Death shall come in peaceful weather and whistles"" 
""They'll come when it disappears"" 

""What is this? Who are they talking about"" I asked myself, I had no answer. Not a clue in the slightest.
Who are they? And what disappears? The ship? It was my best guess.

I felt cornered and tension was being built in me every second that passed by, my veins drew themselves on my forehead. 
I was frightened and scared of...of everything. 

I fell asleep whilst being in my thoughts, I woke up with a hat and my hands covered in blood.
""Oh God what happened?"" 
I shout and cope.
1,2,3...3,2,1... And so on I counted repeatedly.

Chapter 3

I got up from the chair in my boat, reddish skulls loomed over my head like a circus.

They were spinning and then spat at me left and right, I struggled to protect myself from these witchcraft themed things.

I retreated behind the chair and took blows every now and then until it eventually stopped.
I was exhausted and drained... scared of what torment I would experience next.

""Help* I let out a desperate call in the ocean's embrace but nothing responded.

*Whistling* ""Oh great here we go again!"" I laughed out of frustration and anger boiled up deep inside in the veins of my forehead. 

""Will you stop?!"" They only got louder and louder. I shut my earholes with my fingers and closed my eyes.
I started counting again....1,2,3....3,2,1 and so on.

Chapter 4

I fell asleep for the 100th time by now, I've lost all meaning of time or hope. This ocean has become a prison that I unfortunately can't leave.

The whistling...it never seems to stop or end.
""Enough will ya? There was like always no response to my yelling, why would there be.

In the midst of all of this, I don't think I was near completing or even coming close to getting where I was supposed to.

It felt like I was in a different area and time...pff even in a different world on the glob.

Another day passes by.... whistling and my counting fills the silence with the waves in this hellhole.

"" I have to get out of this mess, I can't listen to waves and whistles for god knows how long""

An odd and sharply deep voice responded seemingly out of sight. 
"" You're not wrong, Don't lose hope.""

""Who and where are you? No answer...
"" Hey, answer me! 
Absolutely nothing enlightened me.

Out of lack of energy or perhaps stress... I tucked into a ball and slept.
""..1,2,3...3,2,1....and so I continued until I lost consciousness.

-Writing- 
*The same sharply deep voice started speaking, I rolled my eyes and my sleeves up.

""O sailor of the sea, do you know how much you mean to me? 
What made you come out here? You knew the risks and the fails of the fallen.
The cursed ones as well, although you stepped me on my toe, You have a price to pay to cleanse yourself""

My brain was too tired and barely functional to absorb the stuff that I heard, I decided to yet again sleep my night away.
Hoping I'll wake up better than yesterday.

Chapter 5

Stuck in all of this mess, I was always getting voices from places I couldn't see, What's the point? 

As I kept watching my compass and trying to steer the boat towards where I came from, a manly scream was heard in the distance. It was so loud it that I was sure he was on the boat.

""I'm not having any of this, I'm out of here"" 
I spoke with a firm tone and proceeded to lure myself away from all of this torture that I got myself into.

Thinking back, I was doing my job but this zone..it was a weird one with barriers that I perhaps didn't recognise or realise at the time.

As I kept sailing back and forth, I eventually left the zone, utter relief came upon me. I was physically and mentally doing better already.

""This is good...dd"" At the corner of my eye I saw the ship....""No this can't be...But I'm not there anymore!"" 

The clouds fogged and so did my mind, tornados formed and the whistles started...the notebook flew out of the boat like a fish wanting to escape.

The ambience of the devil's homeland truly visible and in full form... reddish glowing in the waves that only proceeded to become bigger and bigger.

A cat as black as the night appeared on my peripheral view on the boat, on the right side...It stared into my soul.

I didn't gather any courage to approach it and then it spoke...yes a cat spoke.
""Leaving? You can't. Not until He has enough fun of keeping you here"" 

I turned around and closed my eyes and prayed that whatever was there would leave me alone... after a bit I felt safer to interact with the world again.

Was the devil keeping me on this thread of torture? 
I was blaming myself for getting into this mess.

The same old chair comforted me whilst I count like all the other times... with the ship spinning around and the whistling every now and then that I try to ignore.

""..1,..2..,3,..3,..2,..1.."" 

Chapter 6

The ocean turned small, I felt alone...and in captivation, the gaze of eyes in the distance, they're shooting glares at me.

""How much more do I have to suffer?
What does He want from me"" 

With my patience being so thin of a rope, I found myself thinking about ending it all.

What's the point of simply existing when you're tight to torture and pain, I know I sound depressing right now but I was back then.

I grabbed the black notebook and threw it in the depths of the ocean with filled frustration and anger. 

Before me a whole opened in the ocean like a black hole and It sucked me, I only remember being dragged in and the waves spinning like a tornado.

Last thing I remember is losing consciousness, only to wake up in an environment with calm waves and darkness surrounding me.

""Uh where am I?"" I asked myself 

I appeared to be on a boat..it had a few torches, anything was barely visible...what dimension or world have I entered? 

""Son, do not worry"" a voice unlike other spoke, It was strange but calmness in it assured me to stop shaking.

I turned right and saw death itself, the one we would draw as kids, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Grim Reaper himself in the boat.

""Wai-tt you're death-hh? I stuttered 
He nodded his head and smiled.

"" Though I'm not here to take you away"".

 Chapter 7

""Unfortunately you're dead but I'm gonna bring you back to life....I think you've seen enough but I need you to do something for me here first"".

I asked "" Yes what is it?""

He slowly adjusted and said "" I got a mission for you in these blackness of waves, find me the notebook that you threw""

I didn't hesitate to answer "" But it's probably not even here? Aren't we in a different place or something?""

He shortly replied whilst patting me 
"" Relax, It's out there somewhere, Go... I'll be with you in the dark""

I reluctantly agreed after being reassured.

And so I started sailing with the boat, Hard to see anything but after a while I could see a ship in the distance.

A shot of nostalgia went through my veins
"" Wait, is this the same ship as the one...no it can't be.""

I heard a voice behind me like a whisper, it was death.
"" Don't worry son, watch out for whistlers, don't look at them or speak to them if you see them look away""

"" Uhmm okay"" I knew by now that he didn't mean harm to me.

As my boat got closer to the ship, the odd smell of human flesh returned to my nose and with the torch in hand I managed to climb my way onto the ship.

"" Everything looks the same""

Death replied 
"" Not everyone""

"" You want me to check the corpses?"" 
I got no response but I had a feeling that's what he meant, through the rotten bones and skulls....one stood out, It had a black book in its mouth.

""Surely it's this one"" 
I grabbed it and left to the boat and sailed away....I called out to death.

""Hey I have it"" 

He appeared
"" very well""
"" Look, how about I return you to the state you were before the mission and please never try the devil's playground again, understood?""

I hesitated  
"" But? 
He interfered immediately 
""No but, just stay out of these waters son"" 

""Okay if you say so, what's in that book even? And who are the Whistlers and the ship with the dead piles of bodies?""

He looked at me and disappeared.

I yelled "" Answer me!""

All I heard was a snap of fingers and I woke up with the alarm clock ringing to my ears....

"" Oh god, here I am, home...

Death: ""Yes son you're here"" 

-Writing-

The first resurfacing of the skin in the pain of the eyes and here he comes to save what's innocent and unprotected.

He smiles and nods day and night... though he cries during midnight.

He carries a wound that's not his, a job nobody would wish for, answers that baffle you aren't for your heart.

Pour me in blood, pile me in the reddish wind of the sky
Drag me across the roads of no return.
I only then shall realise what was worth the most.

$4.50 /12% increase still leaves this as a great deal imo (under $22/bag out the door), so unless/until quality drops or other PE impact is seen I'll probably keep the sub but start screening each month and only get it when I think I'll like both bags and start diversifying more of my coffee purchases.",2,1765409860.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

"" Don't worry son, watch out for whistlers, don't look at them or speak to them if you see them look away""

"" Uhmm okay"" I knew by now that he didn't mean harm to me.

As my boat got closer to the ship, the odd smell of human flesh returned to my nose and with the torch in hand I managed to climb my way onto the ship.

"" Everything looks the same""

Death replied 
"" Not everyone""

"" You want me to check the corpses?"" 
I got no response but I had a feeling that's what he meant, through the rotten bones and skulls....one stood out, It had a black book in its mouth.

""Surely it's this one"" 
I grabbed it and left to the boat and sailed away....I called out to death.

""Hey I have it"" 

He appeared
"" very well""
"" Look, how about I return you to the state you were before the mission and please never try the devil's playground again, understood?""

I hesitated  
"" But? 
He interfered immediately 
""No but, just stay out of these waters son"" 

""Okay if you say so, what's in that book even? And who are the Whistlers and the ship with the dead piles of bodies?""

He looked at me and disappeared.

I yelled "" Answer me!""

All I heard was a snap of fingers and I woke up with the alarm clock ringing to my ears....

"" Oh god, here I am, home...

Death: ""Yes son you're here"" 

-Writing-

The first resurfacing of the skin in the pain of the eyes and here he comes to save what's innocent and unprotected.

He smiles and nods day and night... though he cries during midnight.

He carries a wound that's not his, a job nobody would wish for, answers that baffle you aren't for your heart.

Pour me in blood, pile me in the reddish wind of the sky
Drag me across the roads of no return.
I only then shall realise what was worth the most.

The lands of foreigners don't miss you, they don't recall seeing you either. 
Don't cut yourself with a knife, please sleep away with the realm of the world.

Hello? I'm recording this from the waves of the dead, in the sea that I now fear like nothing else.

I hope this audio tape doesn't get wet or damaged, it would sure be a disaster to not know what happened to all of these people.

I'm just a boat sailor with a few years of experience, I do different jobs on the waters to earn my living. 

Perhaps I took the most dangerous one this time but it sure paid a good amount to counter that fear of the weather that I was going to witness. 

This part of the waterside was known as the devil's homeland by people, I was always skeptical, never really believed.


Chapter 1

I usually did any time of boat sailing myself, no crew or anything.
 
I know it's not recommended but I was really into earning as much as I possibly could.

So I'll start off, it was a rainy night with the weather of the sky settling in like foam on a cup of coffee. 

Trust me it wasn't that pretty or anything, in fact it gave me weird vibes but like often I'd brush it off and get going.

I had a habit of constantly repeating numbers out loud with a soft tone whilst multitasking, *1,2,3,3,2,1 and I continued... 
I abruptly stopped for no reason and I could hear a voice oddly disturbing repeating the numbers.... 

Whatever it was, it stopped like a few seconds after me, I was terrified... checked everywhere on my boat, couldn't find a soul.

Maybe it wasn't a soul, something else that hid itself from me, something more sinister and darker than what holds the surface.

As my brain went into overthinking mode, it brought more fear with it, with a singular odd encounter.
I was going up a few mountains in my head, I was even having a fever with a high temperature.

In my bed,..I got a whisper on my ear
""Hey do you wanna see the pile?"" 
I shout back ""What are you?!"" 

Seconds passed and nothing but the noises of the oceans captivated my ears, ""Oh lord maybe I'm the crackhead"".

But I wasn't really buying into what I said, I knew I said that to ease myself from whatever is out here.

Hours passed away and the waves intertwining with each other is a common theme here, It's something I've got used to at this point and it's what I loved and still love.. just not as dearly.


I found my body shaking in the dusk of the night, my eyes weren't as visually capable anymore for some reason though I squinted and saw a big skull right in front of me.

I got up in a heartbeat from my chair, as I got near to the skull, I could see it had blood and it was reddish on the inside. 

My first thought was that the strong waves placed it here....but that's a rare possibility, it would need someone who freshly died on the sea.

This surely didn't come from the ocean itself, I convinced myself. I grew audibly frustrated as terror shifted down my spine and swept me away.

""Heck, what is this thing?!"" Anger consumed me and I threw the skull as far as I could in the waters that surrounded me on all sides.

As I watched it drown and start to disappear in the depths of the ocean, my boat started shaking and waves grew taller in height and a loud noise came from behind me.

I turned around whilst barely holding onto a metal pole, I squinted again and in the distance I could see a ship....
""Who would even come here?"" I managed by moving slowly to grab my binoculars

""It's a ship.... full of people"" I said to myself...I looked again to see more clearly since clouds covered the ship and it was pretty hard to see a thing.

""Finally"" a small window of the clouds was open and I could see... corpses with their organs out, eyes on the floor of the ship,  pieces of bones and skulls spread out all over the ship which had turned reddish from the blood of the many and many dead people there.

""Fuck that!"" I threw my binoculars into the abyss and watched it sink as I infrequently started to swear and breathe. I needed to calm myself down.

I couldn't process what my eyes saw, my brain wasn't able to comprehend the scene...it didn't want to and neither did I.

Here I was in the middle of the night with a ship lurking towards me. 
""1,2,3...3,2,1"".

Chapter 2

The waves clash with the ship as it gets closer to me, I tried paddling away but somehow, perhaps a miracle..no matter how I paddled it only got closer and closer.

Whistles took the sky and anything alive, I never in my life had heard such whistles before.

They were persistent and timed, clouds moved  on double speed whenever a whistle started and it stopped moving when there was no whistling.

I found myself stuck and unable to do anything, ""These whistles are really starting to piss me off"" I said out loud in an annoyed tone.

"" Get on, get on"" a voice echoed through the ocean and reverberated...like we were in a bathroom or something... sorry for my lack of being able to explain as well but I didn't and still don't know how that was possible.

After one hour it finally stopped, I was ecstatic to not hear it any longer, whilst all of this, the ship closed the gap and here it is basically hugging the boat of mine.

First thing that I noticed was the smell, I didn't think it would be this bad, after all it was human flesh but I managed to get on the ship... walking around while with a hand covering my mouth and nose.

Unfortunately there wasn't much apart from dead corpses and organs spread all over the ship... that's when I discovered a small notebook...
""Title: *The Whistlers* 
The cover of the book was blackish with a few fingerprints or footprints, Couldn't tell as I kept puking every two minutes until I got off the ship.

"" Pfff, that's a relief! To get off that thing"" 
I was tired but had to paddle away from the ship...as I turn to glance at it for a final time, 
It's not there...I close and open my eyes rapidly but nothing appears.

"" What is happening?!"" I let myself out In frustration and disbelief....they started the same ol whistles... Rhythmically in movement with the waves and clouds.

I decided to ignore and simply open the notebook that I had in possession, None of the text was readible... I'm pretty sure those weren't even letters, at least not in this world.

Except for two sentences on last page of it, 
""Death shall come in peaceful weather and whistles"" 
""They'll come when it disappears"" 

""What is this? Who are they talking about"" I asked myself, I had no answer. Not a clue in the slightest.
Who are they? And what disappears? The ship? It was my best guess.

I felt cornered and tension was being built in me every second that passed by, my veins drew themselves on my forehead. 
I was frightened and scared of...of everything. 

I fell asleep whilst being in my thoughts, I woke up with a hat and my hands covered in blood.
""Oh God what happened?"" 
I shout and cope.
1,2,3...3,2,1... And so on I counted repeatedly.

Chapter 3

I got up from the chair in my boat, reddish skulls loomed over my head like a circus.

They were spinning and then spat at me left and right, I struggled to protect myself from these witchcraft themed things.

I retreated behind the chair and took blows every now and then until it eventually stopped.
I was exhausted and drained... scared of what torment I would experience next.

""Help* I let out a desperate call in the ocean's embrace but nothing responded.

*Whistling* ""Oh great here we go again!"" I laughed out of frustration and anger boiled up deep inside in the veins of my forehead. 

""Will you stop?!"" They only got louder and louder. I shut my earholes with my fingers and closed my eyes.
I started counting again....1,2,3....3,2,1 and so on.

Chapter 4

I fell asleep for the 100th time by now, I've lost all meaning of time or hope. This ocean has become a prison that I unfortunately can't leave.

The whistling...it never seems to stop or end.
""Enough will ya? There was like always no response to my yelling, why would there be.

In the midst of all of this, I don't think I was near completing or even coming close to getting where I was supposed to.

It felt like I was in a different area and time...pff even in a different world on the glob.

Another day passes by.... whistling and my counting fills the silence with the waves in this hellhole.

"" I have to get out of this mess, I can't listen to waves and whistles for god knows how long""

An odd and sharply deep voice responded seemingly out of sight. 
"" You're not wrong, Don't lose hope.""

""Who and where are you? No answer...
"" Hey, answer me! 
Absolutely nothing enlightened me.

Out of lack of energy or perhaps stress... I tucked into a ball and slept.
""..1,2,3...3,2,1....and so I continued until I lost consciousness.

-Writing- 
*The same sharply deep voice started speaking, I rolled my eyes and my sleeves up.

""O sailor of the sea, do you know how much you mean to me? 
What made you come out here? You knew the risks and the fails of the fallen.
The cursed ones as well, although you stepped me on my toe, You have a price to pay to cleanse yourself""

My brain was too tired and barely functional to absorb the stuff that I heard, I decided to yet again sleep my night away.
Hoping I'll wake up better than yesterday.

Chapter 5

Stuck in all of this mess, I was always getting voices from places I couldn't see, What's the point? 

As I kept watching my compass and trying to steer the boat towards where I came from, a manly scream was heard in the distance. It was so loud it that I was sure he was on the boat.

""I'm not having any of this, I'm out of here"" 
I spoke with a firm tone and proceeded to lure myself away from all of this torture that I got myself into.

Thinking back, I was doing my job but this zone..it was a weird one with barriers that I perhaps didn't recognise or realise at the time.

As I kept sailing back and forth, I eventually left the zone, utter relief came upon me. I was physically and mentally doing better already.

""This is good...dd"" At the corner of my eye I saw the ship....""No this can't be...But I'm not there anymore!"" 

The clouds fogged and so did my mind, tornados formed and the whistles started...the notebook flew out of the boat like a fish wanting to escape.

The ambience of the devil's homeland truly visible and in full form... reddish glowing in the waves that only proceeded to become bigger and bigger.

A cat as black as the night appeared on my peripheral view on the boat, on the right side...It stared into my soul.

I didn't gather any courage to approach it and then it spoke...yes a cat spoke.
""Leaving? You can't. Not until He has enough fun of keeping you here"" 

I turned around and closed my eyes and prayed that whatever was there would leave me alone... after a bit I felt safer to interact with the world again.

Was the devil keeping me on this thread of torture? 
I was blaming myself for getting into this mess.

The same old chair comforted me whilst I count like all the other times... with the ship spinning around and the whistling every now and then that I try to ignore.

""..1,..2..,3,..3,..2,..1.."" 

Chapter 6

The ocean turned small, I felt alone...and in captivation, the gaze of eyes in the distance, they're shooting glares at me.

""How much more do I have to suffer?
What does He want from me"" 

With my patience being so thin of a rope, I found myself thinking about ending it all.

What's the point of simply existing when you're tight to torture and pain, I know I sound depressing right now but I was back then.

I grabbed the black notebook and threw it in the depths of the ocean with filled frustration and anger. 

Before me a whole opened in the ocean like a black hole and It sucked me, I only remember being dragged in and the waves spinning like a tornado.

Last thing I remember is losing consciousness, only to wake up in an environment with calm waves and darkness surrounding me.

""Uh where am I?"" I asked myself 

I appeared to be on a boat..it had a few torches, anything was barely visible...what dimension or world have I entered? 

""Son, do not worry"" a voice unlike other spoke, It was strange but calmness in it assured me to stop shaking.

I turned right and saw death itself, the one we would draw as kids, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Grim Reaper himself in the boat.

""Wai-tt you're death-hh? I stuttered 
He nodded his head and smiled.

"" Though I'm not here to take you away"".

 Chapter 7

""Unfortunately you're dead but I'm gonna bring you back to life....I think you've seen enough but I need you to do something for me here first"".

I asked "" Yes what is it?""

He slowly adjusted and said "" I got a mission for you in these blackness of waves, find me the notebook that you threw""

I didn't hesitate to answer "" But it's probably not even here? Aren't we in a different place or something?""

He shortly replied whilst patting me 
"" Relax, It's out there somewhere, Go... I'll be with you in the dark""

I reluctantly agreed after being reassured.

And so I started sailing with the boat, Hard to see anything but after a while I could see a ship in the distance.

A shot of nostalgia went through my veins
"" Wait, is this the same ship as the one...no it can't be.""

I heard a voice behind me like a whisper, it was death.
"" Don't worry son, watch out for whistlers, don't look at them or speak to them if you see them look away""

"" Uhmm okay"" I knew by now that he didn't mean harm to me.

As my boat got closer to the ship, the odd smell of human flesh returned to my nose and with the torch in hand I managed to climb my way onto the ship.

I grabbed it and left to the boat and sailed away....I called out to death.

""Hey I have it"" 

He appeared
"" very well""
"" Look, how about I return you to the state you were before the mission and please never try the devil's playground again, understood?""

I hesitated  
"" But? 
He interfered immediately 
""No but, just stay out of these waters son"" 

""Okay if you say so, what's in that book even? And who are the Whistlers and the ship with the dead piles of bodies?""

He looked at me and disappeared.

I yelled "" Answer me!""

All I heard was a snap of fingers and I woke up with the alarm clock ringing to my ears....

"" Oh god, here I am, home...

Death: ""Yes son you're here""

1pji9ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1pji9ew/give_me_a_slow_laptop_coz_i_am_a_consultant/,Give me a slow laptop coz I am a consultant - expect slower throughput,"So this happened more than a decade ago when I worked as a consultant to a major pharma company. Now to be fair they were great people nice working culture etc very friendly relations between the pharma company devs and our devs. All great. Great WFH policy (in fact all us consultants worked remotely).



Everything except ONE thing. We all had laptops (shipped to the consultants) with very heavy software running on it and it was both CPU and Memory intensive. Again totally fair. As developers our job was to run these to locally run the code and develop it, modify it etc. One \*BIG\* difference. The regular employees got really great fast high speed machines. As ""Consultants"" we got the lower end ones, despite all of us having to debug and update the same code!

  
We brought this up to our team leads/managers/VP and to their higher-ups that ""hey our overall throughput would be significantly higher and your own cost would go down if our laptops could run these local servers faster"". The employee developers and teams leads also helped us make that same case.

  
Average laptop cost is say $1500 for a high end (at the time). Average cost of the lower end one say $800. So a difference of $700 per consultant (times say 10 consultants) would have brought the total cost to say $7K. Total amount of extra HOURS we billed them due to this MUCH MUCH higher.

  
But of course the bean counters at the parent company said, ""no way in hell are we giving the lowly consultants the best machines"". Add to that our main business point of contact was a real piece or work and pushed back \*just as vehemently\*. After lots of pleading arguing etc, we gave up. Now our strategy was simple. We'd simply get less work done in the day. To give everyone an idea of how this works. Each time you change a line of code and save. To recompile + restart the server locally it would easily take 10 mins on our consultant laptops (as opposed to just 3 mins on the employee laptops). We would deliberately make it compile multiple times. When the employee business team complained we'd screen-share and show them each time they complained, how long it took for even minor changes.

  
Funny thing was the consultants were all remote so we'd put the code to compile and go have coffee or do household chores lol. Their POS business contact tried to crack the whip on us, we said ""hey there really IS no way for us to go quicker without quicker laptops"". After 6 months of them falling behind on projects AND being over billed due to to more hours being spent, they FINALLY woke up from their slumber and upgraded our laptops to bring them in line with the employee ones!

  
Of course 2 months after we got better laptops I found a much better job and left. Still reminisce about those long coffee breaks though! ;-) Funniest part was when I called their helpdesk once. The agent quite literally admitted. ""You know I have worked here for 10 years now and I'll NEVER understand why the Directors and VPs need top of the line laptops when all they they run is word excel and powerpoint and meanwhile the ones actually doing the heavy computing get 5 year old laptops"".

Hello? I'm recording this from the waves of the dead, in the sea that I now fear like nothing else.

I hope this audio tape doesn't get wet or damaged, it would sure be a disaster to not know what happened to all of these people.

I'm just a boat sailor with a few years of experience, I do different jobs on the waters to earn my living. 

Perhaps I took the most dangerous one this time but it sure paid a good amount to counter that fear of the weather that I was going to witness. 

This part of the waterside was known as the devil's homeland by people, I was always skeptical, never really believed.


Chapter 1

I usually did any time of boat sailing myself, no crew or anything.
 
I know it's not recommended but I was really into earning as much as I possibly could.

So I'll start off, it was a rainy night with the weather of the sky settling in like foam on a cup of coffee. 

Trust me it wasn't that pretty or anything, in fact it gave me weird vibes but like often I'd brush it off and get going.

I had a habit of constantly repeating numbers out loud with a soft tone whilst multitasking, *1,2,3,3,2,1 and I continued... 
I abruptly stopped for no reason and I could hear a voice oddly disturbing repeating the numbers.... 

Whatever it was, it stopped like a few seconds after me, I was terrified... checked everywhere on my boat, couldn't find a soul.

Maybe it wasn't a soul, something else that hid itself from me, something more sinister and darker than what holds the surface.

As my brain went into overthinking mode, it brought more fear with it, with a singular odd encounter.
I was going up a few mountains in my head, I was even having a fever with a high temperature.

In my bed,..I got a whisper on my ear
""Hey do you wanna see the pile?"" 
I shout back ""What are you?!"" 

Seconds passed and nothing but the noises of the oceans captivated my ears, ""Oh lord maybe I'm the crackhead"".

But I wasn't really buying into what I said, I knew I said that to ease myself from whatever is out here.

Hours passed away and the waves intertwining with each other is a common theme here, It's something I've got used to at this point and it's what I loved and still love.. just not as dearly.


I found my body shaking in the dusk of the night, my eyes weren't as visually capable anymore for some reason though I squinted and saw a big skull right in front of me.

I got up in a heartbeat from my chair, as I got near to the skull, I could see it had blood and it was reddish on the inside. 

My first thought was that the strong waves placed it here....but that's a rare possibility, it would need someone who freshly died on the sea.

This surely didn't come from the ocean itself, I convinced myself. I grew audibly frustrated as terror shifted down my spine and swept me away.

""Heck, what is this thing?!"" Anger consumed me and I threw the skull as far as I could in the waters that surrounded me on all sides.

As I watched it drown and start to disappear in the depths of the ocean, my boat started shaking and waves grew taller in height and a loud noise came from behind me.

I turned around whilst barely holding onto a metal pole, I squinted again and in the distance I could see a ship....
""Who would even come here?"" I managed by moving slowly to grab my binoculars

""It's a ship.... full of people"" I said to myself...I looked again to see more clearly since clouds covered the ship and it was pretty hard to see a thing.

""Finally"" a small window of the clouds was open and I could see... corpses with their organs out, eyes on the floor of the ship,  pieces of bones and skulls spread out all over the ship which had turned reddish from the blood of the many and many dead people there.

""Fuck that!"" I threw my binoculars into the abyss and watched it sink as I infrequently started to swear and breathe. I needed to calm myself down.

I couldn't process what my eyes saw, my brain wasn't able to comprehend the scene...it didn't want to and neither did I.

Here I was in the middle of the night with a ship lurking towards me. 
""1,2,3...3,2,1"".

Chapter 2

The waves clash with the ship as it gets closer to me, I tried paddling away but somehow, perhaps a miracle..no matter how I paddled it only got closer and closer.

Whistles took the sky and anything alive, I never in my life had heard such whistles before.

They were persistent and timed, clouds moved  on double speed whenever a whistle started and it stopped moving when there was no whistling.

I found myself stuck and unable to do anything, ""These whistles are really starting to piss me off"" I said out loud in an annoyed tone.

"" Get on, get on"" a voice echoed through the ocean and reverberated...like we were in a bathroom or something... sorry for my lack of being able to explain as well but I didn't and still don't know how that was possible.

After one hour it finally stopped, I was ecstatic to not hear it any longer, whilst all of this, the ship closed the gap and here it is basically hugging the boat of mine.

First thing that I noticed was the smell, I didn't think it would be this bad, after all it was human flesh but I managed to get on the ship... walking around while with a hand covering my mouth and nose.

Unfortunately there wasn't much apart from dead corpses and organs spread all over the ship... that's when I discovered a small notebook...
""Title: *The Whistlers* 
The cover of the book was blackish with a few fingerprints or footprints, Couldn't tell as I kept puking every two minutes until I got off the ship.

"" Pfff, that's a relief! To get off that thing"" 
I was tired but had to paddle away from the ship...as I turn to glance at it for a final time, 
It's not there...I close and open my eyes rapidly but nothing appears.

"" What is happening?!"" I let myself out In frustration and disbelief....they started the same ol whistles... Rhythmically in movement with the waves and clouds.

I decided to ignore and simply open the notebook that I had in possession, None of the text was readible... I'm pretty sure those weren't even letters, at least not in this world.

Except for two sentences on last page of it, 
""Death shall come in peaceful weather and whistles"" 
""They'll come when it disappears"" 

""What is this? Who are they talking about"" I asked myself, I had no answer. Not a clue in the slightest.
Who are they? And what disappears? The ship? It was my best guess.

I felt cornered and tension was being built in me every second that passed by, my veins drew themselves on my forehead. 
I was frightened and scared of...of everything. 

I fell asleep whilst being in my thoughts, I woke up with a hat and my hands covered in blood.
""Oh God what happened?"" 
I shout and cope.
1,2,3...3,2,1... And so on I counted repeatedly.

Chapter 3

I got up from the chair in my boat, reddish skulls loomed over my head like a circus.

They were spinning and then spat at me left and right, I struggled to protect myself from these witchcraft themed things.

I retreated behind the chair and took blows every now and then until it eventually stopped.
I was exhausted and drained... scared of what torment I would experience next.

""Help* I let out a desperate call in the ocean's embrace but nothing responded.

*Whistling* ""Oh great here we go again!"" I laughed out of frustration and anger boiled up deep inside in the veins of my forehead. 

""Will you stop?!"" They only got louder and louder. I shut my earholes with my fingers and closed my eyes.
I started counting again....1,2,3....3,2,1 and so on.

Chapter 4

I fell asleep for the 100th time by now, I've lost all meaning of time or hope. This ocean has become a prison that I unfortunately can't leave.

The whistling...it never seems to stop or end.
""Enough will ya? There was like always no response to my yelling, why would there be.

In the midst of all of this, I don't think I was near completing or even coming close to getting where I was supposed to.

It felt like I was in a different area and time...pff even in a different world on the glob.

Another day passes by.... whistling and my counting fills the silence with the waves in this hellhole.

"" I have to get out of this mess, I can't listen to waves and whistles for god knows how long""

An odd and sharply deep voice responded seemingly out of sight. 
"" You're not wrong, Don't lose hope.""

""Who and where are you? No answer...
"" Hey, answer me! 
Absolutely nothing enlightened me.

Out of lack of energy or perhaps stress... I tucked into a ball and slept.
""..1,2,3...3,2,1....and so I continued until I lost consciousness.

-Writing- 
*The same sharply deep voice started speaking, I rolled my eyes and my sleeves up.

""O sailor of the sea, do you know how much you mean to me? 
What made you come out here? You knew the risks and the fails of the fallen.
The cursed ones as well, although you stepped me on my toe, You have a price to pay to cleanse yourself""

My brain was too tired and barely functional to absorb the stuff that I heard, I decided to yet again sleep my night away.
Hoping I'll wake up better than yesterday.

Chapter 5

Stuck in all of this mess, I was always getting voices from places I couldn't see, What's the point? 

As I kept watching my compass and trying to steer the boat towards where I came from, a manly scream was heard in the distance. It was so loud it that I was sure he was on the boat.

""I'm not having any of this, I'm out of here"" 
I spoke with a firm tone and proceeded to lure myself away from all of this torture that I got myself into.

Thinking back, I was doing my job but this zone..it was a weird one with barriers that I perhaps didn't recognise or realise at the time.

As I kept sailing back and forth, I eventually left the zone, utter relief came upon me. I was physically and mentally doing better already.

""This is good...dd"" At the corner of my eye I saw the ship....""No this can't be...But I'm not there anymore!"" 

The clouds fogged and so did my mind, tornados formed and the whistles started...the notebook flew out of the boat like a fish wanting to escape.

The ambience of the devil's homeland truly visible and in full form... reddish glowing in the waves that only proceeded to become bigger and bigger.

A cat as black as the night appeared on my peripheral view on the boat, on the right side...It stared into my soul.

I didn't gather any courage to approach it and then it spoke...yes a cat spoke.
""Leaving? You can't. Not until He has enough fun of keeping you here"" 

I turned around and closed my eyes and prayed that whatever was there would leave me alone... after a bit I felt safer to interact with the world again.

Was the devil keeping me on this thread of torture? 
I was blaming myself for getting into this mess.

The same old chair comforted me whilst I count like all the other times... with the ship spinning around and the whistling every now and then that I try to ignore.

""..1,..2..,3,..3,..2,..1.."" 

Chapter 6

The ocean turned small, I felt alone...and in captivation, the gaze of eyes in the distance, they're shooting glares at me.

""How much more do I have to suffer?
What does He want from me"" 

With my patience being so thin of a rope, I found myself thinking about ending it all.

What's the point of simply existing when you're tight to torture and pain, I know I sound depressing right now but I was back then.

I grabbed the black notebook and threw it in the depths of the ocean with filled frustration and anger. 

Before me a whole opened in the ocean like a black hole and It sucked me, I only remember being dragged in and the waves spinning like a tornado.

Last thing I remember is losing consciousness, only to wake up in an environment with calm waves and darkness surrounding me.

""Uh where am I?"" I asked myself 

I appeared to be on a boat..it had a few torches, anything was barely visible...what dimension or world have I entered? 

""Son, do not worry"" a voice unlike other spoke, It was strange but calmness in it assured me to stop shaking.

I turned right and saw death itself, the one we would draw as kids, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Grim Reaper himself in the boat.

""Wai-tt you're death-hh? I stuttered 
He nodded his head and smiled.

"" Though I'm not here to take you away"".

 Chapter 7

""Unfortunately you're dead but I'm gonna bring you back to life....I think you've seen enough but I need you to do something for me here first"".

I asked "" Yes what is it?""

He slowly adjusted and said "" I got a mission for you in these blackness of waves, find me the notebook that you threw""

I didn't hesitate to answer "" But it's probably not even here? Aren't we in a different place or something?""

He shortly replied whilst patting me 
"" Relax, It's out there somewhere, Go... I'll be with you in the dark""

I reluctantly agreed after being reassured.

And so I started sailing with the boat, Hard to see anything but after a while I could see a ship in the distance.

A shot of nostalgia went through my veins
"" Wait, is this the same ship as the one...no it can't be.""

I heard a voice behind me like a whisper, it was death.
"" Don't worry son, watch out for whistlers, don't look at them or speak to them if you see them look away""

"" Uhmm okay"" I knew by now that he didn't mean harm to me.

As my boat got closer to the ship, the odd smell of human flesh returned to my nose and with the torch in hand I managed to climb my way onto the ship.

"" Everything looks the same""

Death replied 
"" Not everyone""

"" You want me to check the corpses?"" 
I got no response but I had a feeling that's what he meant, through the rotten bones and skulls....one stood out, It had a black book in its mouth.

""Surely it's this one"" 
I grabbed it and left to the boat and sailed away....I called out to death.

""Hey I have it"" 

He appeared
"" very well""
"" Look, how about I return you to the state you were before the mission and please never try the devil's playground again, understood?""

I hesitated  
"" But? 
He interfered immediately 
""No but, just stay out of these waters son"" 

""Okay if you say so, what's in that book even? And who are the Whistlers and the ship with the dead piles of bodies?""

He looked at me and disappeared.

I yelled "" Answer me!""

All I heard was a snap of fingers and I woke up with the alarm clock ringing to my ears....

"" Oh god, here I am, home...

Death: ""Yes son you're here""

""Title: *The Whistlers* 
The cover of the book was blackish with a few fingerprints or footprints, Couldn't tell as I kept puking every two minutes until I got off the ship.

"" Pfff, that's a relief! To get off that thing"" 
I was tired but had to paddle away from the ship...as I turn to glance at it for a final time, 
It's not there...I close and open my eyes rapidly but nothing appears.

"" What is happening?!"" I let myself out In frustration and disbelief....they started the same ol whistles... Rhythmically in movement with the waves and clouds.

I decided to ignore and simply open the notebook that I had in possession, None of the text was readible... I'm pretty sure those weren't even letters, at least not in this world.

Except for two sentences on last page of it, 
""Death shall come in peaceful weather and whistles"" 
""They'll come when it disappears"" 

""What is this? Who are they talking about"" I asked myself, I had no answer. Not a clue in the slightest.
Who are they? And what disappears? The ship? It was my best guess.

I felt cornered and tension was being built in me every second that passed by, my veins drew themselves on my forehead. 
I was frightened and scared of...of everything. 

I fell asleep whilst being in my thoughts, I woke up with a hat and my hands covered in blood.
""Oh God what happened?"" 
I shout and cope.
1,2,3...3,2,1... And so on I counted repeatedly.

Chapter 3

I got up from the chair in my boat, reddish skulls loomed over my head like a circus.

They were spinning and then spat at me left and right, I struggled to protect myself from these witchcraft themed things.

I retreated behind the chair and took blows every now and then until it eventually stopped.
I was exhausted and drained... scared of what torment I would experience next.

""Help* I let out a desperate call in the ocean's embrace but nothing responded.

*Whistling* ""Oh great here we go again!"" I laughed out of frustration and anger boiled up deep inside in the veins of my forehead. 

""Will you stop?!"" They only got louder and louder. I shut my earholes with my fingers and closed my eyes.
I started counting again....1,2,3....3,2,1 and so on.

Chapter 4

I fell asleep for the 100th time by now, I've lost all meaning of time or hope. This ocean has become a prison that I unfortunately can't leave.

The whistling...it never seems to stop or end.
""Enough will ya? There was like always no response to my yelling, why would there be.

In the midst of all of this, I don't think I was near completing or even coming close to getting where I was supposed to.

It felt like I was in a different area and time...pff even in a different world on the glob.

Another day passes by.... whistling and my counting fills the silence with the waves in this hellhole.

"" I have to get out of this mess, I can't listen to waves and whistles for god knows how long""

An odd and sharply deep voice responded seemingly out of sight. 
"" You're not wrong, Don't lose hope.""

""Who and where are you? No answer...
"" Hey, answer me! 
Absolutely nothing enlightened me.

Out of lack of energy or perhaps stress... I tucked into a ball and slept.
""..1,2,3...3,2,1....and so I continued until I lost consciousness.

-Writing- 
*The same sharply deep voice started speaking, I rolled my eyes and my sleeves up.

""O sailor of the sea, do you know how much you mean to me? 
What made you come out here? You knew the risks and the fails of the fallen.
The cursed ones as well, although you stepped me on my toe, You have a price to pay to cleanse yourself""

My brain was too tired and barely functional to absorb the stuff that I heard, I decided to yet again sleep my night away.
Hoping I'll wake up better than yesterday.

Chapter 5

Stuck in all of this mess, I was always getting voices from places I couldn't see, What's the point? 

As I kept watching my compass and trying to steer the boat towards where I came from, a manly scream was heard in the distance. It was so loud it that I was sure he was on the boat.

""I'm not having any of this, I'm out of here"" 
I spoke with a firm tone and proceeded to lure myself away from all of this torture that I got myself into.

Thinking back, I was doing my job but this zone..it was a weird one with barriers that I perhaps didn't recognise or realise at the time.

As I kept sailing back and forth, I eventually left the zone, utter relief came upon me. I was physically and mentally doing better already.

""This is good...dd"" At the corner of my eye I saw the ship....""No this can't be...But I'm not there anymore!"" 

The clouds fogged and so did my mind, tornados formed and the whistles started...the notebook flew out of the boat like a fish wanting to escape.

The ambience of the devil's homeland truly visible and in full form... reddish glowing in the waves that only proceeded to become bigger and bigger.

A cat as black as the night appeared on my peripheral view on the boat, on the right side...It stared into my soul.

I didn't gather any courage to approach it and then it spoke...yes a cat spoke.
""Leaving? You can't. Not until He has enough fun of keeping you here"" 

I turned around and closed my eyes and prayed that whatever was there would leave me alone... after a bit I felt safer to interact with the world again.

Was the devil keeping me on this thread of torture? 
I was blaming myself for getting into this mess.

The same old chair comforted me whilst I count like all the other times... with the ship spinning around and the whistling every now and then that I try to ignore.

""..1,..2..,3,..3,..2,..1.."" 

Chapter 6

The ocean turned small, I felt alone...and in captivation, the gaze of eyes in the distance, they're shooting glares at me.

""How much more do I have to suffer?
What does He want from me"" 

With my patience being so thin of a rope, I found myself thinking about ending it all.

What's the point of simply existing when you're tight to torture and pain, I know I sound depressing right now but I was back then.

I grabbed the black notebook and threw it in the depths of the ocean with filled frustration and anger. 

Before me a whole opened in the ocean like a black hole and It sucked me, I only remember being dragged in and the waves spinning like a tornado.

Last thing I remember is losing consciousness, only to wake up in an environment with calm waves and darkness surrounding me.

""Uh where am I?"" I asked myself 

I appeared to be on a boat..it had a few torches, anything was barely visible...what dimension or world have I entered? 

""Son, do not worry"" a voice unlike other spoke, It was strange but calmness in it assured me to stop shaking.

I turned right and saw death itself, the one we would draw as kids, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Grim Reaper himself in the boat.

""Wai-tt you're death-hh? I stuttered 
He nodded his head and smiled.

"" Though I'm not here to take you away"".

 Chapter 7

""Unfortunately you're dead but I'm gonna bring you back to life....I think you've seen enough but I need you to do something for me here first"".

I asked "" Yes what is it?""

He slowly adjusted and said "" I got a mission for you in these blackness of waves, find me the notebook that you threw""

I didn't hesitate to answer "" But it's probably not even here? Aren't we in a different place or something?""

He shortly replied whilst patting me 
"" Relax, It's out there somewhere, Go... I'll be with you in the dark""

I reluctantly agreed after being reassured.

And so I started sailing with the boat, Hard to see anything but after a while I could see a ship in the distance.

A shot of nostalgia went through my veins
"" Wait, is this the same ship as the one...no it can't be.""

I heard a voice behind me like a whisper, it was death.
"" Don't worry son, watch out for whistlers, don't look at them or speak to them if you see them look away""

"" Uhmm okay"" I knew by now that he didn't mean harm to me.

As my boat got closer to the ship, the odd smell of human flesh returned to my nose and with the torch in hand I managed to climb my way onto the ship.

"" Everything looks the same""

Death replied 
"" Not everyone""

"" You want me to check the corpses?"" 
I got no response but I had a feeling that's what he meant, through the rotten bones and skulls....one stood out, It had a black book in its mouth.

""Surely it's this one"" 
I grabbed it and left to the boat and sailed away....I called out to death.

""Hey I have it"" 

He appeared
"" very well""
"" Look, how about I return you to the state you were before the mission and please never try the devil's playground again, understood?""

I hesitated  
"" But? 
He interfered immediately 
""No but, just stay out of these waters son"" 

""Okay if you say so, what's in that book even? And who are the Whistlers and the ship with the dead piles of bodies?""

He looked at me and disappeared.

I yelled "" Answer me!""

All I heard was a snap of fingers and I woke up with the alarm clock ringing to my ears....

"" Oh god, here I am, home...

Death: ""Yes son you're here"" 

-Writing-

The first resurfacing of the skin in the pain of the eyes and here he comes to save what's innocent and unprotected.

He smiles and nods day and night... though he cries during midnight.

He carries a wound that's not his, a job nobody would wish for, answers that baffle you aren't for your heart.

Pour me in blood, pile me in the reddish wind of the sky
Drag me across the roads of no return.
I only then shall realise what was worth the most.

The lands of foreigners don't miss you, they don't recall seeing you either. 
Don't cut yourself with a knife, please sleep away with the realm of the world.

I'm newish to espresso but not too new - I have a Meraki that I love and use everyday pulling great shots and not having this issue. 

Moved into a new office so picked up a Barista Pro on a good Black Friday deal to make decent coffee at work but have really been struggling with my milk drinks always having this dry/chalky mouth feel.

I've dialled beans in perfectly getting 36g out in 30seconds, espresso tastes great as a straight shot but as soon as I put milk in to make a flat white, I get this horrible dry mouth aftertaste/sensation which is really ruining the enjoyment of a good drink. The flavour is absolutely fine, I just can't get rid of this dryness.

I've tried lowering the shot temp, reducing shot time a few seconds, speeding it up a few seconds, different beans, milk, water, accessories but just can't work it out.

For reference here's my set up and process:

•	⁠18g in / 36g out / 30 seconds
•	⁠shot temp - middle bar/default setting / have tried cooler temp
•	⁠tried with/without pre infusion
•	⁠using distilled water with third wave water stick added / have also tried normal plain water

1pjhvo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1pjhvo0/it_is_finally_live_and_growing_slowly/,It is finally live and growing slowly,"My first Android app has landed on the Play Store – a fast and sexy weather app called Easy Weather!

I’ve always been annoyed by weather apps that are 40+ MB, ask for every permission, and still shower me with ads. I’m not a dev by day, so I figured : how hard can it be to show a simple forecast? Well, as it turns out, pretty hard.

Started as a weekend side-project: a single-screen app with an OLED-black UI so my AMOLED phone wouldn’t sip battery. Then I got hooked—Kotlin coroutines, WorkManager, adaptive icons, Material You, the whole nine yards. Every new feature meant another rabbit hole.

The toughest part wasn’t the coding, it was everything around it:

* Writing a privacy policy that basically says “I literally collect nothing.”
* Fighting to stay under 15 MB.
* Finding beta testers when your friends all have iPhones.
* Realising Google wants 64-bit, target-SDK 34, scoped storage, adaptive screenshots, a 512×512 hi-res icon, a promo video, a long description, a short description… and don’t forget the feature graphic!

After 18 internal test tracks, 4 closed-alpha builds and one accidental crash that woke me up at 3 am when the console email hit, it’s finally live. (Oh, and Open Meteo had a server problem and all friends and family that had the app installed thought my app stopped working because I am not that good at this).

Play Store link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cognicon.EasyWeather&hl=en\_GB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cognicon.EasyWeather&hl=en_GB)

The app is free, no account, no trackers, no BS. There’s a single ad banner on the main screen—still hesitating if that makes me look greedy because it makes about 3 pence a day in average with AdMob and I hate ads too, so will never put up anything that makes the app look like an advertisement byproduct. After 100+ hours, a bit of coffee money would feel nice, but I also hate paywalls on basic weather.

If you try it, roast me with feedback. I’ve got a backlog full of user requests (radar animation, METAR for pilots, sunrise alerts…) and I’m pushing updates every two weeks.

I’m not excited for this new machine but I wanted some imput on what people like because I see a lot of people loving Nespresso. I’m not sure the intensity of the Melozio but it was soooo strong and I did not like. I even added sugar and creamer and it’s just too strong of a coffee. Basically I like my creamer with a hint of coffee haha. I want to try the sweet vanilla pod but now I’m hesitant 🤣 I just think I need to stick with my ground coffee.

That was a few days ago. They text me every day and I text back, we have also talked on the phone twice since then. 
I just want to text them that I don’t think we’re a match, but I don’t know what to do. I actually feel bad because they’re a really nice person.

I’ve always been annoyed by weather apps that are 40+ MB, ask for every permission, and still shower me with ads. I’m not a dev by day, so I figured : how hard can it be to show a simple forecast?       Well, as it turns out, pretty hard.

Started as a weekend side-project: a single-screen app with an OLED-black UI so my AMOLED phone wouldn’t sip battery. Then I got hooked—Kotlin coroutines, WorkManager, adaptive icons, Material You, the whole nine yards. Every new feature meant another rabbit hole.

The toughest part wasn’t the coding, it was everything around it:

* Writing a privacy policy that basically says “I literally collect nothing.”
* Fighting to stay under 15 MB.
* Finding beta testers when your friends all have iPhones.
* Realising Google wants 64-bit, target-SDK 34, scoped storage, adaptive screenshots, a 512×512 hi-res icon, a promo video, a long description, a short description… and don’t forget the feature graphic!

After 18 internal test tracks, 4 closed-alpha builds and one accidental crash that woke me up at 3 am when the console email hit, it’s finally live. (Oh, and Open Meteo had a server problem and all friends and family that had the app installed thought my app stopped working because I am not that good at this).

Play Store link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cognicon.EasyWeather&hl=en\_GB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cognicon.EasyWeather&hl=en_GB)

The app is free, no account, no trackers, no BS. There’s a single ad banner on the main screen—still hesitating if that makes me look greedy because it makes about 3 pence a day in average with AdMob and I hate ads too, so will never put up anything that makes the app look like an advertisement byproduct. After 100+ hours, a bit of coffee money would feel nice, but I also hate paywalls on basic weather.

If you try it, roast me with feedback. I’ve got a backlog full of user requests (radar animation, METAR for pilots, sunrise alerts…) and I’m pushing updates every two weeks.
