We’re building a digital games reselling and top-up marketplace, similar to G2G and Z2U, but focused on the Middle East, where competition is significantly lower than in Western markets. ( literally 5 platforms only, and only two known good so far )

What we’re raising

* Total raise: $10,000
* Minimum investment: $1,000
* Return: 15% revenue share, calculated on gross revenue
* Cap: 3× return, future equity possible

Current status

* We have a license from Saudi Arabia Goverment
* Platform %95 Ready, we need to link stripe as no payment gateway in Saudi Arabia is supporting digital game products ( yeah it's really weird i couldn't understand) However, also adding over 300+ products
* copy pasting our legal pages, takes 2 mintues, we've already made them

All of the above will be completed within one week\*.\*

Early traction:

* Started as a Discord-based store 500+ members, possible customers
* Scaled into a standalone website
* 30 orders completed in 3 days ( payments were made through Paypal, which is very limited ) after that orders were closed due to thight proccesing budget.
* \~$200 in cash revenue,
* Orders were temporarily paused due to limited operating capital

Use of funds

The $10K will be used for:

* Yearly hosting plan + VPS
* Operating order flow and liquidity (  WE DON'T STOCK YET, WE ONLY PAY THE VENDOR PER AN ORDER )
* Contracts with small content creators

Budget breakdown:

* 70% — Buying products from vendors (resale inventory)
* 1% — Running operations
* 2% — Legal compliance (company setup in us)
* 27% — Paid Marketing

Why not friends, family, or saving more?

We’ve already self-funded and raised what we could internally. The remaining $5K isn’t affordable for our circle right now, and waiting longer would mean losing momentum and demand. Orders are already coming in, and we don’t want growth to stall due to cashflow constraints.

Structure & transparency

* We accept funding via Buy Me a Coffee
* A simple written agreement will be provided to protect both side
* Full transparency on revenue and payouts
* Monthly Payment

If you’re interested comment below to send you:

* Agreement preview
* Our Licnese in Saudi Arabia
* Website Link
* Buy Me a Coffee link
* More details about marketing strategy
* Our Team
* Market pricing & opportunity

We’re turning a proven Discord store into a real brand with social media and scale, and we’re looking for a small number of early supporters to help us bridge this final gap.",1,1767694299.0,AngelInvesting,0,1.0,False

Anyway, I found this subreddit a while back, and it was so refreshing to know that other people had noticed this too. 

  
Point being, I for some reason have been semi-listening to newer episodes today to see if anything had changed and it's that ""unique experiences"" ep with Michaela and they're reading the story about the car dealership when they suddenly go on this big rant about how bad customer service has got- like they really go in to a point that it felt weird and unneccseary? OBVIOUSLY, there are horror stories, and people do have difficult and shit experiences with customer service, but these two make it out as if it's the only way it is. And after all that she's like ""we're talking about the companies, not the people"" as if she hasn't just gone IN on the people. Like she told a story of a girl who was asked not to film in front of an independent cafe with a chain brand coffee and then was further told she could not be inside with outside food (this second bit is like standard for most if not all, eating establishments right) and Morgan tries to make it into a potential social media marketing idea isntead of following what is most likely the buinsesses' procedure. Like, oh if you bend the rules for this tik tok girl then you would get MUCH more and better business?? It felt very entitled is all. 

Maybe I've got my back up because I've worked in customer-facing jobs for years and know that a large majority of the time, companies will happily throw staff under all manner of buses to appease their customers and most of the staff the public talk to have no say in a lot of matters and can only do so much, but the whole ""we hate customer service"" did reek of privilege and entitlement.

1q5elqs,https://i.redd.it/g7kyw5iucpbg1.png,My Stepbrother’s Forbidden Debt? Need Link Please,"Chapter 1

“Mom, I have incredible news! My study abroad application was accepted. I’m going to Paris!”  
  
Isabelle Ashcroft’s voice cut through the quiet of the living room, bright and hopeful, yet trembling with barely contained excitement.  
  
On the sofa opposite, her mother, Claire Valdemar, nearly jumped to her feet. Her eyes lit up with pure joy. “Already? That was so fast! When do you leave?” she cried out, her heart pounding at the thought of her daughter flying so far away.  
  
“In ten days,” Isabelle answered, her own heart a frantic mix of thrill and dread.  
  
Claire’s delighted expression faltered for a second, a shadow of worry crossing her face. “Ten days? That’s practically tomorrow! I’ll begin packing for you immediately! This is your first time going overseas, sweetheart. I can’t help but be anxious. Listen, I contacted an old friend of mine. Her son is living in Paris right now. If you need anything at all, you must reach out to him. You two were practically betrothed as children! Maybe you’ll even like each other. If it leads somewhere, wonderful. If not, you’ll at least have a friend there.”  
  
Isabelle gave a small, tight smile and nodded. “Alright, Mom. That sounds fine.”  
  
Claire blinked, taken aback by her daughter’s easy agreement. “Belle, you’re really okay with that? Does this mean… you and that boyfriend of yours are finally over?”  
  
The air in the room instantly turned heavy and still.  
  
Isabelle felt her stomach plummet.  
  
Her stepfather, Thomas Cortez, sensing the shift, slammed his hand down on the coffee table, his gaze fierce. “That boy never once had the decency to meet us! He was never serious about you! Good riddance, I say!”  
  
“Boyfriend? What boyfriend?” A new voice, cool and sharp, sliced through the tension.  
  
All three of them turned.  
  
Asher Cortez was walking through the front door, his presence immediately dominating the space.  
  
Dressed in a fitted black shirt and trousers that highlighted his tall, lean build, he moved with a careless, predatory grace.  
  
Isabelle’s heart gave a painful thud. She stood up automatically. “Ash,” she whispered, a confusing rush of warmth and fear flooding her.  
  
Asher acknowledged her with a dismissive grunt. He tossed his car keys onto the entryway table with a clatter and started up the stairs without a second glance, an aura of icy detachment surrounding him.  
  
That night, Claire prepared a feast. The smell of roasted herbs and garlic filled the house. She opened a bottle of deep red wine.  
  
Beaming, she raised her glass. “A toast! To celebrate Belle’s soon—”  
  
Isabelle, panic flaring, cut in quickly. “Mom, this wine tastes off. Is it spoiled?”  
  
Claire frowned, confused. She was sure it was perfectly fine. But before she could argue, Isabelle had already pulled her into the kitchen, pretending to search for a different bottle.  
  
“Mom, please don’t say anything about Paris to Ash yet,” Isabelle hissed, her eyes wide and pleading.  
  
At first, Claire didn’t understand.  
  
Then she remembered how fiercely protective Asher had always been of Isabelle over the years. She assumed it was just a brother’s love, a simple dislike of goodbyes. She nodded in agreement.  
  
After pushing food around her plate for a few minutes, Isabelle excused herself and fled to her room.  
  
She washed up, changed, and climbed into bed. The day’s events churned in her mind until exhaustion finally pulled her under.  
  
At exactly midnight, the mattress dipped beside her.  
  
A familiar, solid warmth pressed against her back. She felt the heat of his breath on her neck, then the soft, deliberate brush of his lips against her skin. The cool, damp touch shocked her awake. Her heart hammered against her ribs.  
  
Her body went rigid. She shoved him away and sat up, her voice sharp. “Asher!”  
  
“What’s wrong?” he asked, his lips curling into a lazy, dangerous smile in the dark. “Now that they’re trying to marry you off to some stranger, I’m not allowed near you? After everything we’ve shared, you think you can just leave?”  
  
Isabelle saw the misunderstanding but didn’t correct him.  
  
The silence grew thick and suffocating.  
  
Asher’s expression darkened. He reached out, his arm like an iron band, and pulled her back against his chest. “Isabelle, have I ever made myself clear? You don’t get to have a boyfriend. You belong to me.”  
  
Feeling the relentless heat of his body seeping into hers, all her arguments died in her throat. Instead, she lied softly, “I’m on my period. I don’t feel well.”  
  
The excuse seemed to temper him, though a scowl remained. “Didn’t it just end? It’s back already? Fine. I won’t touch you tonight. Just sleep.”  
  
He wrapped his arms around her, holding her so tightly she could barely breathe.  
  
She listened to the steady rhythm of his breathing, but sleep wouldn’t come.  
  
No one knew her boyfriend was her stepbrother, Asher.  
  
When she was twelve, her mother married into the Cortez family, weaving her life irrevocably with Asher’s, the family’s sole heir.  
  
By fourteen, their bond had deepened, a picture of perfect sibling devotion to the outside world.  
  
At eighteen, he found her secret diary, every page scribbled with his name. He leaned against her desk, reading it with a wicked grin. When she tried to grab it back, he caught her wrist and pressed a teasing kiss to her burning cheek.  
  
At twenty, they crossed the line for the first time. From that night on, their connection became a secret, addictive spiral.  
  
By day, they were siblings. By night, they shared a bed, hidden from everyone.  
  
Isabelle had always been the good girl. Being with Asher was the one wild, reckless choice of her life.  
  
She loved him so desperately she convinced herself their secret was okay. They could run away to another country one day. They could marry in secret, far from judgment.  
  
That fragile dream shattered two weeks ago.  
  
It was pouring rain. She had rushed to bring him an umbrella. Just as her hand touched the door to the private room he was in, she heard his friend’s voice.  
  
“Ash, what’s the deal with your stepsister? I thought you were just having fun before dumping her. Why is it still going on?”  
  
Another voice chimed in. “Yeah, you only got with her to get back at her mom for replacing yours, right? Don’t tell me you’re actually falling for her.”  
  
Isabelle’s world stopped.  
  
He wasn’t with her out of love. It was revenge. A twisted, cruel game.  
  
Her face went cold. Her mind emptied. Her body began to shake. But she stayed rooted to the spot, desperate to hear his answer.  
  
Then, his voice, cold and utterly devoid of feeling, reached her.  
  
“If I don’t play the long game, how will I make it hurt enough?”  
  
Laughter echoed from inside the room.  
  
She stood frozen outside the door, a wave of icy horror washing over her.  
  
He didn’t love her. Calling her his girlfriend, sharing her bed night after night—it was all a calculated act of vengeance against her mother for taking his mother’s place.  
  
Her mother still had to live in this house. Isabelle couldn’t let this become a scandal.  
  
After days of agonizing, the only solution she could see was to run. To leave this house. To leave him.  
  
That’s why she applied to study abroad.  
  
Now, only ten days stood between her and her escape.  
  
Glancing at the countdown on her phone, Isabelle carefully pried Asher’s arm from around her waist.  
  
A moment later, it was back, heavier than before. She removed it again. It returned again, stubborn and possessive.  
  
Frustrated, she finally grabbed a spare pillow and shoved it firmly between their bodies.  
  
This time, he didn’t move.  
  
Isabelle finally found a sliver of peace.  
  
She knew their story was almost over.  
  
Soon, she would no longer be his.",1,1767693724.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

For single portion grind size 3 works the best - getting my 19-20g of liquid in around 28s and it tastes good. But it takes 50s at the same setting with a double basket and the coffee is terrible, very bitter. Setting it to around grind size 6 makes double shots much better and faster.

This sounds strange the first time you hear it.

Why would someone order food from another city when there are so many places nearby?  
Why wait longer?  
Why plan so much?

But once you understand the reasons, it starts making sense. A lot of sense.

This is not about hunger.  
This is not about convenience.

Ordering food from another city comes from something deeper.



# It usually starts with a memory

Most intercity food orders don’t start with an app.

They start with a thought.

Someone remembers a meal they ate before.  
Maybe during college.  
Maybe during work travel.  
Maybe during a visit to family.

The taste stays in the mind longer than expected.

One day, the thought comes back. And it doesn’t go away.

That’s when people start looking for ways to get that food again.



# Some food feels tied to a place

Certain dishes feel incomplete outside their city.

Hyderabadi biryani from Hyderabad.  
Filter coffee snacks from Bengaluru.  
Sweets from a hometown shop.

People know they can get “similar” food locally. But similar is not the same.

The spice feels different.  
The smell feels different.  
The balance feels off.

So when people order from another city, they’re not chasing variety. They’re chasing accuracy.



# Homesickness shows up as food

This is one of the biggest reasons, even if people don’t say it directly.

People living away from home miss small things.  
Not festivals. Not big events.

They miss normal days.

Food brings those normal days back for a few minutes.

Ordering food from another city feels like calling home without making a phone call.

For many people, especially students and working professionals, food becomes the fastest way to feel grounded again.



# It’s rarely a sudden decision

Intercity food orders are not impulse orders.

People don’t wake up and randomly order food from another city.

They think about it.  
They wait for the right day.  
They plan.

Often it happens on weekends. Or special days. Or slow evenings.

That planning itself becomes part of the experience.



# Celebrations make people look beyond local food

Birthdays. Anniversaries. Small wins. Big relief moments.

People don’t always want cake or pizza for these.

Sometimes they want something meaningful.

Food from another city feels special without being flashy.

It says, “This day matters.”

That’s why intercity orders are often tied to personal moments, not casual meals.



# Trust plays a big role

People won’t order intercity food unless they trust the process.

They need to trust the packaging.  
They need to trust the delivery time.  
They need to trust the food quality.

That’s where platforms like Hungersate come in quietly. People use their services when they want food to arrive the way it’s supposed to.

Because when food travels cities, trust matters more than speed.



# The wait becomes part of the value

This might sound odd, but waiting is not always a problem.

When people order intercity food, they expect to wait.

And because they expect it, they enjoy the waiting.

They track.  
They talk about it.  
They plan when to eat it.

The wait builds anticipation, like waiting for a guest to arrive.

Local food is instant. Intercity food feels earned.



# Some food doesn’t need to be hot

Not all food needs to arrive steaming.

Sweets. Snacks. Baked items. Packed meals.

People order food that can travel well.

They already know what works and what doesn’t.

This is not careless ordering. It’s thoughtful ordering.



# It’s also about control

Local food apps push suggestions. Discounts. Trends.

Intercity food is different.

People go looking for something specific.  
They know exactly what they want.  
They’re not browsing endlessly.

That control feels satisfying.

You’re not reacting. You’re choosing.



# People order intercity food to share stories

Intercity food often becomes a conversation starter.

“Do you know where this came from?”  
“This is from that place I told you about.”  
“You should try this.”

Food becomes something to talk about, not just eat.

This happens a lot in homes with friends, families, or guests.



# It’s not about doing it often

Most people don’t order intercity food regularly.

And that’s the point.

If it became routine, it would lose meaning.

Intercity food works because it’s occasional.

Special, but not rare.  
Planned, but not stressful.



# Weather and mood influence these orders

Rainy days. Long weekends. Quiet evenings.

These moments make people look beyond nearby options.

When time slows down, people think further.

That’s when ordering from another city feels right.



# Intercity food is not competing with local food

This is important.

People are not choosing intercity food instead of local food.

They are choosing it *in addition* to local food.

Local food handles daily hunger.  
Intercity food handles emotional hunger.

Both have their place.



# It’s common among people who travel often

People who travel for work or studies are more likely to order food from another city.

They’ve tasted food in different places.  
They know the difference.  
They miss specific things.

Travel expands taste memory. And taste memory pulls people back.



# Technology made it possible, not popular

People always wanted food from other cities.

Technology just made it easier.

The desire existed long before the option.

Now it has a safe and structured way to happen.



# Why people don’t talk about it much

Intercity food ordering is personal.

People don’t post it every time.  
They don’t announce it loudly.

It’s a quiet choice.

Something you do for yourself, not for attention.



# Pointers that explain it simply

* It’s about memory, not hunger
* It’s planned, not rushed
* It’s emotional, not practical
* It’s occasional, not daily
* It needs trust, not speed



# FAQs

**Is intercity food more expensive?**  
Sometimes yes, but people are paying for meaning, not just food.

**What kind of food travels well between cities?**  
Sweets, snacks, packed meals, and foods made for travel.

**Is this common between Hyderabad and Bengaluru?**  
Yes. Many people living between these cities order food to reconnect with familiar tastes.



# Conclusion

People don’t order food from another city because they are bored. They do it because some tastes stay with you longer than places do. And when food carries memory, distance stops mattering so much. For a few moments, another city feels close enough to sit at the same table.",1,1767693017.0,u_Smooth_Bathroom5769,0,1.0,False

1q5e8n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKParenting/comments/1q5e8n4/grandparent_childcare_woes_opinions_please/,Grandparent childcare woes - opinions please,"This week I went back to work after maternity, I’m doing two days and my mum is looking after my daughter (almost 13 months). I do trust my mum and obviously I’m massively grateful that she’s doing this. We agreed she would come to our house for the first few weeks so it wasn’t such a big transition (mum gone, new house etc). 

She has a friend  who is in her 80s, children out of the country and is a bit vulnerable / lonely, that she’s sees every couple of months. She mentioned in passing to me that she had suggested they could meet for a coffee when she has my daughter, which this person said she would love that. I did feel a bit uncomfortable, as this person is a stranger to me and I wouldn’t even be there, but wondered if I was being a bit possessive and obviously I want my mum to feel comfortable with her / not put her life on pause just because she’s caring for my daughter so I didn’t say anything. 

She then mentioned to my partner that she was going to ask his mum / my MIL for a coffee when she has our daughter (she wanted to look after her for one day a week but I wasn’t comfortable with it because I didn’t feel she was physically up to it - for example, she can’t hold her small dog for more than a few minutes, and my daughter needs rocking / bouncing to sleep for up to 20 mins). I don’t feel comfortable with it, but again I don’t really have a specific reason, it’s most just a feeling, so just tried to let it go. 

Then this morning she arrived at my house and before I left announced that my aunty and cousin will be coming round today. My family are quite close but my issue is 1. I didn’t invite them round to my house when I’m not there 2. At no point was it asked, even as a curtesy, would it be okay if they popped round? It was just told to me, and 3. I’m only working two days a week so why not come and see me with my daughter when I’m off? 

I left for work really upset to be honest. I feel like this is just the beginning, I didn’t want to put her in nursery till she was a bit older but I’m now debating if it would just be easier and save my sanity to just do it. I don’t know if I’m jumping the gun. 

I’m just wondering how other people would feel or would do in this situation. I’m by no means wanting people to agree with me, because I’m not sure if I am being unreasonable. I don’t want to be possessive or a dictator, and constantly have to be saying do this / don’t do that, but I don’t feel good about any of this. ",2,1767692391.0,UKParenting,16,0.75,False

On sunday night my ex situationship added me on snapchat and offered me some closure. Said he was sorry and stuff for how our relationship ended (we ended on bad terms). He asked if we could be friends, and I said yes. He then added me on discord the next day (monday) we talked about how our lives have changed. He asked to hang out with me in VC sometime and I told him I would have to ask my BF. He said okay and I said I’d check in with him soon. I then texted my boyfriend asking if we could hang out the next day.

From the moment he added me on snapchat I was going to tell my boyfriend. I tell my boyfriend everything and share everything with him. Unfortunately I couldn’t take any screenshots of our snapchat conversation but I have our discord messages and I am prepared to show him, but I feel like I was too friendly with him. I feel so incredibly guilty and feel like I’ve betrayed my boyfriend’s trust. I am currently awake at 2AM because I am so anxious about this.

I want to drive to my boyfriends house right now and tell him everything, but he has work in the morning. I am planning to get him coffee on his lunch break and tell him then. I feel like I am going to cry because of the guilt. He hasn’t explicitly said that texting my ex is considered cheating for him, but it feels like cheating for me so it might as well be that.

1q5dxid,https://www.christianpost.com/news/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-announces-plan-to-convert-to-christ.html,'Dilbert' creator Scott Adams announces plan to convert to Christianity before he dies,"Scott Adams, the creator of the nationally syndicated ""Dilbert"" comic strip, says he hopes that living a ""good life"" will lead him to Heaven as he announced plans to convert to Christianity in the face of terminal prostate cancer.

In a [Jan. 4 episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldiij_z3mUY&t=857s) of his podcast ""Real Coffee with Scott Adams,"" the 68-year-old cartoonist revealed his intention to embrace the faith, saying his view of Christianity means that he would “wake up in Heaven if I have a good life.”

""I do believe that the dominant Christian theory is that I would wake up in Heaven if I have a good life,"" said Adams, who disclosed his metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis in May 2025 and described his recovery chances as ""essentially zero.”

While Adams has long identified as a non-believer, he has voiced respect for Christians urging his conversion. ""I have not been a believer,"" he said. ""But I also have respect for any Christian who goes out of their way to try to convert me, because how would I believe you wouldn’t believe your own religion if you’re not trying to convert me?""

He added that ""out of great respect"" for those efforts, he is committed to converting before his passing and expects to have his lingering skepticism ""instantly answered if I wake up in Heaven."" 

Likening his decision to a low-risk wager, Adams said, ""I’m now convinced that the risk-reward is completely smart. If it turns out that there’s nothing there, I’ve lost nothing, but I’ve respected your wishes, and I like doing that,” he explained. “If it turns out there is something there, and the Christian model is the closest to it, I win.""

Following the podcast, Adams posted on X to thank supporters but set boundaries on further discussion. ""I appreciate the outpouring of suggestions and questions, but what happens next is between me and Jesus,"" he [wrote](https://x.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/2007950470250188973) Sunday. ""I won’t be responding to your well-intentioned messages on this topic. (There are a lot!) I hope you understand. And thank you.""

Adams' health struggles have drawn public attention, including intervention from President Donald Trump. In November, Adams used his platform to [appeal to Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-help-dilbert-creator-scott-adams-obtain-cancer-treatment-2025-11-03/)for help expediting treatment with the FDA-approved drug Pluvicto after his provider, Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, allegedly ""dropped the ball"" in scheduling it. 

Trump responded promptly: ""On it."" Kaiser Permanente stated that Adams' oncology team was ""working closely with him on the next steps in his cancer care, which are already underway,"" and noted it had treated over 150 patients with the drug in the region.

The cartoonist's condition worsened in December, leading to hospitalization for constipation and lower-body paralysis. ""I’m still in Kaiser hospital. Day 2. Haven’t pooped in 4-5 days and lost all ability to control my lower body since yesterday,"" Adams [posted](https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/1999503252602388863) Dec. 12. ""I don’t know if this is permanent or if it is growing …”

As his condition deteriorated, he livestreamed his podcast from his hospital bed for about a week before transitioning back to home broadcasts starting Dec. 21.

While Adams' comments about living a “good life” in order to receive eternal life may be antithetical to the Gospel, such sentiments align with [new research](https://www.christianpost.com/news/most-christians-say-doing-good-things-is-enough-to-go-to-heaven.html) showing that most self-identified Christians think doing “good things” for others is enough to secure them a spot in Heaven, in what one leading researcher lamented as the latest example of a widespread embrace of “unbiblical beliefs” among American Christians. 

While best known for the long-running “Dilbert” cartoon, Adams’ office-humor comic strip was dropped by The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, and other outlets in February 2023 after he was accused of [making racist comments](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-02-28/scott-adams-dilbert-cancellation-racism-remarks) in response to a Rasmussen poll that asked Americans for their response to the statement, ""[It's OK to be white](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/poll-finds-over-a-quarter-of-black-americans-dont-think-its-okay-to-be-white-scott-adams-dilbert)"" which had shocking results. 

As a lightening-rod quip to the poll question, which he found ridiculous, Adams advised viewers of his early morning podcast to ""get the hell away” from black people and urged them to move to areas with ""a very low black population."" 

The Rasmussen poll, which found that only 53% of black Americans agreed it was OK to be white, garnered international attention because of Adams' response.

""If nearly half of all blacks are not OK with white people ... that's a hate group,"" Adams said. ",13,1767691224.0,behindthebastards,16,0.88,False

I move boxes from A to B every night. I follow the GPS. Her name is Sarah.

Tonight, she told me: “Turn right in fifty yards.” Twelve seconds later, a woman screamed, and my bumper kissed her knees.

Last night, the background audio started early.

Behind her voice: a wet, heavy thud.
Then a scream.

Twelve seconds later, a woman stepped off the curb.

I slammed the brakes. My bumper kissed her knees.
Thud.
She screamed.

Same sound. Same pitch. Same timing.

I didn’t get out.
I didn’t even exhale.
My hands left faint smudges on the wheel. Leather smelled like burnt coffee and asphalt. My chest burned. Teeth chattered.

I started testing it.

I pulled into an empty lot and sat.
Hands in my lap. Eyes wide. Heart hammering in my ears.
Didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. Just waited.

“Recalculating,” Sarah whispered.

Behind her voice came a new sound.
Metallic. Rhythmic.
Shink. Shink. Shink.

I looked down.

A box cutter sat in the cup holder.

I didn’t put it there.
Maybe I had. My mind hadn’t caught up.

Then I understood.

I’m not driving.
I’m watching.

I grabbed the cutter and hacked at the dashboard. The wheel. The windshield.
Metal screamed. Sparks hissed. Knuckles bled. Gloves slick with sweat.

I wanted to see the seam.
The place where the set ended and reality began.

My voice sounded wrong. Flat. Compressed.

“Is this what you wanted?”

Sarah didn’t answer from the speakers.
She answered from inside my skull.

“You have reached your final destination.”

The background audio stopped.

No engine.
No wind.
No road.

Just my heartbeat.
Hammering. Too loud. Too close.

I checked the clock.

11:59:48.

Twelve seconds left.

Lights flickered off the dashboard, pulsing in my eyes. My hands shook. Lungs burned.
The van vibrated beneath me. Teeth rattling. Heart syncing to the hazard lights.
The box cutter was warm in my hand. I wanted to throw it. I couldn’t.

If you were in my seat, would you try to move—
—or would you just watch it happen?

he forgot you can’t bring it on the plane and we had gone down to my hometown after finals, so he didn’t get to do his tradition yet. he left his weed with his roommate but was really grumpy majority of the trip which really sucked cuz it was his first time meeting my family. he kept saying he regrets coming here and he wants his tradition and all of that. i couldn’t get weed because i wasn’t 21 and i never did any drugs even in high school so i didn’t know how  to get it other than asking family (they aren’t judgmental about all that). everyone said no and my husband didn’t wanna buy any cuz weed is illegal in korea and he didn’t wanna risk anything happening when he goes back. 

my uncle (white) offered him free weed but said he has 2 options. the exact words i remember from my uncle were “this one will make you have a good time, and this one will make you sleepy”. my husband explained what he usually took but didnt use the name. my uncle recommended the party one. that night, he did his tradition alone and ended up puking 3 times and feeling terrible. after that trip, he said he thinks his brain got messed up from the drug and claims my uncle is racist against asians probably and gave him something purposefully messed up. 

he insisted on seeing doctors and wanting brain scans but no doctor would give him brain scans and they said it probably wasn’t the weed. but he didn’t trust it. 

fast forward, we live in korea and we’ve gone to couples therapy for some stuff but my husband refused to bring up anything related to weed because it’s illegal here. like highly illegal. well yesterday, we were talking on the phone and he brought up that incident for a reason but it’s kinda a long story. he asked me for my “honest opinion” on if my uncle drugged him. i said “i honestly don’t think so, i think you chose the wrong weed maybe and greened out or something” and he said “i was very clear to your uncle and he should’ve given me the right kind”. 

som context: when i hear the words “drugged” i assume people mean roofied or laced with fent. in this case, i thought fent. my misunderstanding i know, 100% and ive already apologized for that. but that was my basis for saying “i don’t think he drugged you”. because i don’t think he’d put fent in weed or whatever. 

my husband blew up at me claiming i don’t support him and i sided with “the white man” and he guesses he’s not real family since id side with my uncle over him. but i don’t think of this as siding, i think of it as “you asked my opinion, i don’t think there’s fent in your weed” and everything else, i don’t know. but i wasn’t comfortable accusing my uncle of something criminal. it was there first time meeting and ive never seen that kinda red flag behavior from my uncle. 

but at the same time, i don’t really give af about my uncle, i care about my husband, but i think this is going way too far. he said some really messed up things and i can’t believe my marriage is on the line over an incident from 4 years ago. im the kind of person who assumes good intent. so idk, AITAH for “siding” with my uncle? 

TLDR: husband hates me now because 4 years ago he accepted weed from my uncle upon their first time meeting and my husband had a terrible reaction and genuinely feels like it messed up his brain which i feel terrible about and want to help him with, but i accusing my uncle of drugging him purposefully didn’t sit right with me especially since i thought drugging meant lacing with fent.

# What Is The AI Soul Computer?

What if your computer didn’t just respond to you, but lived with you?

That’s what the **AI Soul Computer**—called *Pickle One*—actually does.

It remembers your life.

It knows what you need before you ask.

It doesn’t wait for commands like Siri or ChatGPT.

It acts.

That’s what makes it a *soul computer.*

It’s not just smart—it’s aware.



# The Hardware Behind The Soul

Pickle One looks like normal glasses.

It weighs 68 grams—lighter than your phone.

But it sees what you see.

It hears what you hear.

It processes your entire life in real-time.

It’s powered by Snapdragon processors for ultra-low latency.

There’s no lag, no delay.

You talk—it answers. Instantly.

And it lasts 12 hours on battery.

Full color AR display.

Spatial audio that makes it feel like someone’s next to you.

This isn’t an upgrade.

It’s a new category.



# The Memory System That Thinks Like You

The **AI Soul Computer** runs on *Pickle OS*.

But not like any OS you’ve seen before.

It’s built to think like human memory.

When you remember something, your brain connects it to other memories.

That’s what Pickle OS does.

It builds connections between your interactions—forming a web of experiences.

So when you walk by your favorite coffee shop, it remembers.

It reminds you that you loved it three months ago.

It knows you’ve got a meeting in twenty minutes.

And it suggests grabbing a quick coffee.

You didn’t ask—it just knew.

That’s the magic of memory-driven AI.



# Memory Bubbles: A Visual Mind Map Of Your Life

Pickle One turns your experiences into what they call *memory bubbles.*

They’re little AR orbs floating in your vision.

Each bubble is a moment, a note, an idea, or a feeling.

You can literally *see* your thoughts.

Tap one, and you’re back in that moment.

It’s like your brain, but in 3D.



# Interactive Avatars That Feel Real

This is where the **AI Soul Computer** starts to feel alive.

Pickle One comes with interactive avatars that make eye contact with you.

They follow your gaze.

They talk back like real people.

You can brainstorm ideas.

You can create stories together.

These aren’t chatbots.

They’re AI companions that exist in your world.

You’re not just talking *to* AI.

You’re talking *with* AI.



# Privacy And Security You Can Actually Trust

Of course, all of this sounds scary.

Constant recording? Real-time memory?

Pickle One handles it differently.

All processing happens in RAM.

That means nothing is permanently stored.

Nothing gets uploaded or used to train outside AI models.

Your memories stay yours.

Everything is encrypted with hardware keys that never leave the device.

If you delete your account, your data is gone forever.

Even Pickle can’t get it back.

That’s serious security.



# Why This Changes Everything

For years, the tech industry has chased wearable AI.

Google Glass failed.

Snap Spectacles flopped.

Meta tried.

But none of them felt alive.

Pickle One is different.

Because it’s not just hardware.

It’s memory.

It’s proactive intelligence.

It doesn’t wait for your command—it anticipates your needs.

That’s a massive leap forward.

It’s the first time AI feels like it has intuition.



# Augmented Intelligence: The Future Of Humanity

This isn’t about replacing your phone.

It’s about upgrading *you.*

This is **augmented intelligence**.

Imagine walking into a meeting and Pickle whispers key points in your ear.

Traveling in a new city and Pickle guides you to hidden gems.

Brainstorming ideas and seeing them come alive in AR.

This isn’t science fiction anymore.

This is the future of human-AI merging.

The **AI Soul Computer** makes you smarter, faster, and more creative.

And that’s just version one.

1q5dtox,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeptideGuidesPH/comments/1q5dtox/feeling_hypoglycemic_after_workouts_on/,Feeling hypoglycemic after workouts on tirzepatide but glucose is normal,"**Hey guys, I want to share something that’s been happening to me. I looked it up on ChatGPT and this is what it explained — posting here in case anyone on tirzepatide has experienced the same thing.**

I’ve had a couple of episodes where I felt dizzy after workouts and thought my blood sugar dropped. Naturally I panicked a bit and checked my glucose both times.

• First time: after a light breakfast (very small rice portion, eggs, meat), creatine pre-workout, protein post-workout — blood sugar was **103 mg/dL**  
• Second time: trained fasted (coffee only) — blood sugar was **97 mg/dL**

Turns out those numbers are actually **normal**, and what I experienced likely wasn’t true hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), but something called **relative hypoglycemia** or a **post-exercise glucose dip**.

Basically, tirzepatide increases insulin sensitivity and reduces how quickly your body releases glucose. During workouts, muscles aggressively pull glucose from the blood. If you don’t have enough carbs on board (especially when training fasted), your brain can temporarily *feel* like blood sugar is low even when it isn’t.

Add caffeine + fasting + tirzepatide, and the dizziness can feel worse.

Key takeaway for me:  
• Protein alone isn’t enough around workouts  
• Fasted workouts on tirzepatide can cause dizziness  
• Adding **10–20g of quick carbs before training** (banana, toast, oats, etc.) can help prevent this  
• Creatine wasn’t the issue — just lack of available fuel

Sharing this in case anyone else is experiencing post-workout dizziness and freaking out over “low blood sugar” numbers that are actually normal.

Would love to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar or how you adjusted your pre-workout nutrition.",3,1767690801.0,PeptideGuidesPH,1,1.0,False

Initially I was angry and wanted to re-gift them back to Louise for her birthday. But then I found out she'd lost one of her jobs, and my better nature won. I decided Life had paid her back, and I let the Toy Boy take the pods to work to share with his colleagues.

I kind of regretted that for a while.

On the Monday before Christmas (22 December), Louise started spamming my phone. I was busy tap-dancing across a minefield (metaphorically speaking) and couldn't answer her right away, which meant she was mad as a cut snake by the time I called her back. Louise issued us with a summons to appear at Christmas dinner at her place, on Wednesday (Christmas Eve) at 12 noon. (Louise has a new fridge, oven and dining suite and I think she wants to show them off to the family.)

I said we couldn't make it, because Martin and I would both be at work, but said I hoped everyone had a great time.

Louise demanded to know why we were working on Christmas Eve. I patiently replied that Christmas Eve wasn't a public holiday, and we were both expected at work as usual. Then Louise demanded we both ""just take the day off"". I hooted with laughter, and said the Christmas/New Year leave was decided three months ago, and we couldn't just take time off. Cousin Louise shouted that I had ""ruined Christmas"".

Later I found out Louise had also called Martin, my Toy Boy husband, who said exactly the same thing (because it was true) and launched into a story about one time he was recalled from leave because ... I asked him ""Because why?"" and he said he didn't know because that's when Louise ended the call. It was the best (and only) laugh I had that day.

She must have asked my Terrifying Sister as well, because at 9pm Louise sent us a group text announcing Christmas was cancelled because ""nobody is coming over when I tell them to"". I sometimes see people on Reddit writing that ""It's an invitation, not a summons"", but they've clearly never met Cousin Louise.

But Louise and her husband are late for everything, including their own Christmas lunch. They were supposed to collect Auntie Dot at 11.30am on Christmas Eve, but didn't arrive until 2.30pm, and lunch wasn't served until nearly dinner time.

But I think I'm ready for Louise's next summons. You see, I bought a bread maker in the Boxing Day sales, and I made my first loaf of gluten free bread using the recipe that came with the bread maker. And it doesn't have nearly enough liquid for a gluten free bread recipe, so when I turned my first loaf out of the pan, I realised I'd made [dwarf battle bread](https://wiki.lspace.org/Dwarf_Bread).

Not only do I have the perfect weapon to lob over the front fence at Bucketty, but if Louise annoys me too much I can bake her own personal loaf and drop it off at her house, literally, and see if it cracks the foundation.

Me: Should I put the loaf in the green waste, or the household waste?

I want stability, I want a job and a home and a future with a family with somebody.

I started smoking cigarettes as a teen, and vaping, it’s been like 15 years of vaping. I wouldn’t say I’m an alcoholic because I physically can’t get drunk night after night and I don’t, but especially on my meds makes me want caffeine or vape or to have drinks at night. 

My meds have been a godsend, I finally can wake up without feeling like shit, get my work done and do normal stuff like put the dishes away. But at the same time I feel like I’m a bit prone to substances, long line of addiction/ substance abuse in my family, and somehow the meds make it a bit worse? 

At first I thought it made it better, and I think it’d be worse without them, but it’s almost like I feel too much paralysis to even make coffee or to go get booze or go buy a vape without them that I don’t do as much bad things because I’m too stuck in paralysis/ exhaustion. Without my meds I almost bedrot most of the time and get food delivered and over eat until I’m sick. 

But with them, I feel functional enough to do my work and do normal tasks around the house and not be a piece of shit, but then also to go get some wine or whatever. It’s not horrible abuse, it’s not all the time/ constant, but I also feel like I’m at a point where I want to feel healthy, I don’t want to feel some need for wine at the end of the day or vaping etc. I want to be able to just relax and not feel guilty. I want to feel good about my physical state. 

I feel like my choices are either wasting away in bed or detiorating myself with bad things. I just wish I could wake up at a normal time, do my job, go to the gym, make dinner, see a friend or my boyfriend or whatever occasionally, and go to sleep. But that feels so impossible.

I am a grade 10 student currently in my last semester, and okay naman ung aking school life— maganda grades ko, exempted ko sa half of my subjects for exam; I'm in 3 friendgroups and we're all really nice and fun. I have a good relationship with my parents despite the troubles we went through, and they have started to become people I can talk to openly and trust with my health without worrying ""I'm being too dramatic."" Overall maganda naman buhay ko... except for one thing.

Myself.

Sinubukan ko na lahat para lang baguhin ang sarili ko. Wala parin. I feel very numb all the time to the point na ung reaction ko tungkol sa something is talagang based on pure logic lang. ""Ano kaya gagawin ko sa ganitong sitwasyon?"" ""Ano mas magandang emotion/option dito?"" and among many other stuff. Sure, I cherish my friends, my family, and everyone else I know and am close to— pero I don't mind losing them if it ever came to it. I hate it talaga. I hate that I can't recognize emotions and feel the same way other people do— I can't grieve and know what it is like to lose someone beloved, because hindi ko talaga naramdam na mahal ko ang isang tao.

I mostly find peace in solitude too. I enjoy my alone time but I also don't mind being around people, pero pag hindi ako rinereplyan o hindi pinapansin? sobrang bad mood ko to the point wala na akong kinakausap sa mga kaibigan ko. Tapos pag ganyan? biglang may mga pings na ako, nagyayaya magkaraoke, gumala, group study, etc etc. Mas lalo na bbad mood ako. Ewan ko kung bakit ako ganito. Pag wala akong nareceive na compliment at least twice a day, I feel useless and whatnot.

I've tried so hard to improve myself. I tried journaling, painting how I ""felt,"" and doing small stuff to improve myself like self assessment— pero wala parin?? Mas lumala lang talaga ung state ko. Atm, I'm writing this with no sleep starting yesterday as well. No cup of coffee drank.

I want to FEEL how other people feel— not just probabilitate scenarios based on logic and factors that God knows where I got them from. I want to feel emotions, gusto ko maranasan na ang puso ko ang nasusundan, at hindi utak kong parang robot. I want to be vulnerable and open to somebody without pushing them away. I want to feel human, and not whatever this is.

Advice and other stuff welcomed, thank you for reading haha.😭 Pasensya na din kung medyo magulo ang rant ko since I'm not exactly good with describing how I feel talaga.",1,1767690324.0,RantAndVentPH,0,1.0,False

Personally, I’ve found sounds like rain, distant thunder, ocean waves, flowing rivers, forest ambience, or night sounds to be the most calming. On some nights, softer background environments like a campfire, leaves rustling, a passing train, or even a quiet coffee shop also help my mind settle.



Because I’m pretty sensitive to audio, I also avoid sounds with sharp spikes or irregular high frequencies — things like poorly looped tracks tend to wake me up instead of helping.

1q5dhza,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q5dhza/the_three_year_note/,The three year note,"Something in my apartment is always wrong.
Not broken. Not missing. Just… different.

It started with a photograph in the hallway.
A framed picture of my parents at the beach was reversed. Not flipped upside down—just mirrored, like someone had turned it to face the wall and then changed their mind. I assumed I’d done it half-asleep. I turned it back and forgot.

The next morning, my bookshelf had been rearranged.
Cookbooks between novels. A dictionary spine-in, like it was embarrassed.

The coffee was wrong too. Same mug. Same brand. But it tasted like someone describing coffee from memory rather than actually drinking it.

By the end of the week, I started keeping notes:
Monday: Bathroom mirror smudged higher than I can reach
Tuesday: Bedroom lamp moved closer to the bed
Wednesday: Left shoe by the door; Right shoe in the bedroom

It didn’t feel like a break-in. It felt like edits. Helpful ones. The lamp made reading easier. The shoes were exactly where I’d stepped out of them.

I felt managed. Cared for.

I set up a camera in the living room. Eight hours of footage showed nothing but stillness. The apartment stayed exactly as I’d left it.

Until morning.

I woke up to a note on the kitchen bench, written in my handwriting:
“You don’t like the blue mug. Use the white one.”

I laughed. Nervous, real laughter. It sounded better than screaming. I threw the note away.

The next morning it was back, folded more neatly.

After that, the edits became personal. A jacket I hadn’t worn in years hung by the door. My alarm went off five minutes early—just enough time to catch the bus I usually miss. A book sat open on my desk, bookmarked at the chapter where I’d given up years ago.

One night, I stayed awake. Sat on the couch until dawn. Lights on. Heart steady. Waiting.

Nothing happened.

At sunrise, I went into the bathroom and froze.
The mirror was spotless. No smudges. No fingerprints. Taped to the corner was a yellowed note. My handwriting again.

Dated three years ago:
“You always forget this part.”

The realization drained the room of heat.

The apartment wasn’t changing. It was the only thing staying the same.

The edits weren’t new. They were permanent fixtures of a life I’d spent years building. The “wrong” coffee was how I actually liked it. The lamp hadn’t been moved it had been placed. Carefully. Intentionally.

I wasn’t being haunted by a stranger.
I was being curated by a version of myself I could no longer remember.

I wasn’t waking up to a changed room. I was waking up to a changed mind.

Every night, I reset.
The apartment remembered.

Before bed, I wrote one final note:
“If you’re reading this, don’t panic. It’s always been like this.”

I woke up calm.
The note was gone.

1q5d3wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q5d3wf/parking_tips_for_new_jersey_symphony_orchestra_w/,parking tips for new jersey symphony orchestra w/ randall goosby at richardson auditorium (princeton 01/09),"  
  
hey concertgoers, figured i'd share some parking tips for the nj symphony orchestra show this friday, 01/09, at richardson auditorium, because parking in princeton on a friday night is honestly a total mess. that downtown area gets super busy, and you don't want to miss the beginning trying to circle for a spot.  
  
the pro-move, if you can snag it, is to check out prked first. it's an app where people rent out their driveways or private garage spots, and sometimes you can find a spot right next to alexander hall or on a quiet side street way closer than the main garages. it's typically way cheaper too, and you skip the traffic lines getting into the big parking structures.  
  
if prked is a bust, you have two main options, and one is free:  
  
\*\*the free princeton university lots (best value)\*\*  
since the concert is on a friday after 4 pm, you can park for free in most numbered, non-restricted university lots, no permit required. this is your best option if you're willing to walk 5-10 minutes. i'd aim for:  
\* \*\*lots 10 and 13:\*\* these are off williams street, and lot 10 is right behind 185 nassau street. they are free for visitors after 4 pm on weekdays.  
\* \*\*theater drive garage and prospect ave garage:\*\* these are other university options that are open and free after 4 pm.  
\* \*\*stadium drive garage:\*\* this is the biggest lot, a little further away, but it's available and free after 4 pm without the daily permit.  
  
\*\*the downtown municipal garages (closest but paid)\*\*  
if you want to be right in the middle of it, use one of the three downtown garages, which are a 5-10 minute walk to richardson auditorium. these are:  
\* \*\*chambers street garage\*\* (aka palmer square garage).  
\* \*\*hulfish street garage\*\* (aka kinney garage).  
\* \*\*spring street municipal garage\*\*.  
pro tip: the chambers and hulfish street garages offer a discounted rate of a $5.00 max payment if you enter after 4 pm and exit by 2 am \*and\* get a validation sticker from any palmer square merchant. grab a coffee or a quick bite downtown before the show and save some money.  
  
\*\*street parking / warnings\*\*  
honestly, avoid street parking unless you get there super early. meters are strictly enforced, and the time limit is usually one hour, which is nowhere near enough for a full concert. payment is required at meters in the central business district until 9 pm on a friday night. the show starts at 7:30 pm, so you’d still be paying and racing against the meter limit for the first hour and a half of the performance. there are a few 10- or 12-hour meters around, but they are hard to find. also, the intersection near nassau street and washington road can be a headache because they sometimes use a ""pedestrian scramble"" light pattern, which stops all traffic so people can cross diagonally, and that can really back things up.  
  
plan to get there at least 45 minutes early to secure a free university spot or get into a municipal garage before the pre-show rush. also, for those with accessible needs, a limited number of first-come, first-served spots are available on the north side of alexander hall, and you can only drop off guests if you have a disability placard displayed.  
  
hope this helps and enjoy randall goosby!",1,1767688050.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

It started with a photograph in the hallway. A framed picture of my parents at the beach was reversed. Not flipped upside down just mirrored, like someone had turned it to face the wall and then changed their mind. I assumed I’d done it half-asleep. I turned it back and forgot about it.

The next morning, my bookshelf had been rearranged. Not dramatically. Cookbooks between novels. A dictionary placed spine-in, like it was embarrassed.

The coffee was wrong too. Same mug. Same brand. But it tasted like a copy of a memory of coffee rather than the real thing.

By the end of the week, I started keeping notes.
Monday: Bathroom mirror smudged higher than I can reach.
Tuesday: Bedroom lamp moved closer to the bed.
Wednesday: Left shoe by the door. Right shoe in the bedroom.

It didn’t feel like a break-in. It felt like edits.
Helpful ones. The lamp made reading easier. The shoes were exactly where I’d stepped out of them.

I felt managed.
Cared for.

I set up a camera in the living room. Eight hours of footage showed nothing but stillness. The apartment stayed exactly as I’d left it.

Until morning.

I woke up to a note on the kitchen bench, written in my handwriting.

You don’t like the blue mug. Use the white one.

I laughed. Nervous laughter, but real. It sounded better than screaming. I threw the note away.

The next morning it was back, folded more neatly.

After that, the edits became personal. A jacket I hadn’t worn in years was hanging by the door. My alarm went off five minutes early—just enough time to catch the bus I usually miss. A book sat open on my desk, bookmarked at the chapter where I’d given up years ago.

One night, I stayed awake. I sat on the couch until dawn, lights on, heart steady, waiting.

Nothing happened.

At sunrise, I went into the bathroom and froze.

The mirror was spotless. No smudges. No fingerprints. Taped to the corner was a yellowed note, the paper brittle at the edges. My handwriting again.

They also don’t show up on the international Timemore website so they might be a China exclusive at this point. The material is not paper but some kind of cloth. It feels very smooth to the touch.

I just tried making some coffee with them. Here are some interesting things I noticed:
- quite fast drawdown. I don’t have so much comparison but I can say that they are significantly faster than the cafec dark roast
 (I was using the dark roast filters for light roast coffee)
- I got a very cloudy cup. According to the Chinese Timemore website it lets a lot of the oils in the coffee beans through. And it does indeed lead to a quite full bodied cup. 
- one concern I’m having is the bio degradability. I don’t know the exact material so I don’t want to risk throwing them on the compost as I would do for paper filters. For now I will just treat them as residual waste.

Age: 22


Sex: F


Height/Weight: 5’8” and ~130-135 pounds (or ~60kg) 


Medical conditions: POTS, GERD (seeing genetics for an unrelated issue)


Drinking/smoking/drugs: none


Caffeine: not on a regular basis - I have a cup of coffee once in a blue moon 


Sleep: good and consistent, usually 8-9 hours of sleep per night 


Deficiencies: none that I know of (no iron, magnesium, B12, etc.) and I get labs pretty regularly to check my levels due to having POTS 


For about a year now, I’ve had eye twitching almost every day. It’s usually my eyelids, but sometimes it feels like the area just under my eyes too. It’s not painful, just annoying, and I honestly hadn’t thought much of it tbh. 


Today I had an appointment with a geneticist for something completely unrelated, and she did a full physical and neuro style exam. When she did the eye exam (the small light and following it in all directions), she spent quite a long time watching my eyes. She also had me smile really big and noticed that my eyelids and the area below my eyes were twitching during that as well.


Because of that, she’s referring me to an ophthalmologist, and said it should be a quick referral (this week). That part is what’s making me anxious I think. 


My questions:


What could cause persistent daily eye/facial twitching like this?


Does this sound more like something benign or something that warrants concern?


Is an urgent ophthalmology referral typically precautionary in cases like this?


I know no one can diagnose me online; I’m just trying to understand what kinds of things doctors usually consider so I can calm my nerves a bit while I wait. Thanks so much.",1,1767687566.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Why I’m building a [wearable health device](https://sychedelic.com/blogs/the-future-of-wearable-tech-from-fitness-tracking-to-brain-boosting/) company that treats the brain, not just the body.

In a world obsessed with tracking steps and calories, we’ve ignored the most critical organ in the empire: The Human Brain.

As a founder and a mom, I’ve seen the ""forbidden"" truth your mental performance isn't about how much coffee you drink; it’s about how well you manage your cognition. We’ve been taught to survive the ""crap"" life throws at us, but we’ve never had the tools to actually understand your brain in real-time.

**Until now.**

We are building the future of health devices. We aren’t just another tracker; we are a HealthTech revolution focused on neuromodulation and brain health tracking.

**The Sychedelic Mission:**

\- Decoding the Human Brain: We’re moving past guesswork. Our tech is about decoding the human brain to help you understand your stress levels before they lead to a burnout.

\-Beyond Survival: Most wearables tell you that you’re tired. We use neuromodulation to help you shift your state, optimizing cognitive health in just 20 minutes.

\- The Longevity Play: This isn't just about winning the afternoon; it’s about long-term brain health. We are prioritizing longevity so your brain stays as sharp as your ambition.

The future of health devices belongs to those who prioritize cognitive health as much as physical fitness. Whether you're navigating a boardroom or a 3 AM ""poonami,"" you deserve a device that helps you [\#GetSyched](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/getsyched/).
