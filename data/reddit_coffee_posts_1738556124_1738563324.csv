(3 walks a day/10 min training and play sessions scattered throughout the day/mental enrichment games, toys, and chews‚Ä¶)
He has been in training to become my service dog so I take him out with me during the week to stores, coffee shops, and other places to people watch. This routine has worked really well but recently we moved to a house to rent. We wanted more space for him so we now have our own yard and he gets his own room. 
Since moving‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm realizing his crate time is going to increase significantly. He was at most being crated for 4 hours a day outside of night time ‚Ä¶but now we‚Äôre going to be pushing 6 hours because of commute times. 
Not crating him isn‚Äôt an option yet. He gets destructive when left unattended and especially with the new house he wants to explore everywhere. 
I intend to keep his routine as close to normal as possible. I‚Äôm worried 6 hrs is pushing it way too much and what that could do to him. :(

1igik6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1igik6m/not_sure_if_i_should_feel_proud_or_foolish/,Not sure if I should feel proud or foolish,"So tonight I had a very nice dinner with my mom at a modern Italian restaurant. We treated ourselves to dessert to-go and I went for one of my favorites: Tiramisu. Even since I began taking sobriety seriously, I still am able to enjoy certain foods cooked or made with alcohol, like some wine sauces for example, and tiramisu has always been a favorite of mine. But this one.. in the first bite the taste of alcohol was overwhelming, so much that I could smell the liquor as I exhaled through my nose. I really wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just me or not, so I asked my stepdad to try a bite ‚Äî he only tastes the coffee flavor, which he doesn‚Äôt care much for. My mom isn‚Äôt a fan of tiramisu and had no interest in verifying my suspicions. However, I took a second bite and suspicions are confirmed: it‚Äôs definitely coffee liquor, likely Kahlua or Tia Maria, although it could‚Äôve been Marsala wine if they went the authentic route. I set the rest aside as I hate throwing out decent food, went for a cigarette, and even though I‚Äôm proud for stopping myself I can‚Äôt help but wonder if I asked for this sort of thing and that I should be more mindful about my choices with alcohol infused food. Exploring food and trying new cuisine is something very important to me, so I still want to enjoy culinary experiences outside of consuming alcohol directly. I‚Äôve already comfortably removed trying regional wines and liquors like limoncello when it comes to that, my sobriety is important enough to me so I‚Äôm happy to do so. But this is the first time I‚Äôve felt challenged when it came to food and how certain dishes are executed. 

I suppose I‚Äôm writing this to share my experience tonight and see what you all think.

You can feel the pieces come together

The second their eyes meet yours

Soul recognizing soul

Old friends from lives lived long before

There you are, I missed you

You feel like home

You feel like waking up in a tent on a summer morning

Coffee over a fire and birds singing over the lake

You feel like warmth from the sun

The old  wood stove heating my cheeks 

The heavy blankets when consumed in peaceful sleep 

There you are, I missed you

Your pieces knit together with mine so easily, as if they had never been separated to begin with

There you are, I missed you‚ù§Ô∏è

I wrote that for you so many years ago. It‚Äôs not perfect, I am very out of practice, but I read it often since we rediscovered it not that long ago. 

I love you and I miss you so much. I wish I had dealt with my own traumas sooner so I didn‚Äôt project so much of it on to you. I hope our separation helps us heal our own individual demons so we can come back to each other, because god do I want to love on you properly this time. 

You hid so much of the weight you felt on your shoulders love. You did such a good job of providing and working that you genuinely made it look easy. I have always admired you and appreciated you so much for that, but I regret so much now that I dropped the ball on showing you that appreciation..  I stopped didn‚Äôt I? I stopped showing you how much I loved you when dad died and your grandpa passed. We had a new baby and two toddlers. A mortgage, a dog. I fell apart when dad died and I couldn‚Äôt get out of my own way. I didn‚Äôt hold space for you and your own experiences. I needed help and I was too broken to even know where to get it. I made you feel taken for granted. I am so sorry. 

I hid things from you too. The severity of my trauma, the unending pressure and anxiety I constantly felt to be perfect in an attempt to be good enough for you. I thought overworking myself by constantly overdoing it was the price I paid to get to have such a wonderful person in my life. That hurting myself meant I had finally earned the love I never received before you.  That‚Äôs not healthy at all and that had to have been so much to deal with on your part.

I put you on a pedestal that stripped you of your humanity and didn‚Äôt allow you the grace you deserved to make mistakes, while I preached about communicating and being vulnerable with each other. I was so obsessed with working on myself to be better than my parents and ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for you that I completely missed the point and I didn‚Äôt pay attention to what you actually needed. To what actually made you feel loved and cherished. I let it eat me alive and I became bitter and resentful when you didn‚Äôt live up to an impossible standard. I took it as a personal attack, a sign that everything we built was too good to be true. That the illusion was finally dropping and I was going to be abandoned and proven worthless, unlovable, yet again. 

None of that should have been placed on your shoulders though. An impossible weight for anyone, and while you tried to get me help I tried to get it from you. I‚Äôm so sorry. 

I‚Äôve taken so much time to heal myself and grow, and I wish I had been more open with you about what that was like. I wish I‚Äôd let you in. I wish I hadn‚Äôt let bitterness set in a cause you so much hurt. I‚Äôve been so scared to be vulnerable with you since we separated. I‚Äôve grown and changed a lot, and you have been so supportive. I have done counseling, but I took you seriously and I started trauma therapy too. 

I miss you so much my heart hurts in my chest. I am so proud of you for going to school. I am so proud of you for taking big steps in counselling and battling your addictions. I am really proud of you for setting boundaries with me and being honest with your feelings despite how scary that had to be. 

I want to reach out to every five damn minutes but I am not doing that because I respect where you are at and I don‚Äôt want to send us backwards in our healing journeys right now. You are always on my mind though. There is not one day that has gone by since the day I met you that you haven‚Äôt been on my mind, despite my struggles to show that. 

I miss counting your freckles in your sleep.

I miss how green your eyes are when you first wake up, and the way you get goose pimples when I run my hands up and down your back.

I miss the feeling of your arms wrapped around me in our sleep and the scent of you lingering on my body long after you‚Äôve left for work. 

I miss our morning kiss.

I miss your big smile and the way you would hold my hands and dance side to side with me. 

I miss your hugs. God I miss your hugs. 

I miss how you lisp a teeny bit when you‚Äôre really sleepy.

I miss waking up in the morning with you and making pancakes and coffee all by ourselves.

I miss couch cuddles and movie nights.

I miss making your lunches and sneaking love notes into them as often as I could find pen and paper. 

I miss kissing you deeply and passionately and showing you exactly how intensely I feel for you. 

I miss doing life with you. I miss getting to show you love. I hope that when this is done we can have a really open and honest conversation and start dating again. Because if we ever get a chance to love each other again I want to do it right this time. 

Please be safe, make sure you‚Äôre eating enough and know I will never stop loving you. No matter what happens. I just want to see you happy. 

I love you always,

**How can I make sure I‚Äôm a great date tomorrow?**

&#x200B;

Hi all, I‚Äôm a single dad in my mid 30s, and after my marriage ended last year I‚Äôm dipping my toe back into dating (via ‚Äòthe apps‚Äô)‚Ä¶ with a coffee shop date tomorrow!

I‚Äôm normally very chatty, ask lots of questions, and over the last 5 years I‚Äôve become much more confident and extroverted‚Ä¶

But I‚Äôm suddenly so nervous! The lady is really interesting and funny and beautiful, she‚Äôs mid 30s single parent too so similar situations. But really worried my mind will go blank, or I‚Äôll ask too many questions like an interview, or my ex will walk in or something!

Any tips / advice? Any suggested topics to chat about? Have I made a mistake by doing a coffee date and not an activity? Agghhh!

**UPDATE:**

Thanks all! It went great. At the end she asked about a second date, which I just booked! We chatted about a fun idea for a third too. I loved listening to her talk. She seems genuine and sharp and kind, and she‚Äôs bloody gorgeous and well out of my league! She‚Äôs a rocket!

*just go there and be yourself A lot of people seem to forget that if you want a good relationship, they need to be compatible with you (and vice versa), and the only way to do that effectively is to be yourself. If you meet someone who is compatible with you when you are being yourself, you will hit it off fine.*

Hey folks! So a week or so ago I posted  and had a lot of great / lovely / funny / weird responses from you all.

Just wanted to give an update‚Ä¶.

So date 1 went reaaaally well. üôÉ I was predictably nervous as shit and sort of in awe of her in person, so I definitely didn‚Äôt take in everything she said‚Ä¶ it was a bit like trying to hear someone while also staring into the evening sun and while white noise blared really loud in your ears‚Ä¶ you know? Lovely‚Ä¶ but hard to take stuff in! But it was a very cute coffee date and I managed to remain coherent enough to decide date 2!

We planned date 2 (dinner and wine üòä)‚Ä¶ but then before that booking came around we snuck in a walk the day before, so date 3 came before date 2 üòÑ, real cute stuff.

Dinner and wine was amazing‚Ä¶ stayed til the restaurant closed, then chatted and such all night. Just got home. She‚Äôs a bit of a delight. Super lush. What a time to be alive. ü´†

Just wanted to share that wholesomeness with you this morning Reddit. I‚Äôll probably leave it there unless anything significant happens in the future!

Have just the most incredible Sunday internet friends!

1igierm,https://www.reddit.com/r/babyshower/comments/1igierm/how_to_organise_a_special_baby_shower_when/,How to organise a special Baby Shower when family‚Äôs expectations clash?,"Ok, so one of my best friends has recently announced her pregnancy (after 4 years of trying), so naturally me and one of her other close friends are super excited at the news and are already geared up starting to think of ideas for the baby shower.¬†

But it‚Äôs not even a week later and we‚Äôre already hitting hurdles.¬†

When the parents-to-be told us about the pregnancy, the mum-to-be suggested we team up with her sister and SIL to organise the shower - both my friend and I won‚Äôt be able to offer our homes as the venue for the shower (my place is too small, and my friend lives too far out of town), so the hope was that since both the sister and SIL have houses, they would offer one of their places as the venue.¬†She tried to set the expectation that since both the sister and SIL have kids (my friend and I don't), they may have less time to plan the shower than we would). Totally fair.

Mum to be also mentioned late May would be a suitable time for the shower (which makes sense, since that would be in the third Trimester, but is also at the end of Autumn and just before it gets super cold in the southern hemisphere (5-16\*C)).¬†

A little about the mum-to-be (this is all relevant, I promise): To set the scene on what kind of standard of shower we should be aiming for, one of the first things to ask is ‚Äòhow does the mum-to-be throw a party?‚Äô We‚Äôre looking at someone who cooks from scratch, she and her hubby love hosting dinner parties and other parties/gatherings, and will make an extensive spread of high-tea goodies for parties she throws - often having to spend a day or 2 beforehand making all the magic happen in the kitchen. She‚Äôs the kind of woman who will sit with friends and do a basic movie night with a charcuterie board and wine, and throws dinner parties with the good china and silverware (yes, real silverware). Acts of service and personal time are two of her love languages.

So - the next day comes after the big news and my friend and I were super excited - the creative juices started flowing and almost immediately we started brainstorming ideas for the theme, colour scheme and menus etc. I created a Pinterest board so we could start collaborating ideas (with the intent to share this with the sister and SIL). After about 24 hours of ideas percolating, we created a chat for the sister and SIL to join in the organising as we wanted to make sure everyone had the opportunity to put their ideas forward, and we assumed they had already started thinking about it like we had.¬†

Our initial chat comment, which made some initial suggestions (but essentially opened up the dialogue for discussion).

In our message we‚Äôd mentioned the theme idea my friend had come up with, as well as a potential colour scheme idea, and made the suggestion that an Airbnb might be a good option for us as that would take the pressure off anyone having to host at home‚Äîespecially with families and work schedules‚Äîand would save them from having to deal with cleanup afterward, so everyone could just relax and enjoy the day‚Äô.¬†

\[Having not been to either of their houses, we weren‚Äôt sure whether their homes were big enough venues for the likely number of guests \~15\]

We also asked them what their thoughts were and what ideas they had so far.

After a day, we heard from the SIL - her initial (and only reply thus far) was to first question how big we were planning to go with her shower and to point out that baby showers are typically a couple of hours on a weekend.

She wasn‚Äôt sure about the Airbnb approach, since that would involve spending more money than she'd like, and pointed out that a memorable shower was still achievable without spending big. Since the shower would fall in the winter, the main thing should be that the venue needs to be warm, but she thought we‚Äôd be able to have ""a lovely time anywhere"".¬†

Note: She didn't offer her home as the venue, so we interpreted this to kind of mean ‚Äòanywhere but my place‚Äô.¬†

SIL also stated she was happy for everyone to have creative licence to do what we feel the mum-to-be would love and to let her know if we need any ‚Äòjobs‚Äô sorted.¬†

Given the SIL has 2 small kids, it‚Äôs absolutely fair that she may not have the time to help with organising, and may not feel comfortable being the venue provider, however this then meant that a lot was potentially riding on the sister to come through with the venue (since there aren‚Äôt any other ‚Äòfree‚Äô venue options).¬†

So my friend and I hung back and waited for the sister to 1) read the chat, and 2) respond to the chat.¬†

4 days after the chat was started, she reads the message and responds, reiterating that baby showers are only a couple of hours, and suggested that it be held at the mum-to-be‚Äôs house.¬†

She offered food suggestions  and shared a couple of her experiences at past showers she‚Äôs attended (three where we were in the back space of a cafe/restaurant private function space with a coffee tab, and another where they had 80+ people and hired a hall, etc.)

While she did included a lot of helpful suggestions on game ideas, food (typical platter food/nibbles), her next suggestion was to hold the shower in June (winter, when temps are around 3-13\*C) and followed up by saying she thinks it‚Äôs too early to do be planning anything yet (saying ""we certainly don't need 5 months to plan a shower"").

She was happy with the idea of having a theme and colour scheme and thought a balloon backdrop/arch would be cute to have photos in front of and suggested we put it on hold for now and start planning in April (3 months before her suggested start) and give ourselves a few weeks after sending the invites out to source/make/buy the decorations, games and cake we pick in line with the theme we choose.¬†

Note: She also didn't offer her home as a venue, so we don‚Äôt really have any free venue options left.¬†

While I do appreciate that working and having kids makes it harder to offer your home as a venue for things like parties or showers, not having either of them offer (especially when they say it‚Äôs only a couple of hours on the weekend) makes the logistics of this harder. If I didn‚Äôt live in a tiny flat that can barely fit 5 people, I‚Äôd offer my place in a heartbeat, as would my friend if she didn‚Äôt live hours away, so we're a little disappointed.

I also understand the point about it being early to plan - it is about 6 months out at the moment, but considering the coordination required, work, travel and family commitments amongst all of us between now and then, and making sure guests have sufficient time to rsvp/book flights/hotels (we have interstate guests), it‚Äôs important we start sooner rather than later to avoid a last-minute scramble or people being unable to come because they didn‚Äôt have enough advanced notice. She‚Äôs right - it certainly doesn‚Äôt take 5 months to plan a shower, the actual time to plan is the same regardless of when you start 6 months before or 2 months before, but the sooner you start planning the less problems you‚Äôre likely to run into.¬†

My friend and I agreed that 2-3 weeks of prep time is not enough considering we work full-time and have to travel often for work, so she has since commented to say that \[sending invitations\] 2 months would be more appropriate to allow for online orders/making decorations/putting things together etc.

In terms of venue, we can‚Äôt ask the parents-to-be to provide the venue because:

* Mum-to be is always hosting parties - so having the shower at her home (even if other people are organising) isn‚Äôt really special or unique¬†
* The pregnancy is a big deal for them (4 years in the making), so the shower should be treated like a special event¬†
* We‚Äôd have to kick them out of their own house so we can set up and decorate - when she‚Äôs in her 3rd trimester (in late Autumn). Building a balloon etc. arch takes time, so that‚Äôs hours of inconvenience for them.¬†
* Being the kind of entertainer that she is, it‚Äôs going to be hard for her to sit back and have someone else run things when she‚Äôs so used to being the host in her home - this might make her fill ill-at-ease and enjoy the shower less.
* She deserves to have a shower that‚Äôs a really nice surprise with effort put into it, and it‚Äôs not going to be a surprise if it‚Äôs in her living room
* Having them host the venue (even if they‚Äôre not running the actual shower) puts onus on them to prepare their house for guests - at that stage of the pregnancy, the last thing we want to do is stress them out forcing them to have their house visitor ready
* Then, at the end of the shower, we have to unpack it all, and that can be an imposition to them as they might just want to chill out and relax
* Bonus point: if mum-to-be was organising a baby shower for someone else, there's no way she'd make them do it at their home (unless they expressly asked for it)

We‚Äôve looked at a few paid venue options, but:

* The first option (as it's the favourite restaurant for mum and dad to-be) is just under 2k.
* The second option barely holds 10, let alone 15-20 and would be awkward for games.
* The third option would cost around $1k just for tables at restaurant (not a private space)
* The fourth is a function room, but that‚Äôs at least $1000 and doesn‚Äôt allow external catering, BYO, or provide enough time to set up.
* Other unpaid options, like cafes/restaurants, don‚Äôt have private spaces, so the games/present openings would be awkward, and they might not cater for all our dietaries on the day.¬†

I‚Äôm still committed to the airbnb idea since it will:

* give us time to set up the balloon arch and games
* we can make the food (to mum-to-be‚Äôs standard) that meets all the dietaries (for half the price of catered food)
* we can have some champagne/drinks for those who want it
* we have time to clean up without imposing on anyone (or being charged late fees)
* we can make sure we have enough space/seating to fit all the guests¬†
* Guaranteed heating, that can be preheated beforehand to make the house comfortable
* If mum-to-be needs something cooked or heated up, we‚Äôll have a kitchen there
* we‚Äôre guaranteed a private space so there‚Äôs no awkwardness with games/opening presents
* there will be separate bedrooms if mum-to-be wants to lay down
* makes the event more special for them because it‚Äôs not just a regular restaurant or their own house
* nobody is forced to clean up (except myself and my friend (if she chooses)), so people can leave the shower and just go back to their normal lives
* If the core group of friends want to kick on after people start leaving the shower, they can
* When the parents-to-be are ready to leave, they can at any time, knowing there‚Äôs no clean up or people in their house to shoo
* Even with the expense of the Airbnb and catering, it‚Äôs still cheaper than most of the other paid venue options - the airbnb + catering + decorations is probably closer to 600-800 all up.

My friend and I aren‚Äôt trying to do anything lavish and over the top, but we do want to make sure that our friend gets a baby shower that‚Äôs at least up to her standard and not left to the last minute (and therefore disorganised and stressful). I‚Äôm worried that the sister/SILs drive to keep the costs low and the effort to a minimum will result in ‚Äúcreative differences‚Äù and a political mess. The mum-to-be wants them both to be involved, as do we, and I‚Äôd like to think they both WANT to be involved, but I suspect if my friend and I weren‚Äôt here, they might be looking at something no-frills and impersonal like telling everyone to meet at a cafe, and¬†potentially alienating the other patrons with baby shower games, which would make mum-to-be feel like she isn‚Äôt special enough to plan a proper (private) shower for.¬†My friend and I really don't want that.

Obviously the parents-to-be don‚Äôt know anything about this, nor do we want them to as we don‚Äôt want to create family drama or upset the mum-to-be.

Has anyone navigated a tricky family dynamic when planning a baby shower? Any advice on how to keep the sister and SIL happy and involved when we clearly have different ideas on how this baby shower should go?",1,1738562260.0,babyshower,0,1.0,False
1igiefl,https://brewlog.coffee/,Digital Coffee Journal,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been working on a project called BrewLog‚Äîa simple, digital coffee journal designed to help coffee enthusiasts track their tastings, take notes, and log brewing methods.

As a coffee nerd myself, I‚Äôve always found it tricky to keep consistent notes on what worked (and what didn‚Äôt) with different beans, grind sizes, and brew methods. I‚Äôve been using a physical coffee journal (just a regular notebook), but it quickly got messy and hard to organize. So, I started looking around for a digital coffee journal that could solve this problem. To my surprise, I could only find one or two options‚Äîand they were really outdated, lacking the features I wanted.

That‚Äôs when I decided to build BrewLog.

What BrewLog Does:
	‚Ä¢	Track your brews: Log details like origin, roast, grind size, brew time, and tasting notes.
	‚Ä¢	Discover patterns: See what techniques lead to your favorite cups.
	‚Ä¢	Perfect your process: Learn from your own data to improve over time.
	‚Ä¢	Coffee Map: Visualize where you‚Äôve had coffee from around the world.
	‚Ä¢	Community Recommendations: See other users‚Äô tasting notes to discover new coffees to try.

I‚Äôm currently preparing for launch, and I‚Äôll be sending out emails soon to invite a small group of people for early access. If you‚Äôre interested in testing it out and giving me feedback, sign up here:
üëâ https://brewlog.coffee/

I‚Äôd love your input:
	‚Ä¢	Would you find this useful?
	‚Ä¢	What features would you like to 
see? 
	‚Ä¢	Any design ideas you would like?

I‚Äôm genuinely looking to make this a good tool that people can use whenever they do tastings. Or to know whether this is just a bad idea. So any input (or brutal honesty) is appreciated. Thanks for reading",1,1738562222.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

# Savings & Investments

Always followed a **Save First, Spend Later** approach‚Äî**saved at least 40%** of my income at every stage.

**Expense allocation philosophy**:

* **40% savings & investments**
* **20% rent**
* **40% expenses**

First **2 years**: Only saved via **Recurring Deposits (RDs)**, which later became my **emergency fund**.

**2016**: Opened my **first Demat account**, started **‚Çπ25K/month SIPs in mutual funds**, and occasionally bought stocks.

Most of my stock picks were **coffee can stocks**‚Äîlow-risk, long-term investments.

# Avoiding Debt

* **Didn‚Äôt chase high returns** with mid/small-cap-heavy investments.
* **XIRR unknown**, but disciplined monthly investing was key.
* **Discipline > Luck > Talent**‚Äîapplies to finance and life in general.

# Key Learnings & Mindset

* **Money is meant to be used wisely**‚ÄîI don‚Äôt believe in hoarding wealth without enjoying or sharing it.
* My **mother & spouse have been my biggest support systems**, and I make sure to show gratitude‚Äîwhether through occasional gifts or treating them from my bonuses.
* **Frugality is a superpower**‚ÄîMy mother ran the household & my education single-handedly when my father lost his job, and I never felt deprived. That early experience taught me how to **balance saving and spending**.

# Final Thoughts

I know many of us come from **non-elite colleges, no FAANG jobs, no startup equity, and no international earnings**. But **consistent investing, conscious spending, and smart career moves** can still get us to financial milestones.

I‚Äôm not here to give advice, just sharing what worked for me. Hope this helps someone out there. Would love to hear others‚Äô journeys too!",26,1738562093.0,personalfinanceindia,4,0.96,False

Hi guys!

I‚Äôm really feeling like I‚Äôm stuck here. There seems to be no good path, I have no idea what to do. 
The thing is I‚Äôm a psychologist. Finished my masters in 2021, and have been working as a barista ever since. I really really love working in coffee shops, even with the long and exhausting shifts in the picture. I love everything about hospitality services. For the longest time I‚Äôve had the dream of opening up my small cozy little community oriented Japanese style vibes coffee shop. Don‚Äôt get me wrong here, I have all the plans laid out, I‚Äôve been working on them for years. Everything mapped out and I truly believe that it would work. Everyone I have ever worked with told me that I have a soul for hospitality services and they wonder if I will ever open up my own place. 
Recently tho, I‚Äôve been working part time as a psychologist too, and I hate it. I really don‚Äôt feel good in that role, I feel like an outsider to the field. My soul is in a coffee shop, I know my calling is serving people drinks/cakes/sweets and making them feel comfortable and safe. 

The thing is, working as a psychologist would in some time guarantee more money than a coffee shop. I‚Äôm not even sure if this is true anymore, but my wife and family thinks so. Everyone says I should be in the field of counselling, everyone even my therapist too, just not me. I don‚Äôt want to do it. 

Another thing is I have some money on my hand, which would be more than enough to start up a small coffee shop, but I would need the help of my wife and family, I can‚Äôt do it alone. Wife said the other day that the coffee thingy was my dream, not hers, and she wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable there. Also she would not support me channeling the money mentioned above into the business. I‚Äôm really shot here.

I feel like if I‚Äôd do anything else rather than hospitality services I would sacrifice my true self for money and what not. I would find no joy in work and would have no motivation at all. I also feel that it would absolutley go against our marriage to act on my own and start up business, I really love my wife and would not like to hurt her that way. 

I feel like I‚Äôm standing before a road that leads to two ways: one being a life of regret and resentment, another one meanig the freedom of doing what I really love, my ikigai.

I‚Äôve met a few people on Reddit over the years and still haven‚Äôt gotten robbed, gone missing, and still have both my kidneys so I figured why not try looking for a GF for Valentine's üëâüëà‚Ä¶¬†

**Quick about me:**

I‚Äôm a nerdy guy who‚Äôs a B.A psychology graduate and currently working for experience to apply to a counseling Master‚Äôs program this year or the next. I plan on staying in California for that, L.A or San Jose. Counseling and therapy fields are my calling so to say I love listening to people would be an understatement hence why yappers are my favorite type of people.

  
**So what am I into?**

* Anime/manga - I prefer the depressing ones, the ones that make you question life for an entire month, or the ones that are so funny you start crying from laughter. Konosuba, Bochi the Rock, Stein‚Äôs Gate, and Re-zero just to name a few of my many favorite anime. I also like non-anime ( Arcane is goated) Breaking bad, The Boys, etc. I haven‚Äôt watched/finished many of the popular shows if wanna watch them with me :p
* Gaming - I‚Äôm mainly casual but can be competitive. I prefer co-op, team, and survival crafting games. Monster Hunter, Terraria, and Souls-like games are my favorites. I also play new or popular games as well, league of Legends üíÄ, Marvel Rivals,etc
* Cooking -¬† I steal recipes from restaurants and feel comfortable attempting to cook anything‚Ä¶ aside from baking ‚Ä¶ I .. uhm.. I don‚Äôt wanna talk about that.
* Working out - I kinda like to be active but tbh I‚Äôm still trying to be consistent ( I‚Äôve legit been on and off working out for 3-6 months periods like 3-4 times now haha‚Ä¶)
* Etc/ stuff I‚Äôm into but don‚Äôt do often - Camping, swimming, canoeing, rafting, writing, hiking.
* Stuff I want to get into- Cosplay, going to gaming/anime conventions, learning a new language( Japanese or Spanish), learning how to draw digital art, and getting back into video editing/making.

It‚Äôd be cool if you were into a lot of these but anime and gaming are my main hobbies and I‚Äôd love to share at least ONE¬† of my main hobbies with someone special.

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

Someone single, childless, nerdy into anime and or gaming, preferably a yap-aholic who‚Äôs escaped yap-rehab for the second time this week, and is in the L.A area or San Jose area or at most 1-2 hours driving distance from those areas.¬†

My only REAL physical preference is that you be smaller than me ( -187lbs and -6ft).¬† Mega ultra extra bonus points if you like being carried, lifted, and sitting on people‚Äôs shoulders.

Potential green flag/red flags that I feel like most people would wanna know upfront in no particular order:

* Politically I‚Äôm left-leaning. I can‚Äôt see myself dating a republican/right-leaning person.
* Non-religious and never will be..( unless I‚Äôm gambling/rerolling stats in-game, then I‚Äôm the most religious man you‚Äôll ever meet lol )
* I‚Äôm 50/50 on children and don‚Äôt expect to be ready to have children until I‚Äôm roughly mid-late 30‚Äôs¬†
* I‚Äôm REALLY relationship/sexually inexperienced, not completely inexperienced/clueless but I‚Äôm just barely on the board.¬†
* Heavily prefers cats over dogs but does well with either.
* I don‚Äôt drink or smoke but I am a coffee fiend.¬†

Welp anyway, If I sound like your mans, make my inbox turn orange already :)

**Please include your ASL, a picture or physical description, and a little bit about yourself and what you like about me/what similarities we share.**¬†

More chatting about what we both want, and like and he even suggests we take some trips together as we are both now relatively new to the area. He initiated it, was even looking at booking tickets. He even initiates some more intimacy. And I personally didn‚Äôt want to have sex so soon, I wanted to wait and clearly told him that to which he agreed he wanted to as well. It was all very openly discussed. 

So in my mind, I‚Äôm ready for him to ask me to be his gf, make a commitment. I know we are on the same page about values/morals/religion/finances even/and future plans like family and lifestyle. 

Dec5- texting him
Me: I asked if we are official? (I should have just asked what we are) 
Him: responded he wanted to wait and not rush things, that a couple months of dating would do us no harm. But was ‚Äú100% interested in me and exclusively so, no on hinge, not planning on changing that. A couple months of dating won‚Äôt hurt us if we are in it for the long haul(which I definitely am) ‚Äú
And I guess I was taken aback because he was doing all the boyfriend things and me all the girlfriend things. He was literally planning his work schedule to see what fits mine so we can do trips up through March of this year. But I did reflect, we‚Äôd only really been seeing each other for not even a month, he was probably right. And I said so, that thats a good idea. Then called me, he wanted to have the discussion over a call(which I really did appreciate). And the convo went something like this. 
Him: are you ok do you agree with what I said
Me: yea, I think I just misread some things, but agree with what you said. I think I just need to step back from some of the intimacy stuff (all we‚Äôd done was touchy stuff not actual sex as we both communicated we wanted to wait). 
Him: oh I wasn‚Äôt thinking that, but ok. 
Me: yea its ok. I think we just take a step back and focus on our friendship like you said, and  date for awhile longer. 
Him: *thinks for a bit* I guess I can‚Äôt really think of a reason why we shouldn‚Äôt be together though. 
Me: *half crying because I feel rejected and just wanting to do the right thing*Lets just focus on dating and getting to know each other, as you said and go from there. 
So he says ok, and then asks if I want to come over that night to which I do. 

That night I‚Äôm a little off, which I feel is normal, I just basically threw myself at a guy I had known for a month in person and was told I needed to slow down. But he then asks me if I want to be his gf. And I think I may have totally fuck this up, but also feel like I made the logical right decision. When he asked I told him: you dan‚Äôt really ask me now..I mean..I do..but I don‚Äôt want to make you ask me to be your gf. 
And then he says nothing and the convo just ended. And I‚Äôm fully aware that he could have felt offended by this but i just wanted to do the right thing. I didn‚Äôt want him feeling pressured to commit, since that morning he seemed pretty sure about dating longer before slapping a label on it.  

So the day after he tells me he's sick with a bug vomiting, which proceed to go on Dec 6,7,8. He sounded miserable and I hadn‚Äôt heard from him, though I understand he was sleeping and just resting up. Anyway I offered to bring him soup and did so that Monday Dec 9th. I put so much work into it and dropped it off, and he invited me in, and one thing led to the next and we almost had sex, but I stopped it. And then I left, but there were no bad vibes when I left. 

Throughout that week we just kinda hung out after work, and watched movies. It was still nice and he‚Äôd even drop by after his late night shifts for about 30mins or so before going home. 

Dec 12th I go to my door and he‚Äôs left me flowers. It was very sweet and I called and chatted with him a couple time that week too since we weren‚Äôt seeing each other. We are also texting a couple times a day, very lightly, nothing crazy and not really small talk.  Well then he asks and plans for us to go on an iceskating date Dec 14. I‚Äôm to stay at his place Dec 13th, get coffee with him Dec 14 morning and go ice skating. Mind he is a nurse so he works long hrs. 

Dec13-he cancels me staying over b/c work has been long but suggest stopping by later that night instead. He then doesn‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt here from him. -I‚Äôm no bothered I get that he‚Äôs tired I get it work was long and rough. 

Dec 14. Its 11:00 and still haven‚Äôt heard from him about time and plans for our date, so I text him to see how its going. Don‚Äôt hear back until 2:00pm. Then ask if we are still on for ice skating. Its now 3:00 and no answer. I already had a prior commitment at 6:00 that he knew about that evening so this date was not happening and I hate waiting for the guy who made the plans to let me know what was happening and just told him that I wasn‚Äôt feeling it. He was happy, said I was the best because he didn‚Äôt want to cancel it thinking I‚Äôd be let down. Well I was infact very much let down, he should have just told me when he got up that morning to tell me plans were canceled not waiting until mid afternoon. I played it off and just said its fine, we‚Äôll reschedule

The next 2 days he doesn‚Äôt reach out or text so I message him to check in. He then suggests coming and visiting me Dec 17 

Dec 17-he visits, is exhausted from work and sleep for awhile then starts making out and tries having sex again, to which I told him no. We‚Äôd discussed it. But I did ask-‚ÄúAre we going to have sex?‚Äù. 
Him: We shouldn‚Äôt

And I really wanted to ask if sex was a deal breaker for him. Because despite communicating and agreeing with me about not having sex. He was still initiating it. And I‚Äôm ok with all the external stuff, and touching but he‚Äôd keep going to where I thought we were actually going to do it. 
I‚Äôm also leaving Dec 23rd to go home for the holidays so I ask if I can see him again, he‚Äôs off Dec 11th, but says he can‚Äôt he has a report to write (he had this a week ago and was working on it). 

So later he leaves after just chatting. And then I heard nothing from him the next couple days. I had sent him an instagram reel a few days ago-unopened, same with a snapchat,both of which we were consistently sending, but nothing excessive. Like one or 2 a day. 
Come Friday I ask if he wanted to hang out, but he‚Äôs working everyday that week. 12hr shifts every day so I know he‚Äôs tired. And he makes no effort to see me that I guess thats that. 

I text him I‚Äôm leaving and then ghosted the entire Christmas week. I accept that he‚Äôs lost interest. But he still has my pot I made the soup I made him. That pot is expensive so I just ask if I can get it back. And he drops it off after work. (Dec 30). He takes no move to try to knock on the door and talk to me just walks away. And he knows I‚Äôm home. I watched him walk away and it hurt so much. 

2 weeks later Jan 12. I text him. (Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have but I couldn‚Äôt figure out what happened. 
Me: What happened between up
Him: Idk i think some bad communicating habits on my part. I‚Äôm watching lord of the rings if you want to join. 
Me: hmmmm
Him: that sounds like a loaded ‚Äúhmm‚Äù. Considerate it a belated birthday. (His bday)
Me: No. 

I tried keeping it short and sweet. I feel like all the advise you get here is ‚Äúsilence is the best communication‚Äù and I just couldn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd ghost me after what felt like love bombing, and then when I reached out he asks to hang out, but in a non intentional like ‚Äúi want to see you‚Äù way. And also request it as a bday present. Like wtf. I had also checked his hinge profile and one of his pictures had changed. 


Anyway its been 2 more weeks later and I‚Äôve cried so much. Like I think I actually loved the guy. And it just hurts so much. And its ridiculous. I knew the guy for such a short time. 

I just need to know what you all think. Did I do too much? Maybe I led him on sexually? I just..he seemed too good to have done this without a reason. ",1,1738561348.0,AmITheJerk,0,1.0,False

Ah, sarcasm. That peculiar mix of humor and hostility, wit and wounding, intelligence and irony. It‚Äôs the sharp, unexpected twist in a conversation that can leave one person chuckling and another blinking in confusion‚Äîor worse, stewing in silent offense. But what is sarcasm, really? Is it just a snarky remark meant to entertain or criticize? Or does it carry deeper implications about human communication, relationships, and even the way we process the world?  

Pull up a chair, because we‚Äôre about to unpack the enigmatic nature of sarcasm in all its glory‚Äîand its pitfalls.  

### Sarcasm as a Double-Edged Sword  

Let‚Äôs start with a definition. Sarcasm, in its simplest form, is a form of verbal irony where a person says one thing but means the opposite. Think of it as a linguistic sleight of hand, often accompanied by a certain tone, a smirk, or a raised eyebrow to clue others in. For example, if someone spills coffee on themselves and you quip, ‚ÄúOh, smooth move!‚Äù‚Äîcongratulations, you‚Äôve just wielded the sarcasm sword.  

But here‚Äôs the thing about swords: they cut both ways. Sarcasm can be hilarious and even disarming in the right context, breaking tension and eliciting laughs. Yet, it can also be biting and cruel, leaving the recipient feeling mocked or misunderstood. The very same comment‚Äî‚ÄúSmooth move!‚Äù‚Äîmight be taken as a lighthearted joke among friends or as a stinging criticism in a tense workplace.  

I‚Äôve had my fair share of experiences on both ends. Once, while navigating the chaos of kindergarten teaching (yes, imagine trying to herd cats that can talk back), I joked to a colleague, ‚ÄúWow, this is exactly how I imagined my life turning out!‚Äù She laughed, knowing I was venting about the madness of the moment. But had I said the same thing to someone who didn‚Äôt know me well, it might have come off as ungrateful or bitter. Sarcasm‚Äôs effectiveness often hinges on shared context and mutual understanding‚Äîa fragile balance, to say the least.  

### The Appeal of Sarcasm  

Why do we use sarcasm at all, given its potential for misunderstanding? For starters, it‚Äôs an incredibly efficient way to communicate complex emotions. Sarcasm can pack layers of meaning into just a few words, conveying humor, frustration, and even affection simultaneously. It‚Äôs no wonder that many of us lean on it as a social tool‚Äîit allows us to vent, bond, and entertain all at once.  

Take family dynamics, for instance. In my household, sarcasm was practically a love language. If my brother served up a plate of burnt pancakes, I‚Äôd say something like, ‚ÄúAh, a chef in the making!‚Äù He‚Äôd roll his eyes, but the banter was part of our connection. Sarcasm, in this sense, can be a playful way of showing familiarity and closeness.  

And then there‚Äôs the sheer joy of wordplay. Sarcasm appeals to our intellect‚Äîit‚Äôs a little puzzle, an opportunity to be clever. It‚Äôs no accident that some of the sharpest comedians rely heavily on sarcasm to get their point across. Think of it as a verbal game of dodgeball: you throw a witty jab, and if the other person catches it, you‚Äôve scored a moment of shared amusement.  

### The Dark Side of Sarcasm  

But let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it: sarcasm has its dark side. While it can be funny and clever, it can also be a mask for passive aggression. Instead of addressing issues directly, people often use sarcasm as a way to air grievances without taking full responsibility for their words. ‚ÄúOh, no, don‚Äôt worry about helping me clean up‚Äîyou‚Äôre clearly too busy scrolling Instagram!‚Äù might sound playful, but underneath, it‚Äôs seething with resentment.  

This is where sarcasm can become destructive. When used excessively or inappropriately, it can erode trust and create emotional distance. Research even suggests that sarcastic communication in relationships can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. After all, not everyone is adept at decoding irony, especially when emotions are running high.  

I once had a friend who used sarcasm as her default mode of communication. At first, it was amusing‚Äîher quick wit was unmatched. But over time, it became exhausting. Every conversation felt like a verbal sparring match, and I started to wonder if she ever said what she truly meant. Eventually, our friendship cooled, not because of one big falling out, but because the constant sarcasm created a barrier between us.  

### The Psychology of Sarcasm  

What makes sarcasm so fascinating‚Äîand frustrating‚Äîis how deeply rooted it is in our psychology. Sarcasm requires a certain level of cognitive sophistication to both deliver and understand. You‚Äôre essentially asking someone to hold two opposing ideas in their mind at once: the literal meaning of your words and the intended meaning.  

Children, for example, often struggle to grasp sarcasm until they‚Äôre around 6 or 7 years old, when their brains have developed enough to process complex social cues. Similarly, people with certain neurological conditions, such as autism or brain injuries, may find sarcasm particularly challenging, as it relies heavily on context, tone, and nonverbal signals.  

Interestingly, studies have found that sarcasm can actually enhance creativity. By forcing us to think outside the box and interpret layered meanings, sarcasm stimulates abstract thinking. So the next time someone accuses you of being too sarcastic, you can always claim it‚Äôs for the sake of mental exercise!  

### Striking the Right Balance  

So, where does this leave us? Should we embrace sarcasm or avoid it altogether? Like most things in life, the answer lies in moderation and intention.  

Sarcasm can be a powerful tool for humor, connection, and self-expression, but it‚Äôs important to wield it carefully. Consider your audience: Are they likely to understand and appreciate your tone? Think about your intent: Are you trying to make someone laugh, or are you subtly expressing anger or frustration?  

One of the most valuable lessons I‚Äôve learned as a teacher is the importance of clear, kind communication. While sarcasm might fly in a casual setting, it‚Äôs rarely productive in more serious or sensitive contexts. With my kindergarteners, for example, I‚Äôve learned to ditch sarcasm entirely‚Äîit‚Äôs simply too confusing for their literal minds. Instead, I opt for honesty and encouragement, which fosters trust and understanding.  

### In Conclusion  

Sarcasm is a fascinating and multifaceted aspect of human communication. It can be sharp and clever, a delightful way to engage with others, or a destructive force that alienates and wounds. Whether you see it as an art form or a bad habit likely depends on how it‚Äôs been wielded in your own life.  

The next time you‚Äôre tempted to unleash a sarcastic quip, pause for a moment. Consider the context, the recipient, and the potential impact. Used wisely, sarcasm can add color and complexity to our conversations. But used recklessly, it can leave scars.  

So, is sarcasm a gift or a curse? Maybe, in true sarcastic fashion, the answer is both‚Äîand that‚Äôs what makes it so uniquely human.

**Title: Finding YOUR Best Web Design Company: A Data-Driven Guide (Not Just Hype)**

Hey folks, finding a **good web design company** is tough, right? Maybe 90% of us feel lost. I also felt like this. Many website promises do not match results. So, how to see through all the hype? I think we must look at data and reviews, not just smooth talking. This article will help us all see how to analyze what really matters. We will learn how to find a web design team that suits **our specific needs.** This is not to find one 'best' company. It is to find 'best for you'. We will be checking the details and facts. This is the way to make smart choices.

**Article 2**

r/webdev

**Title: The Challenges of Choosing a Web Design Company**

Why is picking a **web design company** so hard? I believe many things add to this challenge. One problem is 'best' is different for everyone. A big online shop needs different things than a local coffee place. Some companies only know one thing well. They may not fit your business. The internet changes quickly. So, how to check if a company knows the newest things? Most reviews may have a bias. Many show only nice things. They might hide bad things. Many **companies hide their numbers** and successes. This makes choosing tough.

**Article 3**

r/smallbusiness

**Title: Key Evaluation Criteria: Experience and Portfolio**

How do we choose a **web design company**? I think we must study the details. First, we check how long they have been in business. This can tell us about their knowledge. We also look at their **web design portfolio**. This shows us their skill in making different types of sites. It is better to check case studies. These are real examples of their work, with goals and results. Look if they have worked with the clients of a similar size as us. A long time in business does not mean they are the **best for us**.

**Article 4**

r/entrepreneur

**Title: Technical Expertise: The Backbone of Good Web Design**

A good **web design company** needs many technical skills. They must know the main programming languages. Things like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are important. They must also use the right platform, the CMS. The site must look good on any mobile device. We call this mobile responsiveness. Also, the site should load very fast. **Website optimization** can not be forgotten. I believe that the best websites must be easy for anyone to use, including people with disabilities. They must follow rules to make websites accessible.

**Article 5**

r/marketing

**Title: Design and User Experience: Crucial for Website Success**

**User experience** is the main goal of web design. A website's design must match its brand and needs. The site should be simple to move around on. It must feel natural. The best teams do user research. They ask how we, the users, use the site. They make things easy for us. They create user personas, like stories, so they understand us. Good user interface is not just nice looking, but also very easy to use. It is important that **website design** appeals to our audience.

r/freelance

**Title: Process and Communication: The Foundation of a Smooth Web Design Project**

How a team works is very important. Good process and project management are needed to work well. We must know their way of doing things. The best teams communicate often. It is important they give us updates and are clear with what is going on. They must be easy to talk to and understand. A good company sticks to the schedule and the budget. We need a **web design team** that will be reliable. These are the traits of a strong partner. It makes a project less stressful. **On-time delivery** is a must for a good team.

**Article 7**

r/web\_design

**Title: Pricing and Value: Making Smart Financial Decisions**

**Web design** does not have fixed prices. Costs can change a lot. A clear pricing structure is important. The best teams do not hide charges. There is a difference between **custom websites** and templates. We must know this cost and the benefit of each. A custom design can cost more. But it can also fit our exact needs. A lower price is not always the best value. So, it is important to check our return on this investment. We must decide if results justify the costs. It is important to focus on value, not just price.

**Article 8**

r/SEO

**Title: Client Reviews and Testimonials: What Others Are Saying**

We must look at what other clients say. Look for real **website design reviews**. Check many sites like Google Reviews, Clutch, or Trustpilot. It can be helpful to find common patterns. Do most people say good things or bad things? The reviews must agree with the case studies. If a review says a company is great, it needs to show that in their results. We must check a lot of reviews, both good and bad, to see a clear picture. This shows us how **web design** is helping real people.

---

**Article 9**

r/digital\_marketing

**Title: SEO and Marketing Integration: Designing for Growth**

**Web design** must have SEO in mind. A good team knows how to design a website for search engines. They also must help with **website analytics**. Good teams track results and show us data. They tell us how many people come to the website and how they act. If a team does not know SEO or data tracking, it is not a good fit for us. A great website does not just look nice. It also helps us reach more customers. We need a team that is strong in **SEO and web marketing**.

---

**Article 10**

r/analytics

**Title: Data and Statistics: Real Numbers for Real Results**

What are the real results of web design? Let‚Äôs check some numbers. **Website speed** is very important for user experience. Most of the traffic comes from mobile devices now. This is what we call mobile usage. Good design will increase conversion rates, the percentage of people taking action on our sites. We must track these things to see if our website design works. When we make our website better for users, we also see a good return on our investment. So, real metrics show real results. **Website performance metrics** are key to success.

**Article 11**

r/userexperience

**Title: Understanding Experimentation: Testing and Optimizing Your Website**

It is a good idea to test our website. A/B testing is important. We try two versions of a page to see which one works better. The best teams do usability tests. They watch users use the site to see what is confusing or hard. They use performance audits, too. They check for things that slow down the site. They make our website work better through experimentation. **Usability testing** reveals how users behave. So it‚Äôs important that we keep testing to make our site the best it can be. This helps us to make our sites work best for us.

After Helly's cold open, Mark reads a list of his responsibilities to prepare the work day. First thing he does is refill the coffee maker with water.

When Mark is on his date, they both have wine glasses filled with water. Wine is often considered a delicacy. Perhaps this hints that for some reason, water too is a delicacy. 

Helly asks Dylan what he thinks the numbers could represent. He responds  >! ""My theory? The sea."" !< He then proceeds to give an abstract and frankly ridiculous explanation as to way he thinks so. But as ridiculous as it may seem, he might not be far from the truth. Breadcrumbs?

While Irving is in wellness, he is told his outie values water.

Lastly, the episode ends with >! Petey getting integration sickness while he is in the shower. !<

As an honorable mention its raining for a lot of this episode, though that could've just been done for the tone of the scenes.

The episode is largely focused on figuring out what the numbers symbolize, and it just so happens it starts, ends, and is littered with mentions of water. Could the numbers have something to do with water? Are there more significant mentions of water in this episode or later in the series?

For as long as I can remember, I've always had trouble sleeping. I was teenager by the time I realized it wasn't normal to lay awake for two or three hours before finally falling asleep, and even then, I only sleep for a couple hours. I tried everything to ease my condition. I've tried melatonin, sleeping pills, exercise, alcohol, marijuana, white noise, warm milk, sensory deprivation, therapy, Ambien, hypnosis, magnesium supplements, valerian root, changing my diet, tea, Ativan, yoga, hot baths, ice baths... the list goes on and on. Most things didn't work at all, and the few that did would result in me not getting any *restful* sleep. I've had doctors look me over and paid way too much for a battery of tests to identify a cause. Nothing was ever found, so I almost gave up and just accepted that I would be tired forever. However, a while ago, I finally found something that helped.

I started keeping a notepad on my nightstand next to my bed.

I would write down whatever I was thinking about, just letting my thoughts flow onto the page. The first time I tried it, I settled into bed with the pen and paper and just started writing whatever came to my mind.

‚ÄúI'm in bed. I want to sleep. I wish I could find out what it's like to dream.‚Äù

That was the first thing I wrote. Then, I was waking up the next morning feeling refreshed for the first time I could remember in my life. I actually cried a little once I realized I had slept for eight full hours. If that seems like an over reaction, you've never suffered from severe long term insomnia.

I looked back over the notebook after I calmed down a bit, just to see what all I had written. I remembered the first three sentences, but there was a little more after that.

‚ÄúI hear a voice in the void. It is screaming. I can hear you.‚Äù

I didn't think too much of this, just chalking it up to ramblings of a man on the edge of somnolence, but it did creep me out a little. However, I didn't think about it beyond that as I went through my day.

The next night, I settled in a started jotting on the notepad.

‚ÄúWas it a fluke? Will this work again? I hope I dream this time.‚Äù

I woke up the next morning after that feeling even better than I had the first time. I had a dream of an endless range of beautiful mountains that I was flying through. It was the most beautiful experience of my life. I looked over the pad to see if there would be anymore strange writing there, and I was not disappointed.

‚ÄúEnjoy the dream.‚Äù

I was more than a little rattled by this. It was so simple that I could easily dismiss it, but it stuck in my mind like a splinter. I thought about it all that day, unable to shake the cancerous thought. I kept telling myself that I had written it on the edge of sleep and probably felt the dream coming on. It was probably something I wrote while on the edge of consciousness and I just wanted to tell myself to enjoy the experience. I mean, I did enjoy it immensely. I think it was the first dream I had ever had. Still, I felt a little unnerved by it all.

I settled back into my bed for the third night and pulled out the notepad and pen. I took a few deep breaths and let my thoughts wander freely from my head to the page.

‚ÄúI loved the dream last night. I've never felt this good in my entire life. The weird messages are a little creepy, but I shouldn't let it get to me.‚Äù

That night, I dreamed of laying in my backyard, staring up at the stars twinkling like ice shards in the black sky. My fire pit was crackling lazily next to me. I couldn't see it from my position, but I could actually feel the warmth of the flames safe guarding me against the chill of the evening. It wasn't as exciting as flying around the mountains in my previous dream, but I didn't mind that. It was peaceful.

I woke up and looked at the notepad, wondering what strange note I had left myself this time.

‚ÄúDon't let it unnerve you. Just watch the stars. You'll soon walk among them.‚Äù

The peace of the dream faded immediately as I read that final sentence. There was something sinister about it that I couldn't place my finger on. Walk among the stars? What the hell did that mean?

I felt a strange sense of foreboding for the rest of the day. I work at a warehouse as a certified forklift operator, which means my mind has plenty of opportunities to wander as I load pallets onto trucks or stack them in designated holding areas. The whole day, as I listened to the drone of the forklift's motorized workings, I kept wondering what that final message meant and kept coming up with nothing. I was still adjusting to all the extra energy the sleep was providing me with though, so I wasn't ready to stop using the notepad method yet.

I got home and actually felt energetic enough to cook myself a nice dinner of pan seared pork chops with fried apple and onion slices, then deglazed the pan with chicken stock and added ground mustard seed as well as butter to make a sweet and savory sauce to top it with. It was exquisite, and by the time I finished eating, all my anticipation had drained away.

I got in bed and reached for my pen and notepad to begin jotting down whatever came into my mind.

‚ÄúI've decided I'm going to stop stressing over these notes I'm leaving for myself. It's worth it to have a good night's sleep. I wonder what weird messages I'll leave for myself tonight?‚Äù

That's as much as I remember writing. That night, I had another dream. I was standing in front of a mirror, but the reflection was hazy, as if I was trying to look through a thick fog. The result was a dark silhouette standing in the mirror, leaning closer as I leaned closer and shifting when I shifted. I was transfixed by the reflection, curious as to what it looked like, but unable to clearly make it out. I reached a hand to my face and rubbed my chin in thought, then jolted awake as the figure suddenly waved a hand of its own volition.

My heart was pounding in my ears as I sat upright in my bed. I felt a pang of dread as I leaned over to look at my notepad. The message this time obliterated any chance for dismissing the notes as meaningless.

‚ÄúThere not from yourself. I see you.‚Äù

I didn't use the notepad that night. I just laid there, too scared to sleep, no matter how desperately I wanted to. Unfortunately, I had become acclimated to sleeping regularly, and the exhaustion I felt as I watched the night sky through my window turn from black to gray was worse than it had ever been. I almost called into work, but forced myself to go through the motions anyways.

I started feeling dumb, realizing I was being paranoid. I had cost myself the perfection of a night's rest and purchased miserable lethargy in its stead. It was a fool's bargain and I decided I would put my fears to the side this evening. I was still afraid of what these messages meant, but I was more afraid to go back to the hell that takes the place of the world when one is denied nocturnal respite.

I got into my bed and picked up the pen and notepad, hesitating only a moment as my eyes lingered on that final message. I shook the thought from my head, and pushed on.

‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. I'm myself. I'm leaving these notes. There is no other explanation. I'm done with being afraid.‚Äù

It was short and sweet, right to the point. I felt my eyes grow heavy as I was barely able to finish that last word and the ocean of sleep pulled me beneath its heavenly waves. Yet, those heavenly waves washed me ashore on the beaches of hell itself.

I was in some sort of dark cavern, the only light coming from guttering torches planted in the stone floor. They were scattered all about the enormous space, but seemed concentrated around some sort of throne with a dark figure sitting on it. It was hard to focus on the figure, like its body was wreathed in twisting tendrils of smoke. I could see it was covered in chains though. I felt myself being drawn to the base of the great stone chair, like a current pulling me inexorably along, no matter how hard I kicked against it. I stood before the throne and could feel the creature staring at me, though I wasn't even sure if it had eyes.

I felt my hand reach out and was surprised to see I was holding a weathered key. The figure gestured at a lock resting at the foot of the throne. I didn't want to unlock it, fearing what this hellish thing full of malevolence would wrought upon me when it was unbound, but once again, I was powerless to halt myself. I inserted the key and the lock popped open with a loud click.

And then my eyes opened and I was laying in my bed. I was covered in sweat and shivering. I could see the notepad sitting there on the nightstand, glaring up at me with the same threatening aura I had felt emanating from the thing on the throne. With a shaking hand, I picked it up and read the newest message.

‚ÄúYou are my bridge now. You are my dream. The throne awaits.‚Äù

I had been convincing myself that all of this were just ramblings, that I was suffering from paranoia, but I decided in that moment that something horrible was happening. I threw the notepad across the room, feeling tears well up in my eyes. I felt sick, but didn't hesitate to get out of bed.

I went downstairs to make coffee and fought the twin urges to put all of this out of my mind while also trying to make sense of it. Both attempts were futile.

I was also horrified to see I had slept for twelve hours. It is the longest I'd ever slept in my life. I decided then and there that I would not be using the notepad again. If I was doomed to never sleep a day again in my life, so be it. I'd rather die exhausted than let that... thing... have its way.

I went through my day as normal, doing my laundry, cleaning my home, shopping for groceries. As the banality of the day dragged on, I felt the tension filling my body began to ease a little. After all, life would continue as it had before the notepad. It may not be pleasant, but it would be familiar.

Unfortunately, that night I experienced a sensation I had never felt before. As the day degraded into night, I felt a strange heaviness around my eyes and realized that must be what it feels like to be sleepy. I fought the feeling all the way until midnight, then could fight it no longer. I laid down in my bed, spying the notepad from across the room laying on the floor where I had thrown it. If I had the energy, I would of gotten up and thrown it in the garbage, but I couldn't have left my bed if my house had been on fire.

The mounting dread did nothing to stay the hand of drowsiness that pulled my eyelids down, down, down into a darkness so complete that even my thoughts were dark blanks. After a while, I began to see pinpricks of light in the darkness, which confused me. I still felt like I was awake, but there they were, a multitude of stars shining from the inky well of the void I was in.

I was in a starry abyss, and by my side, though it was hard to make out, was the smoke wreathed figure walking with me. It spoke to me, spoke through me. It was my own voice, but the thing had hijacked it to communicate with me.

‚ÄúKneel before me and you shall walk among the stars.‚Äù

Suddenly, the stars winked out and I was shrouded in the darkness once more. For a moment, there was no light and no sound, but that only lasted for a couple seconds. Suddenly, I was on fire. My skin was burning and I tried to scream, but the silence persisted as I was consumed. I could feel my muscles contracting as they cooked, twisting me into a fetal position as I quivered in agony. The thing spoke again with my voice.

‚ÄúStand against me and you shall burn.‚Äù

I woke up on the floor next to my bed. I must have been thrashing around in my sleep because my blankets and sheets were twisted around me To my absolute horror, the notepad was next to me, and in large words that were hastily scrawled across the entire page was a new message.

‚ÄúI am near.‚Äù

I looked at the clock and saw I had slept for fourteen hours. I called into my job and explained to my boss that I was sick, which wasn't exactly a lie. He wasn't happy, but accepted the explanation easily enough. I spent the day shopping for supplies for the evening. I was going to fight this. I would try everything to avoid kneeling before it.

I bought coffee and energy drinks, enough to give a rhino a heart attack. Hell, I'd of bought cocaine if I knew where to get drugs.

I got home and even though the sun was only just setting, I could feel that same sensation of exhaustion creeping into my body. I sat on my couch and began drinking all the caffeine I could. It didn't seem to help, and anger began to seep through me. I stormed upstairs and grabbed that damn notepad, went into my backyard and burned it. As the flames devoured the notepad, I thought of the dream where I had been on fire and shuttered. I couldn't shake the recognition of how similar the black flakes of burning paper were to my skin in the dream. Still, after the notepad was reduced to ash, I felt a little better. I went back inside and continued drinking energy drinks while watching TV.

I glanced at the clock every so often, noting the slow passage of time. Each hour felt like another victory, and before long, I was watching the sun dissolve the night sky. I had made it. I felt a bittersweet happiness, longing to feel the rest I had felt when I first used the notepad, but decided a pyrrhic victory was better than a total loss.

I got dressed and headed to work, attempting to return to some routine. I felt less and less tired as I went through the motions, driving my forklift and moving product about the warehouse. As I worked, my boss yelled my name out and waved me down. I got off the forklift and made my way to him.

‚ÄúFeeling better?‚Äù

‚ÄúYea, I think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, we need all hands right now. Next time, if you're not going to be able to make it, make sure to call earlier. It gives me time to line up another driver on the schedule to cover your spot.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes sir. Sorry about that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's alright, just try to be better about it. The reason I waved you down though is someone is in the front office to see you. Seemed important.‚Äù

I felt a little confused, but started heading that way. Truthfully, I didn't have any idea who it could be considering I don't socialize with anyone. That's not an exaggeration, I don't have friends, I don't go out and I don't have any living family. My existence is solitary, a result of my insomnia making it impossible to talk to people for any other reason than necessity.

By the time I reached the office, my mind was racing. I walked in and saw the receptionist look up at me. She was talking on the phone and held up a single finger, silently mouthing the words ‚Äúone moment.‚Äù

I took a seat on one of the cheap chairs against the wall and politely waited for her to finish. She hung up the phone after a while and called out to me.

‚ÄúSorry to keep you waiting, there's a man to see you in the conference room.‚Äù

I nodded my appreciation and made the short walk to the conference room. I walked in and screamed as I saw what was on the other side of the door.

The conference room was gone. In its place was the dark cavern with the throne. The unchained and smoke shrouded figure stood up as I walked in and seemed to grow taller as it did so. I turned to run, but the door had vanished behind me. I collapsed to the ground, gasping for air as the fire began to consume me once more. The thing slowly walked towards me until it loomed over me, its dark form vanishing in a wreath of flames and smoke from my smoldering skin.

I heard it speak, this time in a voice that sounded like stone on stone mixed with the crackle of fire.

‚ÄúI have arrived.‚Äù

I woke up in my bedroom, my whole body aching. As my eyes adjusted, I could see the walls of my bedroom had large words covering every inch of them.

‚ÄúI have arrived.‚Äù

The message was scrawled over and over again. My heart was beating in my ears and I screamed aloud in frustration. I checked my phone and saw I had been asleep for almost two days.

I know this will be my last few moments of consciousness. I don't know how I know that, but I do. I know that I have a choice to make. I've become convinced that the entity doing this to me is the devil, or some kind of demon. It is something of pure evil. If it comes through into our world, it will bring about the end of everything.

I don't know why this has happened to me. I'm not sure that matters anymore. I have to choose if I'm going to kneel and damn everyone to this things machinations or pick the other option.

I wanted to send out this last message to the world I hardly ever spoke to. No one may read it and even those that do will likely never care, but I needed to make sure there was some record of what I've done and why I've done it. This isn't just my way of seeking some measure of solace in glorifying myself, or expressing self pity for my plight. This is my warning to you all. There is a thing wreathed in smoke and darkness, a thing that is trying to break into our world. I know it will not stop until it does. All it needs is someone to kneel to it.

I took a long time thinking this through, unsure if there was any other thing I could I do in my situation. Finally, I've come to the conclusion that there is no other way. This is not a decision that I made easily, but one I agonized over for as long as I could. I want to keep fighting, but I know that I've lost. Yet, even in my defeat, I can deny this enemy its most prized asset.

I'm looking at the rope hanging before me. I'm full of fear and misery, wishing there was any other thing I could do, but I feel my eyes growing heavy once again and know that I must act now. I won't have another chance once I slip away again.

If you ever wake up to find messages you don't remember writing and are visited by a smoke shrouded figure in your dreams, you must make this same choice.

My life has been a difficult one, full of loneliness and exhaustion. I fear the end of it none the less. Despite this, I still rather choose this than choose to kneel to that monster.

At least now, I can finally sleep.",1,1738560861.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Ok so I work at a grocery store and me and my best friend work shifts together but for awhile since I have worked there she leaves for a long time and puts all the work onto me. Today she went to give a dude she has a crush on ice cream cone cupcakes we made the night before during our busiest hour. She leaves for a while I get a line so I call her down she seems a little annoyed but wtv and then she wants to give the dude she likes his friend some of the treats because he said so. I said your really gonna leave in annoyed and snarky tone then I tell her to go but she doesn‚Äôt. So then when I don‚Äôt have a line she leaves to give it to the friend and then leaves to the coffee shop for awhile to talk crap on me she comes back I get us spoons because my mom was bringing us dinner but she was made at me so I texted her I was sorry if I got sharp and explained my side she opened the message but didn‚Äôt read it. I was holding back tears my mom came and then my friend grabs the food and leaves to the coffee shop to talk more crap she finally comes back after almost an hour of me doing all work and her doing nothing. I go up to the managers office to tell him while in tears and he said he noticed it too. And then I start cleaning all the check stands and self check out. She gets mad at me for cleaning because it‚Äôs her closing shift I don‚Äôt need to clean and all mad. She goes to the coffee shop again to complain about me again. While I take care of costumers. And then we are decorating the place for Valentine‚Äôs Day and she talks to me about telling the manager about what happened. Then yells  at me about how she is gonna lose her job because of me and screams and keeps blaming me (she says the manager would never fire her) I told her no it‚Äôs gonna be a slap on the wrist.  And she leaves and goes to the coffee shop to talk about me again. Then she blocks me on snap and never apologized to me and said we shouldn‚Äôt be friends while I apologized about being sharp to her. But we have had a fight about her not doing her job before and I finally was fed up so AITAH?",1,1738560240.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

So I match with this guy in hinge back in October 15th ish. We hit it off. He‚Äôs currently in another state just about to move and he‚Äôs moving to the area that I am in.
 First month- is us just chatting on hinge. And the texting is long in-depth 1-2 paragraph messages from both of us. Maybe once or twice a day from both of us. We find we have a lot of the same likes and dislikes, values and morals and its great right. 

 Nov 11th ish-he finally moves in to the area I‚Äôm in and we actually go on a date that night he moved in. We went for dinner, explored his apartment, and just chatted for about 5hrs it was going to well. That week we go on 2 more dates that go just as well. 

Then I had to go out of town for 2 weeks. But get back, and have another amazing date and a couple hang outs after work with him. More chatting about what we both want, and like and he even suggests we take some trips together as we are both now relatively new to the area. He initiated it, was even looking at booking tickets. He even initiates some more intimacy. And I personally didn‚Äôt want to have sex so soon, I wanted to wait and clearly told him that to which he agreed he wanted to as well. It was all very openly discussed. 

So in my mind, I‚Äôm ready for him to ask me to be his gf, make a commitment. I know we are on the same page about values/morals/religion/finances even/and future plans like family and lifestyle. 

Dec5- texting him
Me: I asked if we are official? (I should have just asked what we are) 
Him: responded he wanted to wait and not rush things, that a couple months of dating would do us no harm. But was ‚Äú100% interested in me and exclusively so, no on hinge, not planning on changing that. A couple months of dating won‚Äôt hurt us if we are in it for the long haul(which I definitely am) ‚Äú
And I guess I was taken aback because he was doing all the boyfriend things and me all the girlfriend things. He was literally planning his work schedule to see what fits mine so we can do trips up through March of this year. But I did reflect, we‚Äôd only really been seeing each other for not even a month, he was probably right. And I said so, that thats a good idea. Then called me, he wanted to have the discussion over a call(which I really did appreciate). And the convo went something like this. 
Him: are you ok do you agree with what I said
Me: yea, I think I just misread some things, but agree with what you said. I think I just need to step back from some of the intimacy stuff (all we‚Äôd done was touchy stuff not actual sex as we both communicated we wanted to wait). 
Him: oh I wasn‚Äôt thinking that, but ok. 
Me: yea its ok. I think we just take a step back and focus on our friendship like you said, and  date for awhile longer. 
Him: *thinks for a bit* I guess I can‚Äôt really think of a reason why we shouldn‚Äôt be together though. 
Me: *half crying because I feel rejected and just wanting to do the right thing*Lets just focus on dating and getting to know each other, as you said and go from there. 
So he says ok, and then asks if I want to come over that night to which I do. 

That night I‚Äôm a little off, which I feel is normal, I just basically threw myself at a guy I had known for a month in person and was told I needed to slow down. But he then asks me if I want to be his gf. And I think I may have totally fuck this up, but also feel like I made the logical right decision. When he asked I told him: you dan‚Äôt really ask me now..I mean..I do..but I don‚Äôt want to make you ask me to be your gf. 
And then he says nothing and the convo just ended. And I‚Äôm fully aware that he could have felt offended by this but i just wanted to do the right thing. I didn‚Äôt want him feeling pressured to commit, since that morning he seemed pretty sure about dating longer before slapping a label on it.  

So the day after he tells me he's sick with a bug vomiting, which proceed to go on Dec 6,7,8. He sounded miserable and I hadn‚Äôt heard from him, though I understand he was sleeping and just resting up. Anyway I offered to bring him soup and did so that Monday Dec 9th. I put so much work into it and dropped it off, and he invited me in, and one thing led to the next and we almost had sex, but I stopped it. And then I left, but there were no bad vibes when I left. 

Throughout that week we just kinda hung out after work, and watched movies. It was still nice and he‚Äôd even drop by after his late night shifts for about 30mins or so before going home. 

Dec 12th I go to my door and he‚Äôs left me flowers. It was very sweet and I called and chatted with him a couple time that week too since we weren‚Äôt seeing each other. We are also texting a couple times a day, very lightly, nothing crazy and not really small talk.  Well then he asks and plans for us to go on an iceskating date Dec 14. I‚Äôm to stay at his place Dec 13th, get coffee with him Dec 14 morning and go ice skating. Mind he is a nurse so he works long hrs. 

Dec13-he cancels me staying over b/c work has been long but suggest stopping by later that night instead. He then doesn‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt here from him. -I‚Äôm no bothered I get that he‚Äôs tired I get it work was long and rough. 

Dec 14. Its 11:00 and still haven‚Äôt heard from him about time and plans for our date, so I text him to see how its going. Don‚Äôt hear back until 2:00pm. Then ask if we are still on for ice skating. Its now 3:00 and no answer. I already had a prior commitment at 6:00 that he knew about that evening so this date was not happening and I hate waiting for the guy who made the plans to let me know what was happening and just told him that I wasn‚Äôt feeling it. He was happy, said I was the best because he didn‚Äôt want to cancel it thinking I‚Äôd be let down. Well I was infact very much let down, he should have just told me when he got up that morning to tell me plans were canceled not waiting until mid afternoon. I played it off and just said its fine, we‚Äôll reschedule

The next 2 days he doesn‚Äôt reach out or text so I message him to check in. He then suggests coming and visiting me Dec 17 

Dec 17-he visits, is exhausted from work and sleep for awhile then starts making out and tries having sex again, to which I told him no. We‚Äôd discussed it. But I did ask-‚ÄúAre we going to have sex?‚Äù. 
Him: We shouldn‚Äôt

And I really wanted to ask if sex was a deal breaker for him. Because despite communicating and agreeing with me about not having sex. He was still initiating it. And I‚Äôm ok with all the external stuff, and touching but he‚Äôd keep going to where I thought we were actually going to do it. 
I‚Äôm also leaving Dec 23rd to go home for the holidays so I ask if I can see him again, he‚Äôs off Dec 11th, but says he can‚Äôt he has a report to write (he had this a week ago and was working on it). 

So later he leaves after just chatting. And then I heard nothing from him the next couple days. I had sent him an instagram reel a few days ago-unopened, same with a snapchat,both of which we were consistently sending, but nothing excessive. Like one or 2 a day. 
Come Friday I ask if he wanted to hang out, but he‚Äôs working everyday that week. 12hr shifts every day so I know he‚Äôs tired. And he makes no effort to see me that I guess thats that. 

I text him I‚Äôm leaving and then ghosted the entire Christmas week. I accept that he‚Äôs lost interest. But he still has my pot I made the soup I made him. That pot is expensive so I just ask if I can get it back. And he drops it off after work. (Dec 30). He takes no move to try to knock on the door and talk to me just walks away. And he knows I‚Äôm home. I watched him walk away and it hurt so much. 

2 weeks later Jan 12. I text him. (Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have but I couldn‚Äôt figure out what happened. 
Me: What happened between up
Him: Idk i think some bad communicating habits on my part. I‚Äôm watching lord of the rings if you want to join. 
Me: hmmmm
Him: that sounds like a loaded ‚Äúhmm‚Äù. Considerate it a belated birthday. (His bday)
Me: No. 

I tried keeping it short and sweet. I feel like all the advise you get here is ‚Äúsilence is the best communication‚Äù and I just couldn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd ghost me after what felt like love bombing, and then when I reached out he asks to hang out, but in a non intentional like ‚Äúi want to see you‚Äù way. And also request it as a bday present. Like wtf. I had also checked his hinge profile and one of his pictures had changed. 


Anyway its been 2 more weeks later and I‚Äôve cried so much. Like I think I actually loved the guy. And it just hurts so much. And its ridiculous. I knew the guy for such a short time. 

I just need to know what you all think. What did I do wrong. Or was it just him being an asshole or a player. Idk. I can‚Äôt figure it out. I keep replaying every-bit in my mind.  I just need some peace.

I haven‚Äôt had any tests or anything yet but just had a day of eating stuff I haven‚Äôt in almost a month: Tabasco on my breakfast with coffee, soy sauce and creole seasoning on my stirfry bowl. I had very little to no inflammation. 

I think it‚Äôs just been 2 weeks since I had my most recent - worst reaction of inflammation. Between then and now I made a commitment to a bland balanced diet, no coffee, alcohol, sugar of any kind, and (multiple) all natural supplements.

I‚Äôve honestly never felt healthier and cleaner before in my life and love what I‚Äôve been doing, you as well will thank yourself for doing this.

This includes people who *do* not watch Formula 1.

But for these same people, if I were to ask what contributes to the outcome of the race, everyone would jump to the conclusion that it's the driver.

A fair assumption, but those who watch Formula 1 know that the car contributes significantly to the outcome, as much as the driver does.

Every nut and bolt, every bit of technology you can squeeze in, all contribute to the outcome of the race.

The car is more than just a vehicle in this scenario; it's a tool.

Can we not do the same with physical products?

Nike does not sell shoes.

This isn't just an opinion; it was mentioned by their Chief, Muge Erdirik Dogan.

They sell the tools needed for athletes to perform.

You want to jump higher? Buy Nike shoes.

You want to run faster? Buy Nike shoes.

They are not denying the contribution the athletes make, but those last few centimeters of height or seconds in time needed to make a difference, to change the outcome, are only possible through Nike (or at least, that's what they claim).

They believe that they are part of the journey of their consumers and have solved the majority of pain points.

Some of which include:

1. What can we do to propel our athletes faster on the track?
2. What materials should it be made of so it can be lighter and more durable?
3. How will comfort affect endurance?

After all of the above has been addressed, the question arises: It has to now look like a shoe!

Function is as important as aesthetic appeal.

If you can provide unique tools within what is a mundane, everyday physical good, you will gain immediate interest, as it feels very personal and special.

1. A lamp that can extend as a tool to hold your books.
2. A mug that can also be a tool to warm up your coffee.
3. Gym attire that can monitor your heartbeat.

I know what I'm thinking, but slow at understanding my feelings, and oblivious to what men feel about me unless pursued relentlessly (which turns out not to be the best kind of guy). He's a 10, but a workaholic, quiet introvert, but assertive in bed, the tenderest bean in the manliest body.

We met on an app, vibe well, similar taste in music, art, movies, and have compatible views on religion, politics, quality of life, and philosophy. We have long comfortable silences and feel super relaxed around each other. Oh and the sex is amazing, keeps getting better. We've both had some exceptionally bad relationships which is why we've been reluctant to get involved in something long term again (despite a lot of therapy) and we both have demanding careers that can frequently go past 40hrs a week, which not many people are on board for.

We've had some relationship talks about how he's questioning his stance on only doing short term things specifically because of me, about where we are on kids, our aversions to living with another person out of our respective fears of being trapped again, where we want to live, career goals, etc. We haven't talked about being exclusive or official, but we do know neither of us is seeking out anyone else at this point. It's vague and that's fine because slow is what I need.

He's incredibly conscientious about his work and towards me, and so supportive of what I do. I'm not particularly romantic or good at expressing feelings in words, so I do my best to let him know he's appreciated with a lot physical affection (not just the sexy kind), compliments and thanks for what I like about him and what he does for me.

Last weekend, because this isn't defined, I referred to us as ""whatever this is"" (not meant as a jab, just what popped out of my mouth during our convo) and I wish I had slowmo for the cascade of facial expressions that went across his face in under a second after I said that.

During the week, he said he was worried that he's not putting enough effort into this, that he needs to figure out how to make more time to see me (work has been really busy), and wanted to know what he could do better because he feels like I do a lot for him. I told him I'm very happy with him and gave examples of things he does for me that are meaningful. I also said that it's on me too to let him know what I want and acknowledged I don't leave him a lot of opportunities to do things for me because I'm not good at asking for help and used to doing things myself.

Last night over dinner, he told me that he was glad I wound up moving here after my divorce. This morning while we were buried under blankets after waking up, I told him I'm glad I met him and he asked ""where were you all my life?"" My response was ""busy getting myself in a lot of trouble"". He mumbled something about feelings that I couldn't make out and quickly got up and said he was going to make us coffee. And since he left this afternoon, I've intermittently been haunted with the thought that I maybe fumbled him trying to tell me something.

I'm pretty dense about this kind of thing, but now I'm wondering is he trying to show me that he wants a more serious relationship? I don't want him to think I'm rejecting him. Should I be direct and ask where he's at on this? Should I let him know that's he's succeeding at worming his way into my dumb heart? Or do I let him try again and hopefully he's a bit more direct?

1ighgjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricTeethbrush/comments/1ighgjc/can_an_electric_toothbrush_remove_black_stains/,Can an Electric Toothbrush Remove Black Stains? Here‚Äôs What You Need to Know!,"If you've noticed black stains on your teeth, you're probably wondering if an electric toothbrush can help get rid of them. The short answer? Yes, but with limitations. Let‚Äôs break it down!

#  What Causes Black Stains on Teeth?

Before jumping to solutions, it‚Äôs important to know the cause of these stubborn stains. Black stains can be caused by:

* Tartar buildup ‚Äì Hardened plaque that turns dark over time.
*  Chromogenic bacteria ‚Äì Certain bacteria can create dark-colored deposits on teeth.
*  Smoking & tobacco use ‚Äì Nicotine and tar leave stubborn black stains.
*  Coffee, tea, red wine & cola ‚Äì Dark-colored beverages stain enamel.
*  Iron supplements ‚Äì Can leave black stains, especially in kids.
* Poor oral hygiene ‚Äì Leads to plaque buildup and eventual staining.

#  Can an Electric Toothbrush Help?

An electric toothbrush CAN help remove surface stains (extrinsic stains), but CANNOT remove deep stains embedded in enamel or tartar. Here‚Äôs why:

* High-Speed Brushing Action ‚Äì Removes plaque & minor stains more effectively than a manual brush.
*  Better Coverage ‚Äì The oscillating/sonic movements clean areas manual brushing often misses.
*  Prevents Stains from Setting ‚Äì Regular use helps prevent new stains from forming.



However, if the black stains are due to tartar buildup or deep discoloration, an electric toothbrush alone won‚Äôt be enough. You‚Äôll need professional dental cleaning.

#  Best Electric Toothbrush for Removing Stains

To get the best results, look for an electric toothbrush with these features:

*  Sonic or oscillating technology ‚Äì Helps break down plaque efficiently.
* Pressure sensor ‚Äì Prevents aggressive brushing that can harm enamel.
*  Whitening mode ‚Äì Some brushes come with specialized stain-removal settings.
*  Soft or medium bristles ‚Äì Harsh bristles can damage enamel and gums.

 Top Picks: Philips Sonicare DiamondClean, Oral-B iO Series, and Burst Sonic Toothbrush.

 Extra Tips to Remove & Prevent Black Stains

* Use a Whitening Toothpaste ‚Äì Helps lift surface stains gradually.
* Floss Daily ‚Äì Removes plaque between teeth, preventing stain buildup.
*  Try Baking Soda & Hydrogen Peroxide ‚Äì A natural stain remover (use sparingly).
* Limit Staining Foods & Drinks ‚Äì Cut down on coffee, tea, and wine.
*  Visit Your Dentist Regularly ‚Äì Professional cleanings remove deep stains and tartar.

So, while an electric toothbrush is a great tool for keeping your teeth clean and preventing stains, it‚Äôs not a magic eraser for black stains that are already set in. If your stains persist, book a dental checkup ASAP!

**Title:**¬†AITAH for being upset my girlfriend put an AirTag on my motorcycle to prove a point to her mom?

I've never made a reddit post on this sub before but I read posts from here occasionally. I am going to make my submission as concise as possible but I'm not a great storyteller and this whole thing is a little more nuanced than my shitty ability to articulate it.

I'm 27M and my girlfriend is 33F.

Although our relationship started out very intense and unpredictable, we quickly developed strong feelings and have been together for 3 years. Despite being together that long.. I just met my girlfriend's parents for the first time a few weeks ago.

She is an only child and said she didn't want to introduce anyone she dated to her parents unless she knew this was the person she wanted to marry. Her parents also live abroad and due to Covid and her dad's health problems, they didn't visit her for a while, she usually went to visit them. It was a big step for her to tell me she wanted me to meet them and I did my best to make a good impression.

I was raised by my grandmother. When she passed, my older sister took over caring for me. My girlfriend has had a stable upbringing. Her parents are wealthy and she's led a privileged life. We don't have the same life experiences and it was never a problem until I met her parents. If anything, for some reason the differences between us added to our relationship in ways.

Unfortunately, I got the impression her parents were scrutinizing every aspect of my life over the dinner we had on our first meeting and this included my family. I stayed true to myself and maintained my confidence but left the interaction feeling like I bombed a test. My girlfriend reassured me they liked me.

But her mood over the few days afterward suggested otherwise. I called her out on it and pressed her for an explanation. I learned she's been upset because of a fight she had with her mother following the dinner. Her mother thinks I'm just having fun with her daughter, that I will get bored and leave her and she's too old to be wasting time with me. Apparently, her mother got this impression entirely from the way I look and this judgment about me trumps anything else I shared about myself.

My girlfriend and I decided to have me spend more time with her family over the coming holidays so I have been going over every day and involving myself in shopping trips etc with my girlfriend and her mom, hoping that she would get to know me and overcome whatever skepticism she has. I even spent hours getting a crash course in a strategy board game her dad plays and started playing with him to continue learning it as a form of bonding.

Despite feeling like I won her dad over, I felt like her mom was constantly evaluating my loyalty in subtle (unrealistic) ways. Examples include overanalyzing how I interact with others in public, reading too much into the way I smile (?) and the way I show affection toward my girlfriend.

According to my girlfriend's mom, the fact that I have a motorcycle makes me extra slutty.

And that's how this escalated.

My sister and I have an 18 year old dog. It's been a tough few months for him. I think he's approaching the end. For that reason, usually one of us is always with him. He's on the smaller side, so he's easy to bring along anywhere.

I've had to leave to give medicine to my dog at certain times of the day because he's on a schedule and I guess my girlfriend's mom found even this to be suspicious.

The other day I left my girlfriend and her family to go give my dog his medicine and on my way there my phone alerted that an AirTag was travelling with me. When I reached my place, I searched all my pockets and stuff and eventually found it on the motorcycle itself. It was connected to my girlfriend's mom's number.

I told my girlfriend and my girlfriend said she put her mom's AirTag on my bike to prove to her mom that I was not lying about where I was going.

I get that she was trying to defend me but I feel angry at her.

It's hard to articulate but ever since I met my girlfriend's family, micro aggressions by her mom are really getting to me and it's hard to separate them from my girlfriend. Hoping I'm just overstimulated by all this and things will get better after Christmas is over. I'm not sure if I'm an AH for being cold toward my girlfriend about the AirTag though.. but it's a frustration that I'm having trouble letting go of.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: The most foundational part of a relationship is the trust between two people. The fact that she didn't tell you about it sounds like she also wanted to see what you were doing, because if she trusted you she should have defended you. Parents are and have been skeptical since the first cave person brought another back to their parents. It's up to her and you to convince them otherwise. You seem to have done a lot so it may just come down to direct face to face conversations with the 3 or 4 of you to really hammer this home. Otherwise who knows what else will be done next to ""test your loyalty""?

>**OOP:**¬†That's what I've been struggling with. The fact that she didn't let me in on her plan makes me wonder if she wanted to test me too. Even if that's not the case, the whole approach has pissed me off

Commenter: INFO: If one of you is always with the dog, why did you have to leave to give him his medication?

>**OOP:**¬†So this was on my watch. He just had a nasogastric tube put in and it‚Äôs been more comfortable for him to stay at home vs me taking him out with me in the cold. The distance between my place and my girlfriend‚Äôs is very short.

**Original**¬†[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i0zps6/my_girlfriends_parents_surprised_me_with_a_visit/)**: January 14, 2025 (25 days later)**

I‚Äôm 28 M my girlfriend is 33 F.

We‚Äôve been together for a few years and have discussed getting married. Unfortunately, ever since I met her parents last year, their behaviour (specifically her mom) has made it difficult for me to see a future anymore.

Her mom mistrusts me and it‚Äôs all based on superficial impressions and assumptions about who she thinks I am. I have tried to show her parents patience and I‚Äôve been extremely respectful, giving them opportunities to get to know me and overcome their prejudices.

Everything came to a head when I went to visit my home country. I have a place here and I came to see a friend get married.

Her parents showed up unannounced and requested a ride from the airport. I immediately called my girlfriend despite the time difference because I was in shock. She claims she had no idea about their plans.

They claim it was all impromptu / cheap flight / last minute etc ‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt buy it.

Anyway I picked them up and they‚Äôre currently staying with me in my apartment. They‚Äôve got no itinerary but want me to arrange them to see x y z and of course they need me as translator. Everything is apparently too foreign to them, they‚Äôre lost without me. They refuse to go anywhere without me as an escort.

My girlfriend is apologetic ‚Ä¶ but I just don‚Äôt see her supporting me in dealing with her parents, especially her mom, who is the instigator (the dad has no backbone / is forced to follow her).

I posted another issue a while back too..

My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt support me in setting boundaries, so as her partner I fall into a rock and a hard place type situation..

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being cold and uninviting, or if these people are crazy and my girlfriend is so afraid of them she didn‚Äôt even warn me about something like this

I feel like I can handle anything if she‚Äôs on my side‚Ä¶ but it doesn‚Äôt feel like she is.

Maybe I can‚Äôt be with someone like that..

***OOP's Comment:***

Commenter: Whoa, that's a lot to handle! It's okay to feel upset that your girlfriend didn't warn you. Talk to her honestly about how you feel and that you need her support with her parents. Don't be afraid to set boundaries with them, even if it's hard. If she can't back you up, you might need to rethink things. You deserve a partner who's on your team!

>**OOP:**¬†That‚Äôs exactly it. I need us to be a team. I keep trying to express to her this won‚Äôt work if we‚Äôre not a team

Turbulent\_Ebb5669: Your GF put an airtag on your motorbike last month to prove a point to her mother.

I think it's time to either accept your fate or move on and enjoy some freedom.

**Update**¬†[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i5iyn3/update_my_girlfriends_parents_surprised_me_with_a/)**: January 19, 2025 (5 days later, 1 month from first post)**

I just wanted to clarify some things.

I only met my girlfriend's parents for the first time late November 2024.

The reason I picked them up from the airport instead of abandoning them or telling them to go find a hotel etc, was out of respect for my girlfriend and the relationship I want(ed) to have with her (and her parents).

After the first meeting I had with her parents (in late November that I shared in my¬†[first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hiebjf/aitah_for_being_upset_my_girlfriend_put_an_airtag/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), I confronted my girlfriend. She apologized and eventually her mother did too. Basically, I thought we were past whatever suspicions and mistrust her mother had about me.

Then this happened.

In the last few days, since this began, I have realized some things about my relationship. My girlfriend has been trying to play both sides. She'll tell me one thing and her parents another thing.

She's been hiding some deep trust issues about me and insecurities about our relationship.. mostly her fears about me being unfaithful (I want to be clear that these fears are not because of anything that i've done, it's just how she feels).

She used her parents to convince me it wasn't her craziness.. and I am pretty sure she told her mom how she felt and her mom was willing to be in on it.

I broke up with my girlfriend and asked her parents to leave.

The friend's wedding I went to hit different because of that... But it also made me realize how unhealthy and toxic my relationship was.

I haven't disclosed a lot... but I think I was in an abusive relationship. I am still struggling to accept... that? And there is some shame creeping up that I don't understand... why is it there?

Anyway. Thanks for all the messages. Sorry my writing skills aren't that great. I'm so drained from this situation, I feel like I need to sleep for a month. I don't even feel like writing about any of this but I felt I owed you the conclusion.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: \[...\]¬†*Please do not fold and take that woman back, under any circumstance.*

It sucks, but it is better to be finished with it all..

Best of luck, OP.

>**OOP:**¬†Promise that‚Äôs not happening. The breakup wasn‚Äôt smooth, and she became extremely verbally aggressive. She said a lot of things that can never be unsaid. No matter what happens now, and in spite of all the threats she‚Äôs been making, there‚Äôs no hope for reconciliation. I know when I get back it‚Äôs going to be crazy. I‚Äôm not looking forward to it.  
Editing this because I typo‚Äôd

Commenter: Did the parents leave peacefully, or did they attempt to somehow extend their stay?

>**OOP:**¬†They were dumbfounded. I don't expect them to understand my feelings, so I said the least. I talked to her dad privately and let him know first to arrange a hotel accommodation. I put it on my ex-girlfriend to explain it to them. I told them they can contact her, but I am asking them to leave.  
Also worth mentioning because it makes me angry (I wasn't able to express it in my previous post due to being in shock and distracted by other issues) but her parents have been to my country¬†*several*¬†times. Her mom has gotten tons of small procedures and treatments in my country so I'm not sure why all of a sudden they needed me as an escort. It seemed like she was trying to say she only comes to my country for her treatments but doesn't give a shit about anything else, so that's why she's unfamiliar? These people live in another world, I always feel like I'm going a little bit insane having any form of conversation with them.

Commenter: Sounds like that trip was her parents checking up on him for her because of her insecurities. Glad he bailed on that shit.

>**OOP:**¬†It was definitely to investigate me... I don't think I'll ever know what my ex-girlfriend and her mom were suspicious about. Did they think I'm secretly married or living some kind of a second life? I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to look into my employment history etc.  
I feel so stupid for the kindness I extended to them. I tried to be understanding of every transgression and let my girlfriend gaslight me into thinking I was just misunderstanding things because I didn't have parents growing up.

**\*\*\*\*\*New Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ibnx27/last_update_my_girlfriends_parents_surprised_me/)**: January 27, 2025 (8 days later, 2 weeks from 'Original' Post)\*\*\*\*\***

To those who were worried my ex-girlfriend would trash my place, nothing like that happened.

I talked to her in person. She said I was misunderstanding everything. She began to cry, which was difficult for me. There was a moment where I wanted to forget all of it so I could hug her. I held back because something felt different.

She asked me if I hate her. Obviously, I don't. I said I am tired of feeling like the person I love is not who I thought they were. Ever since she introduced me to her parents (and close friends circle, which I didn't talk about) I have seen a side of her I don't recognize.

After meeting her parents for the first time and the strange behavior started to add up, I gave her an opportunity to come clean. I asked her to tell me everything. I told her I can't help you if you leave me in the dark. I even warned her if I find out later, it's over. Because of the way she chose to answer me during this conversation... every action I took, I held back.

All she had to do was tell me what was going on. I would have helped her take on everything. Instead, she chose to trick me in cruel ways while acting helpless and innocent when I questioned her about it. I shielded her all this time. She manipulated everyone around her, including me.

Everything is confusing now. I look back at all of our time together and feel crazy. I can't differentiate anymore... her true feelings about anything.

She tried to explain the stress of pleasing her friends and family made her act this way but she doesn't share their views or doubts about me. She said she's never loved anyone the way she loves me and her feelings scare her. I wish she would just admit she had too much fucking pride.

I understand she is the way she is probably due to how she was raised. But some of the things she has said and done are unforgivable. The conversation went on but everything was still other people's fault. She wasn't taking any accountability.

So I stood by my decision (to stay broken up).

To be honest.. by hesitating for even that singular moment when I wanted to hold her, she showed me the side of her that comes out when she doesn't get her way. For the first time, I felt like what I was seeing is actually her true self.

We were having this conversation while walking outside. We had stopped walking and she was wiping her tears. When she realized I wasn't going to comfort her, she started to say degrading things about me. She also brought it up again that my life is easier than hers because I grew up with no parents. This comment was so fucked up it made me laugh. I told her she's so privileged she has no idea what it even means to have a hard life.

Because I laughed, I could tell she wanted to throw her coffee at me (she didn't). Instead, she said some more things about me and I realized I don't care anymore because I don't even recognize this woman who is yapping in front of me.

Since then, she has emailed me an excel spreadsheet of all the money I owe. The things she has itemized are things like ... all the times she upgraded me on a flight, luxury gifts she has bought me on birthdays, Christmas etc. She also included ridiculous things like estimated cost of gas x amount of times when she was my designated driver. And pregnancy tests ( I think she added this just to mess with me). I'm not going to bother explaining my contributions. This email made me sick.

I packed her things that were in my apartment.

I had a friend come over when she came to collect them. She didn't know this. I answered the door and she pushed against me and tried to initiate. I didn't return her advance and she got angry and scratched me. I think maybe she was trying to slap me but couldn't reach. I'm not really sure because it happened too fast and I restrained her.

My friend came out and began calling her on it. He made a show of taking a video and threatened her with assault. I think it embarrassed her so she probably won't do something like this again. The only downside to his presence was.. I think she will try to convince herself I rejected her in that moment because he was there.

For people asking about my dog. He's happy and comfortable (and still alive). He eats well unlike his age. My priorities are to improve the quality of his life, not unnecessarily prolong it. But every night I check on him before I fall asleep. And every morning I wake up with this feeling of dread. He has Cushing's disease and chronic pancreatitis. He is high risk for developing cancer. The medication routine is a bit complex but I am learning everything l can for him. Take care of your pets and check them often for lumps. A lot of animals hide their pain. I guess we have that in common. Ah... maybe I shouldn't have ended the post like this.

Anyway. I'm really okay. I posted this 'update' because I got a lot of messages and it's easier than answering them separately.

In case I don't feel like answering comments, I will just leave this here:

There is a lot I haven't shared. There is a lot I haven't even admit to my self yet. I am not saying I am perfect. It's not about being right or wrong anymore. I have a lot of flaws too. I'm sure I handled some things poorly. And I know I was a fool.

I.. also still experience moments where my heart aches and I question if I‚Äôm wrong about everything, wanting to just get back together. Hopefully this will get easier with time. Anyway. Writing here counts as therapy right?

I'm going to go drink a cold beer in the shower.

You are sipping your evening coffee, scrolling through your phone, and in just a few taps, you enrol in a course from IIT or Harvard without quitting your job, without moving cities, and without breaking the bank. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, in India, this is now a reality.

The online education revolution is reshaping how working professionals learn and grow. With a workforce exceeding **600 million young professionals**, a thriving EdTech industry, and government-backed digital initiatives, India is not just adapting to the e-learning wave, it‚Äôs leading it.¬†

The country has transformed learning into a flexible, affordable, and career-enhancing experience, giving professionals the chance to upskill on their own terms. Let‚Äôs dive into how India is making this possible.

# A Market Driven by Demand

India has the world‚Äôs most prominent young workforce, with over **600 million people under 25**. This workforce is eager to stay competitive in a globalised job market, and online education is the best solution. According to a report by KPMG and Google, the **online education market in India is expected to reach $4 billion by 2025**, with a significant chunk of it coming from professional courses.

Why? Because experts understand that traditional education is insufficient on its own. Due to automation, artificial intelligence, and changing sectors, reskilling is increasingly required rather than choice. Online courses are preferred for professionals wishing to advance their skills without taking a break from their professions because they offer flexibility, affordability, and access to worldwide expertise.

# EdTech Giants Paving the Way

India is home to some of the world‚Äôs most successful EdTech companies, revolutionising learning for working professionals.

* **UpGrad** ‚Äì Founded in 2015, UpGrad has partnered with top universities like IITs, ISB and even global names like Harvard Business School Online. It specialises in MBA, data science, and technology programs tailored for professionals.
* **Simplilearn** ‚Äì Focused on digital skills, Simplilearn offers courses in AI, cybersecurity, project management, and more, with over 3 million learners globally.
* **Great Learning** ‚Äì With partnerships with Stanford and MIT, this platform offers industry-relevant analytics, AI, and business management programs.
* **Coursera and edX‚Äôs Indian Collaborations** ‚Äì With universities like IIMs, IITs, and IIITs offering programs through these platforms, professionals can now get Ivy League-quality education from their living rooms.

These platforms are not just teaching theory; they provide hands-on projects, mentorship, and networking opportunities that help professionals implement their learning in real-world scenarios.

# Affordable and Accessible Learning

The affordability of online education is one of India's most significant advantages. Indian online education platforms provide top-notch courses for a fraction of the price of Western universities, which charge thousands of dollars.

For instance, an **IIM-certified online executive MBA can cost between ‚Çπ2-5 lakh ($2,500-$6,000)**, compared to an on-campus MBA that can cost upwards of ‚Çπ25 lakh ($30,000). Similarly, a full-stack development course that costs $10,000 in the US is available in India for **‚Çπ50,000-‚Çπ1 lakh ($600-$1,200)**.

Moreover, platforms offer **EMI options, government-backed financial aid, and even employer-sponsored learning programs**, making upskilling accessible to a much larger audience.

# The Role of the Government

The Indian government has been a strong advocate of digital education. Initiatives like **SWAYAM**, **NPTEL**, and **Diksha** have made high-quality online courses available for free or at minimal costs.

* **SWAYAM** (Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) offers over 2,000 free courses from top institutions.
* **NPTEL** (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) is a joint initiative of IITs and IISc that provides free engineering, management, and science courses.
* **AICTE and UGC approvals** ‚Äì Many online degree programs are now recognised by AICTE and UGC, allowing professionals to get accredited certifications and even entire degrees online.

With these initiatives, even professionals in remote areas can access world-class education without relocating to big cities.

# Flexibility: The Game-Changer

Online education's flexibility is one of the main factors contributing to its popularity among professionals. The majority of courses allow students to study while working a full-time job since they are self-paced or offer weekend classes.

Case in point: A software engineer working 9-to-6 can take an **AI/ML certification course on weekends,** or a **finance professional can upskill in fintech through short modules after work**.

This is a game-changer because traditional full-time degrees demand a career break, which many professionals cannot afford. Online education removes that hurdle completely.

# Industry-Relevant Curriculum and Global Recognition

Another reason online education in India excels is its **focus on industry relevance**.

Unlike traditional university degrees that can quickly become outdated, online courses are **frequently updated** to meet market demands. Platforms work closely with industry experts and leading companies to design their curricula.

For instance, courses on **blockchain, AI, cloud computing, and digital marketing** have gained immense popularity as companies actively look for professionals skilled in these domains.

Moreover, many online courses come with **certifications from global universities** or collaborations with top companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, which enhances their credibility and international acceptance.

# The Future of Online Learning in India

With **5G connectivity expanding**, mobile-first learning becoming mainstream, and AI-driven personalised education rising, the future of online education in India looks brighter.

Some upcoming trends to watch:

* **Micro-credentials & nano degrees** ‚Äì Short, hyper-focused courses in specialised fields like AI ethics, climate finance, or quantum computing.
* **VR/AR-based learning** ‚Äì Imagine practising surgery or engineering simulations in a virtual lab.
* **AI-powered personal tutors** ‚Äì Customized learning experiences based on your pace and strengths.
* **Corporate tie-ups** ‚Äì More companies are integrating online learning into employee training programs.

# Final Thoughts

India is not just adapting to online education but **leading the way**. With a combination of affordability, accessibility, industry relevance, and strong government backing, India is shaping the future of online learning for working professionals worldwide. Whether you‚Äôre an engineer, marketer, finance professional, or entrepreneur, the opportunities to upskill have never been more abundant or convenient.

So, if you‚Äôre a working professional in India, the question is no longer *‚ÄúCan I upskill?‚Äù* but *‚ÄúWhich course should I start with today?‚Äù*You are sipping your evening coffee, scrolling through your phone, and in just a few taps, you enrol in a course from IIT or Harvard without quitting your job, without moving cities, and without breaking the bank. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, in India, this is now a reality.

For instance, an **IIM-certified online executive MBA can cost between ‚Çπ2-5 lakh ($2,500-$6,000)**, compared to an on-campus MBA that can cost upwards of ‚Çπ25 lakh ($30,000). Similarly, a full-stack development course that costs $10,000 in the US is available in India for **‚Çπ50,000-‚Çπ1 lakh ($600-$1,200)**.

Moreover, platforms offer **EMI options, government-backed financial aid, and even employer-sponsored learning programs**, making upskilling accessible to a much larger audience.

# The Role of the Government

The Indian government has been a strong advocate of digital education. Initiatives like **SWAYAM**, **NPTEL**, and **Diksha** have made high-quality online courses available for free or at minimal costs.

* **SWAYAM** (Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) offers over 2,000 free courses from top institutions.
* **NPTEL** (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) is a joint initiative of IITs and IISc that provides free engineering, management, and science courses.
* **AICTE and UGC approvals** ‚Äì Many online degree programs are now recognised by AICTE and UGC, allowing professionals to get accredited certifications and even entire degrees online.

With these initiatives, even professionals in remote areas can access world-class education without relocating to big cities.

# Flexibility: The Game-Changer

Online education's flexibility is one of the main factors contributing to its popularity among professionals. The majority of courses allow students to study while working a full-time job since they are self-paced or offer weekend classes.

Case in point: A software engineer working 9-to-6 can take an **AI/ML certification course on weekends,** or a **finance professional can upskill in fintech through short modules after work**.

This is a game-changer because traditional full-time degrees demand a career break, which many professionals cannot afford. Online education removes that hurdle completely.

# Industry-Relevant Curriculum and Global Recognition

Another reason online education in India excels is its **focus on industry relevance**.

Unlike traditional university degrees that can quickly become outdated, online courses are **frequently updated** to meet market demands. Platforms work closely with industry experts and leading companies to design their curricula.

For instance, courses on **blockchain, AI, cloud computing, and digital marketing** have gained immense popularity as companies actively look for professionals skilled in these domains.

Moreover, many online courses come with **certifications from global universities** or collaborations with top companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, which enhances their credibility and international acceptance.

# The Future of Online Learning in India

With **5G connectivity expanding**, mobile-first learning becoming mainstream, and AI-driven personalised education rising, the future of online education in India looks brighter.

Some upcoming trends to watch:

* **Micro-credentials & nano degrees** ‚Äì Short, hyper-focused courses in specialised fields like AI ethics, climate finance, or quantum computing.
* **VR/AR-based learning** ‚Äì Imagine practising surgery or engineering simulations in a virtual lab.
* **AI-powered personal tutors** ‚Äì Customized learning experiences based on your pace and strengths.
* **Corporate tie-ups** ‚Äì More companies are integrating online learning into employee training programs.

# Final Thoughts

India is not just adapting to online education but **leading the way**. With a combination of affordability, accessibility, industry relevance, and strong government backing, India is shaping the future of online learning for working professionals worldwide. Whether you‚Äôre an engineer, marketer, finance professional, or entrepreneur, the opportunities to upskill have never been more abundant or convenient.",1,1738558012.0,Educationaltopic,0,1.0,False

1igh74z,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1igh74z/the_types_of_extendedprolonged_fasting_explained/,The types of extended/prolonged fasting explained,"NOTE: If you have the question, ""Will this break my fast?"", keep reading...

Water fasting is technically a strict fast without any other food or beverages besides water. You can argue electrolytes should be included in this because water has trace minerals as well; however, the amounts are significantly lower. In addition, most electrolyte mixes have some sort of extras such as flavoring or other vitamins. That said, water fasting is often used interchangeably with a zero calorie fast.

Zero calorie fasting is what most people are really doing. Most commonly people are drinking ""zero calorie drinks"" like coffee, tea, and artificially sweetened beverages. That said, pretty much everything has at least a couple calories. It's just labeling regulations allows anything with less than 5 calories to be labeled as 0. As long as you're not chugging a whole bunch at once, the body isn't going to have a biochemical response to the amount - even saliva contains a minute amount of calories. In other words, it's still negligible calories.

Dirty fasting is consuming foods or beverages with a small amount of calories. There's no real standards on limits, but anything over 200 calories per day is absolutely not fasting. The body will definitely have a biochemical reaction (although small) to that amount. Consuming 50 to 100 calories doesn't mean you're going to lose out on all the benefits. Both insulin and autophagy are functions of caloric restriction and not fasting alone. The impact will be minor, and some people need this for sustainability producing better overall results. Additionally, taking in small amounts of protein, glucose, or nutrients can actually be beneficial. Do what works for you.

There is no such thing as a protein sparing fast, juice fast, or whatever - those are diets. Significant caloric intake will absolutely still impact insulin and autophagy in ways that are much less effective than fasting. That isn't to say these diets do or don't have benefits over more popular traditional diets, but it's not fasting.

As a final note, these are definitions, but don't get wrapped around the wheel with them. If someone gives you grief for not really fasting because you had your coffee with creamer, just acknowledge it is a dirty fast and move on. If someone clarifies they did a true water only fast, don't argue you can have other drinks on a ""water only"" fast. Just move on and get results.",9,1738557952.0,fasting,7,0.85,False

1igh3s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mixedrace/comments/1igh3s1/my_boyfriends_friend_made_a_racist_joke_at_a/,"My boyfriend‚Äôs friend made a racist joke at a party. Everyone was white, except me.","TLDR; My (31F) boyfriend‚Äôs (31M) friend (38M) made a racist joke at a 1950s era murder mystery party he was hosting. He and his wife (38F) have been actively trying to make plans to hang out with us again, but I don‚Äôt really want to.

Context:
We were all sitting around a dinner table. Drinks were flowing and we were all more-or-less ‚Äúin character.‚Äù It was a 1950s era murder mystery party. I was saying something and the man next to me was speaking over me, interrupting me; he was quite drunk. The host of the party, my boyfriend‚Äôs friend, said to the drunk guy: ‚Äúshut up or I‚Äôll shoot you like you‚Äôre a black man.‚Äù People at the table laughed and I was completely shocked, dumbfounded. 

I‚Äôm mixed raced. I was raised by my black mom. People often assume I‚Äôm just white. Everyone else at that dinner table that night was white. This guy has met my mom numerous times because they used to be neighbors. 

I pulled my boyfriend aside and told him how upsetting that comment was. A week later, my boyfriend met this guy for coffee and confronted him about it. The guy brushed it off. He hardly apologized. He said he was drunk and didn‚Äôt remember it. 

I‚Äôve had another friend tell me that maybe he was just trying to ‚Äúbe in character‚Äù for the 1950s era but I think that‚Äôs such a week argument, and I was annoyed at my (white) friend for making it seem like THAT would somehow, maybe, make it OK. 

It‚Äôs been almost a month since this incident and I haven‚Äôt seen this guy or his wife since then. He knows the comment upset me and he hasn‚Äôt reached out to apologize or talk about it.

I‚Äôve known this guy and his wife for 5 years. I went to their wedding and my boyfriend was a groomsman. They live down the street from us and they‚Äôve been trying to make plans to see us, but I don‚Äôt think I want to be friends with this guy anymore.

My boyfriend says that I shouldn‚Äôt avoid the guy if I want an apology. But I also don‚Äôt want to force myself into a social situation just to pander to an apology, especially since he wasn‚Äôt particularly apologetic when my boyfriend spoke to him.

I haven‚Äôt really been in a situation like this before, not with anyone close to me. I‚Äôve been avoiding the couple but I don‚Äôt think I can avoid them for much longer.

Is this an opportunity to educate this man? Is that what I should do? Should my boyfriend pick up more of the slack? Would it be unreasonable to expect my boyfriend to stop hanging out with this guy? Should I just ghost these friends?",18,1738557630.0,mixedrace,10,0.95,False

1iggxm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allaboutamazonads/comments/1iggxm7/how_to_improve_brand_store_engagement_on_amazon/,How to improve brand store engagement on amazon?,"I wanted to share some tips that can help you create a seamless and engaging shopping experience for your customers. 

**1. Build a Clear Navigation Structure**

Think of your Storefront as a map‚Äîit should guide customers effortlessly to what they‚Äôre looking for. A well-organized navigation system is key to keeping shoppers engaged and reducing bounce rates.

 *Create Intuitive Category Pages*: Group products into logical categories based on how customers shop. For example, if you‚Äôre a skincare brand, you might have categories like ‚ÄúCleansers,‚Äù ‚ÄúMoisturizers,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSerums.‚Äù 

Pro tip: Include bestseller ASINs on each category page‚ÄîASIN-specific widgets tend to perform better.

 *Add Subcategories for Better Organization*: If your product range is broad, break it down further. For instance, an electronics brand could split ‚ÄúAccessories‚Äù into ‚ÄúCables,‚Äù ‚ÄúChargers,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeadphones.‚Äù

**2. Use Engaging Visual Content**

First impressions matter, and visuals are the first thing customers notice. High-quality, engaging visuals can build trust and keep customers exploring your Storefront longer.

 *Unique Header Images for Every Page*: Customize header images to reflect the theme of each page. For example, a ‚ÄúSummer Collection‚Äù page could feature vibrant lifestyle shots of your products in use.

 *Lifestyle Imagery*: Show your products in real-life scenarios. If you sell home decor, display a styled living room with your cushions, rugs, and wall art. This helps customers visualize how your products fit into their lives.

 *Follow Amazon‚Äôs Visual Guidelines*: Make sure your visuals meet Amazon‚Äôs official specifications for optimal performance.

**3. Prioritize Strategic Merchandising**

Your Storefront is a prime spot to highlight the products you want to push‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs new arrivals, seasonal items, or bestsellers.

 *Feature Key Products on the Homepage*: Showcase your top-performing items or promotions front and center. For example, create sections like ‚ÄúBestsellers‚Äù or ‚ÄúTop-Rated‚Äù to grab attention immediately.

 *Highlight Seasonal and Promotional Deals*: Create dedicated pages for events like Black Friday or holiday sales. Make sure these pages are visually appealing and easy to find via your navigation menu or homepage banners.

 *Create Use Case Pages*: Think about how customers use your products and build pages around those scenarios. For example, a kitchen appliance brand could have pages like ‚ÄúMeal Prep Essentials‚Äù or ‚ÄúHoliday Baking Tools.‚Äù

**4. Organize ASINs Effectively**

How you present your product listings can make or break the customer experience. Thoughtful organization helps customers discover and evaluate your products with ease.

 *Group Variations Together*: Display all variations of a product (like colors or sizes) in one section. This makes it easier for customers to compare options without jumping between pages.

 *Use Product Grids for Bulk Listings*: If you have a large inventory, a grid layout can showcase multiple ASINs efficiently. Bonus: Product grids can automatically hide out-of-stock items and prioritize top-selling or high-margin products.

 *Highlight Key Product Details*: Use product tiles to display star ratings, reviews, price, and the ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù button. This simplifies the shopping process and encourages direct purchases

**5. Add Interactive Features**

Interactive elements can make your Storefront more engaging and informative, helping customers make better purchasing decisions.

 *Shoppable Images*: Use images where customers can click on specific items to explore them further. For example, a living room setup could have clickable links to the sofa, coffee table, and decor items. (Pro tip: A single shoppable image can link up to 6 ASINs.)

 *Background Videos*: Replace static banners with short, looping videos that showcase your products in action. For example, a fashion brand could use a video of models wearing their latest collection.

 *Infographics for Complex Info*: Simplify detailed product features or comparisons with visually engaging infographics. For instance, a tech brand could create an infographic comparing the specs of two laptops.

**6. Maintain Brand Consistency**

A cohesive look and feel across your Storefront builds trust and reinforces your brand identity. Consistency in colors, fonts, and messaging ensures customers recognize your brand at every touchpoint

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Back in 2021 I published a book that did pretty well and to date has over 3,000 reviews and ratings. My primary audience is in the UK, where I originally built an audience through a traditional publisher before moving to self-publishing. I've self-published other books, but this particular one was the most successful by far.

One thing I've learned from self-publishing is that I should have listened more, and earlier, to advice I read here on Reddit about self-publishing. I've written other books that got great reviews, but didn't sell nearly as well as the one with 3,000 ratings because they weren't bang on the mark so far as genre and audience are concerned. As a result, I wrote a more recent, unrelated book with audience expectations in mind, and that's also performing well, with 1500 plus reviews and ratings. 

Most of my self-published books are exclusive to Amazon, and in Kindle Unlimited, since that's where the overwhelming majority of my readers are. 

I prefer writing standalones, but I've read a lot of advice that the market much prefers series or trilogies. Having finally smelled the coffee, I'm most of the way through the first drafts of two sequels to the book with 3,000 ratings/reviews.

Once the books are finished and edited, I'm planning on releasing book two in, perhaps, August, and book three in October. However, I read a comment recently that such rapid release strategies aren't so popular anymore, and wanted to check with the self-publishing hive mind and also to see if there's any other wisdom some of might be able to impart. I'm not sure if 'rapid release' even necessarily applies to two sequels to a book that's already more than three years old (but still gets offers of Kindle deals from time to time).

Additional query: I've never run Facebook ads, mainly because I can't, for geographical reasons (don't ask, it's complicated). Does anyone happen to know if any of the lower-end Facebook ad services advertised on Fiverr are at all reliable or worth the money?",2,1738556930.0,selfpublish,6,1.0,False

Chapter 1

The devils in the details



I didn‚Äôt know what I got into when the story came across my desk, I was just excited to finally be given a chance to cover something major. I had no clue how big this story truly was, at the time I thought it was just a small article over the recent death of Charles Smith the local bookstore owner. Rizepoint is a small town after all so to have a murder happen here became a major thing, details from the report itself was making everyone uneasy. Charles was found in the shop in the early morning. His body laid in an odd position almost looking like he fought his attacker, only blood soaked the walls and floor‚Ä¶the worst of it was his heart was ripped from his chest. I admit I was puzzled as to what person could do something so evil, Charles had a wife and a child who wasn‚Äôt even a year old yet. I knew in my heart something was off about all of this, only I wished I knew what I did now. There is a certain darkness that hides within rizepoint, a legend of old and her name is mercy evans. For some they said she and her family were just farmers, but for others they believed the evans to be witches. Of course when you're a rookie reporter like myself you tend to believe what you can reason with, I never truly believed in ghosts and the world of the darkness. The legend begins on october 31, 1692 back then rizepoint was just a small settlement, in those days most settlements were close knit families who trusted each other. Among this small town judge William Vondrake ruled with an iron fist, along with his council who was alway there to help make sure no one crossed the code. The villagers would fear and respect the judge and the council, only trying to stay out of their eye‚Äôs view.¬†



However the evans lived a few miles from the settlement, which served them well as the farm was a good source of food and raising livestock. They were said to be a quiet family, only traveling to the village to drop off food for the winter seasons. Now I can‚Äôt say I know the whole truth behind this legend but I do know that on all hallows eve the judge has stormed onto the evan‚Äôs farm, burning their crops and killing their livestock‚Ä¶word has gotten around that the evans were witches practicing black magic in the night. He hung the family from their great oak tree on the top of the hill overlooking the blazing flames, mercy before her death vowed to come back and placed a curse on all bloodlines of the judge and the council. How this legend fits was a mystery to me, the old timers swore that mercy had killed charles‚Ä¶ but of course that would point back to her curse suggesting that he was within the bloodline of either the judge or one of the council members. ‚Äú I need more time sir, this story is proving to be a bigger deal than I expected.‚Äù My boss only sat back in his chair looking over my notes and reports I had gathered. Vincent had been working in this business for so long that we knew to respect his wishes‚Ä¶so you could understand my fears about asking for more time. *‚Äú So you expect to write a piece from a old legend and some reports that the police would allow you to know?‚Äù ‚Äú No sir, I want to really dig deep and make sure that this story will change this newspaper forever. I know it‚Äôs a small town but how often do we get the chance to cover a story like this?‚Äù* he seemed to think about my words all the while I shook waiting for his answer, *‚Äúwhat exactly are you planning ms. val, I don‚Äôt need any trouble now‚Ä¶but you have me interested.‚Äù ‚Äú No trouble I promise sir, I just want to give everyone a peace of mind about the murder and maybe help Charles's wife in the process‚Ä¶.‚Äù* he stood now looking out the window, his hands resting behind his back, *‚Äú you know I lived in rizepoint my whole life, when I took over this business from my father I promised him one thing‚Ä¶that I would honor the people that live here.‚Äù ‚Äú I mean no harm sir. I want to do what is best for this town, and that is finding the truth and bringing this killer to justice.‚Äù* I was in disbelief of my own words, what brought to a hero‚Äôs state of mind? I watched as he turn a gentle smile on his face, *‚Äú you know I knew there was something about you I liked‚Ä¶..ok I will give more time but you have to show a mock up in the next two weeks.‚Äù* I shook his hand before heading back to my desk, there was an odd sense of excitement knowing I could really do something great with this piece.



Pulling all information before me I almost felt lost, just a few police reports that barely told me enough and some printed papers about the legend of mercy Evans and her family. *‚ÄúThere got to be something more I could use for this story‚Ä¶. Come on liz you‚Äôre better than this ... .where is that hero who got her permission?‚Äù* I had looked through every website and book only finding the same things I already knew, Mercy and her family didn‚Äôt seem like the type to do something like witchcraft. By late afternoon I had gotten nowhere, *‚Äúcome on there gotta be something i'm missing here‚Ä¶. Maybe a break for lunch?‚Äù* I stood as a loud growl filled my stomach, how I had forgotten to eat wasn‚Äôt like me at all. Heading out into the street the noise seemed to echo around me, for a small town everyone seemed to fill the sidewalks‚Ä¶. Since Charles's death this was becoming a normal scene. I kept my head down only thinking back to the story, my boss had granted me a chance and I needed to show him the best I could. Rizepoint was certainly alive today, and for one reason people would gather around the bookshop placing crosses and flowers. *‚ÄúWhat a shame Charles was a kind soul, he alway there when you needed him‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú I only wish that Cassie is staying strong‚Ä¶if not for herself then for the baby.‚Äù* I only listened to the crowd for a few minutes, all of them recalling stories of how Charles was in life. I never truly got to know him like most but I do remember his kindness when I would come to his shop. Again my stomach growls, reminding me of why I was out here, *‚Äú alright I hear you‚Ä¶.‚Äù* Betty's diner was the local stop for some great food, in fact most of the waiters would know me by name‚Ä¶as I visited there so often. *‚Äú Liz, I was wondering if you got sick or something? here I saved your table for you ....‚Äù* maggie was a sweet soul she had been working with her mother since last fall, betty was overjoyed the day she came home. I smiled as she led me across the far side of the diner. I loved the far corner best, due to having some quiet time to myself. *‚Äú No, I just got caught up in a new story I'm working on. I almost forgot to even eat‚Ä¶ that sounds foolish of me uh?* She only laughed before taking my order, *‚Äú mom is right your head is alway in the clouds‚Ä¶ you know there is more to life than your job.‚Äù ‚Äú I know but this is a major story Maggie, one that could change my career‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†



She only just shook her head grabbing my shoulder, *‚Äúwell I'm glad that you finally got your break‚Ä¶just don‚Äôt go killing yourself over this‚Ä¶‚Äù* I knew what she meant. I had done insane things over my time working at the newspaper, I had even made myself sick once just pushing myself too hard. *‚Äú ok you got a point‚Ä¶but don‚Äôt expect me to go easy on this one, shame I don‚Äôt have enough information on it‚Ä¶‚Äù* she only smiled telling me to wait a minute before disappearing to the front. I sat back playing with my fork and spoon, thinking about how I was going to put an acceptable story on my bosses desk. *‚ÄúSo what are you covering this time? Let me guess‚Ä¶ the top 5 best local shops in rizepoint?‚Äù ‚Äúno‚Ä¶ I have moved up from those stories‚Ä¶ I'm covering Charles Smith's murder.‚Äù* she froze, almost foolish of her answer, *‚Äú well shit‚Ä¶ now I feel like an asshole‚Ä¶‚Äù* Maggie only seemed to look down at the floor, *‚Äú don‚Äôt you think that Vincent wanted to address the murder, but I don‚Äôt think he meant for it to be as deep as it‚Äôs getting.‚Äù* she seemed confused by my words, as I looked around the diner knowing maybe it wasn‚Äôt best to talk about it here. *‚Äú Look, just come over to dinner tonight, and I will tell you all I know so far‚Ä¶ but you got to stay quiet about everything I tell you.‚Äù*¬†



Maggie‚Äôs eyes lit up as she quickly jumped out of her chair, *‚Äú Perfect, that sounds like a plan, see you around 6:00 pm then?‚Äù* I agreed as she returned to work, Maggie had a way about helping me sometimes. I spent the rest of the day back in my office. There was something odd about the report; truly a simple document with only bare details but something seemed to catch my eye. Charles had been reported missing by his wife after he didn‚Äôt come home in the evening, the only thing they didn‚Äôt write was who found him‚Ä¶ his wife maybe either way I had to find out the full story. *‚ÄúStill working on that story huh‚Ä¶.‚Äù* Vincent stood in my doorway, his smile only greeting me, *‚Äú yeah just looking over the report I was given‚Ä¶seems like a lot of details are missing. But I kind of figured they wouldn‚Äôt give a reporter the full details anyhow‚Ä¶ shame cause I could have helped them.‚Äù* he only sat down across from me, looking over the report‚Ä¶ *‚Äúthe life of a reporter, you only trusted so much with the facts‚Ä¶. My father alway told me if you want to find out the truth‚Ä¶ then you must go look for it yourself. Either way, sometimes going to the source of the matter will change things‚Ä¶.‚Äù* I didn‚Äôt understand at first as he stood looking out my window, but the more I got to thinking it all became clear. *‚Äú his wife‚Ä¶. They talked about her in the report‚Ä¶. I should go talk to her then‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú Well now you're getting it, just be respectful of her wishes ok‚Ä¶she's been through a lot already.‚Äù* he didn‚Äôt say another word as he waved goodnite, heading out into the night air I could only think about how to even start a conversation with her. All the way home I worried about this, I know a foolish thing to let fear make you second guess yourself‚Ä¶but she could possibly fill in the holes of what happened that horrible night. Preparing dinner seemed to calm my mind, knowing Maggie could help with ideas for the story itself‚Ä¶ I have known her since we were kids. By 6:00 my doorbell echoed throughout the house, *‚Äú hey liz‚Ä¶.‚Äù* she entered holding a folder under her arm, I was puzzled before she just gave me a grin.¬†



*‚Äú So detective, what did you find this time‚Ä¶‚Äù* following me into the kitchen she sat down pushing the file toward me, *‚Äú don‚Äôt open it yet‚Ä¶. I want to know what you have already written down‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú not much just the local legend of mercy evans and well a very simple police report‚Ä¶ but it doesn‚Äôt really help me at all‚Ä¶‚Äù* picking up my notebook she started through my notes and the report, *‚Äú they are either lazy and didn‚Äôt want you to know anything about the murder‚Ä¶. I'm choosing the second. Mostly due to you being a reporter and the police aren‚Äôt really trusting of anyone who wants to speak the truth.""* She wasn‚Äôt wrong, the police had alway shown distaste when one of us had come into the station, even Vincent would get hardly anything out of them.¬†

*‚ÄúWell I know how to get the full story‚Ä¶ well maybe‚Ä¶ I'm planning on talking to his wife. If she would even talk to me at all.""* Maggie seemed to think about my words, before her eyes lit up‚Ä¶ *‚Äú wait, maybe if you tell her side of the story, I mean the police are leaving stuff out‚Ä¶ look at the report they gave you‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú well that is not the full report‚Ä¶ they seemed unsure to even share that with me‚Ä¶.‚Äù* she only rolled her eyes, that was the truth about maggie‚Ä¶ She never trusted the police in the town. In fact her mother shares the same feeling with her, a few years ago her father got into a car crash leaving them both on their own. A driver hit him head on, leaving the scene‚Ä¶ police promised they would do everything to find the one who had hit him. Only after a few short weeks with nothing but the same answers, Maggie and her mother were left in the dark knowing they would never know peace again. *‚ÄúEither way all I have to go off of what I see‚Ä¶ well tomorrow I will go visit his wife hoping to have a good turn out.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell then this should help you, I kind of did some research for you‚Ä¶.‚Äù* opening the file I notice only three things written on the page, a name, phone number and address. *‚ÄúWho is Lady rose? Wait‚Ä¶. This isn‚Äôt who I think it is?‚Äù* she nodded only excited¬† i knew the name, *‚Äú yes it‚Äôs‚Ä¶. Before you say anything just hear me out. She is the best person to ask about mercy evans‚Ä¶¬† forget what people said about her, liz you wanted to find out the truth and she can give it to you.""* Lady Rose was the old crazy woman, all small towns have them‚Ä¶. But she and her daughter Lily live out in the country away from town. Mainly due to how the town treated her family, *‚ÄúI promised my boss to stay out of trouble‚Ä¶. What do you think he would say if he knew I was talking to her‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, what your boss doesn‚Äôt know can‚Äôt hurt him‚Ä¶ look I will go with you even‚Ä¶ just give her a chance.‚Äù* ¬†



She waited as I looked at the paper before me. I did admit I was confused about the legend. Maybe talking to Rose would clear up any lies about the evans. *‚Äú fine but you let me do all the talking‚Ä¶.‚Äù* she jumped from her chair almost knocking her plate to the floor, *‚Äú prefect we can go talk to his wife and lady rose tomorrow, I'm going to grab my stuff‚Ä¶..* I looked confused as she ran out the door, returning only with a suitcase in hands. *‚Äú Are you staying the night?‚Äù ‚Äú of course it would be easier than picking me up in the morning‚Ä¶‚Äù* I only smiled, Maggie had me wrapped around her finger, *‚Äú ok deal‚Ä¶.‚Äù* ¬†rushing up the stairs I watched her disappear into my room, before calling after me. All through the night I couldn‚Äôt sleep. My mind was too active thinking about tomorrow,¬† first go talk to ms. Smith about her side of things‚Ä¶ only I feared she may turn me away. This little town had turned everything about the murder upside down, police barely even doing anything but watching the crime scene‚Ä¶. And now whispers of Charles and his family. I could only imagine what she was going through, taking care of the baby by herself‚Ä¶ Either way I wanted to help her. Of course not forgetting to talk to lady rose, the legend seemed to play a huge role in all of this, but how could a dead family cause this horrible thing to happen? *‚Äú Still awake as alway‚Ä¶. What‚Äôs on your mind?‚Äù* I stopped seeing maggie rubbing her eyes, I forgot how much of a light sleeper she was‚Ä¶ *‚Äú I'm sorry did I wake you?‚Äù ‚Äú no I got up for a drink, and saw you out here‚Ä¶ you still haven‚Äôt answered my question?‚Äù* I pulled myself away from my work before getting Maggie my full attention, *‚Äú I feel like something isn‚Äôt right about the whole thing, why the police are hiding some details‚Ä¶. And how the town is starting to whisper about Charles's family? I know the basic truth of all of this and yet I feel like what happened to Charles was‚Ä¶.. forget it‚Ä¶‚Äù* ¬†she only sat down next to me before grabbing my hand, *‚Äú no you're going to tell me‚Ä¶ I know how this will make your mind go insane, so let me have it yell and scream if you have to.‚Äù* I smiled. Maggie was a wonderful friend, more like a sister I had either I knew she was right‚Ä¶ I do tend to let my mind get weighed down with worry. *‚ÄúI started to doubt that the legend is showing the truth of the Evans family, I mean she was only 16 right? So how could anyone think that her and the rest of the family are something to fear? ‚Äú Well you're not wrong, do you know how many different versions of that story are told? But I'm still confused as to why this legend is so important to a murder that happened here?‚Äù ‚Äú the legend‚Ä¶ It states that before mercy died she placed a curse on the judge and the council. She would come back as a spirit and take all the bloodline that still walked the earth, so just hear me out‚Ä¶. Charles died while he was alone in that bookstore. Maybe just maybe he was in the family tree of either the judge or one of the council, that is why I want to really talk to cassie.‚Äù* I knew that look she gave one that meant she was unsure of my sanity, *‚Äú you think the spirit of mercy evans killed charles? Liz‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt start the conversation like that, look i'm a believer in a lot of things‚Ä¶but ghosts coming back from the dead to get revenge?‚Äù* she meant well so I couldn‚Äôt get upset by her words, a little hurt but not enough to take her seriously‚Ä¶ *‚Äúwell maybe lady rose will be able to clear up anything about the legend, I need to get some sleep‚Ä¶ see you in the morning?‚Äù* she nodded as I headed upstairs, *‚Äúhey sleepy head you missed the alarm, funny how you couldn‚Äôt hear it‚Ä¶‚Äù* slamming my fist down onto the black box I groaned, *‚Äú I could hear it just kept hitting the snooze button, well your ready to go‚Ä¶‚Äù* maggie was dressed and ready her hair pulled back in her normal ponytail, *‚Äú yep I got up when we planned, anyway I will you get ready‚Ä¶ come downstairs when you're ready.‚Äù*¬†



Hopping into the shower I let the steam of hot rivers flow down my body, just something about the shower seemed to calm me. Getting dressed I pulled my hair back into a bun, before hearing maggie‚Äôs voice singing to the radio in the kitchen. *‚ÄúAlright pop star let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶.‚Äù* she only stopped laughing before turning the radio off, *‚Äú so where to first?‚Äù ‚Äúwell cassie cause I need to know what the hell happened that night, and she needs peace‚Ä¶ then we will talk to lady rose.‚Äù*

The drive into town was quiet, only the radio played, Maggie seemed to look out the window lost in her own little world. *‚Äú Are you ok? You're quiet‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚Äú yeah just was thinking maybe I should stay in the car, cassie may not want to talk if two of us show up. I mean I'm no reporter but she didn‚Äôt need so many people in her home.‚Äù* I agreed knowing all she's been through, *‚Äú ok well I don‚Äôt how long I may be in there, but I guess you can listen to the radio‚Ä¶‚Äù* cassie‚Äôs home was further into town, she and charles lived only a few minutes from townsquare. *‚Äú So what are you going to do if she isn‚Äôt up to talking to you at all?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell I guess it's back to the drawing board, and another visit to the police for a better report‚Ä¶ but I'm hoping she will talk to me.‚Äù* We pulled up to the drive of an old style brick home. Cassie and Charles had purchased this place a year before she found out about the baby. I was nervous this is the first time I had ever tried to do something like this, *‚Äú ok wish me luck‚Ä¶. See you hopefully in an hour‚Ä¶‚Äù* maggie only smiled as I opened the car door, I felt cold sweat running down my face. Reaching up for the bell I almost jumped as the doorbell echoed in my ears, I waited only for a few minutes before a woman in her 30‚Äôs with dark red hair opened the door, *‚Äú can I help you?* I swallow my fear as I speak , almost forgetting to open my mouth. *‚Äú Hello my name is Liz val and I'm with the rize‚Ä¶‚Äù* she seemed to stop me before I could finish, *‚Äú no I'm sorry please leave me alone‚Ä¶.* ¬†*‚ÄúWait ms. Smith, I am aware that you possibly have been through many visits from the police, people in the town trying to offer their help and I'm not here to ask you to recount what you have already said many times. I want to write a piece for the paper telling your side of this, forget what the police had said on tv or the whisper you‚Äôre hearing from the town‚Ä¶ I want to make your voice heard in all of this.‚Äù*¬†



She stopped pulling the door open again, tears rolling down her face, *‚Äúyou know I have been talking to almost everyone since my charles‚Äôs passed and yet I just wanted peace from it all‚Ä¶liz was it? You really want to help me and make sure that what I want to say is heard?‚Äù* I smiled, feeling her pain and fear, *‚Äú I just want to make sure you are heard, I want to know what happened through your eyes‚Ä¶ your words will be what they read. I promise on my life ms. Smith that I will only write this story in your and Charles's honor, I understand if you don‚Äôt want to do this.‚Äù* she opened the door moving to the side before inviting me in. Her house was beautiful as she led into the living room‚Ä¶pictures of her and Charles filled the fireplace. *‚Äú What a lovely home you have ms. smith.‚Äù she gave a weak smile as I sat down watching her walk into the kitchen, she looked tired and unrested‚Ä¶ I figured between her child, Charles's passing and just everything else she wasn‚Äôt getting much sleep. ‚Äú I hope coffee is ok. It's all I have to drink right now, just busy‚Ä¶. So liz you've been working with the paper for a long time? ‚Äú well I have been with them for about almost a year, this was my first big story to report on‚Ä¶but like I said I don‚Äôt want this to be like any other story.‚Äù* she seemed to take her time to think before picking up her cup, *‚Äú i'm glad to hear that liz cause I don‚Äôt know how much more of being left in the dark I can take, the police have been annoying and not very helpful‚Ä¶ I called them two days ago asking if they had any leads.‚Äù* I shook my head. I knew what that meant they possibly told her they were just still looking and they would call her the moment they found something. *‚Äú they didn‚Äôt have an answer, did they? I won‚Äôt lie the report they gave them was rushed like they were leaving out details. So what exactly happened up to the point of your husband‚Äôs death?‚Äù* she almost looked shocked that I knew the answer to that call, grabbing a pillow she held it against her chest almost lost for words.¬†



*‚ÄúWell my husband was acting strange before all of this, we just gave birth to Thomas so I was busy making sure he got what needed. Charles didn‚Äôt want me to worry about bills or anything but the baby, so he started to work longer hours to help us afford everything‚Ä¶ At first I was sure it was stress that was making him act in an odd way.‚Äù*¬† I was puzzled by her words. Charles was maybe just stressed about everything or was it more than he was saiding? *‚Äú What do you mean in an odd way?‚Äù* she only got up moving toward the pictures on the fireplace, before picking up one and heading back to the couch. *‚Äú Charles alway smiles no matter how hard things get. That smile never left his face, he was showing fear and dread like something was wrong‚Ä¶ I asked him many times but he just assured me that everything was ok. He would have these moments you know‚Ä¶ where he stared off into space, almost wide eyes and stiff like he couldn‚Äôt move.‚Äù*¬† She explained that Charles was plagued by nightmares as we spent the hour talking, *‚Äú¬† Strange truly but this figure, did he ever say what it looked like?‚Äù ‚Äú No he couldn‚Äôt see but he did say it was like a shadow with glowing eyes, covered in smoke or flames.‚Äù* I looked at my notes recalling everything she had told in the hour I had been here, only one thing seemed to bug me. *‚Äú¬† Who found your husband? I hate to ask but the police didn‚Äôt say anything about it at all.‚Äù* she froze as her face had gone pale, I felt bad for even asking but she only gave me that weak smile‚Ä¶. *‚Äú I did‚Ä¶ I was worried when he didn‚Äôt come home so I drove to the bookstore. I was just glad that Thomas was staying with a good friend.‚Äù* I closed the notebook thanking her for allowing me to hear her side of the story, she only hugged me before stopping me again. *‚Äú I don‚Äôt want to sound crazy but I fear that the killer is‚Ä¶.. Mercy‚Ä¶ I know bullshit right‚Ä¶‚Äù* I only grabbed her hand and smiled again letting her tears fall down her cheek, *‚Äúthat's not crazy cassie it‚Äôs something that I believe may be tied into all of this, I just didn‚Äôt want to say anything at first.‚Äù*¬†



Walking back toward my car I waved goodbye, this legend was starting to become a huge part of this‚Ä¶ still i didn‚Äôt understand how? *‚Äú I was starting to wonder but I see you got some information, was she ok? I hate to see anyone suffer‚Ä¶‚Äù* I placed my bag onto the backseat, and Maggie looked worried as I started the car. *‚ÄúWell at first she didn‚Äôt want to talk, but I let her know I was there to tell her story‚Ä¶so well I got her to tell everything about charles. Still I feel bad she found her own husband that day‚Ä¶.‚Äù* Maggie's face went pale, almost unable to accept what she heard, the drive was quiet again as both me and her didn‚Äôt know how to react to any of this. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

I've been unemployed just shy of a year due to FND (tldr, my stress threshold is nearly zero and stress makes me have seizure-like episodes). I randomly get HR spikes to 150 during the day while sitting still. 

I need to move, I need to exercise, I need to eat better, but I rarely have the energy to do any of those things. The only reason I haven't gained a ton of weight is because I'm on concerta (aka speed). 

I need to lose about 15lbs to improve knee pain and to fit back into my clothes (not having a job means no money to replace my entire wardrobe) but I'm lost. 

Diet:
I only really drink water
I very very rarely eat delivery/takeout/fast food
I've got a big sweet tooth but try to limit intake
Usual breakfast is coffee with monkfruit and splash of milk and maybe oatmeal (old fashioned. I tried to like steel cut, I'm getting there) 
Lunch is usually left overs or a handful of trail mix
Dinner is usually a protein (pork loin or chips, chicken, venison, or salmon), a starch (sweet potato, goodles, brown rice, quinoa) and veg (salad, frozen veg, roasted veg, generally green beans, broccoli, peas, asparagus, kale, etc) 

I'm trying to walk when I have the energy, okay with my kid, stand more than sit, but I also eff myself if I do that too much because I'm then useless for hours after. 

I'm staying at 1300kcal per day, my bmr is 1500. I have not moved an inch on the scale or measurements in six weeks.

Come over me, I had wrong Maggie by looking into her mind‚Ä¶ of course I didn‚Äôt know what I would find. *‚Äú I can‚Äôt do this‚Ä¶. Betty wouldn‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶she would think I was sick or something.‚Äù* Placing my phone down onto the table, hot tears seemed to run down my face, all this fear and yet I knew there was no time for this‚Ä¶ I had to fight in order to save everyone from this horrible fate that befell the town. My mind wondered back to my ties with the evans, was there really a truth to that‚Ä¶ *‚Äú look into your mother‚Äôs past liz, we can find out about robin later‚Ä¶.‚Äù* ¬†Sitting back at the table I let my mind focus on the piece of writing down all I knew so far, only for a few hours anyway before all I could think about again was my mother. Even my dreams that night seemed to keep me focused on her, finally giving in I knew where to start‚Ä¶ in the mid morning I gathered my stuff and got into my car. Picking up my phone, I called my work. I was confused when I was told that Vincent was still out due to sickness‚Ä¶*‚Äù well¬† could you tell him that I will be out of town for the weekend, I am going to see my family‚Ä¶""* Mary only agreed as she hung up leaving to focus back on the road. I had been living with Paul and Lucy most my life‚Ä¶ in fact the night I had been told I was officially a part of the family was the best memory I had.¬† Of course they moved out of rizepoint a few years back, and Paul was ready for a quiet life out in the country‚Ä¶ which I admit made me laugh remembering Lucy's disagreement about the subject. But paul alway had a way of changing her mind, the last we spoke she was enjoying the large open space and many walks she takes through the woods.¬†



My mind seemed to play back all the old memories from when I was a kid, the only part about those I hated was my school years‚Ä¶ being bullied and told I was just a lost child without real parents to love me. I nearly lost track of time as I noticed the clock was 5*:30 pm had I really been on the road that long? I need to rest‚Ä¶.‚Äù* There was truth in that moment knowing I could barely keep my eyes open, pulling over. I pulled my phone out and typed in local hotels near me‚Ä¶ of course being so far out meant I would be driving even longer to get to one. *‚ÄúMaybe just a small nap‚Ä¶ of course that would be stupid you're in the middle of nowhere‚Ä¶.‚Äù* knowing my foster parents would not forgive me for doing such a foolish thing, pulling back onto the road I focused on the music letting it keep awake. The four hours were also murder on my mind, before I noticed my parent‚Äôs home in the distance‚Ä¶ it was almost 12:00 am I wondered if they were even still awake? Grabbing my stuff I started up the long drive only pausing to see the same old station wagon, *‚Äú still living are you? Well I'm glad to see you either way‚Ä¶.* I remember so many good trips in that car. Getting near the house I worried as no lights seemed to be on, only the glow from a warm fireplace in the living room. It felt odd to be here again after all we hadn‚Äôt seen each other in over 3 years, *‚Äúcome on liz what are you so fearful of‚Ä¶. Just knock on the door.‚Äù* reaching my hand up to door I almost jumped back as a pair of glowing yellow eyes looked back at me, backing away from the door I almost screamed. *‚ÄúCharlie? Is that really you‚Ä¶.‚Äù* the old black lab stepped forward as the metal chain dragged the ground, bending down I almost smiled as his thick wet kisses covered my face. *‚ÄúCharlie you ready to come in‚Ä¶.Liz! Wow I didn‚Äôt hear you coming up the drive‚Ä¶ lucy! We have a visitor!‚Äù* ¬†I watched as he seemed to almost dance in place, laughing only for a moment before my mother had called from the top of the stairs. *‚Äú oh liz come on in you look tired and hungry, please say you're staying over the weekend?‚Äù ‚Äú don‚Äôt worry mom I was planning on staying a couple of days, I have something important I would like to ask you both‚Ä¶‚Äù* I knew their confused looks well. This was the day they hoped wouldn‚Äôt happen. Only now did I wish to ask them tomorrow after some rest. The warm glow of the fireplace felt good as my mother laid down a plate and my favorite drink in front of me. *‚Äú Look, maybe tonight we can just focus on the fact I'm here, so how have you guys been?...‚Äù* They seemed to smile, almost liking the idea. My father sat warming his hands thinking about the question. *‚Äú we‚Äôre doing ok i'm still retired of course..lucy been remodeling the place so it is about the same here‚Ä¶. Liz, are you really wanting to know about your real mother?‚Äù* ¬†



I froze as the two waited for my answer, *‚Äú well I wanted to learn about her and what type of life she had‚Ä¶ I'm sorry, maybe we should wait until we‚Äôre all rested.‚Äù* I felt foolish for even asking but Lucy only stood sitting next to me, her soft hands taking mine. *‚Äú You know I had alway wondered when you would ask us, but I agree tonight we should just catch up and tomorrow we will tell all we know.‚Äù* The gentle smile she gave me only made me worry that there was a horrible past in my mother‚Äôs life. We spent the next few hours only talking about everything but my mother, still my mind couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her at all. Even after we said goodnight I couldn‚Äôt sleep my thoughts only keeping me from closing my eyes, *‚Äú you shouldn‚Äôt be so scared liz, you wanted to know after all‚Ä¶ but still this information could aid you in stopping the evil in rizepoint.‚Äù ‚Äú Why do I fear learning the truth more than ever? I mean don‚Äôt you already know if I'm tied to your family.‚Äù* she seemed to stay quiet as the darkness of the room made me uneasy, *‚Äúmercy? Come on, just let me know‚Ä¶"""" I'm sorry but I really don‚Äôt know your family‚Äôs history, most of all if you're tied with us at all. But sometimes we must learn the hardest truths in order to become stronger in ourselves‚Ä¶ you have some special connection to us..¬† That‚Äôs all I know.‚Äù* she was quiet for the rest of the night, leaving me to my thoughts once again only my foster parents would truly be able to shine a light on all of this. By early morning I awoke smelling pancakes and coffee, *‚Äú there she is well good morning, come sit down food will be ready soon‚Ä¶ you sleep ok?‚Äù* ¬†Paul was alway an early riser while me and Lucy would alway sleep in, of course the memories of my childhood seemed to flood my mind. *‚Äú yeah the best I could anyway, just a lot for me to think about these days‚Ä¶. Remember the front page piece I was telling you about?‚Äù* He only shook his head seeing the fear in my eyes, *‚Äú liz you don‚Äôt have to be scare that why we took you in, cause we wanted to show you that you are loved‚Ä¶ in fact we hoped you ask us about jamie.‚Äù* I lean back almost in wonder now I know her name, *‚Äúwhat really happened to her? ‚ÄúThey said she died giving birth to me‚Ä¶but I alway felt like she was in my life longer than that‚Ä¶‚Äù* He looked almost unsure before standing and walking over to a nearby table, *‚Äú you know the day we took you in, we were given this file in order to understand about your mother‚Ä¶ of course I was shocked by everything it had told us. But Lucy didn‚Äôt want you to see this at all, she felt you wouldn‚Äôt be able to take the truth‚Ä¶ liz I feel you need to see this now more than ever. Just don‚Äôt tell Lucy I still had it ok?‚Äù* he handed me a tan folder the edges seemed worn and folded, I nodded understanding the fear in his eyes.¬†



*‚Äú I promise not to say a word‚Ä¶.‚Äù* he nodded and smiled relieved *‚Äú Jamie was a good mother liz she loved you‚Ä¶but she alway seemed to think something was after her. I should know cause she would tell me throughout the years that she fears for both of you‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú you knew her?...‚Äù* he stopped almost giving an odd sad expression, *‚Äú yes liz we both knew her well‚Ä¶ I was hoping we didn‚Äôt have to talk about this so early‚Ä¶‚Äù* Lucy stood in the doorway watching as Paul just leaned back looking toward the window, her eyes filled with tears. *‚Äú you know how we were able to take you in like this? We begged the state to let you live with us‚Ä¶ it was her last request before she‚Ä¶‚Äù* she broke as her body fell against the wall, her tears flowing down her face. *‚Äú She died another way didn‚Äôt she‚Ä¶ I'm sorry guys, maybe I was wrong to ask in the first place.‚Äù* Lucy only looked up, wiping away the tears before grabbing my hand, *‚Äú no you need to know we kept this from you for far too long, your mother died not by childbirth‚Ä¶but by murder. Paul was the unlucky one to find her dead.‚Äù* I understood paul‚Äôs silence now we all stood letting the quietness of the room fill our minds, before lucy just smiled *‚Äú well breakfast is ready how about we just enjoy the fact you came to visit‚Ä¶no more talk of this matter ok?‚Äù* I agreed knowing it was best for them, we spent the first few hours talking about my job and the piece. Their mood seemed to brighten into the afternoon as we sat outside taking in the fresh air, all I could think about was the file and all the information Paul couldn‚Äôt tell me. Whatever happened to my mother, Paul and Lucy suffered more than I knew, by the evening I retired to bed only to be unable to sleep. *‚Äú I could look at the file no one is awake, but I promised Paul not to even open in this house‚Ä¶.‚Äù* I hated having answers but not being able to see them, still I knew Paul would be upset if I had broken the promise.¬†



I spent the rest of the weekend being unable to focus as lucy took us down to the lake, paul went fishing as he left us girls to take in the sun. *‚Äú it‚Äôs horrible that rizepoint is going through such a nightmare‚Ä¶ but again I remember that town alway so dull and boring‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú you sound like the murders are a good thing? Everyone is scared to death, the town has never been so busy of late.‚Äù* she looked at me shocked and confused before taking a drink, *‚Äú well shit I didn‚Äôt mean like that‚Ä¶of course the murders are horrible no town should have to deal with that..but it‚Äôs just strange having something happen in rizepoint.‚Äù* ¬†I couldn‚Äôt disagree with her as long as I had lived there. The worst thing you could hear of was someone breaking into a shop or kids stealing candy from the old candy store. Still I wondered about Robin. She really didn‚Äôt have family living there, in fact she moved out of the city to get away from them. *‚Äú I wish you could stay longer but I understand you have important things to finish‚Ä¶ liz?‚Äù* my mind snapped back as she just looked worried, *‚Äú sorry space off again, I know but I have to leave tomorrow my piece needs to be done and well im have to check on somethings.‚Äù* she only smiled before laying back on her chair, again my mind seemed to wonder about the file and how my mother‚Äôs life truly was like. By early morning I packed my car looking back on our home, paul only smiled before giving me a hug. *‚Äú Please don‚Äôt be a stranger, come visit more often‚Ä¶. We miss you alot liz‚Ä¶""Lucy* only nodded looking sad, her expression seemed lost and confused, *‚Äú I promise guys I miss coming here as well, look i better get back on the road‚Ä¶ I love you guys!!* This made her smile. She grabbed my hands before pulling me close, Lucy's eyes studying me before she let me go. *‚Äú for what‚Äôs its worth your mother would be proud of who you became, I know the feeling Its the same I had. I'm proud to call you my daughter. Drive safe and make sure to call us more ok‚Ä¶..‚Äù* I watched the house fade from the rear view mirror only allowing myself to think about the life they gave me.¬† I had answers now about my past‚Ä¶about my mother, still Paul's words seemed to play in my head. Either way I had to focus on helping rizepoint and stop this killer from harming anyone else. ‚Äú*There are more of my memories I would like to show you‚Ä¶ I'm sorry liz in advance but these are ones that I hoped to never see again.‚Äù* ¬†her tone sounded¬†

Unsure as she spoke, had the darkest parts of her memories held her in an odd control? I made it into town by early afternoon, the diner was still closed as two cop cars were stationed along with crowds placing flowers next to a wall with robin‚Äôs picture. ‚Äú *im sorry robin you didn‚Äôt desire this..you were just trying to live like the rest of us‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt worry I will find your killer.‚Äù* I arrived home only looking back at the file, before grabbing my stuff and heading toward my door. My mind couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the truth of my mother‚Äôs life. Once inside I sat back tired and worn feeling my eyes wanting to close, only for a few minutes did I find sleep dreaming of nothing but sweet memories that seemed lost to me. I only slept for an hour before I awoke my mind still focused on the file that laid on the table in front of me.¬†¬†¬†

  


Pulling the report closer I started to read what the police and social worker stated, their words seemed cold and uninviting. *‚Äú Upon entering the home there was nothing proving the claims of mistreatment, while Ms. Adams had freely let us in; she seemed fearful‚Ä¶ of something we may have found or just the fact we were in her home. Either way the child seems healthy and happy, plenty of food aligns the shelves and the child herself seemed to tell us her mother takes great care of her. The only thing I fear most has ms. Adams' middle bedroom, inside we found strange books and items that point toward some strange type of witchcraft‚Ä¶ while this is not grounds to pull the child from her home. We have agreed to let ms. Adams keep her child on the terms that she provides a monthly statement of funds through paychecks and rare visits to ensure everything is up to code.‚Äù*¬† I was beside myself. My mother was trying to help me the best she could, only I stopped reading the part about her hobby‚Ä¶ was my mother a witch? This was a clear answer as I noticed more in the report, but it seemed that these visits were never bad. In fact she passed each one‚Ä¶ the social worker seemed happy each time she came to see us.I looked through that file for hours unable to focus on anything else, finding more about my life than I had ever known. By the evening my eyes could barely stay open, I had been awake for so long my body was weak and unable to ready anymore. Heading up to bed, sleep took me right away, I awoke on a strange road as the rain poured down onto the trees around me. I could see a car in the distance flipped onto the side, and a figure hanging upside down from the seat‚Ä¶ they call out for anyone to help them but no one is around. My heart racing I tried to grab their hand, only to panic as Maggie's face looked up at me..¬† I cried out once more calling out to her but she only faded leaving me to watch her body fall. I was shocked awake hitting the ground, my mind still fearful of what I had seen. *‚Äú It was just a dream‚Ä¶. It had to be a dream. She is fine‚Ä¶ calm yourself‚Ä¶‚Äù* again I could feel mercy‚Äôs coldness wrapping around me, her voice gently filling my mind.¬†



*‚Äú you should check on her‚Ä¶. I doubt it was a dream but something will pass if you don‚Äôt stop it in time‚Ä¶‚Äù* what is this a new ability I have awakened? Either way I grabbed my phone knowing well it was barely after 6:00 am, still I had to know if she was ok‚Ä¶. Her phone seemed to ring for a few minutes before the click ended the call. *‚Äú she is not answering me‚Ä¶. What am I going to do now?!‚Äù* I even tried her text but she did something unthinkable, blocking my number for good. Hot tears ran down my face. I had lost my best friend because of something I couldn‚Äôt help‚Ä¶ Now I truly felt mercy's sadness as she had the same happen to her. Into the late morning I arrived at work still noticing that Vincent was out still, no matter all I wanted was to be left alone. I sat down starting to write on my piece knowing well how important this was, not just for me but for the town. The words flowed onto the screen of my computer almost making me forget about late night, the quietness of my office was calming only the gentle wind from my window seemed to whisper in my¬† ear. *‚Äú liz? I was wondering if we could talk real quick‚Ä¶.‚Äù*¬†

Betty stood in my doorway, her worried expression making me wonder as I waved in. she shut the door as she sat down, looking around the office before speaking up. ‚Äú Maggie told me you two aren‚Äôt friends anymore‚Ä¶what happened..I know it may be hard but I have to know.‚Äù remembering the events I sat back running my fingers through my hair, her eyes looking upon me in hopes that she could fix this. *‚Äú I don‚Äôt know exactly how it ended so quickly‚Ä¶ Betty, I found out something she didn‚Äôt want anyone to know. I don‚Äôt blame her for blocking my number and walking out of my life‚Ä¶ everyone does it at some point.‚Äù* she quickly rushed around the desk pulling me into a hug, her sweet perfume filling my nose *‚Äú now don‚Äôt go talking like that liz you meant alot to me and to the people of rizepoint.. You fight for us everyday and don‚Äôt think we don‚Äôt see it.‚Äù ‚Äú I have lost Maggie Betty. She stopped being friends with me because she couldn‚Äôt take the chance of what I have been going through‚Ä¶ again I don‚Äôt blame her.‚Äù* my mind was so broken at that moment seeing memories of us playing as kids, swimming down at lake and even the sunny days we would run through the woods.



*‚Äú Betty, please do one thing for me‚Ä¶don‚Äôt let her drive anywhere today by herself‚Ä¶ I fear something bad will happen to her.‚Äù* she looked confused but saw the panic on my face, quickly nodding. She sat back down almost wondering what I knew, *‚Äú liz? What are you saiding‚Ä¶.. Is she in danger?‚Äù* I paused only before she tried calling her, over it went to voicemail Betty of course looked worried as she placed the phone back on my desk. *‚Äú I should say she's fine Betty and that nightmare was just due to all this happening‚Ä¶forget I said anything.‚Äù* this seemed to make her smile just a bit, before giving me another hug finally she waved goodbye leaving me to finish my paper. I could barely focus on the drive home, Maggie was all I could think of, I had seen into her past a memory she didn‚Äôt want to remember‚Ä¶ and yet I made her live all over again. *‚Äú don‚Äôt blame yourself for what powers you have gained through the notebook, Maggie just needs time to understand what you're going through as well.‚Äù* She spoke the truth. I didn't ask for any of this to happen, but now it was up to time and hope to bring Maggie back. Grabbing the notebook I studied it again, letting the old leather go across my skin, *‚Äú come liz it‚Äôs time you learn the darkest parts of my life‚Ä¶ prepare yourself I doubt you will never be the same after this.‚Äù* The bright light swallowed me again as I stood on the farm, mercy worked endlessly preparing for the trip. Only her mother stood, tears falling, almost holding onto something, her words didn‚Äôt seem familiar to me‚Ä¶it was almost like she was doing a spell of protection over her daughter. *‚Äú mother please hide away while i'm gone, i dare not think what the judge will do if he should come here‚Ä¶‚Äù* Mercy's eyes tried and her body worn from the extra work, *‚Äú my mother was fearful I wouldn‚Äôt return‚Ä¶ you see we had no food of our own‚Ä¶the judge took every last bit we had.‚Äù*



*‚Äú that cart was all for the village‚Ä¶ how did you two get along with nothing for the winter?‚Äù* she paused, placing her cold hands onto my own, *‚Äú my mother was doing a spell for a reason.. I had enough of the judge and decided to hide some of the food away in order for us to live, we had no choice but to stand and fight‚Ä¶even if I was the only one to do so.‚Äù* I followed her as she climbed onto the cart, holding out her hand she only smiled‚Ä¶ *‚Äú Come, I have much to show you‚Ä¶ so much to tell of the darkness you're facing.‚Äù* the woods around closing in as I noticed mercy‚Äôs mother waving in the distance, to see mercy traveling alone make me wonder how much fear was going through her mind‚Ä¶ although this was just a memory I wanted to tell her she wasn‚Äôt alone at all. Her ghostly figure sitting almost still looking toward her living body, *‚Äú it is strange to see yourself still breathing‚Ä¶knowing that this is all just memories of things you had to live through?‚Äù ‚Äú Yes I sometimes forget I'm dead, until I try to reach for her‚Ä¶ only my hand goes through her‚Ä¶she doesn‚Äôt know the danger that lies ahead.‚Äù* The air around us was chilly as the first signs of winter were calling, mercy wrapped her coat around herself trying to keep warm‚Ä¶ we traveled for a few hours before the village had come into view. The villagers seemed to look on with disguise as mercy only kept her looking forward, until she arrived in front of the same large house. *‚Äú I have brought what we promised‚Ä¶ ""*The older man just nodded, waving over a few of the council members, taking the food off the cart. She seemed only fearful, hoping to leave this place soon. *‚Äú The judge had requested that you bring medicine as well the next trip, he said you would understand what type of medicine he asks for.‚Äù* Mercy's eyes told the true rage that fill her head, but she nodded knowing it was best not to give herself away. *‚Äú And pray tell where is the judge is normally here to receive the items himself?‚Äù* the members only looked up before the older man just smiled, *‚Äú yes you're right he does normally deal with this himself..but he is busy with something very important today‚Ä¶ but don‚Äôt worry I will let him know you¬† arrive on time as alway.‚Äù* her ghostly figure upturn expression only made me want to help mercy, *‚Äú Richard carmine such a foolish old man, but he was the kindest of the council..well to a point. He wrote the very codes that the village followed‚Ä¶ It was Henry Clifton that you wanted to watch out for. The judge appointed him as the law itself making sure everyone followed them‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have much time.. come ....‚Äù*¬†



Again the bright light blinded me as she took my hand, we now stood back on the farm but I could tell there was something off. Mercy guided me into the house where she and her mother sat in front of the fireplace, their expressions showing fear as they prepared strange items into glass bottles. *‚Äú mercy please tell me you didn‚Äôt really leave some food for us, the judge will surely know some is missing.‚Äù ‚Äú don‚Äôt worry mother, he won't know I make sure to make the cart look full as alway, I have done this twice now and he doesn‚Äôt seem to notice. Im not letting us dead from hunger‚Ä¶ anyway we should get this medicine done‚Ä¶ after I figured if he wants medicine then we give him something alright‚Ä¶‚Äù* her tone seemed cold, almost like she was putting something dangerous into the mixture, her mother only looked shocked before picking up one of the bottles. Swirling the mixture she notices a black cloud before it faded back to clear water again, ‚Äú mercy! Nightshade you will be making sure those people die instead of helping them, the judge is the one to blame, not the whole village! We can‚Äôt give these to them‚Ä¶ you do not think clearly my dear‚Ä¶‚Äù Mercy only shook her head almost unaffected by her words, *‚Äú there was something my mother didn‚Äôt know about the village, everyone inside was not as innocent as she thought‚Ä¶ I saw children being killed by their own families when ordered by the judge. And the worst of it all during cold winter's night‚Ä¶ if they did run out of food the weakest person was used to feeding the village.‚Äù* I couldn‚Äôt even believe what she was saiding, the village was full of monsters, those children must have suffered so much..but she only pointed toward the fireplace again.¬†



*‚Äú I had lost myself as well on the cold winter's night, barely able to keep a fire going‚Ä¶ My mother is only growing weak due to the lack of food we were trying to save.¬† Liz I can‚Äôt rest knowing what I had become‚Ä¶ my hate fuels me, turning me into something horrible.‚Äù* she stepped toward the corner of the room, only stopping before the glow made me look‚Ä¶ a large box stood on the table. *‚Äú The symbol looks just the same as the one I have at home, and on my arm‚Ä¶ mercy what does it mean?‚Äù* she only paused before placing her hand on the box itself, it seemed to react to her touch almost glowing even brighter than before. *‚Äú That symbol had nothing to do with my family, but it does mean something important to all who practice magic.. It holds a very dark power given to all of us. My mother had forbidden us from even opening the box‚Ä¶but I was so angry that I let this darkness into myself. So the judge and all who had wrong us would pay.‚Äù* My thoughts have gone back to the two murders, *‚Äú mercy really did you kill those two in rizepoint? ‚Äú No, believe me I kill in a different way, through my medicine I made with that nightshade would kill off the whole village quietly‚Ä¶the one who killed those poor people is doing this for sport.* I didn‚Äôt know why but I believed she was telling the truth, only for a moment did I wonder about the darkness she feared.¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
