A banger every single time! I am only a month into the craft coffee world but I am beyond blown away. The best coffee I had before this was starbucks. I drink all my coffee black so I get to really enjoy the true flavors. I would have never thought a cup of black coffee could be sweet on its own. I thought all black coffee was bitter/sour/and tasted all the same. BURNT. I fear what will happen once I try espresso ü§£üòÖ",1,1762013253.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

It appears to have just overheated, but why? I leave my work computer on all the time, sometimes for days, sometimes with apps running and nothing has ever been a problem.   
   
What about leaving it to upload would cause it to overheat like that? Uploading shouldn't be a CPU or GPU intensive process, what would make it hot at all?

Me , My bff (Jay) & Her friend (Dee) were in the mirror talking and getting ready. My bff who has a bf (we were at his house) Stated that she has a crush on a girl. In the middle of her explaining this crush she goes to say ‚Äúas soon as her crush called and opened her mouth she asked if her crush was hungry and opened her wallet‚Äù. Me and Dee was like whoah huh you never asked if we were hungry , good or needed anything. She then tries to say she does do things and we had to tell her she actually doesn‚Äôt and then she admitted she doesn‚Äôt and should be a better friend and tried to hug me but I pushed her away in a playful manner. I was upset and sat on the couch and for 45 minutes she was trying to redeem herself by over explaining and even coming up with some bs story to make herself feel better from the thought of everyone realizing that we deserve a better friend. I was sort of high on MJ so I had alot thoughts of like dang she actually doesn‚Äôt ask if we are good and we give alot to her. 
This the kicker , This isn‚Äôt to count favors but I have done alot for my bff. I recently gotten a new car and Lended her my old one to get around , Only letting her pay HALF of the insurance for that. At one point we were always together I would pay for our food. I took her dog in when she desperately needed a home for the dog , I also Helped her get a good paying job where I work so she could get back into school and get money for her tuition. Also even helped her get side gig money and helped with certain skills. Plus getting a laptop for her for her school work when she was in college at the time plus MORE. I watched her buy a guy she barely knew 3 Polo t shirts, The guy she is with and complains about when she calls me and never ask how im doing she gives him alot which is cool they are together I dont care.Then it clicked to me. She has never asked me if I was good or hungry or if she could treat me to coffee or cheap brunch. When I get large amounts of weed she gets upset if i split it evenly with her and my other friends instead of giving her most of it. I think last night it clicked to me that I over give . I was upset but calmed myself down last night to enjoy the night with my plan of waking up and doing heavy thinking & rearranging of my life to understand this better. 


TL:DR : I had a moment of clarity last night that my best friend doesn‚Äôt give back the same energy I give her. She shows care and generosity toward others (like her crush or boyfriend) but rarely checks in on me or does thoughtful things in return, even though Ive helped her a lot lending my car, helping her get a job, supporting her financially, etc.

When called out, she got defensive instead of truly accountable. The realization hit that I overgive in the friendship and it‚Äôs time to rethink my boundaries and what I actually want from people moving forward.",1,1762013187.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

[****](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pfydgg/my_22m_roommate_22f_and_i_are_stuck_in_a_messed/)

Our mutual friend set us up. We are both working at the same company. we have been staying together for 14 months. we have about 9 months left on the lease. She is a great roommate and we usually stay out of reach others way. I had a crush on her at the start.

About 3 months ago. It was my birthday. She brought booze and we ended up having sex. we haven't stopped since. We have sex and cuddle a bit and then go on with our day. She is always the one who initiates. we are not exclusive or anything. Heck, she even slept with me after coming back from a bad date. I want more but I am unable to even talk about it. We have a pretty decent thing going and I don't want to mess it up. I feel really great about it and sometimes I feel like shit about it. I don't know what the fuck I am going to do.

I feel pathetic for feeling this way, I am sleeping with an girl way out of my league. I shouldn't be moping around about her not wanting to be more than just FWB but she also does things for. Yesterday night she got me my favorite dish when she went out. She also sit next to me when I have minor panic attacks. She cares for me but I don't think she thinks of me as boyfriend material. we just are stuck in an very strange place. I need some advice to handle it and talk about it.

TLDR : I am in a FWB situation with my roommate where we both are crossing boundaries into relationship territory and I don't know how to deal with it.

>Ask her to grab a meal or coffee with you. See if she wants to go for a walk. Ask her to do stuff with you that you'd do with friends. Get to know her outside of being co-workers and roommates. You don't have to rush into being boyfriend/girlfriend. My now husband and I hung out and went on dates for like 6 months before we made it official. I think ""courtship"" is usually used to describe old timey relationships or super religious couplings. But I think that it can be a really helpful way to find out if you're compatible with someone.

Never thought I would be updating this. I took the advice and decided to take it slow and just not spill my feelings but the idea of spending time with her without telling her my feelings felt terrible. I was pretty miserable for two days and she ended up asking me why I looked awfully sad and if she could do anything to fix my mood.

I spilled all my feelings for her, it was probably the most unromantic confession ever. She was really surprised that I was into her. We spend the whole night talking. She told me she had been crushing on me for ever since we moved in. She said she never though someone as sweet as me could fall for a 'callous inconsiderate B' like her.

I have never heard Bullshit like that before, she is a bit cold and she doesn't smile a lot but that doesn't make her callous or inconsiderate. She has done a million things for me since we have moved in. I think we both realize that we could have been together way earlier if it wasn't for our fucked up self perception issues. We mostly joked about going to therapy and shit we went through growing up. She is fucked up too but in a way different way than I am. lol. On a serious note, we are both planning on going to therapy. We could have been together for so many months! but we both thought the other would never both with the other. wtf. My parents actively discouraged me from doing it and her parents said she needed therapy to be kinder. So haha. This is pretty scary but we both are gonna try to make this work.

TLDR : Talked to her, she had feelings for me, we are dating now and searching for therapist.

1olrj9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1olrj9u/aitah_for_wanting_to_kick_my_flatmine_out/,AITAH for wanting to kick my flatmine out?,"So, everyone, hello.

I've(25F) been living in my apartment for 5 years now and recently for a flatmate(28M). I am a usually very clean person who likes to wake up, have a bit of coffee and immediately start cleaning/making dinner since I cannot relax wirhout all the work done.

The flatmine of mine really values his clothes and asked me not wash them and for him to wash them himself, I kinda hate doing laundry so he offered to do it all, and I do the cleaning of the kitchen and bathroom and cook. Now, cooking is my passion so I love doing that and I enjoy cleaning it as well and I like a tidy bathroom, I clean it almost every day(I am saying this just so nobody thinks that I do more because I have to, I do more because I want to, plus the cooking isnt a chore for me, truly, it's a hobby.) 

The problem with laundry is that my flatmate has sleep apnea and he sometimes wets the bed. No biggie, he has his protective covers, but when it happens, all the sheets have to be changed, the pillows washed and the covers etc. That is fine by me, can't be angry at somebody for a health problem. But... the thing is... that he never fricking does the darn laundry. Like it will pile up and pile up to the point where we do not have towels, I do not have clothes and there are no protective covers plus the laundry has URINE on it. I know that I can just, you know, wash them at a high temperature and it will be okay, but currently there is so much laundry on the floor its hard navigating the room. There is I think 4 machine loads on the floor. 

The main problem is that he is an ""artist"" and he has to go to photoshoots, make music, concerts and is ""busy"". Last night was the final straw. He had a concert, drank, did some lines and went home, slept through the day, woke up and said ""hey im hungover, Ill do it tomorrow."" And I said okay, I was also a bit hungover but completely functional, just a tiny headache so I understood. That evening, I asked if he would then stay home tomorrow(today) and help clean, he said yes. Today, I woke up at 9, had my coffee, started cleaning, made food, cleaned the bathroom. He woke up, smoked 3 joints and put one load in the dryer. Then he came and started on a long fricking tangent how he just talked to a friend with whom he wasnt on good terms and they wanted to sort it out and how he needs to go out and meet him.  
I said alright and asked when he would be back, but he swears by being a very spontaneous person and he cant make concrete plans because ""I am just like that, i dont think that far ahead and I can change my mind any second"". But whatever, he told me, in his ""spontaneous"" fashion, that he wont be out for too long so that we can chill later in the evening. I said okay, then exactly before leaving, he told me that he will message if he decides to stay out past midnight.

Which means he will come home tired, probably drunk and greened out and say he will do it tomorrow and the entire thing will repeat.

So, Im pissed. Im so pissed that he is using my kindness against me and I really want to know if I am overreacting or not?

1olrfop,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1olrfop/feeling_very_sensitive_to_metylphenydate/,Feeling **very** sensitive to metylphenydate,"Hey everyone,

I am newly diagnosed with ADHD. 

For the background:
My doctor told me to follow the following protocol to find what the right dose of metylphenydate for me, before trying to find the right formulation (IR vs ER)

-Begin with 10mg IR (Ritaline) the first week in the morning

-2x10mg IR the second (current week) in the morning

-2x10mg IR in the morning + 10mg at lunch the third week

2x10mg IR in the morning + 2x10mg at lunch the fourth week 

The first week felt pretty bad. Feeling way too anxious, with still having some attention leap sometime. Racing heartbeat then suddenly it could lower. Feeling some light pressure in my chest on the left (light restrosternal pain?)

Second week: felt way less anxious and calmer m, but two very notables things happened.  Still feeling the retrosternal pressure though 

On Wednesday no energy after 3PM felt like the mythical SF Fetanyl zombies people talk about on social medias. Then a rebound. Thought racings and not possible to sleep before 5 am. I messed up by taking the second pill at lunch instead of the two at once, but still it shouldn‚Äôt have lasted as long. Called the doc who told me to make sure to take both at once, and report anything in the next days, and that we might need to switch to ER directly

Today until 2hrs ago: 2-3 hours after I felt very cold, had to put a sweat. I also had mild hallucinations. On three instances I saw something happen which didn‚Äôt happen. My father taking the car key, or being served first at the restaurant, or thinking I already had taken a coffee, just when the waiter arrived with it

It feels already like advanced intoxication effect at pretty mild dosage 

Sure not taking anything again until seeing my doc + getting an ECG done. But I feel very demoralised right now

Reba stood at the center of the Grand Hall, her head tilted slightly to the left‚Äîa habit that unsettled those who forgot she was blind. She didn't need eyes. The hall spoke to her in a thousand other ways: the rustle of formal robes against stone, the humidity shift when someone lied, the microscopic tremor in a voice that betrayed fear masquerading as courage.

Today, the hall reeked of performance.

The East Alliance delegation sat rigid in their seats, their breathing synchronized in that military way that suggested they'd rather be anywhere else. The West contingent sprawled with calculated informality, but their heart rates‚ÄîReba could hear them, faintly‚Äîwere elevated. Exhausted warriors playing at diplomacy.

And then there was the South Bloc.

They were *loud*. Not in volume‚Äîthough Representative 66's voice did carry, that peculiar resonance of a consciousness vibrating through a mechanical speaker‚Äîbut in intent. Every word was a performance, every gesture theatrical.

""‚Äîthis so-called Peace Compact is nothing more than subjugation!"" 66's voice crackled through his crawler's audio system. The spherical body shifted on its mechanical legs, and through the transparent sections of the shell, Reba could sense‚Äîthrough heat signatures her other senses painted‚Äîthe swirling gas cloud that was 66's true form.

Reba listened past the words to what lay beneath. Anger, yes. Rhetoric, certainly. But something else. Something that hadn't been there two weeks ago.

Sadness.

She filed it away.

""Representative 66,"" Reba said, her voice cutting through the chamber with the kind of quiet authority that ended arguments, ""your concerns are noted. As are the East's. And the West's. We will recess for the evening and reconvene‚Äî""

""Recess?"" One of the South delegates, a crystalline being whose name Reba could never quite pronounce, chimed with indignation. ""While our sovereignty is being dissolved?""

""Your sovereignty,"" Reba said, turning her head in the delegate's direction with unnerving precision, ""is being preserved by this conference. The alternative to peace is not independence. It is annihilation by those stronger than you.""

The truth hung in the air, ugly and undeniable.

Reba dismissed them with a gesture. As the delegates filed out, she remained, listening to their footsteps, cataloging their moods. The East and West were relieved. The South was furious.

And 66... 66's crawler moved differently. Slower. Like something was weighing him down.

*We crawled out of our own ashes after New Hope,* Reba thought. *Now we're expected to keep these fools from making their own pyre.*

She wondered, not for the first time, if humanity's real curse was not war, but the stubborn empathy that made them try to prevent it in others.

Chief Yarrow of the Furrian Security Contingent was an excellent actor. This was necessary, because right now he needed to appear catastrophically drunk.

He lurched around the corner of the service corridor, his russet fur slightly mussed, his tail swaying erratically, and nearly collided with Detective Arthur Dibble.

""Dibble!"" Yarrow's voice came out in a delighted yip, and he had to suppress the urge to grin at his own performance. ""Arthur! My friend!""

Dibble, to his credit, didn't even blink. Just caught Yarrow by the elbow and steadied him. ""Chief. You alright?""

""Alright? ALRIGHT?"" Yarrow dissolved into giggles, his ears flattening. ""Arthur, I've been watching the South... the *South Bloc*..."" He wheezed, wiping at his eyes. ""They're *furious* about the peace! Can you believe it? They'd rather see the galaxy burn than be 'saved'!""

He leaned in close, his breath smelling convincingly of Furrian whiskey. ""It's like watching a flock of angry, featherless birds trying to declare war on a hurricane!""

Dibble's expression didn't change, but Yarrow saw the slight shift in his posture. The detective was listening.

""And their champion‚Äî"" Yarrow had to pause, suppressing genuine laughter now. ""Their champion is 66. A gas cloud in a metal *ball*, Arthur. Leading the charge against peace."" He wiped his eyes again. ""Find out what's really going on before Reba loses patience and lets them blow themselves up.""

For just a moment, Yarrow's voice dropped, the slur vanishing. ""Watch 66. Something's changed with him.""

Then the drunk was back, swaying, giggling. ""Anyway! Must go. Important Chief business. Very important."" He patted Dibble's shoulder and lurched away down the corridor.

When he turned the corner and was safely out of sight, the giggling stopped. Yarrow's ears came up, alert. His tail straightened.

He pulled out a comm unit and spoke quietly. ""Dibble has been briefed. Now we wait.""

Then he allowed himself one genuine chuckle. A gas cloud and a metal ball. Trying to stop peace.

The galaxy was absolutely mad.

Dibble had been a detective long enough to know that 3 AM calls were never good news.

""Representative 66 is dead,"" the security officer said. ""We need you.""

The chamber was smaller than Dibble expected. Diplomats, he'd learned, often preferred intimate spaces despite their public personas. This room was almost cozy‚Äîif you ignored the inert mechanical crawler in the center and the faint, acrid smell that suggested something gaseous had dissipated badly.

66's crawler sat motionless, its legs locked in a final position. Through the transparent sections of the spherical body, Dibble could see... nothing. No swirling gas, no consciousness. Just empty space where a sentient being used to be.

A data-slate lay on the desk, its screen still active. Dibble read the text:

*""The Peace Compact is a death sentence for free worlds. If I must die to prove this truth, so be it. The South will never kneel to‚Äî""*

""Political assassination,"" the security officer said with confidence. ""Classic martyrdom setup. Some pro-peace fanatic must have‚Äî""

""Nobody touch anything,"" Dibble said quietly.

He approached the crawler slowly, examining it from multiple angles. The staging was obvious‚Äîtoo obvious. The manifesto positioned just so, the dramatic final message. Someone wanted this to look like political murder.

But Dibble wasn't interested in what someone wanted him to see. He was interested in what they'd forgotten to hide.

He knelt beside the crawler, examining the life-support systems. Standard atmospheric containment, filtration, nutrient dispersal for the gaseous matrix... and there. A microscopic port, barely visible. The kind used for calibration and maintenance.

Dibble pulled out his scanner. Chemical residue, recent. Something had been introduced directly into 66's environment. Something that would destabilize a gaseous consciousness.

He leaned closer and caught it: perfume. Faint, expensive, and distinctly human.

The door opened and the South Bloc delegates poured in. Dibble expected grief, shock, demands for justice.

Instead, he got energy.

""This is it!"" one of them said, their voice ringing with something uncomfortably close to triumph. ""This is the proof! The peace faction assassinated him!""

""They feared his voice!""

""They silenced him because he spoke truth!""

Dibble watched them rally around the corpse of their colleague like it was a campaign headquarters. Nobody was crying. Nobody was even pretending to mourn.

""We need to seal this room,"" the security officer said. ""Political assassination, clear motive, we'll have the tribunals ready by‚Äî""

""Give me forty-eight hours,"" Dibble said.

""Detective, this is clearly‚Äî""

""Forty-eight hours.""

The security officer looked at the energized South delegates, at the convenient manifesto, at Dibble's utterly calm expression.

""Forty-eight hours,"" he agreed.

Dibble's method was simple: follow the evidence that didn't fit the narrative.

The perfume didn't fit. Political assassins didn't wear perfume to crime scenes.

The chemical residue didn't fit. Why use a sophisticated, traceable destabilizing agent when a simple containment breach would look like an accident?

The manifesto *especially* didn't fit. Too perfect, too convenient, too exactly what the South wanted to see.

He interviewed the South delegates first. They were useless, too busy planning their political response to care about the actual murder. The East and West representatives were baffled and clearly just wanted to leave. Nobody had any useful information.

Except Reba.

""The perfume,"" Reba said when Dibble reported to her. ""Tell me about the perfume.""

""Human. Expensive. L'√âtoile Noire, if I'm identifying it correctly. Not common.""

""And the chemical used?""

""Xenobiology grade. Very specific. Would require detailed knowledge of gaseous species' consciousness matrices.""

Reba tilted her head. ""How many people at this conference have that knowledge?""

""I'm checking the roster now.""

He was in the archives, cross-referencing chemical access logs with delegate rosters, when Yarrow found him.

The Furrian chief looked perfectly sober now, but his ears were vibrating with suppressed laughter.

""Arthur,"" Yarrow said, his voice strangled. ""Arthur, I found something.""

""What?""

""The meeting logs. 66's private calendar."" Yarrow's tail was twitching. ""He had regular appointments. Weekly. Sometimes twice weekly. Always in his private chambers.""

""With who?""

""A human xenobiology consultant. Assigned to the South delegation."" Yarrow's voice cracked. ""Her name is Elara.""

Dibble looked up from his terminal.

""She wears L'√âtoile Noire,"" Yarrow continued, and now he was shaking with barely controlled laughter. ""And Arthur‚Äîthe appointment descriptions. He labeled them as 'philosophical discussions.'"" The Furrian had to sit down. ""How does a gas cloud... what could they possibly...""

He couldn't finish. He was laughing too hard.

Dibble stared at the calendar logs. Regular appointments. Private chambers. A human woman and a gaseous entity in a mechanical body.

""The South doesn't know,"" Yarrow managed to gasp out. ""They think it's political. Don't correct them yet.""

Dibble pulled up Elara's file. Xenobiology researcher. Published extensively on consciousness theory across species. Expert in gaseous-form sapience. Access to restricted chemicals. Wore expensive perfume.

And according to the logs, she'd been in 66's chamber the night he died.

""I need to review 66's private files,"" Dibble said.

Yarrow composed himself, wiping his eyes. ""I'll get you access.""

As the Furrian left, Dibble heard him dissolving into giggles again in the hallway.

It was 2 AM when Dibble finally cracked 66's private files. The encryption was good, but not good enough to stop someone who knew what they were looking for.

What he found wasn't political conspiracy. It wasn't South Bloc strategy sessions or anti-peace plotting.

It was philosophy. Poetry. Theoretical physics. Long, wandering discussions about the nature of consciousness, the meaning of existence, the possibilities of connection across species.

All shared with Elara.

The earliest messages were formal. Professional discussions about gaseous sapience, consciousness matrices, the mechanisms of sentience. But over months, they'd shifted.

**66**: *""Do you ever wonder if form matters? If consciousness is truly substrate-independent, are we not all the same in the ways that matter?""*

**Elara**: *""I think about it constantly. We're taught that biology is destiny, but I've never believed that. The mind is what matters. The self.""*

**66**: *""You understand. So few understand.""*

The messages became more frequent. More personal.

**Elara**: *""I had a dream about you last night. Isn't that absurd? How do I dream about someone I've never truly seen?""*

**66**: *""You see me more clearly than anyone ever has.""*

Dibble felt like he was intruding on something intensely private. But he kept reading, because somewhere in these messages was a murder.

The shift came about two months ago.

**Elara**: *""I've been researching containment systems. Theoretically, with the right modifications, a gaseous consciousness could maintain cohesion in a more... adaptive environment. Something less rigid than the crawler.""*

**66**: *""Why?""*

**Elara**: *""So you could be free. So we could... I don't know. Share space?""*

**66**: *""Elara...""*

**Elara**: *""Don't. Don't do that. Don't sound sad. We can solve this.""*

**66**: *""Some things cannot be solved. They can only be endured.""*

The messages became strained after that. Elara pushing, 66 retreating. Her becoming more desperate, him becoming more distant.

Three weeks ago:

**Elara**: *""I love you. I don't care if that's impossible. I love you.""*

**66**: *""I know.""*

**Elara**: *""That's all you have to say?""*

**66**: *""What would you have me say? That I feel the same? I do. That it changes anything? It doesn't.""*

**Elara**: *""We could find a way. Technology, science, something‚Äî""*

**66**: *""There is no way. We cannot touch. We cannot share breath. We cannot create life together. These are not social constructs, Elara. These are physics.""*

**Elara**: *""So what was this? What have we been doing?""*

**66**: *""Pretending. And I'm sorry.""*

The last message, sent the day before 66 died, unsent but saved in drafts:

**66**: *""I cannot give you what you need. I cannot be what you need. I am not even certain what I am anymore‚Äîrepresentative, consciousness, person? I wear causes like costumes. I was going to vote for peace, Elara. Did you know that? All my rhetoric, my grand speeches about the South's sovereignty‚ÄîI was going to abandon it all. Because you made me hope for something smaller. Something real. But hope without possibility is just cruelty. I'm sorry I let you fall. I'm sorry I fell with you.""*

Dibble sat back in his chair and rubbed his eyes.

The method was clear now. Elara had access to 66's chambers. She had the chemical knowledge. She understood gaseous consciousness better than almost anyone. She could have introduced the destabilizing agent through the life-support port during one of their regular meetings.

But the political staging‚Äîthe manifesto, the martyrdom narrative‚Äîthat was separate. Added later. Almost carelessly.

She'd killed him in private. The public spectacle was just... what? Spite? Anger at his politics that he was going to abandon anyway?

There was only one way to know.

Dibble closed the files and stood. He knew where to find her.

Elara's quarters were neat to the point of sterile. She opened the door when Dibble knocked, unsurprised to see him.

""Detective,"" she said. ""I've been expecting you.""

She looked exhausted. Her hair‚Äîdark, shot through with gray‚Äîwas pulled back in a hasty knot. She wasn't wearing perfume now. She looked like someone who'd stopped caring about appearances.

""May I come in?""

""Of course.""

The room was sparse. A bed, a desk covered in academic papers, a window looking out at the stars. No personal items, no decorations. Like she was living in a space she'd already left.

""I read the messages,"" Dibble said.

Elara nodded. She sat on the bed, her hands folded in her lap. ""All of them?""

""Enough.""

""Then you know."" It wasn't a question.

""I know the method. I know you had the access and the knowledge. I know about the chemical residue in his life-support system."" Dibble pulled out a chair from the desk and sat, keeping distance between them. ""What I don't know is why you staged it as political assassination.""

Elara laughed‚Äîa short, bitter sound. ""Do you know what it's like to fall in love with a voice in the dark?""

""Tell me.""

""We met because I was assigned to consult on South Bloc environmental needs. Gaseous species have complex requirements. I was supposed to ensure 66's crawler was properly maintained."" She looked at her hands. ""We started talking. Just talking. About ideas, theories. He was brilliant. Did you know that? Absolutely brilliant. His mind was...""

She trailed off, her eyes distant.

""I fell in love with his thoughts first. The way he conceptualized reality, consciousness, existence. Then his humor‚Äîhe was funny, Detective. Genuinely funny. He'd make jokes about being a 'cloud with aspirations.'"" Her smile was sad. ""And then... everything else. I fell in love with everything he was.""

""And he felt the same.""

""Yes."" The word was barely a whisper. ""He did. He told me he'd never connected with anyone the way he connected with me. That I made him feel seen. That consciousness is consciousness, regardless of form.""

""But form does matter.""

Elara's jaw tightened. ""Biology is not negotiable. That's what he said. We could never touch. Never share physical space without containment systems between us. Never..."" She stopped, swallowed hard. ""Never have children. Never truly share existence. Every moment would be mediated by technology, by barriers, by the fundamental incompatibility of our forms.""

""He knew this from the start.""

""Yes."" Her voice hardened. ""He knew. And he let me fall anyway. He let me hope, let me dream, let me love him‚Äîand then told me it was impossible. Not difficult. Not challenging. *Impossible*.""

""So you killed him.""

""So I killed him."" She said it simply, without emotion. ""I introduced a catalyst through his life-support system during our regular meeting. He didn't feel pain‚Äîgaseous consciousness doesn't work that way. He just... dispersed. Became not-himself.""

Dibble waited.

""The political staging came after,"" Elara continued. ""I was angry. Not just at him‚Äîat everything he represented. His politics were a lie too. Did you know he was going to vote for peace? Going to abandon the South Bloc he claimed to champion. Everything about him was performance."" Her voice was cold now. ""So I gave the South their martyr. Let them rally around his corpse. Let his hypocritical cause die with him. What do I care?""

""Did it help?""

The question seemed to surprise her. She looked at Dibble for the first time since starting her confession.

""No,"" she said quietly. ""Nothing helps.""

They sat in silence for a long moment. Outside the window, stars wheeled slowly past.

""You're not going to run,"" Dibble observed.

""Where would I go? And why?"" Elara stood, smoothing her clothes with automatic precision. ""I killed someone I loved because I couldn't have him. That's not something you run from. That's something you face.""

Dibble stood as well. ""I'll need you to come with me.""

""I know.""

At the door, Elara paused. ""Detective? Do you think I'm a monster?""

Dibble looked at her‚Äîthis woman who'd fallen in love with an impossibility and had broken under the weight of it.

""I think you're in pain,"" he said. ""That doesn't excuse what you did. But it explains it.""

""Is there a difference?""

""Always.""

The conference chamber was packed. Every delegate from every faction had been summoned by Reba's office with a simple message: *The investigation is concluded.*

The South Bloc delegates sat in the front, radiating anticipation. They'd spent two days building their narrative: martyred hero, silenced by peace-faction assassins, proof of the Compact's tyranny. They'd given speeches, held vigils, demanded justice and tribunals and blood.

Now they were going to get their validation.

Reba stood at the center of the room, her blind eyes fixed on nothing and everything. Beside her stood Dibble, holding a data-pad. Behind them, flanked by security, was Elara.

""The investigation into Representative 66's death has concluded,"" Reba began, her voice carrying perfectly in the silent chamber. ""Detective Dibble will present the findings.""

Dibble stepped forward. He'd delivered dozens of these reports, but never one quite like this.

""Representative 66 was killed by the introduction of a chemical catalyst into his life-support system,"" Dibble said, his voice level and professional. ""The catalyst destabilized his gaseous consciousness matrix, resulting in permanent dispersal. The method required detailed knowledge of gaseous species biology and direct access to his environmental systems.""

The South delegates were leaning forward, ready to hear the name of the peace-faction assassin.

""The person responsible is Elara, consultant to the South Bloc delegation.""

Confusion rippled through the chamber.

""One of our own?"" A South delegate stood. ""Why would she‚Äî""

""Elara and Representative 66 were involved in a personal relationship,"" Dibble continued. ""The relationship had lasted approximately eight months. It began as an intellectual connection and evolved into a romantic attachment.""

The silence was profound.

""The relationship ended when both parties acknowledged its biological impossibility. Representative 66 informed Elara that they could never achieve physical intimacy, shared existence, or reproductive partnership due to fundamental species incompatibility. Elara killed him as a result of this rejection.""

Someone in the back started to laugh. A nervous, disbelieving sound that cut off quickly.

""The political staging‚Äîthe manifesto, the martyrdom narrative‚Äîwas added by Elara after the fact, as an act of anger toward Representative 66's political hypocrisy. I have recovered communications indicating that 66 intended to vote in favor of the Peace Compact, contrary to his public stance.""

The South Bloc section erupted.

""This is absurd!""

""A fabrication!""

""You expect us to believe‚Äî""

Reba raised one hand and the room fell silent.

""Detective Dibble's findings are supported by forensic evidence, recovered communications, and Elara's full confession,"" Reba said. ""There was no political assassination. There was no peace-faction conspiracy. There was no martyrdom."" Her voice was cold, clinical. ""There was a failed romance between incompatible species.""

She turned her head toward the South Bloc delegates with that unnerving precision.

""You have spent two days building a war narrative around a lover's quarrel.""

The chamber exploded into noise. East and West delegates were trying to process the absurdity. The South was trying to salvage their narrative, but the laughter‚Äîuncomfortable, disbelieving, spreading like wildfire‚Äîwas making it impossible.

A gaseous entity and a human woman. Impossible love. Murder born of heartbreak.

The grand political crisis collapsed into cosmic embarrassment.

Reba let it continue for exactly thirty seconds. Then she spoke, and somehow her voice carried over the chaos.

""This conference is concluded.""

The room fell silent.

""The South Bloc has wasted this assembly's time with theater built on tragedy. The East and West are too exhausted to continue negotiations that clearly have no foundation. And the Earth Alliance‚Äî"" She paused, and something like disgust colored her voice. ""The Earth Alliance is done mediating for factions that would rather perform than negotiate.""

""Representative Reba, you can't just‚Äî""

""I can,"" Reba said. ""And I am. Earth withdraws from mediation. The Peace Compact is tabled indefinitely. You are all dismissed to sort yourselves out‚Äîor not. Frankly, we no longer care.""

She turned and walked from the chamber, her movements precise despite her blindness. Dibble and the security escorts followed with Elara.

Behind them, the galaxy's delegates sat in stunned silence, their grand political crisis reduced to an embarrassing footnote about impossible love and poor judgment.

The observation deck was nearly empty. Most of the delegations had already departed, fleeing the conference in various states of humiliation and confusion. Through the massive windows, ships were visible against the star field, running lights blinking as they prepared to jump.

Chief Yarrow stood at the railing, his tail swaying slowly. Dibble joined him, two cups of coffee in hand. He offered one to the Furrian, who accepted it with a nod of thanks.

""She's on the transport,"" Yarrow said quietly, referring to Elara. ""Headed to Earth for trial.""

""I know.""

""The South delegation left an hour ago. Without ceremony, without speeches. I've never seen delegates move that fast."" Yarrow's ears twitched. ""The East and West are confused. They're not sure whether to be relieved or worried.""

""Relieved,"" Dibble said. ""War was averted, even if peace wasn't achieved.""

""Averted by absurdity."" Yarrow sipped his coffee. ""A murder too ridiculous to weaponize. A crisis too embarrassing to rally around."" He was quiet for a moment. ""You know what the worst part is? 66 was actually going to vote for peace. He was going to be the reasonable one. And he died for love, not politics.""

""Life is complicated.""

""Life is stupid,"" Yarrow corrected, but there was no humor in his voice. ""A brilliant mind, genuine connection, real love‚Äîand it meant nothing because physics said no.""

They watched another ship depart, its engines flaring bright before it vanished.

""You did good work,"" Yarrow said. ""Most detectives would have stopped at the political angle. Neat, clean, expected. You found the truth.""

""The truth made everything worse.""

""Truth usually does."" Yarrow turned to look at Dibble. ""Do you know why I work with humans, Arthur?""

""Because Furrian Command assigned you?""

""Because you taught us something we didn't have."" Yarrow's voice was serious now, no trace of the giggling drunk from two days ago. ""You humans‚Äîyou live in tragedy and farce simultaneously. You've known both so intimately that you can hold them in your mind at the same time without breaking.""

He gestured at the empty chamber behind them. ""These species? They only understand one or the other. The South sees everything as grand tragedy. The East and West see only tactical necessity. But humans?"" He shook his head. ""You can see that a murder is both a cosmic heartbreak and an absurd comedy. That peace can fail and the galaxy can keep spinning. That sometimes the truth is just... stupid.""

""Is that a compliment?""

""It's an observation."" Yarrow's ears flicked forward. ""Reba is human. You're human. You both saw what needed to be seen‚Äîthat sometimes the thing preventing war isn't grand speeches or political maneuvering. It's just making the war too embarrassing to fight.""

""We didn't save the peace.""

""No,"" Yarrow agreed. ""You made the war too stupid to happen. And you know what? That might be more valuable.""

He raised his coffee cup in a small salute. ""To the human detective who found heartbreak inside a metal ball. To the blind negotiator who heard lies in perfect speeches. To the species that survived its own apocalypse and decided to keep everyone else from having theirs‚Äîeven when they don't want to be saved.""

Dibble clinked his cup against Yarrow's. ""That's humanity's specialty?""

""That's what we learned from you,"" Yarrow said. ""The galaxy is mad, Arthur. It's tragic and absurd and stupid and heartbreaking all at once. Most species can only see one aspect at a time. But humans? You see all of it.""

He drained his coffee and set the cup on the railing. ""That's why you're still necessary. Even when you fail, you fail in ways that matter.""

They stood in silence, watching the last of the ships depart. Somewhere out there, Elara was being transported to trial for killing someone she loved. Somewhere, the South Bloc was trying to salvage their dignity. Somewhere, the East and West were planning their next moves in a galaxy that refused to make sense.

And here, on this station, two investigators stood watching it all with clear eyes.

The peace had failed. The conference was over. The war hadn't started.

Sometimes, that was the best you could hope for.

""Come on,"" Yarrow said, pushing away from the railing. ""Reba wants a debrief. And I need you to keep a straight face when I file this report, because if I start laughing again, Command will think I've lost my mind.""

""A gaseous entity and a human consultant,"" Dibble said.

""In love,"" Yarrow added.

""Killed over biological incompatibility.""

""Which prevented a war.""

They looked at each other.

""The galaxy is absolutely mad,"" they said in unison.

Yarrow's tail wagged despite himself. ""At least we have each other to make sense of the nonsense.""

They walked away from the observation deck together, leaving the empty station and departed ships behind. Tomorrow, there would be reports to file, superiors to brief, consequences to manage.

Tonight, there was just the shared understanding that sometimes truth was stranger than anyone wanted it to be‚Äîand that someone had to bear witness to it anyway.

The galaxy would keep spinning. Tragedies would keep unfolding. Absurdities would keep mounting.

And somewhere, humans would keep finding the thread that connected them all, even when no one else could see it.

It wasn't heroism. It wasn't glory.

It was just the work.

And it was enough.

1olrcrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/portangeles/comments/1olrcrk/big_bloated_budget/,Big Bloated Budget,"Current economic trends tell a story of reduced grants and declining state support. Both the state and the county have recognized this cold reality. Yet the City of Port Angeles proposes its largest budget ever, $189 million, or roughly $9,400 per citizen, with another staffing increase. Even worse, the city can‚Äôt balance this budget without tapping into reserves by $26.3 million, while also planning to raise $5.3 million through higher utility fees.¬† A quick look at page 39 of the budget shows all of the **RED** ink.¬† Rather than reducing spending, the city‚Äôs path forward is to consume our surplus.¬† One of the big talking points of the Comprehensive Plan is sustainability, yet the 2026 budget is unsustainable.¬†¬†¬†¬†



At the October 28th special City Council meeting, the budget presentation was followed by only a few superficial questions. The meeting was adjourned early, no public comment was allowed, and Council showed no interest in scheduling a follow-up.



Port Angeles is a full-service city. Streets, Fire, Police, Water, Sewer, and Electric are essential and expensive. The city works hard to secure grant funding for these needs, but it also leans heavily on taxes and fees to support its ever-expanding wish list. The problem isn‚Äôt ambition; it‚Äôs bloat. We need to focus on core services, not ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù projects wrapped in feel-good language.



Page 12 of the 2026 Budget proudly displays a ‚ÄúDistinguished Budget Presentation Award‚Äù from the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). My response: How about not? GFOA‚Äôs own Top 10 Budget Best Practices are free, and the City follow these.



Instead, we get 276 pages of self-promotion and glossy photos. How many administrative hours went into producing this coffee-table book? How about we focus less on ‚Äúpretty‚Äù and more on granularity and accountability?



Go down to page 28 and find the Strategic Plan.¬† The financial problem our city faces can be found in the glowing words of the 100,000 things the city wants to accomplish.¬† I will only pick on one item to demonstrate its lofting goals.



*Improve community health and wellness or community resilience*

*‚Ä¢ Develop a community health and wellness plan by 12/31/2025.*

*‚Ä¢ Communicate policy and plan with community partners and residents by 12/31/2026.*

*‚Ä¢ Define measures for increased public health and wellness indicators by 12/31/2026.*¬†



All lofty stuff. But also a lot of staff time to create never to be read and unimplementable documents.¬† Here is my revised strategic plan.



*‚Ä¢ Provide police and fire to maintain public safety.*

*‚Ä¢ Maintain Roads, Utilities and Parks.*

*‚Ä¢ Extend Water, Sewer, Power to West PA and the west UGA so that these properties can be developed and thus increase the tax base.*¬†

The City Manager and some Council members say they want to avoid staff cuts, admirable, if staffing hadn‚Äôt ballooned in the first place. Since 2021, the workforce has grown by roughly 50 full-time employees. That‚Äôs a massive expansion for a city our size.

If the City had exercised restraint earlier, we wouldn‚Äôt be facing tough choices now. Instead of hiking rates or draining reserves, we should sharpen our pencils and look for real efficiencies. Government should live within its means, just like its citizens do.¬† It‚Äôs time to trim the fat.

Our housing program duplicates what the county already does and is quite frankly inferior. Let‚Äôs end the overlap, sell the city-owned property at 10th and C Street, and let the market decide its fate. That one step alone would reduce staff and free resources for actual city priorities.



Do we really need a Natural Resource Director in a city of less than 11 square miles? We have real environmental hazards here in our overgrown creek canyons and bluffs, along with derelict properties. We‚Äôd be better served cleaning up those risks instead of arguing with volunteers who want to trim trees on the Front Street overlook. The Tree Program is another ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù luxury. If you want a tree, plant one, but taxpayers shouldn‚Äôt foot the bill.



The city is also pursuing a full rezone, why? Nothing is being built that justifies it. Let‚Äôs simplify: one zone for residential, one for commercial, one for industrial. Simple, predictable, and easier for builders and city planners to navigate.



And do we really need an Assistant City Manager? Over half the city‚Äôs workforce already reports to the Director of Public Works and Utilities. According to the org chart, the assistant oversees Housing (redundant), Long-Range Planning (outsourced), Permitting (our biggest source of complaints), and IT (which could easily move under Finance). That‚Äôs bureaucracy for bureaucracy‚Äôs sake.



Even basic operations can be streamlined. Move to every-other-month utility billing and meter reading. Go paperless wherever possible. These are small steps that add up to real savings without touching essential services.



Let‚Äôs focus on economic responsibility. Port Angeles doesn‚Äôt need prestige; it needs prudence. A truly distinguished budget is one that lives within its means.

1olr9qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadasmallbusiness/comments/1olr9qo/talking_to_customers_for_product_feedback_small/,Talking to Customers for Product Feedback - Small Businesses,"I am building a product for small businesses who sell products/services through their own website/online store - essentially, anyone using Shopify, Etsy, Wix, Squareup, WooCommerce, etc. or even a custom site.

The product captures lost sales, converts new customers, helps determine pricing *(for new/existing products or services)* and helps plan promotions.

It is industry agnostic and pricing/promotion aspect can extend to B&M stores.

I want to ask you some questions - your answers will shape MVP features. It is basically market research to ensure that our MVP solves your problems and in exchange for 30-mins of your time, I will offer free access to the tool at launch.

We can talk over zoom or, if you're in/around Toronto, I'd love to buy you coffee in exchange for your time and feedback.

I will DM with more details to anyone who would be kind enough to offer their time - the more, the better.

Laundry for me is so overwhelming and it takes 2 days to get 1 load done. So here's my solution- put it in washer, stay in the laundry room and read, do yoga, something productive. Until the washer is done, then switch to dryer. Wait until its done. Then put away. When I walk away, it completely leaves my mind. So need to do one thing at a time, and focus on one thing. Or nothing gets done. Bingo. I make lists, but lose them, or forget where I put them. So i need a big board to write everything down, every day. And put it somewhere i will see it. Like maybe above the coffee machine so I know I will see it :)

1olr7lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1olr7lr/at_my_wits_end_feeling_second_to_my_husbands/,At my wits end- Feeling second to my husband‚Äôs video games,"I (30 F) have been married to my husband (29 M) for about a year now but we‚Äôve been together 6.  I am having an extremely hard time with his video game time he‚Äôs putting in the past 5 or so months. 

For context: We both started new jobs in May- he is a WFH salesman & I am a nurse working 6am-4:30pm. Generally leave the house at 5:30am and get home around 5:30pm-6pm. Or later if I go to the gym. 

I do all of the grocery shopping and meal planning. He does the bare minimum chore wise when he‚Äôs home unless I text during my shift and ask. He plays video games (with his friends and brother) in between meetings and sometimes has had them going during meetings (sans friends). I know this because I am off one full day a week and witness it. 

When I get home from work, he‚Äôs playing video games. When I go to bed (which is earlier than him) he wants to stay up and play video games. I go to bed alone more often than not. We‚Äôve had this discussion and he says it‚Äôs how he decompresses after the workday and how he isn‚Äôt tired when I‚Äôm tired. 

Last night/this morning is what has pushed me to post about it and seek help. It was Friday/Halloween and the plan was to watch a movie and hand out candy. I came home from work- he was playing video games- I made dinner (still playing) and he came to eat and turned on a sports game. I said oh what about our Halloween movie? He then proceeded to get pissed off that we couldn‚Äôt pick a movie quickly and told me ‚Äúto just play one‚Äù. Movie finished- whatever. 

I asked him to come to bed w me after- he wanted to play video games. It was a Friday night. He said we could walk in the morning and get coffee. I went to bed alone. Woke up earlier than him- waiting downstairs having a cup of coffee. He finally comes down and says he is going to do the dishes and he‚Äôs going to ‚Äútalk to his brother‚Äù and proceeds to play video games with his brother and friends. I put my walking clothes on, popped my head in his office and told him I was going to walk to get coffee. Walked for an hour. Came back- still playing. Dishes not done. It‚Äôs been another hour and he‚Äôs still playing. We also have company coming next week and our plan is to clean the house today. He‚Äôs well aware of that. 

I can‚Äôt stand it anymore and don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to tell him he can‚Äôt play completely. But I‚Äôm also really pissed off about the lack of quality time spent with me. Is it too much to ask my husband to want to spend a Saturday morning with his wife over video games?!?!? PLEASE HELP!!! 


EDIT: he did tell me he was going to stop playing at 12 and start helping to clean and he did. He‚Äôs not a bad guy I just can‚Äôt stand the video games. ",2,1762012213.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False

Context: Sorry for the bad grammar but here you go:

There is this one guy that I'm friends with for like 2 to 3 years. I started to develop feelings for him a few months ago. He is very far from my type and throughout our friendship, I only see him as a friend. But recently I started devloping feelings for him. Back in 2023, there was this one random time when we were only friends for a few months, and we were together with our friends. He was sitting together with our friends on a table, and I standing in fron of him while I was talking to my friend. He randomly kissed my cheeks out of nowhere. It was just random. No one dared him to do that as if it was his own will to kiss my cheeks. I took it as a joke. He didn't do it once, but three times, in front of my friends. I never really mind it that much and I took it as a joke and acted as if nothing happened and continued to talk with my friend. Take note that we were not really close friends that time since we were only statted being friends for a few months. 
Then he would only chat me sometimes and only asks me questions on school related stuffs or when he ask favors me to send him notes, or copies or something school related. 
Then fast forward, year 2024, I started became closer with him. We were grouped in a small group. We were groupmates for the qhole year, and everytime we have our small group, we would often sit together and gossip. We would always laugh together, then he would draw on my arms, and he would always put his hands around my shoulder. Also, during this year, I also started giving him more favor. He would always ask me to go to the restroom together and I would always be like ""sure'. We were like this almost every day and our bond became more stronger. We never really got to hang out together outside school, but there are some times thay he ask me to hangout with him on McDonald's or wherever, but I couldn't join him since I already have plans with my friends. We rarely take pictures but we were close. 
Then fast forward year 2025. My friends started to became friends with him, in which I also became more closer to him but our bond started to grow closer. There was this time few months ago when we had a 2 days off campus activity. We were grouped together and I was overjoyed. We sat together and I was excited. This is where I started devloping feelings for him. During lectures, I would wrap around my arms on him and I feel like I wanna hug or kiss him. Every time I stop wrapping around my hands on him, he would lift up my arms and wrap it back on his shoulder. He would then lay down on me and he enjoys it. Surprisingly, when he did this, I started getting hard. I don't know if it's just the airconditioner or if I'm just really likes this when I'm intimate with guys. But yeah, he did this several times and it's so difficult to tone down my hardness. Then, we would always get coffee together, get lunch together, eat lunch together, go to the restroom together, and rest together throughout the off campus. There was even a time when everybody was like standing and roaming around during our break, and we were just there sitting beside together and talking together as if we have our own world. I kinda had a thought or feeling that he likes me. But I was still confuse at this time if I have a crush on him or not. Also, on the last day, we had this game where we we were divided into groups and I was grouped with him again. In this game, we were supposed to cross together as a group through the barriers of chairs while a ribbon is tied up together as a group and the challenge is that when one member falls down, the whole group should start all over again. During this time, he held my hands. I didn't hold back and we were just holding hands. There was no instructions of holding hands but we just did. Others were just focusing on themselves trying to cross the barriers of chair, but we were just holding our hands tightly. Even after we have reached the finished line, we were still holding hands. We only let go when the game finished. When I went home, I tried prossessing everythinf and I concluded thay I like him. Then time passes by and we still continue to become intimate. I mean that's what would guy friends do, like wrapping arms around each others shoulder, fooling around, and yeah. We still continue to hold hands together thoigh. I mean he always ask me to crack his finger and we would end up holding hands together. The most recent time we held hands together was last week. It was surprising because we were holding hands, then he went to grab something, and surprisingly took my hands and we held hands togethee again like a couple. I am very confused if he liked me or not because I would sometimes ask him who was his crush and his response were always that ""you will know soon"", ""I'll tell tou next time"", ""I will tell you once we graduate"", ""I don't have a crush"". But I asked my friends about his crush and they said that she likes my girl bestfriend. I'm not sire if my friends are just joking because they do not take these kinds of questions seriously. I mean he had crushes with my other girl bestfriends before but I don't know if those were just rumours and I never reallt asked him about thay. I was a little hurt about the fact thay he didn't tell me about his crush but yeah whatever. Actually I came out to him just this year and he wasn't bothered about the fact that I'm into guys. We were just like normal friends and he would always tease me with my other crushes and my ex crushes. Then we also have a TikTok streaks together. He would always send videos about him not having a chance with his ""crush"", relapse, reality check, and many more about relationship. As I watch rhose videos, it would always say ""she"" or ""her"" which lead me to think that he does not like me at all and she seems to point out my girl bestfriend. But I'm still confused though because it seems like him and my friends are plotting somethinf about me but I just couldn't prove it. He's such a nice guy and friendly and he's always positive which made me like him. My type is usually a chinese guy ot a korean guy who is older and taller than me and rich and famous too. But this guy is totally the opposite of my type and it is very surprising thay I grew feelings for him. But I don't know if he actually ""likes"" me or not or if maybe I'm just overthinking and giving meanings?",2,1762011791.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

1olqveb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1olqveb,Excellence Coral Playa Mujeres Full Review,"Fasten your seat belts, here's a full review of ECPM for those considering a stay here. 

My stay was from 10/25 - 10/30. Couldn't stay for the day of the dead festivities though I'd recommend if you can plan your trip around that time.

Rooms:
I stayed in an EC Jr. Suite with private pool. Pool is massive compared to the plunge pools, which are more like oversized hot tubs. Bed and pillows comfortable, they have a panel to manage temp and lighting in your room. US outlets and USB ports at each nightstand. 
- Pros: located near the golf course, which is a pro for me bc I don't mind having a tropical view and prefer a room tucked away rather than having other guests constantly walking by. I also like that it's ground floor. Easy walk to pools, dining and beach.
- Cons: while private, landscaping hasn't grown in, and neighbors can see your pool. If you want total privacy, get a 2-story. Having the pool and the location also meant more mosquitos. You have been warned.

Club Lounge: lounge was gorgeous. Magna restaurant located inside the lounge. Staff was prompt to serve and very friendly. Nice little assortment of snacks while you waited for check in.
- Pros: I'm a fan of club level.
- Cons: during my stay, Magna was only open for breakfast one day during my stay. Bar un club lounge doesn't open until 3pm.

Dining: all of the food was decent. Tuesday seemed to habe the lowest quality in terms of food and service, but it was pretty dead on property that day.
- Tipico: chicken flaunts were amazing. Quick snacks and fast service
- Chez Isabelle: best experience overall. 
- lobster house: skip the carrot cake and get the blueberry tart for dessert. Otherwise, all good.
- Agave: you choose one menu and receive all courses. This was the staff's favorite place because it's authentic Mexican, not Tex-mex. Whatever has the molcajete on the menu was my favorite of the menus. I was with a group so we family-styled all of them.
- Kitchen Table: I don't love buffets, though happy they will make fresh eggs Benedict for you. Great service
- Las Olas: right om the beach, had lunch here. Nothing memorable but I can't complain. Oh, the chicken wings were so-so. 
- The Grill: I'm a mid-rare girl, steak was under done but I don't mind rare. Filet at Chez Isabelle was much better. Great view of the main pool at night from the patio.
- X-Lounge: didn't try the sushi, had a few drinks here and they were fine
- Aroma: grab and go bakery and coffee shop. Black Forest Cherry coffee was good
- Room Service: consistently delivered between 35-45 minutes. Food was consistently good as well.

Bars: beach bar was fine. X-Lounge bar was good. I don't do a lot at night, so can't say much. Selection of tequilas seemed not great, Jose Cuervo was their top-shelf. Get a Cadillac marg to balance the tequila. I prefer rum, and they had bacardi anejo everywhere. My drinks were just fine, others in the group didn't like any of their drinks. Specify the liquor you want in your drink when ordering and tips help, too.

Beach: white sand, few shells, little seaweed really only in the ocean. Service staff in both club and regular beaches. Resort was low occupancy, so plenty of chairs

Pools: X-Lounge pool is a nice infinity pool over looking the main pool and ocean. Got to spectate some pool volleyball with others a la Statler and Waldorf. The ladders in the pool regardless of your size feel like they will rip off from the floor, really boost your self-confidence...
Didn't spend much time in other club pools or main pool. Hot tubs are located around the main pool. Loved the chaise loungers in the water.

Staff that stood out: Betsy (pictured). Saw her at X-Lounge and Tipico. Super friendly, fast, great drinks. Find her and treat her well.

Wedding venues: their Gazebo is different from their other properties' gazebos, which was cool to see. 

Groups Department: I was hosting a small event here and group. Daniela was very friendly, quick to finalize details, communicated clearly. I own a travel agency and plan groups/weddings, will happily work with her again.

Overall: I would go again. I would definitely host a group event here, any sort of group can work. It's not as bougie and instagram-y as Atelier, and not as laid-back as other properties. It's the perfect in-between in terms of vibe: not too much party, not too boring or quiet.",9,1762011405.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,0.91,False

Starts off with a vanilla thats slight warm upon touch and has a spicy yet boozy type vibe. In the notes one sees a mix of syrup and rum, this does give the thickness on skin and the touch of vanilla, coffee, sandalwood does make the overall smell very appealing and unisex. This Frag does remind me of a mix of many other profiles but all in good.

I saw a matcha shop and decided to order (my dad also ordered a latte but he‚Äôs fine). I ordered a matcha with oat milk since I‚Äôm lactose intolerant. After I finished drinking my iced matcha, I started having stomach aches. I went back to the shop and checked with them if they accidentally used full milk but they assured me that it was oat milk. It felt like acid so I took tums when I got home hoping it would go away. I had dinner but every time I eat my stomach would hurt and I keep burping. Throughout the night it would just keep hurting and it‚Äôs a burning sensation underneath my ribs. I didn‚Äôt sleep well the whole night and I woke up at 4am this morning hoping the pain subsided but the burning‚Äôs still there. I‚Äôve had acid reflux before but not often and they would usually go away after a day but today it‚Äôs still the same. I would keep burping and a yellow bile would come up and I would go to the toilet and spit it out.

1olqt4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1olqt4q/breaking_into_a_category_that_didnt_exist_the/,Breaking into a Category That Didn‚Äôt Exist. The lessons learned from starting Rotation - a coffee subscription / a la carte startup.,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ

It‚Äôs been a wild ride, folks. 6 months have flown by! And we‚Äôre almost here on our last drop 2 drops (nov/december)

When I started this, I came in hot. No playbook, no blueprint, just pure caffeine and conviction. I truly believed I could redefine how people experience coffee. Not just another subscription, but a new category altogether, something that lived beyond Facebook groups and local bean swap meetups.

At first, it was fun. I was fueled by some solid BOP beans and a healthy dose of internet chaos. The coffee snobs, Q graders, and self-proclaimed experts? They hated it. Which, honestly, made it even better. Rage baiting people who built their identity around ‚Äúindustry standards‚Äù became a sport. But behind all that trolling and laughing, I was hand packing over 3,000 doses per drop, and across everything, probably 20,000+.

Then I decided to get serious. I started contract manufacturing my own tubes. Went full mad industry titan. I sourced materials, designed packaging, to create something totally my own. The dream was big, but the demand wasn‚Äôt quite there yet. I basically sprinted past the starting line before the race had even started. 

Ambition 10 out of 10. 
Timing 3 out of 10. üò≠

As things grew, so did the chaos. Working with roasters to pre pack 50 gram samples sounded simple, but it was a logistical nightmare. Not their fault but not built in their workflow.

When I did everything myself, it was exhausting but predictable. Easy to push things out in a timely manner. Once third party logistics entered the picture, costs exploded. Shipping I thought would be around four to five dollars per order jumped to eight. Multiply that by hundreds of subscribers, and boom, I was paying to send you coffee. Literally. Death by a thousand cuts, one USPS label at a time.

And just when things were starting to stabilize‚Ä¶ Reddit banned Rotation. Yep. Blocked from the biggest coffee communities like r/pourover and r/espresso, the exact places where people actually talk about coffee. Imagine running a restaurant and being told you‚Äôre not allowed near Yelp. That‚Äôs what it felt like.

Despite all that, I wouldn‚Äôt trade the experience. Building something that‚Äôs never existed before comes with hits you don‚Äôt see coming. My early na√Øvet√© helped me jump in without fear, but it also made me blind to the tiny details that matter most. The founder‚Äôs pack was too generous. We were giving out too much between the next level brewer, deep 27, filters etc etc. Margins were paper thin. I moved too fast in some areas and too slow in others. But every mistake came from the same place, a refusal to play small.

Looking forward, it‚Äôs clear what needs to change. Prices need fine tuning, operations need tightening, and systems need to scale without me personally hand packing thousands of bags. Asking roasters to pre pack limits creativity, but having in house production opens endless possibilities if demand catches up. I‚Äôm not chasing massive profits, but I do need to stop bleeding on the spreadsheet. I was trying to get to a scale where I can build the perfect ecosystem.

Subs get the community up, the money can pay for staff and roaster, start little co op to help others roast and have ultimate distribution to sample immediately to a larger group of potential buyers through subscription. In my mind still it‚Äôs the best use, to build
It within.

Rotation isn‚Äôt NOT a coffee company. 
It‚Äôs an experimental platform in curiosity, connection, and discovery. Building something that‚Äôs never existed online before means you‚Äôre alone for a while. You take the bruises, you learn fast, and you keep showing up.

Because if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this. When you‚Äôre breaking into a new category, failure isn‚Äôt a setback. It‚Äôs the price of discovery.

Would I do it again? 
Absolutely. But maybe with better shipping rates",8,1762011254.0,coffeerotation,3,0.79,False

1olqrku,https://i.redd.it/fgjd7r7sznyf1.jpeg,My thoughts on the Valoura Discovery Set (For Her) üå∏‚úåüèº,"I wanted to share my honest thoughts on the Valoura Discovery Set (For Her). The presentation immediately caught my eye as it comes in a beautiful wooden box that feels elegant and sturdy when opened. Inside, the vials sit perfectly in a soft foam base, and there‚Äôs a printed card that lists every note in detail for each fragrance, which makes exploring them a lot more fun.

One thing that did make me laugh though was the amount of paper shredder inside the box. I opened it with the fan on and it went flying everywhere üò≠ but I get why it‚Äôs there as the vials are glass and need that extra protection.

A detail that genuinely impressed me was the inclusion of six testing strips. I‚Äôve tried a few discovery sets before like Titan and some international ones, but none of them ever added testing strips. It actually made such a difference because I could test each scent one by one without mixing. I even wrote their names on the strips while trying them, which made the whole experience feel more personal and organized.

The For Her set includes:

‚Ä¢ Miss Sin ‚Äì playful, confident, and bold
‚Ä¢ La Belle ‚Äì sweet and feminine with soft vanilla and juicy pear, maybe even a touch of berry
‚Ä¢ Apple of Heaven ‚Äì bright, crisp apple with a fresh sparkle
‚Ä¢ Libere ‚Äì clean, floral, and strong
‚Ä¢ Rouge 40 ‚Äì a sweet amber scent, warm and rich
‚Ä¢ Vanilla 28 ‚Äì creamy vanilla with a cozy feel

Out of all of them, La Belle and Miss Sin stood out the most for me. La Belle feels so wearable and comforting; that mix of vanilla and fruity notes gives it a soft, elegant vibe. The projection was decent and it lasted well through the day. Miss Sin, on the other hand, has this bold, flirty energy that makes it perfect for evenings.

Rouge 40 wasn‚Äôt really my type, but I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs a beautiful blend. It‚Äôs sweet and ambery, smooth from start to finish, just a little stronger than what I usually prefer.

Performance wise, Miss Sin and Libere lasted around 7+ hours indoors and much longer on clothes. I could still smell Miss Sin on my clothes the next day, which honestly surprised me. Each fragrance opens cleanly and transitions beautifully without any harsh or chemical edges.

The bottles are simple but classy, and the sprayer feels firm and consistent. The overall presentation gives off a thoughtful and well finished feel.

I also have the For Him Discovery Set, and I‚Äôll probably share my thoughts on that separately once I‚Äôve gone through them properly. For now, I can say the For Her collection left a really good impression, elegant presentation, well blended scents, and a lot of care put into the little details.",1,1762011149.0,perfumetalks,0,1.0,False

Just ""be confident"" and ""be yourself""? That‚Äôs the advice your uncle gives while on his third divorce. On TikTok and IG, you‚Äôve got self-declared ""dating coaches"" giving viral tips that are either creepy, scripted, or designed to sell a product. But nothing tells you *how* to be normal when your brain goes offline the second someone attractive smiles at you.

The truth is, most people were never taught this. It wasn‚Äôt in school. Your parents probably didn‚Äôt model it well. But social skills, especially talking to women, can be learned. It‚Äôs not about memorizing lines. It‚Äôs about learning social calibration, reading cues, and not making it weird.

This post is a practical guide to actually getting better at talking to women. No gimmicks. Just real insights pulled from social science, psych research, and a decade of trial and error. If you‚Äôve ever panicked mid-sentence or over-thought a text for 45 minutes, this is for you.

Here‚Äôs what matters and what actually works:

- Most people aren‚Äôt judging you as harshly as you think. According to the ‚Äúliking gap‚Äù research published in *Psychological Science* (2018), people consistently underestimate how much others like them after a conversation. You‚Äôre likely doing better than you think. This helps reduce that overthinking spiral of ‚ÄúDid I sound creepy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWas I awkward?‚Äù

- Don‚Äôt over-optimize the first line. The opener doesn‚Äôt matter as much as the vibe. Harvard psychologist Dr. Amy Cuddy talks about how people judge new interactions based first on warmth, *then* competence. So say anything neutral and context-based: ‚ÄúThat book‚Äôs intense, huh?‚Äù at a bookstore. ‚ÄúThis line is brutal‚Äù at a coffee shop. The content is background. It‚Äôs your tone and body language that tell the real story.

- Match her energy, don‚Äôt overpower it. A 2021 study from *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* showed mutual mirroring in tone, pacing, and word choice increases connection. If she‚Äôs chill, don‚Äôt come in like a hype man. If she‚Äôs energetic, don‚Äôt act like a wall. Tune your energy to hers. That‚Äôs called ‚Äúcalibration‚Äù and it‚Äôs the difference between charming and weird.

- Learn how to exit gracefully. One of the most underrated skills. If you sense she‚Äôs not engaged or open, don‚Äôt dig in. Say ‚ÄúHey, no worries, I‚Äôll leave you to it. Have a great day.‚Äù Then walk. Respect is attractive. And you‚Äôll be surprised how often that confidence flips the interaction. No one likes someone who lingers out of desperation.

- Get good at *not trying too hard*. Dr. Aziz Gazipura, in his book *Not Nice*, talks about how approval-seeking behavior (over-agreeing, over-explaining, forcing humor) kills authenticity. Conversation should feel like a mutual exchange, not a performance. Say what you actually think. If you disagree, say it kindly. That creates real presence.

- Stop thinking of it as ‚Äútalking to women.‚Äù Talk to *people*. If you only practice social skills when it‚Äôs someone you‚Äôre attracted to, the stakes will always be too high. Talk to baristas, cashiers, elderly people at the park. Build the muscle until it‚Äôs second nature. That‚Äôs how you desensitize your anxiety.

- Avoid complimenting physical appearance right away. Especially if it's the only thing you're focusing on. A 2010 paper published in *Psychology of Women Quarterly* found that appearance-based compliments from strangers often made women feel objectified rather than flattered. Compliment presence, vibe, or something they *chose*: ‚ÄúYou have great taste in music‚Äù goes way farther than ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so hot.‚Äù

- Pay attention to nonverbal cues. If she‚Äôs giving one-word answers, turned away, or not asking questions back, that‚Äôs a soft no. Don‚Äôt push. But if she‚Äôs engaged, laughing, and asking *you* questions, that‚Äôs a green light. Social scientist Vanessa Van Edwards calls this ‚Äúconversational reciprocity,‚Äù and it‚Äôs the #1 thing to watch for.

- Learn how to tell a story. You don‚Äôt need to be hilarious. But storytelling builds connection. Use the simple ‚Äúsituation ‚Äì conflict ‚Äì resolution ‚Äì takeaway‚Äù format. It keeps things interesting. Podcasts like *The Moth* are good training for this. Just don‚Äôt dominate the convo with your life story. Keep it 70/30, you talk 70 if she‚Äôs shy, 30 if she‚Äôs talkative.

- Don‚Äôt text like a robot. Use voice notes or playful punctuation to show tone. A 2022 report from Hinge Labs found that sending voice messages increased reply rates by 72%. People want to hear a real human, not a ChatGPT-generated message. If texting feels weird, move to a call or meet sooner. Real connection doesn‚Äôt happen in DMs.

- Practice in low-stakes environments. Don't wait until you're at a bar with a major crush. Start with neutral social interactions. Meetup groups, community events, group classes. These are safe, built-in ways to practice non-awkward conversations. Reps matter. You can read forever but your brain needs real-time data.

- Don‚Äôt rush or fake confidence. That‚Äôs not what most people find attractive. Psychologist Dr. Laurie Helgoe‚Äôs research on introversion shows that quiet confidence often builds more trust than flashy charisma. Speak a little slower. Pause before answering. That calm presence makes you feel grounded and trustworthy.

- Rejection isn‚Äôt failure. It‚Äôs feedback. And it‚Äôs data. The most socially skilled people aren‚Äôt the ones who never get rejected. They‚Äôre the ones who don‚Äôt take it personally. If someone isn‚Äôt into you, it just means the connection wasn‚Äôt mutual. That‚Äôs normal. You‚Äôre not for everyone. No one is.

- Get your internal dialogue right. If your self-talk is ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs too hot for me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna mess this up,‚Äù you‚Äôre creating tension before it starts. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) practices show that reframing thoughts like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just see what happens‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis is just a convo‚Äù lowers anxiety and boosts performance. Try it. Your mind listens to your words.

Most importantly, remember this: attraction isn‚Äôt some mystical thing. It‚Äôs a mix of safety, curiosity, humor, timing, and presence. You don‚Äôt need to be rich or ripped or ridiculously smooth. You just need to be someone who listens, respects boundaries, and can hold a real conversation without making it weird.

Looking at today and the future I scratch my head more and more at this idea. His favorite places, Silicon Valley and New York City, seem to just repeat their same playbook over and over based on past successes. It's all about being durable capital and labor light, monopolizing the idea / design / patent then outsource the actual building of it, and blitzscaling to be the first one to the top of the hill to claim monopoly status. That produced a crap ton of money the last 40 years.

But now we're increasingly seeing money chase stupid ideas: Metaverse, Sora 2, Chat GPT5, things like that. We've completely faceplanted on the EV train that Elon started and decided ICE hybrid engines are what we'll just get. We haven't had ANY successes come from Silicon Valley and the US auto industry collaborating. We're seeing serious overlooks where not sinking $$ to actually produce things is a giant vulnerability.

I think he's wrong. I think if we dropped the people with power and money into some random coffee shop in like Farmington NM and water coolered there they might ACTUALLY come up with better ideas.

The conclusion I get is that a bunch of people all in 'proximity' just yields positive feedback thought loops, tribal thought so to speak. If the mantra is right it's wildly successful, if it's wrong it spirals out dangerously. Like if we had EVERY auto maker in the world in Detroit in 1970 and they all water coolered, they would have ALL made the same mistakes.",1,1762010960.0,SeriousConversation,4,1.0,False
1olqonc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1olqonc,Mom was finally discharged from Neuro ICU to the rehab center yesterday afternoon! These were her last meals on there.,"If any of these are repeats from previous Neuro ICU posts, I apologize. I'm just fried. 

1) She was able to eat the chicken parm after scraping the breading off, as well as the green beans and protein shake, but I went downstairs to get her something to make up for the pasta.

2) Which is this. Chicken, salmon, and some really good vegetables. I bought enough to where I could take the remainder home for myself after she was done. We both enjoyed it. 8/10. For a hospital, 13/10.

3) Chicken breast, mac and cheese, and broccolini. The mac and cheese resulted in her being put back on the insulin drip. This was taken before the chicken parm/pasta meal which I replaced with a mostly protein and some fat lunch. She couldn't leave the ICU until they got her off the insulin drip. 

4) Beef stew and vegetables. After that and the protein shake, she wasn't really hungry for the potatoes, fortunately. 

5) I've been living on the hospital cafe's 'Shot in the Dark' coffees this whole 19 days. It's drip coffee with a shot of espresso plus cream. 5% of my bloodstream is probably coffee at this point, lol

6) Me. The face of a burnt out caregiver who's been at this for well over a year. 

I honestly don't think the rehab is a good idea yet, but I have no say... she is so cognitively compromised that she can't follow basic instructions and fights us any time we even try to stand her up to move from the chair to the bed. She'll definitely have to repeat the rehab after she has her shunt put in. Godspeed, mama. ",28,1762010958.0,hospitalfood,13,1.0,False

If you're like me and you've ever cursed at a sluggish Gulp build while trying to spin up a custom theme, pull up a chair. I just dropped WP Rig v3.1, and holy cow, it feels like we've finally caught up to the JS world. No more waiting around for compiles that take longer than my coffee break ‚Äì we're talking **2x faster builds** out of the box, with a watch process that's so snappy it's basically HMR for WordPress. (What a time to be alive, right? üòé)

I've been heads-down tweaking this open-source starter kit because, let's be real, theme development shouldn't feel like wrestling a dinosaur. WP Rig's always been about keeping things lightweight and dev-friendly, but v3.1? It's next-level. Here's the juicy stuff:

* **Ditched Gulp for Custom Node Magic:** Swapped out that old beast for lean scripts that crank through JS/CSS in half the time. Pair it with Bun (faster than npm, hands down ‚Äì you'll be amazed by the blazing speed), and your installs are done before you can say ""dependency hell.""
* **Image Processing on Steroids:** Hello, Sharp! Goodbye, clunky Imagemin. Now it auto-converts to WebP, runs lightning-fast, and doesn't bog down your dev server. Perfect for those asset-heavy sites.
* **CLI Wizards for Everyday Wins:**
   * Generate PHP components in seconds ‚Äì scaffolds everything in /inc and hooks it into your theme.php. No more boilerplate burnout.
   * **Child themes? Presto!** One command flips your Rig into a full child setup, stripping parent-only bits and firing up builds for *any* theme (even premium ones). Game over for manual tweaks.
   * Local fonts FTW: Scans your Google Fonts, downloads 'em to /assets/fonts, and spits out the CSS. Ditch the CDN roulette for better perf and privacy.
   * Block theme conversion: Zap your universal theme into a block-based beast, complete with theme.json ‚Äì Customizer and menus? See ya.
   * And for block lovers: Built-in tools to create/register Gutenberg blocks right in your theme (powered by @wordpress/create-block). Export to plugins if you want, or keep 'em cozy.

This isn't just fluff ‚Äì it's all about shaving hours off your workflow so you can focus on the fun stuff, like crafting killer designs or debugging that one weird edge case. I've already used the child command on a client project, and it saved me a solid afternoon.

WP Rig's free, MIT-licensed, and 100% community-driven ‚Äì if you've got ideas or PRs, hit me up on GitHub. Grab it here: [wprig.io](https://wprig.io) or straight from the repo.

Devs, what's your biggest pain point with theme setups right now? Gulp refugees, have you tried Bun yet? Drop your thoughts below ‚Äì let's chat and maybe collab on the next feature. üöÄ

Cheers,

Witnesses tell Page Six that the Kiss of the Spider Woman star rolled up to Hampton Coffee Company just after 8:00 a.m., dressed in a cream turtleneck, oversized sunglasses, and what one observer described as ‚Äúthe energy of someone expecting applause.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe told the barista she was there for a ‚Äòsoul reset Saturday,‚Äô‚Äù said one patron. ‚ÄúThen she asked which table had the best natural light. Nobody answered, so she just sat by the window and started staging her own candid photos.‚Äù

But as Lopez adjusted her scarf and whispered affirmations into her oat milk latte, the calm morning air was suddenly sliced open by the sound of laughter and sequins.

In through the door swept Bianca Del Rio ‚Äî in full sequin drag, shimmering like divine karmic retribution under the caf√©‚Äôs soft Edison bulbs. Flanking her once again were Natasha Ramos and Ashanti, both radiant and relaxed, embodying the effortless ease Lopez had been straining to project.

The trio, it turned out, had just happened to be on a break from filming nearby, which made their perfectly timed entrance all the more surreal ‚Äî as if the universe itself had scheduled the encounter for maximum humiliation.

‚ÄúEveryone turned to look,‚Äù said a witness. ‚ÄúBianca was sparkling like a disco ball that had opinions.‚Äù

In a panic, Lopez tried to gather her composure ‚Äî but in the process, she dropped her rhinestone-encrusted Delola tumbler, sending glittering stones skittering across the hardwood floor.

‚ÄúThe sound was like her dignity shattering in Dolby surround,‚Äù whispered one bystander.

As the rhinestones rolled under tables and into lattes, Bianca stopped mid-step, surveyed the chaos, and delivered the line that froze the entire caf√©:

> ‚ÄúSweetheart, even the seagulls aren‚Äôt screaming for you today.‚Äù



Lopez reportedly froze, smiled too long, then whispered something about ‚Äúvibrational interference‚Äù before slipping out the back door to her SUV, rhinestones still twinkling in her wake.

Meanwhile, Bianca ordered her usual ham and cheese on a roll and a double espresso, adding, ‚ÄúMake it to go ‚Äî fame fatigue is contagious.‚Äù

I‚Äôm 25M, been living in Bangalore for about a year now. I‚Äôve got some really close friends, mostly from school, but they‚Äôre all scattered across the world. In this one year here, I haven‚Äôt really made any new friends, and honestly, it‚Äôs starting to bother me a bit.

I work as a dev, mostly from home (Going to office like once a week maybe). I try to go to the gym or the office sometimes, but everyone there always seems super busy or already has their own circle. 

At work, whenever people do meet up, all the conversations somehow circle back to work. Bitching about someone, someone's manager, deadlines, AWS and that's okay sometimes but it gets annoying when that's all the talk that is there.

I really want to make friends outside of work, people from different fields, walks of life, whatever. A lawyer, a doctor doesn‚Äôt matter. Just people I can connect with beyond work.

Also, I don‚Äôt drink or smoke which I‚Äôve realized makes excellent social lubricants.  Since I don‚Äôt drink, I sometimes feel left out of that ‚Äúvulnerability zone‚Äù people hit after a few beers or the constant nag about ""hey you should drink or try this one I'm sure you'll like it"".

In the world of high fashion, the office isn't just a workspace - it's the ultimate aesthetic statement. So, it's no surprise that the new Jacquemus headquarters in Paris, unveiled in 2023, is not only functional but also breathtakingly chic. This is a perfectly curated, art-filled testament to the brand's unique energy.

Designed by the renowned firm OMA in collaboration with UNISPACE, the headquarters, located in the 8th arrondissement, immediately greets you with an open, airy vibe.

The space perfectly embodies founder Simon Porte Jacquemus‚Äôs signature aesthetic: soft, minimalist curves, arched surfaces, and a soothing palette of delicate, sunny tones. It‚Äôs a masterful blend of modern minimalism and timeless elegance, bringing the dreamy, sun-drenched energy of the South of France right into the heart of the capital.

The multi-functional layout offers a glimpse into the team's daily life, featuring dedicated couture workshop areas, sleek offices, meeting rooms, and a French-inspired terrace for those relaxed yet sophisticated vibes.

The commitment to art here is absolute. The office is personally curated by Simon Jacquemus himself, featuring stunning works that elevate the space from functional workplace to cultural destination.

The decor pushes boundaries, combining soft, asymmetrical arches with elements of surrealist warmth - think custom coffee stations and cozy conversation pits - all designed to foster creativity and collaboration.

Follow this as much as you can:

>**K.I.S.S:** Keep It Simple, Stupid.

Anyways, I recommend these 2 folders at the minimum;

# Auxiliary Workspace

Your main working folder. It contains all your support material‚Äîtools, notes, and plans that help you think and act efficiently.

# 1. Information Toolkit

A folder for quick reference information‚Äîanything you might ‚Äúuse like a tool.‚Äù  
Examples: math formulas, color codes, essay-writing guides, FRE score meanings, etc.

# 2. Phone Numbers

A simple list of important phone numbers.  
Example file: [`emergency-numbers.md`](http://emergency-numbers.md)

# 3. Planner

A folder for all notes related to actions, goals, and projects.

**Example notes:**

* **To-Do List:** Write down your daily and personal tasks, organized by priority. Use headings for ‚ÄúReminders‚Äù (things to remember) and ‚ÄúMore‚Äù (extra details about specific tasks). Example: `- [ ] Complete Science Assignment [[#What I exactly have to do for my Science assignment|More]]`
* **Exploration:** Two main sections: *More Interested* and *Less Interested.* Use this note to list topics or rabbit holes you want to explore someday. Example:



    # More Interested
    - [ ] Color Psychology
    - [ ] MBTI and Enneagram
    - [ ] Bioremediation
    
    # Less Interested
    - [ ] Logic
    - [ ] Law
    - [ ] Financial Education

* **Items:** A list of real objects or products you‚Äôd like to get someday‚Äîthings that exist in today‚Äôs world. Example: `- [ ] Build a custom home base`
* **Quests:** Big missions or projects. Example: `- [ ] Increase free time in society`
* **Skills:** A list of skills to learn, divided by interest level. Example:



    # More Interested
    - [ ] Medical & life-saving skills ==Medic==
    - [ ] Masterful communication ==Leader==
    - [ ] Coding/programming ==Developer==
    
    # Less Interested
    - [ ] Illustration ==Illustrator==
    - [ ] Handwriting in Quicksand Font

# Miscellaneous Notes

A second folder for general notes and rough ideas.

# 1. Canvas Notes

Store any temporary notes or experiments from your Canvas workspace here.

# 2. Short-text Notepad

A folder for short, atomic notes.

**Rules:**

* Each idea goes under an H1 heading (`# Heading`).
* Keep entries short enough so you don‚Äôt need to scroll.
* Add `***` as a separator before each heading.
* Notes are stored by year or month. Example filename: [`short-text-2025.md`](http://short-text-2025.md)

**Example entry:**

    ***
    # Guidelines for Writing Notes in Zettelkasten
    1. Atomicity ‚Äì Each note should stand alone.
    2. Specificity ‚Äì Focus on one clear idea.
    3. Originality ‚Äì Write in your own words.
    4. Interconnectedness ‚Äì Link related notes.
    ***
    # Two Questions to Find Your Values
    1. What matters to me?
    2. How can I matter to it?

Use this space for ideas, insights, or facts‚Äîno matter how random they seem.  
It can include anything: design thoughts, philosophy notes, recipes, reflections, or even personal reminders.

# 3. Long-text Notepad

Same rules as the Short-text Notepad, but here you can write as much as you like under each heading. Just don‚Äôt go overboard.

# --------

# My actual original long comment (formatting broken)

Follow this as much as you can:

\> \*\*\*\*K.I.S.S:\*\*\*\* Keep It Simple, Stupid.

Anyways, I recommend these 2 folders at the minimum;

1. I call the folder 'Auxiliary Workspace', it contains...
   * 'Information Toolkit' folder: Contains all kinds of information that I'd \*\*\*\*use like tools.\*\*\*\*

\- - Examples: Math formulas, RGB or HEX color codes, eassy writing guides, FRE score meanings, etc.

\- 'Phone numbers' folder: pretty self explanatory, it's just a place to store all kinds of phone numbers.

\- - Example filename: \[\`emergency-numbers.md\`\]([http://emergency-numbers.md](http://emergency-numbers.md))

\- 'Planner' folder: Contains all kinds of notes that're focused on tasks, missions, and plans.

\- - Example, files that I've in my Planner folder:

\- - 'To-Do List' note: A listing of tasks that you'd to remember and track in your day-to-day life, both work and personal, separated into higher and lower priority using headings and given status tags if helpful. There's also a 'Reminders' and 'More' heading sections in the note, they both work for quickly taking notes of things you'd like to remember; The 'Reminders' is for things you'd like to remember, and the 'More' section is to write additional details on some tasks in your to-do list as to not clutter your to-do list, simply adding a link to the extra details in the to-do item instead, something like: \`- \[ \] Complete Science Assignment \[\[#What I exactly have to do for my Science assignment|More\]\]\`

\- 'Exploration' note: 2 main headings 'Less Interested' and 'More Interested', under each write things with check-boxes that I'm consider to explore, check-out, or look into someday as It seems interesting to me right now. Once I do explore them (someday), I'll check them off and maybe remove them from the list, I may also remove an item from this ""to-explore list"" if I feel that I'm not interested in it anymore and am never gonna focus on or investigate deeper into. You can also think of it as a place to store all kinds of rabbit-holes you plan on going into someday. Example:

\- - # More Interested

\- - \[ \] \[Playful Design / Gamification\]([https://www.gamified.uk/even-ninja-monkeys-like-to-play/](https://www.gamified.uk/even-ninja-monkeys-like-to-play/))

\- - \[ \] Color psychology

\- - \[ \] MBTI and Enneagram

\- - \[ \] Bioremediation

\- - \[ \] \*\*Principles of disaster management\*\* ‚Äî risk assessment, emergency response, & community resilience.

\- ---

\- # Less Interested

\- - \[ \] \[Logic\]([https://youtu.be/JBjAyrX7wms?si=Tag2QoPhzN5PpuDs](https://youtu.be/JBjAyrX7wms?si=Tag2QoPhzN5PpuDs))

\- - ""Understanding logic should be a prerequisite for pretty much any activity that makes a contribution to humanity"" - William Spaniel, Logic 101 (#1): Introduction, YouTube

\- - \[ \] Neovim or Emacs (just for text-editing use?)

\- - \[ \] Law

\- - \[ \] Get financially educated

\- 'Items' note: A list of various \*\*\*\*real\*\*\*\* items or products I someday want to obtain, either with money or other means like making it myself. Could also be something like: \`- \[ \] Obtain a good home base (Custom built?) (In Space?)\` Just make sure the items in the list are something you can get relatively normally in the world as it is right now if you suddenly had infinite money or became a ruler of the world.

\- 'Quests' note: A list of larger scale projects, operations, or missions to take on. Could be something like: \`- \[ \] Increase free-time in society.\`

\- 'Skills' note: This is a list of skills you want to learn or master. Example:

\- - # More Interested

\- - \[ \] \*\*Medical and Essential life-saving skills\*\* ‚Äî First aid & CPR among other things, it'd be nice if I knew how to heal from numerous types of injuries and ailments. ==Medic==

\- - \[ \] Masterful communication ‚Äî Rhetoric, persuasion, listening, etc. ==Leader==

\- - \[ \] Coding/programming ==Developer==

\- - - For being able to be a polymath who can also do computer stuff, e.g., simulations, AI, or data analysis. (Python)

\- - To enjoy/experience writing neat code by making it atomic (Each line should do one clear thing.) and adding comments among other things.

\- - To be able to contribute to CDDA (C++)

\- - \[ \] Prepping / Disaster prepping ==Prepper==

\- \*\*\*

\- # Less Interested

\- - \[ \] Illustration / Sketch-noting ==Illustrator==

\- - \[ \] Handwriting in Quicksand Font

\- - \[ \] Making things from scratch ==Inventor==

3. The second folder is called 'Miscellaneous Notes', it contains...

4. - 'Canvas Notes' folder: A place to store any kind of Canvas notes you make and don't want to delete right now.

\- 'Short-text Notepad' folder: Now this is a very special place, it has a small easy to follow format that you should follow when writing anything in the notes in this folder. The rules are as follows:

\- - Anything you write, any idea, any fact, any rubbish, anything, should be under an H1 heading, i.e., a top level heading, example \`# Heading 1\`. Everything you write here should have a short title, separate ideas into and place them under different headings if you must. Additionally, I add a visual separator, i.e., \`\*\*\*\` on the line before every H1 heading.

\- Whatever you write should not be too long, as a guideline: it should be written short enough that you don't need to scroll at all.

\- Now, in the 'Short-text Notepad' folder, notes should be written in according to the year (or a shorter duration like each month, if you're an insanely crazy overcharged idea generator), example filename: \`short-text-2025\` . In these, go the note of the correct year, and write away anything by following the earlier mentioned rules. Here's how the note may look like:

\- - # Guidelines for writing notes in zettelkasten

\- 1. \*\*Atomicity\*\* ‚Äî Idea should be self-contained and shouldn't need context from outside the note to be understood.

\- 2. \*\*Specificity\*\* ‚Äî It should be focused and specific rather than broad or vague.

\- 3. \*\*Originality\*\* ‚Äî Write ideas in your own words, not just copied text.

\- 4. \*\*Interconnectedness\*\* ‚Äî While each idea is standalone, it should have the potential to connect to other ideas.

\- An idea can be a concept, a fact, a question, an observation, or even a personal insight.

\- In a Zettelkasten, an ""idea"" is a single, discrete unit of information or thought. It's typically concise enough to fit on a single note card or in a short digital note, but complete enough to stand on its own.

\- # Six Pillars of the Wizard lifestyle philosophy

\- 1. Life as Adventure

\- 2. The pursuit of knowledge

\- 3. Creativity and craftmanship

\- 4. Connection with nature

\- 5. Embrace whimsy

\- 6. Practice humility and charisma

\- \*\*\*

\- # Two questions to help find & prioritize your values

\- 1. What matters to me?

\- 2. How can I matter to it?

\- \*\*\*

\- # Truncated octahedron - a potentially interesting 3D shape

\- Truncated octahedron

\- From what I remember. I found it when I was looking for a shape which would be like a 3D equivalent of the hexagon and could tile.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Be a tool master

\- Learn to be a tool master, if you get good at every relevant tool, then you're good enough to do the main job properly & safely. If a person has a job that they intend to do then mastering the tools relevant to the job would almost always make them 'good enough' at it.

\- \*\*\*

\- # A reason and method to track progress

\- Not tracking your work could be the reason behind not feeling motivated and feeling like your not doing enough.

\- I felt significantly more positive and was more productive when I ended up accidently testing this idea as a side-effect when working on tracking and collecting data on study capacity. So, I'm probably onto something important here.

\- The way to do it, as learnt accidentally, is to temporarily track the amount of work done using a unit of progress that's specific and simple but not small enough to cause interruptions to log every less than half a minute (for example: 1 idea paraphrased) for every work session.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Consider the aspect of time

\- Consider how things look across time, not just space.

\- When doing anything in life, it's often useful and/or insightful to consider the aspect of time. Like thinking about how the tools you're using in your activity were in the past or will be in the future, or if thinking or studying about rockets then think about how long it's fuel will last or how it's machines & parts will move from launch to until it lands (or whatever else happens to it) for example.

\- # Systema Fighting style

\- - Taught in Russian Special Forces.

\- - Focuses on fluid movements, breathing control, and using the opponent's energy against them.

\- - Great for flexibility and adaptability in a fight.

\- # Creating a list of super resources

\- - Hemp (Cannabis sativa)

\- - Quartz (maybe? I dunno...)

\- \*\*\*

\- # Learning vs. Studying

\- Learning is accumulation of new useful knowledge.

\- Studying is the act of analyzing, filtering, or refining data & information into knowledge.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Useful expressions in Spanish

\- - No lo s√© - I don't know

\- - Claro que s√≠ - Of course / absolutely / surely / by all means / ""That's so right!"" / ""exactly!""

\- \*\*\*

\- # Capacity of university students

\- After a brief conversation with ChatGPT, I surmise that a university student who's able to normally keep-up just enough, has the following general learning capacity:

\- In a day; Actively learning around 20-50 ideas in 4-6 hours.

\- Another way to put it would be, around 5-8 paragraphs worth of knowledge absorbed per hour, in a day.

\- With that considered; Understanding 35 ideas enough to explain it simply within 5 hours a day is probably a good estimate of how much I should be minimally capable of if I'm ever to be a decent student.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Useful Questions for streamlining

\- - Can you explain what is XYZ in one sentence?

\- - What're the various XYZ?

\- - What's the pragmatic use of XYZ?

\- - If you can only use one of the types of XYZ and not be allowed to use any other type of XYZ, which XYZ should you choose? what alone would provide the most value?

\- - Can you simply identify the main use and function of XYZ? when would someone look for XYZ & why?

\- \*\*\*

\- # Streamlining is finding a stone that can hit more birds

\- Streamlining often comes down to finding that \*\*one stone\*\* you can hit two or more birds with.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Learning one basic useful skill every area

\- Learn the useful basics of everything, inspired from the anime 'I can parry everything'

\- \*\*\*

\- # Salad idea

\- - \*\*Spinach\*\*

\- - \*\*Cucumber\*\*

\- - \*\*Boiled egg\*\* (maybe mashed or sliced up)

\- - \*\*Lettuce\*\*

\- - \*\*Fried potato cubes\*\* (ideally made using one small potato or something and air fried (with minimal olive oil))

\- - Shreds or little \*\*pieces of grilled chicken\*\*

\- It might end up a bit soggy, in which case try either one of the following next time:

\- - Reduce the time between making it and eating it, eat it more immediately, the water from the cucumber is probably the culprit.

\- - Don't add cucumber as an ingredient when making it.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Appreciate ordinary people

\- Don't underestimate the power of a common man. An average Joe or Joella is powerful, you can truly see that especially when you're weak. Appreciate the hard-work of ordinary people.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Things that can help with memorization

\- If you need to memorize something then try looking for mnemonics, analogies, formulas, infographics, or similar..

\- # Increasing intelligence doesn't endlessly increase loneliness

\- The smarter you're than most, the lonelier it gets... but, the smarter you're the more you'll be okay with it.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Judgement happens in silence

\- Judgement perceived or real usually happens in silence, i.e., what's judged usually isn't said. When a person truly judges someone strongly, they're not open to getting corrected or listening to learn out who the person they're judging really is, because they may speak like they've already figured you out. To them, almost all the gaps of what they don't know about someone can be pretty confidently filled using impressions they give them.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Thoughts, ideas, and insights should be collected

\- Is there a thing about or a term for collecting ideas that nobody usually talks about? Like infamous or unheard wisdom, the bits of knowledge not often talked about, or even insights that occur to us on whim or through personal observations. Cuz I think we should do it, I think it has value.

\- \*\*\*

\- # A home

\- Home is a safe haven and a comfort zone. A place to live with our families and pets and enjoy with friends. A place to build memories as well as a way to build future wealth. A place where we can truly just be ourselves. And whether our houses are big, small, fancy or modest, they are our shelters and our sanctuaries.

\- \*\*\*

\- # There are 2 paths when pursuing goals

\- There are 2 paths when pursuing a goal, it is possible to do a bit of both.

\- ## The path of Risk

\- \*""How can I maximize my success?""\*

\- Offensive, charging in at the easiest point of entry.

\- ## The path of Safety

\- \*""How can I minimize my failure?""\*

\- Defensive, making sure nothing bad breaks in.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Sentiment or memories is what makes a gift precious

\- Sentiment or memories is what gives gifts it's value and makes it precious. Good gifts have memories attached to them or they mean something to person receiving it on a personal level.

\- \*\*\*

\- # Convenience is important

\- Convenience is important

\- \*\*\*

\- # Find new terms when writing concisely

\- Remember to ask yourself while writing:\*\* ""Is there something that all this is referred to as? like maybe a simpler terminology for all this?""

\- # Consistency is important for progress

\- Doing a little bit everyday consistently is the key to progress.

\- To do more in the same amount of time, you need higher performance which requires better tools (including your body) & resources.

\- # Application gives an idea it's value

\- The quality & range of application is what decides if an idea is note-worthy.

\- # Dynamic environments

\- Maybe movement in our environments, or simply variety in visuals and sounds that shows liveness is important, very important. Maybe that's why some people prefer to study in coffee shops instead of a cold, quiet, and empty room.

\- Perhaps engaging in watching movement and maybe even moving ourselves is key in feeling alive and fighting boredom.

But... you may not want to go too crazy üòÖ

That's it.

TL;DR: Sorry if you got overwhelmed... there's no TLDR, maybe just check out the main points only? It looks intimidating cuz I went crazy on an example and tried to be as clear as I could on the things I mentioned.

We met at the entrance of a bar, there was chemistry, and I asked for her number. We agreed to go on a date a few days later and it was great ‚Äî we ended up kissing and decided to go out partying. She drank a lot that night (I don‚Äôt drink), and when I walked her home, she wanted to have sex with me on a bench in front of her building. I told her she was too drunk to do anything, and that I refused to have sex in the street. She said she didn‚Äôt want us to go up to her place because she had recently moved in and was embarrassed because of her roommates (we live in a university city, and the semester starts in September). I told her that the first time with her should be more ‚Äúfancy,‚Äù and she smiled, I kissed her, wished her goodnight, and went home.

After that, we had another date planned, but she canceled an hour before, saying that her mom and brother were coming to visit and she‚Äôd be spending the whole week with them. Since it was the first time it happened, I didn‚Äôt think much of it and said, ‚ÄúNo problem, just tell me when they leave and we‚Äôll pick a day that works for both of us.‚Äù So we met the following week, and it went great. She asked me about my past relationships, and I simply said, ‚ÄúI was with three girls a while ago, but hey, are you trying to tie me down already without me even meeting your parents?‚Äù She started laughing and told me she had never had a boyfriend, but she had three situationships, because she needed to find a man who was focused on his studies, close to his parents, and Catholic. (The Catholic thing surprised me since she had tried to have sex with me the first night we met in the street‚Ä¶) Then she told me that she was talking to other guys, and asked if that bothered me. I replied, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve only seen each other twice, why would it bother me?‚Äù At the end of the night, we were in a private place in my car, and when we were making out, I tried to get more intimate with her, but she said she wanted to take things slower with me, that we barely knew each other. So we just kissed and touched a bit. That same night, she suggested going to a really nice place about an hour‚Äôs drive away ‚Äî she even suggested going that Friday. It sounded like a great plan, and I accepted since I had nothing else that day.

Okay, here‚Äôs where things started to go wrong: that very morning she canceled the plan, saying she had completely forgotten she already had plans with her best friend, and asked if we could do it another time. Since it was the second time she canceled last minute, I told her that I valued my time and that it seemed like we weren‚Äôt on the same page. I said that if she wanted us to keep seeing each other, she should suggest something to do and a day to meet. She said she didn‚Äôt expect that response at all and that it ‚Äúsaid a lot.‚Äù Then she said that if I didn‚Äôt want to see her again, she respected my decision. After that, I didn‚Äôt text her again.  
  
However, days went by, and I noticed she still had me in her Instagram close friends, and she started liking my Instagram stories‚Ä¶ After about a week of that, I decided to message her saying, ‚ÄúI thought you didn‚Äôt want to hear from me again after what happened ‚Äî what‚Äôs with the likes?‚Äù She replied that she never said that. She said that the reason she hadn‚Äôt suggested meeting up was because it was the first time a guy had had that kind of ‚Äúattitude‚Äù with her, and she didn‚Äôt know how to react. She said she didn‚Äôt mind seeing me. So I suggested meeting up the following weekend for coffee to talk. We basically had another ‚Äúfirst date,‚Äù and it was great ‚Äî we didn‚Äôt talk about what had happened at all, we laughed a lot, and we kissed again‚Ä¶ But we still haven‚Äôt had sex due to the circumstances I mentioned. After that, I suggested meeting up not the following week, but the week after (because of work), so I have a date with her this Friday.

What do you think about my situation? Am I handling it well?

A few things I should clarify:

* She doesn‚Äôt live in my city ‚Äî she‚Äôs leaving in March to go back to her country.
* She‚Äôs extremely cold over text but very affectionate in person. We usually exchange 3 messages a day.
* I‚Äôm always the one who starts the conversations.",1,1762010259.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Introducci√≥n al mercado de bolsas de caf√© reciclables en China**  
El consumo mundial de caf√© ha aumentado de manera significativa en los √∫ltimos a√±os, impulsando una demanda creciente de empaques que sean funcionales, atractivos y, sobre todo, sostenibles. En este contexto, los fabricantes chinos de bolsas de caf√© reciclables se han posicionado como l√≠deres en la industria del empaque ecol√≥gico. Gracias a su capacidad de producci√≥n avanzada, tecnolog√≠a de punta y precios competitivos, China se ha convertido en un centro estrat√©gico para el suministro global de empaques reciclables. Estas bolsas no solo protegen la frescura y el aroma del caf√©, sino que tambi√©n reflejan un compromiso con la preservaci√≥n del medio ambiente. Las marcas de caf√©, tanto artesanales como comerciales, est√°n adoptando este tipo de empaque para cumplir con las exigencias de consumidores conscientes y regulaciones medioambientales m√°s estrictas en todo el mundo.

**2. Tecnolog√≠a y materiales utilizados en la fabricaci√≥n de bolsas reciclables de caf√©**  
Las bolsas de caf√© reciclables producidas por fabricantes chinos se destacan por su innovaci√≥n en materiales y procesos. Tradicionalmente, los empaques de caf√© utilizaban combinaciones de varias capas de materiales diferentes, como aluminio, PET y PE, lo que dificultaba su reciclaje. Sin embargo, los proveedores chinos est√°n adoptando estructuras monomateriales hechas completamente de polietileno (PE) o polipropileno (PP), lo que permite que las bolsas sean 100% reciclables sin sacrificar las propiedades de barrera que el caf√© requiere.

Estos nuevos materiales ofrecen una excelente protecci√≥n contra el ox√≠geno, la humedad, la luz y los olores, preservando la frescura del producto durante m√°s tiempo. Adem√°s, muchas bolsas incorporan v√°lvulas unidireccionales de desgasificaci√≥n, que permiten liberar el di√≥xido de carbono que desprenden los granos reci√©n tostados sin dejar entrar el aire. En cuanto a la impresi√≥n, se utilizan tintas ecol√≥gicas a base de agua y tecnolog√≠as de laminaci√≥n sin disolventes, reduciendo significativamente las emisiones contaminantes durante la producci√≥n. Estas innovaciones demuestran que la sostenibilidad puede coexistir perfectamente con la funcionalidad y la calidad.

**3. Ventajas competitivas de los fabricantes chinos de bolsas de caf√© reciclables**  
China ha logrado combinar eficiencia, innovaci√≥n y personalizaci√≥n en su oferta de bolsas reciclables. Los fabricantes chinos se destacan por su capacidad de adaptar sus productos a las necesidades espec√≠ficas de cada marca. Ofrecen una amplia gama de estilos ‚Äîcomo bolsas tipo stand-up, con cierre ‚Äúzip-lock‚Äù, con ventana transparente o con acabado mate o brillante‚Äî que mejoran la presentaci√≥n del producto en los estantes y atraen la atenci√≥n del consumidor.

Adem√°s, la tecnolog√≠a de impresi√≥n digital y flexogr√°fica de alta definici√≥n permite la producci√≥n de dise√±os personalizados, con colores vibrantes y detalles n√≠tidos. Esto es especialmente importante en el sector del caf√©, donde la est√©tica del empaque comunica la calidad y personalidad de la marca. Los fabricantes tambi√©n ofrecen soluciones de empaques inteligentes, integrando c√≥digos QR o etiquetas NFC para brindar informaci√≥n sobre el origen del caf√©, su trazabilidad y pr√°cticas sostenibles.

Otra ventaja significativa es la capacidad de producci√≥n a gran escala y los costos competitivos. Gracias a la s√≥lida infraestructura industrial de China, los proveedores pueden garantizar tiempos de entrega r√°pidos y precios accesibles sin comprometer la calidad. Adem√°s, muchos cuentan con certificaciones internacionales como ISO 14001, FSC, y BRC, que garantizan que sus procesos cumplen con los est√°ndares m√°s estrictos de sostenibilidad y seguridad alimentaria.

**4. Compromiso con la sostenibilidad y la econom√≠a circular**  
Los fabricantes chinos de bolsas de caf√© reciclables est√°n alineados con las pol√≠ticas verdes nacionales y las demandas globales de sostenibilidad. El gobierno chino ha implementado regulaciones estrictas para reducir el uso de pl√°sticos no reciclables y fomentar la econom√≠a circular, lo que ha impulsado la innovaci√≥n en toda la cadena de suministro del empaque. Las f√°bricas modernas integran procesos de reciclaje interno, reutilizaci√≥n de residuos de producci√≥n y uso de energ√≠a renovable.

Asimismo, muchos fabricantes est√°n colaborando con marcas internacionales para desarrollar empaques que no solo sean reciclables, sino tambi√©n reutilizables o compostables. Por ejemplo, se est√°n introduciendo bolsas fabricadas con biopl√°sticos derivados del ma√≠z o la ca√±a de az√∫car, que ofrecen una alternativa biodegradable sin perder resistencia. Este enfoque refuerza la reputaci√≥n de China como l√≠der en soluciones de empaque sostenibles. Adem√°s, las marcas que optan por bolsas reciclables pueden comunicar a sus consumidores un mensaje claro de responsabilidad social y compromiso con el planeta, generando mayor fidelidad y confianza.

**5. Perspectivas futuras del mercado de bolsas de caf√© reciclables**  
El futuro de las bolsas de caf√© reciclables fabricadas en China es prometedor. Se espera que el mercado global contin√∫e expandi√©ndose impulsado por tres factores clave: la creciente demanda de productos sostenibles, las regulaciones ambientales m√°s estrictas y la preferencia del consumidor por empaques ecol√≥gicos. Las innovaciones tecnol√≥gicas seguir√°n desempe√±ando un papel crucial, con el desarrollo de materiales inteligentes capaces de indicar la frescura del producto o monitorear su almacenamiento.

Adem√°s, la tendencia hacia el comercio electr√≥nico est√° generando una mayor necesidad de empaques duraderos, ligeros y reciclables que soporten el transporte sin da√±ar el medio ambiente. Los fabricantes chinos est√°n bien posicionados para liderar este cambio gracias a su experiencia, su capacidad de producci√≥n y su enfoque en la sostenibilidad. A medida que las marcas de caf√© contin√∫an buscando soluciones que combinen belleza, funcionalidad y respeto por el medio ambiente, las bolsas reciclables de origen chino seguir√°n ganando terreno en los mercados internacionales.

En conclusi√≥n, los fabricantes chinos de bolsas de caf√© reciclables representan la convergencia perfecta entre innovaci√≥n, calidad y sostenibilidad. Su enfoque en materiales ecol√≥gicos, dise√±o personalizado y tecnolog√≠a avanzada los convierte en socios estrat√©gicos para marcas comprometidas con el futuro del planeta. A medida que el mundo avanza hacia una econom√≠a m√°s verde, las bolsas de caf√© reciclables no solo ser√°n una tendencia, sino una necesidad para las empresas que buscan equilibrar la excelencia del producto con la responsabilidad ambiental.",1,1762010134.0,u_beautifulmind8494,0,1.0,False
1olqcnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1olqcnu/learning_to_budget_when_life_throws_you_curveballs/,Learning to Budget When Life Throws You Curveballs,"Last year, I found myself in a situation I never thought I‚Äôd be in. I had just started a new job, and for the first few months, everything seemed to be going smoothly. I was finally earning more than I had in years, and I started making plans for small luxuries I had been putting off for a long time, dining out, a little weekend getaway, even upgrading my phone.

Then, life hit me with a curveball. My car broke down, and the repair costs were far more than I had in savings. At first, I panicked. I thought about borrowing from friends or even using a credit card, but I knew I had to figure this out responsibly. I started tracking every dollar I spent, from coffee to groceries, and it was shocking how quickly little expenses added up.

I also realized that some of my ‚Äútreats‚Äù were not essential at all. I started meal prepping instead of ordering takeout and walked to work when I could to save on gas. It wasn‚Äôt glamorous, but slowly, I managed to cover the repair costs while still paying my regular bills. By the end of the month, I had even managed to put a little money aside, something I hadn‚Äôt done in years.

This experience taught me that budgeting isn‚Äôt just about restricting yourself; it‚Äôs about understanding where your money goes and making small, sustainable choices. I know not everyone has the same resources, and I definitely made mistakes along the way, but learning to manage my finances in a crisis made me feel more confident about the future. Now, even small setbacks feel more manageable because I know I can adapt and find a way through without sacrificing my stability.",0,1762010132.0,povertyfinance,5,0.25,False

The build goes like this - flatten both boards with router jig leaving the other side rough and glue up, let it sit for a week (garage is around 40-50deg f) 

Come back and its cupped upwards around 3/16 towards the flattened surface, I decide to spend around 3 hours flattening with hand planes, assemble legs,

 bring inside to apply shellac ect..

Now another week later its cupped completely the other way, maybe an extra 1/16-1/8"" past the original movement. It most likely would have been flat enough if I left it alone lol

1olqbsm,https://i.redd.it/dydlz3ilwnyf1.jpeg,Tips and tricks,"Okay soo my score came a while back, not up to the level that I wanted yet high enough. I noticed a lot are asking for tips so here is what worked and what not
Reading: I followed TOEFL Test youtube channel. She shares a lot of tips for the reading. 
Best tips were: questions for the same paragraph are consecutive. So if two questions are asking about paragraph 5,first one answer is let's say first half, the other will be what comes after. For the vocabs, familarize yourself with most common words. Don't overwhelm yourself
A tip was shared that don't read the text, count on answering the questions. This didn't work for me. I skim the text (first sentence and last sentence of each paragraph just to understand what's going on and figure out the questions especially the summary one) 
For the listening: I have a bechlors degree from an english heavy institute so my listening is already quite advanced. Yet here are a couple tips. 
1- take notes about main ideas. 
2- understand what's it like being an university studentr(having a lecture, dorms, roommates...) 
3- during lectures, actively write. Really write key details, explanations, ideas. They help in tricky questions. Just be careful to be too consumed in writing and forget to listen. 
4- this is a general tips but works for non native speaker. Listen to movies and mysic without captions and lyrics. Do your best to figure what they say then get used to what you don't
Speaking:
I am not the best in speaking but template template template. TST prep has amazing templates that help you get grounded and start automatically. Practice with Elsa speaking. It transcripts what you say and evaluate your grammar and fluency. It's an amazing tool. Aside from that, take notes during definitions and lectures. 
I am type of people who memorize by writing what they read/hear. So if that works for you, write down. But a tip, don't look down while speaking. Count on what you knew and speak. Unless you absolutely can't remember, then look at your paper. I did the mistake of looking while speaking so i ended up reading and losing what I am saying. So be careful. Also, get used on speaking in a loud environment. Coffee shop, streets, someone talking to you or playing a random podcast. Just get used to it. 
Finally writing: Again TST prep has amazing templates for you to use. A tip that worked for me was to take the main points of the text then during the lecture write the counter/supporting points. Practice on word document but make sure your auto correct is off so you can capture your mistake. Don't focus on speed, focus on efficiency. The more right coherent ideas you use, the better off you are. 
Also a tip no one mentioned but here you go, don't only practice specially typing on your laptop
Try to have a big keyboard similar to the one at the center. I was used on my laptop small keyboard so the bigger one led to typos due to a different offset. 
Lastly, make sure you use the official books and exams. Everything else is much easier than the exam. The official book tests are the closest one in everything

1olq3zm,https://i.redd.it/f7g5c87zunyf1.png,67/84.The Kamogawa Food Detective s by Hisahi Kashiwai. 5/5.,"Loved this book. Unlike some other books (cough cough Before the Coffee Gets Cold) this book calls out negative behavior or viewpoints that are out dated. Well in terms of people not food. Some characters enjoy old fashioned Kyoto food, but that's fine. I enjoyed those parts for they compared the many different ways you can make a dish, and how peoples' lifestyles affect the ingredients. The pacing was fantastic and constant (a must in a cozy read for me). The mini mysterious were very fun. I loved how they showed nostalgia could really affect modern life and how the same dishes can seem different. My favorite part is how the smallest thing you do to a dish can make a world of a difference (like>! tap water in one region differs from another!<). To me its a nice metaphor for life how one person can affect the dish and make it their own impacting people with their own take on things. The point of the detectives is not to lament in nostalgia, but instead to break the mystism of the past and explain or name that random taste/ingredient and show the client how to reproduce the dish themselves. They also try to help them figure out why they're randomly craving that dish suddenly or why that dish matters so much and dissect the psychological meaning of it.

1olq22n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoreyWayne/comments/1olq22n/what_do_you_think_about_this_situation/,What do you think about this situation?,"Hi, I recently discovered Corey Wayne‚Äôs work and I‚Äôve been applying his principles to some recent interactions I‚Äôve been having. However, I want to share my experience with a girl I met two months ago, before I knew about Corey‚Äôs work. As soon as I discovered his book, I read it, watched some of his videos, and started applying his advice to this girl.

Basically, I (M, 23) met this girl (22) a little over a month ago. We met at the entrance of a bar, there was chemistry, and I asked for her number. We agreed to go on a date a few days later and it was great ‚Äî we ended up kissing and decided to go out partying. She drank a lot that night (I don‚Äôt drink), and when I walked her home, she wanted to have sex with me on a bench in front of her building. I told her she was too drunk to do anything, and that I refused to have sex in the street. She said she didn‚Äôt want us to go up to her place because she had recently moved in and was embarrassed because of her roommates (we live in a university city, and the semester starts in September). I told her that the first time with her should be more ‚Äúelegant,‚Äù and she smiled, I kissed her, wished her goodnight, and went home.

After that, we had another date planned, but she canceled an hour before, saying that her mom and brother were coming to visit and she‚Äôd be spending the whole week with them. Since it was the first time it happened, I didn‚Äôt think much of it and said, ‚ÄúNo problem, just tell me when they leave and we‚Äôll pick a day that works for both of us.‚Äù So we met the following week, and it went great. She asked me about my past relationships, and I simply said, ‚ÄúI was with three girls a while ago, but hey, are you trying to tie me down already without me even meeting your parents?‚Äù She started laughing and told me she had never had a boyfriend, but she had three situationships, because she needed to find a man who was focused on his studies, close to his parents, and Catholic. (The Catholic thing surprised me since she had tried to have sex with me the first night we met in the street‚Ä¶) Then she told me that she was talking to other guys, and asked if that bothered me. I replied, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve only seen each other twice, why would it bother me?‚Äù

At the end of the night, we were in a private place in my car, and when we were making out, I tried to get more intimate with her, but she said she wanted to take things slower with me, that we barely knew each other. So we just kissed and touched a bit. That same night, she suggested going to a really nice place about an hour‚Äôs drive away ‚Äî she even suggested going that Friday. It sounded like a great plan, and I accepted since I had nothing else that day.

Okay, here‚Äôs where things started to go wrong: that very morning she canceled the plan, saying she had completely forgotten she already had plans with her best friend, and asked if we could do it another time. Since it was the second time she canceled last minute, I told her that I valued my time and that it seemed like we weren‚Äôt on the same page. I said that if she wanted us to keep seeing each other, she should suggest something to do and a day to meet. She said she didn‚Äôt expect that response at all and that it ‚Äúsaid a lot.‚Äù Then she said that if I didn‚Äôt want to see her again, she respected my decision. After that, I didn‚Äôt text her again.

However, days went by, and I noticed she still had me in her Instagram close friends, and she started liking my Instagram stories‚Ä¶ After about a week of that, I decided to message her saying, ‚ÄúI thought you didn‚Äôt want to hear from me again after what happened ‚Äî what‚Äôs with the likes?‚Äù She replied that she never said that. She said that the reason she hadn‚Äôt suggested meeting up was because it was the first time a guy had had that kind of ‚Äúattitude‚Äù with her, and she didn‚Äôt know how to react. She said she didn‚Äôt mind seeing me. So I suggested meeting up the following weekend for coffee to talk. We basically had another ‚Äúfirst date,‚Äù and it was great ‚Äî we didn‚Äôt talk about what had happened at all, we laughed a lot, and we kissed again‚Ä¶ But we still haven‚Äôt had sex due to the circumstances I mentioned. (FROM THIS POINT ON, I DISCOVERED COREY WAYNE‚ÄôS WORK.)

After that, I suggested meeting up not the following week, but the week after (because of work), so I have a date with her this Friday.

Since that ‚Äúmeeting,‚Äù I‚Äôve been trying to apply Corey‚Äôs principles: use the phone only to set dates, one date per week‚Ä¶ What do you think about my situation? Am I handling it well?

A few things I should clarify:

* She doesn‚Äôt live in my city ‚Äî she‚Äôs leaving in March to go back to her country.
* She‚Äôs extremely cold over text but very affectionate in person. (Meaning that even before learning Corey‚Äôs principles about using the phone only to set dates, I was probably texting her just three messages every two days.)
* I‚Äôm always the one who starts the conversations.",1,1762009399.0,CoreyWayne,1,1.0,False

As usual they had gifts for both our girls (5y and 18m old). And as they often do, they had a gift for my husband : clothes. Nothing for me. 

I really don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt need anything. But it has got my thinking : if my parents bring gifts it‚Äôs either just for the girls or something for everyone. Usually it will be a joint gift for my husband and I. The only time they get individual gifts for us is on our birthdays. But otherwise it‚Äôs always a joint gift. Granted, they don‚Äôt constantly bring gifts like my in-laws. To be honest I find it a bit overkill for the girls‚Ä¶

So I don‚Äôt want to come across as bitter. As I said, I don‚Äôt need gifts. But is it odd that they bring individual gifts for everyone but me almost every time they come?

They do occasionally give me a gift at Christmas. Often I get given the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù gift. Some food or something that will be shared. So not specifically for me. But never anything for my birthday.

Bullet‚ù§Ô∏è was one of my earlier purchases and it‚Äôs easily been my number 1 game ever since. It‚Äôs the only game I‚Äôve purchased expansions for, I‚Äôve easily put in 100+ plays, and I‚Äôm still really enjoying it. But I also enjoy variety and I‚Äôm looking to find some other games that I‚Äôll love just as much. 

*What I like about Bullet:* 

*Quick setup/tear down and relatively small table footprint* 

Unfortunately, this is kind of a requirement for me. I have a coffee table to play on and leaving a game out when I‚Äôm not playing isn‚Äôt an option currently. (I dream of one day having one of those fancy gaming tables lol) A slightly longer setup time isn‚Äôt as much of a deal breaker, but those games realistically just won‚Äôt get played as often as I‚Äôd like. 

*Variable character/enemy powers* 


This is probably the reason why Bullet still feels exciting after over 100 plays for me. With expansions I think I have 500+ combinations of heroines and bosses and they all feel different l. I love how certain character abilities completely change the mechanics how you approach the game or even break the game‚Äôs basic rules.  

*Clear win condition* 

Technically there is an infinite BYOS mode in Bullet but I mainly play the boss battle mode where the goal is to break all of the boss‚Äô shields to win. I don‚Äôt dislike BYOS games but having a clear goal feels more ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù to me if that makes sense. I‚Äôm not necessarily looking for boss battle games though. I really enjoyed Legacy of Yu where the win condition is completing canals. 

*Tactile puzzle* 

I‚Äôve played other combat games where the main mechanic to deal damage is just playing a card or rolling some dice, maybe spending some resources. Bullet feels special because it adds in the spatial puzzle of moving tokens around the board to fulfill your card requirements. I also enjoy tile placement games like Calico and Harmonies so that kind of abstract puzzling is something that really appeals to me. 

*Challenging without feeling impossible*


Two games in my collection that I think are objectively great games but that I don‚Äôt actually enjoy playing that much are Resist and Witchcraft.  In both games there‚Äôs this feeling of hopelessness, where you‚Äôre getting weaker and weaker until you inevitably give up, hoping you‚Äôve managed to do enough to win. Thematically, this works really well for these games but I tend to end those games feeling kinda bummed out rather than excited to try again. 

I‚Äôm Bullet the bosses are challenging and the games gets more chaotic as it goes on, but even when I lose I always feel like I could‚Äôve managed my AP better, not like the game‚Äôs randomness was stacked against me. Oftentimes a win or loss comes down to the last few moves of the final round, so even when I lose I feel like ‚ÄúI was **this** close! One more try!‚Äù 

I think this post got way too long so if you‚Äôve read all the way through, thank you! 

**Other games in my collection that I‚Äôve really enjoyed but aren‚Äôt quite on the same level as Bullet: **

Legacy of Yu, The White Castle, Onirim, Aerion, Urbion, Wingspan, Calico, Harmonies, A Gentle Rain, Dorfromantik (switch ver.), Three Sisters, Hadrian‚Äôs Wall 

**Games on my radar that I‚Äôm not sure of and would like the community‚Äôs opinion on: **

Spirit Island: Lots of people love this and it seems like it has high variability, but I‚Äôve never clicked with an area control game and I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt vibe with that aspect. I tried to learn both Root and Scythe and completely bounced off both despite loving the themes. 

Final Girl: Another game with a lot of variability but I‚Äôm not interested in horror films so the theme does nothing for me. I‚Äôm also worried about the challenge feeling hopeless. 

Dorfromantik Sakura: I had a lot of fun with the video game but got bored of the BYOS aspect after playing a lot. Do the challenges in the physics game‚Äôs campaign feel concrete enough to justify buying it too? ",5,1762008761.0,soloboardgaming,5,0.86,False

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

So firstly I‚Äôm not conservative and I‚Äôm not from the USA anyway and I am not religious the way I am is my own personal choice and how I have wanted to live my Life. I‚Äôm not intending to offend anyone at all I would ask those to be respectful towards me don‚Äôt report this post if you don‚Äôt like it im a very decent man I know what I want in life and I want to find a decent woman! If I don‚Äôt appeal to you please just move on! 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents! 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv.

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly not showing too much off with revealing clothing. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please.

1olpsbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1olpsbk/cannot_make_a_coffee_i_really_like_using_the_robot/,Cannot make a coffee I really like using the robot,"Hello,

I've been using a cafelat Robot for the past few months. It is my first manual espresso machine. 
I read a lot of advices on how to use the robot, and tried many coffees (Ethiopian, Brazilian, Columbian, blends, usually medium-roast and bought at a local roaster / coffee shop). I got a few not-so-bad cups, but mostly whatever the coffee used I found the result very bitter (and often too acidic / sour). It has flavor, and sometimes nuance, but I don't find it pleasant to drink. I even tried pre-ground supermarket coffee, which produced an ""ok"" cup using a friend's entry level expresso machine but was quite bad using the robot. 

Maybe I just haven't found the right coffee, but I'm starting to question my own taste. Though when I use the same coffee (obviously ground much coarser) for a v60 or aeropress, I find the taste better, so maybe my technique is wrong? 

I usually use 18g of coffee, water up the top of the portafilter, and a grind size that results in a 30 to 40 seconds extraction for around 40ml of coffee, so I thought it would be OK. I preinfuse for a few seconds. I have trouble consistently reaching (and even more maintaining) a pressure above 5 or 6 though, even pressing really hard. If I grind finer, it gets nearly impossible to press. If I grind coarser, then the extraction is done in 20 seconds and I get less pressure. 

Any advice? Maybe I need to press even stronger to reach a shorter extraction time and higher pressure, but it's kind of a small  workout already :) (I put the robot in a lower table to reduce the needed strength) ",1,1762008730.0,CafelatRobot,12,1.0,False

I got fed up and built a simple tool that automatically fixes your text before you even paste it.. PDF Text Cleaner: automatically removes all broken line breaks from PDF.,"https://preview.redd.it/4riehbxhrnyf1.png?width=1697&format=png&auto=webp&s=14be9395b11f04de8cc821d00f648471152fb9f1

Hey everyone,

As a grad student, my life revolves around reading academic papers. I'm sure many of you know this exact pain:



You want to copy this clean sentence:

>

But instead, you paste it and get this broken mess:

>

Manually deleting every single line break is a nightmare. Using online ""fixer"" websites is also a pain‚Äîit's a clunky, multi-step process (`copy -> paste-to-site -> copy-again -> paste-to-notes`) that kills your workflow.

So, I built the tool I always wanted: **PDF\_Text\_Cleaner**.

It‚Äôs a tiny, simple Windows program that just solves this one problem perfectly.



# The ""Magic"" is the Automation



You don't have to change your habits at all. No sites, no hotkeys, no extra clicks.

It just runs in a small console window (you can minimize it) and quietly watches your clipboard.

1. You `Ctrl+C` the broken text from your PDF.
2. The tool *instantly* and *automatically* detects the text, removes all the line breaks, and saves the clean text back to your clipboard.
3. You `Ctrl+V` into your notes, and the corrected, single-paragraph text appears.

It‚Äôs a true, invisible `Ctrl+C` ‚Üí `Ctrl+V` fix.



# Why it's better than online tools:



* **Fully Automatic:** Just `Ctrl+C`. That's it.
* **100% Private & Offline:** It never collects *any* of your data. If you‚Äôve ever hesitated to paste sensitive research into a random online tool, this is for you.
* **No Ads, No Limits:** No ads, no pop-ups, no character limits. Ever.
* **Lightweight & Portable:** It‚Äôs a tiny \~11MB file. No installation needed. Just unzip (it's one `.exe` and a `README.txt`) and run.

I built this for people like me:

* Students & Researchers handling academic papers.
* Professionals working with PDF reports.
* Anyone who values privacy and hates annoying web ads.

I've set the price at **$3.99**‚Äîless than a single Starbucks coffee for a tool that will save you hours of work.

I'm launching it today and would be honored if you'd check it out and give me your feedback!

**To avoid the Reddit spam filters, I‚Äôve put the link to the demo video and the Gumroad download page in the first comment.**

1olpqle,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1olpqle/finding_strength_in_vulnerability_an_unexpected/,Finding strength in vulnerability - an unexpected journey,"
So, last year (I was 27F then, 28F now), I went through a terrible breakup that shattered my self-esteem and made me question everything I knew about love. My ex-boyfriend (31M) was my first serious relationship - we'd been together since college, almost 7 years. We'd seen each other through countless ups and downs, job changes, family struggles; we even adopted our dog, Cooper, together. When we broke up, it felt as though my life was falling apart.

He'd been cheating on me, as clich√© as that might sound. The revelation hit me like a freight train - I'd been so sure of our relationship, so sure of him. I found out through a mutual friend, who'd seen him out with this other woman, and I confronted him about it. We argued, we cried, and in the end, we broke up.

Living on my own again was hard. Our apartment was littered with memories - photographs, shared clothes, the quirky little trinkets we'd bought together on trips. Cooper seemed confused for the first few weeks, too. He'd wait by the door, expecting his dad to come home, and it broke my heart every time. 

I didn't know how to exist without him. My self-worth had become so entwined with him that I'd lost sight of who I was. I'd wake up some mornings, staring at the ceiling, wondering who I was without him.

Therapy was my saving grace - I started going to sessions twice a week. My therapist (a wonderful woman in her late 50s) helped me realize that it's okay to feel broken, to grieve the loss of what I thought was my forever. She helped me understand that my worth wasn't tied to him or our relationship.

I started focusing on myself. I rekindled old hobbies - painting, hiking, playing the piano. I reconnected with old friends. I even joined a book club! As I healed, I found joy in simple things - a sunny day, a good book, a cup of coffee. It felt like I was rediscovering the world through new eyes.

One year on, I'm still healing. But now, I've found strength in my vulnerability. I've found my voice, my individuality, my self-esteem. I've cried, I've hurt, but I've also grown. I am stronger than I ever knew I could be.

TL;DR: Last year, my long-term boyfriend cheated on me and we broke up. It shattered me, but through therapy and self-discovery, I've found strength in my vulnerability and rebuilt my self-esteem. It's been a challenging journey, but I'm proud of how far I've come.",4,1762008618.0,TwoXChromosomes,1,1.0,False

She was my teacher at the time. After the semester ended, she invited me for coffee, and from there, things moved fast. We started seeing each other more, and within months, we were basically living together.

When I moved in with her, I found out she had lied about her age. She told me she was 24, but she was actually 32. I was 19 back, it didn't bother me too much back then because she looked young, fit, and took great care of herself, and she showed genuine interest in me.    She also told me I was her first, which made me feel special and needed.  

The early months of our relationship were full of small red flags that I ignored:  Random late-night phone calls from someone; conversations with someone she later brushed off as ‚Äúnothing"".  But eventually these stopped as I had made it clear it bothers me.  
I  was in love, and I thought love meant patience and trust.

Two years into the relationship, she started becoming more controlling and emotionally manipulative, especially when marriage came up. I wasn‚Äôt ready.  

I told her honestly that if marriage was so important to her, maybe she should find someone else.    But every time I tried to step back, she‚Äôd break down crying, talking about how her life would fall apart without me, how she had no friends, how society had already turned its back on her.    I stayed because I felt guilty leaving someone so fragile, but also because I cared about her.  

Over time, I took more and more responsibility. I helped with cleaning, I fully handled bills, groceries, her cat, organizing trips, gifts, all of it. I was proud to be a good man.  

Our intimacy was strange from the start. She never wanted the lights on. She didn‚Äôt want me to touch her private parts or look at her under the light. Always the same positions.    Sometimes I complained, wanted to cuddle during the day, wanted to take showers together, wanted surprise sex, asked her to wear some old sexy underwear she owns, but my requests usually turned into how I can't accept her body and how I look better than her, that I'm fit, have a good skin tone, how she's jealous of how other women look at me.  

I finally usually give up on arguing because it gets so inflamed, we go through long streaks of a dead bedroom.  

In late 2019, she asked me to propose ‚Äúsymbolically.‚Äù She said she knew I wasn‚Äôt ready for marriage but wanted a ring ‚Äújust to feel loved.‚Äù I agreed. It felt harmless.  

Then in early 2020, she told me she was pregnant. I wasn't especially shocked since I notived she skipped her pills sometimes, but I never imagined it would lead to this because we didn't have sex often, mostly once or twice a month. Still, I didn‚Äôt argue I had decided to comfort her, and reassure her that I'm not mad and that I will support her.  

I month later, we decided to get married. Our daughter was born in November 2020, it was a nice moment in my life and I love her more than anything in the world. But during the whole pregnancy and for six months after the birth, my wife refused any intimacy. Not even a kiss. She said she didn‚Äôt want a kiss or affection to lead to sex, which could trigger a  miscarriage, which is only partly true.  

When our daughter was born, she had never been in the mood to show or receive affection either, she got post partum depression, I tried not to bring on the matter of affection, but it was written all over my face that I was hungry for a kiss, a touch or intimacy.  

That period was brutal but I managed. I worked, studied, took care of our baby, cooked, cleaned, and did everything around the house. I thought I was being strong, loyal, and patient. I wanted to be the man my daughter could look up to.  

Then one day in 2021, while cleaning, I found a USB drive. I thought it was mine. When I opened it, I saw photos of my wife with who turned out to be an ex  some of the photos were intimate.    My world just collapsed and I didn‚Äôt know what to think, I had a rush of feelings, and just sat on the floor for a solid 30min.    

A few days later, at her parents‚Äô house, I was working on her mom's desktop when I found another very similar USB with more photos, I straight went to our room to grasp some fresh air at the window, I had this immediate idea to open her drawers and to my surprise I found some old love letters, they were about that ex, and there was talk about another man too, which led me to understand that she was involved with at least two men.  My heart sank deeper. All those years she had sworn I was her first. I felt humiliated.  

When I confronted her, she denied everything, accused me of ‚Äúinvading her privacy,‚Äù and said I was ‚Äúscaring our baby.‚Äù Every time I tried to talk about it, she‚Äôd twist the situation until I felt like the bad guy.  

After that, I couldn‚Äôt see her the same way. I asked her for honesty, at least an apology. but she refused.  

I brought up the fact that she‚Äôd gotten pregnant without my real consent, and she said, ‚ÄúIf you agree to sex, you agree to pregnancy.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even know what to say to that, maybe she's right about it, maybe not, ethically I'm devided.  

Weeks went by without us talking, sleeping separately, she refused to discuss anything, eventually we separated in 2022.   

I moved back to my parents‚Äô place. I‚Äôve been helping her financially and staying in touch with our daughter.  

 We‚Äôve talked a few times about getting back together, but she‚Äôs become more bitter and paranoid. She says my family ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù our marriage, even though I barely talked to them during those years.  

Now it‚Äôs 2025. I want a divorce. I don‚Äôt have the energy or peace to keep living in this limbo. But she refuses to end things. She says if I file, she‚Äôll make sure I never see our daughter again. She calls me a coward.  

I don‚Äôt hate her. She‚Äôs not a bad person in every way, she‚Äôs intelligent, educated, beautiful in her special way, clean, cultured, and takes care of our daughter very well. But I‚Äôm emotionally done. I‚Äôve given everything I could, and I don‚Äôt recognize myself anymore.  

The guilt eats at me. I feel like I‚Äôm abandoning my family, even though I know this marriage has been over for years. I‚Äôm tired of being manipulated by fear and guilt.  

If anyone here has been through something similar, where you still care about your spouse as a person but know deep down that it‚Äôs time to walk away.  

how did you find the strength to do it?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hoje chegou meu primeiro moedor de caf√©, o el√©trico automatizado da I-coffee. Levo a s√©rio o hobby h√° +/- 6 meses, e desde ent√£o venho procurando incansavelmente algo como ele, simples e pr√°tico.

H√° alguns dias, o Gabriel Barros (Pirados por caf√©) fez um review sobre ele e me interessei muito pela proposta e resolvi encabe√ßar de vez com ele.

Aqui v√£o minhas primeiras impress√µes (leigas) sobre esse moedor. Lembre-se que todos os elogios, s√£o baseados na categoria e valor.

1- Acabamento excelente:

90% em metal, apenas pequenas pe√ßas bem espec√≠ficas e n√£o necess√°rias para durabilidade do mesmo s√£o em pl√°stico. Borda bem acabadas, sem rebarbas. Fundo emborrachado.

2 - Compartimento se moagem em pentagrama:

Sempre quando ou√ßo falar de ""moedores custo benef√≠cio"", possuem esse formato.

3 - Pesado:

Traz confian√ßa ao uso, diminuindo o medo de poss√≠veis quedas por pequenas instabilidades que possam haver.

4 - Sistema de desarme autom√°tico em 6 segundos ap√≥s finaliza√ß√£o da moagem:

Algo de se orgulhar, em um moedor el√©trico de entrada.

5 - Compartimento de moagem generoso:

Segundo manual, comporta at√© 35g de √∫nica moagem. Isso pro meu dia a dia √© √≥timo, pois costumo fazer doses grandes de caf√©. Detalhe √© que essa informa√ß√£o n√£o encontrei em lugar nenhum, a n√£o ser no manual. 

6 - Valor pago: 176,90. N√£o poderia faltar.

Aos iniciantes, como eu:

Pretendo, assim que eu puder, fazer um ""review"" detalhado com informa√ß√µes como: dura√ß√£o real de bateria (manual indica de 20-25 usos), const√¢ncia de moagem, etc, para ajudar aos que ainda n√£o t√™m certeza dele. 

Aos s√™niors: 

Se puderem me dar dicas de uso e cuidados, agrade√ßo muito. Tamb√©m gostaria que me dessem pontos importantes que eu possa tratar e que queiram saber a respeito dele (mesmo que de curiosidade), n√£o s√≥ para voc√™s, mas tamb√©m para outros iniciantes do grupo.",8,1762008351.0,cafebrasil,0,1.0,False

I want to share the completely unfiltered story of the most insane growth month of my life. You might not believe it all started with a single tweet, but it did.

It was an ordinary Tuesday night, scrolling through X as usual. My timeline was flooded with the same pain point, one after another: a SaaS founder complaining he spent an entire weekend on a product demo video; a marketing consultant lamenting she couldn't afford a professional video team; an indie developer launching his new project with a static, lifeless screenshot.

That's when it hit me. The pain was so universal, so acute. I immediately replied to one of them: ""What if a tool could generate a professional, voice-overed, animated promo video from just simple text and images in minutes?""

His reply: ""Shut up and take my money!""

It was time to move.

I didn't hesitate. That night, I scrolled through my contacts and found a brilliant backend engineer I'd met at Google Cloud Next, living in Austin. I sent him an email with a one-line subject:

""Do you want to spend the rest of your life writing code, or do you want a chance to change the world?""

The body contained just one line: ""It's time to fix this mess of video creation. First call tomorrow morning?""

My phone rang at 7 AM the next day. A voice, equally tired and excited, was on the other end: ""I thought about it all night. I'm in.""

My co-founder was on board. Just like that, in 12 hours. We decided to replicate the Silicon Valley legend... in my garage.

Phase 1: Forging the Sword (Week 1)

We knew speed was everything. We adopted a ruthlessly focused product strategy:

We cut all complex features, focusing on one core magic trick: Input images/text, output a 60-second video with captions, music, and smooth transitions.

Like the early Instagram team, we did user testing every day at 5 PM, pulling in neighbors and friends, asking one question: ""Would you pay for this?""

Our tech stack boldly used Next.js and FastAPI, allowing us to iterate at TikTok speed.

Phase 2: The Blitz (Week 2)

With a working prototype, we decided to replicate the Calendly growth playbook.

Monday, Product Hunt Launch: We didn't just submit a product. We published a deep-dive into our AI model's architecture. It took the #1 spot, bringing in 1,200 waitlist signups.

Tuesday, Hacker News Infiltration: A post titled ""The 'ChatGPT Moment' for Video Generation is Here"" made it to the top 3. The debate drove traffic; our servers crashed three times from the influx‚Äîa good problem to have.

Wednesday, The TikTok Gambit: We skipped mega-influencers. We found 5 micro-creators in the ""startup stories"" and ""productivity tools"" niche. We created personalized videos for each, solving their pain points with our tool. One‚Äî""I Used AI to Beat Procrastination & Made 30 Promo Videos in a Week""‚Äîwent viral, driving over 50,000 clicks.

Phase 3: Building the Machine (Weeks 3 & 4)

The momentum was there; now we had to systemize it.

Precision Ad Bombing: We ran hard-hitting A/B tests on LinkedIn targeting ""SaaS Founders"" and ""Digital Marketing Managers."" Ad A was ""Save Time."" Ad B was ""Boost Conversions."" Ad B outperformed by 47%. We shifted all budget there.

Content Engine at Full Throttle: We started publishing systematically. A blog post, ""10 Irresistible E-commerce Video Templates,"" brought in steady SEO traffic. We even launched a podcast sharing our ""garage startup"" story.

Data-Driven Optimization: We built a full analytics dashboard, Snowflake-style. We found the signup-to-first-video conversion rate was the bottleneck. We redesigned the onboarding flow and boosted that rate by 22% in a week.

The results? They spoke for themselves.

Day 3: Waking up on the garage couch at 7 AM, I opened Stripe. The number jolted me awake: $1,024. Early adopters were paying. We had actually done it.

Week 1: The number grew to $10,118. The curve was no longer linear; it was getting steeper. For the first time, my co-founder and I allowed ourselves to believe we might be onto something.

Month 1: On a Monday morning, I brewed an expensive cup of coffee, took a deep breath, and hit refresh. The Stripe dashboard loaded. The number I had dreamt of was right there, staring back at me: $100,842 MRR.

From zero to $100k in Monthly Recurring Revenue. In 30 days. We had made history.

A wave of pure joy and accomplishment washed over me. I shook my co-founder awake in the next room, ready to celebrate...

...And then my real alarm clock went off.

I jolted upright in my own familiar bed. There was no co-founder. No garage.

My heart was still racing from the dream. I instinctively grabbed my phone, opened a browser, and looked at the website we had poured our hearts into‚Äî
‚Äîits elegant interface and smooth tools still filled me with a sense of pride. I took a deep breath and logged into the Stripe dashboard, hoping the miracle had somehow leaked into reality.

""Yes!"" I almost yelled‚Äîthe user list clearly showed 2 paying customers!

My god, had the dream come true? I was about to laugh out loud, until I focused on the two usernames.

One was ""test_account_01"".
The other was ""colin_test_payment"".

1olpm9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GuardingPearSoftware/comments/1olpm9w/managing_insider_threats_in_hybrid_workplaces/,Managing Insider Threats in Hybrid Workplaces,"

As more companies embrace hybrid work models, where employees split time between the office and remote work, a new cybersecurity challenge is rising to the top: insider threats.  
An insider threat is any risk to an organization‚Äôs security that comes from someone with authorized access to its systems, data, or networks.  
Insider threats typically fall into three main categories: malicious insiders, negligent insiders, and compromised insiders.

**Malicious insiders** are individuals who intentionally exploit their access for personal gain or to cause damage. This could involve stealing sensitive data, sabotaging systems, or leaking confidential information. For example, a former employee may deliberately leak a company‚Äôs customer database shortly before departing the organization, to cause both financial and reputational damage.

**Negligent insiders** don‚Äôt act with ill intent but still pose a significant threat due to careless behavior or poor security practices. These include actions like using weak passwords, misplacing devices, or inadvertently clicking on phishing links. A 2024 study revealed that 35% of data breaches were attributed to negligent actions, such as connecting personal devices to unsecured networks or mishandling confidential files.

**Compromised insiders** refer to employees whose accounts or credentials have been hijacked by external attackers. In such cases, hackers gain access to internal systems by exploiting legitimate accounts, often through tactics like phishing or malware. For example, attackers may steal browser cookies to hijack an employee's session, granting them unauthorized access to critical internal infrastructure.



## Why Hybrid Work Increases Insider Risk

Hybrid workplaces introduce new security challenges that make insider threats, both intentional and accidental, much harder to detect and prevent. Several factors contribute to this increased vulnerability.

### 1. Reduced Visibility
In traditional office environments, security teams have greater control and visibility over devices, networks, and employee behavior. But in hybrid setups, employees often work from personal or remote devices, making it harder to monitor activity in real time. Employees now access sensitive systems from a variety of locations, including home offices, public Wi-Fi in coffee shops, and shared workspaces, frequently switching between corporate laptops, personal phones, and unmanaged devices.  
This distributed and device-diverse workforce has introduced major visibility gaps, making it difficult for security teams to monitor activity, enforce policies, or detect suspicious behavior in real time. Shadow IT, where employees use unauthorized tools or applications, is more likely to flourish outside the watchful eye of IT teams, creating hidden entry points for attackers.

### 2. Weaker Boundaries Between Work and Home
The line between professional and personal environments becomes blurred in hybrid work. Employees may share devices with family members or conduct sensitive tasks over unsecured home Wi-Fi. To streamline their workflows, many also use personal USB drives and cloud storage, increasing the likelihood of data leakage or unauthorized access, intentionally or not.

### 3. Disengagement and Disgruntlement
Remote workers may feel isolated or disconnected from their workplace culture, leading to lower engagement and a diminished sense of loyalty. In times of company stress, such as layoffs, restructuring, or poor performance reviews, disgruntled employees might act out through sabotage, data theft, or deliberate policy violations.

### 4. Social Engineering 
Even trustworthy and well-meaning staff can fall victim to manipulation. Cybercriminals often use tactics like phishing emails, fake tech support calls, or impersonation to deceive employees into revealing login credentials, clicking malicious links, or even transferring funds. These techniques exploit human trust, effectively turning unsuspecting individuals into accidental accomplices in a security breach.


## How to Manage Insider Threats in Hybrid Workplaces

As hybrid work becomes the norm, managing insider threats requires a proactive and layered security strategy. Organizations must address both technical vulnerabilities and human behaviors to reduce risk effectively. Here‚Äôs how:

### 1. Implement Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)
Limit access to data and systems based strictly on job roles. Employees should only be able to access the information they need to perform their duties. Regularly review and update access permissions, especially after promotions, departmental changes, or departures, to prevent unnecessary exposure. This principle helps limit insider risk by minimizing the ""blast radius"" of a potential breach.

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Adding a second layer of identity verification (such as a one-time code or biometric scan) significantly reduces the chance of account compromise, especially from stolen credentials. MFA is a crucial defense against phishing and credential-based attacks.

### 3. Monitor Behavior, Not Just Devices
Traditional security tools often focus on endpoints, but insider threats can go undetected without behavioral analysis. Use User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to identify anomalies such as unusual login times, large file transfers, or access from unexpected locations. Spotting these red flags early can prevent serious breaches.

### 4. Establish Clear Remote Work Policies
Clearly define acceptable practices for using personal devices, cloud services, and sharing information externally. Ensure all employees understand what‚Äôs permitted and what‚Äôs prohibited. Regular training on data handling, phishing awareness, and secure collaboration reinforces these policies and builds a more security-conscious workforce.

### 5. Encrypt Everything
Encrypt sensitive data both at rest (stored files) and in transit (during communication or file sharing). Organizations should also provide secure tools that safeguard data and communications across remote environments. This includes VPNs to encrypt internet traffic and protect sensitive information from being intercepted on unsecured networks, such as public Wi-Fi. Encrypted messaging apps ensure that internal communications remain private and tamper-proof, even outside company firewalls. 

### 6. Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Tools
Deploy DLP solutions to monitor and control the flow of sensitive data. These tools can automatically block or flag attempts to send confidential information via email, upload it to cloud platforms, or transfer it to USB drives, helping prevent leaks before they happen.

### 7. Track Offboarding Closely
Employee exits are a prime window for insider threats. Revoke access to systems, email, cloud services, and VPNs immediately upon resignation or termination. It's also important to monitor user activity leading up to departure, as data exfiltration often occurs in the final days or weeks of employment.

### 8. Foster a Culture of Trust and Accountability
Employees who feel valued, supported, and engaged are less likely to become insider threats. Encourage open communication, listen to feedback, and offer mental health and career support. 


## Conclusion
Insider threats aren‚Äôt new, but the hybrid workplace has magnified them. With people working from home, coffee shops, and coworking spaces, the lines between personal and professional are blurrier than ever. That‚Äôs why managing insider risk in 2025 means more than just installing software. It‚Äôs about building visibility, trust, and smart access controls into your hybrid strategy.  
You can‚Äôt eliminate insider threats, but you can reduce their impact.

My current recipe is 15g beans to 250g water @92-93C. 

TLDR: my P2 makes a lot of fines and I gotta really aggressively stir so that it doesn‚Äôt choke during draw down. 

45g bloom for 45 seconds, digging up and turning over the grinds during the bloom. Then I pour the rest in one pour. After I‚Äôve poured all the water I take a butter knife and stir (at a high enough speed that creates a small vortex) until all the water has drawn down into the grounds then I wait for the drawn down to finish. In total it‚Äôs usually about 2:20-2:30. 

Before I did no agitation and it took wayyyy too long for draw down. Then I tried swirling and still too way too long. Then I tried wet wdt and it STILL took way too long and was still bitter. Then I got fed up and just stirred it aggressively for the entire draw down and that finally got the brew time from 3:30 down to 2:20. 

The coffee is coming out good now. I know they‚Äôre a cheaper grinder and they seem to produce a lot of fines but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has this issue with the kingeinders.

Let me start by telling you a bit about myself. I (23M) recently joined a Master‚Äôs program at one of the reputed government institutes in the country. I like to keep my circle small ‚Äî at every stage of life I have made one or two close friends and they have always stayed. I never really had much interaction with girls, and between studies and everything else, I just never got the time or chance to fall into a relationship. I like reading books, research papers, listening to old classics, watching shows and movies and enjoy playing sports or outdoor games. I‚Äôm around 5'9"", with an athletic body .

I think that‚Äôs enough about me ‚Äî now about her.

**Phase-1 (Till coursework starting):\[First 15 days\]**

I first saw her during our batch gathering after I moved into my hostel inside the campus ‚Äî few days before the course officially started. That night, after we all introduced ourselves and were about to leave, I met a guy who is now my closest friend. Around 10 p.m., he and I went for a walk, and when I was heading back to my hostel about an hour later (which is very close to the girls‚Äô hostel), I saw her coming out. I said ‚Äúhi‚Äù quietly, without even thinking. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know why I did that‚Ä¶ but that simple ‚Äúhi‚Äù became the root of everything. She recognized me and asked if I‚Äôd like to go for a walk (it was around 11 p.m.). I thought saying no would feel rude, so I joined her. We ended up walking and talking for about an hour ‚Äî sharing our backgrounds, hostel stories, and reasons for joining the course. \[let me tell one thing that she was from such a bachelor‚Äôs background that this course was going to be tough for her and she kind of knew that\] .Before parting, she asked me for some study-related resources and some useful playlists, which I sent her after coming back to my room. For context, she‚Äôs 24F (5'4"" maybe) with a slim body and that guy I met earlier is from the same state as her, though a different city. She and I are from different states but both from north India.

The next day, our seniors held a meeting with us around 10 p.m. We all went, had some introductions and discussions. While we were heading back to the hostels, I ran into her again ....she was behind me, and when I turned around, she caught my eye and started talking. We ended up going for another walk, talking about our families, studies, and how the course might go. Before we split for the night, she suggested we should explore the campus together the next afternoon, and I agreed because I also wanted to check out the departments before classes began as the campus was huge. The next day we met again and roamed around the campus for about two hours, just talking about random things nothing too personal like past relationships or anything. She mentioned she had spoken to one or two other girls from our batch, but among the boys, only me. I wasn‚Äôt too surprised ‚ÄîI felt like she was only talking to me because we were all new and she didn‚Äôt really know many people yet. She already knew that guy I had met the first night during the introduction time. Still, I did wonder why she chose to spend time with me. I also noticed that when she talks, she smiles a lot and keeps steady eye contact ‚Äî that was actually surprising. I‚Äôve never been that comfortable holding eye contact with girls.

Over the next few days a lot of things happened. She once mentioned she needed a phone cover for her new mobile but didn‚Äôt know the city well neither do I and since her relative stayed far from the institute, she asked me to help. I went with her, and that was one of our first times going out together. She would text me at random ‚Äî small things, nothing major. Once she sent a picture of a chocolate asking if I wanted some; I wasn‚Äôt really in the mood, so I just replied casually. I told her I sometimes play table tennis in my hostel court and she got interested, saying she‚Äôd like to play sometime and that I should call her. She also asked me to come to a few fresher events, but I‚Äôm not a crowd person, so I didn‚Äôt go. One evening, she asked me to help fix her institute Wi-Fi. Since boys aren‚Äôt allowed inside the girls‚Äô hostel, I asked her to come to the bench near my hostel it was raining, and we sat there while I got it working. One night we went cycling together around the campus, and later she showed me pictures of how she had decorated her hostel room. Sometimes she'd ask me what I was doing in my room. She‚Äôd also ask me study-related questions every now and then. I also noticed she says ‚Äòthank you‚Äô a lot ‚Äî for even the smallest things. By this point, I had a feeling she might be interested, but it had only been about fifteen days since we met, and I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was just overthinking. I kept my calm and didn‚Äôt say anything, though I had already started developing feelings for her. She was always the one to initiate our chats mostly and I would always reply.

**Phase-2 (After coursework Started):\[next 2 months\]**

When the coursework started, everyone in our batch knew it was going to be tough. We all tried focusing from the very first day. I was never the topper type, but I was confident in my specialized areas ‚Äî the ones that actually mattered for this program. Naturally, I started concentrating more on my studies, and our interaction began to slow down. She also got busier, talking more with other girls from the batch. We had a few common courses, and one core subject together. I knew coursework would be difficult for her ....she had already told me that earlier ...so I didn‚Äôt want to disturb her. I began messaging her less, maybe every 3‚Äì4 days but she replied every time quick. The first time I did that, the very next day while walking to class, she casually asked what I was doing for the past three days. I told her I‚Äôd been studying in my room. But I could sense from her tone that she was a little disappointed. I don‚Äôt really talk much with other girls since I don‚Äôt know them that well. Also, by then, I had started liking her, so I didn‚Äôt think it would be right to talk too freely with other girls. We never really talked in front of anyone ‚Äî not that we planned it that way, it just happened. In class, I would usually sit with my close friend and chat with a few other guys.

One day she asked me to go for a walk, and I agreed. During that walk, I suggested that we could go for late-night walks on weekends after 11 p.m., and she agreed. I thought maybe I should also start putting in some effort from my side, so I suggested it. Slowly, I began messaging her even less since I had to focus on my own studies too, and I didn‚Äôt want to disturb her either. She did the same, and we mostly texted on weekends. Our talks were mainly about studying, which was fine with me since the coursework was genuinely tough. One day I called her to play table tennis, and after the game she asked me to show her a book I had mentioned before. I told her it was in my room, so she came for the first time. We talked only about studies, and then she left. When the first assignment came, she reached out again and came to my room to take pictures of my work. That‚Äôs when I began noticing a pattern ‚Äî she seemed to talk more when there were assignments or when she couldn‚Äôt figure something out, even using AI tools. Still, we would play TT on weekends, and she would always agree whenever I called her for walks. She once mentioned that if we continued playing TT regularly, we‚Äôd become really good in two years. During our weekend walks, she often told me that she gets tired studying at night and has dark circles under her eyes. I‚Äôd tell her to take care and not overdo it. She was focused on her career, at least that‚Äôs what she told me and I genuinely liked that about her.

In our batch, there were two boys and two girls ‚Äî let‚Äôs call them Boy A, Boy B, Girl A, and Girl B. Girl A is from my state, and I had talked to her once or twice earlier about some document-related queries. Like in every college, small groups slowly start forming over time, and she slowly became part of this group since the other two girls were already a part of it. Gradually, I noticed she began talking to other boys in a similar friendly way ‚Äî smiling, maintaining eye contact, and keeping the same tone ‚Äî and I realized that‚Äôs just how she naturally interacts with people.

Around this time, I told my close friend everything about her. He wasn‚Äôt surprised ‚Äî he said he had talked to her before about some document-related stuff since they‚Äôre from the same state, which sounded normal. There‚Äôs also another girl in our batch from my state, and I had walked and talked with her a couple of times for document verification matters. In fact, that other girl had called me for a walk for 2‚Äì3 days, and I went ‚Äî it was only during the first week after I moved into the hostel, and we just discussed some important official stuff, nothing more. So that part felt ordinary too. But then my friend mentioned that the girl I liked had called him as well to ask for notes and material. That confused me a bit because she usually asks me for that. Day by day, I noticed she texted me mostly when she needed something ‚Äî usually study-related. But we still continued our usual TT games on weekends and our walks.

One day, some days before an important exam, she asked me to go for a walk. During that walk, she talked mostly about the exam, which was fine by me. Suddenly, it started raining heavily, and we took shelter under a shed. We ended up talking about our families after a long time. Then she showed me her video assignment. I had asked her to show it earlier, but she had said it was a bit embarrassing. That evening, she played it for me while it was raining. I didn‚Äôt watch the video directly ‚Äî I just listened to what she was saying and gave her feedback on what parts felt repetitive. I think she liked that I paid attention and listened carefully. After that, she started talking about a book she had read long ago. When the rain slowed down, we walked back under my umbrella. The road was dark, and our shoulders brushed three times. Each time, she said ‚Äúsorry‚Äù softly. I didn‚Äôt say anything. I‚Äôve never intentionally or even accidentally touched her before I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right unless both people are sure about each other‚Äôs feelings. Later that night, when I was about to sleep, she sent me the book she had mentioned and told me to read it. Then she asked if I write diary. I said I used to, back in school. She sent me a few pages from her own diary to read ‚Äî along with a picture of her room back home ‚Äî and suddenly she started calling me ‚Äúsir.‚Äù That really surprised me. The diary pages weren‚Äôt deeply personal ‚Äî they were more about her mindset, how she wanted to change herself, become independent, not rely on anyone, etc. I actually liked what I read. I told her she could send me more if she wanted... I‚Äôd be happy to read them.

That same night, during our walk, we ended up making a small, silly challenge ‚Äî nothing serious ‚Äî but the deal was that whoever lost would treat the other person. I lost, and after two days, she came to play TT with me (just before exams...she was the one to initiate messages about playing TT..) and reminded me about the treat. I said I‚Äôd treat her, and we decided a particular date. By that time, though, I was honestly confused. I wanted to be sure whether she actually liked me or not.

So, after talking to a few of my old friends, they all advised me to just ask her out properly ‚Äî to invite her for a treat at a nice restaurant off-campus. I was hesitant at first because I was scared she might say no. But my every close friend said she‚Äôd definitely say yes after everything that had happened between us. So, I gathered some courage and texted her after the exam was over. She replied nearly fifteen minutes later, saying, ‚ÄòYou took that so seriously; coffee or ice cream will do.‚Äô Well‚Ä¶ yeah, I felt hurt ‚Äî kind of disappointed, actually. I don‚Äôt even know how to explain it. Somehow, I just said it‚Äôs okay if she only wants coffee ...changed the topic and made things a bit normal again. The next day, I treated her and she mentioned that for some silly challenge, I don't need to give her a grand treat. After that, she started asking about what chocolates I liked, saying that she would like to treat me too. I told her I don‚Äôt usually take treats (I mean was kind of disappointed at that time) and I‚Äôm not that picky about chocolates .... I just eat whatever feels nice. She suggested we play TT again the next day. But honestly, I wasn‚Äôt feeling good anymore. For the first time, I didn‚Äôt call her to play.

She noticed. That day she even called me .... not directly about table tennis, but using a study-related excuse to start a conversation. I replied briefly and ended the call. By then, I had already noticed her talking to more guys lately, and one evening, when my friend and I were out for a walk after dinner, we saw her walking with Boy A. That‚Äôs when it hit me ‚Äî maybe she likes someone else. Maybe Boy A, or Boy B, or maybe someone else entirely‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I wasn‚Äôt angry; she has every right to like whoever she wants. I just wish she hadn‚Äôt done all those earlier things that made me feel like she liked me. Well‚Ä¶ maybe that‚Äôs my problem.

After that, I stopped initiating any messages, calling her for walks, or asking her to play TT. It‚Äôs not like I used to initiate messages much before, but now my replies became even shorter. She didn‚Äôt stop texting me, though ... mostly about studies couldn‚Äôt figure out if study was an excuse to talk to me.

One day, she asked me to go for a walk again. I hesitated. I knew it would probably just be about studies, but I couldn‚Äôt help wondering .... if she really likes someone else, why still walk with me at night? Anyway, I went. Nothing serious happened ‚Äî just the usual talk about studies and a few random topics. During the walk, she asked me to teach her a topic. I said she could come to my hostel and we could discuss it .... she had come before, after all. But this time she said she‚Äôd feel embarrassed to come to a boy‚Äôs hostel, though she would come to play TT, for which you have to enter the boys‚Äô hostel.

That confused me, because she has no problem calling me out for walks at night after 11 p.m. Even my friend was puzzled when I told him about it. But I‚Äôve noticed something: whenever she‚Äôs with me ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs during a walk or while playing TT ‚Äî she never mentions any other guy. She doesn‚Äôt talk about them at all. Her phone is always on silent when we‚Äôre together. Also, when she hands her phone to me to show a question or an assignment , she‚Äôll come really close while showing the screen. I can‚Äôt tell if she does that intentionally or not.

Also, over the past two months, I‚Äôve noticed her looking at me during class roughly one or two times. I can feel it when it happens. Even if I turn my eyes toward the professor or somewhere else, I can still sense she‚Äôs looking at me, even if just for a second or two.....not in every class, but it has happened enough times that I‚Äôve noticed.

**\[Last 1 month\]**

Well, she still stays with that same group during class ... I‚Äôve seen the three girls and those two boys, A and B, together most of the time. I haven‚Äôt really seen any other boys hang out with them (those 3 girls) that much. My friend once told me he saw her exchanging phone numbers with two other guys in class who aren‚Äôt from our batch....they were seniors maybe.. Maybe it was for study help or something academic, I‚Äôm not sure. Most of our seniors also know her ‚Äî she seems to talk to everyone and ask doubts quite openly. I honestly don‚Äôt know how many guys she talks to in her chats.

I mostly talked with her only among all the girls....usually when she initiates a message or says hello to me first ... like if we happened to see each other accidentally somewhere. I don‚Äôt really interact with other girls much since I don‚Äôt know them very well, but she was quite friendly with them. Interestingly, about a month and a half ago, she told me she wasn‚Äôt really able to fit in with those other two girls. We still don‚Äôt talk in front of anyone, and I had stopped calling her for TT or walks. Seven days went by .... no messages, no chats, no interaction at all, not even in person.

Then our midterms came. Before the first exam, I was having breakfast at the food court since I woke up late and missed the mess timing. I didn‚Äôt notice at first, but she was sitting on the next bench, having tea. We both saw each other ‚Äî not at the same time, though. Neither of us spoke at first. She even walked past me once, and finally, I said ‚Äòhi.‚Äô It felt like she had been waiting for that, because the moment I said it, she came and sat in front of me. We ended up talking for about an hour ‚Äî mostly about the next day‚Äôs exam, her family, and a few random things. Then we left.

Before the second exam, we didn‚Äôt talk at all. But on the night before the third exam (a subject she knew I was good at), she texted me, saying she was confused about what to read and needed some help. I told her I was stepping out of my room for a short walk to refresh my mind and asked if she wanted to join so we could discuss it. She agreed immediately.

When we met, she barely talked about the exam. Instead, she asked why I wasn‚Äôt attending classes I told her I preferred watching some advanced lectures online since the professor‚Äôs teaching wasn‚Äôt great...she never asked this before. She said she had caught a cold 2-3 days back...and went to the I mean she could have told me.... anyway I told to take care. At one point, she asked again if I was going home during the December break, and I told her I‚Äôd be staying on campus to learn a few things before the next term begins. She mentioned she would also be staying on campus during the December break. She even told me to wear a jacket or a tracksuit to avoid catching a cold like her.

Honestly, I was surprised as she had never done this before but not too surprised ‚Äî I felt she might be talking to others in the same way too....I mean that caring way.

Mid-terms ended, and then Diwali came. She went to her relatives‚Äô house ‚Äî I got to know because I had texted her for a walk that evening, and she said she wasn‚Äôt on campus. I didn‚Äôt say much, just told her to enjoy Diwali. The next day, she messaged me again. There were assignments due that day, and I had one sample file, so I sent it to her. She asked whether she should return to campus that day from her relative‚Äôs house. She even asked me what I was doing, to which I said that if she had her laptop with her, it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem to finish the assignments from there.

After about three days, she returned to campus. We didn‚Äôt talk much for a day or two after that. Then I began to notice something like she would message me about things she could easily find out from anyone else. Like, sometimes the professor had already mentioned in class which books to follow, yet she‚Äôd still ask me which book she should use for a particular topic, or some other small details she could‚Äôve confirmed with anyone.

Still, I always replied ...even if briefly. And I started noticing that the number of messages we exchanged was quite uneven. For every one short message I sent, she would send around five. If I look at it roughly, the total message ratio between us must be around (1098 : 629) (Hers: Mine)...believe me.. most of it was about studies....except those first 15 days.

The next day, she asked me to go for a walk again, saying she needed to understand something about two subjects for the final exam and how to prepare for them. Believe me, I‚Äôm not a topper but my grades are not bad ....I‚Äôm just confident in my specialized areas ....but I don‚Äôt understand why she always comes to me for help. Anyway, I said okay, and that night we went for another walk. We discussed her doubts for a while, and then she said, ‚ÄòYou didn‚Äôt come to class today ... I knew you wouldn‚Äôt. I was thinking, this guy definitely won‚Äôt come today either.‚Äô She told me again to wear jackets or I‚Äôd catch a cold. She also knew I was interested in pursuing a PhD after two years or so, and that night she mentioned she was also thinking about doing a PhD. That surprised me a little, because one or two months ago when I‚Äôd asked, she had said she wasn‚Äôt really interested in a PhD. Still, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. Also, that day she acted in a very childish way ‚Äî just like she used to during those first fifteen days after we met.

What did surprise me was that she remembered a small detail. I had once told her about a topic that took me four days to finish ‚Äî this was many days ago ‚Äî and she remembered not just the topic but even the number ‚Äòfour‚Äô....even I forgot that number. She told me not to waste too much time studying a single topic in such depth, saying it would be a waste of time. At the end of that walk, she mentioned another girl from our batch ‚Äî for the first time ever during our conversations. That girl hardly comes to class, but she knows her. Both of them seem to know each other, though she isn‚Äôt part of that usual group. I know that girl too, as we met coincidentally on a verification day and were lab partners once or twice...lab partners are decided by prof in a random way. This girl is even more introverted than I am, and whenever she sees me, she smiles and talks briefly. But there‚Äôs absolutely nothing between us. I really don‚Äôt know why she brought her up that day ... it felt random, and I couldn‚Äôt figure out the reason.

After two days, I texted her to play TT, and this time she replied instantly. Usually, she has this kind of ‚Äú10-minute rule‚Äù ‚Äî she always replies to me after exactly 10 minutes, and I‚Äôve also gotten used to doing the same. But that day, her reply came right away. She came, we played as usual, and while leaving, she suddenly asked whether I had been playing with someone else. I was honestly very surprised ‚Äî she had never asked anything like that before. I just said, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, because I really wasn‚Äôt playing with anyone else.

**That‚Äôs all.**

I never asked her anything about her past relationships or her social media accounts ‚Äî I felt I shouldn‚Äôt, and she never asked me either. There‚Äôs never been any physical contact between us, and I‚Äôve never told her things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to him‚Äù or anything like that. Even that day when I saw her in the evening with Boy A, I didn‚Äôt react...but I noticed one thing that boy A knows something like I was working on a particular problem...which I told her only. Maybe she discusses about me with that group or with the other girls..I don‚Äôt know. Nor do I care...I never told her anything very personal about me.

Most of the time, I am with my close friend ‚Äî she knows that too. My friend often tells me, after hearing everything, that if he were in my place, he would have already proposed to her by now. But I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe I am the dumb one here and one thing I forgot to mention whenever we go for a walk, she always asks me things like how she should manage her time, how to plan her studies, or how to read certain topics every time.

It‚Äôs just that, if the answer were yes, it would be great. But if it were no, I am afraid things might become awkward between us, or worse ‚Äî that it might spread among our batchmates, and I really don‚Äôt want that. So if you are still with me‚Ä¶ what do you think? Does she actually like me, or am I just a friend to her? It‚Äôs not that I am helping her to make her my girlfriend....I would help her anyway...its just that I will stop having any romantic thoughts/feelings for her if she sees me as just a friend.....

My husband and I have two children. A 3.5 year old and a newborn. Up until now, our older one wasn‚Äôt used to being without us + quite a lot to handle. After I got pregnant, we started getting her used to staying without us to prep her for the time we would have long appointments and during delivery time when we‚Äôll be in the hospital. One of the people she stayed with was my FIL and his second wife, my step MIL. 

My daughter went there for short durations with a trusted babysitter to help out because like I said, she‚Äôs a handful. 

Now ever since, anytime they make a plan to go out for lunch, coffee, dinner and we can‚Äôt make it - they ask us to send our daughter with them. The first time it happened, we were thinking of going out in the evening but I had a sudden (non-threatening) complication and was put on bed rest for a while. We live close by and we were over at their house. That‚Äôs the first time they suggested that even though we can‚Äôt make it, we can send our daughter with them. Since then, there have been a couple more such requests where we can‚Äôt get out so they ask us to send her over with them. We are also in a transition period of our older kid adjusting to new baby and obviously it‚Äôs not been easy. They suggested we send her over to their house for a few days. We obviously said no again because we need her to adjust to the new dynamics of our life.

We foresee that these requests are going to get more frequent - they‚Äôre gonna want to get out, we aren‚Äôt going to (at least for a bit till our newborn is 1.5-2 months old) so they‚Äôll ask for our older daughter to join them. My husband and I are uncomfortable with this request for 2 reasons:
1. Our daughter is wild and not easy to handle. They‚Äôre great at engaging her but have made a few questionable calls in the past. We can also send her with the babysitter but the babysitter isn‚Äôt comfortable with them, especially telling them off if they‚Äôre making questionable calls and they too, aren‚Äôt always sensitive to their domestic helps/staff.
2. It feels like they‚Äôre trying to not want us but just want our daughter. With my parents, I‚Äôve always seen it‚Äôs always about the family. If this situation happened with my parents, my parents would always understand and plan differently because they would want us too, unless of course it‚Äôs been a while that they met my daughter or they‚Äôre going somewhere she would love! But with them, it just feels like we‚Äôre invisible and they want to play happy family with her and they don‚Äôt look at us as a core family but rather her separately who can ping pong between us and them.

Both my husband and I come from a family where our grandparents played a very active part in our lives. We also don‚Äôt wish to be rude or unkind to my FIL.

1olpelq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1olpelq/aita_for_not_letting_my_partners_mom_crash_our/,AITA for not letting my partner‚Äôs mom crash our Halloween plans?,"(This is more of an are WE the assholes)

Yesterday, my partner and I (both 19) had big plans for Halloween. I‚Äôll call my partner Luke. We were planning on making a big dinner together and having a movie marathon after handing out candy to kids. Early in the day we get a text from my partner‚Äôs mom, who I‚Äôll call Mary. She says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be in (city 40 mins away from us) early this afternoon, do you want to come hang out with me?‚Äù Luke says no because he has lectures and has to work on a group project. She says ‚Äúoh ok, I‚Äôll see you then!‚Äù We figured that would just be the end of it. She lives 3 hours away from us but travels for work a lot and it‚Äôs not unheard of that she‚Äôd be in the area.

We go on with our day after that. Mid-afternoon when Luke is done with everything for University we go to the store to pick up stuff for dinner. We‚Äôd been cooking for about 2 hours when Mary calls us and says ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm coming over for dinner!‚Äù My partner says ‚Äúwe already have plans, sorry.‚Äù She says that she ‚Äúhates to pull the ‚Äòmom trump card,‚Äô‚Äù but that she‚Äôs coming anyways. 

I‚Äôm pissed if at that. We only bought food for two people! If we had known she was coming over earlier in the day when she first texted, we realistically could have gotten more food.

She gets to the house and dinner is like 30 minutes until done. The tension is palpable with me trying to make this food work for 3 people. When dinner is literally almost finished Mary says ‚ÄúHey Luke let‚Äôs go out and get some coffee and talk alone.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou mean right now‚Ä¶?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù
I stop and say ‚ÄúUm. We‚Äôre just about to eat. What about me?‚Äù
Mary says, ‚Äúyou can just keep it on keep warm.‚Äù

I can see Luke is visibly uncomfortable with leaving me alone, and he keeps looking at the food I‚Äôm making and back at me. So I finally get the memo and say. ‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not going to get coffee with you right now.‚Äù She says ‚Äúson, come on, it‚Äôll only be an hour.‚Äù And I again say ‚Äúno, we‚Äôre not going right now.‚Äù
I was about to suggest maybe going AFTER dinner if they wanted to talk alone but before we could talk she just yells ‚ÄúFine, I guess I‚Äôll just leave!‚Äù before slamming the door and leaving. She didn‚Äôt come back. 

Luke‚Äôs dad is pissed off at us. ‚ÄúShe never comes to visit, you see your girlfriend every day so what‚Äôs the big deal? If you went and talked with your mom it would have worked out in your favor. You‚Äôre young and should be able to change your plans.‚Äù

 Luke and I think it‚Äôs horribly rude to not consider our plans and availability. If we were younger, I get it. But we have school, work, and obligations now that we‚Äôre over 18. We can‚Äôt make everything work around her schedule. Also, even if we had no plans at all it‚Äôs rude to drop in unexpectedly on someone and demand food, especially on a big holiday. Finally, we were both HUNGRY. It was even MORE rude to say to me ‚Äújust wait another hour while we go and have coffee and a dessert alone.‚Äù

My partners dad said we‚Äôre acting like babies. Not to get overly salty but I think the baby move in this situation was to run out screaming instead of, you know, going out alone AFTER we ate‚Ä¶? Or at least asking why he didn‚Äôt want to go at that moment.

I do feel bad for hurting her feelings and making it feel like we don‚Äôt care about her. She has a history of being horribly clingy and sensitive around Luke after one of his sisters cut her off. I know she has it rough. But I was upset she crashed without us knowing and wanted to go out alone with my partner and leave me hanging.

I would like the opinion of parents and older adults especially. Our close friends our age say it‚Äôs not our fault but we‚Äôve had some older adults say it‚Äôs rude to reject a parent like that. ",17,1762007796.0,AITAH,27,0.96,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1olpe8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateIncelz/comments/1olpe8u/what_would_you_say_to_someone_who_has_tried_all/,"What would you say to someone who has tried all of your advices? I've tried going out, socialising, being nice, excercising with very little results. Do you believe everyone can succeed after my example of trying all your advices?","I know a lot of inkwells don't consider many of the normie advices like ""go out and meet new people"", ""be a nice person to everybody"", ""be funny and open"" because they think it's not going to work. They don't even begin to try because they think they know already they're ging to fail. I did the same for years, I spent most of my days alone in my bedroom doomscrolling without any human contact besides my family, although it's not like I had any opportunity to go out...

When I got my current job a few months ago  a lot has changed. Because I didn't want to be seen as a loser to the girl I liked and because I generally wanted to open up and improve my situation I tried opening up to people. A lot of times I initiated conversations which was unimaginable from me a few yeras ago. I took every opportunity I could to talk to people. I wasn't weird or awkward about it but it was things like whenever I knew someone was sick for a few days I asked them how they were, I tried helping others out with work, ask them questions of themselves and things like that. I did that because I genuinely cared and I also wanted to expand my social circle. I even went to some coffee breaks with some colleagues even though I don't rink coffee. I add a lot of colleagues as friends on Facebook when I have the opportunity. Sometimes I tried suggesting meeting outside of work.

Besides that I took every opportunity to attend every work related event that came up. Whether it was something related to my profession and job or it was a team biulding event, I was there. I got drunk and danced a few times which I've never done before. A made jokes and I was being myself and I talked a lot to people. I got invited to the footbal team, even though I can't play and tried to get closer to those colleagues as well, I got invited on the football training and friendly matches too.

Outside of work I try to attend every event or town festival that comes up although there's very little opportunity to talk to people on those. If I stumble upon a former classmate I try to talk to them and suggest having a drink sometime, I even talked to some of my old teachers or offered to invite them once somewhere with students that liked them so maybe this way I would have a chance to reconnect with some former classmates and friends.

I even tried joining a volunteer group. They're a local group of volunteers who patrol on the streets at night to try to catch criminals and call the police on any suspicious individuals.

I started working put a few weeks ago. It's nothing much, a few pushups, pullups and planks every day, 30 minutes a day at most. I know it's not enough for improvement yet but I also started losing weight because I eat less and get exposed to more stress since I work. I way never fat, more like skinny fat, but the recent weight loss was enough for people to notice already.

I will even try a psychologist at some point but she hasn't answered me yet.

What about the results? I did gain some results from all this. At work, I've found some people I really enjoy talking to and sometimes I have some opportunities to go out but that's it. I still have no people I can just call to hang out with besides my parents and grandmothers, what's even worse is I still don't have friends who I can talk a little deeper with and I'm even farther from getting a girlfriend.

At work it's mostly people twice as old as me and mostly no one wants to hang out outside of work anyways. I can go to the football trainings but it's also only guys, who are twice as old as me mostly, and have different personalities from mine, and there's no opporunity to meet new people there also. On the town festivals everyone (especially girls) have their own friend gropus to talk with already so there's no opportunity to talk with anyone there. The volunteer group is also people twice my age with very different personalities from mine.

How exactly is meeting new people supposed to work then? There's a deadline of options and opportunities and I feel like I've exhausted all of them. Normies say ""there's someone for everyone"" and ""you'll find a girl who loves you someday"" but how when I can't even meet them? There's no place for people my age to meet each other. If you don't have your old connections from high school you can't really meet anyone new which is the point most normies miss. It's all people twice my age with different personalities from mine who don't want to hang out with me anyway. I  thought of trying swimming also but the swimming pool is empty and the ticket is expesive. Even if it's not, it's one or two 60+ people.

This is somewhat an asking for advice but I also want to know how can you think it's just that easy as ""just go out""? I'm the living example of someone who has tried all that but still couldn't get any results. What advice would you give me now? At best I find some people I like talking to, at worst those people find me freaky. The girl I liked deleted my friend request on Facebook... You might say ""just keep doing what you're doing and never give up"" but as I said there's a deadline op people I can meet, eventually I'll run put of new people I can talk to at my job and no one want to hang out outside of work so no new opportunities to meet new poeple...

As you can see, contrary to some inkwells, I've tried everything you said despite doubting it works but I've still gotten no results. I will keep trying to cotinue but still... how exactly?

TL;DR: When I got my my current job a few months ago I started opening up and talking to poeple after years of NEETing, outside of work I took some opportunities to meet new people and reconnect with former classmates and I even tried joining a volunteer gruop and I try working out. Despite everything I try there's no opportunity to form deeper connections, let alone an opportunity to find a girl I like who likes me back. I want to know how normies think it's just as easy as ""just go out and meet new people and be nice"" and what advice they think would work now that I've tried all of them.",2,1762007774.0,DebateIncelz,6,0.67,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

The property's deed was transferred Wednesday from seller Arch to Park Equity Fund to MGA 4709 Delmar LLC, whose registered agent is Stock, according to state records.

The property will become the joint headquarters of Central West End-based law firm Stock Legal and Legal Back Office, which is based in south St. Louis County and provides management services for law firms. Both businesses are led by Sara Stock.

The firm said it plans to create an $8 million mixed-use redevelopment at the 4709 Delmar site, which is set to include leasable retail space for stores, restaurants and coffee shops, as well as creative offices and a gym. It will also be home to Counselor's Collective, a 6,000-square-foot legal coworking space.

Construction began on Wednesday and is expected to take 18 to 24 months to complete.

The 4709 Delmar Blvd. building has been vacant for five years, according to the law firm. Built in 1926, it is the former headquarters and factory of Mavrakos Candy Co., once the area's largest chocolate company with 18 retail locations and over 60 franchises in four states at its height. The Mavrakos brand is now owned by Dan Abel and his family, the owners of Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Co.",11,1762007496.0,StLouis,0,1.0,False

A member of the Power Pack, [Alexander Power](https://imgur.com/d3oTDxZ) is the oldest child out of his siblings. Given powers by Aelfyre Whitemane alongside his other siblings after their parents would be kidnapped by aliens, Alex would gain the power of gravity, allowing him to either decrease, increase or do other things with gravity in mind. 

Alongside his siblings, they would fight against a wide variety of threats and go to a wide variety of locations, alongside fighting alongside other heroes such as Iron Man, Wolverine, and even the Fantastic Four.

'Til even the outside world looks great


In hi-tech science research labs
It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated disease injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore

Which area is Juneau would you say is best for a young family? 

We‚Äôre hoping for somewhere: 
- safe, 
- has easy access to hiking trails, walking trails or nature, 
- close to public transportation, 
- a big perk if walkable. Ie: walking distance to a park, library, coffee shops, restaurants, grocery, etc. 

Some areas we‚Äôre looking into are:
1. Lemon Creek
2. Auk Bay
3. Downtown Juneau
4. Douglas 
5. Mendenhall (husband works at airport)

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1olozi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1olozi4/why_would_friends_behaviour_change_all_of_a_sudden/,Why would friend‚Äôs behaviour change all of a sudden?,"Hi, to preface this whole thing - I have a lot of trouble deciphering certain behaviours of others, especially when it comes to possible romantic or sexual interest, which is why I need someone else‚Äôs input to maybe better understand what could be going on.

I (25F) have a friend (27M) and we‚Äôve been friends for years, about 6-7. I‚Äôve developed a liking to him at the beginning, but quickly realized he‚Äôs a flirt and not interested in me, which I accepted later on and stopped worrying about it - so we remained friends. We‚Äôve had that kind of friendship when we‚Äôd still be somewhat invested in each other‚Äôs lives but never really spent too much time together, we‚Äôd meet few times a year, sometimes we‚Äôd just run into each other, less often actually planned something together. 

Now this year something changed. Me and my friend (F) went on a trip and happened to travel through his home town, where he was spending his summer, so we paid him a visit. Some of my long forgotten emotions resurfaced and (which I attribute to quite shitty period of my life, among other things) I could hardly recognize him. He was like a different person, in a good sense. Never did he treat me with such warmness and openness before, it was a bit shocking. He was more touchy, more flirty than usual, more attentive. I tried not to pay too much attention to it, knowing how he tends to be. 

So once we parted ways, I expected things to be the same as always - we‚Äôd meet some six months later for a coffee, catch up on our lives and continue the friendship as always. Instead, he all of a sudden decided to include me in his life, in a lot of his private affairs, family issues - he opened up to me in a way he never did before. Once he returned from his hometown, we‚Äôve been in touch practically daily, he invited me to his place, we talked, planned some activities together, had fun - it was (and still is) really nice, since I‚Äôve always enjoyed him as a person. 

The thing is, I‚Äôve been wondering what‚Äôs behind that sudden change of heart? I know it‚Äôs hard to gauge from this much information, but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking you guys, if that ever happened to you and what was behind it? I would lie if I said I wasn‚Äôt interested in him, though I‚Äôm very much at peace with keeping him as a friend, he‚Äôs very dear to me. It‚Äôs just very confusing, on one hand he opens up like this, wants to spend time together but then also talks about women he‚Äôs dating and stuff like that. I wish I could read men better so I didn‚Äôt have to turn to internet, but here we are. So, do any of you have the same experience of something changing in you after years of friendship? In any way? What was driving that change? Or was there something all along and you maybe just decided to give a chance to a different perspective? Any kind of similar experience would help me a lot to gain an insight, thanks!!
P.S.: he‚Äôs had a GF for years and broke up with her at the beginning of this year, so he‚Äôs single now, fyi

about me: early 20s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. i‚Äôve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i‚Äôm new to dating but ready to try.

why i‚Äôm here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i‚Äôm looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i‚Äôm about:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk, i love hearing how things... and people... work.

deep talks > small talk, tell me about your passions, not just your day

not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills

what i‚Äôm looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don‚Äôt have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i‚Äôll respect your worldview and i‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won‚Äôt match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm after.

beyond that, consistency and matched energy are HUGE for me. I'm looking for someone whose actions actually line up with their words. If you're a clear communicator who believes in showing up, not just showing interest, we'll get along great

and a quick heads-up on my communication style:

im a very direct person because I value clarity and honesty above everything. you can expect me to ask real questions early on, because I'm here to build a genuine connection, not just stay in shallow small talk. It's never to be uncomfortable, but always to be clear.

i‚Äôd rather hear ""hey this isn't a vibe"" than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion. let's RESPECT each other's time.

but also, if you're someone who just drops a ""hey"", trades a few surface-level messages, and bails before even trying to know the person, please don't bother texting. at that point, saying ""this isn't a vibe"" is just lazy, because you haven't even understood the words yet, let alone the vibe. i'm not here to be someone's pass-time or validation hit. i value real effort, real curiosity, and actual presence. if you can‚Äôt bring that, it‚Äôs perfectly okay... but this space isn‚Äôt for you.

ambiguity is fine, but only when it's honest. An upfront ""hey, I'm not sure yet"" is a thousand times better than mixed signals or a slow fade. i'll always give you that same respect and directness in return... overall, i‚Äôm not here to impress, i‚Äôm here to express

so, if you've actually read this far and you're on the same page, please send a DM. I'm not against 'hi', but to show you get the vibe, PLEASE SKIP THE INTRO and instead tell me TWO things: your ideal lazy weekend, and one song you've had on repeat lately.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Looking to get to know you over the course of a few dates - possibly a coffee date or going out for dinner.

A little bit about me... I'm a hard-working, single guy with a great job, my own place, a car, a furbaby (cat), and some extra time to date. I'm passionate about healthy living, exercising, good conversation, music (80s and 90s pop, 90s rap, metal & classic rock), board games, video games, card games, movies (huge fan of horror, action and comedy movies) and outdoorsy activities. I'm family oriented and would love to have a big, fat, happy family one day. I love to socialize, drink (only really socially), go out to bars, do karaoke and play board games in groups. Also a big fan of arcade bars.

Realistically I'm looking for someone who I can trust in and someone who wants to be able to rely on and trust. I'm very loyal, crave communication, I'm emotionally available and would appreciate someone who is as well. I want to really get to know everything about you and develop a real¬†*monogamous*¬†relationship. I go to the gym regularly and I'm in pretty decent shape. Wouldn't mind if you also lift & do cardio like me so we can even work out at the gym together.

I'm of European descent (Mediterranean and English) but was born and raised here in Toronto. I'm average height - 5'9"", handsome, confident, intelligent, have brown hair and hazel eyes. I have a heart-warming smile and love to smile, make others smile and spread joy & good vibes. I like to think of myself as being harmonious, lovable and interesting to be around.

I prefer ladies who are in shape (not a dealbreaker), have a nice smile, are independent. have a good job and in general take good care of themselves. I'm emotionally intelligent and want someone to be able to care of who is capable of taking good care of me in return!

1olow0u,https://i.redd.it/til4hbfwlnyf1.jpeg,Heading Out For the Day - or Longer? Here's a Checklist for Reducing Your Home's Environmental Impact While You're Away,"For the Day:

Lights & Fans: Turn off all lights and ceiling fans when you leave a room or the house.

Thermostat: Adjust your thermostat to an energy-saving temperature. In summer, set it a few degrees higher; in winter, a few degrees lower (e.g., to 68¬∞F or lower). A smart thermostat allows you to control this remotely.

Unplug ""Energy Vampires"": Unplug small electronics and chargers that draw power even when not in use (standby power). This includes coffee makers, toasters, blenders, TVs, computers, and phone chargers.

Water: Ensure all taps are turned off and fix any running leaks or drips.

Windows/Curtains: Close blinds and curtains in the summer to block heat gain from the sun, reducing the need for AC. In winter, open curtains on sunny days to capture passive solar warmth.


For Longer Stays Away:

Thermostat: Set your thermostat to ""vacation mode"" or to a more extreme but safe temperature (e.g., 55¬∞F in winter to prevent frozen pipes, and around 78¬∞F or higher in summer to reduce cooling costs while avoiding excessive heat buildup).

Water Heater: Switch your water heater to ""vacation mode"" or turn the temperature dial to ""low"" to avoid heating water that won't be used.

Refrigerator/Freezer: Plan meals to eat all perishables before you leave. Unplug the fridge only for very long trips (over a month), in which case it should be emptied and the door propped open to prevent mold.

Lights on Timers: Use light timers or smart plugs on a few lights to simulate occupancy for security while ensuring most lights are off to conserve energy.

Main Water Supply (Optional): Consider shutting off the main water supply to the house, which can prevent major water damage from a burst pipe or leak while you are gone.",1,1762006483.0,INFPIdeas,0,1.0,False
