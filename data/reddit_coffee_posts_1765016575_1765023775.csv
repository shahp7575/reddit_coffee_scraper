STICK WITH YOUR TEAM. I cannot stress how much teamwork is a part of this game, if you run off by yourself, its basically telling the killer ""HEY, COME KILL ME, IM SO FREE!""  
2. if you are a sentinel, leave the generators to the survivalists and supports, as they have perks and passives that make them stronger by doing them.  
3. As a killer, focus on one survivor. by constantly shifting targets, you give the survivors time to heal and regroup.  
4. As a killer, Focus on survivors in this order : Supports, Survivalists, Sentinels, as an Elliot main, so many people I have played against have lost a round because they allowed a support to complete their objectives, which makes them stronger. (Please correct me if I am wrong here)  
5. Use survivors and killers to their strengths - For example - John Doe - He is a trapper, and excels at cutting off key areas to survivors.  
6. as a survivor, USE LOOPING SPOTS! it may seem like a cheap tactic, but in a game where you are pretty much a sheep against a wolf, sometimes, running in circles is the best thing you can do.

This is pretty much all I can think of, as I am running on coffee and spite, so feel free to add/make notes on my list!",1,1765023633.0,FORSAKENROBLOX,1,1.0,False

One reason I've joined is to be more proactive about building a community through readership. Yes, I'm an author, but I'm not here to promote books. I'm more interested in creating and sharing spaces where we can come together and celebrate literacy. Having worked as a professional author since 2010, I've seen many changes in the publishing industry and still have to confront two common myths: that Black people don't buy books, and that young Black people definitely don't. I've never believed this, but often some spaces don't serve us well, like many bookstores here in Los Angeles. That's why I've had few events in bookstores and instead choose to hold events at small businesses, such as coffee shops and cafes. I'd love to hear people's ideas on where book events could be more impactful in community-focused locations.

Then I crashed hard. Couldn't get out of bed. Couldn't focus. Couldn't feel anything except empty. That's when I realized ""manning up"" was killing me.

Here's what actually helped when nothing else did:

1. Depression doesn't look like sadness for men I wasn't crying or feeling sad. I was angry, numb, and exhausted all the time. Slept 12 hours and still felt drained. Snapped at everyone. Stopped caring about things I used to love. That's what male depression actually looks like.

Recognize it: Constant irritability, no energy, loss of interest in hobbies, feeling nothing instead of feeling sad. If that's you, it's not weakness - it's a real problem that needs real help.

2. Talking doesn't make you less of a man I thought therapy was for people who couldn't handle life. Then I went and realized it's for people smart enough to get help before they break completely. Best decision I ever made. My therapist gave me actual tools, not just ""cheer up"" BS.

Start here: Find a therapist who specializes in men's issues. One session. That's all you commit to. If it helps, keep going. If not, try a different one. Shop around like you would for anything else important.

3. Your body holds trauma you don't remember I had panic attacks I couldn't explain. Tight chest, couldn't breathe, felt like dying. Turns out stress from years of ""toughing it out"" was stored in my nervous system. Talk therapy helped my mind. Breathwork and exercise helped my body.

Try this: When anxiety hits, do 20 push-ups or run for 2 minutes. Burn off the adrenaline physically. Your body needs to discharge the stress it's holding.

4. Isolation makes everything worse I pulled away from friends because I didn't want to burden them. Big mistake. The more alone I got, the darker my thoughts became. Men are taught to be independent but isolation during mental health struggles is dangerous.

Action step: Text one friend this week. Say ""I've been struggling lately, can we grab coffee?"" You don't have to dump everything on them. Just connect. Humans need humans.

5. Mental health isn't about ""fixing"" yourself I kept waiting to be ""fixed"" so I could start living again. Wrong approach. You manage mental health, you don't cure it. Some days are good. Some are hard. That's normal. Tools help you navigate the hard days better.

Daily practice: Rate your mental state 1-10 each morning. Below 5? Use your tools (breathwork, call someone, go outside, move your body). Track patterns. Know your warning signs.

6. You're not broken, your coping methods are I ""handled"" stress with alcohol, overworking, porn, and anger. Those aren't coping - they're avoidance. I needed actual skills: setting boundaries, processing emotions, asking for what I need, resting without guilt.

Learn these: How to identify what you're feeling (mad/sad/scared/hurt), how to communicate needs without aggression, how to rest without feeling lazy, how to ask for help directly.

The daily mental health routine that saved me:

Morning: 10-minute walk outside (sunlight + movement) Midday: Check in with myself (Am I okay? What do I need?) Evening: One thing that brings joy (music, cooking, gaming, whatever) Night: Journal 3 sentences about the day

Your mental health matters just as much as your physical health. Ignoring it doesn't make you strong - it makes you a ticking time bomb.

Get help before you break. Future you will thank you.

A Saturday Morning Story

Shirley liked Saturday mornings.

They were quiet, soft, and warm — the kind of morning where sunlight sits politely on the table and nobody rushes her to finish her breakfast. She sat with her bowl of regular Cheerios, swinging her feet, humming a song she’d invented five minutes ago.

She lifted her spoon.

A single Cheerio slipped off, bounced twice on the table, and landed upright like a tiny halo.

And then she heard it.

A voice.
Deep.
Ancient.
Volcanic.

“I SEE YOU.”

Shirley froze.
The spoon hovered in mid-air.

The Cheerio glowed faintly, its edges pulsing like molten gold.

“YOU CANNOT HIDE, CHILD OF MAN.”

Shirley dropped the spoon. It clattered against the bowl like a sword hitting stone.

Her little brother, Jamie, looked up from across the table, a Cheerio stuck to his cheek.

“Shirwee… why ith your cereal talking?”

Shirley didn’t answer.
She was too busy staring into the glowing oat-circle that had become her entire reality.

The Great Eye opened.

Right there in the middle of the Cheerio.

A lidless, burning eye — swirling like a storm over a microwave.

“ONE BREAKFAST TO RULE THEM ALL.”

The air trembled.

Jamie whimpered.
Shirley swallowed hard.

“M… mom?”

Silence.

The Cheerio rotated on its edge without being touched — like a possessed coin deciding someone’s fate.

“MOOOOOOM.”

Footsteps.

And then Mom appeared in the doorway, holding coffee and wearing the dead expression of someone who has survived too many mornings with children.

But from Mom’s perspective?

Everything was normal.

No glowing.
No voice.
No doom.
Just a bowl of perfectly boring breakfast cereal.

She blinked.

Mom:
“…why are you two acting like the toaster threatened you again?”

Shirley pointed one shaking finger at the bowl.

Shirley:
“Mom…
these Cheerios are weird.”

The Cheerio, now perfectly still, looked as harmless as a button.

Mom sighed.

Mom:
“Sweetheart. It’s cereal.”

Jamie whispered,
“He said he can thee my thoul…”

The Cheerio didn’t move. Didn’t glow. Didn’t rumble.

Just floated there in the milk like a liar.

Shirley leaned close to Mom and whispered urgently:

“Can we please buy the apple cinnamon ones next time?
These ones are… possessed.”

Mom rubbed her face.

Mom:
“Okay. Sure. Apple cinnamon. Can we all relax now?”

She turned to refill her coffee.

Behind her, completely unnoticed, the Cheerio rotated one final time — a slow, ominous spin.

A faint whisper drifted across the table, heard only by Shirley:

“I am not yet defeated…”

Shirley shoved the bowl away and stood up.

Shirley:
“I’m having toast.”

Jamie nodded in agreement and backed away from the table like the bowl might bite him.

Mom sat down, sipping her coffee, oblivious.

And the Cheerio floated silently in the milk…
watching…
waiting…
plotting the rise of the Breakfast Realm.

When we started dating, everything was just wonderful. We got along great, and we had a lot of fun together. So much so that I decided to move closer to her, and she suggested that we move in together since we’ll be spending most of our time at each other’s house anyway. Reluctant, I said okay. What’s the worst that could happen?

I was dead wrong.

When we moved in, everything was to be done exactly her way or she would have a meltdown. From the way I would cook to the way I would clean. Everything was very specific. I didn’t mind it at first because I figured everyone has their thing and I was willing to make adjustments.

There were things that I used to do because I was trying to be romantic that ended up becoming expected. For example, I would wake up the same time she did so we could have coffee before she would go to work. Eventually, she would be screaming at the top of her lungs because I did not make her coffee. She would turn on the lights in our bedroom to wake me to make me make her coffee no matter how exhausted I was from work the night before. Stuff like that began to pile up.

The next thing was her son. Her son is an adult who lives with her. Prior to moving in together, I said that I was not comfortable feeding another adult in the house unless he has a job. I raised this many times and she would get so mad and say awful things to me. I let it go. 8 months later, he still had no job and would steal from me.

Then her mother was dying of cancer. The doctor told us that she had weeks, if not days, left to live. She immediately took off work, turned to me and said, “will you support me and the kids?” I felt cornered, but I said yes because of the situation.

Then her son’s friend moves in to our house without so much as letting me or her know. This adult also has no job. Then, she casually says to me one day that her sister is moving in with us. Did not ask me if I was ok with it. Her sister had a child and a BD who also did not work. I was feeding a total of 7 people with one paycheck.

All this stress caused me to be hospitalized twice in 3 months in a psych ward.

It got so ugly that at one point she told me that everyone was mad at me and that I had to apologize to everyone. She said I had no right to come between her and her family. And I said if that’s how she sees it, then I should just leave.

And I left the house with all my clothes and my cat. We drove 14 hours away to my aunt who was more than willing to help me out until I figured my life out.

Upon having a lengthy conversation with her and my friends, they essentially said that I was being used for my money and now I’m the one without a house. But in my heart, I know she has no money. If I left them, they would have nowhere else to go.
But at the same time, aren’t I just enabling the abuse?

Thanks for any advice anyone will give.",2,1765022301.0,AITA_Relationships,2,1.0,False

1pfnmc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaTravel/comments/1pfnmc7/customs_shells_souvenirs/,Customs - shells & souvenirs,"Hi everyone, 

I am slightly scarred from watching Aussie border control TV as a kid 😂😭 I’m wondering if I can bring souvenir shells and coffee beans into the country? 
I have been backpacking for a few months and collecting shells from beaches I’ve been to (in countries it’s legal to take them out of the country). The last stop on my backpacking trip is Australia. I looked on the government website and it seems like if the shells are well cleaned, there may not be an issue. None of them as far as I know are considered rare or exotic. They’re all small ones from the beach and definitely have no creatures inside! Should I declare these to customs? If I do or don’t, what’s the worst that can happen? I don’t want to receive a massive fine or jail or something over some beach shells, I’d rather not take them at all. I was worried if they don’t see them as I enter the country, maybe they will when I leave and they might think I’m taking them from Australia. Which I definitely won’t do as I know it’s illegal. 
I was also considering buying a friend a gift of local coffee beans from Vietnam but again, will I be allowed to take these in or not? 
In my head they’re super strict at the border but Reddit says people have mixed experience especially with shells.

I am based in Dubai, and I am looking for one (or more) solid salesperson to join me on a small B2B side hustle that can grow into a proper business. 

This is simple and old school. We sell already-manufactured physical products from manufacturers to retailers and companies here in the UAE. Think classic distribution and sales, not selling courses, not dropshipping, not any “get rich quick” stuff. 

We work as sales agents between manufacturers and retailers. If things go well, we can grow into a proper distributor model. You can also join as a partner on the trade license. I am open to sharing upside with the right person, not just paying commissions. 

Important note  
There is real work and real risk here. No guaranteed salary at the beginning. You must be comfortable with:  
• Investing time consistently  
• Putting in some initial effort and small capital where needed  
• Handling rejection and slow months  
• Building something small that can grow over time.

What you should bring  
• Based in Dubai and able to meet clients in person  
• Previous experience in sales, preferably B2B or field sales  
• Good English. Arabic, Farsi, Hindi/Urdu, or other languages are a plus  
• Comfortable doing cold calls, walk-ins, and follow-ups  
• Understands basic numbers, margins, and profit sharing  
• Honest, reliable, and serious about building a side business, not just “trying for a week.”

What I bring  
• Existing product line and supplier relationships  
• Knowledge of the local market  
• Clear margin structure and fair profit sharing  
• Someone who actually works and does not disappear

Money side  
There is decent money in this if we both push. It will not make you rich in one month. It can become a strong side income and later a full-time thing if we scale it.

If you are in Dubai, have real sales experience, and want to build something small but serious, send me a DM with  
• Short intro about you  
• Your sales background  
• Your current job situation  
• Why does this kind of physical product sales interest you?

He meets her over coffee,
Forcing himself to open up slowly,

Smiling,talking,listening half heartedly,
His mind wishing if he could just be with a different lady.

Someone walks in and he glances,
Her long hair, her blue glasses,

Reminds him in bits and pieces,
Realising it's not her, 
he sighs inwardly and dismisses,

The conversation ends, he is happy to leave,
Eager to be alone with his memories,

No more pretense, he finally is free,,
He can now remember, dream and think about her in peace.

1pfnjw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1pfnjw3/mitrial_valve_prolapse/,Mitrial valve prolapse,"I have mitrial valve prolapse. Recently had a checkup.  My ecg came back abnormal but the cardiologist didn't seem concerned. I have sinus arrythmia too. He literally crossed out the part that said I was having a heart attack, so that was concerning. I'm awaiting an echo. 39 yo male, very active. All lipids normal. All labs normal. In the office my sbp was high (152) but I know it was white coat syndrome. Ive been nervous at physicians offices ever since I was misdiagnosed a year ago for something else.

He was cautious about the blood pressure so Ive take it upon myself to buy an electronic cuff and monitor it myself daily. The average has been about 110/70 , so I'm glad that's in check. However in doing this I've noticed my pulse measurements are often below 60 at rest. One morning was 48 and is often in the 50s. If I'm up walking around it'll be around 72. When I exercise I go around 130, but I've been slightly concerned about my pulse being low. I'm not sure if it's something to brag about or be concerned about. 

Now I've been treadmill walking daily for about a year now. I do about 3 miles a day most days around 3.5 to 4 mph. I started doing this because of my back issues, not cardiac issues. It's about 48, 52 mins a day.  I also have a rather physical job. I get about 16k steps a day up to about 22k. Maybe around 8 k on a lazy Sunday. 

I quit coffee because I know it messes with NO and blood vessel dialation. I eat close to zero processed sugar.

I have no symptoms that are unusual for me. I say unusual because I do have some anxiety so I'll get sometimes a faster beating heart when I'm out and about, especially socially. 

I never monitored my pulse before so I don't know my baseline. Should I be concerned about a pulse in 50s, high 40s ? Or is it likely just that all that walking has lowered it. The lowest it's been was early in the morning after waking up or when I'm super focused mentally on something (like after meditation).

Currently here's my problem.
At the age of 11 or 12 I got addicted to porn and masterbation. Ever since that age it stayed consistent with me.
 I was a teatotler before not even tea or coffee.
At the age of 20 I used coffe .
Coffee become something that made me happy. I got hooked with it extremely cause porn and masterbation got more pleasurable. 
Then around 1 year after only using coffe . I got super tolerated to it. I chased for more . I discovered Cannabis. And got super hooked to it. Later I got addicted to ciggerates heavily. Used alcohol here and there. Did it heavily for a year.
Cannabis, ciggerates and coffe. It made me discontinue my college basically taking drop year from college.
I stayed home for a year and stayed addicted to substances.
Later tried to join college but still due to addiction couldn't.
And stayed addicted and couldn't continue education and studies. It's been like this for 2 years ever since. Now I am also doing alprazolam here and there which I am shit scared of presently. I want advice from anyone who recovered from this situation  ?",1,1765021856.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

1pfnfvb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pfnfvb,"THREAD 🧵: CME “Daily Delivery Notices” aren’t boring PDFs.

They’re the receipt printer of the real metal market.
If you’re a stacker, this is where you look — not at the squiggly price line.
X post By Honza Černý
@honzacern1","First rule: “STOPPED” = someone took delivery.  
That’s the line where paper turns into physical.  
Second rule: “ISSUED = delivered out.”  
  
So when big names are stopping… they’re not “trading.” They’re loading the truck.

On this report, the headline isn’t one metal.  
It’s the pattern across metals:  
 Gold  
  Copper  
  Silver  
  Palladium  
When the same class of institutions is taking everything, that’s not a coincidence. That’s a posture.

Gold was a crowd scene.  
You’ve got names like JPM, Standard Chartered, Scotia, BofA, Barclays, RBCinvolved on the STOPPED side.  
  
That’s not “retail FOMO.”  
That’s “we’d like our metal… in our name… now.”

And the mechanics matter: Issued ≈ Stopped (1:1) on the day.  
  
Translation: whatever got issued… got vacuumed up.  
No “meh” demand. No leftover. No slack.  
Just: deliver it, I’ll take it.

JPM is doing JPM things: issuing and stopping in size (in gold).  
  
That often looks like internal reshuffling (house vs client, account-to-account, warehouse category juggling).  
  
It’s the financial equivalent of:  
“I’m not moving furniture… I’m just rearranging the safe.” 

Now look at Copper.  
  
You see firms like Macquarie, Marex, Mizuho showing up.  
  
Copper delivery appetite alongside gold/silver is a big tell:  
  
This isn’t just “inflation hedge culture.”  
It’s industrial + monetary hedging at once.

 Silver (5,000 oz contracts) is where stackers should zoom in — and not just for the total.  
  
The key is WHO is stopping.

Notable STOPPED on silver includes HSBC (and other major houses taking pieces).  
  
When systemically important firms take delivery, it’s a signal:  
  
They don’t want “exposure.”  
They want possession.  
(Yes, that old meme is still true. Sorry, not sorry.)

Here’s what jumps out to me:  
You don’t see a big “flood” of silver being issued by the usual suspects.  
  
You see more taking than distributing.  
That’s the opposite of “yeah sure, plenty of metal, nobody wants it.”  
  
That’s “we’re not parting with it.”

And then there’s Palladium — smaller numbers, but the same vibe:  
  
institutions still show up to take physical.  
  
When multiplemetals see steady delivery interest, it screams:  
  
“Hard stuff > promises.”

Stacker translation:  
  
If banks & big brokers are consistently active on the STOPPED side, they’re quietly telling you they value physical optionality right now.  
  
Because when stress hits, the most expensive asset in the world is:  
 the one you can’t source.

So what does it “mean” for stackers?  
  
Not “tomorrow moon.”  
Not wild price targets.  
  
Just a simple reality:  
The grown-ups are securing metal across the complex.  
  
And you’re over here stacking with a coffee and a meme.  
  
Who’s the crazy one now? 

Watch this going forward:  
  
repeated appearances of the same big names on STOPPED shrinking willingness to ISSUE  
activity spreading across metals  
elevated “month-to-date” delivery tempo  
  
That combination is how scarcity shows up before it screams in price.

Final thought:  
  
Price is a narrative.  
Deliveries are logistics.  
And logistics don’t care about opinions.

I’m a developer based in India. I noticed that most local coffee shops and restaurants here have great food but terrible customer retention. They rely entirely on footfall or expensive ads (Zomato/Swiggy).
I spent the last week building a ""Silent Manager"" system to fix this.
The concept is simple:
Customer scans a QR at the table (no app download).
They rate the food.
If they rate 5 stars, the system automatically texts them a ""Manager's Special"" coupon via WhatsApp if they haven't visited in 7 days.
If they rate 1 star, an AI reads their complaint and drafts a personalized apology instantly to stop them from posting a bad Google Review.

Is this something you would actually pay for? Or is it too complicated?

Now reviews of the 078 say (1) it was overhyped -which I don't worry about too much,  (2) that it produces similar outcomes at a range of grind sizes-in other words always good but not differentiated, and (3) that it's better for ""softening""  naturals, anaerobics, and co-ferments than it is for washed (which I can understand from experience). 

The Ode is proving as hard to dial in with SSPs as many had opined before I changed burrs.

\-Are my grinders now too similar to be a reasonable combo?

\-Should I go back to stock burrs in the Ode?

\-Are either or both of these grinders too ""special purpose"" as set up? I'm getting sick of dialing. Is there one grinder, that is generally excellent-electric-under $2000-well supported that would be more than 10% better alone?

1pfn6rk,https://testflight.apple.com/join/UpBJ4BGX,Lång – for people who check their balance and wonder if it’ll last,"I’ve been trying to solve my own day-to-day spending uncertainty for nearly 15 years – checking my balance, doing rough maths, wondering whether the money would last. Started with spreadsheets and monthly targets, then burn-down charts, then daily amounts.

Eventually built an iOS app that shows what’s okay to spend today, based on what you have left after bills until next payday. Six people have used it for over eight months now, checking in most days. They’re all from my social network – some close friends, others acquaintances. I need to see if it works for strangers.

**For you if:**

* You already pace your spending by feel – checking your balance, rough mental division, ’will this last until payday?’
* You dislike category breakdowns because they feel like high-maintenance busywork or create guilt.
* You have some discretionary slack – not in crisis mode.
* You want a clearer sense of what’s okay to spend today, not full financial planning.

**Not for you if:**

* You want to track everything (bills, rent, loans, subscriptions).
* You want category budgets or detailed breakdowns.
* You’re in crisis-budget mode.
* You expect a whole-economy view.

**Important:**

* This is only for day-to-day spending – groceries, coffee, going out, shopping.
* Rent, loans and bills stay outside.
* You enter what’s available for daily stuff, not your total balance.
* If fixed costs get included, the daily guidance won’t work.

**What to expect:**

* Most people check in most days.
* You log spending manually – quick amounts, no categories.
* Some log right after purchases, others in the evening.
* There are no bank connections.
* It gives you a daily amount for discretionary spending and adjusts as your spending varies.
* It can take a couple of weeks before it feels natural.

I’m trying to validate whether the boundary is clear to strangers (what goes in vs stays out), whether the daily amount feels believable, and what makes people bounce off early. If you stop after a few days, that’s still useful – I’d like to know why.

If this sounds like how you already handle daily spending, I’d be interested in how it works for you.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I’m sitting here, coffee in hand, scrolling through my Phemex dashboard, and I can’t help but grin like an idiot. You know that feeling when an exchange drops a competition that’s not just another “trade to earn” gimmick, but a legit arena where you can flex your futures game and walk away with real bags? 

A whopping $450K USDT prize pool, slices where 100 of us grinders split 2,000 USDT based on pure trading volume. To me, it feels like they’re handing out rocket fuel for anyone who’s been itching to scale up their perps plays without the usual FOMO tax.

But here’s where my brain really lights up: 

— This event isn’t happening in a vacuum. I’ve been watching how centralized exchanges like Phemex are straight-up championing the Perp DEX wave, and to me, it’s one of the smartest ecosystem plays we’ve seen in years. 

—Think about it, Perp DEXes are blowing up because they blend the speed and leverage of CEX perps with the trustless magic of DeFi. 

—No KYC nightmares, self-custody vibes, and funding rates that actually make sense without some shady custodian in the middle. 

—Exchanges promoting this is a total win-win. On one side, they’re bridging their massive liquidity pools to on-chain action, pulling in DeFi natives who’ve been skeptical of centralized rails. On the flip, it grows the pie for everyone.

— More volume means deeper markets, tighter spreads, and innovations like zk-proofs or intent-based trading that trickle back to CEX tools.

I mean, call me optimistic, but I feel like this is how we escape the siloed that’s held crypto back. And competitors  are already leaning in hard:

• MetaMask just rolled out their perpetual DEX with a points program that’s got everyone farming like it’s 2021 all over again.
• Lighter’s crushing $10B+ daily volumes as the top dog, and Astros is gunning for Sui’s slice of the pie. 

It’s interesting in the best way, pushing the whole sector toward hybrid models where CEX liquidity feeds DEX rails seamlessly.

Now Phemex!! I’m dying to know if they’re cooking something similar under the hood. They’ve been killing it with pre-market perps and zero-fee weeks, so in my head, a Perp DEX integration feels like the natural next step – maybe tying Apex events to on-chain leaderboards or cross-chain leverage. If they’re not already plotting it, they should be, because this ecosystem growth isn’t optional anymore; it’s survival.


So yeah, I’m hyped, I’m entered, and I’m sharing this because events like Apex remind me why Phemex feels like home base in this wild market. ",3,1765020308.0,phemex_global,2,1.0,False

I have a Porlex hand grinder, had it for 10 years and found it recently. Is it worth reserving the DF for normal coffee and using a hand grinder for decaf (and aeropress) coffee? If it's worth using a hand grinder for decaf but using a different one - would welcome a view on what hand grinder would do the job.

*By Stub Froth — November 30, 2025* 

There are a handful of universal truths left in modern life. Gravity works. Coffee tastes better when someone else makes it. And no man alive — not one — has *any idea* who he’s actually talking to anymore.

This was the gist of a question a friend asked me yesterday, half serious, half exhausted, fully confused:  
“How the hell is a guy supposed to know if he’s talking to a woman or a man anymore?”

Not politically. Not philosophically. Just… physically. In the wild. In the apps. In the grocery aisle. At the gym. At Thanksgiving. On the street. Anywhere. Ever.

And my answer — the one that shot out before my brain had time to dress it up — was simple:

“Check their knees and their knuckles. Dead giveaway.”

That’s it.  
The whole diagnostic tool.  
Two joints away from truth.

No app needed. No user manual. No therapist. No biometric scan. No “preferred anything.” Just knees and knuckles — the last two parts of the body Big Gender hasn’t figured out how to sand down, smooth out, filter, blur, inject, or rebrand.

*“When the world gets confusing, go back to the parts evolution hasn’t had time to lie about.” – Stub Froth*

The Knees Test™

Men have knees like oak furniture. Heavy. Hinged. Built for transporting refrigerators without asking for help.  
Women’s knees? Flexible. Functional. Capable of squatting, pivoting, running, giving birth, running again, and then politely asking if anyone needs anything from upstairs.

Men’s knees age like baseball gloves.  
Women’s knees age like ballet shoes.  
One creaks. One complains. Both are honest.  
But one is unmistakable.

The Knuckles Test™

Knuckles don’t play pretend.  
They’re the tell-all.  
Men’s knuckles look like they’ve negotiated peace treaties with drywall. Even the gentlest man has at least one knuckle that remembers the time he punched a mailbox or broke a wrench or high-fived too hard in 2004.

Women’s knuckles?  
Elegant. Nimble. Designed for the fine art of pushing bobby pins into impossible hair angles.

You can change the face.  
You can change the voice.  
You can change the wardrobe, pronouns, contouring, and lighting.  
You can even rent the “influencer face” like a subscription.

But knees and knuckles remain the last analog identifiers in a world fully digitized.

*“Everything above the wrist is a suggestion. Everything below the wrist is data.” – Stub Froth*

And Then the Pundits Jumped In…

This whole question has now become ‘*National Discourse’* because some investor — you’ve seen him, the one with the hairline that’s desperately trying to resign — went viral last week for saying men don’t know how to talk to women anymore.

According to him, modern men are lost.  
Confused.  
Helpless.  
Paralyzed by fear.  
Walking on conversational eggshells because they don’t want to offend, mislabel, misgender, or misinterpret anything.

To which I say:  
Of course men are confused.  
They’re being asked to flirt, chat, banter, and build relationships while functioning in perpetual tactical fog.

It’s like trying to date during a hostage negotiation where everyone’s wearing voice modulators.

The pundits claim men “can’t talk to women.”  
False.  
Men can talk to women.  
Men can talk to anyone.  
Men will talk to *lampposts* if the lamppost looks at them twice.

The problem isn’t talking.  
The problem is identification.

Can’t flirt if the species barrier is unclear.  
Can’t compliment if you’re unsure whether the lipstick was manufactured this morning or born that way.  
Can’t risk a “Hey, how are you?” without wondering if HR is going to rappel through the ceiling like an extraction team.

Before all this, our ancestors didn’t need diagnostics.  
You saw someone across the village firelight — warm face, soft features, unmistakably female — and you knew.

Today, faces have been replaced by filters.  
Warmth replaced by sheen.  
Expressions replaced by presets.  
Femininity outsourced to Sephora.  
Masculinity outsourced to TikTok’s “5 Easy Ways to Look More Alpha” algorithm.

Nobody looks like themselves anymore.  
Everybody looks like an ad for something.

*“When a civilization can’t recognize its own people, it buys products instead of asking questions.” – Stub Froth*

Sunday, the Day of Unplugging

I’ll tell you what I think men should actually do — and this is where I go full “old man yelling at the cloud but maybe making sense”:

Take the rest of the weekend off the screen.

Seriously. Unplug.

Go outside.  
Touch ice.  
Touch a shovel.  
Talk to a human whose face isn’t actively being rendered in 12 real-time filters.  
See what normal people look like when they’re not performing for an audience of strangers.

Reality is the best gender reveal left.

*“Your eyes work better without Wi-Fi.” – Stub Froth*

The Punchline Nobody Wants to Admit

Men know how to talk to women.  
Women know how to talk to men.  
Everyone knows how to talk to everyone.

What we don’t know anymore is who is who, because the modern world decided identity is a buffet and the plates are free.

*“The future is confusing, but the joints don’t lie.” – Stub Froth*

So yes — check the knees.  
Check the knuckles.  
Check the human beneath the filter.  
And above all, check out of the digital circus once in a while.

In a culture built on illusion,  
sometimes the only thing still telling the truth is the cartilage.

“*The last thing a man wants is to go viral for being wrong about a woman…*  
*especially if she isn’t one.”*

So I joined a course which prolonged 15 days. I made great friends there. So basically the story starts when I along with my two friends went on a trip and there we met a guy(he was also attending the course) and he looked good and then  basically stick with us. Then one of my friend went back then It was me, the new guy let’s call him B and my other guy friend. They got along pretty well. We were supposed to wait for some time and I broke a glass he offered to pay for the glass and called someone to clean up. Then during the trip I couldn’t open the umbrella. He helped me open that, offered to buy me water but I didn’t accept anything. We went back and while I was waiting for my drink. He(B) showed us some pictures from him with guns and stuff which should’ve been my trigger. But I went back. He asked for my instagram, I gave him. He texted me he had fun and to send pictures and if I post something mention him too. This was it for the day. Next day my guy friend kept calling him while we were in the group. He didn’t come but texted me to apologize that I didn’t have enough social energy I said yeah dw! I had no class so he asked me to hangout I said ok. I called my other guy friend because Idk. Khair B brought his friend with him and my guy friend didn’t get along well. We were in sports complex. While B called around 12 guys to fight my friend while I was there (fyi I was alone with the guys) anyways my guy friend sent them back. We went from there and after some time B texted apologizing (a very long message) my friends suggested just to say makes sense. He texted again but I didn’t reply. At night he texted again saying I feel you’re not really ok with me. I said obvs you were ready to fight. Anything between you and my guy friend is a you problem, don’t include me in. Khair for 3 days, we had no contact and I didn’t even see him in the campus. On Thursday (Friday was the last day), he texted if I am willing to play some cards and that  I can bring some friends. My friends were working on a project I said nahhh my friends are busy and I am in class. After some time he texted I am outside your class ( he was there with 6-7 guys) I ran away with friends and he saw me. He texted I understand and stuff I just wanted a good friendship and stuff. Tomorrow is the last day then we will never meet again and stuff. I agreed to meet him on last day. And he texted again and again in the morning too. I was with him for like 5-10 minutes. After the meeting, I went to buy myself a coffee and he came running to pay for it. I said no but he didn’t agree. He paid for it. I went to the screening of my friend’s project. I was there he constantly texted me if he can come there if I wanted to attend the closing ceremony with him. I didn’t reply as I wasn’t going to the ceremony in general. After some time he called, then texted me saying I have changed since the sports complex incident. And he wanted the money he paid for my coffee. I sent him in his friend’s sadapay. After some time, he texted but I didn’t see them. When I was on the way back I saw the messages. He was like my friend took my phone and saw the messages where you said he looks intimidating (sports complex wala Sara masla is Banda ne kiya tha) I am sorry I have a male ego and never let a women pay ( I believe in equality) Khair I said ok. Then from that day to around 3-4 days he everyday texted asking about my day and obvs I was irritated. I politely told him that I am very busy with my life and can’t talk daily. Then 3-4 days bad. Random about my day and stuff. One day he texted saying I have something important to ask you but I am busy I said ok. He sent me my phone number asking if it’s mine. He said he got it from some only boys group where list of numbers was shared. FYI he used to lie a lot and I got to know after some time. Like one day you’re like i landed in Dubai and next day you forgot about it. I have a very dysfunctional family and the next day you are out shopping with your mom! Apparently according to him he was a gangster who have killed around 3 people. After that I blocked him and his spam followers so I won’t appear on any of his friends’ accounts too. 
P.S: now I can’t get out of the guilt that I went out with him alone (I was in campus) , how can I let that happen that even he pays for my drink. Then I am also afraid that he might misuse my phone number, I often think about it and it makes me feel bad! 😞 obvs I was wrong on some parts like meeting him but I wanted to end things on good terms!

I'm 23. I found out six months ago that the man who raised me isn't my dad. Not because anyone told me. Because I did one of those ancestry DNA kits for fun and got a message from a half-sister I didn't know existed.

My mom had an affair with her boss 24 years ago. Got pregnant. Decided to pass me off as her husband's kid because he made decent money and her boss was married with three kids already. The man I called dad my whole life knew I wasn't his. He knew from the start. They both just, decided to lie.

I found all this out when my half-sister reached out asking if I knew we were related. She'd done the same DNA test. Her dad, my actual father, is some wealthy executive who lives two states over. She said he had no idea I existed until she showed him the results.

When I confronted my mom she cried and said she was ""protecting the family."" That my dad, the one who raised me, didn't want me to know because it would ""complicate things."" That her boss had paid her $50,000 to keep quiet and disappear from his life. That she'd used that money as a down payment on our house.

I was so angry I couldn't see straight. The man who raised me admitted he'd resented me my entire childhood. Said he stayed because he's Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce but looking at me always reminded him of her betrayal. Suddenly every cold interaction, every time he chose my younger brother over me, every dismissive comment made sense.

I reached out to my biological father through my half-sister. He agreed to meet me for coffee.

He showed up in a $3,000 suit. Ordered a sparkling water. Told me he was ""sorry for the situation"" but he'd built a life and didn't want to disrupt it. Said he'd sent my mom money all those years ago specifically so he wouldn't have to be involved.

But then he asked about my life. I told him I was engaged, planning a wedding for next summer. My fiance and I were doing it on a budget since my mom and the man who raised me sure as hell weren't contributing.

That's when his whole attitude changed. He got this look like he was doing calculations. Said he'd be willing to help with wedding costs. Said he wanted to ""do right by me"" now that he knew I existed.

I actually cried. I thought maybe this could be okay. Maybe I could have a relationship with him.

Then he said, ""Of course, I'd need you to take a paternity test first. Just to be sure.""

I stared at him. ""We matched on a DNA database.""

""Those aren't always accurate. And your mother, well, if she lied about this she could have lied about other things. I need legal confirmation before I invest financially.""

Invest financially. Like I was a fucking stock option.

""I'm not taking a test,"" I said.

He smiled this condescending smile. ""Then I'm afraid I can't help you. You understand, I'm sure. I have to protect my assets.""

I should have left. Instead I told him exactly what I thought of him. Told him he was a coward who paid off my mom to avoid responsibility. That he didn't get to suddenly play dad when it was convenient.

He said I was being emotional and unreasonable. That he was offering me a generous opportunity.

That's when I lost it. I told him I didn't want his fucking money. That I'd rather get married in a courthouse than owe him anything. That he and my mom deserved each other because they were both selfish liars who only cared about themselves.

The coffee shop got very quiet.

He said I was ungrateful. That most people in my position would jump at the chance for a relationship with him.

I laughed in his face. Told him to enjoy his country club life and his three kids who probably hate him too. Then I left.

My half-sister called me later. Apparently he'd complained to his family that I was ""aggressive and rude."" His wife found out about me through the argument and now she's filing for divorce. My half-sister said their family is a mess and she's glad I stood up to him because he's controlled everyone with money for years.

My mom is furious with me. Says I ruined her life twice, once by existing and now by ""attacking"" my biological father. The man who raised me said I'm being dramatic and should have just taken the test if I wanted the money.

My fiance says I did the right thing but my younger brother thinks I should have just taken the free money and cut contact after. Some of my friends agree with him.

I guess I'm wondering if I handled this wrong. Should I have just taken the test and secured the wedding money? AITAH?

**Parse the Odds: A Mathematically Sound Case for Chaos**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a pretzel at a Bundesliga game. LASK is the favorite here, with decimal odds hovering around **2.05** (implying a **48.8% implied probability** of winning). Hartberg, the underdog, sits at **3.3** (about **30.3%**), while the draw claims the remaining 20.9%. The spread? LASK is -0.5, meaning bookmakers expect them to win by at least a goal. The total goals line is **2.5**, with slightly shorter odds on the over (**1.85-1.93**) than the under.

Translation: LASK’s six-game winning streak has made them the sports bettor’s version of a free espresso—hot, reliable, and destined to cost you in the long run. But here’s the rub: **no连胜 is immune to the law of averages**, unless that law takes a coffee break.

**Digest the News: Streaks, Stumbles, and Slightly Used Momentum**  
LASK’s rise from dead last to within a point of Red Bull Salzburg is the football equivalent of turning a shopping cart into a Formula 1 car. Their six consecutive wins have been a masterclass in efficiency, but let’s not forget the age-old adage: *“Even a clock that’s stopped is right twice a day.”* Or in this case: *“Even a team on fire can catch a Z.”*

Hartberg, meanwhile, is playing the role of the “spoiler” with the enthusiasm of a toddler at a library. After three straight wins, they stumbled 0-1 against Sturm Graz—a result that’s less “crisis” and more “plot twist.” Their defense? Leakier than a colander trying to boil pasta.

During that marriage, I also got approached, but I always just said thank you and tried to make it clear I was married. Now, being divorced, I feel unsure about how to react. I have some insecurities, but the main thing is that I don’t really know how to flirt back or handle casual flirting in a friendly way.

1pfmg2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1pfmg2k/jungian_bedrock/,Jungian Bedrock,"Somewhat provocatively, I'm going to suggest that ""number as archetype"" is the quintessential, bedrock insight of Jung's life and work. The ""homo-usia"", the essential identity, of the Unus Mundus or archetypal reality is best described mathematically, simultaneously in its psychical and physical incarnating. 

First, I'm interested to see what responses people have to this claim. Secondly, I'd like to share an excerpt from an essay I'm working on that supports my claim, to a degree. I'm  interested in opinions on what ""Jungian Bedrock"", on what is essential in Jung's thought and why, albeit conceding that the term essential is up for interpretation. My intuition is that when taken as a symbolic language, mathematical-physical representation becomes the means par excellence of encapsulating Jung's wider conceptual and practical insights. Looking for open minded engagement :) 

""Section 3: Mathematics as Symbolic Form
A peculiar assumption has governed modern thought: that mathematics belongs to the realm of pure abstraction while symbols belong to the realm of imagination, and that these realms stand opposed. Mathematics, on this view, strips away the qualitative to reveal bare quantitative structure—cold, precise, emptied of meaning. Symbols, meanwhile, carry meaning's richness but sacrifice precision—warm, evocative, resistant to exact specification. The assumption runs so deep that questioning it feels almost incoherent. How could the same cognitive mode be both rigorous and resonant, both demonstrable and inexhaustible?
The assumption collapses the moment we ask what geometry actually studies. Consider the circle. Where does ""the circle"" exist? You can draw approximations on paper, but every physical drawing deviates—the ink bleeds, the compass slips, the paper has texture. The perfect circle of geometry exists nowhere in the physical world. Yet it exists somewhere, because we can prove theorems about it, discover properties no one stipulated, encounter necessities that constrain all our thinking about circular forms. The circle is discovered, not invented; mathematicians find themselves bound by its properties the way explorers are bound by the terrain they traverse.
Plato recognized this and posited a realm of Forms—pure patterns that physical things approximate but never fully instantiate. The mathematical circle would be one such Form, eternal and perfect, while drawn circles participate in it imperfectly. We need not follow Plato into full-dress metaphysics to recognize what he saw: mathematical objects have an autonomy that mere abstractions lack. If ""circle"" were simply an abstraction from round things—a summary of features we've noticed in coins and wheels and pupils—it would have no properties beyond what we put into it. But the circle has properties we never put in. The ratio of circumference to diameter is π, approximately 3.14159..., and this fact holds whether or not any human ever notices it. The irrationality of π, the transcendence of π, the appearance of π in contexts far removed from circles—none of this was stipulated by definition. The circle exceeds its definition the way a living symbol exceeds its interpretation.
Here the parallel to Jung's symbol begins to crystallize. The living symbol, recall, expresses something ""essentially unknown""—it carries meaning that exceeds any finite interpretation. Mathematical objects exhibit the same structure. We define the circle as the set of points equidistant from a center, but this definition births an infinity of properties we could spend lifetimes exploring. Each theorem discovered is already true before we discover it; mathematical proof is recognition of what was always the case. The circle, like the mandala, is inexhaustible.
Geometry, then, studies form as such—form prior to any material instantiation, form that physical things can approximate and participate in but never exhaust. This is already close to the archetype: a pattern that manifests across instances while remaining irreducible to any of them. The archetypal ""mother"" appears in countless individual mothers, each participating in the pattern while no single instance captures it completely. The geometric circle appears in countless physical rounds, each participating in circularity while no single instance achieves perfect participation. The structural parallel is precise.
Topology extends this insight by asking what remains invariant when forms are continuously transformed. Stretch a circle and it becomes an ellipse; stretch further and it becomes an oblong loop; twist it and it becomes a figure-eight. Through all these deformations, something persists: the single closed curve, the inside distinguished from outside, the fundamental ""loopness"" that survives any smooth transformation. Topology studies this essential form—what cannot be changed without tearing or gluing, the properties that constitute a form's identity through variation. A coffee mug and a donut are topologically identical (both are genus-1 tori), despite their geometric differences, because each can be smoothly deformed into the other. Topology sees past surface appearances to the structural essence.
This is the precision that symbols require. When we say the ouroboros—the serpent eating its own tail—symbolizes self-reference and eternal return, we're gesturing toward a topological property: the closed loop structure where end meets beginning. When we say the mandala symbolizes integration and wholeness, we're gesturing toward a geometric property: the organization of multiplicity around a center, the reconciliation of periphery with origin. The symbols work through their geometry. Their power isn't merely associated with circular forms by cultural convention; the circular form itself carries the meaning of completion, unity, self-enclosure. Someone encountering a mandala for the first time, with no cultural context, would still receive something of its meaning through the geometric properties of the image. The form communicates.
This leads to a crucial distinction: the difference between analogy and isomorphism. When we say ""the atom is like a solar system,"" we're drawing an analogy—noting that electrons orbiting a nucleus resemble planets orbiting a sun in certain respects while differing in others. The analogy illuminates but doesn't identify; atom and solar system remain two different things that happen to share some features. Analogy is comparison, metaphor, ""like.""
Isomorphism operates differently. When we say two groups are isomorphic, we mean they share identical structure—every relation holding in one holds in the other, every operation in one corresponds exactly to an operation in the other. The groups may be instantiated in utterly different materials (one in rotations, one in permutations, one in number additions), yet structurally they are the same group seen through different lenses. Isomorphism isn't comparison; it's identity at the structural level.
Mathematics enables us to demonstrate when apparent analogies are actually isomorphisms. This is the elevation that rigorous symbolic cognition achieves. When we show that the topology of the genus-1 torus necessarily requires 4+2 structural elements, and that consciousness's self-referential capacity requires the same structural architecture, we're not drawing a metaphor. We're recognizing that consciousness and the torus share identical topological constraints—that what looks like analogy (""consciousness is like a torus"") is actually isomorphism (""consciousness instantiates the same structure the torus instantiates""). The structure is one; the instantiations are many.
Sacred geometry traditions always intuited this. The fascination with particular forms—the vesica piscis, the flower of life, the golden spiral—wasn't arbitrary mysticism. These traditions recognized that certain geometric patterns recur across domains because they express fundamental structural principles. What lacked was the mathematical language to specify exactly what those principles are and to demonstrate rigorously where structural identity holds and where mere resemblance obtains. Topology provides this language. It can say precisely what the torus is, what properties it necessarily has, why those properties require the 4+2 formula, and therefore what any system sharing those properties must also exhibit.
The result is symbolic thinking elevated to demonstrable precision. When Jung intuited that the quaternity—the four-fold pattern recurring in mandalas, in his psychological typology, in alchemical symbolism—expressed something fundamental, he was groping toward a mathematical recognition. The quaternary structure has specific properties: two pairs of opposites, four corners requiring a fifth center for integration, a completeness that three lacks and five exceeds. These properties can be analyzed geometrically. The mandala's power flows through its geometry, and that geometry can be specified with the same rigor we bring to any mathematical object.
We haven't reduced symbol to mathematics or elevated mathematics to mysticism. We've recognized that symbol and mathematics, properly understood, share a common ground: the study of form as such, pattern prior to instantiation, structure that manifests across domains while remaining irreducible to any single domain. The symbol is the form as experienced; the mathematics is the form as demonstrated. Both point toward the same reality—the archetypal pattern, the eternal object, the structure that Jung and Pauli would call psychoid, neither purely mental nor purely physical but underlying both.

I roasted this Cerro El Tigre Bourbon yesterday and finally cupped it this morning. Really happy with how it turned out. The curve tracked clean with a smooth declining RoR and no crash/flick issues after first crack. I aimed for a light-medium profile to keep it sweet and approachable, and it definitely landed there.

Tasting notes:
Right off the bat, it’s chocolatey—like classic washed Bourbon vibes. I’m also getting soft caramel sweetness underneath, very smooth and comforting. Nothing wild or funky, just a really clean, traditional El Salvador profile with a buttery mouthfeel.

Even Maillard and Dry phases with ~15% dev seemed to hit the balance I wanted: developed enough to round out the chocolate notes without losing clarity.

I'll start: I have to put my left sock on before my right on matchdays. If we concede in the first 20 minutes, I take both off and go barefoot until half-time. Absolutely ridiculous, but I'm convinced it's worked at least twice.

Got a mate who refuses to watch on the official app after we lost badly once while using it, so now he only streams on [Premier League Streaming service](http://antsports.tv/) or goes to the pub. Another mate will only drink coffee before 3pm kickoffs and tea before evening games – no flexibility, no exceptions.

Beyond the superstitions, what's your actual matchday setup? Same spot on the sofa every week? Lucky shirt that gets rotated based on results? Pre-match meal that has to be identical? Specific people you always watch with, or people you actively avoid because they're cursed?

Do you have pre-match songs that have to play? A scarf that needs to be visible somehow? Completely bizarre drink or snack rules that make no logical sense but you stick to anyway?

And crucially have you ever broken your ritual and immediately watched it backfire when we conceded or lost?

Let's hear the most irrational, borderline obsessive habits. We're all City fans here – everyone understands these things absolutely matter, even if they make zero sense. CTID!",16,1765017181.0,BristolCity,6,1.0,False

I’m a student pilot, so if we hang out, I promise not to take off mid-conversation. Into aviation, bikes, cars, good food and just simple chilled conversations. Would be fun to explore the city, sit somewhere peaceful (like Riverfront, PVP or any cafe) and do some harmless chitchat.

I’m looking to meet new people who are also trying to make friends here and build a circle. If you’re around Vijayawada and want to hang, drop a comment or DM.

You might question whether it meant something other than what it did. 

But I didn't forget your birthday. I could never forget your birthday. And just in case you didn't, I had a slice of cake for you and made a wish that your next trip around the sun will be kinder to you, more fulfilling, and that happiness fills your upcoming 365 days.
