That said, I would like to know. How can I add a coffee steam effect without using simulations? I tried using an image plane, but it clips through the model when I hide it from the camera angle. It looks weird when I try to deform the plane too.

I had planned to buy the Philips Lattego 5500 but then started looking at the Gaggia Cadorna Prestige bc my boss has one and I read they do better coffee drinks than the Philips which seems to be more concentrated on milk drinks (even though they have the same brew group). That took me down the rabbit hole of the Cadorna vs Accademia. For reference I am coming from a Breville Barista Express and I make all the drinks. I drink mostly americanos/long blacks and my wife is all about lattes. She has no interest in learning how to make espresso drinks herself and usually goes out for coffee when I’m not here so I need a superauto so she can make herself drinks when I’m out of town. I like the idea of the Accademia bc of the steam wand. We do eggnog lattes around the holidays so I figure the manual steam wand is the way to go rather than mixing eggnog and milk in a carafe. However, I’ve seen complaints about how small the drip tray is. Of course…I’d be happier not spending the extra money, but I will if it’s the best choice. So, my question to all of you with the Accademia or Cadorna - or even the Lattego 5500 (I was looking at this one bc of the ease of cleaning) - what do you think is the best option?

A Cultural Insider’s Intelligence for High-Value Travelers


Written by GJ 


1️⃣ SECTION 1. 

Operational Excellence: The Seoul Protocol


1.1 Navigating the Digital Ecosystem

In Seoul, Google Maps is often unreliable for walking directions. To move like a local, you need the ""K-Mobility Trinity""


• Naver Map / Kakao Map: Essential for precise walking paths and real-time bus arrivals.


• Kakao Taxi: The most reliable way to hail a licensed taxi (Uber works in Seoul by connecting to the local taxi system).


• T-Money: Your universal key. It’s not just for subways; use it in convenience stores and even some taxis.


1.2 The Cashless Revolution

Seoul is one of the most digitized cities on earth.


• Tap-to-Pay: Apple Pay is widely accepted at major franchises (Starbucks, GS25, etc.).


• Physical Card Backup: Small boutiques or traditional market stalls may still require a physical card or ""Cashbee."" Always carry one physical card just in case.


2️⃣ SECTION 2. 

Heritage Intelligence: The Royal Genealogy


2.1 Strategic Timing: Beating the Crowds

To experience the grandeur of Gyeongbokgung Palace without the sea of selfie sticks, timing is everything:


• The 09:00 Rule: Arrive at the gate 15 minutes before opening. You have exactly 20 minutes of ""serene palace"" vibes before the large tour groups arrive.


⛔️ Palace holiday 

- Every Tuesday : Gyeongbokgung, Jongmyo

- Every Monday : Changdeokgung, Deoksugung


• The Guard Change Logic: Most tourists crowd the main gate at 10:00 AM. Instead, head straight to the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion (the Royal Banquet Hall over the pond) during this time for a peaceful, unobstructed view.


▶️ Royal Guard Changing Ceremony Schedule 

- Gyeongbolging :10am. 11am. 1pm. 2pm.

- Deoksugung : 11am. 2pm.



2.2 The Architecture of Power

Don't just look at the colors; understand the hierarchy:


• Dancheong (The Colors): The five colors (Blue, White, Red, Black, Yellow) represent the five elements of the universe.


• The Stone Rank Markers: In the main courtyard, notice the small stones. These were the ""parking spots"" for officials based on their rank. The closer to the King, the higher the power.


• The Secret Backyard: Walk past the main halls to find Hyangwonjeong Pavilion. It’s a hexagonal masterpiece where kings sought solitude. It is the most ""Instagrammable"" yet historically significant spot in the palace.


3️⃣ SECTION 3. 

Gastronomy Analysis: The Real Taste


3.1 Market Dynamics: 

Beyond the Netflix Hype
Gwangjang Market gained global fame through Netflix, but its true culinary soul lies deeper than what’s shown on screen.


• The ""Queue"" Trap :
Famous Netflix spots often have long lines for decent, but not necessarily exceptional, food.


• Local's Secret: Your host will navigate you to multi-generational ""Nopo"" eateries – old-standing shops known only to locals, offering authentic flavors and a deeper connection to the market's history. These are often tucked away from the main thoroughfares.


• Seasonal Delights: Discover seasonal specialties that even many guidebooks miss, like Bindaetteok(pancake) made with specific seasonal greens, or unique regional Kalguksu(noodle) variations.


3.2 The Curated Flavor Map: Menu Decoding

• Mung Bean Pancakes (Bindaetteok): The Pitch ; The Korean Savory Hash Brown.
Made from stone-ground mung beans, it’s naturally gluten-free and packed with plant-based protein. It's crispy on the outside and soft inside.


• Hand-made Knife-cut Noodles (Kalguksu):

""The Ultimate Korean Comfort Pasta.""
Every noodle is hand-rolled and cut by a master. The broth is light yet deep—perfect for a clean energy boost during your walk.


• Beef Tartare with Pear (Yukhoe):
 ""The Premium Korean Tartare.
Visit only spots with the highest hygiene ratings. The sweetness of the Korean pear isn't just for flavor; its enzymes naturally tenderize the beef. High protein, low calorie.


• Mini Seaweed Rolls (Mayak Kimbap):
""The Addictive Finger Food.""
Don't let the name ""Drug Kimbap"" scare you—it simply refers to how addictive the mustard dipping sauce is! It's the perfect bite-sized snack for explorers.



3.3 The Art of the Korean Table: Understanding Banchan 

Korean dining is a communal and abundant experience.

• Banchan Culture: The array of complimentary side dishes (Banchan) is a cornerstone of Korean meals. It's not just food; it's an expression of hospitality and balance.


• Refills Welcome: Unlike many Western restaurants, Banchan refills are generally free and encouraged. Don't hesitate to ask for more of your favorites!


• Communal Harmony: Sharing main dishes is common. Embrace the communal spirit by trying a bit of everything and passing dishes around.


3.4 Dietary Logistics: 

Navigating Restrictions with Ease


Seoul's culinary scene is becoming more inclusive. Your guide is equipped to help you navigate:


• Vegetarian/Vegan: While traditional Korean cuisine often uses meat broths, a growing number of restaurants offer dedicated plant-based options. We'll identify these hidden gems.


• Allergy Management: Korean phrases for common allergies (e.g., ""Egg Allergy,"" ""Nut Allergy"") will be provided, and your guide will assist in communicating these clearly to restaurant staff.


• Spice Tolerance: Whether you love fiery gochujang or prefer milder flavors, we'll help you select dishes that match your palate, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable meal.


4️⃣ SECTION 4. 

Urban Transformation: Past meets Future


4.1 Bukchon Hanok Village: 
The Art of Coexistence

Bukchon Hanok Village is not a museum but a living, breathing neighborhood where residents still reside. Understanding this is key to a respectful and enriching visit.


• Residential Respect Protocol: Keep noise to a minimum, refrain from peeking into homes, and respect private property. The charm lies in witnessing daily life.


• The Best Views, Without the Crowds: Your guide will direct you to lesser-known alleyways and vantage points that offer equally stunning views of traditional hanoks against the modern Seoul skyline, often with fewer people.


• Cultural Immersion: Discover small, privately-run tea houses or craft workshops where you can experience traditional Korean culture firsthand, away from mass-produced souvenirs.


4.2 Aesthetic Curation: 
The Seoul Cafe Experience


Seoul's cafe culture is a global phenomenon, evolving beyond just coffee to become spaces of artistic expression and unique atmospheres.


• Hanok Cafes: Experience the blend of tradition and modernity in beautifully restored hanoks. These aren't just cafes; they're architectural statements offering a tranquil escape.


• Gallery & Concept Cafes: Explore spaces that double as art galleries, boutique shops, or themed experiences. Each offers a distinct aesthetic and photo opportunity.


• Beyond the Bean: Discover specialty drinks unique to Korea, from traditional teas (like Omija-cha) to innovative coffee concoctions that define Seoul's vibrant beverage scene.


4.3 DDP (Dongdaemun Design Plaza): Zaha Hadid's Legacy

The Dongdaemun Design Plaza  is a testament to Seoul's futuristic vision and architectural ambition, a stark contrast to the historical sites.


• Architectural Deconstruction: Explore Zaha Hadid's iconic neofuturistic design, understanding how its fluid, curved forms challenge traditional architectural norms.


• Design & Innovation Hub: DDP is more than just a building; it's a dynamic space hosting fashion shows, design exhibitions, and cultural events. Your guide can provide insights into current happenings.


• Nighttime Spectacle: Experience DDP transformed by light at night, offering unique photographic opportunities of its illuminated exterior.


4.4 Retail Intelligence: 
Smart Shopping in the K-Culture Hub


From K-Beauty to cutting-edge fashion, Seoul is a shopper's paradise. This section ensures you make smart, value-driven purchases.


• K-Beauty Decoded: Navigate the vast world of K-Beauty. Your guide will help you identify genuine, effective products and avoid common tourist traps or overpriced items. Focus on personalized recommendations. OliveYoung 


• Fashion Forward: Explore districts like Hongdae or Garosu-gil for unique local fashion brands and independent designers, offering styles beyond global chains. Hongdae&Seonsu


""Thank you for choosing to see Korea through a lens of strategy, respect, and authentic flavor. Your journey doesn't end here—it's just the beginning of your connection with the soul of Seoul. Seoul isn't just about landmarks; it's about the seamless transition between centuries, a city where every corner tells a story of evolution. A great tour is not about seeing everything; it's about seeing the right things at the right time with the right context. Seoul is a city that rewards the prepared.""



#️⃣ Professional Toolkit: The Insider’s Edge


A.Mobile Content Directing (The 15-Second Masterpiece)

Don't just take a photo; capture a memory.


• The ""Low Angle"" Rule: 
For Hanbok or Palace shots, hold your phone at waist height and tilt it slightly up. This creates a majestic, cinematic look.


• Food Steam Effect:
 Before snapping a photo of hot noodles, blow gently on the steam to create movement in your ""Live Photo"" or video.


• Portrait Mode Logic: Use 2x zoom in Portrait Mode for street food close-ups to blur the busy market background, making the food pop.


B.2 Essential Social Korean

Use these 3 phrases to instantly earn a smile from any local shop owner:


• Sa-jang-nim, cho-gi-yo!

(Boss, excuse me!) - The most respectful way to get attention.


• Jin-jja Ma-shi-seo-yo!""

 (It’s truly delicious!) - Better than a tip in Korea.


• Gam-sa-ham-ni-da!

(Thank you!) - Use this for a warmer, more local feel.


C.3 Emergency Protocol

• 112 (Police) / 119 (Medical/Fire):
English services are available.


• 1330 (Korea Travel Hotline):
A 24/7 multi-lingual concierge for any travel-related questions or complaints.

1qso2jr,https://i.redd.it/zi9h16i75tgg1.png,"Ronald Llamas: hold the ""Tsinadors"" accountable (Philstar)","“Tsinadors.”

This is what Filipinos online have branded the nine senators who refused to support a Senate resolution, signed by 15 of their colleagues, who crossed party lines to call on the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to take strong diplomatic action against the Chinese embassy in Manila. The resolution calls out the embassy’s troll-like public attacks on government officials, including senators, who have merely defended our position on the West Philippine Sea.

Leading this pack of Tsinadors is none other than the ever-wise Senator Robin Padilla.

Last Monday, Padilla took the side of a superpower bully that is crying over cartoon images of Chinese President Xi Jinping shown during a student forum where Commodore Jay Tarriela, West Philippine Sea spokesman of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), was speaking. He excused the Chinese embassy’s conduct, claiming it was “disrespectful” only because our public officials had supposedly disrespected them first.

Robin needs to learn a thing or two about sense of proportion.

A few cartoons cannot be equated with the real-life intimidation, harassment and acts of violence that Filipino fisherfolk and frontliners endure at the hands of the China Coast Guard in the West Philippine Sea – abuses that Robin has repeatedly failed to condemn.

Robin should maximize his office’s internet. A quick search would show him that China’s state media and propaganda outlets have long peddled political cartoons mocking our country, officials and citizens. So why are his friends in the Chinese embassy suddenly so onion-skinned? If they can dish it, they should be able to take it.

And yet, Robin berated the PCG for not acquiring modern and powerful water cannons to answer China’s water cannon attacks. Didn’t he just say that we shouldn’t be “disrespectful?” Do we need to remind him that just a few weeks ago, he was calling for “de-escalation” in the West Philippine Sea, a call that is perfectly fine except that he senselessly directed it at our own country instead of the foreign aggressor and intruder. And now, he’s urging escalation by telling the PCG to fire back with water cannons? Duh. Talk about turning one’s mouth into a crime scene for performative absurdity.

And then comes Senator Rodante Marcoleta. Not content with the widespread perception that he’s lawyering for the Discayas, he eagerly parroted the line of the Chinese embassy. He said that there are “no clear coordinates” defining the West Philippine Sea, as if China’s nine-dash line has fixed coordinates itself.

But this hardly surprises anyone. Marcoleta reportedly insisted before that the West Philippine Sea is a fabrication with no basis in maps, despite our historic 2016 UNCLOS Arbitral Ruling victory. Beijing must be beaming with pride. Now, all that’s left for the senator to do is to memorize China’s national anthem.

Not to be outdone, Senate Minority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano called for a hearing to “probe” first the exchanges between the Chinese embassy and government officials before the Senate passes its resolution. Sherlock Holmes, is that you? Where, exactly, are you living, under a rock? What more is there to probe? Are there mysteries that need to be uncovered? Almost all Filipinos already know this issue. It’s splashed across newspapers, radio, TV and social media.

But then again, what do we really expect from Cayetano, who, as former foreign affairs secretary, argued before the United Nations General Assembly that extrajudicial killings under ICC prisoner Rodrigo Duterte are not real, and who called Duterte’s cowardly and pro-Beijing foreign policy a “golden era” between the Philippines and China. What a joke.

Filipinos are justified in calling them “Tsinadors.” It’s actually brilliant. It goes beyond witty name-calling. It is a weapon of truth and accountability. Language, in this moment, becomes a tool of patriotism and resistance. To call the senators, who decided to side with China, “Tsinadors,” the people are not merely ridiculing them; they are holding them accountable in the court of public opinion. The act of naming and shaming them collectively transforms what might have been excused as isolated instances of political miscalculation into a shared judgment of betrayal that must be condemned by the entire nation.

“Tsinador” carries a weight similar to “Makapili” during the Japanese occupation, collaborators and traitors who wore “bayong” masks to hide their treachery. The “Tsinadors,” by contrast, are brazenly open, parading their alignment with a foreign aggressor without even a trace of shame.

The label asserts the primacy of our national sovereignty and communicates historical memory, civic outrage and moral censure all at once. It is a reminder to our leaders that there are real consequences for siding with foreign aggressors against Filipino interests. It carries instant moral judgment, accessible to every Filipino with a social media account or a conversation over coffee and beer.

It also reminds us of the deep political crisis we face. It is no coincidence that the Tsinadors are allied with Vice President Sara Duterte, who inherits and continues her father’s treacherous subservience to China. They are not merely defending a foreign aggressor. They are rehearsing a future where a second Duterte regime once again blurs our sovereignty, sovereign rights and territorial integrity, and reframes Chinese aggression as a “misunderstanding.”

We must not let that happen. Don’t let them rob us of our future.

So don’t forget the names of the nine senators who did not sign the Senate resolution: Alan Peter Cayetano, Pia Cayetano, Bato dela Rosa, Chiz Escudero, Bong Go, Rodante Marcoleta, Imee Marcos, Robin Padilla and Joel Villanueva.

Call them as they are. Let them burn in the fire of their treachery. Hold the Tsinadors accountable for choosing the comfort of foreign favor over their sworn duty to the people.",19,1769918800.0,Philippines,1,1.0,False

I love the Aeropress for certain lighter roasts to bring out the oils of the coffee to give lighter roasts more complexity, more body, than would otherwise get from a pour over. I definitely would not use a French press for specialty light roast coffee because the sediment comes out too heavy, muddying the experience.

used various methods to distress, from dremels to files and sandpapers, along with a good amount of clear and flexible fabric glue. i wanted it to look heavily distressed, but wasn’t keen on the thought of shaggy pieces barely hanging on all over the surface. when holding and feeling the jacket, although it may look like it’s falling apart, it’s actually very solid. it’s withstood 2 normal, hot temp wash and dry cycles without issue so i’m feeling good about it’s longevity potential.

1qsnklw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qsnklw/i_dont_know_if_i_should_stay_or_go/,I don’t know if I should stay or go,"Me and my boyfriend have known each other for 2 years. Only three months ago we started seeing each other outside of work, and soon after we started an official relationship (2 months and a half I guess!)

At first I was sure I’d found the man of my dreams. He was gentle, kind, a real gentleman, had true intentions with me, met my family and they all ADORED him! Getting to know him as a collegue had been amazing, I was so happy to see him!!

But things changed as soon as I got stressed/had a bad day. No idea how or why, but whenever I wasn’t my usual positive/smiley kind of myself he’d go quiet and become distant. I got some kittens from a bad person and spent lots and lots of money, time and energy to get them healthy, happy and thriving. We’re still battling but they’re warriors! I love the little villains and seeing them struggle made my heart break.

I tried communicating that being left on seen, him being cold and distant makes me feel worse, he promised to change that. He didn’t. Everytime I had a bad day it seemed like his day was 3x worse and he had so many problems (which I wasn’t aware of until I pointed it out that \*I’m\* not in the best mood).

Two days ago everything changed. I found out my dearest little kitten might have a real bad disease which could’ve cost hundreds of dollars. I was stressed, about her life and how to get the money. I also got some extra shit at work - I was left on seen again. I told him about the kitten and work - he told me not to worry and left me on seen. I wasn’t really jumping around, laughing and being happy. 

I do admit my texts were a bit dry, not because I had something against him. I just wanted him to feel “not ignored…?), I was in a bad mood and just needed a break. But I also wanted to give him attention and not make him feel alone..

But then all hell broke loose. We met at work, grabbed coffee like usual, he barely said ‘hi’.. he said he had some ‘doubts’ about our relationship;

\-he can’t imagine his live with me bringing in negative energy (you’re gonna be so negative everytime your cats are sick?!)

\-he was upset I wasn’t joyful and happy while talking, also because I didn’t text him back (that was after 9 minutes of not replying to previous texts because I was driving through the city)

\-upset because I was talking to the lady who’s actually (privately - bad experiences with the vets) treating/healing (??) my cats and not responding to him in a matter of minutes

\-upset because we have an inside joke in our family, it’s really stupid and it makes my mother laugh (not if she’s in a bad mood lol)

\-upset because I laugh about the things he has mistyped, which he had ALWAYS laughed at and made jokes as well, I had no idea it upset him

\-he said he checked if I’m online multiple times, then basically rubbed it in my face because I didn’t reply (he knows my data/wifi is ON 24/7)

\-he was upset I didn’t visit him and his family lately, knowing damn well I’ve been working/running my own errands while off work. I’ve been so busy I didn’t have time for myself or to even wash my hair (embarrassing I’m sorry).

All of this came SO out of the blue, I didn’t expect it at all so it really caught me off guard.

He said all that and more in such a rough/agressive tone that made me sure he’s gonna break up with me by the end of the night. But by the end of the night he said he felt sick, the boss told him he could leave early. Because I love the man I told him he could crash at my place which is closer, he waited for me at my place. 

In bed he cried a river, telling me he overreacted and that he loves me and that he was in the wrong. He apologised, so did I. I didn’t want to make him feel bad because of my problems but at the same time I felt bad because I felt so alone in all of this.

Today I went to work and texted him saying it’s okay with me if he stays tonight. But tomorrow I’d really like a day for myself to recollect my thoughts and chill out, to ‘reset’ my social battery. He left before I came back, texting me only when he was at home in his bed ready to sleep. And being distant and kinda ‘passive aggressive’ about it as well.

I don’t know what to do. I love him, but I’ve been neglected and abused in the past so it’s reaaaaally hard. When I’m in a good mood EVERYTHING is perfect, like a fairytale. But when I’m in a bad mood he’s instantly in a bad mood as well because of XYZ. Distant, quiet.. I’m so lost.",3,1769917369.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

|[Taegen Burns](https://i.imgur.com/b3UbDWy.jpeg)|*Avalon’s voice is low and rough edged for her age, usually carrying a lazy, unimpressed drawl that smooths out when she’s calm and sharpens when she’s irritated. Being from East Texas, there’s a subtle Southern accent that most locals wouldn’t look twice at but people not used to it catch it on certain words, especially when she’s tired or emotional with her vowels stretching longer coupled with a bit of  slack jaw*.|*5'3*|*Blue*|*Avalon’s hair is a deep brown, sometimes even apperaing black. It’s grown out since she cut it, now brushing her shoulders, and she’s settled on a layered bob after way too much trial and error. The layers give it a slightly messy, lived in look. Never perfectly styled, but intentional enough.*|

* [*aesthetic*](https://www.pinterest.com/PradaStraightJacket/dmg-ctrl/?invite_code=5d1e0fa3610f4739a4c1f172b5bd3cca&sender=597079000506031219​​​​​​)*; Black is her default. She's ed up some skirts instead of just jeans now but she mixes in muted colors like dark reds, greys, and faded purples so it doesn’t feel flat. She pairs skirts with ripped or opaque tights, worn in band tees or layered tops, and always stacks studded bracelets at her wrists. She wears a black eyepatch over her left eye, never decorative, just clean and functional, and it’s become part of her look whether she likes it or not. Black eyeliner frames her remaining eye, usually a little smudged, giving her gaze a sharper, more tired intensity*

***equipment***: *includes but is not limited to--*

* [smallsword](https://imgur.com/NxIJJHT)*; Short and well balanced, made for speed rather than brute force. The blade is clean and practical, with a simple crossguard and a worn grip molded to her hand from use. It was a gift from a son of Ares a year ago*
* *shield; Round celestial bronze, slightly concave, built to take impact and keep moving. The center bears a snarling wild boar’s head, tusks bared and picked out in darker bronze, with dark crimson paint splattered outward from the emblem, fading toward the rim like dried blood. Along the edge, ancient Greek lettering that read ""Those Who Act, Those Who Praise"" is etched deep and glows faintly when the shield is in use. After the incident at Key Tower, the shield is scarred and heat warped: patches of the crimson paint are blistered and blackened, the bronze mottled with soot stains and hairline scorch marks. One section of the rim is slightly rough where the heat bit in. Originally create by Jules Verma-Morgan*
* *bow and arrows; Compact recurve, dark stained and worn smooth from use. The grip is wrapped in leather, scuffed where her fingers always sit. Her arrows are celestial bronze tipped. Fletched in dark tones so they don’t catch the eye. A few shafts are nicked and mismatched from repairs*

***abilities***

    innate

*a) theft proficiency; a trait where some children of Hermes are attuned to the skills relevant to taking goods and services without the owner's permission*

*b)  hermes express discount; a trait where some children of hermes enjoy discounts when availing of hermes express services*

    domain powers

*a) adaptable skill; The ability to suddenly become competent in a particular skill. The effect lasts for 20 minutes (3 turns) before the target's skill level returns to normal. In 5-turn combat, this buff lasts only 2 turns. This elevates the user's skill level to a mortal competent in that field, but not to the level of an expert (just below Enhanced). This power does not also change the user's physical capabilities, such as their physical strength or raw stamina*

*b) alternate vision; a trait where one can perceive the world with a view normally impossible for a human mortal.*

    minor powers

*a)* *legendary communication; A trait where one is able to understand all languages (not the same as being able to speak or write in all languages)*

*b) superior strength; A trait where one displays one of the highest levels of speed, agility and dexterity known of half bloods. The character is able to reach speeds up to 35 mph (56.33 km/h).*

*c) lock manipulation (claudistikinesis), the ability to sense and control lock mechanisms. Although vision is not needed for this power to work, touch is*

    major power

*a) stealth; The ability to go unnoticed and unseen. (Variation of Invisibility, Effect ends after either 20 minutes or 3 turns.)*

***personality***

>*Avalon is still sharp tongued, sarcastic, and unapologetically blunt, but the edge to her snark has changed. What used to be playful defiance now carries weight. She’s quicker to bite, slower to laugh, and far less patient with nonsense, especially when it comes from authority figures who haven’t earned her trust.*

>*Her independence has hardened into something almost stubbornly self reliant. Loyalty still runs deep, but it’s quieter now, shown through action instead of words. She will fight for the people she cares about without hesitation but she’s learned the cost of that, and it’s made her guarded.*

>*Emotionally, Avalon is more closed off than she used to be. Anger comes easier than fear or grief, because anger feels manageable. She struggles with guilt and self blame she doesn’t know how to name, and she often masks it with irritation or dismissal. Vulnerability makes her uncomfortable; asking for help feels like failure. Still, those cracks show through in small, unguarded moments.*

* *mbti: istp*
* *temperament: choleric melancholic*
* *enneagram: 3w4*
* *allignment: chaotic good*
* *pokemon type: poison*
* *likes and dislikes*
   * *likes*; apple juice, late nights, powerpuff girls, charli xcx, kittie, eyeliner, cold weather, *purple​*

***backstory***

>*Avalon's story begins with her mother, Camellia Fletcher, a lead investigator for a private detective agency. Her meticulous attention to detail and sharp investigative skills made her the top sleuth in her field. Camellia's work often took her into the shadows of society, unraveling mysteries and finding answers where others faltered.*

>*During a particularly challenging case, Camellia encountered Hermes in the guise of a mysterious informant who always seemed to have a knack for providing the crucial piece of information at the right time. Drawn to Camellia's relentless pursuit of the truth, Hermes offered his assistance in navigating the intricacies of the cases she tackled.*

>*As time went on Camellia dealt with a heartbreak. The man she had secretly harbored feelings for, a charming colleague, ended up in a relationship with none other than her best friend. Hermes became a confidant, offering his unique perspective and occasional moments of levity amidst the serious nature of her work. Despite holding no real feelings for him, Camellia found temporary solace in his presence.*

>*Growing up, Avalon felt overshadowed by her mother's accomplishments. Unlike Camellia, Avalon struggled to excel in many things and often lead to dropping them enitrely. The absence of a supportive father figure and the complexities of Camellia's work left Avalon feeling isolated and yearning for a connection that extended beyond the confines of their lives.*

>*Camellia's attention, consumed by the intricacies of her cases, inadvertently added to Avalon's sense of inadequacy. The detective agency became a place of mystery and excitement for Camellia but a source of struggle for Avalon, who couldn't seem to find her place in the world her mother thrived in. As Avalon attempted to navigate her own identity, she grappled with the ever present feelings of not measuring up. Her relationships, particularly with her mother, became strained as Avalon yearned for recognition and validation in a household dominated by work.*

***now***

*Avalon eased the Hermes cabin door shut behind her, careful to keep it from creaking. The latch clicked softly, barely louder than her own breathing, and she paused for half a second with her hand still on the wood—listening. Nothing. Just the low murmur of voices deeper inside the cabin and the steady night sounds of camp. Good. Then she took off walking.

The cabin area was washed in low lanternlight, warm and uneven, shadows stretching long between buildings. Some cabins still glowed with activity—laughter spilling out, someone arguing over something stupid, music muffled through walls. Avalon kept to the edges of the paths, boots scuffing quietly over dirt and gravel, head down, hands shoved into her pockets.

She didn’t have a destination. That was the point.

Sitting around had gotten unbearable. Too quiet in the wrong way. Her brain wouldn’t shut up, kept looping on nothing important and everything at once. Sleep felt impossible. Every time she closed her eyes, she felt restless, itchy under her own skin.

So she walked.

Past the Apollo cabin, all golden light and lingering noise. She rolled her eyes and kept moving. Past the Athena cabin, dark and orderly, windows mostly unlit. The farther she went, the calmer it felt, not peaceful exactly, but less crowded. Less watched.

Avalon cut off the main path, wandering between cabins where the light thinned and the shadows deepened. The air was cool, brushing against her face, tugging at the ends of her hair. She breathed it in slowly, letting the movement burn off some of the static in her chest.

Her thoughts drifted without settling. Training tomorrow. Stuff she hadn’t said. Stuff she probably never would. Faces she kept pushing out of her mind because thinking about them hurt more than pretending they didn’t matter.

She kicked a small rock off the path, watching it skitter into the dark. ""...Boring"", she muttered to herself, though the word didn’t quite fit how she felt. Avalon slowed near the edge of the cabin area, stopping just long enough to look back. Cabins stretched behind her—familiar, messy, loud even when it was quiet. She didn’t hate it. Not really. She just didn’t know how to sit still right now. With a soft exhale, she turned forward again and kept walking, letting the night take her wherever it felt like going.*

1qsnfqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenLevelingUp/comments/1qsnfqs/how_to_be_disgustingly_successful_in_2025_the/,"How to Be ""Disgustingly Successful"" in 2025: The Science-Based Playbook That Actually Works","Okay, real talk. I've spent the last two years obsessively consuming everything about success: books, research papers, podcasts with billionaires and psychologists, YouTube rabbit holes at 3am. Why? Because I was so tired of spinning my wheels, working hard but getting nowhere. Turns out, most advice about success is recycled garbage that sounds good but doesn't work.

Here's what I learned from studying people who actually made it (not Instagram gurus selling courses). This isn't fluffy motivation. This is the actual playbook.

## Stop optimizing your day, start optimizing your year

Most people are obsessed with productivity hacks and morning routines. Cool, but you're rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Real success comes from choosing the RIGHT thing to work on, not working harder on the wrong thing.

Naval Ravikant talks about this constantly on his podcast. He says most people confuse being busy with being effective. The truly successful spend 80% of their time thinking about WHAT to do and 20% doing it. Everyone else does the opposite.

Try this: Every quarter, block out a full day with zero distractions. No phone, no laptop. Just you and a notebook. Ask yourself, ""If I could only accomplish ONE thing in the next 90 days that would make everything else easier or unnecessary, what would it be?"" Then ruthlessly cut everything that doesn't serve that one goal.

I started doing this after reading ""Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less"" by Greg McKeown. This book legit changed my brain. McKeown was a business consultant who worked with Silicon Valley execs and noticed the most successful people all shared one trait: they said no to almost everything. The book won't give you a 47 step system. Instead, it teaches you how to identify what actually matters. Best book on focus I've ever read. You'll finish it and immediately want to delete half your to-do list.

## Your network is doing more damage than you think

Here's something nobody wants to hear: You're probably surrounded by people who are accidentally keeping you mediocre. Not because they're bad people, but because humans unconsciously adopt the beliefs, habits, and income levels of their five closest friends.

This is called ""reference group theory"" in sociology. Dr. David McClelland from Harvard spent decades studying achievement and found that your ""reference group"" (the people you compare yourself to) determines your ceiling more than talent, education, or work ethic.

Practical fix: Find one person who's 5 to 10 years ahead of where you want to be. Not a celebrity, someone accessible. Offer to help them with something (for free). Most successful people are desperate for competent help. I did this by cold emailing someone whose work I admired, offered to do free research for their project. Six months later, that connection led to opportunities I couldn't have manufactured on my own.

Also, use the Ash app. It's basically an AI coach trained on therapeutic techniques and helps you work through limiting beliefs. I used it to identify patterns where I was self-sabotaging (turns out I had major imposter syndrome I didn't even realize). Stupid helpful for mindset stuff.

## Steal the 85% rule from top performers

Elite athletes have this concept called ""training at 85%."" Basically, you don't go 100% all the time because that leads to burnout and injury. You operate at 85%, which is hard enough to grow but sustainable long term.

Anders Ericsson's research on deliberate practice backs this up. He studied violinists, chess players, and athletes. The best performers practiced intensely but with built-in recovery. The mediocre ones either didn't push hard enough OR burned out from pushing too hard without rest.

Apply it: Work in 90-minute focused blocks, then take a real break. Not scrolling Twitter. An actual break. Walk, nap, stare at the wall. Your brain needs downtime to consolidate learning. I use Insight Timer for quick meditation breaks between work blocks. Sounds hippie, but the science is solid. Even 10 minutes of meditation increases focus and decision-making.

## The compound interest of 1% improvements is real but misunderstood

Everyone quotes James Clear's ""1% better every day"" thing. But here's what people miss: those 1% improvements need to compound in the same direction. Getting 1% better at ten different random things gets you nowhere. Getting 1% better at one skill every day for a year makes you world-class.

Cal Newport talks about this in ""So Good They Can't Ignore You."" (Newport's a computer science professor at Georgetown who studied how people build remarkable careers.) The book destroys the ""follow your passion"" myth and shows that passion comes AFTER you get really good at something valuable. Most brutally honest career book out there. Read it if you're feeling lost about what to focus on.

For anyone wanting a more structured way to connect all these ideas, there's BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google. Type in a specific goal like ""build a career I actually care about"" or ""develop world-class focus,"" and it pulls from books like Essentialism, research on deliberate practice, and expert insights to create a personalized learning plan. You can adjust each session from a quick 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples. The depth control is clutch when you're genuinely curious about something but don't have the energy to read a full book. Plus, you can customize the voice and tone, which makes a huge difference during commutes or workouts.

Action step: Pick ONE skill that has high leverage in your field. Spend 30 minutes daily on deliberate practice (not mindless repetition, focused improvement). Track it. In six months you'll be in the top 10% of people in that skill.

## The uncomfortable truth about timing and luck

Successful people love to pretend luck had nothing to do with it. That's bullshit. Luck plays a huge role. BUT, and this is important, you can engineer luck.

Research from Richard Wiseman (yeah that's his real name) studied lucky vs unlucky people. Turns out ""lucky"" people shared traits: they networked more, tried more things, and stayed open to unexpected opportunities. Unlucky people were rigid and missed opportunities right in front of them.

How to manufacture luck: Say yes to things that scare you. Weird coffee meetings, projects outside your comfort zone, moving to a new city. The more surface area you expose to randomness, the higher chance something good happens.

Look, becoming successful isn't about some secret formula. It's about consistently making slightly better decisions over a long period while most people quit or chase shiny objects. The system isn't rigged (okay maybe a little), but mostly you're competing against a bunch of people who will give up in six months.

The truth is, I guess the whole topic of Love is pretty new to me it seems very destabilizing and at times drives me absolutely psychotic. I've never felt the way that I do for you for anyone. 

  It's more than you're obvious handsome features and the fact that you're gifted in the bedroom.. it goes deeper no pun intended. I love your kind nature even though you try to hide it. I absolutely adore the stupid little things you do because you love me like the picture frame you got me for my birthday. I also love the things that annoy me and the things that absolutely irritate me to no end. Like how you make jokes about sad songs that you know I relate to and how you get certain coffee creamers just cuz you want me to try them even though you're not a coffee drinker unless it's iced coffee. I love that instead of being a complete dick head to me because you know your words can hurt you walk away and you give me time even though I feel that discussion is necessary but my words cut like knives too. I love the way you just sling your arm over me sometimes because I know you don't always feel like cuddling but you know that I need to feel safe in order to fall asleep. And I love when you wake me up with breakfast in bed and the way you look at me like I'm the most amazing thing you've ever seen. I've never felt so seen.. it's honestly alien to me again no pun intended.hehe. I love your morning breath and the way you get shy about kissing me until you brush your teeth. I even kind of like when you ignore me although it gets on my nerves cuz I've been ignored my whole life but I know you think it makes me want you more it actually makes me want to drop you like a hot cake but oh well. 

  I love most of all that when you catch me crying for whatever reason unbeknownst to you and tell you I need a hug and you'll sit there and hold me for as long as I need saying nothing because you have no idea what to say but it actually says a lot it says you love me it says that this past 14 going on 15 months has not been for not. I'm not wasting my time or my adoration even though sometimes it does feel that way and I know that you feel that way too sometimes. Thank you for never giving up on me even in the times where it felt like you gave up on me. And thank you most of all for giving me all the things that you know I've never had.

Like NOTHING.

Either drink in office or go outside.

Now normally that’s fine, but I’m from Punjab and chai for me isn’t just chai — it needs to have proper flavour, strong patti, and decent sugar. Proper maa wali chai vibes you know?

I tried 3–4 places nearby but honestly… all tasted bland. Either too watery or zero taste. Every sip just made me miss home more.

Then one day I randomly tried this tiny shop about 100 meters from my PG. Just a small stall run by an aunty from Jharkhand.

Bro… first sip and I swear it felt like therapy.

Perfect flavour. Proper sweetness. Strong. Garam.

Exactly the kind of chai I was craving for days.

Yeah the cup size is small af 😂

But now I go there daily.

She even started recognizing me like

“Beta usual chai?”

And idk why but that small thing makes the place feel a little less lonely.

Funny how sometimes comfort doesn’t come from big things… just a ₹10 cup of by chai and a kind aunty.

I don't want to be here anymore- Yeah, in both ways, yikes. But mainly ""I don't want to be here"" in a mental sense, like, don't want to be stuck here with this mentality. Anyways. I'm losing interest because nothing is interesting. I can spend hours learning things about fictional science/lore/anything because it's entertaining, but it won't get me anywhere in life. SCP Foundation? I have two notebooks full of information on it. Entities in an RPG? I have spent hours analyzing every single thing about them, and how I could easily get past them/interact with them correctly. Psychological horror games/horror games? I like to know every little thing about the characters, bad ones, good ones. All because I want to rant to myself about why I think they do things, and how they would be under different hypotheticals. I think I do this to make myself feel smarter. I love information, just not real life information. That's kinda why I like the paranormal, and like to acknowledge religion, because it's the closest damn thing I have to something really interesting. I'm a little disappointed in myself for giving up, and I keep telling myself that it's okay because ""I probably wouldn't have made it anyway"" and ""I can always find a hobby to make life interesting"". ""I don't have to be smart"". I can't be upset at myself for some things. I gave up on studying biology because it literally gives me panic attacks now, for whatever reason. Plus, I used to neglect my health just to study. I'm learning languages and putting chemistry on hold because its less stress on my brain. I don't know how much longer I can wait for medication, because I'm very convinced this is ADHD and anxiety causing it but I mean, I will be so behind even if I do end up pursuing science or something similar. Life is just so boring, that studying it seems pointless. Everyone already knows that, so it makes it seem less special. I get nothing out of it but hours wasted. But I miss when I did have motivation, sitting up at night on my 3rd cup of coffee, hand bruised from holding the pencil. I'm not burned out, I still have motivation, I just dont have interest. If that makes sense. I think I'm actually breaking my mind down, and I can't stop it. I mean, I feel like I've been close to a breaking point multiple times, and my past posts will show that. Im struggling because of me, and I know why but I don't know how to stop it. Which is embarrassing, because nowadays that's just called being in a bad place mentally. Off topic, but I legit have felt like 'Jim' from Jim's computer (unfortunately, the damn ROBLOX game) for years. That sounds cringe. But I wake up in the middle of the night, often to check my house because of paranoia, hallucinate, and have considered suic1de because I was so panicked from the paranoia. But when I told the social worker, she didn't care so I guess I'm completely fine mentally huh. Fuck, this is long. Sorry I think. Everything Is just getting so much worse, to where I'm actually sure I would gross someone out with even a small thing. At this point it's not a spiral, it's a loop. But it's getting shorter, meaning my time of happiness is getting shorter and the suffering is becoming more than half of it. Why is nobody helping me? Professionals, I mean. Is this not concerning?? Am I being dramatic? I just want to feel fucking normal for once in my life. This is getting out of hand, I need calm down. If you read this much, why?? I'm boring. But thanks for your time?

At 0600 sharp, the wireless speaker in Rachel’s hab blasted to life at volume 10, Freddie Mercury’s voice filling the small space like a stadium roar.

Buddy, you’re a boy, make a big noise

Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday

You got mud on your face, you big disgrace

Kicking your can all over the place, singin’

We will, we will rock you…

Rachel bolted upright, heart hammering, fumbling for the remote.

“Speaker OFF!” she yelled, voice cracking with sleep and fury.

The music cut dead. Silence rang.

Then came the pounding on the door—insistent, cheerful.

Rachel yanked it open, hair wild, eyes narrowed. “Liz, you crazy or what?”

Elizabeth stood there grinning like a kid who’d just pulled the perfect prank, still in her sleep shirt and shorts, datapad in hand like evidence of innocence.

“I love this old Earth music,” Liz said, barely containing laughter. “Still gets the blood moving, right?”

Rachel rubbed her temples. “I just got up. And my head is still from last night—late when you and Jeff finally left.”

Liz’s grin widened. “Can’t handle the liquor, uh?”

“Yes, but it was late,” Rachel shot back, half-laughing despite herself.

Liz stepped inside without waiting for an invite. “Well, it was smooth. Rach, get ready—I’ll pour you some gogo juice.” She headed straight for the kitchenette, already pulling out the coffee grinder.

0620 rolled around. Rachel emerged dressed—light pants, boots, quick-dry shirt—backpack slung over one shoulder.

“Okay,” Rachel said, taking the steaming mug Liz offered. “Let’s hit the pool first, then breakfast. Have Lili send us a ride. I’ve got my pack ready—just need sandwiches from somewhere.”

Liz nodded. “Not a problem. I’ll order from my store—have Checkers bag it up for four.”

Rachel shouldered the food responsibility. “I’ll carry the food. You handle coffee. Torres and Lili can bring protection and water. Sound good?”

“Sure,” Liz said. “Maybe bring my camera this time. I want pictures of those walnut trees.”

Rachel grabbed her arm. “Let’s go, you. Hurry up—we’ve got a busy day.”

She pushed Liz toward the door. Liz laughed, stumbling forward playfully.

“You sure are cranky first thing in the morning,” Liz teased. “You need to find a boyfriend before they all get snatched up.”

Rachel’s cheeks went pink. “Shush, you. I don’t have time right now. Got plenty to do with my job—” she pointed at Liz “—and keeping you out of trouble. I’ve seen how those forestry men look at you.”

Liz raised her hands in mock surrender. “Uh, yeah—not interested. I like men who wear armor. You know, like a knight from… what was that place your people are from? Salisbury? England? Wessex or something?”

Rachel groaned. “Keep walking and be quiet, or else.”

“Sounds like you need more coffee,” Liz shot back.

They stopped in the road long enough to fill their New Town collector mugs from the communal dispenser—strong black brew, still hot. Finally they reached the pool, only to find Marcus already there, leaning against the fence in swim trunks and a loose shirt.

 

Rachel called out, “Hey, big guy—what’s going on? Pool okay to use?”

Marcus straightened. “No, it’s fine. Just waiting for a friend.”

Liz’s eyes sparkled. “Would this be a lady friend?”

Marcus crossed his arms. “Sure. Just friends.”

Rachel and Liz exchanged identical knowing smiles.

Marcus pointed. “I seen that. And no—nothing between us.”

Both women chorused: “Yet.”

Everyone cracked up.

Marcus shifted gears. “You ladies going to the range today?”

“Yes,” Rachel said. “After we eat.”

Marcus nodded thoughtfully. “Maybe we need to talk about training for the council. Back home we went shooting all the time. I wasn’t bad at clay birds.”

Rachel tilted her head. “What’s a clay bird?”

“It’s a target thrown in the air,” Marcus explained.

Liz smiled, taking it in—still called clay pigeons on Haego, same as ever.

Rachel spotted a woman approaching—shorts, swim top, wide-brimmed hat. “Marcus, your uh… friend is here.”

Liz grabbed Rachel’s arm. “Let’s go get in the water.”

She pulled Rachel along. Rachel laughed, whispering as they moved. “Hey, that’s one of the vet techs.”

“Yes—keep moving,” Liz said, grinning.

They dropped their stuff on the sand and ran into the waves, screaming with delight as cold water hit.

Looking back inland, Marcus and the tech were walking the beach together, heads close in conversation.

Rachel nudged Liz. “That’s good to see.”

Liz nodded. “Rach, there are more women here than men.”

“Yes.”

“Not in the capital,” Liz added. “Plenty of young single men on Haego to choose from.”

A nice wave lifted them both off their feet, tumbling them in foam and laughter.

Time flew. They dried off, headed back to Liz’s place. Rachel ducked inside for her jacket—“Lili said to bring one”—then they dropped gear and went straight to Checkers for breakfast and to-go food.

Inside, Lili and Torres were already at the council table, coffee in hand.

Rachel raised an eyebrow. “You’re early.”

Lili smirked. “When you’re up at 0400, this is late.”

Liz called to the counter. “Breakfast, please—whatever the special is, times four!”

Order placed: eight ham-and-cheese sandwiches, bagged and ready.

Lili stood. “Let’s hit the range, then off hiking.”

Gear grabbed, they piled into the utility vehicle and drove to the range.

Torres ran firearm safety first—clear checks, muzzle discipline, range rules—voice calm and firm.

Lili watched, making notes.

They moved to rifles. Targets set at 50m and 100m—no drazzan this time, just paper.

Lili went first for demo.

50m: 10-ring perfect.

100m: 10-ring, one flyer.

She called Rachel up. “Load made safe.”

Rachel—new to this—felt clumsy at first. Optics on, 50m: 10 rounds, 3 fliers, still 10-ring.

100m: 10 rounds, 5 fliers.

Repeat: 4 fliers.

Sitting position, 20 rounds: 2 fliers, solid 10-ring.

Then Elizabeth.

Lili smiled. “The SM has spoken to your father.”

Elizabeth laughed, picking up the rifle, inserting a mag.

She swung past the 100m target—out to 300m. Flicked selector to full auto. Squeeze.

Ding ding ding.

Again. Ding ding ding.

Rachel was smiling—remembering her dad’s special forces days.

Rachel thought: One badass sister.

Lili in quiet awe. Torres blank-faced but impressed.

Elizabeth saying someone  grab  the rifle. “Let’s go, ladies. Daylight’s wasting.”

She figures that Dorian would not want her to act like this, but there is no way to tell what Dorian would want anymore.

Still, the next day is another renewal. No one has signed up for the Satuday meal, so Harper decides to make use of her idle hands and a half-faded memory to make some of her cousin's favorite dishes.

A dinner takes form. The nymphs and satyrs are instrumental to the process, and Harper owes them her thanks.

Mentally, I feel confident I made the right decision, but emotionally I’ve been all over the place as I’ve incrementally made contact with my wife and her family, at which point my confidence falls to pieces, but then slowly builds up with distance again. I left because I seriously suspected infidelity and she refused to provide any kind of clarity so I walked. Here’s the story and my reasons for suspecting:

\-my wife met a guy when she was about 20. He was about 10 years older than her and was her first boss in her career and has been kind of a mentor figure to her. For the majority of our relationship, I never had an issue with their dynamic (we started dating when I was 17 and she was 18)

\-about 3 years ago, my wife started going for drinks somewhat regularly (maybe once every two weeks) with this guy and another close female friend from work. Again, didn’t have a problem with this.

\-during this time, my wife expressed to me that she was concerned that this guy and the other female friend might engage in an affair (they’re both married). I didn’t suspect my wife at all at this point, but this was a red flag about the guy, since it indicated that she believed he was at least capable of cheating.

\-eventually, the female friend stopped joining them and my wife was meeting with this guy one on one for coffee, drinks or lunch.

\-I still wasn’t concerned at this point, but felt it was necessary as her husband to draw a healthy boundary: she said they had talked about meeting once per week and I said that was too much and ideally, they should try and see each other with other people present or at the very least, not meet together nearly that often if it has to be one on one.

\-my wife did not respond well to this. This was the first major red flag. She expressed that she felt like I was trying to cut a very important person out of her life. We argued about this for a few weeks and didn’t reach an agreement and she even saw him a couple times during this tense period.

\-one night the argument eventually came to a head and I insisted that she stop having these meetings altogether. She accepted begrudgingly.

\-when she returned home from work the next day, she was visibly upset and told me that she told him they wouldn’t be able to meet frequently anymore. She then asked me “how often am I allowed to see him?”

\-about 2 weeks later, my wife said she wanted a divorce. From my perspective, this was completely out of the blue. She cited small grievances (nothing even remotely close to infidelity or abuse on my part, more like a bunch of little frustrations). She insisted that the other guy had nothing to do with it.

\-after long talks with me and her family, she agreed to stick around but never admitted to the other guy being involved in any way.

\-about 6 months of us trying to fix the marriage, which was going well, she went to a work party where this guy was going to be. She hadn’t seen him in a long time.

\-the very next day, she brought up divorce again, very much out of the blue. She continued to deny that this guy was a factor in any way.

\-again, I managed to get her to stay. We kept going the last 6 months, but it always felt to me like her heart wasn’t in it.

\-during this time, she’s frequently been going out for drinks with friends from work. I don’t know these people. They stay out quite late. (I know this sounds odd but I was trying to save the marriage and I felt that any pushback would result in her just leaving.)

\-I’ve been periodically pushing for more clarity on the situation with this guy. She’s given me nothing and continues to insist that it’s absolutely not a factor.

\-I even suggested that the four of us (me, my wife, the guy and his wife) get together for dinner. It wouldn’t be for me to grill him, but an opportunity for me to demonstrate to him that I’m present and I’m aware of him, and for my wife to show me that the dynamic between the two of them isn’t problematic. She refused.

\-in the summer, after I’d made it abundantly clear that I was uncomfortable with her relationship with this guy, she attended a golf tournament for work where she was in a foursome with this guy. The day before, her and another girl in the foursome went shopping for a golf outfit. It was essentially a mini skirt and a neon tank top.

\-last week, I told her I need some clarity on the situation or I would walk out the door. She didn’t give me any and I’m gone.

There are plenty of other red flags from this time but I can’t list them all. Her parents have reached out to me since I left and don’t want to hear my story and instead ripped into me for being a bad husband. Much of what they said wasn’t true and was based on lies that my wife told them. I didn’t feel I could respond and correct them because it would turn into my word against hers and they would believe her every time. All they know is that I suspected cheating because a year ago my wife met one on one with this guy a couple times. I asked her to stop and she stopped. That’s all they know and they won’t hear me out. Her dad told me he looked her in the eyes and asked her if she had an affair and she said no. He said he knows when she’s lying and he believes her.

Prior to this I had a great relationship with her parents and really respected them. The conversations with them have left me very disoriented and questioning my decision. I’m not crazy right??",35,1769915424.0,relationship_advice,44,0.87,False

The ability can be used on the user as well with them causing themselves to immediately become tranquil or push themselves into a hyper intense rage. It's awakening would allow the user to physically manipulate emotions. By touching another person, the user can draw out their emotions in the form of a colored energy blob, leaving them completely emotionless temporarily, and infuse something with it. This would be a very helpful ability as the strongest emotions we have aren't just one emotion but a complex cocktail of emotions in a very particular mix. I could make you very sad, but It would be very hard to replicate the precise emotional trauma you feel after watching someone murder your child. So instead the user could inflict said trauma on somebody, extract that precise mix and intensity of emotions, infuse a cup of coffee with it, and serve it to someone they hate.

The journal contains the account of her son, Erik Olson, who volunteered to fight with the XV International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. Throughout her entire life, she had never spoken of the journal’s contents, and it is only now, with her passing, that we can examine what her son experienced in Spain. The following letter is included with the journal, being taped to the inside cover of the journal.* 



December 15th, 1936: Dear Ma-Ma. I’m sorry that you must find out about this through a letter, but I knew that if I had tried to tell you in person, I would not be able to bring myself to leave. The call has gone out for volunteers to fight against the fascist menace in Spain. The Communist International has cried out for me, and I have to answer the call. 

You always tell me of Pa, and how the war scarred him and caused him to leave us. But this isn’t the same imperialist war that Pa fell into. This is a righteous fight, and I must go to where my heart is calling me towards, and the Spanish proletariat has screamed to the world for help, and while the capitalist powers turn their back on her, it’s up to me and others like me to answer the call. 

Know that I do this with a heavy heart, and hope that you can forgive your son for going off to war. 

Love always, Erik. 



*It’s believed that Erik managed to bribe entry onto a steamer headed for Spain and arrived in January 1937. From here onward, the story that he recorded in his journal. Take note, that the majority of the Spanish included in the journal have been translated for easier reading.*  
  


January 15th, 1937: Finally arrived in Valencia! The city is abuzz with activity, and armed workers patrol the streets. I managed to buy this journal off a miner who eagerly came up to me, wondering if I was a part of the International Brigades. We began to chat, and I must be thankful that I took those years of Spanish in university. It seems like fate that it came in handy. The miner explained to me that the Fascists were currently attacking Madrid and that, through the bravery of the workers of Madrid and the foreign volunteers, that the Fascists were being held at bay. 



This is wonderful news! And shows that the proletariat can defend itself against the arms and tactics of the Fascists. The miner sold me his journal for only a few céntimos and a promise that when the war was won, we’d get together and have a few drinks. With my journal secured I headed to the headquarters of the Communist Party of Spain. I was hoping that they would be able to tell me where I was to go, now that I had set foot in Spain.



The Headquarters was a mess of people running around with papers and explaining back and forth about what was happening. It took me a few minutes to finally get the attention of a party comrade and inquire about where I was meant to go. The scruffy looking man with thick glasses and a big beard quickly dropped the papers he was holding and grabbed me by the arms. He thanked me for coming and quickly took me to the back offices. He explained his name was Jorge, and was elated that I had come to Spain. He explained that another International Brigade was being set up, which included mostly Americans and English. He explained to me that they were being mustered in Albacete and that he would eagerly arrange transport for me. 



I’m writing now from a hotel room that the party comrades have set up for me until the transport can be arranged. I must admit, the nerves are starting to set in, and I’m beginning to wonder if this was the right choice of action to make. But then I think back to all those comrades outside in the street. They scream and shout the same phrase, ¡No Pasarán! They shall not pass. If Fascism is to be stopped here in Spain, I must join them. 



January 17th, 1937: Finally arrived here in Albacete. The journey was some of the worst driving I’ve ever seen from anyone. Partly from the old Ford pickup that I was driven in, but also the absolute abominable state of the roads in Spain. We were lucky if we were able to drive on a smooth section of road for more than an hour or so. My driver, a salty peasant named Benito, didn’t talk to me much at all during the journey. He seemed only to be doing this because the party comrades had paid him to do so. 



Despite the terrible state of the roads, Spain is a truly beautiful country. The mountains are rugged, and even in January, the days are still warm, and even the cold nights, there’s just something so special, if even magical, about this beautiful country. The fields are full of peasants who have taken the land over from their landlords, at long last fulfilling their dreams of owning a piece of land just for themselves. What little Benito did say was that he was happy to finally have land to work for himself instead of his boss. 



When at long last we arrived at Albacete, I was overjoyed to see other Americans there. I was worried that perhaps I was the only comrade who had arrived from the New World. But I was elated to see others. I even have made the acquaintance of the British volunteers, who, despite their posh accents, have the same goals towards saving Spain from Fascism. I am slightly disturbed, however, that I’m one of the only ones who can understand Spanish at all. Some of the Brits can speak French well enough, but there’s a big leap between the two languages, and I worry about communication during battle. 



But for now, I’ve settled into the barracks of Albacete and now await the time when the Brigade is fully constituted and can go to the fight against the Fascists. The news from the front is a chorus of contradictions. Some say the Fascist columns of Franco and Mola have been thrown back in full retreat from Madrid, while others say that the city is mere days from falling. Whichever is true, if either of them is, I hope that we can arrive in time to turn the tide. 



January 18th, 1937: I’ve gotten to know a few of the fellow International brigaders, and I’m amazed at the different types of people I’ve been exposed to. A few like me are college-educated kids who also heeded the call of Moscow to fight against Fascism here in Spain. Some are refugees from countries where their parties have been banned and prosecuted, a few Yugoslavs, Greeks, and Bulgars. 



To me, the most interesting character in the American camp is Big Joe. A great big Appalachian man, who not only is a veteran from The Great War but is also a veteran from the coal wars and the battle of Balir Mountain. He’s one of the very few professional soldiers that exist amongst us, and that’s made him quite popular with the rest of us. Despite being barely able to read or write his own name, he has a deep sense of wisdom and knowledge that the rest of us educated fools don’t seem to have. 



I feel slightly out of place, being the youngest out of most of my fellow brigaders, but I’m sure that in time, a bond will develop between us all. Afterall, we’re all here for one thing, and that’s to spread the revolution and defend it. 



January 20th, 1937: The past few days have been spent waiting for weapons to arrive to arm us, and in the meantime, we have become set up here in Albacete and have finally been fully organized into the XV International Brigade. The Americans have been formed into a battalion, and we quickly agreed to name it the Lincoln Battalion. Who better than the great emancipator to name our group fighting for freedom? While it isn’t official yet, the battalions and companies have more or less coalesced into what we will be organized into. 



The Irish have been making a big fuss over possibly being organized with the Brits. There’s still bad blood from the Irish war, and they refuse to be attached to the British Battalion. Apparently, they’d rather be attached to our battalion, which would make sense. A few of the other comrades in the Lincoln are of Irish descent, so it would make sense to have them serve with us. Other Irish would rather stay with the French contingent. All in all, there’s maybe about 1,000 to 1,500 of us so far, with more trickling in. 



There are still no signs of the weapons we are to be assigned, which worries me. There’s already rumbling through camp that we might be going into action soon. I struggle to see how we can fight Fascism without rifles or bullets. For now, our training consists of learning to march in step with each other and practicing with sticks on how to properly hold the rifles that are hopefully on the way soon. The rest of the time is spent reminding us of Communist Party doctrine and extolling the virtues of Comrade Stalin. We’ve even been given copies of both the manifesto and *Das Kapital*. 



I’d be lying to myself if I didn’t mention that I miss home. And wonder how Ma-Ma is handling things, knowing that I left her back home without saying goodbye in person. I think to myself that perhaps it would’ve been better to tell her in person, but I know that she would’ve talked me out of coming here to Spain. 

A part of me wishes that she had told me to stay home. 



January 25th, 1937: The promised weapons have arrived at long last, and I’ve never seen a sorrier excuse for weapons in all my days. They range from old Spanish Mausers, which is what I received, to French Berthiers, Austrian Mannlichers, and a few Russian Mosins. How are we supposed to keep track of all these different ammunition? Some share similar calibers like the different versions of Spanish Mausers, but the others all require specific rounds. In the heat of battle, how can one hope to keep the rounds correct to his gun? 



I count myself lucky that I was given a Spanish Mauser. Even if it’s most likely older than I am, and the wood is worn and cracked in a few places, it seems like a fine weapon all things considered, and the ammunition will hopefully be plentiful. I am, however, worried about the pistol I was also given. It's a Ruby pistol, and I can’t help but hear the French snicker every time I practice with it. Seems that a few of the French comrades have experience with the Ruby, and they suggest I use it as a club instead of relying on it as a pistol. So far, I haven’t encountered any problems with it, but that feeling nags at me in the back of my head every time I look down at it. 



Training is now proceeding well enough, but it’s not at all what I expected. I was given a couple of boxes of Mauser rounds and told to practice with my rifle. I wasn’t shown how to clean, use the sights, or anything. We’re lucky enough to have a few Great War veterans to try and show us the ropes, but it’s almost laughable how bad shots most of us are, myself included. Hopefully, with more practice, I can be somewhat helpful to my comrades. 



January 27th, 1937: Training continues, with mixed results across the board. I’m getting the hang of the Mauser, but sighting it has become a hassle. The old rusted metal can become knocked out of place and has to constantly be put back into place. Our Machine gun detachment has been having better luck, but they have so few bullets to spare that they can only expend a few rounds each time. 



The questions about our uniforms were finally answered today. The commissars passed around clothes that bear the colors of the republican flag: red, yellow, and dark purple. I thought at first that they had simply made little flags for us to wrap around our arms, but they are meant to wrap around our arms to show that we are Republican fighters. Other than that, we haven’t received any sort of standard uniform, and we also haven’t been given any hermelts either, which greatly upsets Big Joe. He’s been warning about the dangers of shrapnel to anyone who will listen to him. 



The food is also starting to get on my nerves. A few times, we haven’t even been given food. And the few times we do get it, it’s always the same. Rice and beans, mixed all together with a cup of bad coffee. Several of the Lincolns desperately miss any sort of meat. We’ve left the barracks and tried to procure meat from the city itself, but even there, meat is scarce. There’s been talk about going out into the country to ‘requisition’ some animals for meat, but we’d be no better than the Fascist bandits if we did so. 



It’s better just to eat the food that comes to us. If we devolve into thieves and brigands, what makes us better than Franco’s forces? I believe we must be better than they are, and we must set an example for all others who might follow us. 



I’ve also decided on a *nom de guerre*. Several of the Lincolns have one, and I felt that I should have one as well. While I haven’t read the bible since I was a child, one name has always stood out to me. And so, for the duration of the war and until I arrive home, call me Absalom. 



January 30th, 1937: There’s been quite a bit of buzz around camp that we might be shipped out to Madrid. I am, however, concerned by this. Not only for the fear of battle finally approaching, but also that I feel that not only I, but the entire brigade is woefully unprepared to go into battle. Most of us are still no better with our rifles than when they first arrived, and there’s a severe lack of progress made with any actual training. 



Big Joe has been trying to pick up the slack that the commisars have shown towards training. He’s been showing us how to fight in a squad and has been acting almost as a drill sergeant of sorts. He’s also far and wide the best shot in the whole brigade, even winning a makeshift contest we made to see who could hit the most targets the fastest. He’s shown me how to at least try to clean my rifle and ensure that it continues to work. As payment, I offered to teach him how to read, though he simply smiled and told me that many had already tried and failed to do so. 



As night approached today, I heard singing and laughing coming from the Irish detachment camp. The Irish assigned to the Lincoln Battalion have taken the name of a leader during the Easter Rising, calling themselves the Connolly Column. I was on sentry duty and was struggling to stay awake when I heard singing from a small fire near their camp. Leaving my post to investigate, I came upon about 10 or so members of the column sitting around the fire and laughing and singing.



They invited me to join them, and after assuring me that no one would care that I left my post, I decided to sit down with them and listen as they sang traditional Irish songs. One of their members, Bill Henry, was playing a small guitar while another member, Bill Beattie, gave the lyrics to the song. A few of the Irish offered me swigs of whiskey, but I politely refused, happy to just sit by the warm fire and enjoy their company. Soon, they started singing a song that was somewhat familiar to me. 



It had the same tune that ‘When Johnny Comes Marching Home’ has, but has different lyrics. And while the Connolly boys were giggling and singing along, I couldn’t help but pay attention to the lyrics of the song. A song about a woman who finds her old lover back from war, horribly mutilated. And yet despite that, she still loves him. 



*I’m happy for to see ya home, hurroo, hurroo*

*I’m happy for to see ya home, hurroo, hurroo*

*Oh, I’m happy for to see ya home*

*From the island of Ceylon*

*Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ya*



I can’t help but hope that Ma-Ma will think the same thing of me when I come home from all this. Even if I lose an arm or a leg. Though hopefully I don’t end up an armless, boneless, chickenless egg. 



February 2nd, 1937: We’ve arrived at Madrid! The city is in desperate need of reinforcements, and so we’ve arrived to shore up the barricades against the Fascist waves. We arrived to a heroes' welcome from the people of Madrid. They tossed flowers at us, and the girls came up to kiss us and thank us for coming to save them. The city has been damaged from the previous battles, and yet the spirit of the people of Madrid remains unbroken. 



They sing and dance and wave the red flags; it all seems like a fairy tale to me. I can only imagine that this is what life in the great Soviet Union must be like. Large pictures of both Stalin and Lenin are hanging from buildings, along with the Spanish Prime Minister Largo Caballero. It seems impossible that the Fascists can break this ring of iron, and I’m more than happy to aid in its defense. Hopefully, there will also be better food options here than in Albacete. 



February 6th, 1937: Battle! The Fascists have struck south of Madrid near the Jarama River! It seems like they want to cut the road from Valencia to Madrid, and if they succeed, Madrid will have its only supply line cut. Already, the XI and XIV International Brigades are there and have taken the brunt of the attack. 



We are expected to join them in a few days. The excitement is palpable, and it seems that any fear I may have has been taken away from me with this news that we will now have a battle at last. But I also worry about our level of training. Many of us still aren’t fully trained, and our rifles are still a mix of calibers. 



Tonight I heard shots ringing out in the city. I wondered if perhaps the Fascists had already penetrated this far into the city, but as I poked my head outside my window, I saw that it was executions. Priests were being led out from their church, just across the street from where we were stationed, and being executed by Spanish soldiers. 



Marx described the church and religion as the opium of the masses. And the Catholic church is nothing if not an archaic relic that belongs in the past. It is the church and the landlords that held a stranglehold on the peasants and workers of Spain. Still, seeing these priests silently kneeling and praying as a pistol is placed to their heads is a haunting sight. This is my first view of war, and while the church must be swept aside for Spain to be free truly, I can’t get the image out of my head. 



February 7th, 1937: Wounded have begun to arrive in Madrid from the battle. Many of them are our brothers in the other International Brigades. There’s talk that Franco has managed to reach the banks of the Jarama. There’s talk of us going into battle tomorrow, or even later in the day, but for now, our orders are to stay in camp and await the orders. More priests were shot today. This time, they also dragged a nun outside. I didn’t see what they did to her, but her screams were enough to give me an idea. 



Food has been getting harder to stomach. We’re now down to a plate of bread and chickpeas. I never thought I’d miss the beans and rice that I had grown so tired of. With battle so close now, I find it difficult to document my feelings; no word holds the right impact. I’m afraid. And for the first time, I’ve begun to truly question if I made the right choice. 



It’s started to rain here. 



February 8th, 1937: The battle has come to a halt, and the rain has swollen the banks of the Jarama. I’m almost thankful, and hope that the battle will not continue. But I know that I signed to fight. 



More priests were executed, along with more nuns. I watched as the commissars oversaw the executions, and I could see that they were enjoying what they were doing. Is this what I signed up for? 



“You can’t make a revolution in white gloves.” Comrade Lenin once said. And while I know this to be true, I can’t help but wonder if this is necessary. I asked a few of the other Lincolns what their thoughts about it were, but they were just as conflicted as I am. A few of them declared that this was a necessary step for the revolution. Others were disgusted and hoped that it would stop. 



I miss, Ma-Ma. 



*The Following entry is noted for having worse handwriting than usual. Perhaps because Absalom was writing this while on a truck bound for Jarama.* 



February 11th, 1937: The Fascists are across the river! They’ve somehow managed to get across the river and are now fighting their way towards the Valencia road. At last, we’re being mobilized to throw them back across the river. 



The fear and nerves continue to plague me, but the excitement is infectious as we begin to drive towards Jarama. Big Joe has been checking on all of us constantly, ensuring that we keep our weapons dry and our fingers away from the trigger. In the terrible Spanish roads, it’s a wonder how none of our rifles have gone off accidentally from all the thrashing. 



All day we’ve seen Soviet made planes flying overhead, and I can’t help but smile at seeing the comrades controlling the skies above. The Spaniards call the Soviet monoplanes""Moscas,"" meaning ""flies."" And the comparison isn’t far off. They seem so small and agile, I can’t help but imagine a giant flying insect when a few of them fly overhead. 



Already now, the rumbling of artillery and the cracks of rifle fire are getting closer and closer as we arrive near Jarama. I can’t help but be thankful that I didn’t get a bite to eat before we left Madrid. My stomach is hurting so badly that I’m almost certain that I would’ve thrown up by now. A few of the others in the back of the truck have already done so. 



The truck has come to a stop at last, and we’ve all been ordered to disembark. A few wounded have streamed past us. And a few dead as well. A few members of the XI brigade came to meet us as we disembarked, and they told us how badly the fighting at the front was. 



We aren’t going to the front yet, as the rest of the XV still needs to arrive with us, but all I can say now is that I’m scared. And the rumbling of artillery and the cracking of machine gun fire is louder than ever. 



*From here till the end of the journal, the handwriting is noticeably worse.* 



February 14th?, 1937: Where do I begin? Perhaps at the attack. More like a slaughter. The Commisars told us that our attack would be against the hill called the Pingarrón that had changed hands countless times already. A squad of British machine gunners had held it until they were driven off it by bayonet point. Now it was our turn to charge against it and retake it. They said that tanks, artillery, and even airplanes would come to aid us in the attack. Lying bastards. 



We formed up in a group of olive trees, keeping low to avoid sniper fire. When the loud, shrill whistle broke the silence, I joined the others in a great big shout and sprinted straight towards the hill. We barely left the cover of the olive trees when all hell broke loose on us. Machine gun and rifle fire poured down on the hill towards us, and almost instantly, we were forced down into the rocky, hard soil. I hugged the ground and made myself as flat as I could, barely lifting my head to see what was happening around me. I raised my rifle and loosed a few shots towards the hill, not even seeing a target to shoot at, but simply to make myself feel better about this hell I was in. 



Suddenly, I heard someone shouting my name. “Absalom! Absalom!” I looked over and saw that Big Joe had gathered a few other Lincolners and was hiding behind a large rock. “We’ll cover you!” He shouted, before turning to the others and ordering them to start firing. As soon as they did, I shot up from the ground and found myself collapsing back down in a heap on the ground. My legs had failed me, and I’m not afraid to say that I wet myself in fear. 



“You can do it, Son!” Big Joe screamed, motioning for me to get up and run. I gripped the ground as I saw a puff of dirt shoot up into the air. A bullet had landed near me, and I knew more were going to follow if I didn’t move. I screamed as loud as I could and forced myself up from the ground, running over to the rock as fast as I could. When I made it behind the rock with Big Joe and the others, I was glad my rifle had come with a sling, since I most likely would’ve left it where I had been lying. 



I caught my breath with the others, noticing that they weren’t holding up much better than I was. A few of them were huddled behind the rock and screaming their heads off as bullets whizzed by the rock. Big Joe continued to pop his head up and fire back towards the hill; he was like a rabbit poking up and back down.  



It was obvious we couldn’t stay there forever; we had to try to reach the hill. There was a decline in the land a few feet away from the rock, which could act as a sort of trench for us. Big Joe ordered all of us to cover him while he ran towards it. He took off running, and we all quickly unloaded in the direction of the hill. I soon ran out of bullets in my magazine and quickly searched my belt pocket for ammunition to reload. Only to find out that the bullets that I had been assigned didn’t go to my fucking rifle. 



I looked around for any of the others, hoping that one of them might have the bullets for my Mauser. But before I could start to ask, Big Joe yelled out for us to join him at the ditch. Seeing as I was useless without any bullets, I shouldered my rifle and pulled out my Ruby pistol. I told the others behind the rock to cover me, and once they had all reloaded, they began firing towards the hill once again. I racked the slide of my pistol and took off in a full sprint towards Big Joe. As I left the safety of the rock, I suddenly found myself flying through the air. It all happened so fast that I had no time to process it. Only when I was slammed back down to the ground did I realize that an artillery shell had landed near me. 



“Absalom!” I heard Big Joe scream before a long, persistent ring overcame my ears. I looked around in a dazed confusion. I was suddenly lying flat down on the floor, and as I tried to push myself off the hard, rocky soil of the valley floor, another shell came whistling towards me. This time, I was completely conscious of the invisible force that lifted me and slammed me full force down to the ground, and soon the world was drowned in darkness. 



The next thing I knew, I was waking up in a soft bed, staring up at a stone ceiling. It didn’t hit me for a few more minutes that I had suddenly appeared in this new location. Slowly, I felt my whole body throb in pain, and when I lifted my right arm, which was the center of most of my pain, I discovered that I couldn’t see out of my right side. I thought I might have subconsciously been closing it, but no matter how hard I tried, no vision returned to it.



“Ah, our wayward soul is awake.” I heard a voice call out to me in Spanish. I looked around to see who it was, and to my surprise, I saw a priest walk across my room to my left side. He’s dressed in the typical dress of a priest, white collar and black suit. He had a long curly mustache and kind eyes, with a part in his brown sandy hair. 



“What am I doing here?” I asked, my voice sounded like gravel and sand mixed. It was then that I realized how thirsty I was. I coughed loudly, and when my spell finished, I saw that the priest had a cup of water waiting for me. Without even asking for it, he helped hold the glass up to my mouth and allowed me to drink. I don’t think I’ll ever again have a glass of water that quenched my thirst so thoroughly. 



I asked him what I was doing here, what day it was, and how I had even gotten here to begin with. He smiled gently and set the empty glass on a little nightstand next to my bed. The nightstand had my journal, my copy of *Das Kapital,* and my Ruby pistol. He held my hand and patted it.



“You are in my humble little church. My name is Father José. We found you badly wounded on the battlefield and brought you here to heal your wounds. Unfortunately, you’ve lost your right eye and several fingers from your right hand. We’ve patched you up the best we could. It’s been about three days since we found you.” He lowered his head and made the sign of the cross on his chest. 



I didn’t believe him. How could I have ended up here? Why hadn’t anyone in my squad brought me back to our lines? How could I have been unconscious for three straight days? But as I lifted my arm again to look at it, I noticed that once again I couldn’t see out of my right eye. Turning my head more, I saw that my hand was bandaged up, and when I tried to wiggle my fingers, I couldn’t feel a few of them. I turned to him and asked him if I was a prisoner of the Fascists. He couldn’t help but laugh and shake his head at me.



“No, my son. All are welcome here in my church. Be they Communists, Anarchists, Falangists, Carlists, anyone at all is welcome to recuperate here. We don’t have much to offer you, but we will ensure that you are taken care of.” He held my hand and gently squeezed it. I stared at him and nodded softly, mouthing a thanks to him.



“Father? Are you in here?” Another man’s voice asked. I turned to look and saw, to my horror, that another wounded man had stepped into my room. And he wore the red beret of one of the Fascist factions. He took one look at me and quickly began to reach into his pocket. I lunged my left arm to my nightstand and grabbed my pistol. We both pointed our weapons at each other and futilely pulled out triggers. The only noise that came from both of our weapons was a dull click.  



“Now, children. It’s a sin to murder in the house of the Lord. We’ve taken the liberty of confiscating your bullets. And as such, we would appreciate it if you refrain from trying to kill each other.” Father José stood up and walked over to the other man, pushing down on his arm and forcing him to lower his pistol.



“You’re keeping this fu-” The man looked at the priest before clearing his throat. “This communist here in the house of God? Have you lost your mind, Father?” The man asked, staring back at me with hatred in his eyes. I stared back at him with just as much, hoping that somehow a bullet would fly into his head. 



“We are, and we are keeping you here as well, Carlos. Now, please, let us return to your room.” The priest started leading the Fascist out of my room before he turned to me and waved goodbye. “Sister Maria will be here to clean and change your bandages soon, my son.” And with that, I was left alone. 



Writing with my left hand is quite difficult, and I hope that some of this is at least a little legible. I hope that when I’m patched up here, I can leave and not be held as some sort of prisoner. 



February 15th?, 1937: There’s something wrong with this church. Sister Maria came to change my bandages. She was dressed in a completely white garment, and I thought at first she was a ghost. I tried to talk to her in Spanish, but she didn’t utter a single word to me as she diligently did her work. And when she was finished, she stood up and gently bowed to me, before leaving me alone in my room. I was left alone for the rest of the day and further into today. I wondered if anyone would come to visit me when Father José entered my room and gave the sign of the cross towards me. I couldn’t help but roll my eyes, but I let it slide as he approached my bed and sat next to me. 



“We would be honored if you joined us in the chapel for mass, my son.” He smiled at me and awaited my answer. I told him I didn’t want to and would rather just stay in my room. He shook his head at me, and the smile slowly disappeared from his face. “If you don’t join us for mass, I’m afraid we will not feed you or give you medicine for your wounds. So again I ask you, will you join us at mass?” The smile again returned to his face. 



I figured something like this might happen. My eyes wandered over to my desk and landed on my copy of *Das Kapital*. I relented and said I would join them. Father José was ecstatic and beckoned me to follow him. He helped me stand up from bed and gently massaged my legs to lessen the pain they felt after three days of being in bed. As he walked ahead, I quickly snatched my book and followed after him. 



We walked through the candlelit stone hallways, past the pictures of the saints and other nonsense, before we arrived at the chapel. There were already several other wounded men sitting in the pews. Father José allowed me to sit in the far back, away from most others, since he explained I was the only communist in attendance. I sat down in my pew and picked up one of the prayer books, slipping *Das Kapital* into the book and starting to read. 



The sermon was said completely in Latin, and I couldn’t follow along at all. Instead, I focused completely on reading, only occasionally looking up to see what the others were doing. Many of them had rosaries clutched in front of them, gripping them tightly in prayer. One of these was Carlos, who had his head bowed in prayer and was frantically crossing himself as he mumbled several words. I rolled my eyes and continued to read my book, looking up at Father José as he held up the golden cross before all of us. 



Then came the time to magically turn their little wafers into the body of Jesus. He blessed them before the eucharist and invited anyone to come up and take the communion. Carlos got up and quickly bowed his head before Father José. As the priest said something in Latin, dipped the wafer in wine and offered it to Carlos. Carlos, however, stared up at Father José before standing up and quickly walking away from the altar. 



I thought nothing of it, continuing to read my book, before finally the mass ended and I was allowed to return to my room. I returned to bed, grunting in pain as my hand began to ache in dull pain. I spent the rest of the day alone, finishing writing down what had happened yesterday in my journal, when the door to my room opened and quickly closed. To my shock, it was Carlos. He wordlessly made his way over to my bed and sat down next to me. He took off his red beret, revealing a mess of black hair under it, and quickly rubbed it. I could tell he had no intentions of talking to me, and it was physically hard to talk to me. 



“There’s something wrong here.” He told me. “And you’re the only one who might believe me.” I stared at him for a moment before allowing him to continue. I would at least hear him out, to see if he was indeed telling the truth. 



“José didn’t say the prayer correctly, and then when he offered me the body of Christ, he didn’t refer to it as the body. He referred to it as the flesh of Christ.” I stared at him for a moment, doing my best not to laugh in his face. But he continued. “And that didn’t smell like wine at all. When I smelled it, it smelled like blood.” Now that got my attention. 



I asked him how he could tell. He lifted his bandaged left arm and waited for me to put it together that he must’ve known what blood smelled like. I asked him why a Fascist would even want to talk to a communist like me. 



“I’m not a godless Fascist, idiot. I’m a Carlist. We are fighting for the three most important things. God, the fatherland, and the king. And I know for a fact, as a good God-fearing Catholic, that what Father José said was not what a normal mass is like.” He stared at me for a moment before looking over to the door. He backed away from me and cleared his throat. “Good morning, Sister Maria.” 



I looked over and saw that the silent Nun had been staring at us from the door. It was a blank stare, but I could tell that she had heard most of what we had said. She entered my room and brought me a tray of food, setting it down on my bed, before wordlessly bowing her head and walking away and out of my room. 



“Maybe there is something wrong here,” I told Carlos, before staring at him. “Absalom.” I offered my left hand to him, and he looked at it before taking it with his right arm. We’ve made a small alliance to see what is going on here in this church. And to see if we can stop it.

The journal contains the account of her son, Erik Olson, who volunteered to fight with the XV International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. Throughout her entire life, she had never spoken of the journal’s contents, and it is only now, with her passing, that we can examine what her son experienced in Spain. The following letter is included with the journal, being taped to the inside cover of the journal.* 



December 15th, 1936: Dear Ma-Ma. I’m sorry that you must find out about this through a letter, but I knew that if I had tried to tell you in person, I would not be able to bring myself to leave. The call has gone out for volunteers to fight against the fascist menace in Spain. The Communist International has cried out for me, and I have to answer the call. 

You always tell me of Pa, and how the war scarred him and caused him to leave us. But this isn’t the same imperialist war that Pa fell into. This is a righteous fight, and I must go to where my heart is calling me towards, and the Spanish proletariat has screamed to the world for help, and while the capitalist powers turn their back on her, it’s up to me and others like me to answer the call. 

Know that I do this with a heavy heart, and hope that you can forgive your son for going off to war. 

Love always, Erik. 



*It’s believed that Erik managed to bribe entry onto a steamer headed for Spain and arrived in January 1937. From here onward, the story that he recorded in his journal. Take note, that the majority of the Spanish included in the journal have been translated for easier reading.*  
  


January 15th, 1937: Finally arrived in Valencia! The city is abuzz with activity, and armed workers patrol the streets. I managed to buy this journal off a miner who eagerly came up to me, wondering if I was a part of the International Brigades. We began to chat, and I must be thankful that I took those years of Spanish in university. It seems like fate that it came in handy. The miner explained to me that the Fascists were currently attacking Madrid and that, through the bravery of the workers of Madrid and the foreign volunteers, that the Fascists were being held at bay. 



This is wonderful news! And shows that the proletariat can defend itself against the arms and tactics of the Fascists. The miner sold me his journal for only a few céntimos and a promise that when the war was won, we’d get together and have a few drinks. With my journal secured I headed to the headquarters of the Communist Party of Spain. I was hoping that they would be able to tell me where I was to go, now that I had set foot in Spain.



The Headquarters was a mess of people running around with papers and explaining back and forth about what was happening. It took me a few minutes to finally get the attention of a party comrade and inquire about where I was meant to go. The scruffy looking man with thick glasses and a big beard quickly dropped the papers he was holding and grabbed me by the arms. He thanked me for coming and quickly took me to the back offices. He explained his name was Jorge, and was elated that I had come to Spain. He explained that another International Brigade was being set up, which included mostly Americans and English. He explained to me that they were being mustered in Albacete and that he would eagerly arrange transport for me. 



I’m writing now from a hotel room that the party comrades have set up for me until the transport can be arranged. I must admit, the nerves are starting to set in, and I’m beginning to wonder if this was the right choice of action to make. But then I think back to all those comrades outside in the street. They scream and shout the same phrase, ¡No Pasarán! They shall not pass. If Fascism is to be stopped here in Spain, I must join them. 



January 17th, 1937: Finally arrived here in Albacete. The journey was some of the worst driving I’ve ever seen from anyone. Partly from the old Ford pickup that I was driven in, but also the absolute abominable state of the roads in Spain. We were lucky if we were able to drive on a smooth section of road for more than an hour or so. My driver, a salty peasant named Benito, didn’t talk to me much at all during the journey. He seemed only to be doing this because the party comrades had paid him to do so. 



Despite the terrible state of the roads, Spain is a truly beautiful country. The mountains are rugged, and even in January, the days are still warm, and even the cold nights, there’s just something so special, if even magical, about this beautiful country. The fields are full of peasants who have taken the land over from their landlords, at long last fulfilling their dreams of owning a piece of land just for themselves. What little Benito did say was that he was happy to finally have land to work for himself instead of his boss. 



When at long last we arrived at Albacete, I was overjoyed to see other Americans there. I was worried that perhaps I was the only comrade who had arrived from the New World. But I was elated to see others. I even have made the acquaintance of the British volunteers, who, despite their posh accents, have the same goals towards saving Spain from Fascism. I am slightly disturbed, however, that I’m one of the only ones who can understand Spanish at all. Some of the Brits can speak French well enough, but there’s a big leap between the two languages, and I worry about communication during battle. 



But for now, I’ve settled into the barracks of Albacete and now await the time when the Brigade is fully constituted and can go to the fight against the Fascists. The news from the front is a chorus of contradictions. Some say the Fascist columns of Franco and Mola have been thrown back in full retreat from Madrid, while others say that the city is mere days from falling. Whichever is true, if either of them is, I hope that we can arrive in time to turn the tide. 



January 18th, 1937: I’ve gotten to know a few of the fellow International brigaders, and I’m amazed at the different types of people I’ve been exposed to. A few like me are college-educated kids who also heeded the call of Moscow to fight against Fascism here in Spain. Some are refugees from countries where their parties have been banned and prosecuted, a few Yugoslavs, Greeks, and Bulgars. 



To me, the most interesting character in the American camp is Big Joe. A great big Appalachian man, who not only is a veteran from The Great War but is also a veteran from the coal wars and the battle of Balir Mountain. He’s one of the very few professional soldiers that exist amongst us, and that’s made him quite popular with the rest of us. Despite being barely able to read or write his own name, he has a deep sense of wisdom and knowledge that the rest of us educated fools don’t seem to have. 



I feel slightly out of place, being the youngest out of most of my fellow brigaders, but I’m sure that in time, a bond will develop between us all. Afterall, we’re all here for one thing, and that’s to spread the revolution and defend it. 



January 20th, 1937: The past few days have been spent waiting for weapons to arrive to arm us, and in the meantime, we have become set up here in Albacete and have finally been fully organized into the XV International Brigade. The Americans have been formed into a battalion, and we quickly agreed to name it the Lincoln Battalion. Who better than the great emancipator to name our group fighting for freedom? While it isn’t official yet, the battalions and companies have more or less coalesced into what we will be organized into. 



The Irish have been making a big fuss over possibly being organized with the Brits. There’s still bad blood from the Irish war, and they refuse to be attached to the British Battalion. Apparently, they’d rather be attached to our battalion, which would make sense. A few of the other comrades in the Lincoln are of Irish descent, so it would make sense to have them serve with us. Other Irish would rather stay with the French contingent. All in all, there’s maybe about 1,000 to 1,500 of us so far, with more trickling in. 



There are still no signs of the weapons we are to be assigned, which worries me. There’s already rumbling through camp that we might be going into action soon. I struggle to see how we can fight Fascism without rifles or bullets. For now, our training consists of learning to march in step with each other and practicing with sticks on how to properly hold the rifles that are hopefully on the way soon. The rest of the time is spent reminding us of Communist Party doctrine and extolling the virtues of Comrade Stalin. We’ve even been given copies of both the manifesto and *Das Kapital*. 



I’d be lying to myself if I didn’t mention that I miss home. And wonder how Ma-Ma is handling things, knowing that I left her back home without saying goodbye in person. I think to myself that perhaps it would’ve been better to tell her in person, but I know that she would’ve talked me out of coming here to Spain. 

A part of me wishes that she had told me to stay home. 



January 25th, 1937: The promised weapons have arrived at long last, and I’ve never seen a sorrier excuse for weapons in all my days. They range from old Spanish Mausers, which is what I received, to French Berthiers, Austrian Mannlichers, and a few Russian Mosins. How are we supposed to keep track of all these different ammunition? Some share similar calibers like the different versions of Spanish Mausers, but the others all require specific rounds. In the heat of battle, how can one hope to keep the rounds correct to his gun? 



I count myself lucky that I was given a Spanish Mauser. Even if it’s most likely older than I am, and the wood is worn and cracked in a few places, it seems like a fine weapon all things considered, and the ammunition will hopefully be plentiful. I am, however, worried about the pistol I was also given. It's a Ruby pistol, and I can’t help but hear the French snicker every time I practice with it. Seems that a few of the French comrades have experience with the Ruby, and they suggest I use it as a club instead of relying on it as a pistol. So far, I haven’t encountered any problems with it, but that feeling nags at me in the back of my head every time I look down at it. 



Training is now proceeding well enough, but it’s not at all what I expected. I was given a couple of boxes of Mauser rounds and told to practice with my rifle. I wasn’t shown how to clean, use the sights, or anything. We’re lucky enough to have a few Great War veterans to try and show us the ropes, but it’s almost laughable how bad shots most of us are, myself included. Hopefully, with more practice, I can be somewhat helpful to my comrades. 



January 27th, 1937: Training continues, with mixed results across the board. I’m getting the hang of the Mauser, but sighting it has become a hassle. The old rusted metal can become knocked out of place and has to constantly be put back into place. Our Machine gun detachment has been having better luck, but they have so few bullets to spare that they can only expend a few rounds each time. 



The questions about our uniforms were finally answered today. The commissars passed around clothes that bear the colors of the republican flag: red, yellow, and dark purple. I thought at first that they had simply made little flags for us to wrap around our arms, but they are meant to wrap around our arms to show that we are Republican fighters. Other than that, we haven’t received any sort of standard uniform, and we also haven’t been given any hermelts either, which greatly upsets Big Joe. He’s been warning about the dangers of shrapnel to anyone who will listen to him. 



The food is also starting to get on my nerves. A few times, we haven’t even been given food. And the few times we do get it, it’s always the same. Rice and beans, mixed all together with a cup of bad coffee. Several of the Lincolns desperately miss any sort of meat. We’ve left the barracks and tried to procure meat from the city itself, but even there, meat is scarce. There’s been talk about going out into the country to ‘requisition’ some animals for meat, but we’d be no better than the Fascist bandits if we did so. 



It’s better just to eat the food that comes to us. If we devolve into thieves and brigands, what makes us better than Franco’s forces? I believe we must be better than they are, and we must set an example for all others who might follow us. 



I’ve also decided on a *nom de guerre*. Several of the Lincolns have one, and I felt that I should have one as well. While I haven’t read the bible since I was a child, one name has always stood out to me. And so, for the duration of the war and until I arrive home, call me Absalom. 



January 30th, 1937: There’s been quite a bit of buzz around camp that we might be shipped out to Madrid. I am, however, concerned by this. Not only for the fear of battle finally approaching, but also that I feel that not only I, but the entire brigade is woefully unprepared to go into battle. Most of us are still no better with our rifles than when they first arrived, and there’s a severe lack of progress made with any actual training. 



Big Joe has been trying to pick up the slack that the commisars have shown towards training. He’s been showing us how to fight in a squad and has been acting almost as a drill sergeant of sorts. He’s also far and wide the best shot in the whole brigade, even winning a makeshift contest we made to see who could hit the most targets the fastest. He’s shown me how to at least try to clean my rifle and ensure that it continues to work. As payment, I offered to teach him how to read, though he simply smiled and told me that many had already tried and failed to do so. 



As night approached today, I heard singing and laughing coming from the Irish detachment camp. The Irish assigned to the Lincoln Battalion have taken the name of a leader during the Easter Rising, calling themselves the Connolly Column. I was on sentry duty and was struggling to stay awake when I heard singing from a small fire near their camp. Leaving my post to investigate, I came upon about 10 or so members of the column sitting around the fire and laughing and singing.



They invited me to join them, and after assuring me that no one would care that I left my post, I decided to sit down with them and listen as they sang traditional Irish songs. One of their members, Bill Henry, was playing a small guitar while another member, Bill Beattie, gave the lyrics to the song. A few of the Irish offered me swigs of whiskey, but I politely refused, happy to just sit by the warm fire and enjoy their company. Soon, they started singing a song that was somewhat familiar to me. 



It had the same tune that ‘When Johnny Comes Marching Home’ has, but has different lyrics. And while the Connolly boys were giggling and singing along, I couldn’t help but pay attention to the lyrics of the song. A song about a woman who finds her old lover back from war, horribly mutilated. And yet despite that, she still loves him. 



*I’m happy for to see ya home, hurroo, hurroo*

*I’m happy for to see ya home, hurroo, hurroo*

*Oh, I’m happy for to see ya home*

*From the island of Ceylon*

*Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ya*



I can’t help but hope that Ma-Ma will think the same thing of me when I come home from all this. Even if I lose an arm or a leg. Though hopefully I don’t end up an armless, boneless, chickenless egg. 



February 2nd, 1937: We’ve arrived at Madrid! The city is in desperate need of reinforcements, and so we’ve arrived to shore up the barricades against the Fascist waves. We arrived to a heroes' welcome from the people of Madrid. They tossed flowers at us, and the girls came up to kiss us and thank us for coming to save them. The city has been damaged from the previous battles, and yet the spirit of the people of Madrid remains unbroken. 



They sing and dance and wave the red flags; it all seems like a fairy tale to me. I can only imagine that this is what life in the great Soviet Union must be like. Large pictures of both Stalin and Lenin are hanging from buildings, along with the Spanish Prime Minister Largo Caballero. It seems impossible that the Fascists can break this ring of iron, and I’m more than happy to aid in its defense. Hopefully, there will also be better food options here than in Albacete. 



February 6th, 1937: Battle! The Fascists have struck south of Madrid near the Jarama River! It seems like they want to cut the road from Valencia to Madrid, and if they succeed, Madrid will have its only supply line cut. Already, the XI and XIV International Brigades are there and have taken the brunt of the attack. 



We are expected to join them in a few days. The excitement is palpable, and it seems that any fear I may have has been taken away from me with this news that we will now have a battle at last. But I also worry about our level of training. Many of us still aren’t fully trained, and our rifles are still a mix of calibers. 



Tonight I heard shots ringing out in the city. I wondered if perhaps the Fascists had already penetrated this far into the city, but as I poked my head outside my window, I saw that it was executions. Priests were being led out from their church, just across the street from where we were stationed, and being executed by Spanish soldiers. 



Marx described the church and religion as the opium of the masses. And the Catholic church is nothing if not an archaic relic that belongs in the past. It is the church and the landlords that held a stranglehold on the peasants and workers of Spain. Still, seeing these priests silently kneeling and praying as a pistol is placed to their heads is a haunting sight. This is my first view of war, and while the church must be swept aside for Spain to be free truly, I can’t get the image out of my head. 



February 7th, 1937: Wounded have begun to arrive in Madrid from the battle. Many of them are our brothers in the other International Brigades. There’s talk that Franco has managed to reach the banks of the Jarama. There’s talk of us going into battle tomorrow, or even later in the day, but for now, our orders are to stay in camp and await the orders. More priests were shot today. This time, they also dragged a nun outside. I didn’t see what they did to her, but her screams were enough to give me an idea. 



Food has been getting harder to stomach. We’re now down to a plate of bread and chickpeas. I never thought I’d miss the beans and rice that I had grown so tired of. With battle so close now, I find it difficult to document my feelings; no word holds the right impact. I’m afraid. And for the first time, I’ve begun to truly question if I made the right choice. 



It’s started to rain here. 



February 8th, 1937: The battle has come to a halt, and the rain has swollen the banks of the Jarama. I’m almost thankful, and hope that the battle will not continue. But I know that I signed to fight. 



More priests were executed, along with more nuns. I watched as the commissars oversaw the executions, and I could see that they were enjoying what they were doing. Is this what I signed up for? 



“You can’t make a revolution in white gloves.” Comrade Lenin once said. And while I know this to be true, I can’t help but wonder if this is necessary. I asked a few of the other Lincolns what their thoughts about it were, but they were just as conflicted as I am. A few of them declared that this was a necessary step for the revolution. Others were disgusted and hoped that it would stop. 



I miss, Ma-Ma. 



*The Following entry is noted for having worse handwriting than usual. Perhaps because Absalom was writing this while on a truck bound for Jarama.* 



February 11th, 1937: The Fascists are across the river! They’ve somehow managed to get across the river and are now fighting their way towards the Valencia road. At last, we’re being mobilized to throw them back across the river. 



The fear and nerves continue to plague me, but the excitement is infectious as we begin to drive towards Jarama. Big Joe has been checking on all of us constantly, ensuring that we keep our weapons dry and our fingers away from the trigger. In the terrible Spanish roads, it’s a wonder how none of our rifles have gone off accidentally from all the thrashing. 



All day we’ve seen Soviet made planes flying overhead, and I can’t help but smile at seeing the comrades controlling the skies above. The Spaniards call the Soviet monoplanes""Moscas,"" meaning ""flies."" And the comparison isn’t far off. They seem so small and agile, I can’t help but imagine a giant flying insect when a few of them fly overhead. 



Already now, the rumbling of artillery and the cracks of rifle fire are getting closer and closer as we arrive near Jarama. I can’t help but be thankful that I didn’t get a bite to eat before we left Madrid. My stomach is hurting so badly that I’m almost certain that I would’ve thrown up by now. A few of the others in the back of the truck have already done so. 



The truck has come to a stop at last, and we’ve all been ordered to disembark. A few wounded have streamed past us. And a few dead as well. A few members of the XI brigade came to meet us as we disembarked, and they told us how badly the fighting at the front was. 



We aren’t going to the front yet, as the rest of the XV still needs to arrive with us, but all I can say now is that I’m scared. And the rumbling of artillery and the cracking of machine gun fire is louder than ever. 



*From here till the end of the journal, the handwriting is noticeably worse.* 



February 14th?, 1937: Where do I begin? Perhaps at the attack. More like a slaughter. The Commisars told us that our attack would be against the hill called the Pingarrón that had changed hands countless times already. A squad of British machine gunners had held it until they were driven off it by bayonet point. Now it was our turn to charge against it and retake it. They said that tanks, artillery, and even airplanes would come to aid us in the attack. Lying bastards. 



We formed up in a group of olive trees, keeping low to avoid sniper fire. When the loud, shrill whistle broke the silence, I joined the others in a great big shout and sprinted straight towards the hill. We barely left the cover of the olive trees when all hell broke loose on us. Machine gun and rifle fire poured down on the hill towards us, and almost instantly, we were forced down into the rocky, hard soil. I hugged the ground and made myself as flat as I could, barely lifting my head to see what was happening around me. I raised my rifle and loosed a few shots towards the hill, not even seeing a target to shoot at, but simply to make myself feel better about this hell I was in. 



Suddenly, I heard someone shouting my name. “Absalom! Absalom!” I looked over and saw that Big Joe had gathered a few other Lincolners and was hiding behind a large rock. “We’ll cover you!” He shouted, before turning to the others and ordering them to start firing. As soon as they did, I shot up from the ground and found myself collapsing back down in a heap on the ground. My legs had failed me, and I’m not afraid to say that I wet myself in fear. 



“You can do it, Son!” Big Joe screamed, motioning for me to get up and run. I gripped the ground as I saw a puff of dirt shoot up into the air. A bullet had landed near me, and I knew more were going to follow if I didn’t move. I screamed as loud as I could and forced myself up from the ground, running over to the rock as fast as I could. When I made it behind the rock with Big Joe and the others, I was glad my rifle had come with a sling, since I most likely would’ve left it where I had been lying. 



I caught my breath with the others, noticing that they weren’t holding up much better than I was. A few of them were huddled behind the rock and screaming their heads off as bullets whizzed by the rock. Big Joe continued to pop his head up and fire back towards the hill; he was like a rabbit poking up and back down.  



It was obvious we couldn’t stay there forever; we had to try to reach the hill. There was a decline in the land a few feet away from the rock, which could act as a sort of trench for us. Big Joe ordered all of us to cover him while he ran towards it. He took off running, and we all quickly unloaded in the direction of the hill. I soon ran out of bullets in my magazine and quickly searched my belt pocket for ammunition to reload. Only to find out that the bullets that I had been assigned didn’t go to my fucking rifle. 



I looked around for any of the others, hoping that one of them might have the bullets for my Mauser. But before I could start to ask, Big Joe yelled out for us to join him at the ditch. Seeing as I was useless without any bullets, I shouldered my rifle and pulled out my Ruby pistol. I told the others behind the rock to cover me, and once they had all reloaded, they began firing towards the hill once again. I racked the slide of my pistol and took off in a full sprint towards Big Joe. As I left the safety of the rock, I suddenly found myself flying through the air. It all happened so fast that I had no time to process it. Only when I was slammed back down to the ground did I realize that an artillery shell had landed near me. 



“Absalom!” I heard Big Joe scream before a long, persistent ring overcame my ears. I looked around in a dazed confusion. I was suddenly lying flat down on the floor, and as I tried to push myself off the hard, rocky soil of the valley floor, another shell came whistling towards me. This time, I was completely conscious of the invisible force that lifted me and slammed me full force down to the ground, and soon the world was drowned in darkness. 



The next thing I knew, I was waking up in a soft bed, staring up at a stone ceiling. It didn’t hit me for a few more minutes that I had suddenly appeared in this new location. Slowly, I felt my whole body throb in pain, and when I lifted my right arm, which was the center of most of my pain, I discovered that I couldn’t see out of my right side. I thought I might have subconsciously been closing it, but no matter how hard I tried, no vision returned to it.



“Ah, our wayward soul is awake.” I heard a voice call out to me in Spanish. I looked around to see who it was, and to my surprise, I saw a priest walk across my room to my left side. He’s dressed in the typical dress of a priest, white collar and black suit. He had a long curly mustache and kind eyes, with a part in his brown sandy hair. 



“What am I doing here?” I asked, my voice sounded like gravel and sand mixed. It was then that I realized how thirsty I was. I coughed loudly, and when my spell finished, I saw that the priest had a cup of water waiting for me. Without even asking for it, he helped hold the glass up to my mouth and allowed me to drink. I don’t think I’ll ever again have a glass of water that quenched my thirst so thoroughly. 



I asked him what I was doing here, what day it was, and how I had even gotten here to begin with. He smiled gently and set the empty glass on a little nightstand next to my bed. The nightstand had my journal, my copy of *Das Kapital,* and my Ruby pistol. He held my hand and patted it.



“You are in my humble little church. My name is Father José. We found you badly wounded on the battlefield and brought you here to heal your wounds. Unfortunately, you’ve lost your right eye and several fingers from your right hand. We’ve patched you up the best we could. It’s been about three days since we found you.” He lowered his head and made the sign of the cross on his chest. 



I didn’t believe him. How could I have ended up here? Why hadn’t anyone in my squad brought me back to our lines? How could I have been unconscious for three straight days? But as I lifted my arm again to look at it, I noticed that once again I couldn’t see out of my right eye. Turning my head more, I saw that my hand was bandaged up, and when I tried to wiggle my fingers, I couldn’t feel a few of them. I turned to him and asked him if I was a prisoner of the Fascists. He couldn’t help but laugh and shake his head at me.



“No, my son. All are welcome here in my church. Be they Communists, Anarchists, Falangists, Carlists, anyone at all is welcome to recuperate here. We don’t have much to offer you, but we will ensure that you are taken care of.” He held my hand and gently squeezed it. I stared at him and nodded softly, mouthing a thanks to him.



“Father? Are you in here?” Another man’s voice asked. I turned to look and saw, to my horror, that another wounded man had stepped into my room. And he wore the red beret of one of the Fascist factions. He took one look at me and quickly began to reach into his pocket. I lunged my left arm to my nightstand and grabbed my pistol. We both pointed our weapons at each other and futilely pulled out triggers. The only noise that came from both of our weapons was a dull click.  



“Now, children. It’s a sin to murder in the house of the Lord. We’ve taken the liberty of confiscating your bullets. And as such, we would appreciate it if you refrain from trying to kill each other.” Father José stood up and walked over to the other man, pushing down on his arm and forcing him to lower his pistol.



“You’re keeping this fu-” The man looked at the priest before clearing his throat. “This communist here in the house of God? Have you lost your mind, Father?” The man asked, staring back at me with hatred in his eyes. I stared back at him with just as much, hoping that somehow a bullet would fly into his head. 



“We are, and we are keeping you here as well, Carlos. Now, please, let us return to your room.” The priest started leading the Fascist out of my room before he turned to me and waved goodbye. “Sister Maria will be here to clean and change your bandages soon, my son.” And with that, I was left alone. 



Writing with my left hand is quite difficult, and I hope that some of this is at least a little legible. I hope that when I’m patched up here, I can leave and not be held as some sort of prisoner. 



February 15th?, 1937: There’s something wrong with this church. Sister Maria came to change my bandages. She was dressed in a completely white garment, and I thought at first she was a ghost. I tried to talk to her in Spanish, but she didn’t utter a single word to me as she diligently did her work. And when she was finished, she stood up and gently bowed to me, before leaving me alone in my room. I was left alone for the rest of the day and further into today. I wondered if anyone would come to visit me when Father José entered my room and gave the sign of the cross towards me. I couldn’t help but roll my eyes, but I let it slide as he approached my bed and sat next to me. 



“We would be honored if you joined us in the chapel for mass, my son.” He smiled at me and awaited my answer. I told him I didn’t want to and would rather just stay in my room. He shook his head at me, and the smile slowly disappeared from his face. “If you don’t join us for mass, I’m afraid we will not feed you or give you medicine for your wounds. So again I ask you, will you join us at mass?” The smile again returned to his face. 



I figured something like this might happen. My eyes wandered over to my desk and landed on my copy of *Das Kapital*. I relented and said I would join them. Father José was ecstatic and beckoned me to follow him. He helped me stand up from bed and gently massaged my legs to lessen the pain they felt after three days of being in bed. As he walked ahead, I quickly snatched my book and followed after him. 



We walked through the candlelit stone hallways, past the pictures of the saints and other nonsense, before we arrived at the chapel. There were already several other wounded men sitting in the pews. Father José allowed me to sit in the far back, away from most others, since he explained I was the only communist in attendance. I sat down in my pew and picked up one of the prayer books, slipping *Das Kapital* into the book and starting to read. 



The sermon was said completely in Latin, and I couldn’t follow along at all. Instead, I focused completely on reading, only occasionally looking up to see what the others were doing. Many of them had rosaries clutched in front of them, gripping them tightly in prayer. One of these was Carlos, who had his head bowed in prayer and was frantically crossing himself as he mumbled several words. I rolled my eyes and continued to read my book, looking up at Father José as he held up the golden cross before all of us. 



Then came the time to magically turn their little wafers into the body of Jesus. He blessed them before the eucharist and invited anyone to come up and take the communion. Carlos got up and quickly bowed his head before Father José. As the priest said something in Latin, dipped the wafer in wine and offered it to Carlos. Carlos, however, stared up at Father José before standing up and quickly walking away from the altar. 



I thought nothing of it, continuing to read my book, before finally the mass ended and I was allowed to return to my room. I returned to bed, grunting in pain as my hand began to ache in dull pain. I spent the rest of the day alone, finishing writing down what had happened yesterday in my journal, when the door to my room opened and quickly closed. To my shock, it was Carlos. He wordlessly made his way over to my bed and sat down next to me. He took off his red beret, revealing a mess of black hair under it, and quickly rubbed it. I could tell he had no intentions of talking to me, and it was physically hard to talk to me. 



“There’s something wrong here.” He told me. “And you’re the only one who might believe me.” I stared at him for a moment before allowing him to continue. I would at least hear him out, to see if he was indeed telling the truth. 



“José didn’t say the prayer correctly, and then when he offered me the body of Christ, he didn’t refer to it as the body. He referred to it as the flesh of Christ.” I stared at him for a moment, doing my best not to laugh in his face. But he continued. “And that didn’t smell like wine at all. When I smelled it, it smelled like blood.” Now that got my attention. 



I asked him how he could tell. He lifted his bandaged left arm and waited for me to put it together that he must’ve known what blood smelled like. I asked him why a Fascist would even want to talk to a communist like me. 



“I’m not a godless Fascist, idiot. I’m a Carlist. We are fighting for the three most important things. God, the fatherland, and the king. And I know for a fact, as a good God-fearing Catholic, that what Father José said was not what a normal mass is like.” He stared at me for a moment before looking over to the door. He backed away from me and cleared his throat. “Good morning, Sister Maria.” 



I looked over and saw that the silent Nun had been staring at us from the door. It was a blank stare, but I could tell that she had heard most of what we had said. She entered my room and brought me a tray of food, setting it down on my bed, before wordlessly bowing her head and walking away and out of my room.

OK so you have ME 34, 2 bothers, (fake names) Pat 26, and the other 30, lets call him Matt...and our mom. Things have been pretty off for awhile with our mom. Conversations keep leading to arguments, none of us feels heard and it always ends up with my mom in tears telling us, Matt is always starting stuff when we all see its clearly her. Typical vibe a lot of boomer parents seem to be stuck in these days. Anyway a few months ago we're all like ma, we can't keep doing this so unless you go to counseling we're gonna limit contact with you. So she agrees ( which kinda made us surprised but we were like 'hey we'll take it'!
Fast forward a few weeks and suddenly counseling is all she talks about. Like telling us he's the best counselor ever and she keeps thanking us for telling her to try it. 
Then... slowly over the weeks, random comments start slipping out. I went for breakfast with her and super casual she says "" my counselor believes Matt is a narcissist"" I was speechless like whaaaat? Weird thing to casually drop over coffee. I answered i dont think so ma, but she interrupts and says "" I'm telling you my counselor says has all the signs, and also my counselor  is pretty sure Pat is probably manic, you know there's some great medication for that"" and then continues in the same breath, how lucky she is to have me the 'stable' one...
So I've done therapy and im aware im a people pleaser and im working on that so I don't really talk back to her, so now im sitting here like, what's going on? Mind you, her counselor has never met any of us. Side note: since our dad's passing Matt has been in therapy and he's such an amazing brother. So is Pat! I'm a single mom of 3 and they are both here helping me every week!
 
Anyway, I said to my mom after her diagnosis rant ""i don't thinks that right and diagnosing someone without meeting them is wild."" She got mad at me and told me im not a specialist so I don't know more than him. Oh and we had 2 more family dinners were when we tried to talk to her about how we feel she gets up, starts doing dishes and says she has to talk to her counselor before answering us. Apparently he says she can come back weekly to discuss everything she talks to us about. For the first time I had enough and I haven't answered any of her calls, neither have my brothers. My aunt tells me we're being cruel and to be nice because she's finally getting help, but her counselling sessions seemed to make things worst. So are we out of line for cutting her off?

I'm talking they assume he's hiding the fact he has multiple children or has been married previously theories. 

the oldest of my friends consistently is warning me that he's old enough to be looking at marriage and wanting children age so he's just gonna jump on that ASAP and refuses to listen when i try to tell her that we've spoken about that stuff and agreed if it gets to that point we're looking at at least a few years down the line. she also has said that when i graduate i should not move to be with him and that he should come be with me (were long distance temporarily we met as he was a loose friend of my older cousins) but after i told her that he's willing to move whenever i get my job since his job is easy to find anywhere she's quickly changed her tone and claims he's being too casual and making me make all the desicions. 

one of the three has met him once for coffee and the occasional hellos on the phone. one on one she's extremely supportive and thinks he's great but the second were in a group setting it's a total 180 and she hates his guts so i dont know where she stands. 

the other friend doesnt really care much she just thinks he's old and ugly. 

i have offered multiple times to have them meet him in person or call yet everyone refuses. they seem to believe nothing he says will fix their issues with him when only one has interacted and after raved privately to me about how nice and easy to chat with her was. truly it feels like the oldest is the leader of this chaos, she refuses to talk to him until i have a ring but would never approve of him if he didn't talk to her about it first.

i know their opinions mean nothing especially when my whole family adores him as well as the fact that i look at him like he's hung the moon and stars but it hurts how unsupportive my friends are of my relationship especially when theirs are nothing but chaotic messes. 

I'm so lost and dont know what to do. this has been an issue with them regarding previous boyfriend's I've had yet after various times trying to get them to stop automatically judging everyone it's persisted. ",0,1769914255.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False
1qsmfnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1qsmfnz/mystery_issues_with_heart_rate/,Mystery Issues with heart rate,"29F 5'9 198 pounds. 

I have had high blood pressure and been on medication since early twenties. Every single family member of mine on both sides has is I was doomed from the start. Metroprolol ER 25 mg daily. I never miss a dose. My BP is usually around 140/95 while taking it. It's been that way since I started meds a few years ago. 

Previous PCOS diagnosis that is currently untreated. 
Was prediabetic on blood work a few yesrs ago, but I am not now. I get stuck in the line of good and prediabetic risk. 
Recent blood work has shown nothing, been told it's all normal. 

Smoker, but on track to be fully nicotine free by summer. Daily use varies but I only use 2-3 packs max per week. (I was half a pack daily at my worst)

Had COVID in 2021, it did mess me up I've had trouble catching my breath ever since and my sense of smell never returned. Brain fog has been bad since then as well. 

Diet is fair, I took better control of my eating habits in the last year. I eat out 1-2x per week, try to avoid fast food. I do eat it on rare occasions but most days I eat rice, eggs, raw veggies, chicken, seaweed, soup. I make what I can from scratch including butter, sauces, soup broth. I do like an occasional sweet treat but nothing like what I was doing last year where I'd have a candy bar before bed or a bag of Doritos with sweet tea and then eat a protein bar at 2 am. I was prediabetic 3 years ago, I have since gotten out of that threshold now it just tetters the line between safe and prediabetic for reasons I'm not sure why. Assuming PCOS issue given my diet change.

Caffeine isn't crazy, I have 1 cup of coffee which I dilute with decaf.I have a glass of sweet tea or a soda with a meal some days but otherwise I stick to water. 

Exercise is moderate. I started going to the gym two years ago and do low impact stuff due to an old ACL injury and it's difficult to do anything that gets my heart rate up without feeling like I will pass out. Swimming mostly. Occasional I walk on the treadmill. Trying to build up stamina I swim and do water aerobics 2-5x weekly. Not sure what im doing incorrectly as I have been holding a steady weight between 195-200 for years even before I started going to the gym. 

The last few weeks my heart has felt like it's beating really hard. Like I ran up and down some stairs but constantly. It's the worst when I wake up either from bed or a nap, but it's remains constant throughout the day. I have felt this before when I got on the BP meds. 

I did see a doctor who performed an EKG that was normal. BP was the usual 140/95. Pulse/HR 100. Said I am not having a heart attack or a stroke so that's good. He wants to give me another zio monitor but thinks this has something to do with an iron deficiency or my thyroid. He completely ignored me asking if my PCOS could be playing a part given it's untreated. He ignored me.  I asked if we could try maybe increasing my meds or a new medication. He said maybe? 

Now mind you, I had a zio monitor a few years ago. It showed nothing. I had my thyroid and iron checked 3x in the past few years, it's always normal. I know I'm not a doctor but I am CERTAIN it's not my thyroid. I am seeing a new doctor next week who may listen a little more to my history and concerns. 

I'm just curious on others opinions in what could be causing this sudden change feeling like my heart is beating too harsh? Is it something I'm not thinking of? Is it just a need to increase BP meds or try a new one? Is it PCOS related? Long COVID?

I started lifestyle changes years ago and and still working on a healthier lifestyle every day but nothing seems to change in my body and my issues just get worse like this or persist.

I say ""oh nice you found some cyanescens, you over in Seattle?""

He says ""no dude I'm in my front yard"".  His front yard is all wood chips with some raised beds and lots of veggies. 

280 miles inland from the coast.  Basically we are a few miles from Idaho.  

We couldn't believe it.  We eventually realized where they came from.  I had gotten 4oz of them on a trade from a buddy in Oregon late fall of 2023. We brought them over to buddies place and ground them up in a coffee grinder and put them all into capsules.  

So we figure the spores from grinding them up either floated out his front door or came out on his clothes and body while gardening.  They must have germinated in the spring and grew all summer and bam, fall 2024 they were popping up on the shady side of a raised bed near, under, and around a fabric pot he had been watering heavily all summer.  

So that fall after they seemed done we brought wood chips inside in bins and added more fresh chips to the area.  They fruited alllll winter in those tubs in his basement near his bedroom window.  We watched all summer of 2025 and the mycelium seemed to be spreading and happy.  This fall, they returned!  Second season harvesting from this spot.  We brought myceliated chips inside and again they're fruiting in the basement next to the window.  

Here are some pics of outdoor fruits this far inland.  And some indoors in the trays.  We don't have the humidity right so the caps haven't been opening well but we got a humidifier set up today so hopefully helping w that issue.  ",21,1769914073.0,WavyCap,8,1.0,False

1qsmd73,https://i.redd.it/uxhfb4q0rsgg1.jpeg,January low-buy reflection,"This was my first real attempt at a low-buy. January I aimed for 2 total clothing and/or accessories/shoes (down from average 5-8/month); dining out 2x/week or less (not including coffee, down from 3-4x/week); and staying within envelope budgets for all spends. 

Hot pink = no buy at all;
Green sticker with heart = only bought coffee out but bought nothing else that day;
Green sticker = allowed buy;
Orange sticker = unallowed buy or beyond envelope budget.

My living situation was upended mid-month and I've been crashing somewhere where I had no means to make coffee, that's why there are almost two weeks straight of coffee-only days. If it wasn't for that situation I would have had 11 days straight of hot pink stickers!!!

In all I only had 8 no buy days. 
I had 14 coffee-only days. 
I had 4 over-envelope splurges. 
I only had one week where I ate out more than 2x, which is a huge improvement. 
I bought 3 total clothing and accessories which is also a huge improvement. One thing I bought, I've been wanting for about 3 months, and it finally came back in stock. I had enough money left over from all my other envelopes to cover the expense but it was the third thing I bought and was also over the envelope budget. It is a handmade, slow-fashion piece, and I am really happy with it, and I am really happy with overall how mindful the purchase was---3 months of reflecting on it, and not putting the purchase on credit/debt but covering it with my monthly extras. This embodies how I would like my clothing purchases to continue to be. 

I got myself into my new place this weekend, where there is a coffee maker. I am feeling proud and impressed with how much less I spent by cutting back eating out and buying clothes. I plan to make a new chart for February and aim for 14 fully no-buy days this time. I will keep my other rules for now---they are quite challenging for me but not so restrictive that I give up completely. 

Thanks to this sub for all the inspiration to do better.

I previously worked in optometry - that’s truly my passion and hope to pivot back into that line of work in the future. My mom passed away last August. I’m hoping to leave my current state of residence for a Northern state, possibly anything around New England. 

I’m 5’6, blue eyes, brown hair, pale complexion, and I have a cute little tummy to protect my organs 🙈 I don’t have any tattoos or piercings besides my ears, but I’m totally fine if you do. Also, if you have a mustache….count me in 💕

I would definitely describe myself as a nerd, but it’s hard to narrow down the exact genre when I love so many things 😂 I’m absolutely a crafty girl. I enjoy painting and sewing. I would love to get into ceramics and woodworking. I’m always trying to learn something new, even if it’s silly. I love a good documentary or driving around town with an iced coffee listening to a podcast. 

I prefer activity dates over dinner dates. Dinner is nice occasionally - but playing board games/cards, going for walk, shooting hoops, blowing through a bucket of golf balls, bowling, go carts, and artsy stuff is wayyyy cool ☺️ and yessss, whatever hobbies you’re into, I’m always happy to give it a try and learn 💕

1qsm23k,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyWinterCar/comments/1qsm23k/2ks_guide_on_how_2_drive_the_taxi/,2k's guide on how 2 drive the taxi.,"Hi people of MWC. 

I've been hearing a lot of share complains about people struggling to drive the taxi and especially with keyboard players and it's caused by the silly 1st gear torque, underpowered engine the propensity of the car getting stuck on the snow.

As someone who sadly also experienced all this but eventually learned how to drive the taxi properly and have about 10+ hours experience on it. Let me share my way to drive the taxi properly and ESPECIALLY for keyboard players.

# PREQUISITES:

First of all, you need these two mods to aid your driving:

[Immersive taxi map](https://www.nexusmods.com/mywintercar/mods/653?tab=files) 

[Bright Night.](https://www.nexusmods.com/mywintercar/mods/518?tab=files)

2 sandbags.

Grab Anything (important later)

# DRIVING:

As I said before, the W124 in this game is known to be very underpowered, have absolutely no grip once it falls into the snow, have low ground clearance so the car is susceptible of getting stuck in snow and generally being a pain in the ass to drive. 

Make sure to LOOK FORWARD and keep monitoring W124's behaviour, I learned it the hard way when my car lost control and I got stuck in the snow just because I was adjusting the taxi meter.

# GEARING:

1st gear should ONLY be used if you want to climb a hill, stopping to pickup passengers, or at very low speed corners like tight intersections around dirt roads. When the car struggles to climb up the hill, do the zigzag method to have sufficient grip.

For 2nd gear, feather the throttle and do not try to punch it. Once the car has enough grip, then step on the accelerator and move to 3rd.

3rd and 4th is where the cars feels the most comfortable with and it should be the only gears that you'll need. This is where the car has the most grip because now you're in cruising speed and the gears are very long. 

# Speed and positioning:

[3rd gear @ 60KM\/H. Take note of the mirrors and the badge positioning.](https://preview.redd.it/h31iohxvhsgg1.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f5e0cf42629c3748bb128d140abd265332deafe)

As I said above, this car LOVES 3rd and 4th gear and wants to be taken gently. 

* For dirt roads, **60 to 80KM/H at 3rd or 4th gear** is the best for gripping power and general cornering entertainment. 
* For highway, **80 to 100KM/H at 4th gear** is the best, you have enough grip and better fuel economy.

Now this is the most important part of this writing, and that's the positioning of the car.

Note the positioning of the bonnet ornament, it's slightly off from the right-side dirt roads skid and it's intentional. 

Using the badge ornament, you can think of it as an iron sight but instead of shooting people, you are making sure that the car does not hit the snow bank or plow into a ditch. By positioning this bonnet ornament slightly off-center from the right-side dirt road skid, you are giving your self enough space for both the left-side of your car, and right-side of your car.

If you still do not feel comfortable with this, then using the mirrors to your advantage to see how far you are from the snow pit and ditch. Bright Night has been an absolute helper for night driving because of how cruel the vanilla darkness is, I recommend setting it at 0.18 to where it's still dark but much more tolerable.

# Braking: 

This is especially on dirt roads. If you feel a little bit too fast or that you are scared of losing grip, feather the brake and make sure that the bonnet ornament is very much still slightly off aligning from the skid. You can also use the ABS to its full advantage, in that it helps you stop more sufficiently but the light should only come on once or twice to give you the best braking through corners.

Driving fast on the highway? Slow your car down earlier and rely on the engine brake and THEN you step on the brake and let the ABS on once you enter the corner nice and gently.

# Unstucking:

The absolute most painful part about the taxi job. I lost all my earlier runs just because I drove too fast and I'm not giving the car enough space to move.

If you are in a flat road and are stuck in there (ig highway ditch or near PSK), then shift to 1st and keep pressing the accelerator.

If you get stuck on a snow bank, sadly the only way is to keep pushing it until it goes back to the road. If it's stuck in the ditch? Welp...ouch

**But.**

There is a very goofy way to do it, and it requires something called... ""Grab Anything"".

Yup, I also highly recommend having that so you can pick up the taxi like a diecast car and set in on the ground (lmao). 

Please use that if you lost all hope in ever trying to get the taxi out, even if all your loot drops to the ground...it's better than just losing all hope and cry that you wasted your time.

# Taxi Meter, customer rates and sanity:

Might be nice to add this here because there is a lot of confusion with the taxi meter and people wondering why they won't receive any customers.

Set the meter and 1 or 2 depending on the time of the day and just drive around for a bit, **DO NOT SET TO (-).**

Once you receive a call, immediately turn the red light **off.** 

 This red light should only be **on** if you are awaiting calls or dropping the passenger off.

Please make sure to take their luggage in and out...this can affect customer rates too. Also make sure to drop-off their luggage when they are still in the car and the red light has been turned on.

Immediately after payment, IMMEDIATELY TAKE THE RECEIPT AND CHUCK IT TF OUT OF THE WINDOW because if you forget it then the next customer would simply wont fucking get out, I sadly learned this the hard way and lost a huge amount of hours.

While waiting for the customer, go to Teimo's to buy a coffee or buy shit tons of energy drinks and eat jumbo burger meals to keep your fatigue down and erase your hunger and stress for the entire day. Pick up a mail order if you have time too.

# That's really all it, I do hope you can use this guide and improve your driving. Because once you do, it's incredibly satisfying to see the W124 eat through the corners lol.

1qslzk1,https://youtu.be/UoC2oIUS28o,4 Very Scary TRUE The Alaskan Bush Horror Stories,"# ""MULCHATNA"":

I set out from the small trading post near the mouth of the Nushagak River, my pack heavy with supplies for the long winter ahead. The boat ride up the winding waterways took days, and by the time I reached my old trapping grounds along the Mulchatna, I felt the quiet wrap around me like a thick blanket. This land was vast and empty, full of beaver dams and moose trails, but it always made me feel small. Little did I know that this trip would change everything.

My name is Elias, and I'd been coming to these parts for five seasons now. I built a small cabin last year, just a log shelter with a dirt floor and a stove made from an old barrel. It was hidden in a grove of spruce trees, far from any village. The furs I caught paid for my life back in town, and the solitude suited me fine. But that fall of 1925, whispers had started among the traders. They spoke of a man called Klutuk, a local who roamed these rivers like a shadow. He didn't like outsiders on what he saw as his land. Folks said he watched from the hills, silent and mean. I brushed it off as tall tales, the kind men tell around a fire to pass the time.

The first few weeks went smooth. I checked my traps each morning, skinning marten and fox with care. The air was crisp, and the leaves turned gold before falling. One day, I met old Henry at a bend in the river. He was a prospector, panning for gold in the shallow streams. His beard was gray and tangled, and his eyes darted around like he expected trouble.

""Elias,"" he said, squatting by my fire as I boiled coffee. ""You hear about the missing fellas up north?""

I nodded, pouring him a cup. ""Traders mentioned something. Said a couple trappers vanished last winter.""

Henry leaned in close, his voice low. ""It's more than that. I knew one of 'em, Bill from Anchorage. He set lines near the Kuskokwim fork. Never came back. His cabin was empty, traps untouched. But the door was busted in, like something strong had forced it.""

""Animals?"" I asked, though I knew bears didn't break doors that way.

He shook his head. ""No claw marks. And his rifle was gone. Folks say it's Klutuk. He's Yup'ik, lives off the land like his people always have. But he's gone bad, Elias. Thinks these rivers are his alone. He follows you, waits till you're alone, then... well, you don't come out.""

I laughed a bit, trying to shake the unease. ""Come on, Henry. Probably just got lost or froze. This country's hard on a man.""

He stared at me hard. ""You watch your back. If you see smoke where there shouldn't be, or hear footsteps that stop when you do, get out quick. He's out there, hunting people like we hunt beaver.""

Henry left the next morning, heading downstream. I watched his canoe disappear around the bend, feeling a knot in my gut. That night, as I lay in my bunk, the wind howled through the trees. I heard branches snap outside, but told myself it was a moose. Sleep came slow.

A few days later, things turned strange. I went to check a trap line along a creek, one I'd baited with fish heads. The traps were empty—not sprung, just gone. The chains had been cut clean, like with a knife. Nearby, the ground was scuffed, but no clear prints. I knelt down, running my fingers over the dirt. Something felt off, like eyes on me from the brush. I stood quick, rifle in hand, scanning the hills. Nothing moved. But the hairs on my neck stood up.

I hurried back to the cabin, barring the door tight. That evening, I cooked stew over the stove, trying to push the worry away. Outside, the dark pressed in. Then came a sound—a low whistle, like a man calling a dog. It echoed from the trees, faint but clear. I grabbed my lantern and stepped out, holding my gun.

""Who's there?"" I called, my voice steady but my hands shaking a little.

No answer. The whistle came again, closer this time. I swung the light around, seeing only shadows. ""Show yourself!""

Silence. I backed inside, bolting the door. My mind raced. Was it Henry playing a joke? No, he'd gone downriver. Or maybe wind through the branches. But deep down, I knew better.

The next morning, I decided to scout upstream, toward where Henry said Bill had trapped. The hike took hours, through thick alder and over rocky bars. I found the spot—a ruined cabin, walls caved in, roof gone. Inside, old pots scattered, a bedroll torn. No sign of Bill, but on the floor, dark stains that looked like old blood. My breath caught. I poked around, finding a journal half-buried in the dirt. Pages were ripped, but one entry read: ""Heard him last night. Footsteps circling. Must be that mad one they talk about. If I don't make it...""

I stuffed the journal in my pack, heart racing. As I turned to leave, I saw it—a fresh boot print in the mud outside, bigger than mine, heading into the woods. Not animal. Human.

I started back fast, the trail seeming longer in the fading light. Branches grabbed at my coat, and every rustle made me jump. Halfway home, I heard it again—that whistle, now behind me. I spun, rifle up. ""Leave me be!"" I shouted.

A figure moved in the trees, tall and dark, gone in a blink. Was it real? I ran, boots pounding the ground, breath coming in gasps. The cabin came into view, and I burst inside, slamming the door.

Night fell hard. I sat by the stove, gun across my lap, listening. Hours passed. Then, scratching at the wall, like nails on wood. Slow, deliberate. I froze, sweat beading on my forehead.

""Go away,"" I whispered.

The scratching stopped. Then a voice, rough and low, from outside. ""This land mine. You go.""

My blood went cold. It was him. Klutuk. I gripped the rifle tighter. ""I ain't bothering you. Just trapping.""

Laughter, cold and echoing. ""All bother. Like others. They gone now.""

I thought of Bill, of the stains in his cabin. ""What did you do to them?""

No answer. Footsteps circled the cabin, slow and heavy. I aimed at the door, finger on the trigger. The knob rattled. I fired once, the shot booming through the wood. Splinters flew, and a grunt outside. Footsteps retreated into the night.

I didn't sleep. At dawn, I packed what I could carry—furs, food, ammo—and left. The trail downriver felt endless, every shadow a threat. I glanced back often, expecting him to appear. But he didn't.

At the trading post, I told the marshal what happened. He listened, face grim. ""Klutuk,"" he said. ""We've heard. Killed many, they say. Trappers, prospectors. Hides in the hills, strikes quiet.""

""You going after him?"" I asked.

He nodded. ""Gathering men. Big search. But that country's huge. Might take years.""

They did search, for months, then years. Rumors spread—more missing men, bodies found with throats cut or shot from afar. Klutuk became a ghost story, but real. In 1931, the marshal found a cabin near the Mulchatna, burned out, bones inside. They said it was him, dead by his own fire maybe, or suicide. But no one knew for sure.

I never went back to those rivers. The fear stuck with me, that feeling of being hunted in the endless bush. Sometimes, in quiet nights, I still hear that whistle in my dreams, and wonder if he's really gone.





# ""THE BUSH PLANE"":

I worked as a dancer in a small club on the edge of Anchorage back in the early eighties. The place was always full of men who came in after long days at work, looking for company. Most were harmless, just lonely folks in a big, empty state like Alaska. One night, a quiet man with glasses walked up to me during my break. He looked ordinary, like someone who baked bread for a living, which I later found out he did.

""Hi,"" he said, his voice soft but steady. ""You seem nice. Want to make some easy money? Two hundred dollars for a quick job outside.""

I paused. Money was tight, and two hundred sounded good for not much effort. ""What kind of job?"" I asked, keeping my tone light.

""Just something private,"" he replied with a small smile. ""Nothing hard. Come with me to my car, and we can talk more.""

I thought about it for a second. He didn't seem pushy or mean. I grabbed my coat and followed him out to the parking lot. His car was a regular sedan, nothing fancy. I got in the passenger side, and he started driving. At first, it was quiet. Then he turned down a side road, away from the lights.

""Where are we going?"" I said, trying to sound casual.

""My place,"" he answered. ""It's close. Don't worry.""

Something felt off, but I pushed the thought away. We pulled up to a house in a quiet neighborhood. He led me inside, and the door clicked shut behind us. The living room was plain, with a couch and some hunting trophies on the walls – deer heads and rifles. He offered me a seat.

""Want a drink?"" he asked.

""No, thanks,"" I said. ""Let's just get to the point. What do you want for the money?""

He sat down across from me, then reached into his pocket. Instead of cash, he pulled out a big handgun. My whole body went cold. ""Don't scream,"" he said calmly, pointing it right at me. ""If you do what I say, everything will be fine.""

I nodded slowly, my mind racing. ""Okay,"" I whispered. ""What do you want me to do?""

""Stand up,"" he ordered. ""Take off your clothes.""

I did as he said, my fingers trembling on the buttons. He watched without a word. Then he grabbed my arm and pulled me toward the basement stairs. ""Down there,"" he said.

The basement was dim, with a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. There was a post in the middle of the room, like for support. He wrapped a chain around my neck and locked it to the post. It was tight enough that I couldn't pull away far. ""Sit,"" he told me.

I sat on the cold floor, trying not to cry. He went upstairs for a bit, then came back with food – a sandwich and water. ""Eat,"" he said, pushing it toward me.

""I'm not hungry,"" I replied, my voice small.

""Eat anyway,"" he insisted. ""You'll need your strength.""

He sat on the couch down there and watched me. After a while, he stood up and came closer. He hurt me then, in ways that made me want to disappear. It went on for hours. When he finished, he unchained me just enough to move a little, but kept the neck chain on. ""I'm going to sleep now,"" he said. ""You stay quiet.""

He lay down on the couch and closed his eyes. I waited, listening to his breathing get even. The chain rattled if I moved too much. I looked around the room – tools on a shelf, old boxes, nothing I could reach. My wrists hurt from where he'd tied them earlier. I thought about my family, wondering if they'd notice I was gone yet.

Hours passed. He woke up and looked at me. ""Time to go,"" he said.

""Go where?"" I asked, hope flickering for a moment.

""Somewhere special,"" he replied. ""You'll see.""

He unlocked the chain from the post but kept my hands cuffed in front. He pushed me up the stairs and out to his car. ""Get in the back,"" he ordered. ""Lie down.""

I climbed in, curling up on the seat. He drove for what felt like forever, the road getting bumpier. We stopped at a small airport – Merrill Field, I think. He had a plane there, a little bush plane for flying into the wild areas. ""Out,"" he said.

The air was crisp, but I focused on surviving. He opened the plane door and started loading supplies – a rifle, some bags. My mind screamed to run, but he was watching. Then he turned to adjust something in the cockpit.

This was my chance. I pushed the car door open quietly and slipped out. My feet hit the ground, and I ran. Behind me, I heard him shout, ""Stop!""

I didn't look back. My cuffs made it hard, but I waved my arms at a passing truck. The driver slammed on the brakes. ""Help!"" I yelled. ""Please help me!""

The man in the truck stared, his eyes wide. ""What's wrong?"" he asked.

""He's got a gun! He kidnapped me!"" I gasped, climbing into the cab.

""Okay, okay,"" the driver said, pulling away fast. ""I'll get you somewhere safe.""

He drove me to a motel nearby – the Mush Inn. I jumped out and ran inside. The clerk behind the desk looked shocked. ""Call the police,"" I begged. ""And call my boyfriend at the Big Timber Motel. Tell him I'm here.""

The clerk nodded and picked up the phone. ""Sit down, miss. Help is coming.""

I waited, shaking. When the police arrived, I told them everything – the man's face, his house, the plane. ""He was going to fly me out to the bush,"" I said. ""I think he was going to kill me there.""

The officers listened, but one seemed doubtful. ""We'll check it out,"" he said.

Later, I learned the man's name was Robert, the baker everyone knew in town. He told the police I was lying, that I wanted money from him. But I had left my shoes in his car as proof. And there were marks on my neck from the chain.

They didn't believe me at first. Robert had friends who said he was with them that night. I felt so alone, like no one cared. But then more bodies turned up in the wilderness – women like me, shot and left in the dirt along the Knik River. The police connected the dots. They searched his house and found jewelry from those women, a map with marks where bodies were buried.

One day, an investigator came to see me. ""You were right,"" he said. ""He's confessed to some of it. He took women out to the bush, let them run, and hunted them like deer.""

I shivered at the words. ""How many?"" I asked.

""At least seventeen,"" he replied. ""Maybe more. You got away. That makes you strong.""

I didn't feel strong. For weeks, I couldn't sleep without seeing his face, hearing his calm voice giving orders. The wilderness out there – the thick trees, the endless rivers – it all felt like a trap now. He used his plane to fly them far, where no one could hear screams.

They caught him because of me. In court, he admitted to the murders, but only some. He got over four hundred years in prison. No parole. He died old and sick behind bars.

But even now, I wonder about the ones they never found. The bush hides secrets. Women who ran, barefoot and scared, chased by a man with a rifle. I see it in my dreams – the chase, the shots echoing. I escaped, but part of me is still running.

The police found his attic full of guns and trophies – not just animal ones. Rings, necklaces from the dead. He kept them like souvenirs. One investigator told me, ""He said he let some go if they promised not to talk. But most, he hunted.""

""Why me?"" I asked.

""You fought back in your way,"" he said. ""You ran at the right moment.""

I nodded, but inside, the fear lingered. Anchorage felt smaller after that. I left the club, got a regular job. But every time I hear a plane overhead, I remember the airport, the door opening, my feet pounding the pavement.

Friends asked me about it later. ""What was he like?"" one said.

""Normal,"" I replied. ""That's the scary part. He baked donuts in the morning and killed at night.""

She hugged me. ""You're safe now.""

I smiled, but I knew the truth. The Alaskan bush is vast. People disappear, and sometimes, monsters hide in plain sight.

I think about the other women. One they called Eklutna Annie – found stabbed, half-buried. Another, a dancer like me, shot while running naked through the woods. He stripped them to make it harder, to feel the power.

In his confession, he described it coldly. ""I let her go,"" he said about one. ""Then I followed with the gun.""

The officer who told me that shook his head. ""He enjoyed the hunt.""

I try not to dwell, but the story sticks. It's why I tell it now – so others know to watch out. In a place like Alaska, the wild isn't just animals. Sometimes, it's people.

Years passed, and I built a life. But that night changed everything. The chain's weight, the gun's barrel, the plane's engine starting – sounds that echo. I got away, but the fear? It stays, quiet and waiting.





# ""THE LANDING"":

I worked as a mechanic in Manley Hot Springs, fixing boats and trucks for the folks who lived out here. It was a small place, maybe fifty people total, everyone knew each other by face if not by name. One afternoon, a stranger drove into town in an old car packed with gear. He looked rough, with a beard and eyes that didn't meet yours straight on. I was outside my shop when he stopped and asked for directions to the river.

""You heading out to camp?"" I asked, wiping oil from my hands.

He nodded. ""Yeah, looking for a quiet spot. Name's Michael.""

""I'm Dave,"" I said. ""The boat landing's down that way. Water's high this time of year, so watch yourself.""

He thanked me and drove off. Didn't think much of it—people came through sometimes, chasing gold or just the wild. But later that day, I heard shots echo from the landing. Sharp cracks, one after another. My gut told me it wasn't hunting. I grabbed my rifle from the shop and ran toward the sound.

When I got close, I saw bodies on the ground near the boats. Blood stained the dirt. Michael stood there, reloading his gun, calm as if he was target practicing. He had shot Fred, the guy who ran the supply post, and a couple others I recognized—neighbors, friends. My mind raced. Why? He hadn't said a word about trouble.

I ducked behind a tree before he spotted me. ""Hey!"" he yelled, like he knew someone was out there. ""Come on out!""

I stayed still, breath caught. He fired a shot into the woods, bark splintering near me. I bolted deeper into the trees, heart pounding hard. The bush closed in—thick brush, fallen logs, the Tanana River rushing nearby. I knew this land; I'd grown up here. But he moved like he belonged too, fast and sure.

I hid in a ditch, mud covering me, listening. Footsteps crunched leaves. ""I see you running,"" he called out. ""No point hiding. I'll find you.""

I waited, rifle ready, but I didn't want to shoot unless I had to. Minutes dragged. He passed close, muttering to himself. ""This place is mine now."" His voice was flat, no anger, just fact.

I crept away when he turned, heading upstream. The river was swollen from spring melt, cold and fast. I waded in up to my knees, using the noise to cover my steps. He fired again, bullet splashing water near me. ""Stop!"" he shouted.

I dove deeper, swimming across a shallow part, current pulling hard. On the other side, I ran into thicker woods, roots tripping me, branches scratching my face. My boots filled with water, slowing me. I found a hollow under a uprooted tree and crawled in, pulling leaves over me.

Night came slow. I heard more shots far off, then quiet. Was he gone? Or waiting? I stayed put, shivering, thinking of my wife back home. She must have heard the noise, maybe locked the door.

In the morning, I peeked out. No sign. I made my way back carefully, sticking to cover. The village was empty—folks hiding or worse. I found a radio in a cabin and called the troopers. ""There's a killer here,"" I whispered. ""Shot people at the landing. He's armed.""

They came quick, helicopters whirring overhead. I told them what I saw, pointed where he went. They tracked him up the Zitziana, a wild tributary full of bends and hiding spots.

Later, I heard the full story on the radio. They cornered him by his canoe. He shot at the chopper, killed a trooper. They fired back, ended it. Turned out he'd killed nine total, including one in Fairbanks before coming here. No one knew why—just a drifter with guns and bad thoughts.

I still fix boats, but I watch strangers closer now. The bush hides a lot, and sometimes what comes out changes everything.





# ""BLOOD ON THE AIRSTRIP"":

I remember the crunch of snow under my boots as I headed to the airstrip that morning. McCarthy was always quiet in winter, just a cluster of cabins tucked deep in the mountains, miles from anywhere. The weekly mail plane was due, and everyone looked forward to it—letters from family, supplies we couldn't get otherwise. I was carrying a thermos of hot tea for the wait, figuring it'd be cold standing out there.

Harley came out of his place first, waving at me. He was a sturdy guy, fixed engines for a living. ""Morning, Les,"" he called. ""Plane's early today. Hear that buzz?""

I nodded, listening to the faint drone in the sky. ""Yeah. Hope it brings good news.""

We reached the strip, a flat stretch of packed snow ringed by tall pines. A few others were already there—Donna with her scarf tight around her neck, Chris checking his watch, and Tim stacking some crates. ""Any word from town?"" Donna asked the group.

Chris shook his head. ""Not since last week. But I ordered parts for the generator.""

That's when the first shot rang out, sharp and close. Everyone froze. Tim spun around. ""What was that?""

Before anyone could answer, another crack, and Tim jerked back, red blooming on his coat. He fell without a sound. Donna screamed, and we scattered. I dove behind a snowbank, heart pounding hard. More shots came, one after another, like someone was picking us off.

I peeked over the edge. A man was walking calm from the trees—Louis, the computer guy who'd moved here a year back. He had a rifle, the kind for hunting deer, but he aimed it at people. He shot Chris next, right in the chest. Donna ran for her cabin, but he fired again, and she dropped in the snow.

""Harley!"" I whispered loud. He was crouched near me, face pale. ""We gotta run.""

He nodded, and we bolted for the woods. Branches snagged my jacket as we crashed through. Behind us, more shots echoed. I heard a yell—someone else hit, maybe Max or Lena, who'd been coming late.

We made it to a thick stand of trees. Harley leaned against one, breathing heavy. ""Why's he doing this?""

""I don't know,"" I said. ""He always seemed quiet. Fixed my radio once.""

A branch snapped nearby. We went still. Footsteps crunched slow in the snow. Louis's voice called out, even and cold. ""Come on out. It's no use hiding.""

My mouth went dry. Harley signaled to move deeper. We crept away, keeping low. The woods were dense here, full of fallen logs and brush. I slipped once, landing hard, but bit my lip to stay quiet.

He got closer. ""I see tracks,"" he said, almost to himself. A shot blasted bark off a tree above us. Harley gasped—shrapnel hit his arm, blood seeping through his sleeve.

""Run!"" he hissed at me. But Louis was there, stepping out like a shadow. He raised the rifle. Harley lunged at him, but the gun fired, and Harley slumped down.

I turned and sprinted, zigzagging through the pines. Bullets whizzed past, one grazing my leg, burning like fire. I fell into a ditch, rolled under some roots. Pain shot up my thigh, but I clamped a hand over my mouth.

Louis walked by, boots inches from my face. ""You're hurt,"" he said softly. ""It'll be quick if you show yourself.""

I held my breath, eyes squeezed shut. He poked at bushes with the rifle barrel, then moved on. Minutes stretched like hours. The cold seeped in, but I didn't dare move.

Finally, his steps faded. I waited longer, listening to distant shots—more people? The town had only twenty-two of us in winter. How many left?

When quiet settled, I crawled out, leg throbbing. Blood trailed behind me. I tore my shirt for a bandage, tied it tight. The airstrip was maybe a mile back, but Louis might be there. Instead, I headed for the old mine road, hoping to flag someone.

The woods felt endless, trees closing in. Every rustle made me jump—a squirrel, or him? My mind raced: Why Louis? He'd talked about the pipeline once, how it ruined the land. Said it brought too many people, changed everything. But this?

I heard the plane land, engines whining down. Then voices—shouts, confusion. The pilot must've seen the bodies. More shots cracked. I pushed faster, ignoring the pain.

Dusk came early in March. Shadows grew long in the trees. I found a creek, followed it upstream to hide my trail. Water soaked my boots, numbing my feet.

Night fell, stars sharp overhead. I huddled in a hollow under a log, shivering. Sounds echoed—weird cries from animals, wind moaning. But no more gunshots. Maybe he was done.

At dawn, I moved again. My leg swelled bad, but I limped on. Reached the edge of town by noon. Smoke rose from a cabin—whose? I snuck closer, peering through windows. Empty rooms, blood on floors. My stomach twisted.

Then engines roared—a helicopter. State troopers, landing at the strip. I stumbled out, waving. ""Help!"" I yelled, voice hoarse.

Two officers ran over, guns drawn. ""What happened here?""

""Louis,"" I gasped. ""He shot everyone. Harley, Donna, all of them.""

They got me to the chopper, bandaged my leg. ""Where is he?"" one asked.

""I don't know. In the woods, maybe.""

They searched. Found Louis at his place, calm like nothing happened. He didn't fight when they cuffed him.

Later, in the hospital, I learned he killed six that day—Harley, Tim, Donna, Chris, Max, Lena. Wounded me and another who hid better. Said he planned to kill us all, then blow up the pipeline. Thought it was destroying Alaska. He'd been plotting for months, even made a silencer for another gun.

Troopers found his notes, maps of the pipeline. He got sentenced to hundreds of years, locked away forever.

McCarthy's empty now in winter, just ghosts in the snow. I left for Anchorage, but the woods call sometimes. I wake up hearing those shots, his voice in the trees. The bush hides things—secrets, pain. And once it grabs you, it doesn't let go.",1,1769912955.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
