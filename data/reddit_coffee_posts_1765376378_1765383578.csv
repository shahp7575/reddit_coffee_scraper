1pj6oky,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pj6oky,Delulu is the only solulu for OP! Out,"I sat in the corner of the cafe, holding a mug of caffe mocha, waiting. The place was warm and quiet, filled with the soft hum of conversation and the smell of fresh coffee. I wasn’t sure why I felt so nervous, but there was a flutter in my stomach as I waited for her, t***he girl in the black dress***. Any moment now, I thought, glancing at the door again. I took a sip of my coffee, trying to calm my nerves.

Then, she walked in.

Her dress was simple but perfect. She looked around the room, and when our eyes met, she smiled. Something about that smile made my heart skip. ***""Are you the one I'm meeting?""*** she asked softly. I stood up, a little surprised at how easily the words came out. ""***Yeah, that's me. I ordered a caffe mocha.***""

We sat down and started talking. At first, it was just small talk about the weather and the coffee, but soon the conversation flowed easily. She had a way of making everything feel natural, like we had known each other for a long time. The more we talked, the more I felt like I was floating. There was something about her that made everything else fade away, like my worries didn’t exist anymore.

Then, as we were talking, she reached out her hand, like she wanted to shake hands or maybe something more. Just as I was about to take it, the waiter’s voice broke the moment. ***“Excuse me, your order is ready.”*** I blinked, confused. The girl in the black dress was gone. The table was empty, and the cafe was just as it was before. I looked around, but she wasn’t there.

don’t lose paper receipts, and I can easily track my spending and expenses?”


One user recommended an app called [Receipt Scanner Track Expense](https://secure-acs2ui-b4-indmum-munmdc.wibmo.com/v1/acs/services/browser/creq/L/8198/aa4b0468-c23a-11f0-8a8f-7336fe43c7ad), and I thought:
“Hmm, too good to be true — but I gave it a try.”


Turns out… it **really works**.
I snapped a picture of a crumpled grocery receipt. The app detected the total amount, date,
vendor name — all automatically. I didn’t have to input anything manually. Boom — the
receipt was saved forever, safe in the cloud, no more shoebox full of paper.


Since then, every purchase — groceries, work‑related expenses, even a random coffee —
goes through the app. It organizes them by category (food, tools, bills, etc.), and after a few
weeks it started giving me cool analytics — charts showing where my money goes, how
much I spend per month, and which categories are bleeding funds.


Now I have a neat little dashboard of my spending habits for this year. I use it for my
freelance projects to track business expenses vs personal ones. It’s a game‑changer —
saves time, stress, and helps me see exactly where my money is going.

highly recommend trying [Receipt Scanner Track Expense](https://secure-acs2ui-b4-indmum-munmdc.wibmo.com/v1/acs/services/browser/creq/L/8198/aa4b0468-c23a-11f0-8a8f-7336fe43c7ad).",1,1765383340.0,LibraryScience,0,1.0,False

Very early in the conversion process -- I know I want to become Jewish and convert and have enjoyed talking to this rabbi of a temple that is close to me and I enjoy their services.

 However, this rabbi said I need to become a paying member before we move forward, and I think the timing of her bringing it up really rubbed me the wrong way (we've only met once for coffee), so I would like to know what is ""normal"" for this kind of thing. It's a significant amount of money, which would be hard to swing for me right now. She did say they could be flexible, but said that a little bit as an afterthought. She also said I would have to talk to a committee about financial flexibility, which feels icky and vulnerable. 

I really love this shul, but I haven't explored other synagogues in the area yet at all, so committing $1500+ to this one just so I could start my conversion feels like too much too soon. I'm not opposed to one day becoming a paying member, but I haven't met many people beyond the rabbi and don't know if this is my home yet. But I also don't want to postpone my conversion process because I'm nervous to put my money down on one shul.

1pj6m4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Women/comments/1pj6m4y/questions_about_divorce_costs_in_colorado_seeking/,Questions about divorce costs in Colorado. Seeking advice on keeping it affordable.,"I'm based in Colorado Springs and just beginning the divorce proceedings after a rocky 11-year marriage to my husband, and I'm trying to get a handle on what this is all going to cost without it spiraling out of control. We tied the knot back in 2014 in a simple courthouse ceremony in Pueblo, both of us in our late 20s and excited about starting a life together—he was working as a mechanic at a local auto shop, and I had a job as a teacher at an elementary school nearby. Things were good at first; we rented a small apartment in the Springs, saved up for a down payment on a modest two-bedroom house in Fountain with a monthly mortgage of about $1,900, and even adopted a rescue dog named Max who became like our first kid. But over time, the cracks started showing—little arguments turned into big ones, like when he'd forget to pick up groceries after work, leaving me to scramble for dinner with whatever was in the pantry, such as canned soup and crackers, or when I'd get frustrated about him leaving oily tools scattered in the garage, making it hard to park my car without tripping over wrenches.

The bigger issues built up around money and our lifestyles drifting apart. He got a promotion a few years ago that had him working longer hours, pulling in about $55,000 a year, while my salary as a teacher hovered around $48,000, and we started clashing over bills—like who'd pay the $150 monthly utility or the $300 car insurance premium. We'd have these tense evenings sitting at the kitchen table, going over bank statements on my laptop, arguing about why there was an extra $50 charge for his lunch runs to fast food places. Then came the parenting disagreements after our son was born five years ago; he's now in kindergarten at the school where I teach, and we'd fight about discipline, like whether it was okay for him to watch cartoons on the tablet before bed or if I was too strict about bedtime routines, reading him stories from his favorite dinosaur books until he fell asleep. There was a particularly bad incident last winter when we planned a family ski trip to Breckenridge—I'd packed the car with snacks like granola bars and thermoses of hot chocolate, plus our son's little skis—but we ended up bickering the whole drive about navigation because the GPS rerouted us due to snow, and we turned back home frustrated, with our son upset in the back seat asking why we couldn't go play in the snow.

Emotional distance grew too; I noticed he was spending more time at the bar with coworkers after shifts, coming home smelling like beer and barely talking, while I'd be left handling the household alone, folding laundry in the living room late at night or prepping lesson plans for my class. I confronted him about some flirty messages I saw on his phone from a woman at work, nothing proven but enough to shatter trust, and we attempted marriage counseling three times at a clinic in downtown Colorado Springs, in a plain room with motivational posters on the walls, but it felt pointless—he'd promise to communicate better, but then we'd revert to silence during meals, eating simple things like grilled cheese sandwiches without much conversation. Eventually, we agreed to separate; he's moved into a rental apartment about 10 miles away in Security-Widefield, and we're sharing custody of our son on a week-on, week-off basis, but it's logistically tough, like coordinating who takes him to soccer practice on Wednesdays at the community field or handles his dentist appointments for check-ups every six months.

Asset-wise, it's getting complicated under Colorado's equitable distribution rules—we have the house with roughly $120,000 in equity built up, a joint savings account down to about $6,500 after recent withdrawals for repairs like fixing the leaky roof that cost $2,000, his truck with a remaining loan of $8,000, my sedan that's paid off but needs new tires soon at around $400, and smaller items like the living room set we bought on sale—a comfy blue couch and matching chairs that the dog loves to nap on—plus kitchen stuff such as our blender for making smoothies and the coffee pot I use every morning for my black coffee ritual. We're also splitting retirement accounts; he has a 401(k) worth about $35,000 from his job, and I have a pension starting to accrue through the school district.

To prepare, I dove into researching divorce costs in Colorado online, hoping to avoid the financial pitfalls I've read about. From what I found, the average here is around $11,500, which is a bit lower than the national average of $15,000, probably due to differences in living costs across states. But it can vary wildly depending on how contentious things get—I've seen examples of people paying $10,000 just for an initial retainer, then racking up bills over $200,000 in drawn-out battles with aggressive lawyers who bill by the hour and drag things out. On the flip side, super cheap options like a $500 do-it-yourself divorce can backfire, leading to mistakes that cost tens of thousands to fix later. Factors like the number of disputes, how heated the arguments are, and whether you go the litigation route (which amps up the conflict and hours billed) versus something more collaborative really impact the total. One approach that caught my eye avoids the traditional billable hour mess, which apparently incentivizes prolonging cases; instead, it starts with a low opening fee (way less than those big retainers) and then a fixed monthly rate based on the service level you pick, and that rate stays the same no matter how long it takes, stopping once the divorce is final. They even offer add-ons like coaching or parenting coordination at flat fees, and you can keep using resources afterward for life changes without surprise costs. It sounds predictable and less stressful, especially since our case might involve some disputes over the house and custody details, like who gets primary parenting time during school holidays or how we handle extracurricular costs for our son's activities, which run about $100 a month.

Has anyone in Colorado gone through this and can break down what you actually ended up paying, maybe with tips on mediation versus court to keep expenses down? What red flags should I look for in lawyer agreements to prevent hidden fees, and is it worth exploring fixed-rate options over hourly billing? Any advice on handling the paperwork for things like child support calculations, based on our incomes and the standard guidelines here?",1,1765383188.0,Divorce_Women,1,1.0,False

I had a conference in Singapore with three connecting flights. Chicago to Los Angeles. Los Angeles to Tokyo. Tokyo to Singapore. Twenty-three hours of total travel time. And naturally everything that could go wrong did.

My first flight got delayed. Which made me miss my connection. Which meant scrambling to get rebooked. Which meant my checked bag ended up somewhere in the Pacific while I ended up at a hotel near LAX at midnight with nothing but my cabin luggage.

Thank God for that cabin luggage. I'd packed it smart. Change of clothes. Toiletries. Phone chargers. My laptop and all my conference materials. Medication. Even a small towel because you never know. While everyone else at the airline counter was panicking about their checked bags I just shrugged and went to find coffee.

The next morning I made my rebooked flight. I arrived in Singapore twelve hours later than planned but with everything I actually needed. My presentation went fine. My clients never knew the chaos. And I learned that packing light isn't about having less. It's about having exactly what matters.

That bag came with me on every trip after that. It forced me to think about what I really needed versus what I thought I might need. Turns out you need a lot less than you think.

The latest UI update is a massive step backward.

One of Zepto’s biggest advantages was its exciting, feature-rich but intuitive interface. Categories like Fresh, Sales, Cafe and Price Drops made browsing genuinely fun and effortless. That edge is now gone.

What really set Zepto apart was that it showed product prices directly on the front pages. You didn’t have to tap into multiple screens just to see prices. That convenience alone is why I preferred it over Blinkit and Instamart.

Now the UI feels too fckin generic, pricing visibility is worse, and there’s no proper filtering either. Instead of doubling down on what made them different, they’ve regressed into a more frustrating shopping experience.

It sounds funny now, because looking back, the signs were there from day one — I just never allowed myself to see them clearly.

We went to the same school, same coaching, same circle. Life kept us in the same orbit without ever really pushing us closer. After school ended, and lockdowns came and went, we stayed connected online. She was the only girl I had ever asked for her number, and she gave it with a sarcastic “don’t give it to anyone else” kind of warning. That one little moment stayed with me longer than I expected.

Slowly, without noticing, I started saving her photos, her voice notes, random screenshots… not because I was obsessed, but because those moments meant something to me. I didn’t realise what that meant back then.

Birthdays became our unofficial tradition. I always wished her at midnight, every single year. Once I was a day late, so I compensated by wishing a day earlier the next year. I even memorised her real name — something she’d never told me before — because it was written on her birthday cake in a photo she posted.

During vacations I always met her on the very last day before I had to leave again. It became a ritual for both of us. We’d meet at this small old shop everyone from school used to visit. She didn’t know the owner was my close friend, so when she found out, she teased me for acting like the place might be closed.

I noticed little things — how she’d hand me her scarf or phone without asking, how I’d automatically carry her things so her hands stayed free. When someone spoke rudely to her once, I wanted to react but didn’t, because she didn’t need chaos — she needed calm. Afterward she told me she felt bad about it, and I reassured her she shouldn’t take the words of people like that seriously. Moments like that kept happening. They felt small to the world but huge to me.

We kept in touch through everything — exams, internships, failures, disappointments, random check-ins. She’d ask how my work was going, I’d ask about her preparation. She’d tease me about office life; I’d tease her about being too serious.

One winter she had a fall and got a fracture. I checked on her every day. I don’t know why it hurt me so much that she was hurt, but it did. That was the first time I complimented her directly. Even that felt scary, like I was accidentally revealing too much.

Her birthdays started becoming emotional markers for me. I always wished at midnight. One year, her close friends forgot to wish her until she posted a status. She was upset, so I called — though honestly, I just wanted to hear her voice. She asked me why I called, and I said, “to wish you Happy Valentine’s Day.” She laughed. Another tradition was born.

Life got busy — internships, work, exams — but we always found time to check on each other. She’d ask for my photos just to make stickers out of them. I’d travel home for a weekend hoping to meet her, but sometimes her schedules didn’t allow it. I didn’t mind. Somehow, just knowing she wanted to talk made things easier.

Placement season hit me hard. I was shortlisted everywhere, rejected everywhere. It was one of the darkest phases of my life. She was going through her own struggles too. That’s when I finally opened up about something painful from my past — something that changed how I looked at relationships. I had never shared it with her before. I didn’t tell her because I wanted to confess anything. I just wanted to be honest before life got more complicated.

That conversation changed something between us. She saw a side of me I never show anyone. And I saw how deeply she cared.

Eventually I got an offer. She cleared her own important exams too. We both felt relieved. She was genuinely happy for me, and I was proud of her in a way that’s hard to explain.

When we were both finally settled, I realised I couldn’t keep pretending anymore. I liked her. Not a crush, not an infatuation. Something real. Something slow-burning, built over years of tiny moments.

I wanted to tell her in person — it felt wrong to say something so important over the phone. But the day I arrived home, things didn’t go according to plan. A friend had an accident and I had to move my flight earlier. She wasn’t supposed to know I was coming, but now she did.

We met the day after I arrived. Went to a café. Laughed at stupid jokes. Talked about future plans. She looked genuinely happy, and every time I tried to say something, I stopped myself because I didn’t want to ruin that moment. I just wanted to sit there and soak it in — her smile, her voice, the ease of being around her.

A day before I had to fly back, I asked her if we could meet for just five minutes. I was nervous. She said no at first — festival, family, timing — and I understood. I had already packed my bags prepared to leave without saying anything.

But then she called back and we met at a quiet place that will probably remain one of the most important locations in my life. 

And now, when I think of the entire journey — from school benches and awkward silences, accidental interactions, shared jokes, late-night check-ins, comforting words, misunderstandings, festivals, coffees, and tiny acts of care — I’m amazed by how quietly life turns someone into someone you can’t imagine not having in your life.

Until 7 days into the role, the hiring manager asks me to join a call, thought I was going to discuss my future plans and made a presentation about how I would be succeeding in my role.

Instead I saw that the HR was on the call as well, and within 10 seconds of me joining they told me they are releasing me from the company effective immediately, didn't state any reason. I asked multiple times what I did, or is there anything I could have done to avoid it. They said they don't have any answer for me, and they just don't think it's a good fit.

Imagine leaving a secure job where I was able to pay my rent and bills on time, barely able to survive as an immigrant (moved here less than a year ago), to being excited to join a new one with a hustle and fast paced culture (which I like and thrive in)...only to be let go before the holidays, a time when others are celebrating and ideally I should have been too.

In the time I was there, I was constantly learning, getting upto speed with product knowledge, doing chats with people constantly, even spent time on the weekend so l could learn faster. I dare say most people liked me in that short time and I thought I would do well.

My guess: I was overly social. I was constantly reacting to messages and responding with a tinge of my personality...quirky and humorous often. They probably expected me to put my head down and just work like a robot. That's not what they made me feel like when I interviewed. It's a two way thing, and if they thought I wasn't a good fit, why even bother extending me an offer or make me feel like dreaming about my future.

I feel much better than I expected but obviously I'm still processing. I am in debt and not sure how to pay my rent and bills next month...but I am obviously trying to stay strong. I got back into the game, booked a coffee chat today and 2 shortlists for assessments...but I have such a sour taste in my mouth and I don't know how to handle this.

If I had done something wrong, or made a mistake, l would be dying of guilt. I was just told to go. I thought they were humans too. Misled in the interview rounds.
The whole demeanour changed.

Please help me understand what could have gone wrong or what can I do to avoid this the next time.
I appreciate you all and I'm happy to offer my advice on how to do the searches and interviews better. Thank you!",0,1765382910.0,recruitinghell,2,0.33,False

He said we'd use it twice and then it would collect dust in the garage like everything else. But I had this vision of us riding through the neighborhood together on Sunday mornings like some kind of vintage postcard couple.

Turns out we both were wrong. We did use it way more than twice. But the real surprise was everyone else. The first time we rode past the Henderson family they stopped and stared. The next weekend they had their own. Then the Chens got one. Before we knew it there were six couples in our neighborhood all riding these tandem bikes on weekend mornings.

It became this unofficial club. We'd all meet at the park entrance at eight and ride the loop trail together. People started bringing coffee in travel mugs. Someone made matching t-shirts as a joke but then we all actually wore them. The teenagers thought we were embarrassing but you could tell they secretly loved it.

What started as my silly romantic idea turned into this whole community thing. We knew each other's names now. We helped when someone's kid was selling fundraiser chocolate. We actually talked instead of just waving from driveways. I'd found the bicycle months ago while looking at random stuff on Alibaba and honestly never imagined it would connect us all like this.",2,1765382791.0,citybike,0,1.0,False

1pj6eoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicJobSearch/comments/1pj6eoe/why_cold_emailing_academic_departments_works_to/,Why cold emailing academic departments works to find a job.,"I coached 7 candidates this week that made me realize most people assume academic hiring is entirely formal job postings and committee processes. So they will apply, wait, and hope.

I liek to coach people with a different strategy, to actively pursue a new role daily by cold emailing and reaching out to people. Here's why:

A huge amount of hiring, especially for adjunct and lecturer positions happens informally. And cold outreach can actually work.

**This is a real story I am experiencing right now in my Professor role.**

Right now, I have a data analytics course that needs an instructor. I haven't posted it anywhere. I haven't even reached out to my professional network yet because honestly, I haven't had time to sit down and think ""okay, who do I know who could teach this, what are the skills and job requirements I would need to have, etc.""

If someone emailed me today and said ""Hey, I teach data analytics at the university level, do you have any needs in that area?"" they'd be making my life significantly easier.

This happens constantly. Departments have teaching needs before they have job postings. Someone knows they need a course covered next semester, but the formal process hasn't kicked in yet. Or they're relying on word-of-mouth but haven't gotten around to asking around.

**Even if you're not looking for a job or they aren't hiring.**

Cold outreach catches people in that window between ""we have a need"" and ""we've formalized the search."" You're not competing against 200 applicants, you're the only person in their inbox solving a problem they have.

Even when there's no immediate need, you're planting a seed. I've pointed people toward opportunities at other institutions simply because they reached out. Someone emailed me about accounting positions, I didn't have anything, but I knew colleagues at a nearby university who were actively searching. That connection wouldn't have happened through a job board.

**How to actually do this**

A few things I've seen work:

First, volume matters. Send 100 messages. Not 10, not 20—100. Then you'll actually have data. Maybe 80% don't respond. Maybe 5% say ""not this year, but check back."" Maybe 2% have something. That's actionable information.

Second, keep it short (you can get templates from ProfessorTown.com). ""I'm a \[field\] instructor with experience in \[specific courses\]. I'm exploring opportunities in the \[region\] area—I'd be grateful to know if your department has any upcoming teaching needs, or if you could point me in a helpful direction.""

Third, consider two approaches: the direct pitch (""here's my background, here's what I can teach"") or the warmer approach (""I'd love to learn more about your work, could I buy you a coffee?""). Both can work. The warm approach takes more time but builds relationships, this also helps you develop a larger professional network that will pay dividends wherever you do land.

**It will feel awkward the first 100 times you do this. You should think about it like a long term skill you're owrking on, not a one off.**

Most people won't do this because it feels awkward. We're trained to wait for posted positions and follow formal processes. Cold outreach feels pushy or presumptuous.

But from the other side of the table, it often feels like a gift. Someone qualified showing up exactly when you need them? Thank god.

The worst case is silence. The best case is you skip the application pile entirely.",1,1765382716.0,AcademicJobSearch,0,1.0,False
1pj6ehi,https://i.redd.it/ao6gs8o0he6g1.jpeg,Chianti&Korn POV story (from MeitanteiConan),"**FIRST ACT – NOISE   I.The Exact Hour**

*\[Interior – Small apartment, Tokyo – Dawn\]*

**06:00am**

Korn opens his eyes.  
Not because any alarm rings, but because that’s simply how his body works.

He had spent years waking up at the exact same time, without a second of deviation.

A moment later, the familiar beep of his old plastic Casio watch sounded.  
He didn’t turn it off.  
He let it beep. As always.

For a few seconds he remained still, listening to the silence.  
Then he sat on the bed and placed his feet on the floor: left first, then right.  
As always.

**06:04am**

Korn begins his routine: fifty push-ups, fifty sit-ups, fifty squats.  
The same repetitions. Every single day.  
The body reacts automatically; the mind, not so much.

**06:22am**

Korn looks at himself in the bathroom mirror.  
He shaves with an old but sharp blade.  
Every stroke is symmetrical, deliberate, silent.  
Always in the same order: cheek, chin, neck.  
Never the other way around.  
He tried it once. And he bled.  
He likes the feel of metal on skin. The cold water. The smell of soap.

**06:40am**

Korn takes a shower.

The water falls over his body, warm, unrushed.  
Afterward, he dries himself with a towel, also unrushed. He knows he has plenty of time as long as he sticks to the schedule.  
The mirror fogs up. He wipes it with an open palm.  
For a moment, his reflection becomes clear. The exact moment he needs to apply the aftershave he already set out.  
Then the steam covers him again.  
He prefers it that way.  
He returns to his room and gets dressed.

In black. Always in black.

**06:55am**

Coffee. Cheap coffee. Bad coffee. The kind he likes. Or he is used to.

Strong. No sugar, no milk, no other flavours. Just bitterness.

He reads the newspaper, always on paper.  
The ritual isn’t about the news, but about the cadence of the pages, the sound they make when they fold, the smell of ink.  
Sometimes he underlines words or sentences for no reason at all, just to feel he’s still interpreting the world.

**07:12am**

He goes back to the bathroom, opens the cabinet above the sink, and there it is: his first-aid medical kit.

He checks the bandages, the alcohol, the gauze. Makes sure nothing is expired, or damaged. Or out of place.  
Not because he expects to use it today, but because he never knows when he might need it.

The Casio watch blinks on his wrist.

**07:30am**

He steps out onto the balcony.  
Looks at the city.  
Watches the smoke from the chimneys rise slowly.

It’s cold outside. January.  
New year, new life. Or so they say. He doesn’t buy it.  
He only believes in routine. Routine as Anesthesia.  
He thinks it, without saying it, just as he does every day:  
“Everything still stands.”

**07:45am**

He closes the apartment door.  
The hallway smells of bleach and damp.  
He walks down the three flights of stairs to the lobby and steps outside.

The street is already boiling with noise: trains rattling in the distance, the hum of electric cables, the first neon signs flickering awake on office buildings.  
And people —everywhere— filling sidewalks and crossings.

Korn walks with his hands in his pockets and dark glasses on.  
Sometimes, if he pays attention, he notices people stepping aside before meeting his gaze.  
He isn’t sure if it’s respect or instinct.  
He only knows he’d probably do the same.

His car waits for him across the street: an old diesel Jeep, the kind you hardly see in the city anymore; too big for everyday life.  
The body carries dents from older years.  
The paint, a dull dark grey, is peeling at the edges.  
Inside, is smells as oil, tobacco, and worn leather.

And yet the engine always starts on the first try.  
Korn never thought about replacing it.  
He doesn’t like change.  
As long as it works, he’ll keep it.  
And, in some way, the car seems to know:

It isn’t pretty, but it’s loyal.  
Noisy, but steady.  
Like him —an old mechanism that keeps doing its job without asking for anything in return.  
Only to stay in shape and be ready for whatever comes.

Like his body.  
Like his first aid kit.  
Like Korn.

He stubs out his cigarette, climbs into the driver’s seat, shuts the door, fastens the belt, and turns the key.  
The deep rumble of the diesel engine fills the air like an old animal waking from hibernation.

He shifts into gear and joins the traffic.

**08:20am**

He reaches the industrial district on the outskirts of Tokyo.  
A maze of rusted warehouses, parked trucks, and lots that were half-abandoned, half-for-sale, surrounds him.

In one of those warehouses —no sign, no windows, no neon arrows pointing anywhere — lies the secondary base.  
One of the Organization’s many secondary bases.

Korn had been working with them for years.  
Or for them.  
Over time, the difference had stopped mattering.

Orders arrived by regular mail.  
Payments came in cash.  
No signatures. No names.

Still, he liked to drop by every now and then.  
It was always good to remind them he existed.  
To let them know he was still around.

Even if his work was almost always in the rear, and not on the front line.

**08:30am**

He adjusted his glasses.  
Stepped into the warehouse.  
The door creaked before closing behind him.

Inside, the air was cold and dusty.

The industrial space was cluttered with useless junk covered in tarps, rusted crates, a lathe that had been dead for years.  
No one walking in would imagine what lay beneath their feet.  
That was the point.

Korn walked toward one side, slipping between two crooked shelves.  
He glanced both ways, though he already knew no one was there.  
He opened the floor hatch and descended the metal stairs.

His footsteps echoed through the underground tunnel — a long, silent cylinder of concrete.  
At the end, a perfectly ordinary elevator waited, with no unnecessary buttons.  
Just one.

Korn pressed **–8**.

The elevator began its descent with a soft hum.  
For a few seconds, he felt the vibration running through his bones.  
He checked his watch.

**08:38.**

**Right on time.**

He might have smiled, if he remembered how. But he didn’t even try.

When the doors opened, it wasn’t onto a narrow corridor, but onto a long, white, polished hallway lit by recessed LED strips.

Korn walked forward, unhurried.  
He didn’t like rushing.  
Experience had taught him that rushing is what gets people killed.

At the corner, the hallway opened into a massive underground garage — as big as a department-store parking lot.

Rows of vehicles — SUVs, vans, motorcycles, even sports cars — waited patiently to be chosen.

A mechanic, lying under a chassis, cursed something under his breath while a coworker handed him a tool.  
A group of three employees crossed the space carrying labeled crates; another group climbed into a van, sliding the door shut with a metallic thud before driving off.  
In one corner, a woman with a ponytail picked up cigarette butts and mopped the floor while humming to herself.

Everyone wore black.  
No one looked up.  
No one made more noise than necessary.

No one would guess all of this existed beneath an abandoned warehouse.

Korn crossed the garage with steady steps, greeting no one.  
Discrete cameras tracked his movement; he didn’t need to look at them to know.

At the far end, an automatic door slid open without a sound.

The next room resembled a minimalist corporate reception area: metal counter, inactive screens, a table with three chairs that no one ever used.  
A faint smell of coffee and air freshener lingered in the air.

There, leaning against the counter, a woman waited for him with a folder in hand.

—You’re on time — she said.

Korn didn’t reply.  
Punctuality wasn’t a virtue; it was simply his nature.

She opened the folder.

—New orders — she announced.

A pause.

—A new assignment.

The Casio on his wrist flickered.  
Korn lifted his gaze.

He was ready.

now i’m sharing a house with his wife. yep.

we met on hinge. he had the “divorced no kids looking for something serious” routine. first date was cute. tiny bar. pool table. he “taught” me to shoot even though i was already decent and i just let him because whatever. hand on my waist. walked me home. good morning texts. cat pics. graduation. he even cried when i got my first job. i was annoying in the group chat like omg he’s actually emotionally available???

there were only two yellow flags i was dumb enough to just… step right over:

1. i never saw his place. always an excuse. too far. messy. weird landlord. a whole lot of nothing.


2. he hated photos. “my ex is nuts” blah blah.



i was just vibing in my idiot bubble until the universe drop-kicked me.

this new girl started at my job. we got drinks. followed each other on ig. im half asleep that night scrolling her feed and i see a wedding pic and i literally stop because the groom looks exactly like my boyfriend and i’m like haha no way. then i zoom in. then i swipe. then i see the tattoo. and the watch i gave him. and then the captions. “my forever.” “best dad ever.” BABIES. as in plural. baby girl in a pink hat. posted the same weekend he said he was on a boys trip.

my blood went cold. like tunnel vision cold.

his wife is emily. 29. rn. two kids under three. her ig is a scrapbook of a whole life he never mentioned. meanwhile i’m over here thrilled he remembered my coffee order while he’s doing family photoshoots in matching flannels.

i checked hinge. he was talking to me before their second baby was born. i sat on my bathroom floor like an absolute ghost.

and then i thought if i didn’t know any of this then she probably didn’t either.

i dm’d her from a burner like “this is insane but i think we’re dating the same man.” i sent a selfie of me and him and a hinge screenshot. i basically hurled my phone away after.

she replied in under a minute. sent her number. told me to call “right now.” no hello just “how long?” i said 2.5 years. she broke. like i could hear her whole world fold in half.

we compared timelines for hours. he had two scripts he copied and pasted. same restaurants. same hotels. same lines. she said “i feel like my whole life is a rental.” it was awful. then she goes “do you want to blow up his life with me?” and honestly yeah. i did.

so we set up this family dinner confrontation at her parents’ place. i showed up early with wine and literal printed receipts. her parents greeted me like i’d come back from war. he walked in all fake charming. didn’t even see me at first. then emily goes “adam this is cora. you’ve been dating her for two and a half years.”

i watched his soul exit his body. he tried to play it off. tried to say i was obsessed with him. called me a stalker in front of his wife. so i just hit play on a voice memo of him two days earlier talking about leaving his “dead marriage.” her dad told him he had ten minutes to get out. he cried. he begged. her mom literally blocked him from touching her.

i dipped because i was shaking so hard.

thought that was it. nope.

emily texted me the next day like “i kicked him out. i’m filing. i need a roommate. do you want to move in?” and… i did. we packed his crap into trash bags. ate pizza. drank wine. made an eviction playlist at 2am. she looked at me and said “you’re the only person who knows what this feels like.” and it was weirdly true.

now i’m living in the house he used to pay for. helping with the kids. we see his car sometimes at his friend’s place. he cornered me once begging to talk. i told him “you dont have a we anymore.” he texted me from random numbers for weeks. tried to guilt me using pics of his kids. i finally snapped and said “you tore your family apart when you opened hinge not when i opened my dms.”

blocked him again.

and here’s the part i haven’t told a single real-life person.

i’m catching feelings for emily.

like real ones. not trauma bond jokes. i look at her in scrubs wrangling a toddler and my brain goes oh. i’d marry you and not lie once.

she steals my hoodies. makes my coffee perfect. falls asleep on my shoulder. but she’s grieving and i’m the other woman who wasn’t supposed to exist so i’m not acting on anything. i’m just here. in this weird life. making dinosaur pancakes for kids who call me “coco.”

sometimes we’re on the couch after bedtime and she looks at me and says “im glad it was you.” and i have this awful little thought that he might be the worst thing that ever happened to us but also the accidental reason i found my person.

i needed to dump this somewhere because it feels unreal in my own head.

tldr at this point is basically: dated a guy for 2.5 years. found out through instagram he’s married with two kids. his wife and i confronted him. kicked him out. moved in together. and now i’m kinda maybe falling for her.",32,1765382686.0,TrueOffMyChest,11,0.81,False

Modern flirting is a MESS. Between breadcrumbing, passive likes on stories, “accidental” touches, and unread DMs… it’s hard to tell if your crush is into you or just polite. Been there, studied that. Literally. Social cue misreading is one of the most common dating blind spots I noticed in my psych fieldwork and research bingeing on relationship science. And don’t get me started on the insane TikTok videos with “eye twitch = he loves you” takes.

So, if you're spiraling wondering whether your crush actually likes you or is just giving you false hope, here’s a researched-backed sanity check. No astrology. No pickup artist myths. Just solid psychology, behavioral patterns, and a little help from top relationship experts.

Let’s decode 10 subtle but real signs someone’s low-key into you.

# 1. They remember tiny things you said (even the weird stuff)

If someone recalls that obscure ramen spot you mentioned once in passing or brings up your favorite villain in a convo later, that’s not random. According to Dr. Helen Fisher, biological anthropologist and author of “Anatomy of Love,” people in love enter a heightened cognitive state where they remember even minor details about their object of affection. So if they’re quoting your random takes back to you weeks later, that’s interest with a capital I.

# 2. Their friends know about you

Crushes often leak into friend circles. It’s subconscious and very human. If you meet a friend of theirs who casually says, “Oh, I’ve heard about you,” congrats, you made it into their social script. A study from the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships (2010) found that people who are romantically interested tend to talk about their crush frequently to peers. Social signaling is real.

# 3. They mirror your body language (without realizing it)

This one is subtle, but powerful. Psychologist Tanya Chartrand coined the term “chameleon effect” for when people unconsciously mimic the gestures, posture, and speech of someone they like. If you cross your arms and they do the same a moment later, or you lean in and they follow,  it's a low-key green flag. Mirroring increases connection and trust. You can test it too.

# 4. They tease you…but in a respectful way

We’re not talking about playground-level insults here. Affectionate teasing is often a flirting tool. A study in the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior (Hall & Xing, 2015) found that subtle humor and teasing, when mutual and not cruel, serves as a bonding mechanism and can signal romantic intent. It’s risky, but if they're playfully challenging you and watching your reaction closely, they’re probably testing the waters.

# 5. They find “excuses” to be near you

If they’re always around in the most random scenarios,  signing up for the same club, showing up at your fave coffee spot “coincidentally,” or lingering even after the convo ends,  they’re making time for proximity. According to Dr. Albert Mehrabian's research on nonverbal attraction cues, physical closeness and directionality of the body (facing you, leaning in) are primal signs of attraction.

# 6. They get a little nervous or fidgety

Nervousness is a dead giveaway. Eye contact… then suddenly looking away. Playing with their sleeves. Laughing a little too hard. That’s attraction mixed with vulnerability. Dr. Joe Navarro, former FBI agent and body language expert, notes in his lectures that involuntary fidgeting, neck touching, or lip biting can be stress indicators,  often triggered by fear of judgment from someone they care about impressing.

# 7. Their texting behavior… changes

Check this: when someone likes you, their texting style often shifts. More quick replies. Random memes. Opening up about real stuff at 1am. Studies from the Pew Research Center show that digital intimacy is a major form of bonding now, especially among under-35s. If they’re consistently initiating or replying fast (especially to non-urgent messages), emotional investment is likely.

# 8. They subtly gatekeep your dating life

If they suddenly get weird when you talk about dating others (“Ohhh… you’re seeing someone?”) or they throw in humor-laced jabs (“He doesn’t sound like he deserves you”), they might be testing boundaries. Psychology professor Dr. David Buss notes that mate-guarding behavior, even in small doses, is a primal indicator of romantic interest. It's a protective instinct disguised as casual jealousy.

# 9. They hype you up more than your friends do

If they’re constantly dropping compliments way more than others do,  and it feels sincere, not performative,  that’s heavy interest. Compliments on weirdly specific things (your voice, your mannerisms, your ideas) are especially personal. Attachment theory researcher Amir Levine notes in his book “Attached” that people who are attracted tend to “notice and verbalize what makes the other person unique.”

# 10. You feel the vibe shift

This one is subjective but real. When someone likes you, the energy between you changes. Conversations feel more charged. Silences aren’t awkward. Eye contact lingers just a second too long. This gut feeling often aligns with reality, especially when paired with some of the signs above. Trust your read. Our brains are hardwired to pick up on micro-signals, even if we don’t consciously process them.

Want to go deeper on all this? These resources helped me dissect attraction like it's a science lab:

- The book “Attached” by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller,  this bestseller explains attachment styles and how they affect romance. It literally changed how I view dating. This is the best relationship psychology book to understand attraction from a behavioral lens.

- “The Art of Charm” podcast,  especially episodes featuring Vanessa Van Edwards and other behavioral scientists. They break flirting and social dynamics down into science-backed, actionable takes.

- YouTube: Charisma on Command,  their breakdowns of conversation dynamics and romantic psychology are insanely detailed but digestible. Watch their “How to Tell If Someone is Into You” video. 12M+ views for a reason.

- Book: “The Science of Happily Ever After” by Ty Tashiro,  this one dives into why we fall for who we fall for, and how to stop chasing the wrong types. NYT-reviewed, heavily cited, and an insanely satisfying read.

- App: BeFreed,  an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia grads and Google AI folks. It turns expert research, book summaries, and deep-dive interviews into personalized podcast-style lessons based on your interests. I’ve been using it to explore psychology topics like attraction, communication patterns, and attachment theory. You can literally ask it to break down “how to tell if someone likes you” and it’ll craft a tailored audio lesson on the spot,  voice, depth, and tone all customizable. Honestly, I’ve replaced a lot of doom-scrolling time with it and my brain feels 10x clearer.

- App: Finch,  this self-care and habit tracker app is lowkey great for emotional awareness. Helps you track moods, interactions, and how often your thoughts drift to a certain someone. Deliberate awareness is attractive.

- App: Ash,  kind of a hidden gem. Matches you with lowkey amazing relationship and communication coaches for micro-sessions. A great tool if you’re overthinking your next move or want to learn how to flirt without cringing.

1. Increases Eye-Muscle Strength

Looking left… looking right… zooming in like a detective…
Your eyes are basically doing a full workout.

Ophthalmologists hate this one simple trick.

2. Boosts “Motivation Hormones”

Some people drink coffee to stay awake.
Top students?
They watch a quick episode of “Advanced Human Biology.”

Instant focus.
Instant power.
Instant regret (optional).

3. Teaches You Geography

You didn’t know where Hungary, Czech Republic, or Ukraine were before…
Now suddenly you know entire maps.

What an educational platform 😭

4. Enhances Multitasking Skills

Holding your phone with one hand…
Scrolling…
Adjusting the volume…
Praying no one enters the room…

Elite military training.

5. Improves Psychology Knowledge

You become an expert in:

Human behavior

Facial expressions

Emotional intelligence

“Plot analysis”

“Step-sibling dynamics” (extremely advanced topic)

But last month, I woke up to the kind of knock that instantly spikes your heart rate. It was barely 6 AM, cold enough that I could see my breath inside the van, and I honestly thought it was a ranger or someone telling me to move along.

When I slid the side door open, it wasn’t a ranger. It was an older woman maybe mid-60s wrapped in a knitted cardigan with the kind of worried face that makes you instantly feel guilty even if you’ve done nothing wrong. Before I could say anything, she asked, Are you okay? Your lights were flickering all night.

My lights definitely weren’t flickering. Turns out, she had parked next to me late the previous evening because her Subaru started overheating on the mountain road. She tried to camp out in her car but got spooked when condensation on her windows made weird reflections. She saw the glow from my van and assumed I was also having some kind of electrical meltdown. Honestly, it was such a mom reaction it made me laugh.

I ended up making us both instant coffee while we checked her engine. I’m not a mechanic at all, but sometimes just having another human around makes a crappy situation feel manageable. We found out it was just her coolant running low. I had an extra unopened jug rolling around in a crate under my bed leftover from my own overheating scare a few months back. She insisted on paying me for it like aggressively insisted but I refused. She looked like she really needed someone to be kind to her that morning.

We sat on the little curb by the turnout while her car cooled down, passing the time talking about all the places she used to camp with her husband before he passed away. She said she was trying to teach herself not to be scared of being alone out here. That line stuck with me more than she probably knew.

After about an hour, her engine temperature went back to normal. She hugged me before she left one of those warm, sudden hugs from someone who’s grateful in a way they don’t have the words for. She drove off slowly, waving through the rear window. I never got her name, and she never asked for mine.

The whole thing reminded me why van life isn’t just about freedom or pretty views. It’s about these tiny, unexpected human moments that happen because we’re all out here trying our best in our own little moving homes. Some mornings we’re the ones needing help. Some mornings we’re the ones giving it.

I still think about her whenever I check my coolant now. Funny how a random dawn knock can stick with you longer than a hundred sunsets.",7,1765382240.0,VanLife,1,1.0,False

She planned it for weeks, picked specific perennials, laid out the spacing, even made a little diagram like it was a tiny botanical garden. We spent all Saturday digging, mixing compost, setting stones, planting, watering, the whole thing. By sunset it actually looked amazing and my wife was glowing and taking pictures from every angle.

We do not have a fence in the front yard, just a low walkway and a lot of foot traffic. There is also a very sweet but very dumb neighborhood dog, a big lab mix that everyone knows because he roams around in the evenings. I woke up Sunday, opened the door with my coffee, and nearly spit it out. The new flower bed looked like a crime scene. Plants flattened, dirt kicked everywhere, one little shrub completely uprooted and lying sideways. In the middle of the chaos was a perfect dog shaped nest dug right into the fresh soil. Paw prints all over the stones. Our neighbor later sent us a Ring clip of the dog carefully circling, kneading the soil like a cat and then flopping down for a solid night sleep.

My wife is taking it pretty well, but I can tell she is crushed after all that planning. We can replant most of it, but some of the new plants did not survive the ""lab tested"" quality check. For those of you who garden in unfenced front yards, what has actually worked to keep wandering dogs from turning beds into personal sandboxes. Motion lights, little fences, spicy spray.

I just bought my fleet carrier \~4 hours ago. 

I checked Steam. I bought this game on October 10, 2015, and played for \~50-60 hours.  
  
I  did not play again until earlier year, when I bought Odyssey. I am currently at 690.4 hours played. Clearly, there are things about this game that I enjoy.

I flagged this as humour, but I am only like 50% joking.



\---

\#1. WHY DOES THE COFFEE MAKER IN THE CARRIER COMMANDER'S OFFICE NOT WORK?? Seriously, this is my biggest issue. Completely immersion breaking. A simple Press \[E\], followed by a coffee cup pouring and the commander just picking it up to take a sip was too much? I am pretty sure some summer intern from 3rd year university can handle that, no?



\#2. On another, more serious note...why does my fleet carrier flight control speak to me like I am a stranger, when random flight controllers of male, female, chain-smoking robot/cyborg and other persuasions are all practically flirting when they welcome me back to stations I don't recall ever visiting.

**Examples**

* ""This carrier is currently accepting docking requests."" - *Yeah. No shit, Sherlock. It's my fucking carrier. Don't make me throw you out of an airlock.*
* ""Docking permissions will be granted following a successful eligibility scan"" - *How about I give your employment an eligibility scan?*
* ""Welcome to ***THIS*** carrier commander?"" - *DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO I AM?*
* ""Goodbye, Commander...Goodbye"". *The little bitch just passive aggressively double tapped me, goobyes. I swear to god...*



\---

Seriously...this is watery mashed potato levels of immersion. Skyrim city guards with weak knees provide more immersion than from this shit. The Bitching Betty from Mechwarrior games provides more immersion in every line compared to to this...

You call this a Space Sim? I call this a goddamn Space SIN!

Anyway, good job FDev on the other improvements during the period past 9-10 years. Makes the game playable, I guess. But this shit is weak.

He won't return","So the folk here at ""Super Large Construction Consultancy"" swear this is normal... My sibling, an engineer, says its both not and is; he agrees that an assistant is effectively the office bish, but that they're taking it to an extreme. 

I don't mind learning, and 90% of the staff are super appreciative of me. The PMs have given me bonuses and sent compliments to corporate, taught me stuff about project management, training me on various field and lab work... 

 Corporate fleet liasons likewise have said I've done a great job, as when I got here in August, 11 company vehicles ordered in 2024 had been waiting for pickup since June, and 43 cars had last been registered in 2022. 

My direct boss, though, acts as if I'm their personal serf and writes angry emails constantly, and is always adding more job titles to mine then focusing on random stuff. Like last 1 on 1 took me to task for ""low coffee pods"", ""you had to be told to stock toilet paper."", but we had three trucks die on lot when the cofree pods had ran low, so I figured fixing the trucks took priority. 

Sometimes she'll report me to corporate then get angry with me when they side with me. Stuff like ""___ has been sending schedules at 3:30, which is late.""- boss ""Well, ____, the contract is they must be sent by 5:00, preferably 3:30. He is right on time, actually""- corporate. 

Trying to send me to retrieve a truck is the latest weird moment. Because four PMs and a field supe just turned to look at her nearly in unison. That makes me really feel my direct is acting out, cause these guys have been in construction before I was born. 

I'm just... I know Rochester NY is a bad spot, the job markets been awful since I got my BS in communications/environ studies in '23 (stacked on top of  an A.a.S in wood tech, smh).. i keep trying to find a better career path, but am hoping this can turn into something good, yk?

1pj5shb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CookingwithDebs/comments/1pj5shb/guinness_gingerbread_cookies_no_molasses_needed/,Guinness Gingerbread Cookies: No Molasses Needed,"**Guinness Gingerbread Cookies**

These cookies are slightly chewy, warmly spiced, and deeply flavored, all without using molasses.

Every family has that one cookie that feels like Christmas, and for my mother, it was gingerbread. One year, she asked if I would bake some for the holidays. The only problem was that I have never liked molasses, so gingerbread simply was not something I made. Still, when your mother asks for something at Christmas, you find a way. 

So I began experimenting.

I already loved cooking and baking with Guinness, and reducing it reveals a deep, warm, caramel-like richness that echoes molasses without the sharp bitterness. It turned out to be the perfect foundation for a gingerbread cookie I could actually enjoy.

These cookies hold their shape well and have a perfect ginger kick. And even though I never liked traditional gingerbread, this version became a favorite. Best of all, my mother loved them.

 

**Ingredients** 

**Cookies**

1 bottle Guinness stout, 11.2 ounces (330 ml)

2 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (300 g)

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 tablespoon ground ginger

1 teaspoon cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon cloves

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (113 g)

1/2 cup granulated sugar (100 g)

1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed (110 g)

1 large egg

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger (4 g)

2 tablespoons crystallized (candied) ginger (20 g)

 

**Optional Irish Cream Icing**

1 cup powdered sugar (120 g)

1-2 tablespoons Irish cream

 

**Method**

 

**Reduce the Guinness** 

Pour the full 11.2-ounce bottle of Guinness into a small saucepan.

Simmer gently until you have 2 ounces, which equals 4 tablespoons (60 ml). This usually takes about 15–20 minutes, depending on your stove and pan.

Keep an eye on it while it simmers so it does not reduce too far or burn. You do not need to stir it.

If you are unsure whether it has reduced enough, carefully pour it into a heatproof measuring cup, such as Pyrex, to check the volume.

If you have more than 2 ounces, return it to the saucepan and continue reducing.

If it over-reduces and becomes thick or sticky, stir in 1-2 teaspoons of hot water until it becomes a smooth, pourable syrup again. A small amount of water will not weaken the flavor.

The reduction will thicken slightly as it cools; measure by volume rather than appearance.

Let the reduction cool completely before using.

 

**Make the dough**

  
Very finely mince the crystallized (candied) ginger and set aside.  
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.  
In a large bowl, cream the softened butter with the granulated sugar and light brown sugar until light and fluffy.  
Beat in the egg and vanilla.  
Add the cooled Guinness reduction, the freshly grated ginger, and the crystallized (candied) ginger. Mix just until combined.  
Add the dry ingredients in two portions, and mix just until the dough comes together.

 

**Chill** 

Gather the dough into a disk, wrap it well, and refrigerate. Chilling the dough overnight gives the best flavor and easiest rolling. If you are baking the same day, chill for at least 2 hours.

Longer chilling improves flavor, firms the dough, and helps the cookies keep their shape during cutting and baking.

 

**Roll and Cut**

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175 °C).

Lightly flour your surface and rolling pin, then roll the dough to about ¼-inch thickness. This is roughly the height of two stacked quarters.

Re-flour lightly as needed if the dough starts to stick. Avoid using too much flour, as it can change the cookie’s texture.

Cut into shapes or rounds. An inverted glass works well for rounds.

Transfer the cutouts to a parchment-lined baking sheet and chill them for about 10 minutes before baking. This helps prevent spreading while keeping the edges clean and sharp.

 

**Bake** 

Bake 8-10 minutes for slightly chewy cookies. The edges should look set, and the centers may still look slightly soft.

For crisp or structural cookies, bake 2-3 minutes longer. Do not exceed this, or the cookies may overbrown and become bitter.

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely before icing.

The cookies will feel soft when they come out of the oven, but will firm up as they cool.

 

**Irish Cream Icing** 

The cookies are delicious on their own, but the Irish cream icing is a nice optional addition for a holiday touch. 

Sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl so the icing is smooth and free of lumps.  
Whisk the sifted powdered sugar with 1-2 tablespoons of Irish cream until smooth.

Add more Irish cream for a thinner icing that drizzles easily, or add a little extra powdered sugar for a thicker consistency that holds its shape for piping.

Any leftover icing is great in coffee. It’s also wonderful drizzled on pancakes or French toast.

Ice the cookies only when they are completely cooled, or the icing will melt off.

 

**Storage**

 Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to one week.  
Baked cookies can be frozen, with or without icing, for 3-4 months.  
The dough can also be frozen for 3-4 months. Wrap it well, and thaw it in the refrigerator before rolling.

 

**Note** 

**Why three gingers?**

  
Using ground, fresh, and crystallized ginger gives these cookies layers of flavor. The ground ginger adds warmth, the fresh ginger adds brightness, and the crystallized ginger adds tiny, chewy pops of sweetness. I first learned about using ginger in multiple forms from chef Lorraine Pascale on one of the holiday baking shows, and it completely changed the way I approach ginger cookies. It creates a balanced and deeper ginger flavor without overwhelming the cookie.",1,1765381317.0,u_CookingwithDebs,0,1.0,False

\*\*\*

Hey! Hey, excuse me- Yes, you! Would you please come with me for a moment. No, I'm not trying to sell anything. Here: Special Agent \[name\], FBI. Would you please come with me now.

No, no, you're not under arrest. Uhm, I mean, we just need to clarify a few- uhm- Dangit, just come with me, will you! See, there's a café over there, they have a free table, we can just take a seat. What? Oh, seriously! No, you don't need a lawyer! Will you- Yeah, I didn't read you your rights. And just because we don't always do that doesn't mean an arrest is invalid, you know? Also, I already told you you are not getting arrested! So can you just shut up and sit down? Okay, sit down or I will arrest you for real! Ugh, finally!

Okay, you wanna drink anything? Coffee? Tea? Hot chocolate? We could also have a piece of cake if you- okay, will you stop staring at me like that? You look like you're scared I might tackle you and drag you into an unmarked van any moment. What's your problem? Why are you so stiff? I'll have a black tea, by the way. And they make some really good gooseberry pie here! But if you'd rather-

\[sigh\] Okay, what is it? No, you didn't do anything wrong. Well, actually you did a lot of things wrong. You did a lot of things *tremendously* wrong, which is why I am here to talk to you, but you did nothing “tackle and unmarked van” levels of wrong. So could you please calm down and order a drink? You can also have a soda or something if you want. It'll be my treat.

Okay, so- I am your FBI agent. Huh? Your FBI agent! You know, the one assigned to monitoring your online activities to make sure you're not doing anything illegal. Yeah, of course you have an FBI agent! No, we don't suspect you to be involved in anything. *Everyone* has an FBI agent. Even I have an FBI agent. And that guy has an FBI agent, as well. And- Yeah, of course that works! Oh, please, we are the Federal Bureau of Investigation, we are above menial concepts such as logic or reason.

Well, anyway, I am your FBI agent, and for the past couple of years, I have been monitoring your internet activity – oh, while we're at it, don't buy that graphic card! The seller is scamming you! It's a cheap Chinese knock-off, it'll probably fall apart before you even manage to install it!

Well, but that's not what I wanted to talk to you about. I actually wanted to talk about- what? Gosh, no! This is not about those mushrooms you bought online! I mean, in the end you only ended up buying some oyster mushrooms from a scammer, so no harm, no foul! Nobody needs to know that you actually intended to buy shiitake mushrooms, right?

But that's not what I wanted to talk to you about, either. What I came to talk to you about is your dating history! Hey, what is it? Oh, come on! No, I think we *do* need to talk about that! I'm sorry? I've been monitoring your online activities for the past couple of years, buddy, so let me assure you: We *do* need to talk about it!

Oh, you are doing “just fine”, is that so? Did they recently change the definition of “fine” so that it also includes “the last girl I texted with dumped me because I wouldn't shut up about Genshin Impact”? No? Well then, I guess you are not doing all that fine after all.

Okay, whom are you trying to fool here? I know your browser history, remember? You looked up four different “how to kiss someone” tutorials in one month. We definitely, *definitely* need to talk.

Listen, buddy. I'm off the clock here. I'm off-duty. Inofficial. I'm not talking to you as a special agent right now, I'm just talking to you as, uhm, a lady that knows every intimate detail of your private life and is just trying to help you. You know, “serve and protect” and all that.

Yeah, uhm, well, the thing is- I am not actually- I am not actually supposed to talk to you. But, well, you see- So every day in sit in my cubicle and watch you using those dating apps and I see you doing everything wrong that you possibly could do wrong! Ugh, it's like watching a horror movie where the protagonist goes “Hey, let's split up! And I'll go investigate that mysterious noise in the dark forest outside our remote cabin built on an ancient Native American burial ground where a legendary serial killer murdered and ate thirteen people on this very night fifty years ago!” - and you wanna shout at them “No! Don't do that! That would be unimaginably stupid!”. But they're on the wrong side of the screen, you know? So all you can do is sit there and watch them ruin their life.

Uhm, no, buddy, I don't think I'm exaggerating anything. You *are* doing everything wrong that you possibly could, and you *are* ruining your life in the process. Oh, yeah? And what about “Kimberley”? Remember Kimberley? Oh, looks like you do. Come on, don't give me that! You got catfished with some AI generated images and you sent “Kimberley” a whole bunch of money so she could buy “a plane ticket to come over from Canada and visit her cute little blueberry muffin”. So, here's your reality check: “Kimberley” is teenage boy from Minnesota and that money you sent him went into buying an Xbox Game Pass - so in a way he fell for a scam as well, I guess. But seriously, weren't you getting a tiny little bit suspicious over Kimberley's unusual number of fingers? Oh, you didn't want to be discriminatory? Well, that's nice of you, I guess. And it didn't bother you that the number of fingers was not consistent between photos? Okay, you must be really desperate.

Hey, listen, buddy, I didn't approach you just to tell you you're an idiot. I mean, I am *also* doing it to tell you you're an idiot, because, I mean, holy crap! Starbucks is not a suitable place for a first date! No wonder she didn't call you back! For a first date you gotta go to a place that's a bit more special, a bit more personal, something with an atmosphere, like a cute little café – something like this place here! Well, anyway, I am primarily doing this to try and help you!

What do you mean, why? Because I have to watch your every move and if I have to keep on watching you wreck one more date by being awkward and cringe and, well- *you* – I think I might die of second hand embarrassment.

Okay, we can either keep on arguing about whether or not you are terrible at flirting – which you are! - or we can instead talk about how you'll get better at it. Your call!

Okay, so, imagine you were on a date. You know, with a really stunningly beautiful, charming, funny, intelligent girl. The girl of your dreams! You wanna make absolutely sure that the date goes well so that she'll want to go on a second date with you. So, imagine you are sitting with this superhumanly enchanting girl in a café and you are having black tea and gooseberry pie, how would you talk to her? Start a conversation that intrigues her and makes her want to find out more about you?

Ugh, bad start! You don't just start a conversation with telling her how pretty she is! That is totally bland and unoriginal, plus it'll make her think you are objectifying her and only want her for her looks. You should ask her about her interests, her hobbies, her aspirations. What makes her tick, what keeps her going, you know?

Yeah, like that! A bit heavy-handed, maybe, but hey, you're still learning. So, now imagine you find out that this perfect girl likes all the same video games you do, and watches the same anime you do, and scrolls through all the same subreddits you do – I mean, big deal, I have to monitor your online activity, so I have to scroll through all the subreddits you do by default, but- Huh? Oh, uhm, never mind!

Anyway, let's just imagine you now managed to get a good conversation going, and the girl likes you and is smiling at you and holding eye contact and touching your arm and stuff – about like *this*! So, now's the time to throw in a few well-placed compliments to try and charm her. So, show me what you got!

Oh, come on, really? You can't seriously expect to charm a girl with such cookie-cutter compliments! Don't just tell a girl you like her eyes! That is such a cliché! You gotta go into details! What do you like about her eyes? The colour? The way the light sparkles in them? Come on, get creative! Yeah, well, uhm, *I* am sitting right in front of you. So you could use *my* eyes to practise compliments on.

Aww, you really think so? No, no, go on! You should practice compliments some more – so you'll get more fluent in them! Huh? Aww, you! \[giggles\]

Okay, so now you have a conversation going, give your date some intel on you! You know, about your hobbies, your interests - like, what do you do outside of your computer? What do you think about after you log out late at night? What do you do outside the view of your webcam?

What? Me? No, I'm not curious! Not at all! These are perfectly normal questions a date might ask you. I'm just trying to get you ready for it. See, I'm just trying to help you! What do you mean, “why”? Because I sit in my cubicle every day watching you being cringe and awkward, but I also see that you have a great taste in music and anime and games and that you are really thoughtful and sweet and that deep down you are probably a really nice person and you don't deserve to be so lonely. Dude, I've seen your private mode searches, you are really lonely. Sometimes you are lonely several times a day! And don't even get me started on your YouTube history! I mean, “Soft-Dom Mommy Kitsune Washes Your Hair After A Stressful Day”? Are you for real?

Listen, sweetie, I'm not here to put you down! I really think that you deserve someone. Someone who sees how wonderful you are, how kind and funny and good at Call Of Duty. Someone who sees you the way I see- uhm, you know, just someone who really, really likes you. But you will never find someone like that if you keep on wrecking every single conversation you have with a girl, ever! You really need to learn how to talk to a girl without sounding like a total derp!

Yes, you do. Oh yes, you do! Oh, sure, you're a true womanizer, aren't you? You don't need any help. Certainly! Fine then, why don't you show me your game? Show me the magic! If you really don't want my help, then show me – how do you charm a lady on your first date?

Oh! Okay, yeah, that is a good start. \[getting increasingly flustered\] Oh, this old thing? I really just put it on this morning because- Oh. Uhm, yeah, that would be a really nice thing to say to a girl you're on a date with. I guess. Oh! Okay, that is very specific. I guess I do have- Okay, uhm, now that we now that you do have some rizz, I think we can stop this and advance to the next- oh! Uhm, I think you can stop it with the compliments now. I see that you are good at them if you really want to, so maybe we can- No! No, I'm not blushing! Why would I be blushing? I mean, it's not like you were complimenting *me*, right? We are just practising. Just practising for the occasion when you go on a real date with- huh?

You- you did mean me? But I am just here to help you learn how to flirt with a girl when you're on a- Yeah, I am a girl. And we are- No! We are just sitting in a cute little café together and having tea and- No, this is not a date! And I am not blushing! I am a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation! I have undergone extreme and extensive training with rope climbing and obstacle courses – the whole Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs shit! I have absolute control over my bodily functions! I can at will lower my heart rate to a point where a lie detector would think I'm already dead! So I am definitely not blushing! No, I'm not cute when I'm blushing!

Huh? You want to- wait, are you asking me out?! Uhm, well, yeah, okay, I would love to go on a date with you, some day- Right now? Uhm, okay, yeah, why not? What did you have in mind? Yeah, a café sounds nice. Yeah, you're right, we're already sitting in a café. Oh, I would love some black tea. And a piece of gooseberry pie. That sounds really nice. Wait, does that mean that we're on a date *right now*? Oh, uhm, in that case, could you say those things again, you know, about my eyes and my smile and so on?

Aww, you're cute! No, I'm not bl- yeah, okay, I am blushing. It's fine, I'm off duty. Just keep talking! I like your voice.",3,1765381255.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

**\~\~\~**

Pain dragged Jin awake.

Not sharp—just there. Everywhere. Like someone had taken him apart, shaken all the pieces in a box, and reassembled him wrong. His head throbbed. His ribs complained with every breath. Even his eyelids hurt.

*What... the hell...*

  
He forced his eyes open. Vision swam, unfocused and blurry at the edges. Shapes resolved slowly—dim lights hung from the ceiling, off-white and water-stained. Medical supplies scattered on a nightstand.

Jin tried to move.

His body screamed objections.

He froze, breathing shallow, waiting for the pain to settle into something manageable. Gradually, details filtered through the haze. Bandages wrapped his torso—tight, professional. His right arm rested in what looked like a makeshift fracture sling, strapped against his chest. Loose rugged gown.

  
*Okay. Not dead, and all of my limbs are still attached… both eyes are working. That's... a start, at least.*

  
With his free hand—the left one, the one that didn't feel like it was held together with spite and duct tape—he checked under the blanket.

Underwear. Still there.

Jin exhaled in relief. ""At least they left me some dignity.""

He let his head fall back against the pillows, staring at the ceiling. Every muscle felt wrong. Not just sore—*stuffed*. Like someone had pumped him full of concrete while he was unconscious.

Somewhere beyond the door, muffled voices. The faint hum of essence in the air—wards, probably. Security enchantments.

  
*Am I back at the hideout? How long was I out?*

  
He focused on breathing. In. Out. Slow. Measured.

The pain didn't disappear. But it... settled. Became background noise instead of a screaming alarm.

  
*Okay. Status check.*

  
""Narrator,"" Jin muttered, voice rough like he'd gargled sandpaper. ""Status report. How bad am I?""

The familiar presence stirred in his mind—cold, analytical, utterly unbothered by Jin's current state of falling apart.

  
***« With the Harvest successfully completed, feedback pushed significant vitality into your system. Combined with your team's medical intervention, most injuries have stabilized. »***

***« Current assessment: »***

***« Right orbital region: Severe bruising. Source of current headache. »***

***« Chest wound: Twelve-centimeter laceration, recently sutured. Healing in progress. Estimated recovery: four days. »***

***« Right arm: Bones mended via essence-assisted regeneration. Structural integrity: seventy-three percent. Full function restoration: two days. »***

***« Recommendation: Rest. Without an elite-grade healing skill, instant recovery is not feasible. Cease unnecessary movement. »***

  
Jin huffed something that might've been a laugh if it didn't hurt so much. ""So basically, shut up and lie down.""

  
***« Correct. »***

  
""Great. Love it when you're straightforward.""

He closed his eyes, letting the breathing pattern do its work. His mind drifted, replaying fragments—the fight, Vellakin's grin, the way Iron Howl had glowed blue-white with everything he'd channeled into that last shot, and the ridiculous powers of Joe.

  
*I won. Barely.*

  
""Cryo affinity's insane,"" Jin murmured.

A harsh cough wracked his body. He ran his tongue over dry lips, tasting copper. Blood.

  
*And I really need to start on the mage path. Seriously.*

  
Sorceries are versatile, no doubt. Useful. But having to speak incantations mid-combat was just inviting someone to punch him in the throat at the worst possible moment.

The problem gnawed at him. He'd barely scraped by against Vellakin, and that was with Joe pulling a miracle save. Next time? He might not be so lucky.

  
*And from three-verse sorceries up, I'll need entity permissions. That's... complicated. Hell, I don’t even know if they would even pick up my call.*

  
Jin ran his good hand through his hair, wincing when his fingers brushed against a particularly tender spot on his scalp.

  
*Need countermeasures. For everything. At least for the common ways I can get screwed.*

  
His thoughts circled back to Joe. The way he'd appeared through that spatial rift, grinning like he hadn't just torn through an ORDER IV spatial seal like tissue paper.

  
*Joe's strong. Really damn strong.*

  
Stronger than Jin had realized. He is probably just a step away from ORDER V rank.

  
*I would've died without him.*

  
The thought sat heavy in his chest. Heavier than the bandages. Heavier than the pain.

Jin shoved it down. Locked it away in the same mental box where he kept all the other inconvenient truths about mortality and luck and borrowed time.

*Focus on what matters. What did I get from the harvest?*

Jin opened his eyes, staring at the ceiling. ""Narrator. Show me the Harvest.""

Blue light flickered in his peripheral vision.

Jin stared at the readout.

  
*Holy shit.*

  
Those stat numbers—VIT, STR, END—they were insane. No wonder his body felt wrong. It was being rebuilt from the inside out, forced to accommodate power that would've crushed him a week ago.

""Shit... those are a lot of stat points. That should just straight up max my stats to overlimits!"" Jin muttered.

  
**« Correct. Stat integration causes a temporary physiological adjustment period. Discomfort will fade. »**

  
""Temporary. Right."" He bit his lip, focusing on the next line. ""Also, I'm curious about forty-two units of Latent Aura. What does that even mean? I mean, how do you put that in numbers?""

  
***« Latent Aura is the manifestation of one’s existential will against reality. »***

*«* ***It is accumulated through unique experiences, overcoming adversity, and surviving impossible odds. It represents your claim to existence—your refusal to be erased.*** *»*

  
Jin sighed. “I know that… What I’m asking is about the numbers!”

  
« **Breakthrough thresholds:** »

« **ORDER I: One unit.** »

« **ORDER II: Ten units.** »

« **ORDER III: Fifty units.** »

« **ORDER IV: Two hundred units.** »

« **ORDER V: One thousand units.** »

  
""That's good to know, but I didn't ask that!"" Jin's cough got worse after he shouted.

  
***« … »***

  
“You know what, leave it…” Jin scrolled back through the harvest results, attention snagging on the skill fragments.

Entropy Zone. Spatial Seal. Combat Mastery.

And that last one—Blessing of Maw. Incompatible.

""Blessing of Maw—that's because of my soul, right?""

  
***« Correct. »***

***« \[Blessing of Maw\] is for soulless beings, and you are unfortunately not a soulless being. However, fragments can be repurposed. »***

  
""Good enough."" Jin nodded slowly; his eyes lingered on Spatial Seal and Entropy Zone.

  
*Those are sick. Trapping enemies, denying escape routes, decay fields...*

  
He stared at the readout a moment longer, then dismissed it with a mental flick. ""I call for my Mantle.""

Jin froze.

  
*Wait.*

  
He stared at it. Blinked. Stared harder.

  
*WAIT.*

  
""I BROKE THROUGH TO ORDER II?!""

Pain exploded through his ribs as he tried to sit up. His breath caught, vision whiting out for a second as every injury screamed in unison. Jin gasped, collapsing back against the pillows, clutching his chest with his free hand.

  
*Ow. Ow ow ow. Bad idea. Very bad idea.*

  
""Fuck,"" he wheezed. *I need to find a healing skill.*

The door slammed open.

Jin's head snapped toward the sound—instant regret as his neck muscles screamed in protest.

  
*Oh, c'mon. Why is everything broken? Damn... It hurts.*

  
""You're awake."" Rudy stood in the doorway, shoulders tense, knuckles white where his hand gripped the doorframe. ""Sure got a lot of energy if you can yell that loud.""

Jin tried for casual. ""Yeah, man. Takes more than an ORDER IV monster to—""

""Don't.""

One word. That was all Rudy said.

But it carried enough weight to make Jin shut his mouth.

Rudy walked into the room. Slow. Deliberate. Each step measured like he was physically restraining himself from doing something rash.

He stopped at the foot of Jin's bed. Stared.

Minutes passed in silence.

Jin watched Rudy's chest rise and fall—too fast, too shallow. The tell-tale signs of someone fighting for control.

  
*Okay, the silence is killing me… let’s start with something good…*

  
""Bro,"" Jin managed, voice strained. “I'm ORDER II now.""

Rudy blinked. ""...What?""

""Order. Two. I broke through.""

For a moment, Rudy just stared. Then his expression shifted—relief flooding in first, washing across his face like a wave. But something darker followed immediately after, tightening his features.

He looked... upset.

No. Not upset.

*Pissed.*

""You..."" Rudy's voice cracked. He stopped, swallowed hard. ""You're seriously sitting here grinning about stats when you almost died?""

Jin's grin faltered.

""Jin, I—"" Rudy stopped, turning away, running a hand through his hair. When he turned back, his eyes were hard. ""Do you have any idea how close you were? Joe said when he found you, half your chest was *melted* from that decay field. You were bleeding out. Your arm was—"" He cut himself off, jaw working. ""You were dying.""

""Rudy—""

""No."" Rudy's voice went sharp.""You don't get to 'Rudy' me. You're so smart, aren't you? Then where were your exit plans?"" He took a step closer. ""What the hell were you thinking?""

Jin met his eyes. ""I was thinking I had a job to do and a narrow window to do it. The ritual's compromised. Vellakin's dead. Mission accomplished.""

""Mission accomplished?"" Rudy's voice pitched higher. ""You could've been dead, Jin—""

He stopped. Breathing hard. His hands trembled slightly before he shoved them into his pockets.

Silence stretched between them.

Jin's ribs throbbed. His head pounded. But under Rudy's anger, he could see the fear. The same fear Jin had felt watching Rudy charge into danger time and again.

""But I'm not,"" Jin said quietly. ""I'm here. Breathing. Annoying you."" He tried for a smile. ""That counts for something, right?""

Rudy stared at him. Then his shoulders sagged, the fight bleeding out. ""You're not doing this alone anymore.""

""Rudy—""

""I don't care if you're ORDER II, ORDER X, or the next coming of some dead god."" Rudy's voice was rough. ""We're partners. That means you don't get to play hero and leave me wondering if you're gonna come back in a body bag. Got it?""

""You're really annoying when you're right,"" Jin said finally.

""Yeah, well."" Rudy shrugged. ""Someone's gotta keep your suicidal ass alive.""

Jin huffed a weak laugh. ""Asshole.""

""Takes one to know one.""

The door opened again—slower this time. Joe leaned in, arms crossed, grinning like he'd just won a bet.

""Heard yelling. Figured the hero was awake.""

Reyana appeared behind him, expression flat. ""I missed the fight.""

Joe strolled in, hands in his pockets, all casual confidence. Reyana followed, her sharp gaze flicking over Jin's bandages.

""So,"" Joe said, stopping at the foot of the bed. ""ORDER II. Congrats. You're officially less pathetic.""

""Your faith in me is touching.""

Joe laughed. ""Hey, you survived an ORDER IV. That's worth something. Most people?"" He made a squelching gesture. ""Boom. You? Merely *tenderized*.""

""Thanks for the save, Joe.""

""Don't mention it."" Joe's expression softened, just slightly. ""We're a team now."" He glanced at Reyana, who nodded once. ""Reyana and I will head out first. In the meantime, Rudy—get Jin something decent to wear.""

Rudy nodded. ""Okay.""

Joe clapped him on the shoulder as he passed, then paused at the door. ""Oh, and Jin? Don't scare us like that again.""

The door closed behind them.

""Come on, let's get you dressed,"" Rudy offered his hand. ""Salvatore wants to see you. And we've got a shit ton of loot to sort through.""

Jin took it, gritting his teeth as Rudy helped him sit up, then stand. His legs wobbled. His ribs protested every movement. But he stayed upright, right arm in its cast pressed tight against his chest.

""Loot,"" Jin muttered, limping toward the door with Rudy staying close. ""Now you're speaking my language. Though what’s wrong with the gown, Rudy?”

“Oh, that… well, that gown is open from the back”

Jin froze mid-step. ""What?!""

Rudy's lips twitched. ""Yeah. Full moon on display.""

""You could've led with that!""

""Where's the fun in that?""

  
**✦✦✦**

  
The meeting room was larger than Jin expected.

High ceilings. Reinforced walls with ward-lines etched into the corners. A long table dominated the center, scarred from use but solid. Three people waited.

Joe sprawled on the couch like he owned it, one leg thrown over the armrest, arms spread wide along the back. Casual. Relaxed.

Reyana stood by a desk stacked with neat piles of documents. She turned when they entered, face as unreadable as ever.

Salvatore sat at the table, cleaning a blade. He paused mid-stroke when he saw Jin. ""You look like shit, by the way.""

""Feel like it too.""

""Good."" Salvatore’s voice dropped, just slightly. Just enough. ""Means you're alive to feel anything.""

Rudy helped Jin to the couch. Jin sank into it gratefully, muscles trembling from the short walk. Sweat beaded at his temples.

*How long was I out that standing is this exhausting?*

  
Reyana nodded at him. Not quite a smile, but close. ""I didn't tell you before, but I'm glad you're not dead.""

Jin raised an eyebrow. ""Thank you…""

""Would've been inconvenient."" She tilted her head slightly, a small grin tugging at her lips. ""We still need you.""

""Wow. I'm touched.""

Joe snorted from the couch.

Salvatore set down his blade. His attention shifted to Rudy first, then to Jin. The weight of an ORDER VI entity's focus—an Overlord's—settled over them like a physical presence.

""You both did well.""

The words were simple. Direct. No embellishment.

But they carried weight.

Salvatore's gaze focused on Rudy. ""Seeing a technique once and replicating even a fraction of it... Most take years to reach that level of attunement with their path."" A pause. ""Your Asura breakthrough accelerated more than just your body.""

Rudy tried not to show how much that meant.

Failed spectacularly.

His shoulders straightened slightly. Chin lifted. Pride is warring with his natural tendency toward self-doubt.

""Just... instinct, I guess,"" he said.

""Instinct honed by discipline,"" Salvatore corrected. ""And your skill—it broke through to Elite mastery during the Delta assault.""

Rudy's eyes went wide. ""Wait. Actually?""

Salvatore nodded once.

""Holy shit,"" Rudy breathed.

Then Salvatore turned to Jin.

""Facing an ORDER IV entity alone and surviving is impressive."" His eyes—dark and measuring—held Jin's. ""Fatally wounding it before extraction...""

He trailed off. Let the silence speak.

Jin shifted uncomfortably. ""Joe did most of the heavy lifting.""

""Don't sell yourself short!"" Joe called from the kitchen, voice echoing. ""You cracked that core open like an egg. I just redirected your bullet and opened a door on the guy.""

Salvatore's lips twitched—the closest thing to a smile Jin had seen from him. ""Humility is admirable. But do not diminish your accomplishment. You have earned your breakthrough.""

Jin didn't know what to say to that. So he just nodded.

""However."" Salvatore's expression didn't change, but something in his tone shifted. ""Take this incident as a warning. There are forces in this world beyond comprehension. Life is unpredictable, even for the strong."" His gaze sharpened. ""Remember: brilliance without caution becomes martyrdom.""

The words hung in the air.

""Noted,"" Jin said quietly.

""Oh, it's been almost fifteen hours since the attack,"" Reyana spoke, looking at Jin. Her fingers traced the edge of one of the document stacks—a small, unconscious gesture. ""If you were wondering.""

""Fifteen hours?"" Jin's head snapped toward her. “That’s a lot of time…”

""Yeah. So were your injuries."" Reyana shrugged, pulling five spatial rings from her pocket. She slid them across the coffee table with practiced ease. A small smirk played at the corner of her mouth. ""Warehouse looting went smoothly. Very smooth.""

""What'd we get?""

""Haven't checked yet,"" Rudy said.

“Hmm… Why not?”

Reyana's expression didn't change. ""We were waiting for you."" She gestured at the document stacks. ""I took a quick look at the documents, but nothing made sense... so we all, on Joe's advice, decided to rest.""

Jin nodded, setting the ring down. ""Understandable.""

""I did find various references to 'the Grand Working' and timetables, though,"" Reyana noted, tapping the top document. ""Repeated. Consistent.""

  
S*o we're on the clock. Still.*

  
Jin set down the ring. His expression shifted, humor fading into something more serious.

""The ritual chamber I found,"" he said slowly. ""It's worse than we thought.""

The room went quiet.

Everyone's attention sharpened.

""It’s a part of *Convergence Ritual.*"" Jin continued. ""It's a node in a larger array. Tier 7 classification.""

Salvatore went very still. ""Tier 7. That's...""

“That chamber is a smaller-scale mapping of the primary Tier 7 ritual, and its purpose is to extract all the essence and lifeforce."" Jin finished. ""Basically, population conversion into a singular divine avatar. Yeah.""

Horror dawned on Rudy's face. ""They're turning everyone in Vienna into—what, fuel?""

""Fuel for something. Someone."" Jin's jaw clenched. “I guess that’s why there are no survivors.”

“Oh, and I managed to introduce a Trojan into the ritual...” Jin leaned back against the couch, exhaustion pulling at him. “It's spreading through their network now. It’ll take time, but eventually, I'll have access to corrupt the whole system from a distance.""

""And then?"" Reyana asked.

""Then, in our final battle—whenever that is..."" Jin's eyes hardened. ""I should be able to stop the ritual. Just for a couple of moments. But it might be enough.""

""Good."" Salvatore stood, moving toward what passed for a kitchen area—a small counter, portable camping stove, supplies stacked in crates. ""All in all, our first mission went well."" He glanced back. ""We will discuss the details later. For now, you need food. All of you. Recovery requires fuel.""

Jin blinked. ""You cook?""

""I sustain. Don't expect artistry.""

Joe stage-whispered to Jin: ""Translation: military rations. Pray for your taste buds.""

""I heard that,"" Salvatore said without turning.

""You were meant to!""

Jin actually laughed.

Immediately regretted it as pain lanced through his ribs, but the laugh escaped anyway—genuine and unbidden.

Rudy grinned. ""Oh man, you should see your face when you laugh. Like someone's stabbing you.""

""Someone DID stab me,"" Jin protested. ""Repeatedly. I have wounds to prove it.""

""Yeah, because you went—""

""If you say 'went alone' one more time—""

""WENT ALONE.""

Jin grabbed a cushion with his good hand and threw it.

Rudy caught it easily, laughing.

""You're both idiots,"" Reyana observed from her spot by the window. But her voice had softened. Just slightly.

""Takes one to know one, Reyana."" Jin shot back.

*This is what a team feels like. What family feels like.*

The thought came unbidden, but it felt... right.

For the first time since waking, some of the tension in his chest eased.

But here, surrounded by people who'd waited fifteen hours just to make sure he woke up, it didn't feel quite so heavy.

1pj5kqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1pj5kqr/pulled_up_the_gross_old_carpet_and_accidentally/,Pulled up the gross old carpet and accidentally scored my favorite part of the house,"When we bought this place I mentally filed the living room as ""future project"" and then kind of ignored it. The carpet was that sad beige that never looks clean, with a couple of mysterious stains the previous owners claimed were ""just coffee"". The room always felt a bit dingy even after we painted and changed the lighting. A few weeks ago I finally snapped when my kid spilled juice and it basically disappeared into the carpet in slow motion. I told my partner I was at least pulling one corner up to see what was under there. Worst case I figured we would bite the bullet and budget for new flooring next year. So I cut a neat little triangle in the corner by the vent, grabbed the pliers and pulled. Under the carpet pad I saw wood. Not plywood, not laminate. Actual old hardwood boards with a ton of grime and some paint splatters, but they looked solid. That was the start of ""well, we already started, might as well keep going"". By the end of the afternoon we had the entire room down to bare wood, just piles of carpet and pad on the driveway, and a dog who thought we had invented a new crunchy playground for her.  



The floor was honestly ugly at first glance, very orange in spots, dark stripes where old rugs must have been, and a million staple holes. But the boards were tight, no soft spots, no big gaps. I called one local floor guy just to get a reality check and he basically said, ""If you are willing to do the annoying prep, I can come in and sand and finish it for you for not-crazy money."" So we spent a weekend pulling every staple and random nail, patching a couple of small gouges with wood filler that almost matches, and vacuuming what felt like an entire tree worth of dust from between the boards. The pro came with the big sander, did his thing in one day, then came back twice to put down water based polyurethane in a satin finish. We kept the original color, just let the wood speak. Total cost including his labor, finish and the tool rentals we needed ended up being way less than what decent new flooring would have cost, and honestly the room looks like something from a listing now. The grain has this wavy pattern in the afternoon light and the whole space feels bigger and cleaner somehow. I keep walking past the doorway just to stare like a weirdo. So now I am side-eyeing every other carpet in the house and wondering what secrets are underneath. For other homeowners here, did you find any nice surprises under old flooring in your place, like hidden hardwood or tile that just needed some love Or was it all cracked linoleum and regrets

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a  just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

I’m trying to deploy a Vite app on Kubernetes and apparently Vite has decided environment variables are *a suggestion* and not something to actually read at runtime.

Locally? Works perfectly.  
In Kubernetes? Vite just shrugs and says “lol no” and bakes everything at build time like it’s 1998.

I’ve tried:

* ConfigMaps
* Secrets
* Direct env vars
* Sacrificing a coffee mug to the DevOps gods Nothing. Vite is like: “I already compiled. Your environment no longer concerns me.”

Do people actually rebuild their image for every environment?  
Is there some magic spell I’m missing?

But we forget because our brains aren’t good at tracking those kinds of things.

**So instead, let’s assume that we’ll forget.**

It’s not a moral issue, it doesn’t make us a bad person.  I just have 9 million things going, so I’m not going to remember to make that phone call later when they open.  

**What works better is instead systemizing habits so that I don’t even have to consider not forgetting**.  Rather than putting pressure on myself to do a thing that is a huge struggle (remembering), bypass that completely with easier actions from a realistic plan. 

Let’s start with this morning. I took the last magnesium in the bottle with my breakfast. Instead of creating a reminder for after work to get the next bottle out of back stock tonight after work, I put the empty bottle next to my water and coffee. Then, when breakfast was finished and I was heading upstairs to work, I carried the empty bottle with me and got out the new one and carried it back to the kitchen quickly.

I was very close to complete burnout and we'd got to the point where we were really questioning the future of our dynamic, so I requested a complete break in communication for a couple of days so try and focus on my wellbeing  
  
During that time, my sub posted on this subreddit about trying to maintain a healthy dynamic  but feeling afraid of losing his special place with me, and he received some really lovely and supportive responses, both via comments to his post and in his DMs. Two Dommes in particular have really helped him to see our dynamic from a different perspective - u/hatezergs you are an absolute angel and I've sent for your lunch as a thankyou. I know how respectful you were when my sub offered to send for a coffee as a thank you so it's only fair that I raise you up in return 💕 There was also another Domme who chose to remain anonymous to me (all I know is you're Canadian) but offered lots of support - my thanks also extend to you ✨.

I read so much negativity on here - Dommes tearing each other down and both sides shouting about scammers or timewasters, but this little moment just goes to show there are still people out there who genuinely want to offer help and support. As a result of the support from others, my sub and I are now in a much clearer headspace and we are both looking forward to resetting things in a more healthy and sustainable way.

For those of you who find yourself in a negative headspace as a result of your dynamic, I would strongly encourage you to have the courage to step away and look after yourself when you need to (after discussing this with your sub/Domme, of course), but also to reach out to this community for support - at the end of the day we're all just human beings trying to navigate our way through life in the best way we can.",18,1765379988.0,paypigsupportgroup,10,0.95,False
1pj586c,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pj586c/the_good_samaritan/,The Good Samaritan,"The Corolla died three miles past the last exit sign, the engine cutting out with a shudder that Claire felt in her teeth. She coasted onto the shoulder and sat there in the dark, hazards clicking, watching semis blast past and rock the car in their wake.

Her phone showed one bar. Then none. Then one again.

The tow company put her on hold before a woman with a smoker's rasp told her two hours, minimum. Maybe three. Dispatcher said there'd been a pile-up west of Barstow and they were running every truck they had.

""There's a rest stop about a mile ahead,"" the woman said. ""If you want to wait somewhere with a bathroom.""

Claire looked at the desert darkness beyond her headlights. A mile didn't sound far. A mile sounded like a death sentence.

""I'll stay with the car.""

""Suit yourself. Driver'll call when he's twenty out.""

The line went dead. Claire locked the doors and turned off the hazards to save the battery and sat in the darkness, watching her phone screen dim and brighten and dim again.

A pickup pulled onto the shoulder behind her.

She watched it in the rearview. White Ford, maybe ten years old, work lights mounted on the roof rack. It sat there for a full minute before the driver's door opened and a man stepped out.

He was mid-fifties, maybe. Thick through the shoulders. He wore a denim jacket and walked with the unhurried gait of someone who had nowhere else to be. When he reached her window, he made a little circular motion with his finger.

Claire cracked the window two inches.

""Car trouble?"" His voice was gentle. Midwestern, maybe. The kind of voice that read bedtime stories and knew all the words to church hymns.

""Tow truck's coming.""

""That's good."" He nodded, looking at her hood like he could diagnose the problem through it. ""How long they say?""

""Two hours.""

""Two hours."" He repeated it like he was tasting the words. ""That's a long time to sit on the side of the 15. You got water? Gets cold out here at night, but you'd be surprised how fast you dehydrate.""

""I'm fine.""

""Rest stop's about a mile up. Vending machines, bathroom, good overhead lighting. Safer than sitting here in the dark.""

""I'll wait with the car.""

He smiled. His teeth were very white and very straight, the kind of teeth that cost money. ""Smart. Don't trust strangers. That's smart."" He patted the roof of her car twice, gently, the way you'd pat a dog. ""You need anything, I'll be at that rest stop. White Ford. Name's Gary.""

""Thank you.""

""Don't mention it.""

He walked back to his truck. Didn't hurry. Didn't look back. The Ford pulled around her and merged onto the highway, taillights dwindling until they disappeared.

Claire realized she'd been holding her breath.

The temperature in the car dropped until she could see her breath. She started the engine to run the heater. It turned over, coughed, died. She tried again. Nothing.

She got out and started walking.

The desert was louder than she'd expected. Wind through scrub brush, the distant keen of something that might have been a coyote, the hiss of sand against her jeans. The highway was a black river to her left, cars passing in bursts of light and noise that left her more alone each time they faded.

The rest stop appeared as a glow on the horizon first, then resolved into a concrete rectangle surrounded by parking lot lights on tall poles. Two big rigs sat at the far end, dark and silent, their drivers asleep in the cabs. A sedan with Nevada plates sat near the bathroom entrance.

And the white Ford, parked directly under the brightest light.

Gary sat on a picnic bench near the vending machines, reading a paperback. He looked up when Claire entered the pool of light and smiled like she was an old friend arriving at a party.

""Decided to take me up on it.""

""Car won't start.""

""Battery, probably. Sitting with the hazards on drains them faster than people think."" He closed his book, something with an old Western cover.

""I'm fine.""

""Water, then. You look cold.""

She was cold. Her jacket was in the car. She'd walked a mile in a thin sweater because the thought of going back for it felt like admitting she'd be out here longer than she could stand.

""Okay. Water. Thank you.""

He fed quarters into the machine and retrieved a bottle, brought it to her with both hands extended like an offering. When she took it, his fingers didn't linger. He stepped back immediately, maintaining a distance that felt calculated to reassure.

""I didn't catch your name.""

""Claire.""

""Claire."" He smiled again. ""Pretty name. Old-fashioned. You don't hear it much anymore.""

""It was my grandmother's.""

""That's nice. Keeping it in the family."" He returned to the picnic bench, sitting on the table with his feet on the seat, hands folded in his lap. Patient. Unhurried. ""You call the tow company again? Let them know where you are?""

""Not yet.""

""Signal's better over by the bathrooms. Something about the building, I think. Metal in the roof blocks the interference.""

Claire walked to the bathroom entrance. Gary didn't follow. She checked her phone and found two bars, solid. The tow company picked up after three rings.

""He's still working the pile-up,"" the woman said. ""Shouldn't be too much longer. You're next on his list.""

""Can you tell him I'm at the rest stop? Mile past where my car broke down?""

""I'll let him know.""

Claire hung up. When she turned around, Gary was standing ten feet away.

""Get through?""

""Yeah. Still waiting on the pile-up.""

""Those can take a while. Depends on how bad it is, how many vehicles."" He tilted his head. ""You want to sit? Benches aren't comfortable, but they're better than standing.""

They sat at the picnic table, across from each other. Gary picked up his paperback and set it aside. The cover showed a man in a black hat pointing a revolver at something outside the frame.

""You read Westerns?"" Claire asked.

""Louis L'Amour, mostly. My father used to read them. Reminds me of him.""

""Is he still around?""

""Passed when I was thirty. Heart attack. Quick, at least.""

A semi pulled into the rest stop, air brakes hissing. The driver climbed down from the cab, a heavy man in a flannel shirt, and walked to the bathroom without looking at either of them.

Gary watched him go. ""Truckers don't sleep enough. Read an article about it once. They take pills to stay awake, drive eighteen, twenty hours at a stretch. Then they pull off and crash for a few hours and do it again. Hell of a way to make a living.""

""What do you do?""

""Contractor. Kitchens and bathrooms, mostly. Remodels."" He held up his hands, showing her the calluses. ""Good honest work. Keeps me busy.""

""You're out late for a contractor.""

""Couldn't sleep. Happens sometimes. I drive when it gets bad. Helps clear my head."" He smiled. ""You married, Claire?""

""Divorced.""

""Kids?""

""No.""

""That's probably for the best. Divorce is hard enough without kids in the middle."" He was watching the trucker's rig now, waiting. ""I've got a daughter. Lives in Portland. Works for one of those tech companies, the kind where they have ping-pong tables in the office and call their employees a family.""

""That's nice.""

""We don't talk much anymore.""

The trucker came out of the bathroom, still not looking at them, and climbed back into his cab. The engine rumbled to life. Headlights swept the parking lot as he pulled out, and then they were alone.

""You're nervous,"" Gary said. It wasn't a question.

""I'm just tired.""

""You're nervous because you're smart. Woman alone, middle of the night, stranger being friendly."" He nodded slowly. ""I tell my daughter the same thing. Trust your instincts. Be careful. The world isn't safe for women the way it's safe for men. Never has been.""

""That's good advice.""

""Is it?"" He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. ""Here's what I wonder about, Claire. What good does being careful do if the danger doesn't look like danger? If it looks like a guy in a denim jacket reading Louis L'Amour at a rest stop? If it looks like help?""

Claire didn't answer.

""My daughter,"" Gary said. ""The reason we don't talk. Her mother told her something before she died. A warning. Stay away from your father. Don't be alone with him. Don't trust him.""

""Why would she say that?""

""Because she knew me. Better than anyone ever has."" He picked up the paperback and turned it over in his hands, not looking at the cover. ""Claire, I've been doing this drive for three years now. Every few weeks, when I can't sleep. And I stop here every time. Right here at this rest stop. You know why?""

""Why?""

""Because people break down out here. All the time. Forty miles of nothing in either direction, cell service that barely works, tow trucks that take forever. And most of the time, people just wait it out. But sometimes there's a woman. Alone. Stranded. And I see her car on the shoulder, and I think to myself, she's exactly the kind of person that bad things happen to out here. Wouldn't it be something if I could help. If I could just make sure she's safe until her ride comes.""

""That's very kind.""

""No. It isn't."" He set the book down. ""Kindness would be driving past. Kindness would be minding my own business. But I can't seem to do that. I see a woman alone in the dark, and I have to stop. I have to.""

Claire's phone buzzed in her pocket. She didn't reach for it.

""You should check that,"" Gary said. ""Might be your tow truck.""

She pulled out her phone. Text from an unknown number: *En route. 20 mins.*

""He's coming,"" she said. ""Twenty minutes.""

""Good. That's good."" Gary stood up from the bench. ""Walk with me.""

""I should wait here. Where he can see me.""

""He'll find you. Walk with me. Just to the edge of the light. I want to show you something.""

They walked together toward the edge of the parking lot, where the overhead lights gave way to desert darkness. Gary stayed a half-step behind her, just in her peripheral vision. She could hear him breathing, slow and even.

""This is the spot,"" he said.

Claire stopped. The highway was visible in the distance, headlights appearing and disappearing.

""What am I looking at?""

""Nothing. That's the point. You can't see anything from here. Someone in the rest stop, they can't see us. Someone on the highway, they're going too fast to notice. We're invisible.""

Claire turned to face him. ""What do you want?""

""I want to tell you something. Something I've never told anyone."" He put his hands in his pockets, and Claire flinched before she could stop herself. He noticed. ""I'm not going to hurt you, Claire. That's not what this is. But I need you to understand what you're standing next to. What you've been sitting across from for the last hour. What you took water from.""

""Okay.""

""I've never hurt anybody. Not in the way my daughter thinks. Not in the way you're thinking right now."" He paused. ""But I've thought about it. I've thought about it more than I've thought about anything else in my life. Since I was fourteen years old, I've thought about what it would be like. The sound it would make. How it would feel in my hands. Whether they'd fight or freeze or beg. I've read about it. I've planned it. I've driven out here, to this exact spot, and I've walked women to this exact place, and I've imagined it so clearly that sometimes I can't tell the difference between what I've done and what I've only wanted to do.""

Claire's legs felt locked in place. Later, she would wonder why she didn't run. Later, she would lie awake for months turning this moment over, trying to understand the paralysis.

""Say something,"" Gary said.

""What do you want me to say?""

""I don't know. That's the thing. I've never gotten this far before. The other times, I walked them out here, and I made small talk, and I let them go, and they never knew. They got in their cars or their tow trucks and they drove away and they never thought about me again. Just a nice man at a rest stop. But tonight I wanted to say it out loud. I wanted someone to know.""

""Why me?""

""I don't know."" He smiled, and it was worse than anything else he'd done because it looked genuine. Warm. ""Maybe because you look like you'd understand. You've got that look, Claire. Like you've seen things. Like you know the world isn't what people pretend it is.""

""I don't understand this at all.""

""No. I guess you don't."" He looked at the desert, at the darkness beyond the parking lot lights. ""My wife figured it out. Took her twenty years, but she figured it out. Not what I'd done, because I haven't done anything. What I am. She could see it in me, she said. Something behind my eyes. Something that wasn't like other people. She stayed with me anyway, because she thought she could fix it, or save me, or some other thing that women tell themselves when they love someone they shouldn't love. And when she was dying, when she knew she couldn't protect anyone anymore, she told our daughter. She said, your father is a monster. He's never done anything, but he is. Stay away from him. And my daughter believed her. Because my wife wasn't a liar. My wife was the most honest person I've ever known. And if she said I was a monster, then I was.""

""Are you?""

Gary looked at her for a long time. ""I don't know. I think about it all the time, and I still don't know. What makes someone a monster? Is it what they do, or what they want to do? If I live my whole life without hurting anyone, am I still a monster because I wanted to? Because I thought about it every single day? Because the only reason I didn't was fear, not conscience?""

""I don't know either.""

""No. You don't."" He took a step toward her, and Claire stepped back, and he stopped. ""That's the first time you've moved away from me. The whole night, that's the first time. You didn't move away when I walked up to your car. You didn't move away when I brought you the water. You didn't move away when we sat at the table, when we walked out here, when I told you what I was. But now you move. Why now?""

""Because now I believe you.""

""Good."" He nodded. ""That's good. You should believe me."" He took his hands out of his pockets, slowly, showing her they were empty. ""Your tow truck's going to be here soon. You should go wait by the road.""

""What are you going to do?""

""Drive home. Go to bed. Wake up tomorrow and give an estimate on a bathroom remodel in Rancho Cucamonga."" He smiled again. ""That's the thing about people like me, Claire. We look like everybody else. We sound like everybody else. We do bathroom remodels and read Louis L'Amour and stop to help women whose cars have broken down. And most of the time nothing happens, because the circumstances aren't right, or the risk is too high, or we just decide not to. But the wanting is always there. Every single day. And you'll never be able to tell. Not until it's too late.""

He turned and walked back toward the rest stop, hands in his pockets, unhurried. Claire watched him until he reached his truck. He got in, started the engine, and pulled out onto the highway heading east. Toward Victorville. Toward a house where he lived alone.

She stood at the edge of the parking lot until headlights slowed on the highway and the yellow flash of a tow truck's light bar appeared. The driver pulled into the rest stop and leaned out the window. Young guy, early twenties, apologetic about the wait.

""Hell of a night,"" he said. ""You okay? You look like you saw a ghost.""

Claire climbed into the passenger seat. Closed the door. Locked it.

""Just cold,"" she said. ""Long wait.""

He talked the whole way back to her car. The pile-up near Barstow, the overtime, his girlfriend who didn't understand why he worked nights. Claire didn't hear any of it. She was thinking about Portland. About a daughter who believed her mother's warning. About a wife who stayed with a monster for twenty years because she thought she could save him.

The Corolla's battery was dead, just like Gary had said. The driver jumped it in five minutes, and Claire sat behind the wheel as the engine idled, waiting for the charge to build.

""You good to drive?""

""I'm good.""

""Nearest gas station's about twenty miles. Get yourself some coffee.""

""I will.""

She pulled onto the highway and drove east, toward the glow of Las Vegas on the horizon. In her rearview, the rest stop shrank to a single point of light in all that darkness, and then it was nothing at all.

She never told anyone about Gary. Not the police, not her friends, not the therapist she started seeing six months later for anxiety she couldn't explain. What would she say? A man talked to her. A man gave her water. A man walked her to the edge of the light and told her what he was and then drove home to sleep in his bed like any other person.

Nothing happened.

That was the worst part. Nothing happened, and she couldn't prove anything, and somewhere in Victorville a man with a gentle voice was lying awake in the dark, thinking about the sound it would make. The way it would feel. Whether they'd fight or freeze or beg.

And Claire would never know if tonight was the night he stopped imagining.

Or tomorrow night.

Or the night after that.

I live in the Netherlands and I'm an engineer with a physics background. I mostly keep busy with powerlifting, reading, working with my hands, letting my creativity out in various ways (home DIY, lego, modelbuilding, 3d printing/design), cooking, gaming, tv shows and movies, scifi and fantasy, anything educational or scientific, and a whole lot of music (mostly rock, metalcore, and drum&bass). Total neurodivergent nerd.

I'd love to go for a coffee at your favorite cozy coffee spot, or be shown a not-so-well-known bookstore. Maybe we do a workout together. Or maybe you just want to give me a recommendation to check out myself.

1pj55va,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMoreCustomers/comments/1pj55va/the_ultimate_trust_test_to_know_if_your_store_is/,The Ultimate Trust Test To Know If Your Store Is Probably Failing,"Your visitor just landed on your product page. In three seconds, they’ll decide if you’re legit or sketchy.

Whether you have made a store with Shopify, Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace or any e-commerce platform and then you see there are no sales even with steady traffic or having many abandoned carts - then you’re facing a serious conversion problem. Here’s what kills trust instantly and the dead-simple fixes that actually convert:

1. Your Product Photos Look Like Stock Images.
The problem: Perfect white backgrounds, generic angles, zero personality. Visitors can’t tell if you actually have the product or you’re dropshipping from AliExpress.
The fix: Add ONE photo that’s clearly yours. Show the product in your hands, on your desk, next to your coffee mug. Imperfect is authentic. Authentic converts.

2. You’re Hiding Your Face.
The problem: No about page, no photos, just “we” and “our team.” You sound like a corporation. Or worse - a scam.
The fix: Put a real photo of yourself somewhere visible. Even better? A 10-second video saying “Hey, I’m Sarah, I started this because…” People buy from people, not websites.

3. Your “Benefits” Are Just Features in Disguise.
The problem: “Made with premium stainless steel!” Cool. Why should I care?
The fix: Translate every feature into what it MEANS for them.
> Not “Stainless steel” → “Won’t rust, even if you leave it in the sink for three days”

> Not “1080p camera” → “Your Zoom calls won’t look like a potato”

> Not “Organic cotton” → “Soft enough to sleep in, tough enough to actually wear”

4. You’re Blind to Your Own Trust Gaps.
The problem: You’ve stared at your site for so long, you can’t see what’s missing. No security badges? Broken links on mobile? Generic footer that screams “template”? These trust signals are invisible to you but glaring to customers.
The fix: Run your site through ScanCX. It scans your entire store and points out exactly which trust signals are missing - the ones making visitors bounce before they buy. Think of it as a conversion audit that takes less than 60 seconds instead of hiring a consultant for $5,000.

5. Your Urgency Tactics Are Obvious Lies.
The problem: “Only 2 left!” (Refreshes page) “Only 2 left!” (Again tomorrow) “Only 2 left!”
The fix: Real urgency or none at all. If you have 50 units, just say “Low stock on this color.” Or skip the countdown entirely and focus on why they should buy NOW - not because fake scarcity, but because it solves their problem today.

6. Your Checkout Has Surprise Costs.
The problem: Product shows $29. Cart shows $29. Checkout suddenly shows $47 with shipping and “handling fees”
The fix: Show total cost EARLY. “Free shipping over $50” on every page. Or bake shipping into your price. Cart abandonment drops when there are zero surprises.

The Difference-Maker:
Conversion isn’t about growth hacks. It’s about removing friction and adding trust.

Pick ONE thing from this list. Fix it today. Not tomorrow, today. Your conversion rate is just the percentage of people who believe you’re worth the risk. Make it less risky.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1765379828.0,GetMoreCustomers,0,1.0,False

I had a conference in Singapore with three connecting flights. Chicago to Los Angeles. Los Angeles to Tokyo. Tokyo to Singapore. Twenty-three hours of total travel time. And naturally everything that could go wrong did.

My first flight got delayed. Which made me miss my connection. Which meant scrambling to get rebooked. Which meant my checked bag ended up somewhere in the Pacific while I ended up at a hotel near LAX at midnight with nothing but my cabin luggage.

Thank God for that cabin luggage. I'd packed it smart. Change of clothes. Toiletries. Phone chargers. My laptop and all my conference materials. Medication. Even a small towel because you never know. While everyone else at the airline counter was panicking about their checked bags I just shrugged and went to find coffee.

The next morning I made my rebooked flight. I arrived in Singapore twelve hours later than planned but with everything I actually needed. My presentation went fine. My clients never knew the chaos. And I learned that packing light isn't about having less. It's about having exactly what matters.

That bag came with me on every trip after that. It forced me to think about what I really needed versus what I thought I might need. Turns out you need a lot less than you think. I'd bought it years ago during a random shopping session on Alibaba and it became my most valued travel companion. Sometimes the practical purchases are the ones that matter most.""

Hey! I’m posting this in the middle of my end-sems (they get over in a week, thank god), so if nothing else, this should tell you I’m both lonely and an absolute nerd. I’ve been buried in notes, case laws, and coffee for days now, and even though college is exciting, it’s also been a bit overwhelming not having people I really connect with yet.

I’d love to meet people who are kind, thoughtful, and open to real conversations the kind where we actually get to know each other, not just exchange dry “hey/hi”s. And who knows, if we connect well, maybe something deeper could grow from it… but no pressure. I’m big on letting things unfold naturally.

A little about me: I’m a law student, so yes, most of my life right now is reading, researching, writing, and pretending I understand everything on the first read (I don’t). Outside academics, I’m obsessed with literature romance, thrillers, anything that makes me feel something or makes my brain spin a little. I love history, psychology, feminism, philosophy, and just understanding why people are the way they are. I love learning through conversations as much as I do through books.

Personality-wise, I’m an ambivert quiet at first, but once I’m comfortable, I get warm, chatty, and very “I remember the tiny details you told me three days ago.” I’m a feminist but also a hopeless romantic. I love independence, but I also love soft, intentional care. Little things matter to me a lot.

I’ve never dated before, mostly because I want something real. I’m not into casual anything. I want friendship first something steady, warm, intentional, and actually meaningful. I’m a “date to marry” person, but I also don’t rush into things. I like slow, genuine connection.

And just to be clear: I don’t reply to one-word intros. If you message me, tell me something about yourself maybe what you’re reading, what your week has been like, what’s been on your mind lately, something real. I want to know you, not just “hey.”

If you’ve read this far, I’d genuinely love to hear from you just maybe forgive me if I reply with a slight delay. End-sems have me hostage right now.

I was sitting at my desk on a Wednesday afternoon drowning in spreadsheets when that question hit me hard. When I was ten I wanted to be a marine biologist. I wanted to spend every day on the water studying ocean life and feeling the sun on my face.

Instead I was in a cubicle under fluorescent lights calculating quarterly projections. Thirty-two years old and I couldn't remember the last time I'd even been on a boat. That thought sat with me for weeks. It made my coffee taste bitter. It made my commute feel longer.

Then one Saturday I did something impulsive. I researched what it would actually take to spend more time on the water. Could I afford it? Where would I even start? I found myself looking at electric boats online. They were quieter than regular ones. Better for actually observing wildlife. More environmentally friendly too.

I didn't buy one that day. But I did start volunteering at the aquarium on weekends. I took a boating safety course. I began saving money in an account I labeled dreams instead of retirement. Sometimes asking yourself the hard questions is the first step to answering them. The research started late one night on Alibaba of all places but it led somewhere real. Somewhere closer to that ten-year-old who loved the ocean.

When I got home, I found out that **the same thing happened to my mother, father, and disabled brother** — all four of our accounts were deactivated on the same day.

I called customer service, and they said they would escalate it to a “specialist,” but they also repeated that the accounts were closed for violating the Terms of Service. None of us have any idea what violation they’re referring to.

What makes this even more aggravating is that **each of us had our own amount of money loaded onto our accounts**, and now we can’t log in at all. It appears as though the balances have just disappeared.

The timing is also suspicious. We were all having login issues during the *Starbucks for Life* marathon event, and I had been in contact with Starbucks via Instagram about the problem. Then—**within a few hours**—we all received nearly identical account-closure emails.

We all live at the same address but have **our own driver’s licenses/IDs, birthdays, and individual Starbucks accounts**. The only thing we share is our home address. Are they assuming it’s one person using multiple accounts? Is this some automated mass-flagging?

Keeping them that way is easier than it seems — just a few simple habits.  
  
1. Dust once a week (your future self will thank you).  
  
A quick weekly dust keeps buildup from turning into stubborn grime. Use a microfiber cloth, a static duster, or a vacuum on low with a soft-brush attachment. Start at the top, glide to the bottom, and you’re done.  
Less dust = happier fabric + happier air quality.  
  
2. Spot-clean stains ASAP.  
  
Life happens — coffee, fingerprints, mystery splashes ☕️.  
For fresh stains, dab (don’t rub) with a soft damp cloth + a drop of mild dish soap. Test in a hidden spot first and always let it air-dry. No heat, no soaking.  
  
3. Keep moisture + grease at arm’s length.  
  
Zebra fabrics don’t love humidity or airborne grease. If yours are in a kitchen or bathroom, good ventilation helps — think exhaust fan or cracked window. Protecting the fabric now saves cleaning later.  
  
4. Treat spills like mini emergencies.  
  
Even tiny splashes matter. Keep a microfiber cloth nearby so you can blot the moment it happens. Quick action = way better results ✨.  
  
5. Do a quick check-in every month or so.  
  
A 60-second inspection goes far:  
  
Are the panels aligning?  
  
Any loose threads?  
  
Does the mechanism glide smoothly?  
Catching issues early keeps everything running effortlessly.  
  
6. Deep-clean occasionally.  
  
A mild soap + water solution is all you need for a deeper refresh. Blot gently, never soak. Avoid harsh chemicals — they can weaken adhesives or discolor the fabric.  
  
7. Protect from strong sun exposure.  
  
Prolonged UV can fade fabric. Adjust shade positions during peak sun or use a sheer layer or window film to soften exposure ☀️.  
  
The short version:  
  
Dust often. Blot gently. Avoid moisture. Do small check-ins. Use mild soap. Protect from heavy sun.  
A little consistency keeps your zebra shades looking crisp and glowing for years.  
  
If yours are already up, you're ahead of the game — this routine just helps them stay beautiful. And if you’re choosing new shades, we’re all about helping light work for you, not against you 😉.",1,1765379434.0,u_selectblinds,0,1.0,False

I am pretty in touch with my health. I am active, watch my nutrition for the most part, and occasionally take breaks from alcohol, marijuana (edibles), and caffeine. I decided to cut marijuana out indefinitely because the cons for me were outweighing the pros. I do not miss it at all, so that currently isn’t a concern of mine, I just wanted to paint a picture. I took a 3-month break from alcohol that started in August, followed by a 2-month break from caffeine starting in September. It’s the holiday season, and I have many loved ones visiting that like to go out for drinks. I decided that a couple or few nights of responsible drinking scattered throughout this holiday season wouldn’t be too detrimental to my overall health, so I gave it a shot Thanksgiving Eve. TERRIBLE hangover followed that I was paying for days after. Lightheadedness, significant fatigue, weakened performance in the gym/cardio sessions, etc. I took it easy to recover, but this past Saturday, I went out to the bars with my sister and our friends to celebrate her graduation. Same thing happened. I properly hydrate and take electrolytes to prepare and recover from a night out, eat a healthy amount of satiating foods prior to drinking, and refuse to drink two or more days in a row. It just seems that my body no longer tolerates any alcohol. This leads to my question; can abstaining from alcohol cause your body to build an intolerance to it?

Same thing for caffeine. I took the break because I realized my tolerance was getting a bit high, causing my intake to increase, inching closer to the limit of recommended intake. The withdrawal process was grueling, but I made it through. I was doing fine without caffeine for the weeks after, but I tried to introduce it after the nights of drinking (with black tea so my caffeine intake didn’t make a significant jump), slowly working my way up to one cup of coffee after breakfast. I have noticed that my heart health rating on my Garmin watch has decreased and I have been experiencing heart palpitations frequently throughout the day (the single strong heartbeat, the one that feeling like a thump in your diaphragm). This leads into my next question; can the body grow an intolerance for caffeine after a period of abstinence?

p.s. I am willing to cut these things out for the foreseeable future. I thankfully do not have an addiction, nor do I feel like they are a necessity to get through the day or have a good time during a night out. As I stated before, I am pretty in touch with my body, so I just wanted to gather more information on the why behind my body responding to a reintroduction of these things so I have a better understanding!

What to Know Before You Commit,"Hey everyone — if you’re thinking about using marble for your kitchen remodel, you’re not alone. Marble has this timeless elegance that can make a kitchen feel upscale and classic. But before you get swept away by the beauty of veining and polish, it’s worth understanding what it really means to live with marble — especially in a Louisiana home. Here’s a breakdown of what works, what to watch out for, and how to make marble a smart (or informed) choice.

[American Marble and Granite](https://preview.redd.it/drxkjj0p6e6g1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5618ee3e9069388ecd497ac591a54b0d14e8209d)

# ✨ Why Marble Is So Appealing for Kitchens

* **Classic & Luxurious Aesthetic.** Marble brings a natural, elegant look with unique veining and color variations — every slab is one-of-a-kind. It works beautifully in traditional, modern, or transitional kitchen styles. 
* **Cool Surface Ideal for Baking & Prep.** Because marble tends to stay cooler than room temperature, it’s a favorite for bakers and people who do a lot of prep work — rolling dough, kneading, working with chocolate or pastry. 
* **Potential Home Value & Timeless Feel.** Marble is often seen as a premium material — for those seeking a high-end kitchen, it can give a sense of permanence and style that endures beyond trends. 

# ⚠️ What to Consider — Challenges of Marble (Especially in Louisiana)

* **Porous & Prone to Stains / Acid Sensitivity.** Marble can absorb liquids — wine, coffee, oils, sauces — especially if spills sit too long. Even acidic foods (like citrus or tomato sauce) can etch or dull the surface. [c](https://countertopscontractors.com/the-stone-magazine/design-trends/marble-countertops-are-they-a-good-choice-for-kitchens-pros-and-cons-explained/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Softness ⇒ Scratches, Etching & Chips.** Compared to granite or quartz, marble is softer. Cutting, sliding heavy cookware, or even just regular heavy use can lead to scratches, chips, or wear over time. 
* **Maintenance Requirements.** Marble countertops need regular sealing, careful cleaning with pH-neutral products, and quick cleanup of spills to help avoid permanent damage. For a busy kitchen, that means staying on top of upkeep. 
* **Heat & Wear Considerations.** Marble handles some heat fine, but placing very hot pots or pans directly can still be risky — using trivets or hot pads is a smart habit. Over time, heavy use may dull or damage the finish. 



# 🛠️ If You Choose Marble — Tips for a More Functional & Enduring Marble Kitchen

If you love the look of marble and want to use it in your kitchen, these strategies help you get the most out of it:

* **Seal Upon Installation & Reseal Regularly.** A quality sealant is your first line of defense against staining — make sealing part of your kitchen maintenance routine.
* **Use Cutting Boards, Trivets, and Soft Cleaners.** Avoid cutting directly on marble, don’t place hot cookware directly on it, and clean with pH-neutral or stone-safe cleaners only.
* **Be Mindful of Spills & Acidic Items.** Wipe up spills immediately (especially wine, oil, acidic juices or sauces) to reduce the risk of permanent marks.
* **Balance Marble With Other Materials.** Maybe use marble where you want beauty (islands, accent counters, baker’s prep zones) — and more hardened materials elsewhere if you expect heavy wear or frequent cooking.
* **Accept That Marble Ages — Sometimes Gracefully.** Over time, marble may develop a patina, small etches or character that some homeowners like — but you should go in with realistic expectations.

# 💬 We Want to Hear From You — Share Your Thoughts & Experiences

* Are you considering marble for your kitchen? What draws you to it?
* Have you had marble in a home — how did it hold up under regular cooking, kids, pets, or heavy use?
* Did you use a honed finish, polished, or another option — what difference did it make?
* What habits or maintenance routines helped keep your marble looking good (or not)?

I looked on Reddit about how you should start with half a scope to build a little tolerance to make it enjoyable and how people who didn’t were vomiting and feeling dizzy (so I didn’t listen of course 😇) I took the whole scoop and it was a weird feeling. I went home and sat in bed for 2 hours trying to fall asleep my heart was beating fast which is something you expect on pre-workout. But what wasn’t normal was after 4 hours or so (I took the pre-workout for a gym sesh right before bed) I was finally feeling tired but I had chest pain, nothing crazy but definitely there. And woke up hours later (right now) and I feel chest tightness/pain still. Help? (Also side note I took a coffee earlier that day for homework that was about 110mg of caffeine, idk if that matters or not)

Obviously I did everything to remove the smell; I sprayed whatever good-smelling liquid I had in my bag, but I was attending a workshop, so I didn’t have any perfume or mist with me. 

Anyway, I left the event and reached the office — still smelling like I bathed in bad coffee — and thankfully, I have a body mist in my office drawer. The story doesn’t end there though. 

I sprayed too much mist, so now I’m getting a really bad headache because of the strong smell, lmao. 

And now the bizarre twist — you know how in perfume stores they have those small boxes of coffee beans? Coffee beans do help with resetting your sense of smell, not literally but it does help! 

So anyway I ran to the kitchen and sniffed the frick out of whatever coffee powder we have in the office. 

I don’t know why I had to write a novel out of this funny situation. I just found it bizarre and honestly I have way too much time right now, lol.

But you get my point, right? I hated the smell of coffee so I used a body mist. And then I hated the smell of the body mist so I had to use coffee again.. what a bizarre world we live in.

I'd worked at the marketing firm for four years. My friend got hired two years ago and I actually recommended her. She was struggling after her divorce and I wanted to help. We'd grab lunch every day, vent about our boss, share campaign ideas over coffee. I trusted her completely.

The promotion opened up in March. Senior creative director. I'd been preparing for months, staying late to polish my portfolio, building client relationships. My boss kept hinting it was mine. ""You've earned this,"" he said after I landed the Cascade Electronics account. I was so sure.

Then HR called me in.

""We've received some concerns about your reliability,"" the woman said. She had this sympathetic look that made my stomach drop. ""Multiple missed deadlines. Conflicts with team members. We need someone more stable for senior leadership.""

I sat there stunned. ""What missed deadlines? I've never—""

""We have documentation."" She slid a folder across. ""We're giving the position to someone else.""

My friend got announced as senior creative director that afternoon.

She found me at my desk after. ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry you didn't get it. You must be devastated."" Her hand on my shoulder felt like a brand. ""But hey, you'll get the next one.""

I looked up at her. She was wearing the blazer I'd helped her pick out for her interview. ""Congrats,"" I said. My voice sounded far away. ""You deserve it.""

I went home and cried for three hours. Then I got angry.

I requested my HR file through official channels. Took two weeks but I got it. The ""documentation"" was emails. From her. Saying I'd missed deadlines on projects we'd collaborated on. Saying I'd made inappropriate comments about clients. Saying I'd been unstable and emotional at work. All lies. All carefully worded to sound concerned rather than malicious.

She'd stabbed me in the back and I'd smiled and congratulated her.

I thought about confronting her. Thought about going to HR. But she'd covered her tracks perfectly. It would look like sour grapes from the person who didn't get promoted. So I did nothing.

Except.

Two months ago, I'd let her borrow my old work laptop when hers was getting repaired. ""Just for the weekend,"" she'd said. I'd wiped it but left some old project files she said she wanted to reference. What I didn't mention was the tracking software I'd installed before handing it over. Completely legal, my device, my software. I just wanted to see what she was doing.

She'd copied everything. My entire portfolio. Campaigns I'd developed. Presentations I'd built. Strategy documents I'd written. All of it.

I watched her use my work for three weeks. Small stuff at first. Then bigger. She presented ""her"" social media strategy for a new client and I recognized every single slide. My graphics. My data. My words.

Her big presentation was scheduled for the board meeting on Friday. New business pitch for a massive pharmaceutical account. Multi-million dollar contract. She'd been bragging about it for days, how this would cement her position, how the board was going to love her vision.

I'd seen the presentation. She'd built it entirely from my files.

Thursday night, I modified the tracking software. Added a little extra feature. When she opened the presentation file, it would display a full audit trail. Every file she'd accessed from my laptop. Every document she'd copied. Every timestamp. Overlaid right on top of her slides.

I didn't sleep that night.

Friday morning, the board meeting started at nine. I wasn't invited, obviously. I sat at my desk pretending to work.

My phone buzzed at 9:47. My former boss. ""Conference room. Now.""

The board was still assembled when I walked in. Eight people in expensive suits looking grim. My friend was standing at the front, face completely white. The projection screen behind her showed her presentation, but covered in red text. File paths. Copy dates. My name all over everything.

""Is this your work?"" one of the board members asked me.

I looked at the screen. ""Yes.""

""All of it?""

""Every campaign. Every strategy. Every graphic."" I kept my voice steady. ""I developed all of that over the past two years.""

My friend tried. ""She's lying, I can explain, we collaborated—""

""The metadata doesn't lie,"" the IT director said. He looked disgusted. ""These files were copied from her device to yours. You didn't just use them as reference. You presented them as original work.""

The meeting lasted thirty minutes. She cried. She begged. She said I'd given her permission, that it was a misunderstanding, that I was sabotaging her out of jealousy.

The board didn't care.

They fired her on the spot. Walked her out with security. She screamed at me in the hallway. ""You petty bitch, you ruined my life over a job!""

""You ruined my career with lies,"" I said. ""I just showed them who you really are.""

HR called me back two days later. They'd reviewed everything. The false reports. The plagiarism. They offered me the senior director position with back pay and a formal apology.

I took it.

My friend has called me seventeen times. Left voicemails calling me vindictive, saying I went too far, that she has kids to support and now she can't get hired anywhere because word spread in our industry. My mom says I should have just confronted her privately instead of humiliating her publicly. That I destroyed her on purpose when I could have been the bigger person.

But she destroyed me first. She lied to get ahead and stole my work to stay there. I just made sure the truth came out.

Was I wrong for the way I did it?

I have carried this habit forever despite not being involved in business anymore. Recently I joined a training that will be helpful for my career. It will be for 4 months. There are people who have come alone like me and people who have joined with co-workers or friends too. One of these guys joined with his co-worker, but it looks like they have become friends because of this training. The training has been already going on for almost 2 months. I have also become friendly with these guys. 

Because of my habit of wanting to know more about people I am in regular contact with, I did some social media digging of these guys and one of them is married. This made it more comfortable to me because both the other guy and me are in long term, happy, committed relationships. So I feel really comfortable with them. However, the topic about relationship very rarely (almost never) comes up because it is an intensive course and we only really talk about the course material and class. 

Recently the married guy was absent and the other guy tells me 'Don't you see that he is trying to flirt with you?' and gives me specific examples. I was like 'What are you talking about? Isn't he married? Why would he do that?' He was like 'Nah, what are you talking about? He is single, he has been single as long as I have known him'. I didn't want to be like 'No, I have stalked you in social media, so i know', so I just said that I am in a relationship and not open to flirting or anything like that. But this guy seems to genuinely not know that the married guy is in fact married. You can just scroll his facebook and he has many pictures with his wife all over his facebook. 

Things went back to normal the next day when the other guy came back to class. But it was more like the course got even more intense, so we haven't talked about anything other than  coursework, not even like hellos or how are yous, etc. Today was a rare lighter day in the usually intense class and the other guy wasn't there, so it was just me and the married guy and he was talking like usual and also said some stuff what the other guy called flirting. I never took it as flirting. But today I kind of felt uncomfortable because the other guy had said it was actually flirting and not normal conversation between friends. For example grabbing coffee after class, like a lot of people grab coffee with other classmates after the class. These two guys do it too, I never took part in it because I don't drink coffee.

I looked on Reddit about how you should start with half a scope to build a little tolerance to make it enjoyable and how people who didn’t were vomiting and feeling dizzy (so I didn’t listen of course 😇) I took the whole scoop and it was a weird feeling. I went home and sat in bed for 2 hours trying to fall asleep my heart was beating fast which is something you expect on pre-workout. But what wasn’t normal was after 4 hours or so (I took the pre-workout for a gym sesh right before bed) I was finally feeling tired but I had chest pain, nothing crazy but definitely there. And woke up hours later (right now) and I feel chest tightness/pain still. Help? (Also side note I took a coffee earlier that day for homework that was about 110mg of caffeine, idk if that matters or not)

I was able to see my son and be in the moment due to not drinking.

I accidentally sent you a message request on Spotify. When I clicked your name, sabi kasi dun may message request daw and I *may or may have not* accidentally clicked “Accept.” I deleted our history of shared songs sa Spotify out of panic and shame. And wala din naman nacreate na new convo so I guess you rejected the request. Haha. Silly me. Pero seryoso akala ko lang talaga meron request from you kaya napa-click ako. Wala eh, umasa ako. Haha.

I’m talking to this guy and I told him na I’ll be working at a coffee shop tonight. I remembered you. Namiss tuloy kita lalo. Kasi you used to say na sasamahan mo ako, na kahit di kita pansinin or di tayo masyadong mag-usap. You’d say na magdadala ka ng book mo at magbabasa ka lang beside me. You’d say *”I won’t bother you, promise! Gusto lang talaga kita makasama.”* kaya siguro working outside (or just going to the coffee shop we used to go to) hits different now.

Just a month ago today, dumaan ka sa bahay after gym and you just hugged and kissed me. That was what, 10-15 mins lang siguro yun. Super quick lang. Sabi mo gusto mo lang talaga ako makita. And then I heard you mutter under your breath, *”Worth it!”* 

I feel pathetic for still thinking about you. I was lovebombed. You ghosted me. I’m still devastated. I don’t know until when ako ganito. All I know is that I just miss you so much. ~~di ka na ba talaga babalik?~~

I've been in a relationship for a year, and about a few monthes ago we officially moved in together. That's when everything started to go downhill.

On the night we signed the lease, I found out that for part of our relationship he had been using drugs, although he said he quit. It suddenly explained so many things about his behavior back then, but it also made him feel like a completely different person to me.

To me it felt like a betrayal. While I was sick and asking him to come over, he told me he was ""busy."" He couldn't find money to buy me a birthday present. All of that suddenly made sense once I learned the truth.

Then we started living together. I paid the entire deposit for the apartment. Because of the move, his unemployment benefits were put on hold, and he started looking for work. Two months passed.

He got a temporary job, but he was fired after a 5-day trial period. During that time, he constantly yelled at me, snapped at me, and said he was ""exhausted."" Every morning I woke up earlier than him, packed food for both of us, made breakfast, and cooked dinner after work. He never thanked me even once.

After he was fired, he acted the same, but blamed it on the ""stress from losing his job."" Now I'm the one working, paying for both of us and the apartment. I cook, I clean. And he still gets angry at me, saying he's tired too and that I ""don't do enough."" He says I earn too little to support us properly, so he doesn't see the point of ""being a househusband."" He throws tantrums. He'll throw my favorite coffee mug across the kitchen, or hit the wall until a chunk of plaster falls off.

Today we went to take care of some documents.

While I spoke with the employee, he played Clash Royale on his phone and didn't participate at all.

After we left, I asked him to help me carry my scarf. We were talking, and he started saying that I always leave my things everywhere, so if he ever breaks something, it won't be his fault. When I responded, he threw my scarf into a puddle, took the keys, and walked away.

I called him. He told me to go home and get the keys myself ""if they're so important."" I was terrified he would hurt the dog or break something, so I went back. We haven't spoken since.

Right now, I can't evict him because the lease is in both of our names and we are both registered at the address. I'm just waiting for the contract to end or for some chance to move out...

I don't want to say directly that I want to break up. I think after today he already understands. I don't see a future with him. I'm not going to marry him or have children with him. I don't want to spend my future next to this person. But for now, I don't have another option.

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I moved in together a few monthes ago, and everything has gone downhill. He used drugs earlier in our relationship, hides things, yells at me, breaks my things, refuses to work, and makes me financially support both of us while blaming me for ""not doing enough."" I can't evict him because the lease is in both of our names. I don't see a future with him, but I currently have no way to leave.",14,1765378333.0,TrueOffMyChest,16,0.9,False

My husband got paid and while we were getting dressed I asked him to send me money for breakfast/coffee and he told me yes, but didn't send the money right away, about 10 minutes later before he left the house I reminded him and asked him not to forget to send the money, and he assured me he wouldn't. I go about my regular schedule and about 45 minutes have passed since I asked and I just finished dropping off my youngest at daycare. The dunkin is right next to her daycare, and there isn't another one closer to my job, so after I drop her off I need to put in the order right away & I specifically did not make myself breakfast because my husband said he would send me money for breakfast.

Anyways I hadn't received the money so I called my husband, and he ignored my phone call. Which admittedly sent me into a fit of rage where the following conversation took place:

Me: You really Piss me off

Me: I'm done

Me: From now on we split bills 50/50 and your money is your money and my money is mine. You don't have any money left over, or you don't have enough to pay your half of the bills that's too fucking bad, figure it out.

(I make twice as much as him but, we combine income, pay all bills and split the remainder 50/50 so its fair. But he gets paid a day before me)

Me: You did this shit on purpose and I will not forgive you. I'm going to keep holding this grudge.

Him: \*calls me\*

Me:\*ignores phone call\*

Me: I don't want to fucking talk to you

Him: I am sorry I got super busy!!!

Me: Shut up

Me: That is a really shitty excuse when I asked you twice before you even left the house.

Him: You have no right to talk to me like that

Him. I'm don't. I simply forgot! Fuck you.

Me: You didn't

Me: You did it on purpose

Me: Fuck you

Me: Why didn't you just send it when I asked

Him: why the fuck would I do it on purpose!?

Me: It would have avoided this whole thig

Me: I specifically asked you not to forget

Me: Because you didn't want to send it to me!!!

Me: If you ""forget"" until its too late, then you wouldn't have to send it.

Him: \*sends money\*

Me: ITS TOO LATE

at this point I was already at work and will have to suffer through the day with no caffeine. \*\*we have a newborn that I am up with all night, before having to work 10 hour days\*\*

This is not the first time he has ""forgotten"" to send me money in the morning, and while I do think I went too far. I also think he is the asshole because he should have just sent it when I asked him, before he got busy. Especially because he had his phone right there in his hand when I asked, but for some reason he just didn't, and he thought it would be a better idea to wait? Him ignoring my phone call is what really sent me over the edge, from my perspective he was trying to avoid me, and sending me the money. If I would have known he didn't want to send it to me, I would have just made my own breakfast before leaving the house. Anyways am I the asshole""?",0,1765378260.0,AITAH,28,0.23,False

I got a sponsored ad for them yesterday and had a nosy little look through their website and boy oh boy, I’d say avoid. 


1) The ad was targeting students and talked about how we’re close to campus and how you can get a coffee at your favourite nearby cafe. Tim Horton’s is a 25 minute walk if that’s what they mean. UofW is also probably a 25 minute bike ride away.


2) they completely made up an intersection! They say there is a bus stop nearby at Coldstream and Bridge. Bridge is no where near this area and we don’t have bus stops close by. The nearest one is a few blocks away and certainly not on coldstream. This is a heavily car dependant area. We’re on the edge of the city in a suburb. There are no conveniences without a car.


3) they describe the neighbourhood as ‘vibrant’ and talk about how high end restaurants and bars are a ‘stones throw away’. Again, we’re very much a suburb with nothing in it haha. State and Main is a 30 minute walk if that’s what they’re saying is a high end restaurant/bar?!


4) My personal opinion: these units are way uglier than I expected and do not reflect the price tag. 


I just don’t know who they made these for. The appearance of the units screams shitty student apartment, but a one bedroom is $2k a month and there are no amenities in the building or nearby.

Previous history posts, and feel free to message me questions or just drop a comment. 

This isn’t your typical speed fate event. First this is a three hour event, starting the night off with a happy hour at 6pm. Great for those that want to start their weekend with great drink deals and socialize with others while scoping out our interactive activities before the main event. 

Right at 7pm we open the doors for our Speed Date show, this is a ticketed event and spectating is always welcomed while audience participation is highly encouraged. Enjoy a fun, unexpected and hilarious hour as we randomly select two strangers to hit the stage on a quick first date as Cupid and our Co-Host for the night ask each one questions really getting as much out of them as possible. While also giving the chance for the audience to ask questions and even an opportunity to steal the date! This is a fun way for people to learn about someone either if you’re on the stage or off. Don’t worry each date is super quick and you’ll be wanting to do it over again. 

Finally we cap the night off by opening the floor to our Mix and Mingle. This is a free hour where you can meet those you saw on stage and shoot your shot, or just socialize with locals and enjoy listening to their lives, sharing experiences together. 

I typically host this show but gave birth to my first baby back in October, so we have a new Cupid running the show and from what I hear, last month had the audience craving for more! 

Grab tickets on eventbrite by searching Match Made, or just drop a comment if you’d like me to provide a direct link (I don’t want Reddit mods to flag my post). 

Age range varies but I’d say average is 30-40. Again spectating is always welcomed so even if you’re in the fence, come enjoy a good laugh on a Friday night and if you see what you like you can sign up to participate anytime during the show!

It’s the constant stares and weird energy and I just get the chills. I love to dress up, wear makeup, and look good but at the expense of being a target of attention? I’m not wearing anything revealing btw. 

I look through pages/photos to see the demographic of people already at said social groups and determine that some may be interested in me, and IM ALWAYS RIGHT. I always have people following up with me afterwards to get a coffee, or just nonstop staring throughout said social event. It makes me want to crawl out of my skin.

The problem is is this is stopping me from joining sports and other social groups.

I’ve read lots of threads online on how I have to be assertive that I’m not interested, but I’m there to socialize and build community?? 

I either stare with a deer in headlights look and ignore men when they’re super interested in me, or because I’m generally friendly, bubbly, outgoing, and easy to speak to, I converse with them and everyone (because I’m there to build connection and *community*)

I have been recently diagnosed with ""Severe"" Combined ADHD (interventive & Hyperactive).

**Grief / My Reaction:**

I see many people felt ""relieved"" when they had their diagnosis as it confirmed why they were way they were throughout their lives .. However, i felt like i have known all my life, my people around me knew.. So when i got my diagnosis last Weekend, it felt like

""FINALLY I can say i have ADHD and not feel like a con.. because i have had a professional confirm it"" I also felt grief for my younger self. The way she struggled all the way through, thinking she was the total problem when really it was peoples lack of understanding.

Like i feel like i am at a stage where i want to now figure out who i am... and grieving..

Did anyone else experience that??

**Medication Fears:**

There is a fear of medication in this too. My Physiatrist said to me ""You need to take Elvance daily to heal from your mind. it will quieten it..""  
This sounds like a dream boat to me, and i defiantly want that however, the side effects i see people experience on these meds, it brings out terrible fear.

I suffer with panic attacks, and i have trouble sleeping most days.. and i have finally got into a nice sleep hygiene... I dont want this tablet to mess it all up because its taken me WEEKS to finally feel that peace with sleep again..

**Me, and My ADHD, Living with partner:**

Since moving out with a partner who doesn't clean the house (or pick up his things), i find myself naturally cleaning? It has almost become therapeutic for me.. Don't get me wrong, there are so many days where i just want to live my ADHD self, and not clean.. however i feel this god awful guilt of

**""We have been home all Saturday, he doesn't deserve to live in a shithole...""**

So i guess i've kinda' trained my head to find cleaning therapeutic.. It helps me release hyperactivity..  
I just wack on a pair of headphones, with the right music and off i go to ""focus"" on cleaning our home.. Although i divver off doing random tasks whilst trying to do one thing at a time.. I would clean the kitchen, find something and go ""OOOO I need to clean the bathroom window.."" so i leave the kitchen half done.. focus on the bathroom window.. walk into the kitchen for something then go ""Oooooohh f&ck i didn't finish the sink.."" then i left the damn bathroom tap running..

If anyone saw how i am, they wouldn't think i suffer truly with ADHD because im ""functioning"" up and about cleaning.. not being too late to appointments.. (I do forget things still). He is super messy, and i feel if i don't do it, our home would be such a mess, and i couldn't live like that as he came from a super messy, unhealthy house share before moving into our home..

**Me, and My ADHD, Living with Family**:

This is where things are different..  
When i lived at my Mum in her home, my ADHD and cleaning was not a thing.  
I had clothing that was pilled up on a chair in my room, the bathroom was a state, i had mouldy cups from where i've left half drunk coffee in them; I would be so late for work, id tell myself ""Ill move them when i get home"" and never do..  
I was always late to appointments..  
When i got home from work , so many times i would just drop and not want to move because my day at work would have been super busy.. and i would be in a paralysis..

You just could see my ADHD a mile off..

**So Many Questions:**

So, why is it my ADHD isn't functioning in my Mums home, but soon as i am in my own place.. i have this form of ""structure"" and my traits aren't so vivid?? At work they are, i cant sit still, i don't focus enough and i get bored out of my mind so easily.. (desk job)",2,1765377934.0,adhdwomen,1,0.75,False

Sadge: Spider Hat, Aqua Spiked Collar, Skinny Vanilla Latte, Leather Journal

Merry: Yellow Palm Cap, Hibiscus Chain, Iced Coffee, Nail Buffers

I have NOT been using the Golden Party Hat after I found out it disabled some attacks. People also seem to be saying that Sadge is very mid (I haven’t been terribly impressed either) and Pride got ranked only as A tier. Should I dump Sadge for Sad and I guess replace Pride with Panic? And what item loadout would work better, should I be using the party hat or putting the halo on some more deserving pet?

Hello,

***I originally posted this to the IF board because that's where I originally got most of my inspiration to go on this journey, however I thought it'd be helpful to also post this here for anyone who may need some motivation to keep pushing.***

The beginning of this year cut me deep & made something in me snap. I'd always been the skinny guy in the group. However, I realized I was sliding hard into bad habits and was slowly but surely heading towards a negative cardiovascular event of some kind.

I decided to make a change for the better 6 months ago, and I feel better for having done so. I can run faster than I did in HS & lift harder than I did in my service.

*For reference I am 5'11 (180cm) & my starting weight was 213lbs (96kg) I am now 163lbs (73kg).*

**What I did/am doing:**

***- For the first 3-4 months I did 18:6 IF*** eating between 12pm & 6pm. I was at roughly a 500-600 calorie deficit for most of this time. At 6 months, I sort of still stick to this but not as stringently. I am now at my maintenance calories most days with some days in a deficit as it's hard to meet maintenance in an IF window sometimes.

\- I ate my goal body weight in protein every single day & am still doing so now. I usually eat low fat, low carb high in protein meals.

\- I completely removed processed sugar from my diet which was extremely soul crushing & eye opening at first on how much I depended on sugar. I learned that the morning coffee wasn't what I was addicted to, but the sugar and creamer I was putting in it.

\- I have never missed a day walking 10-15k steps, I have truly found a love for walking. Since June I have walked a distance roughly akin to walking from Miami to Boston (around 9.5 miles a day)

\- 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, no excuses

**My exercise routine:**

Monday: Chest Day, 10k steps

Tuesday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Wednesday: Leg Day, 10k steps

Thursday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Friday: Arm Day, 10k steps

Saturday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Sunday: 10k steps (Full Rest)

I don't recommend going cold turkey into the working out if this is something you'd like to mirror unless you know what you're getting yourself into. This is not my first rodeo when it comes to exercise and I was well aware of what it'd take to maintain this kind of consistency fitness wise.

**Some inspirations that got me here:**

The book ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. This book helped change the way I look at my goals and also myself. I **HIGHLY** recommend it. Learning that it's the PROCESS to your goals that matters and the foundations in which you build them upon really pushed me forward.

1pj4arc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pj4arc/false_sense_of_security/,False Sense of Security,"When the love of my life started working nights we decided that it was time that I was armed. We live in a state where I could purchase and carry a firearm. We went to the local store. We found one that fit my hand nicely and that I was comfortable with. We purchased my firearm and went to the range. I learned how to load my gun, how to fire my gun, and most importantly, how to become comfortable with it. We practiced enough over a few weeks that my gun became something I was not only at peace with, but comfortable with too. The fact is that in this day and age it seemed smarter to be armed than not to be.



Say what you will, but a woman alone in this day and age can be a scary situation, and we would both rather err on the side of caution.



And from there a habit was created. I did not leave the house without my gun. When he wasn't working at night, we would sit on the couch in the evenings with the door open with it at our sides. When we went to bed at night we would bring it with us and set it on my nightstand. When I got up in the morning I carried it to the living room with me. I cannot say that it was ingrained in me to grab for it if trouble arose, but I did have it if I needed it.



The minute we knew he would be working out of town we decided that we needed to up our home security. I hated that he was away. This man was the epitome of my security. He made me feel safe in all that I did and all that I faced. Without him there with me I began to have home invasion nightmares. They were so realistic and terrifying. I would wake up breathing hard with my heart racing and sometimes even tears still wet on my face. So to make me feel less afraid, the next step to our personal comfort was to install security cameras. I got on Amazon and found ones that looked like they would serve us well. Our home is on an island about 300 yards from the beach and it is elevated like almost all the homes here on The Gulf, so I knew I needed several of them. He was already out or town, so I installed them myself. I put one pointing at our front door, one pointing down the stairs that led up to our porch, and one pointing at the driveway.



With the way I had them set up we could clearly see anyone approaching. The cameras are sensitive and they pick up any motion at all. This turned out to be both a good and a bad thing. In the beginning I had all three on at all times. I had them set to alert me any time they picked something up. This ended up getting me hundreds of alerts a day. No exaggeration. Every car that went by, even the road adjacent to ours, every bird that landed on our railing, every time the wind blew hard and moved the plants or trees. This wasn't going to work. I couldn't turn down the sensitivity, and I couldn't deal with them going off every few seconds and having to delete hundreds of meaningless videos every day. That led to a new habit. In the morning, I would turn the cameras off while I was at home. Then I had an alarm set that would remind me every evening to turn them all on again. This arrangement worked out really well. And, it led to an amazing discovery. Coyotes.



Now I know that coyotes can be dangerous animals. But to me they were just doggies. I didn't try to tame them. I didn't try to approach them. But I did start disposing of leftovers in the yard right below the camera that covered the driveway. It became a happy thing to watch them. I would get an alert and that the camera picked something up and would turn on the live feed. When the cameras are activated at night, they have lights that light up the area, and I could see them very well. There was a “family” of three. They didn't always come together. Sometimes it would be two, or just one but no matter how many showed up, it always made me happy. So much so that I became upset when they didn't come. I would be watching tv on the couch and the app would alert me, my doggies, aka the coyotes were here. I would watch as they would eat their small offering then go on their way. They were timid. If a car went down the adjacent street they would hide in the shadows before returning to their food. They showed no signs of aggression or being rabid and they quickly became a remote pet of sort. They would come early evening, usually around 8pm, while it was already very dark. Then they would return early morning, while still dark, usually around 4am.



In the beginning the alerts for the cameras would wake me up when they went off at those odd hours. I would look at my phone and see that it said motion was detected in the driveway. I would check it, it was the coyotes. I would go back to sleep. After about a month of this, I stopped waking up to the alerts. They had become part of my routine and therefore no longer woke me. It was just the coyotes. I would get up in the morning, make my coffee and sit down with a steaming mug to watch my distant pets and deactivate the cameras.



Last night I had another one of my nightmares. In my dream there were two men at my front door. I could hear them talking to one another right outside my front door. I reached for my gun on the nightstand and it wasn't there. I reasoned that I must have left it on the couch after a late night of binge-watching Christmas movies. There was no way I could get to it without passing by the glass front door. They would see me. I was filled with panic and terror. I woke up shouting the name of my love. My heart was beating so hard. Tears were streaming down my face. I laid still for a minute getting my breathing under control. I got an alarm tone, there was motion detected in the driveway. My coyotes. Just knowing they were out there helped me calm down. I reached to my night stand. I was stunned to find that my gun was truly not on there. I had indeed forgotten it on the couch. I got up and went to the living room. There it was. Right where I had been sitting last night. I sat on the couch and held it in my hand, my head sinking low. I was ashamed of myself. What if I had indeed had intruders and not just a nightmare of them.



Well there was no way I was getting back to sleep after this. It was 4:30am and I usually get up at 6:30 anyway so I might as well just make a cup of coffee, find a movie to distract me from my self-disappointment and then watch my “doggies” videos. And so it was. With my warm mug of peppermint mocha coffee, I turned on the tv and searched for something cute to watch, a feel-good holiday movie. Finding one, I started it playing and picked up my phone to check my app.



It didn't show the just the couple of alerts that I normally woke up to. There we more than double the normal alerts. Thinking they must have come several times during the night I opened it up. It showed that I had alerts of motion on the stairs, which sometimes happens as the coyotes pass in the covered area at the bottom of the stairs. This didn't alarm me. What did alarm me was alerts to motion at the front door. The coyotes have never ever come upstairs. I opened that on first. Tears ran down my face as I watched and listened. There were two men at my door. They were talking to each other while trying to get in door. Then suddenly they react and take off away from the door. I opened every video. I watched them walk up to my house. I saw them ascend the stairs. I watched them at the door. I watched them leaving. What I didn’t watch was the video of my coyotes this morning that helped to calm me down. There was no coyotes. The alert to motion on the driveway that I thought was them was two men fleeing my yard.",2,1765377767.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Our room in Sorrento is huge, with a giant bathtub, and electric blinds that offer various levels of sunlight to pass through the windows. Waking up from a super comfortable sleep on our massive beds, the family heads down to the 2nd floor, dedicated entirely to breakfast. There were breakfast cakes, brownies, bacon, fruit, coffee, hot chocolate, chefs making omelets on command, and pretty much anything else you can think of. The Hotel Favorito is a five-star hotel, and the rooms and food reflect that.

After breakfast, we head to our pickup point. The man who picked us up works at Il Turuziello, the farm where we did the tour. Our tour guide, Elsa, meets us in their private family church, where she happily explains to us that three families live and work on the farm, connected by second cousins that follow a deep, rich generational history. Both families shared a set of grandparents that had siblings in teen numbers, making for a large familial community. This is directly reflected in the delicious food they produce, with a deep history that ties back to their bred and born Italian heritage.

Sitting in the small but beautiful church, Elsa states that this church was made in the 13th century, then restored in the 17th century. During the restoration, the floors were painted with lemons and lemon flowers. The organ was crafted for their church in the 16th century, which was also when the church was decorated with marble.

After seeing the church, we are taken through the lemon fields. The first lemon secret of our tour is that lemons are not native to Italy, but rather imported from China and India, thanks to Marco Polo. Elsa states that every family believes their limoncello is the best, but here on this farm, I’m convinced they may be telling the truth. To make the limoncello, they pick the lemons at 7 am, peel the lemons with a potato peeler, and add the alcohol to the peel. The stronger the alcohol, the stronger the lemon flavor. Once the ingredients are combined, it goes into a dark box for fermentation, after which the sugar is added.

As we walk through the lemon forest, we see the life stages of sour fruit. We see beautiful white flowers that begin forming into tiny green lemons. These small fruits grow, progressing into what appear as limes but are really “teenage lemons”, which will be ready for harvest in the next year. On this farm, lemons take one year to grow from baby to adult for the year’s harvest.

As we walk through the sour jungle, Elsa points out the canopy of netting that rests atop the trees. While this certainly assists with preventing bug infestations, the primary use of the canopy is to protect the lemons from the harsh sun. Too much sun can burn the lemon zest, which makes for poor limoncello. To keep bugs away from the lemons, appealing flowers like Hydrangea and Roses are grown to distract the bugs from the yellow fruit.

We then walk to a baby lemon tree, which grows upright before branching off at an unusual angle. This is because lemon seeds planted in the ground will not grow lemons, only lemon flowers. To amend this, all lemon branches are grafted onto bitter orange trees, which exist within the same fruit family. However, that is not the only reason that bitter oranges are used. The Turuziello family farm prides itself on being pesticide-free; the only issue is, mice love lemons, especially during the winter. However, more than lemons, mice love bitter oranges. By leaving a few branches of bitter orange on their lemon trees, the mice will leave the lemons alone. Some of the trees on this farm are over a hundred years old and still producing fruit. To keep the trees healthy, they are pruned every two years at the end of October.

Leaving the produce section of the farm, we are loaded onto an extremely small car that somewhat resembles a golf cart. There are many of these tiny automobiles, as they take turns driving the guests up to the large hill through tight corners and alleys. The road is windy, fast, exhilarating, and reminds me of a roller coaster. Once we reach the top, we are given some red wine and hard cheese. The first cheese we taste is a provolone that is eight months old. The next is the same cheese except it’s twenty-four months old. The cheese is sweet and delectable, and the family is happy to inform us that their cheese is less sharp and sweeter on purpose. As we nibble down to the rind, we see three cats weaving through the guests, putting on a beautiful show, hoping for payment in leftovers. Being an animal lover myself, I’m unable to resist their charms and give them the hardened rind left behind.

Once I’ve finished my snack, there is time to spare as the family races to transport the remaining guests. Though I do not find myself bored, taking a moment to enjoy the beautiful scenery from above Sorrento.

We are led to a table of dried breads and infused olive oils. As we taste each distinctly different flavor, the Turuziello family advises us that these oils are not meant for cooking, as the heat will destroy the flavor. Extra-virgin olive oils are cold-pressed twice, and cost more for that reason. The best way to use extra virgin olive oil is to dress your dish with it at the end to enhance your plate.

Of the oils we tasted, there was a basil oil best used for marinara. A truffle oil filled with umami, best used for fresh cheese and pasta. The lemon and orange olive oils were tangy and sweet, intended for salads. However, the most shocking to me was the hazelnut oil, which was very sweet and is meant for sharp cheese, pancakes, and vanilla gelato. In Italy, there are 533 varieties of olive.

As we finish our oil tasting, we are led into the cheese-making room where they are setting up the demonstration. It all begins with unpasteurized buffalo milk, used for its higher fat content, and the need for enzymes to create cheese. Some use lemon juice or vinegar because of its accessibility, but the Turuziello family uses artichoke and milk thistle directly from the flower in order to achieve a purer flavor.

The cheese used to make mozzarella is sour, the same type that would be used for sourdough bread. Three hours after the enzyme ingredients are added, the milk separates. Thankfully, we don’t have to wait that length of time, as the Turuziello family came prepared.

Once the melting point is reached, the curd is drained from the whey. The curd is then added to hot water to speed up the fermentation, folding it over and over by hand to observe its reaction and ensure the cheese transforms perfectly from delicate curds to chewy mozzarella. After the cheese is folded, it must be shaped. It can be shaped into a braid, a knot, a ball, a flower, or even a “knob” used to hang the cheese for drying. Mozzarella that has been dried makes for perfect pizza. Realistically, any knot can be recreated by mozzarella while it’s in this rubbery state. Once it’s been tied, it must chill for one hour before being dunked in salt water. We are given a taste of the final product, which holds a delicious sour taste, indicating its freshness.

But what do you do with the leftover whey? Well, it helps to aid digestion, so it can be drunk to soothe your stomach, and it’s cheaper than medicine. If you aren’t experiencing stomach upset, it has many other uses, such as feed for the pigs, an ingredient for bread, or to create even more cheese! The whey protein from other cheeses is recooked, causing the leftover milk proteins to curdle and solidify. This creates delicious ricotta cheese, meaning “re-cooked” cheese, despite the lack of fat added to the whey. I find it both fascinating and delightful to know that there is truly nothing wasted on the Turuziello family farms.

Now it’s time to taste some limoncello. We learn that limoncello is always kept in the freezer, because it does not freeze. When buying limoncello, you should never buy anything with less than 27% alcohol, otherwise it will freeze. There are four ingredients in proper limoncello: lemon zest, alcohol, sugar, and water. As miniature drinks are passed around, I can taste the tartness of the lemon, which burns my throat in a pleasurable way as I swallow the sweetness.

Traveling back down the hill, it’s time to make our pizza. We wait at our table for our turn, where each guest is given a small ball of dough to form the crust. Elsa shows us how to toss and stretch the dough before lathering it in sauce and mozzarella. At this time, the school lets out, and while making our pizza, her toddler son comes rushing in to see his mother. I don’t speak Italian, but I am informed after the fact that he is told to go and see his grandmother. Unfortunately, this is not what he wants, and a small fuss is kicked up. Fortunately, a quick bite of cheese is enough to make him happy, and he’s on his way. I found this to be very cute and charming, and it sits in my mind as just another example of the love and care that goes into everything within the Turuziello family farm.

Once our pizza is finished, we sit back at our table and enjoy the steamy meal with a glass of wine. To end our trip, the Turuziello family gives us a few last words, emphasizing the importance of peace. It’s important that we do not fight with those around us, because once things are said and done, you cannot always go back. True value is in family, friends, and living together. Do not envy others, as they are often faking. It’s important to always be thankful for the life we have been given.

I would love some opinions on my relationship with my mother. She is a loving, kind, caring & understanding mother who brought me and my siblings up (along with our dad) well. I am in my early thirties, moved out when I was 17 and have been married a few years now. She loves my husband, we have no children yet. We have remained in contact, I go to her with major issues and always seek our her advice in times of need. However..

I have found myself over the past few years feeling like there is a huge gap in our relationship. She loves to meet for coffee, go to lunch etc. But when I suggest to do anything more than that, there is resistance, excuses. She did not come to my wedding (overseas) and she doesn't go to any of my parties, any nights out and do anything on a evening. Writing this, it feels so ridiculous, but the feelings of it are hurting me and I don't know why. One of my siblings who lives with her also behaves the same way which hurts me too, as we have a close bond so it just increases my confusion. My mother doesn't drink EVER so I can completely understand why nightclubs, parties and what not would never be her gig - I would never expect her to be outside her comfort zone. I just feel I'm missing that mother daughter going shopping, movie nights, one on one time. I don't know how to approach her as she is sensitive and gets upset as she has been a great mum to me, but I find myself getting upset by the lack of spending time with me as a adult. I am not talking weekly occurances, we all have busy lives. The resistance hurts my feelings. She can be anxious and doesn't have high self esteem - there has been a lot of anxiety in my family which we are all working through in our own individual way and together. I was quite overweight in my late teens and early twenties, which made me feel shamed when I spent time with any of my family. I now have lost the weight, but the feelings of that maybe are still present, its very confusing. I just don't want to feel like this for the rest of my life, like its a arms length relationship. I just don't know what step to do as I never want to make her (or my sibling) feel stressed but I can't ignore my feelings ",1,1765377710.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1pj49l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewYouTubeChannels/comments/1pj49l1/need_help/,Need help,"I've ummed and erred on this for a while.

started a channel on the 17th August this year

I have a mid size channel on YouTube 15-20k Subs, that provides me a modest monthly income.

What's prompted this is one particular supportive user that has sent a flurry of generous donations over the last few weeks via the Supers feature.

I've drafted this to post in my community tab as an explanation.

BUT

im kinda unsure how it will go down.

There's a lot at stake should it not be taken in the faith I intend it to.

Hence why I'm here on a throwaway account to get feedback from fellow Tubers.

........

Hey everyone ❤️

I’ve wanted to say this for a while, so here it is straight.

First — thank you. Some of you have been unbelievably generous with Super Thanks, Super Chat, and Super Stickers. It honestly blows me away every time.

But I’ve run into two problems I can’t ignore anymore​

The fees are ridiculous Last month you sent £458 through those features. What reached my bank £147. That’s roughly 68% gone, 30% to Apple on mobile purchases, then YouTube takes a big cut of what’s left after transaction and foreign ex fees. It never felt right that so much of your kindness gets eaten before it even reaches its destination

One person donation bursts can get awkward When someone sends a bunch of large Supers in a short window, it can create weird pressure or expectations on both sides — even when no one means for that to happen. Turning the features off removes that whole dynamic completely.

So after thinking it through, I’ve disabled Super Chat, Super Thanks, and Super Stickers altogether.

If anyone ever wants to support the channel directly, the only options now are Buy Me a Coffee and PayPal where almost everything actually reaches me.

But seriously… there’s never any pressure. Watching, liking, commenting and sharing and just being here is already more than enough. I made this change to make sure your generosity goes where you intend it to.

You’re all absolute legends. Thank you, always ❤️​",1,1765377687.0,NewYouTubeChannels,1,1.0,False

My question is about the machine's yield. It used to pull about 60ml for a double shot. With the OPV adjusted the automatic setting is cutting the brew short at about 20ml. 

Does the machine measure the flow rate ahead of the OPV? This would explain the difference in my mind. When doing this mod, do you ""forfeit"" the auto brew feature and require manual mode to get the proper yield?",1,1765377588.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1pj47k6,https://i.redd.it/lqdnmfmmzd6g1.png,On the Brazilion: a modest proposal for an unreasonably large natural number 🇧🇷,"*Abstract.*  
We introduce the **Brazilion**, a natural number so catastrophically large that previously popular “big numbers,” such as Graham’s number, now serve primarily as warm-up exercises in emotional resilience. We formalize its definition, compare it to existing large-number notation, and briefly discuss its profound implications for the field of recreational overkill.

#                                     Introduction

Popular discourse in large-number theory has, for historical reasons, fixated on various celebrity quantities, e.g. Graham’s number, TREE(3), and values of the Busy Beaver function. While these objects are undeniably enormous, they suffer from a fundamental shortcoming: none of them is called the Brazilion.

We rectify this deficiency.

#                                      Preliminaries

Let us fix some standard notation from logic and combinatorics:

* TREE(3)\\mathrm{TREE}(3)TREE(3): the classical TREE(3) from Kruskal-style combinatorics.
* Σ(n)\\Sigma(n)Σ(n): the Busy Beaver function on input nnn.
* Fα(x)F\_\\alpha(x)Fα​(x): the fast-growing hierarchy at ordinal index α\\alphaα.
* Γ0\\Gamma\_0Γ0​: the Feferman–Schütte ordinal.
* Rayo(n)\\mathrm{Rayo}(n)Rayo(n): Rayo’s function, where Rayo(n)\\mathrm{Rayo}(n)Rayo(n) denotes the smallest natural number greater than any number describable in a fixed formal language of set theory using at most nnn symbols.

We assume the reader is either familiar with these or willing to pretend.

#                            Definition of the Brazilion

>B:=Rayo ⁣(FΓ0(Σ(TREE(3)))).\\boxed{ \\mathfrak{B} := \\mathrm{Rayo}\\!\\big(F\_{\\Gamma\_0}(\\Sigma(\\mathrm{TREE}(3)))\\big). }B:=Rayo(FΓ0​​(Σ(TREE(3)))).​

Informally: we first take TREE(3), feed it into Busy Beaver to obtain a number already beyond any computable growth fetish, then pass that into the fast-growing hierarchy at Γ0\\Gamma\_0Γ0​, and finally apply **Rayo’s function** to the result, just in case anyone still had hope.

#                                  Basic properties

We now state, without proof (for the reader’s mental health), several immediate consequences.

>

*Proof sketch.*  
Graham’s number is computable by a finite recursive scheme expressible in a few lines of notation. All such numbers are crushed pointwise by sufficiently large arguments to Rayo’s function, which we apply at the argument FΓ0(Σ(TREE(3)))F\_{\\Gamma\_0}(\\Sigma(\\mathrm{TREE}(3)))FΓ0​​(Σ(TREE(3))). The details are left as an exercise, preferably to one’s worst enemy. 5. Philosophical discussion

The introduction of the Brazilion raises several deep questions:

1. **Epistemic:** Can a human truly “comprehend” B\\mathfrak{B}B? Answer: No, but neither can they comprehend TREE(3), and that hasn’t stopped anyone from using it in memes.
2. **Linguistic:** Why “Brazilion”? Because it sounds like someone mispronouncing “brazilian” while inventing a new cardinality class. This is considered a sufficient axiom for nomenclature.
3. **Sociological:** What happens to Graham’s number now? It is respectfully retired to the role of a *medium-sized integer* used for teaching undergraduates humility.

#                                     Future work

We briefly outline possible extensions:

* The **Brazilion+**: B+:=Rayo(B)\\mathfrak{B}\^+ := \\mathrm{Rayo}(\\mathfrak{B})B+:=Rayo(B).
* The **Brazilion hierarchy**: B0=10\\mathfrak{B}\_0 = 10B0​=10, Bn+1=Rayo ⁣(FΓ0(Σ(TREE(3)))+Bn)\\mathfrak{B}\_{n+1} = \\mathrm{Rayo}\\!\\big(F\_{\\Gamma\_0}(\\Sigma(\\mathrm{TREE}(3))) + \\mathfrak{B}\_n\\big)Bn+1​=Rayo(FΓ0​​(Σ(TREE(3)))+Bn​).
* The **Trans-Brazilionic ordinal zoo**, reserved for when set theorists get bored again.

#                                         Conclusion

We have constructed a single integer, the **Brazilion**,

which serves as a convenient unit of “absolutely unreasonable largeness.” Any future attempt to impress the internet with gigantic numbers is now required, by unwritten meme convention, to answer the question:

>

**TL;DR:** I propose we officially adopt the **Brazilion** as  
Rayo(FΓ0(Σ(TREE(3))))\\mathrm{Rayo}(F\_{\\Gamma\_0}(\\Sigma(\\mathrm{TREE}(3))))Rayo(FΓ0​​(Σ(TREE(3)))),  
so that Graham’s number can finally retire and open a small coffee shop.

⚠️ Trigger Warning

This is the recap of the monetized posts from Kylea and Joseph ""Joe"" Gomez of Kylea G, You Grow Girl from 11/15/25-11/21/25.  

⏸️ Kylea made no posts on 11/21, creating speculation she was under restriction from Meta.

Disclaimers: I am not a physician, influencer, or paid content creator.  I am not affiliated with WW.  I have no background in law; however, I am semi-retired from the healthcare field with multiple college degrees.  These opinions are my own based on social media content.  I wish no harm to Kylea & Joe Gomez or Kylea's legal team.

👋 everyone!  Let's take a peek into Kylea's ""busy"" schedule and latest complaints.  

Takeout & Shopping 

11/15 Sonic soda for Kylea; Unknown Mexican restaurant for dinner with bio dad and brothers

11/16 Dutch Bros for Kylea; Dollar Tree, Walmart & Sam's Club for road trip snack haul for family

11/17 Wendy's beverages for Kylea & Joe; Hobby Lobby: Christmas decor

11/19 Dutch Bros for Kylea and her dad; HTea0 1/2 gallon of tea for Joe; Walmart: scented socks for Joe

11/20 Five Below: pajama pants for Kylea and her mama

Travel

There were multiple references about their holiday plans.

Pets, Family & Religion

11/15 Joe recently got Kylea a pawprint apartment key; Facebook Story with Oliver on the couch; 40+ photos of Kylea & Joe in honor of their upcoming wedding anniversary; Joe allegedly stayed home while Kylea went out to celebrate her brother's 27th birthday

11/16 They skipped church to rest up for future vacations; Birdie's obsessed with socks and torn jeans due to her pica

11/17 Discussed Birdie eating cat litter when she was young, costing Kylea thousands in vet bills; Kylea cries for 30 minutes trying to get Birdie to give her a sock; They spent 4k on their dream couch and *if they move* are happy they can order additional pieces

11/18 Video of Alice in spare bedroom, also shown in a photo but the windows will not be opened for the cats to look out due to safety concerns; Kylea claimed the spare bedroom door is ""always open"" which is a lie and they live near 5 lanes of traffic so Birdie can't be off leash.  Birdie gets to play with family member's dogs

11/19 They are afraid Oliver will bite and scratch Birdie, so they don't let her try to play with him; Video of Birdie playing with her squeaky chicken; Today is their 8th wedding anniversary; Her paternal grandma used a laser engraver to make a custom cowboy hat for Kylea's Christmas gift

11/20 Birdie was groomed and Kylea showed off Birdie's Christmas gifts.  Claimed she got scratch pads for the cats but didn't discuss it because Facebook has removed/flagged posts from other creators who discuss cat nip.

*No video content was posted of Birdie on a walk or playing with her puzzles/ball pit. 

Health & Fitness: 

11/15 She's in a deep depression due to the Facebook pages that bully, harass, and stalk her daily; 2-part Facebook Story about her grief journey 

11/16 She'll continue to block pages made about her and she'll never make an UNkind comment to others about their food choices; Facebook Story about her grief and long replies about her PTSD

11/17 Sad fishing and trauma dumping about pregnancy loss and infertility.  They won't get pregnant again, foster or adopt; She must cook meat before adding it to a soup recipe due to a weak stomach from food aversions; She'll only eat steak on special occasions and it must be cooked as dry as jerky

11/18 Due to UNkind letters and cards she's received in the mail (her address is public record due to her LLC and she used to give it out asking for letters, cards, and gifts), she'll no longer open the windows for the cats; Dinner is her biggest meal of the day due to her low appetite in the mornings and afternoons

11/19 Meat that looks pink after being smoked makes her ill; They go through soda quickly due to her family members. She sends soda home with her siblings

11/20 Due to her OCD, she cleans so much she is tired and needs more rest.  Letting the laundry wait 1 day is a big deal; She threw up Chick-fil-A grilled nuggets and espresso in her vehicle in the past, which is why her coffee MUST be sweet or she can't keep it down. Bold flavored coffee makes her ill. 

*No videos of Joe at the gym were shared; no walking pad content was shared; no content was shared on Facebook showing Kylea on a walk to elevate her heart rate.

Final Thoughts

Stop exploiting tragedy, conflict, grief, and loss. Goodness.  She's addicted to drama and doesn't care who she triggers. 

If the taste of coffee makes you physically ill and you have to add a myriad of sweetened creamers, syrups, Stevia & cold foam/whipped topping to extremely watered down coffee...stop drinking it.  Stop pretending you love coffee.  There is NO way Dutch Bros, 7 Brew, Scooters, The Human Bean, etc. are watering down her beverages. She's lying about illnesses and symptoms again... She should talk to her therapist about that ASAP. ✌️ 

☎️ If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, please call or text 988 for assistance.  Please speak with a medical professional about any questions or concerns you have about your health.  Please contact a veterinarian about any questions or concerns you have about your pet(s).

I'm   Cris ''M40' and I'm in a long term relationship 12 years with 'F-34' .. we have been together(not married ) we have a daughter of 8 years. In one sumer I've find out P was cheating  on me with another man ..chatting online and sending  nudes. On that moment I was alone visiting  my dad. I didn't  confront  her.. I just got mad and went drinking  with a buddy of mine . And latter on he invited  me to go to his girlfriend house and keep the party going.. I went there I meet G 'F27' she is blonde brown eyes super gorgeous.  She was the roommate of my mates girlfriend.  And we start chatting and talking  about  lief etc. she was in a long distance relationship with this guy... and who shee was not happy .. he was married promising her he will divorce his wife etc. And me as a rat.. I've lied to her and told her I was single divorced with a daughter (I was about  to be single when I was getting home)  anyways the night  was fantastic... I fell in love at first sight  and smell of her ..her smell is crazy divine .. and we start chatting  and next day .. and the 3 day.. we been out and then back to her flat.. and had the best sex in our life's..is like she was in my mind and me in hers. Then after a week I went back home to reality,  to confront P and end my relationship with her. When I've arrived my daughter strat crying  and hold me in her arms ..and tell  me daddy never leve me again... she broke.my hart and I couldn't  confront P and leave her, so I didn't do anything....except lying  to G again  and again  for. 9 months.. 9 months which  I've been back in my home town 5 times to see G and spend time with  her.. I was always  on the phone with her texting calling every day. For hours.. all day. I was in a proper relationship with her  helping  her with money  for rent bills .. sending  flowers  ... etc.After 9 months  G texted P realizing something  is not right... and P confirm all G's fears and all my lies went to the toilet. I was so ashamed of me ..I didn't  want to answer G phone or text for 2 days.  Eventually  I've got the courage  and talk  to her .. she was crying crush  ... she wanted  a family  with  me and I dispointed her.  We both cried.. and end it .with P was more easy.. I've told her I know about  the cheating  and thats why i  did what i did .. she didn't ssy anything  and we moved on  tougher. After 3 weeks I get a text form her asking if I'm ok ..and we started chatting again  and then meeting up with her having sex.. and in a few  days back from where I started in a relationship  with two women.  One for my daughter  and one for love.  G from time to time was giving  me hint she is not happy with my relationship with P. Forgot  to tell you .. between me and P since I've met G was no sex no fizical connection.  So G was waiting  for.me to end everything.. for 2 years she waited  saying to me it will come a day when she will.move on if I don't make the decision... and I was to afraid to do it.. and now... the worst day in my life ..in the morning  ive find out i have prostate cancer and in the evening G is telling  me she meet this guy at work a week ago ... and she will give him a chance. I've asked  if she had sex with him ..she said yes 2 times  ...  and She loves me ..and she can't wait for.me anymore.  I understand  her.. I didn't  grovel not begged... she blocked me everywhere.  After 2 days she calls me and she is saying she is missing  me. So now im confuze ..you choose another man over me ... I've told her this ...and many thing I got on my chest..  Eventually she said she will block me again .. I got panicked... and got the worst  part of my life.. begging for her to choose me .. and she didn't  she said I love you with all my soul .. but  you never brake up with your ""wife"" . And blocked  me all other the places.. later in the night  i saw she unblocked me in WhatsApp.. ive restrain my self not to contact her anyway Another  week passes.. in this week I've seen her typing  on WhatsApp and deleting the message many times trying to not write to me. And I hold.my ground until.one day when I missed her si much I've called her with a private nr .. and start chatting.  She told me she is still seeing that guy .. and she's OK..not happy just ok. And she is missing  me .. and still.loves me .I've told her that's it im buying plane tickets  and comming home.. and I.did 5 days latter I was back home I've arrived late .in the night so didn't see her that night.  Next morning  she came to my place and had coffee..chat.. and sex. She was smelling  amazing  I couldn't  resist her, even if my plan was just to talk.  Anyway she stayed with me all day and all night she left next day evening time, to meet with her new boyfriend.   I was devastated  wile she was going  to the elevator...she was looking  at me with tears on the face turning around  all the time.like whe was waiting for me to go after her and stopped her.. and I didn't.  I let her choose what she wants to do. That night was like a nightmare.  I knew she was with him .. it killed a part of me . Next day my flight was back to reality... she was working  so didn't  have much time to see her 1 hour max .. so evening cane went to her flat.. with my desire to brake all ties with her. Clearly didn't go.to plan. We ended up having sex.. and chat because  I missed my plane and stayed there all night . And wile she was sleeping  I've looked  in ther phone .. and looked  at the conversation with the other  guy.  He was treating her like a object .. everything sexual... not a hint of respect from him. In one  of the messages he asked  her a picture  of me (they talk about old relationships ) and she give one to.him and he called  me names .. and commenting something about  hopes the cancer Will.get me .. and she didn't  defend  me or said anything.  Just impasiv. This got me triggered.. I've  didn't  say anything.. in my mind what over. She wake up.. I've pretended nothing happened.. we had sex drink coffee...and left . In the airport...I lost it and texted her about everything i read. She tried  to call me a few time .. I didn't  answer.  And told her if she will call me again I will tell her boyfriend everything. She stopped and send me crying voice messages.. she was sorry  she didn't  defend  me ..she loves me etc. My plane left  so I've got 3 hours  to clam down.  When I've arrived I've texted her.. if she is OK..  she said  yes she is better  and she was going  to meet with her boyfriend.  I've blocked her on the spot. I've arrived home sleep.. next day  she called me with unknown nr I've start chatting.. she cried... she is confused  she doesn't know who to chose ...what to do. I've given her an ultimatum me or him .. she didn't take it..she is if I want to leave her she understands.  She just needs more time . I've asked  if she loves him she's saying no .. idk what to do. Forgot to say i helped her with money (I've volunteered she didn't ask for it)until this happened.  So I'm  confused if she's keeping me because I'm giving her money or something  else.

1pj44aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CedarPark/comments/1pj44aq/amazon_fedex_upsany_snackdrink_preferences/,"Amazon, FedEx, UPS-Any snack/drink preferences?","Each year we like to put out snacks and drinks for delivery personnel, since it's a hectic and busy time of year.  My mail lady absolutely loves an ice-cold Coke and cheez-its, so I have the mail figured out.  However, one year the snacks and drinks were very popular.  Another year, we were super short on extra cash so we did ""cheaper"" items such as Shasta and other cheaper snacks.  It wasn't very popular at all.  Last year we decided to go back to name brand products (Coke, Dr. Pepper, bottles of water, etc) plus sweet and salty snacks like chips, granola bars, and pistachios.  Hardly anything was touched.  

My question is-if you are a delivery driver, do you like finding snacks and drinks at houses?  If so, what kinds of items?  I've even thought about putting my keurig out there for some hot coffee/cocoa on cold days but I'm not sure if there is time to wait on it to be made.

After 2 days she calls me and she is saying she is missing  me. So now im confuze ..you choose another man over me ... I've told her this ...and many thing I got on my chest..  Eventually she said she will block me again .. I got panicked... and got the worst  part of my life.. begging for her to choose me .. and she didn't  she said I love you with all my soul .. but  you never brake up with your ""wife"" . And blocked  me all other the places.. later in the night  i saw she unblocked me in WhatsApp.. ive restrain my self not to contact her anyway Another  week passes.. in this week I've seen her typing  on WhatsApp and deleting the message many times trying to not write to me. And I hold.my ground until.one day when I missed her si much I've called her with a private nr .. and start chatting.  She told me she is still seeing that guy .. and she's OK..not happy just ok. And she is missing  me .. and still.loves me .I've told her that's it im buying plane tickets  and comming home.. and I.did 5 days latter I was back home I've arrived late .in the night so didn't see her that night.  Next morning  she came to my place and had coffee..chat.. and sex. She was smelling  amazing  I couldn't  resist her, even if my plan was just to talk.  Anyway she stayed with me all day and all night she left next day evening time, to meet with her new boyfriend.   I was devastated  wile she was going  to the elevator...she was looking  at me with tears on the face turning around  all the time.like whe was waiting for me to go after her and stopped her.. and I didn't.  I let her choose what she wants to do. That night was like a nightmare.  I knew she was with him .. it killed a part of me . Next day my flight was back to reality... she was working  so didn't  have much time to see her 1 hour max .. so evening cane went to her flat.. with my desire to brake all ties with her. Clearly didn't go.to plan. We ended up having sex.. and chat because  I missed my plane and stayed there all night . And wile she was sleeping  I've looked  in ther phone .. and looked  at the conversation with the other  guy.  He was treating her like a object .. everything sexual... not a hint of respect from him. In one  of the messages he asked  her a picture  of me (they talk about old relationships ) and she give one to.him and he called  me names .. and commenting something about  hopes the cancer Will.get me .. and she didn't  defend  me or said anything.  Just impasiv. This got me triggered.. I've  didn't  say anything.. in my mind what over. She wake up.. I've pretended nothing happened.. we had sex drink coffee...and left . In the airport...I lost it and texted her about everything i read. She tried  to call me a few time .. I didn't  answer.  And told her if she will call me again I will tell her boyfriend everything. She stopped and send me crying voice messages.. she was sorry  she didn't  defend  me ..she loves me etc. My plane left  so I've got 3 hours  to clam down.  When I've arrived I've texted her.. if she is OK..  she said  yes she is better  and she was going  to meet with her boyfriend.  I've blocked her on the spot. I've arrived home sleep.. next day  she called me with unknown nr I've start chatting.. she cried... she is confused  she doesn't know who to chose ...what to do. I've given her an ultimatum me or him .. she didn't take it..she is if I want to leave her she understands.  She just needs more time . I've asked  if she loves him she's saying no .. idk what to do. Forgot to say i helped her with money (I've volunteered she didn't ask for it)until this happened.  So I'm  confused if she's keeping me because I'm giving her money or something  else.

1pj42nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1pj42nw/still_looking_for_answers/,Still Looking for Answers,"Has anyone dealt with a similar situation?

I (27F) have had LPR on my chart with my primary care doctors, allergy and asthma doctors, and digestive doctors for years. I have confirmed GERD, and assumed LPR based on symptoms - sputum, globus, dysphagia, sore throat, pain when speaking, chronic cough, post nasal drip. 

I just had my second endoscopy (first was about 10 years ago), and they have confirmed again that I have no scarring to indicate LPR. I am waiting on Bravo results btw.

After going off of my PPIs for two weeks before the endoscopy, I feel like my symptoms were greatly reduced, though I’m still experiencing all GERD symptoms. I know I’ll need to go back on medication for the GERD, but if they’re causing LPR-like symptoms, I don’t know what treatment route to choose.

Has anyone else experienced all of these symptoms and gone through diagnostic testing to then be told it’s not there? 

I have every symptom despite diaphragmatic breathing, anxiety treatment, reducing acidic foods and coffee, and taking PPIs for the last 18-20 years. I was also diagnosed with anemia a year ago, and believe the PPIs caused the iron deficiency. Do PPIs seem to be the culprit for anyone else?

I’m so tired of not having answers for these symptoms.",2,1765377216.0,LPR,3,1.0,False

1pj41r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1pj41r4/what_is_your_worlds_take_on_sins/,What is your worlds take on Sins?,"In semi-modern media, the trope of the seven deadly sins is a collection of demons that embody well, the seven deadly biblical sins. Some tempting and some living their definition. I was wondering if anyone had a consistent collection or if they had something of a mix in the sins department. Mine are a bit more connected to the broader definition.

Sloth: I have a character named Rio that once embodied sloth. Not exactly lethargy. As you can be working but not on what you are supposed to. Rio would innocently try to take you away from your struggle for a moment to go play with him or do something you actually wanted to do. Like grab a coffee or watch a TV show together. But every time you try to get back on track he has something else you want to try out waiting. Not forcing you to stay but inviting you to spend a few more minutes unwinding.

Wrath: If Shongo is tempting you that means you have someone living in your head rent free. Just so annoying you just wanna smack them up a bit. But instead of acting, he has you hold it. Supress it. Choke it down like a bad meal. Until that one person ruins everything you take part of no matter what you're doing. Until you are a living Powder Keg and you can't stand one more time Jeremy steals your lunch at work an- Surprise, you killed him. Bashed his head in with a lunch box.  You don't even remember that you did that. You just saw...Red.

These sins and others I didn't mention are turned into sins by a Lucifer type character I have called Pecar which is a loose translation to ""Sin"" in latin. Pecar is actually a very religous demon. Loving god but hates the idea of Mortals trying to become ""better"". That there is no point in changing because ""You're all going to hell anyway, why not have some fun while were at it"". Deep down he knows that the path isn't set in stone for anyone but him. So he tries to drag everyone down with him",1,1765377154.0,worldbuilding,4,0.67,False
1pj41at,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1pj41at/some_things_i_manifest_easily_jobscareer_and/,Some things I manifest easily (jobs/career) and others hardly or never (friendships/love life),"Why this happens and do others have similar experiences. Like, I really have great success story regarding my career and jobs (in 3 years I made a lot of money / a lot according to my needs and standards) I have a career I always dreamed of, and I don't have problems in that field.

But regarding friendships and partners I really have hard time. I know how manifestation works- I don't feel desperate or needy regarding my wish to make more friends. I do feel like I am person people love to hangout with. In past I was more desperate and scared like ,,will I make new friends'' etc but I really don't feel desperate about it anymore. I genuinely feel like person who has great social life, who is loved, loves love etc. So why are those things so hard to manifest? Is it because jobs/career is part of life where we actually have more control (I work hard, I am really ambitious and people notice it), but things like interpersonal relationships , friendships etc are not really in our control, and is more about luck and it's based on things that are not in our control?

Last time I made new friends is 2 years ago- but those people are more like aquaintances - I mean, they do consider me as a friend, and I consider them but we rarely hangout, I am the one who reach out more. Even when I DO make friends it's always similar types of people and friendships- people who I don't feel fullfiled with, people who are not outgoing, who are too inhibited and introverted. I feel almost always bored with them- we always do the same stuff like just talking what's new in life, going to coffee etc, nothing interesting. But I wanna attract deeper friendships, people who are more enthusiastic (i am), and more emotionally close friendships.

And I have this problem since I know (for 10 years maybe), I am never happy with my friendships and I always feel like ,,those people are not my people'' it is haunting me since my teenage years. Although, they are not same people but always same type of people",3,1765377121.0,Manifestation,2,0.81,False

1pj40zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pj40zq/reason_2350_why_dominican_workers_are/,Reason #2350 why Dominican workers are insufferably incompetent.,"If anyone has ever lived here you'd know there is a general theme of incompetence and apathy among work culture in this country and for the most part you just deal with it, but sometimes the dumbest thing will put you over the edge. This is probably one of them. 

So I'm waiting for a package from UPS that was sent from the states. The tracking said it would be delivered by the 5th, today is the 10th. By the time the package arrived at the capital it stopped updating so I had no idea where it was for 4 days. I'm think ""alright it'll get to me when it gets to me, they'll contact me I'm sure"". 

Yesterday I wake up at 9am with 3 missed calls and 2 voice messages by a disgruntled UPS driver to the effect of ""where are you, I have your package, I already left, if you would've answered I would've had it for you"". 

So I start by saying sorry for not picking up. I don't go into detail because it's none of his business but not everyone wakes up at the crack of dawn, especially if you work afternoons and get home by 2am. I doubt he'd care anyway. And neither them or UPS even remotely gave any notice of proximity. The UPS tracking number still says the package is in the capital to this moment.

I ask him at what office can I pick up the package from, it's no issue at all; and he gets back to me ""I'll deliver it tomorrow, just pick up the phone next time. Also whats your address?"" I tell him and send him a location on WhatsApp and he says ""that's not even my area, I'll give it to the other driver"" like Igaf at this point how they manage themselves.

Now admittedly the bank that sent it didn't put on the city, just the province so there's a 45min car ride from the center of the province to my house and a 2 and a half hour drive from the province center to the capital. 

So what do I do as a reasonably decent person? I wake up early to wait for the package today. It's almost 11am, no word from them. I text the guy from yesterday, cordially say good morning, ask does he have a contact I can ask about the status of the package or if it's out for delivery. After 10min he just sends me a contact as says ""talk to him"" which would be fine but this ahole is already rubbing me the wrong way. 

I text the next guy, cordial good morning, I request an update on the delivery, if he can give me an estimated time of arrival since I do need to leave in a few hours for work ""uhhh I have your package but don't know when I'll make it out there, a lot of customers LIKE to waste our time so I can't tell you. But just be there when I call."" You absolute moron, you can't give a ESTIMATE? Is that too hard for you? You think I should gaf about your problems like you guys are doing charity work? No one ever knows when they will arrive or do something they are contractually obligated to do, everything is ""si dios quiere"" and ""it'll happen when it happens"". 

So the first moron is throwing a hissy fit for something hes not even going to deliver and he was nowhere near me, then tells me to pick up early, then the next guy has no idea when he delivers. Which is fine, it's of no direct fault of anyone, but it's the entitlement and the uselessness that gets me, at least be humble not everyone is purposefully trying to make your life more difficult but giving me attitude when I have the least responsibility for any of it is next level idiocy. I'm glad I woke up early for the typical bs of this culture. I'm gonna go have some coffee. ",1,1765377100.0,offmychest,3,0.67,False

I'm in a bit of a career crisis and looking for some perspective, especially from anyone familiar with the job market here in Geneva.

For the last couple of years, I've been working full time in the tech industry, primarily in product roles like Product Designer and Product Manager. It's been a great journey, but honestly, the job hunt here for tech roles has been brutal lately. It feels like every open position gets hundreds of applications.

About five years ago, before I fully transitioned into tech, I had solid experience as a barista. I loved the fast pace, the customer interaction, and just the ritual of making great coffee.

Any insights on the best way to apply? Like online or cold personal CV handling? 

Do I mention my Product/Tech background, or should I focus only on my old barista experience?

Still in french class, improving fast but still hard to communicate. 

Any ideas?

1pj3wmr,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/business/starbucks-workers-union-four-years-without-contract,Starbucks workers are still without a labor deal four years after their first union win. Here’s why | CNN Business,"August Code works at the first ever Starbucks location to unionize in 2021. But four years after that vote, he and his co-workers in Buffalo, New York, are still waiting on their union contract.

“I would have imagined we would have seen a contract a long time ago,” Code told CNN. “To think we don’t have a contract four years later, yeah, that’s upsetting. I didn’t think we’d be at this point.”

Tuesday is the anniversary of the first union win at Starbucks. The union-organizing campaign there has been one of the biggest successes in the American labor movement in the past few years.

Concerns over working conditions during the pandemic spurred on younger workers, generally pro-union and who make up a large share of Starbucks’ workforce, to unionize. About 560 Starbucks locations have voted for union representation since that first vote four years ago, according to the union Starbucks Workers United. (An additional 90 stores that organized have closed amid a slew of store closings).

But despite the momentum, there is still no labor contract, a key goal of union representation. Contracts can further workers’ voices and improve wages, benefits and other working conditions.

US labor laws can’t help new unions force companies to reach a deal. The laws only require employers to bargain in “good faith,” meaning there are basically no penalties if companies drag out negotiations for years.

Liz Shuler, president of AFL-CIO, told CNN that the lack of a contract at Starbucks after four years is a sign labor laws need changing.

“People want to feel they’ve taken this risk and done it for a reason, and that would be to have a contract,” Shuler said. “I think they’ll get there. But it’s going to take some time because these corporations are able to withstand this kind of effort.”

Similar to Starbucks, other recent high-profile union campaigns haven’t yet reached a first contract.

That includes Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, New York, who voted in 2022 to form the tech giant’s first union. And the United Auto Workers union last year won the right to represent workers at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee – the first shot at organizing the approximately 150,000 US auto workers employed at nonunion plants.

Both sides blame the other for lack of contract

Companies often show little willingness to meet the unions’ bargaining demands, even after their workers vote for representation.

Amazon doesn’t even recognize the victory at its unionized warehouse, continuing to challenge the results. Rank-and-file members have authorized a strike at the US Volkswagen plant, but no date has been set.

Starbucks regularly argues that its employees don’t need a union since it pays better wages and benefits than many other retailers. The union is seeking seeking wage improvement, better staffing at stores and improved scheduling rules.

Its workers continue to win representation elections. But talks between the union and management have dragged on for so long that many workers who voted in early elections have already left the company.

The two sides appear far apart on any deal, with each blaming the other since mediated talks ended this past spring.

“This company responded in such a way from the onset that we knew it was going to be a fight,” said Michelle Eisen, one of the leaders of that initial union campaign in Buffalo. She has since left the company after 15 years to work for the union.

Starbucks, meanwhile, insists it wants to reach a contract with the union.

“For months, we were at the bargaining table, working in good faith with Workers United and delegates from across the country to reach agreements that make sense for partners and for the long-term success of Starbucks,” Sara Kelly, a top Starbucks executive, told employees in a memo last month.

The union is waging an open-ended strike at about 150 stores that started on November 13 — also known as “Red Cup” day, one of Starbucks’ biggest promotional days every year.

“I truly believe this is the tipping point,” Eisen said “I’ve never seen workers as fired up as they are right now.”

Starbucks said that the strike did not affect sales that day and that the stores facing strikes are a small fraction of the 10,000 company-owned US stores. Less than 5% of Starbucks’ 240,000 front-line employees are union members.

But a union fight is another headache for Starbucks coming off years of declining sales and following hundreds of store closures in September. North American sales fell 2% over the 12 months ending in late September and would have fallen twice that much if not for increased prices. US tariffs have also boosted the price of coffee, which retails nearly 19% more than last year, according to the latest government data.

Difficult first contract is the norm

Failing to reach a quick first contract is not unique to Starbucks, or Amazon or Volkswagen.

Only 37% of newly formed unions reach an initial contract within a year, and 48% reach a deal within 18 months, according to ongoing research from by Johnnie Kallas, assistant professor of labor studies at the University of Illinois.

The American labor movement is seeking legislation that would help unions win that first contract more quickly.

Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, introduced legislation in March to impose binding arbitration if a newly formed union and the company can’t reach a contract within months.

“Workers are often prevented from enjoying the benefits of the union they voted to form when mega-corporations drag their feet, slow-walk contract negotiations, and try to erode support for the union,” Hawley said in a statement in March.

The bill has widespread Democratic support as well as a few other Republican co-sponsors. But the legislation has so far gone nowhere.

Despite the lack of legislation, Shuler voiced confidence the Starbucks union will eventually get the contract, especially because of the commitment of the union’s younger membership.

“I feel like they’re in it for the long haul,” she said.

Some of the union activists at Starbucks said the lack of a contract has made it easier to organize. That’s because it demonstrates the need for a union to improve conditions.

“It hasn’t slowed down our organizing efforts at all,” said Diego Franco, a striking union barista from Des Plaines, Illinois, and a member of the union’s bargaining committee.

Franco also expressed confidence in a win.

“Eventually, the company is going to cave and we’re going win the strong contract we’ve been fighting for – whether I’m still around or not,” he said.

Since it is our first non nespresso machine, I also want to buy beans for it. My understanding is it will take a few shots to dial in. So I am buying beans from my local coffee shop (the one my wife loves most) and they have two bag options for beans: 

A 10oz bag for $14.99

OR

An 80oz bag for $70

My wife drinks ​two double shots of expresso per day and I usually drink one double shot per week.

My very limited understanding of coffee beans is that you want them to be relatively fresh, so I don't want to over buy and have beans get ""stale"" or ""go bad"" but I also don't want to fly through the 10oz bag dialing in the machine.

I read a few strips online and it seems fun enough, but I want to hear feedback about the content overall (there are alot of comics).

I also have a (probably stupid) question about the Complete Collection. The comic is printed in short strips, which is a format I never really read before. This might sound like a stupid question, but how woild you go about reading this? I have heard this referred to as a 'coffee table book'... but can the comic be read like a novel and in long sessions? Or should they be broken up and read a few strips a day?
