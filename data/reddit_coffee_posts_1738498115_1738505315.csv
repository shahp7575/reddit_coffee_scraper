I was enjoying my first cup of coffee when the song Some Sing Some Dance by Michel Pagliaro popped into my head. 

No idea why but it made me think of other Canadian songs that were played on the radio (probably due to the MAPL regulations). 

Artists like Zappacosta, Teenage Head, Brighton Rock and Slik Toxik almost never played. 

I‚Äôll also add in Thousand Foot Krutch here. A lot newer but never got a lot of attention here - I found them on rotation on a Las Vegas rock station. 

There‚Äôs tons more. 

Who wants to take a walk down memory lane with me? Again - just the ones that have been forgotten.

I am on week 6/7 taking 80mg. Initially when I started I was ok on empty stomach but have switched to taking with a bit of food (maybe like a granola bar/ toast with some juice and morning coffee). It has somewhat eased the cramp/ ache but I still get it periodically through the day or even with a bit of food it still happens. No issues with being backed up either. 

Gaviscon also helps a tad. 

I was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions with timing and food. Or did the stomach aches happen for you around this time and did it eventually pass? 


I would rather not have to stop as it has been the best one for my symptom control. If you did have to stop did you find any other options work with similar positives? 

Methylphenidate cant do- went hypertensive and very irritable/anxious. 

Elvanse- reasonably ok but found the timing and focus aspects annoying/ rebound adhd after it wears off and still fluctuating in my mood but not as badly. ",1,1738505022.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

1ifxt95,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1ifxt95/embracing_scarcity_innovation_through_constraints/,Embracing Scarcity: Innovation Through Constraints,"You know, there‚Äôs something surprisingly inspiring about being backed into a corner with limited resources. It‚Äôs like someone tossed you a puzzle with a missing piece and said, ‚ÄúGo ahead and create a masterpiece!‚Äù Suddenly, desperation becomes motivation, and the brain kicks into a higher gear. It‚Äôs in those moments when creativity truly flourishes.

Take, for instance, the time I found myself planning a community event. I was all fired up about bringing folks together, but then reality hit like a surprise snowstorm in April‚Äîmy budget was tighter than last year‚Äôs jeans. I had visions of grandeur‚Äîfood trucks, face painting, live bands‚Äîbut was faced with a barren landscape of finances. So, I gathered my small band of merry friends‚Äîmy community of creative souls‚Äîand we huddled over coffee that was more water than brew, brainstorming ideas.

Instead of an expensive caterer, we whipped up a potluck where everyone brought a dish. It transformed our community event into an incredible feast that was not only delicious but also a tapestry of cultural flavors. Who knew Aunt Edna‚Äôs casserole could have that much creative flair? The joy on everyone‚Äôs faces as they shared food and stories was worth far more than any fancy meal could have provided.

But the solutions didn‚Äôt stop at food. With our entertainment budget resembling the last dregs of my bank account, I reached out to local musicians and artists, many of whom were just as eager for exposure as I was for a miracle. They performed for tips and the chance to showcase their talents! The community buzzed‚Äîthey were invested in the outcome, feeling part of something bigger.

And then there‚Äôs my organizational skills‚Äîor lack thereof, if we‚Äôre being completely honest. I‚Äôd once tried to devise a structured volunteer schedule for the event, but my attempts ended up resembling an abstract piece of art more than a functional plan. After a good laugh at my own expense, I pivoted. Using a group messaging app, we opted for a more organic approach. Instead of rigid shifts, I sent out hilarious ‚Äúhelp wanted‚Äù texts during the event‚Äîwho was around, who could do what? It created a relaxed environment, filled with laughter and spontaneous teamwork. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I heard, ‚ÄúHey! Who‚Äôs good at balloon animals?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan someone spot my missing sandwich board?‚Äù It was chaotic but beautiful.

These experiences taught me that when the chips are down, it‚Äôs often the creative thinking fostered through community collaboration that leads to the best solutions. In a way, it‚Äôs a reflection of God's plan‚Äîusing what we have, however meager it seems, to create something extraordinary.

So the next time you‚Äôre feeling short on resources, remember that it‚Äôs not about what you lack, but what you can make happen with the amazing people around you. Embrace the chaos, ask for help, and don‚Äôt forget to laugh at your own missteps along the way. After all, sometimes the most innovative ideas are born from humble beginnings. What about you?

1ifxsy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ifxsy7/weird_2nd_date_experience/,Weird 2nd Date Experience,"35M London UK. I went on a 2nd date with a woman off Hinge yesterday, which was a coffee and walk date, which was a bit weird as a 2nd date. We had the usual drinks date for the 1st nearly two weeks ago and tbh, I was caught off guard that she wanted to meet up again. Nothing romantic happened on the first date.

In hindsight I should‚Äôve known better. There was an 11 day gap between the dates and her communication was limited in that time. I just figured she wasn‚Äôt a big texter. It was her idea to meet up for a coffee and walk, but she planned it around meeting her friends in my area afterwards, so maybe she wasn‚Äôt willing to block out an evening and go out of her way to see me (just yet).

Yesterday, she seemed receptive enough  and playfully teased me, initially... I knew she had to meet up with friends, but I think she cut the date shorter than what it was meant to be. It ended up just being under an hour and I think initially she said I had 90mins with her. Again, nothing romantic from either of us. Should have I made a move on her? She sat me down on a bench pretty soon after we started walking for some reason, spent 10min there and carried on walking. Maybe she got cold feet because I didn‚Äôt put my arm around her or something? To be fair I also wasn‚Äôt well rested yesterday, so wasn‚Äôt exactly on my A game.

1 He likes playing games sa computer niya (Red Dead Redemption, Lies of P, Elden Ring, Horizon... mga ganiyang klase) Binilhan ko na siya isang laro before pero kasi nabanggit niya yung laro. Ngayon di ko alam kung anong magandang game na parang mga sinabi ko above.  
2 He is a hygenic person. Malinis sa katawan and gamit.  
3 He likes coffee, he even have a coffee nook sa bahay nila. But he is very specific LOL.

My life is extremely dull and repetitive, work, gym, sleep. There is noting fun or exciting, nothing ever happens, no one calls or messages me. I've tried online communities like discord servers and I still can't make any friends. I just don't know how to talk to people, how to act, how to behave.

I have had this problem my whole life, but I've always been told to not worry about it, things will get better, just focus on studying. I went to university, passed 95% of the exams and I have no motivation and incentive to finish because the wage would be lower than the state average anyway.

I try talking to people, like coworkers or people in the gym, and it never goes past small talk. No hanging out outside of work, no chatting on social media. I have asked few guys to get coffee or play pool, they come, but nothing else happens. They don't make effort to call me anywhere to introduce me to their friends.

Every attempt I've had with girls, ends up as a failure, had absolutely no success at all, usually I get ignored or very short answers. Never had a girl initiate anything with me, flirt or send nudes. Which made me believe that I am too boring, worthless loser who has nothing to offer.

The most common ""advice"" I've gotten is to just keep trying, to join social groups, to find more hobbies. But I don't live in a big city, there aren't many people, and I don't even know where and how to meet them. I have no idea how people find hobbies, I don't find anything appealing or interesting, everything is meh.  I asked people around me (family, coworkers, people in gym) what do they do for fun, and all of them said ""going out"". So social groups either don't exist or they are extremely niche in this place.

The only thing I've always cared about is making a family, getting married and having children.

1ifxoy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ifxoy5/matched/,Matched,"I was never big on dating apps, but loneliness can make you do things you wouldn't normally do. After another night of eating dinner alone, I downloaded one of those trending dating apps. It felt stupid at first‚Äîswiping left, swiping right, judging people based on a handful of pictures and a few words. But after a while, it became mechanical, almost hypnotic.

Then I matched with Claire.

She had only one picture‚Äîa black-and-white shot of her smiling, long dark hair falling over one shoulder, deep green eyes staring directly into the camera. Her bio was short: ""Looking for something real."" Something about her expression drew me in. It wasn‚Äôt the forced, filtered perfection of most profiles. She looked‚Ä¶ real.

We started chatting right away. She asked me deep, personal questions almost immediately. What scares you the most? What's your worst memory? Do you believe in fate? I answered, drawn in by how engaged she seemed.

I asked her the same, but she avoided answering, always shifting the conversation back to me. I should have thought it was strange, but I didn't. I was too flattered by the attention.

After a few days, she asked me to meet in person.

""I‚Äôd love to see you,"" she wrote. ""Meet me at 8 p.m. at The Lantern Caf√©.""

I hesitated. I‚Äôd never heard of it before. When I searched, I found almost nothing‚Äîjust an old listing with no recent reviews. The address put it on the outskirts of town, in a part I didn‚Äôt go to often. But against my better judgment, I agreed.



That night, I drove out to the caf√©. The area was mostly deserted‚Äîjust a few scattered streetlights flickering weakly. The Lantern Caf√© was a small, run-down place with a dimly lit neon sign that barely buzzed to life.

When I got to the door, my stomach twisted.

The sign read CLOSED, but the lights inside were still on.

I tried the handle, and to my surprise, the door swung open with a soft creak.

Inside, the place was dead silent. No barista, no customers. Just the hum of the old ceiling fan and the faint smell of stale coffee and dust.

Then I saw her.

She was sitting alone at a corner table, completely still.

Claire looked exactly like her picture‚Äîsame long dark hair, same green eyes. But something was‚Ä¶ off. Her posture was too rigid, her expression vacant. It was as if she wasn‚Äôt looking at me, but through me.

""Claire?"" I asked, my voice unsteady.

She smiled, but something about it wasn‚Äôt right. It was too slow, like she was mimicking an expression rather than making one.

""I was waiting for you,"" she said.

I hesitated, my fingers tightening around my phone. Something about this felt wrong, like a dream that was about to turn into a nightmare.

I glanced down and pulled up the dating app. I wanted to check our messages, to ground myself. Maybe I was just being paranoid.

But her profile was gone.

No match. No messages. No trace that she had ever existed.

A cold shiver ran down my spine.

""You won‚Äôt find me,"" Claire said softly.

I looked up, my throat dry. ""Why not?""

Her smile widened‚Äîtoo wide. ""Because I don‚Äôt exist.""

1ifxooh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ifxooh/matched/,Matched,"I was never big on dating apps, but loneliness can make you do things you wouldn't normally do. After another night of eating dinner alone, I downloaded one of those trending dating apps. It felt stupid at first‚Äîswiping left, swiping right, judging people based on a handful of pictures and a few words. But after a while, it became mechanical, almost hypnotic.

Then I matched with Claire.

She had only one picture‚Äîa black-and-white shot of her smiling, long dark hair falling over one shoulder, deep green eyes staring directly into the camera. Her bio was short: ""Looking for something real."" Something about her expression drew me in. It wasn‚Äôt the forced, filtered perfection of most profiles. She looked‚Ä¶ real.

We started chatting right away. She asked me deep, personal questions almost immediately. What scares you the most? What's your worst memory? Do you believe in fate? I answered, drawn in by how engaged she seemed.

I asked her the same, but she avoided answering, always shifting the conversation back to me. I should have thought it was strange, but I didn't. I was too flattered by the attention.

After a few days, she asked me to meet in person.

""I‚Äôd love to see you,"" she wrote. ""Meet me at 8 p.m. at The Lantern Caf√©.""

I hesitated. I‚Äôd never heard of it before. When I searched, I found almost nothing‚Äîjust an old listing with no recent reviews. The address put it on the outskirts of town, in a part I didn‚Äôt go to often. But against my better judgment, I agreed.



That night, I drove out to the caf√©. The area was mostly deserted‚Äîjust a few scattered streetlights flickering weakly. The Lantern Caf√© was a small, run-down place with a dimly lit neon sign that barely buzzed to life.

When I got to the door, my stomach twisted.

The sign read CLOSED, but the lights inside were still on.

I tried the handle, and to my surprise, the door swung open with a soft creak.

Inside, the place was dead silent. No barista, no customers. Just the hum of the old ceiling fan and the faint smell of stale coffee and dust.

Then I saw her.

She was sitting alone at a corner table, completely still.

Claire looked exactly like her picture‚Äîsame long dark hair, same green eyes. But something was‚Ä¶ off. Her posture was too rigid, her expression vacant. It was as if she wasn‚Äôt looking at me, but through me.

""Claire?"" I asked, my voice unsteady.

She smiled, but something about it wasn‚Äôt right. It was too slow, like she was mimicking an expression rather than making one.

""I was waiting for you,"" she said.

I hesitated, my fingers tightening around my phone. Something about this felt wrong, like a dream that was about to turn into a nightmare.

I glanced down and pulled up the dating app. I wanted to check our messages, to ground myself. Maybe I was just being paranoid.

But her profile was gone.

No match. No messages. No trace that she had ever existed.

A cold shiver ran down my spine.

""You won‚Äôt find me,"" Claire said softly.

I looked up, my throat dry. ""Why not?""

Her smile widened‚Äîtoo wide. ""Because I don‚Äôt exist.""

The room suddenly felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. My heartbeat pounded in my ears.

I took a step back. ""This‚Ä¶ this is a joke, right?""

She tilted her head, and for the first time, her eyes truly met mine. ""You swiped right on something you shouldn‚Äôt have.""

This is a simple method to see the fastest results. 

Here's what to do:

1. Go check your competitors who are posting google updates 

2. Post more updates than your comeptitors per week to gain an edge in terms of activity, if they dont post any updates, just post atleast 4 updates per week (the more the better)


Post updates about your menu items, achievements, client testimonials, services etc. Make sure to put proper keywords in there without making it look unnatural.

Make sure to utilize the maximum number of characters allowed, use CTAs and add images with keywords in their titles.

PROTIP: Google can read the content of the images so its good to have your business name, address, number along side your main keyword in the image of the google update.

I used this strategy to help a coffee shop rank in under 20 days resulting in a whopping 400% increase in their visbility.

I‚Äôve been a silent reader since I was diagnosed with pre-DM in December 2024. A little backstory: I had back pain in December and decided to consult a GP because I was worried it might be an internal organ causing the pain. My doctor reviewed my past medical results (I always keep them‚Äîdon‚Äôt know why, I guess I‚Äôm just that organized) and saw that my HbA1c was 5.9% from a test in February 2024. She told me I was pre-diabetic and asked if I knew about it. I said I didn‚Äôt. No one had ever told me, nor warned me. I found out late, and I regretted not knowing sooner‚Äîif I had, I would have made lifestyle changes earlier. The doctor requested another blood test, and thank God, my A1c remained at 5.9%. Anyway, the cause of the back pain turned out to be pinched nerves, so I was also given muscle relaxants.

When I found out I was pre-DM, I was so upset with myself. I cried for hours. My medical results from February 2024 already showed I was pre-DM, and I didn‚Äôt know. I thought everything was fine. After I learned about it, I crash-dieted. I became scared of food. My FBS and RBS were always in the normal range (70-80), and I was always on the thinner side. I used to weigh 50kg, and now I‚Äôm down to 46kgs. 

But you know what? I‚Äôm actually happier now. I‚Äôm living healthier. My doctor said it‚Äôs mostly genetics, but I also have to admit I was living unhealthily in the past few years, which contributed to my situation. I think one of the biggest contributors was my addiction to coffee with lots of syrup and whipped cream, as well as my reliance on processed foods and a high-carb diet. Now, I‚Äôve reduced my coffee intake and switched to black coffee, I‚Äôm eating a low-carb diet, and I‚Äôve significantly cut back on fast food. If I do indulge in something I shouldn‚Äôt, I make sure to eat it in moderation. I also cook my own food now!

Being Asian, it‚Äôs been really hard to cut down on rice, but I switched to quinoa, which works well for my blood sugar. I‚Äôm eating a lot more fiber now as well. Another thing I appreciate now is exercise. I used to feel weak with no muscle, but now I can‚Äôt go a day without doing strength training. I also do Pilates for my back and run 3 km three times a week. I love myself more now because I can see how much I‚Äôm enjoying all the positive lifestyle changes I‚Äôve made.

I‚Äôm meeting with my doctor again in three months, and she believes in me. We agreed that I can lower my A1c through lifestyle changes, which is why she didn‚Äôt prescribe any medications.

To everyone who‚Äôs scared and always lurking through this sub for advice, I recommend you filter out what you can realistically apply to your own life. This sub has been helpful and motivating to me because I‚Äôve seen so many people lower their A1c. So yes, it‚Äôs possible for everyone.

All the best! See you again in 3 months, hopefully the results will be better :) ",2,1738504237.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to meet and chat with new people about whatever we want, slowly getting to know the other better. I'm hoping for those chat to develop into a long term friendship where we can support each other and lend a hear to the other during difficult times. If we're attracted to each other it could lead to something more as I think the best relationship start with friendship rather than appearing spontaneously but I'm fine if we just stays as friend. It would be best if you live in Europe in order to avoid struggling with time zones. I'm open to meet and have a drink/meal together if we live close to each other. I'm also looking to travel to another country sometimes next year so if you live in an interesting place to visit that might be a good occasion to meet in the future.

Here's some info about me :

I'm 29, I live in France near Paris. I work as a software developer. Appearance side, I have brown eyes and hair.

I like videos games, mostly RPG and indie games but also some coop games. I like playing board games with my friends and reading (recently started the Terry Pratchet books). Being lazy in my couch watching youtube videos about internet mysteries is my guilty pleasure.

I'm practicing martial arts, running (I'm participating to some running events throughout the year to prepare for a marathon next year) and a bit of bouldering.

I tend to be more of a homebody as I like to stay at home chilling especially during winter where I can be comfy watching TV with a plaid and some coffee. But I also like from time to time to move outside to see a friend or all other kind of occasion.

I really like animals, even though I don't have any at the moment so feel free to send me a pic of your pet if you have any.

Reading through this sub, I‚Äôve been trying to figure out the best routine for me. First 9 days, I‚Äôd get up and take all my morning meds (statin, antihistamines, dexilant ((to treat GERD)), Saxenda, and Vitamin D). Right after my morning meds, I have frittata bites (10g of protein) and my two cups of coffee.  First day or two, I‚Äôd feel the vyvanse kick in. Physically feel it like a switch turned on. 

This morning I woke up around 6:10 so got up and took my pill on an empty stomach. Just the Vyvanse. I went back to bed.  Got up around 8am and took the rest of my pills, had my eggs and coffee.  Just sitting here now, 2.5 hrs after taking it, I literally just had the most intense feeling of the medication really kicking in. Almost like a flush feeling passing through me. I‚Äôm only on 20mg, so not a high dose.  

Thoughts on this routine? I‚Äôd read here that taking with protein enhanced efficacy, so if been making sure to eat right away.  But taking it on an empty stomach seems to have had such a stronger effect. You guys all have a lot of knowledge and experience, so thought I‚Äôd see what you guys say.

He‚Äôs not in at the weekends however, and we‚Äôre open 7 days a week.

They also don‚Äôt replace the toilet rolls when they use them up, and I‚Äôm pretty sure a couple of them have never heard of a loo brush. This is throughout the week as well as the weekend although through the week it‚Äôs less noticeable because our cleaner sorts most of it out.

After reading¬†*Atomic Habits*¬†last month (better late than never, right?), I decided to overhaul my routine. The book‚Äôs advice actually worked (shocking, I know), but the real game-changer ended up being something I didn‚Äôt expect: a silly little android pplication I built on a whim. More on that later.

**Here‚Äôs what I did from the book:**

* **Habit Stacking:**¬†I started studying for 20 minutes right after brewing my morning coffee. Now my brain links coffee smell with ‚Äústudy mode.‚Äù Weirdly effective.
* **Rewards:**¬†For every 45 minutes of focused work, I let myself watch one youtube video. Turns out, I‚Äôll do¬†*anything*¬†for that dopamine hit.
* **Identity Stuff:**¬†Instead of ‚ÄúI need to study,‚Äù I tell myself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm someone who finishes tasks early.‚Äù Skipping a session now feels like betraying my ‚ú®brand‚ú®.

**But here‚Äôs the twist:**  
While testing these habits, I kept forgetting to¬†*stick*¬†with them. So I built¬†**FocusBoo**¬†(free, no ads‚ÄîI just wanted to solve my own problem). It‚Äôs basically a cute ghost named Boo who grows virtual plants while you work. Every time you finish a task, you snap a photo of your progress (notes, laptop, whatever) to share on¬†**FocusSpace**, a community feed where everyone posts their real-time FocusSnaps. The catch? You can only see others‚Äô posts if you share yours too. It keeps things honest.

**Why it clicked for me:**

* **Boo‚Äôs plants**¬†are weirdly motivating. The plants are so realistic,3d and aesthetic that it makes me addicted to unlock newer plants every day and not give up.Guilt-tripped by a pixel ghost. üòÖ
* **FocusSnaps**¬†force me to document tiny wins (like finishing a chapter or organizing notes). Looking back at my SnapBook feels like a productivity scrapbook.
* **Suncoins**¬†(earned by sharing snaps) let me unlock new seeds for Boo. It‚Äôs like a reward system that¬†*isn‚Äôt*¬†watching youtube video.

**Results after 3 weeks:**

* My desk isn‚Äôt a warzone anymore (Boo deserves a nice workspace, okay?).
* I‚Äôve actually‚Ä¶*enjoyed*¬†studying? The combo of habits + gamification tricked my brain into caring.
* The FocusSpace community is low-key inspiring. No influencers‚Äîjust real people posting messy desks and finished to-do lists.

**TLDR:**¬†Tiny habits work, but pairing them with something visual (even a goofy ghost) makes them stick. If you‚Äôve tried habit stacking or reward systems, maybe give Boo a shot? Or share your own focus hacks below‚ÄîI‚Äôm obsessed with optimizing this now.

I have a love for all that is unique and vintage. Something I enjoy is sending Snail Mail and Postcards. I have gotten use to receiving nothing in return via snail mail from friends/family so alas I am here searching for a penpal.

I collect typewriters and tend to use them for my writing. Poetry is the way my soul breathes and I look forward to sharing my craft with a penpal.

I collect and send vintage postcards, complete with vintage postage too! It‚Äôs so fun taking a break from the chaos of the every day, putting pen to paper and building a connection. 

My joys and hobbies include: thrifting, travel, cooking, coffee shops (iced lattes only), vintage fashion, poetry, card games and more.

What hobbies allow your soul to sing? Would love a penpal who wants to send creative/beautiful mail to eachother.

1ifx4s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ifx4s2/sleep_routine_is_driving_me_nuts/,Sleep routine is driving me nuts,"Am I overreacting and getting frustrated over nothing?? 

It is what it is but married early last year and husband had a baby with someone he barely knew. But wanted to be involved father, which I give him props for. However, I am pregnant in my 3rd trimester now. We have a small house and making it work until we can move. 

In the meantime, he has his 14month old for an overnight. I know every kid can be different. I was able to get my first born down at 7-7:30 and was awake by 7-8 with a wake up at 5:30-6 and fed and just let him sleep on me for that extra hour due to sleep exhaustion. 

His babe, goes to bed by 9pm and I hear a wake up at about 7am‚Ä¶ where husband tries to get him to sleep for another hour or so, but he‚Äôs crying and waking myself and everyone else. 

I guess i would he more empathic if he was holding child and trying to soothe but that isn‚Äôt happening. I feel he‚Äôs lucky as all get out that this baby sleeps until 7am. He‚Äôs is rocking the pack n play or when I got up today I saw him just sitting on couch while babe was crying loudly. 

I leave to get coffee and clear my morning brain and come home and he‚Äôs asleep. But it‚Äôs the method that is driving me crazy. 

He left the baby monitor on in the room so I already woke to that, I turn it down, then I hear the cries going on for awhile, not 5-15 minutes. 

There‚Äôs not much for me to do in this situation. I tried last night to help hold baby and not just let them cry in the pack n play to sleep like he does, but he kneed me in my very pregnant stomach several times and I handed him back over. But I feel the closeness in holding is important.. 

Idk. I‚Äôm just trying to get enough sleep while I can because soon I‚Äôll be doing all of this all over again. I‚Äôve always been more courteous to turn my monitor down with a partner but also had room space to soothe a baby, not in the living room of a small house. It‚Äôs not ideal. But we have to make it work until we can get into a new house, which we are working toward.

They were taken from me, right before my eyes. Ripped away like skin off my back. They‚Äôre dead. My wife and daughter are dead, and the police think its my fault. Like I would ever do something so horrible. I *loved* them. With all of my heart I loved my family. How dare those idiots at the police station accuse me of such a horrible

I thought I heard a noise just now, as I‚Äôm typing this out. Like someone was just outside my shitty little motel room, looking for me. He‚Äôs still out there. The man that killed my family. The man that framed me. I think he‚Äôs saving me for last. He‚Äôs close. I can feel it. He took everything from me, but no one will believe me. You‚Äôll believe me, won‚Äôt you? I‚Äôll tell you what happened. I just need someone to believe me.

Before it happened, we weren‚Äôt doing great. You know those usual familial fights? How the house can feel tense, when disagreements happen? Well, the latest one was about a school field trip. She wanted sixty dollars to go to some museum or something. But money was tight. I‚Äôd been killing myself on overtime for over a year now just to keep us afloat, but we were drowning anyways. Bills, groceries, clothes, insurance, car payments, the mortgage. God, it was just all too much.

Well anyways, I told her we can‚Äôt afford to send her but my wife insisted we could spare sixty bucks, so I had to be the bad guy. I told her we couldn‚Äôt and that was final. After that, I was getting the cold shoulder from both of them. So, when I came home that evening after another twelve-hour shift, I wasn‚Äôt surprised to receive another sad excuse for a ‚Äòwelcome home‚Äô.

My daughter sat in the living room, doing homework on our coffee table. She had folders and papers strewn about. Her backpack sat open on my chair. She didn‚Äôt acknowledge me when I walked in. My wife noticed me at least. From past our living room, in the kitchen, she gave me a lukewarm ‚Äúhello, how was work?‚Äù.

I walked past my daughter and kissed my wife in the kitchen. I felt disappointed. She kissed me dispassionately. ¬†Like she didn‚Äôt even want to kiss me in the first place.

‚ÄúLong‚Äù I replied, taking off my steel toes, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs dinner coming?‚Äù

‚ÄúIts going alright. I‚Äôm working with what I have. Did you go to the store on your way home?‚Äù

That was her first little jab of the night. Lately she loved to needle me. She would tell me about her discontentment in passing. Discontentment about not having all the foods she wants, or about how small the new house was, or about how we haven‚Äôt had a date in over a year. I knew it. I knew she felt neglected and discontent. Just another thing going wrong that I wasn‚Äôt fixing fast enough for her. ¬†

‚ÄúNo dear, I was too tired to go to the grocery.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then, its soup again tonight. I don‚Äôt have ingredients to make much else.‚Äù

There was so much more behind those words. More than I could put on a page. She knew I hated the soup we got from the food pantry. She knew I hated to go to the food pantry at all. She was saying that I failed. I failed to provide my family with dinner and now we have to rely on strangers for help. And because I failed to provide, I should be punished with food I hated.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I was at work all day.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt have a car to take to the grocery. You have the only car. So, you have to be the one to go to the store. I don‚Äôt want to make soup again, *honey*.‚Äù

That honey stung. It was a sweet shot filled with poison. Another jab. Anger swelled in me. I already knew that I was the one that had to go to the store. That I had our only car. That I fucked it up. But she just had to twist that knife a little deeper. Even after all that I provide for them. She still had the nerve to be ungrateful. To tell me I‚Äôm not doing enough.

I was about to tell her off. Tell her that she needs to have some patience and that I‚Äôm her husband and I deserve respect. But my thoughts were interrupted by a loud banging sound outside. My wife and daughter stopped and stared at the backdoor with wide fearful eyes. They were deer in headlights, waiting for a car to crash through our house. When nothing came, they slowly went back to how they were. She continued to stir her soup, my daughter went back to her homework, and I just sat at the dining room table. I took a breath and tried to calm down. I was too exhausted to have another fight.

Wordlessly, I went to go sit in the living room. My daughter still didn‚Äôt greet me. She wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge me at all. But she knew I was there. I could tell. She was tense. Nervous. She acted like a bomb just sat right beside her.

‚ÄúHey, kiddo!‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, dad‚Äù, she said quietly. As if anything louder might make me explode.

‚ÄúWhatcha working on?‚Äù I asked with as much enthusiasm I could muster, hoping she would match it.

‚ÄúSchool work‚Äù she replied, dryly.

She was a whole other issue. She had gone quiet a while back. Disconnected herself. Gone were the days of ‚ÄòDaddy‚Äôs little girl‚Äô. Now she was a stranger, who was afraid of me. I guess that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre the ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô too many times.

‚ÄúCan you give me more than a couple words, sweetheart? I missed you at work today, and I‚Äôd love to talk to you‚Äù

She was frozen. Afraid to look up. Afraid to look at me.

‚ÄúKiddo, I‚Äôm your dad. I just want to talk to you. I want to hear about school. Or your hobbies. Or your friends.¬† Just, anything. Please?‚Äù

She was fighting back tears.

‚ÄúMay I go to my room?‚Äù she squeaked out in a near whisper.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, dropping my enthusiasm. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just talk to your old man? I‚Äôm your dad!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs had a long day and has a lot of homework. Just let her go to her room‚Äù my wife interrupted. ¬†

‚ÄúOh, so you get to know about her day, but I don't?¬† I‚Äôm not asking for much! I just want to talk to my daughter. Why won‚Äôt you talk to me!‚Äù

Another noise shook the house, much louder than the first. My daughter began to cry. My wife let out a yelp. I started to swear to myself as I went outside to figure out what all the noise was about.

¬†

When I came outside I found a man, standing by our trash bins. Garbage covered the driveway, apparently thrown around by the man. He was dressed like a factory worker. He wore a Carhartt shirt, jeans, and steel toe boots. The outfit looked like it could have been one of mine. He stood facing away from me. His hands were bloodied and swollen, like he just got through punching something.

‚ÄúIts not right you know.‚Äù, he said to me, still facing away.

‚ÄúWho the hell are you? Get the hell off my property.‚Äù

He ignored me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right, the way they treat you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a hard-working man. You‚Äôre an honest man. You work your ass off to give them a place to sleep. You buy them food to eat. And they don‚Äôt even care. They aren‚Äôt even grateful. So, what the hell are you even doing this for?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I love them.‚Äù I answered.

‚ÄúBut do they love you? Do they even like you? Do they even know you anymore? They don‚Äôt treat you like a husband or a father. They use you. They take everything you give them without a second thought and then stick their hands out and ask for more. And what do you get in return? Passive aggression and one-word answers. You give away all of your love and you get none in return.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true. Fuck you man. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. They love me. We‚Äôre just in a rough spot right now, that‚Äôs all‚Äù, I told him. My heart was beating out of my chest, threatening to burst with anger at the nerve of the stranger. ¬†But somewhere, deep down, I felt he was right. I did feel used. Unappreciated. Empty.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying to yourself. You‚Äôre letting yourself be deceived by them. She doesn‚Äôt love you anymore. She thinks you‚Äôre weak. Worthless. She asks for too much. How much are you expected to give her? You‚Äôve given all you have and it isn‚Äôt enough. You‚Äôre not enough for her. Hers, is a special kind of cruelty. Does it make your blood boil, that that parasite leeches off of you without a care for her host?

‚ÄúAnd your daughter. How endlessly frustrating. How much effort does it take? How much can you try, when she won‚Äôt even look at you. She‚Äôs scared of you, and for what? Trying to be a loving father? Trying to talk to his daughter? How many times do you have to roll that boulder up the hill before you realize that she doesn‚Äôt love you either. They hate you. They‚Äôre killing you. They pile the world onto your shoulders and hate that you fall under the weight.

They deserve to know how much you hurt.‚Äù

He turned to me and I saw his face.¬† He looked like a tired man, stretched too thin. Dark circles hung under his eyes. His hair was oily and unwashed. His mouth was dry with cracked lips. Every feature on his face was twisted in disgust. Hatred. Rage. His breathing was heavy. His hands shook with adrenaline. His eyes locked onto mine and I realized two things. He looked exactly like me and he was holding one of our kitchen knives.



I became stuck, completely unable to move. My doppelganger seemed to know this. He paid me no mind as he walked past me. I tried to run. I tried to move at all. But nothing happened. I was a passenger in my own body, with no control. He turned me, so I was facing my house. I was forced to stand there and watch it all unfold through the windows.

I saw him stomp up to my door and let himself inside, slamming the door back shut. I heard the man rampage through my house. He slammed the soup off the stove, letting the giant pot clatter loudly into the wall. My wife screamed my name. I struggled for control again, but I had none. I heard my own voice scream out in anger before my wife was stabbed. The sound of steel on bone pierced my ears. I saw her eyes. She gurgled in pain as her lungs filled with blood. I heard her ribs snap. All the while a voice like mine screamed incomprehensibly in a rage about love and patience and kindness.

I heard my daughter crying. I knew she was as frozen as I was. Powerless to stop what came next.

‚ÄúWHY WON‚ÄôT YOU JUST TALK TO ME?‚Äù my voice came from inside my house, muffled through the walls.

She suffered the same fate as her mother.

I was still frozen as the backdoor opened. He walked leisurely over to me. Blood spattered his shirt, it wicked wildly, rolling off the hydrophobic fabric and dripped onto the pavement. His arms were buried in raised scratch marks, defensive wounds from my wife fighting back. His steel toe boots were drenched in gore. It‚Äôs just too much. I can't remember anymore.

With a sardonic smile he got up close. I was powerless to stop him as he scratched my arms and rubbed my families blood onto my hands. He put his clothes on me, and mine on him. They were soaking wet and I began to shiver. He put the knife in my paralyzed hand, before stepping back and admiring his handy work. Satisfied, ¬†he flashed me a quick red smile, and then he was gone. When I regained control, I got in my car and ran away. 

He took them from me and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. If the police find me, its over. I‚Äôm done. They think I did that to them. I didn't. I couldn‚Äôt. Everyone has bad thoughts sometimes, but that‚Äôs not evidence. That‚Äôs not real. I‚Äôm not capable of that. But those fucking idiots won‚Äôt listen to me. It's not fair. I don't deserve this. I'm a good husband. I'm a good father. If I could just

You'd think in this day and age of fancy AI and algorithms, we'd have Skynet handling this. Or, maybe a more friendly bot...HAL is acceptable, as well. But alas, no. We're stuck with good old-fashioned human eyeballs for now. Apparently taking over the world and monitoring subreddits require different skill sets.

We're implementing a temporary ""auditing"" process (a term I totally borrowed from a friend who may or may not work for a certain three-letter agency that¬†loves¬†taxes). Think of it as a brief layover for your post at a secure, undisclosed location where it's being carefully examined by our dedicated team (who are probably fueled by lukewarm coffee and the sheer will to serve).

This just means there might be a slight delay before your post appears on the subreddit, likely lasting until this evening. We're anticipating an uptick in rule violations. We're doing this to ensure r/fednews remains a haven for productive discussion and not...well, you know...a dumpster fire.

Like, seriously. How the actual fuck did I end up here? I wake up every day, just trying to exist, maybe do my job, torture a few souls, burn a few cities‚Äîyou know, normal demon shit‚Äîand then out of nowhere, here comes this motherfucker.

The Doom Slayer. The bipedal blender set to ‚Äúmurder.‚Äù The angriest entity in the universe that somehow has no personality beyond ‚Äúkill everything‚Äù and ‚Äúgrunt occasionally.‚Äù

And I don‚Äôt get it. I truly don‚Äôt. Like, why the fuck is he so angry? Did Hell run over his dog? Did a demon fuck his wife? Did someone steal his lunch and now we‚Äôre all paying for it? Because, I swear to God, nobody naturally wakes up every morning with this much unfiltered, industrial-grade hatred in their bones.

And the worst part? He doesn‚Äôt even try. You ever play a game on easy mode, just running through, mindlessly slaughtering everything in your way without a second thought? Yeah. That‚Äôs his life. That‚Äôs our reality.

Like, let‚Äôs talk about his gear. Because it‚Äôs some absolute horseshit how he gets all of it.

First off, why the fuck do we just have his weapons lying around? Why? Who the fuck decided that? We literally have stations‚Äîactual, physical, floating stations‚Äîthat exist exclusively to give him more ammo. Like, ‚ÄúOh no, the Doom Slayer is running low on bullets! Quick, let‚Äôs hand-deliver him some more shotgun shells so he can vaporize our entire species even faster.‚Äù

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH US?

And don‚Äôt even get me started on the chainsaw fuel. I need someone to explain this shit to me. No, seriously, sit the fuck down and explain it. Because last time I checked, demons do not use chainsaws. It is not a demon thing. It is his thing. It is literally made for him. And yet, here we are, scattering perfectly usable gasoline canisters all over the battlefield like we‚Äôre trying to make it easier for him.

Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget how he gets health back. Because, of course, normal people use medicine or healing items. Not this psycho. No, he just butchers one of us and, boom, full health.

Excuse me, what? What??

That‚Äôs not how biology works! That‚Äôs not how anything works! If I punched a guy in the face right now, I wouldn‚Äôt suddenly feel better! But no, he can just split a dude‚Äôs skull in half, and his broken ribs magically fix themselves.

I saw him jump off a 40-foot ledge, land directly on a Cyberdemon‚Äôs head, stab it in the brain, and just keep fucking going. Didn‚Äôt even hesitate. Didn‚Äôt even react. Just kept moving like he was on his way to grab a cup of coffee.

Like, dude, are you even human? Do you have nerve endings? Do you feel anything?

And the Glory Kills. Holy shit. You ever seen a guy grab another guy‚Äôs jaw and just fucking tear it off like it was a loose shoelace? Because I have. And it happens every goddamn day.

I once watched him snap a Revenant‚Äôs spine in half and then beat another Revenant to death with it. He tore a Baron of Hell‚Äôs horn off and then jammed it through its own eye socket. That‚Äôs some horror movie shit. That‚Äôs not normal.

And you know what‚Äôs really fucked? He doesn‚Äôt even care. He doesn‚Äôt laugh, he doesn‚Äôt taunt, he doesn‚Äôt even take a second to admire his handiwork. He just moves on. Like he‚Äôs checking mundane chores off a list.
	‚Ä¢	Rip a guy in half? ‚úîÔ∏è
	‚Ä¢	Curb-stomp an Imp? ‚úîÔ∏è
	‚Ä¢	Turn a Cyberdemon into a fine red mist? ‚úîÔ∏è
	‚Ä¢	Punt a Cacodemon‚Äôs eyeball into orbit? ‚úîÔ∏è

All in a day‚Äôs work for the most miserable, rage-fueled asshole to ever exist.

And do you want to know the worst part? The absolute most soul-crushing, demoralizing part of all of this?

We keep fighting him.

Like, why? Why are we doing this?

Every single battle plan we make? Gone. Every demon we send at him? Vaporized. Every fortress, stronghold, and entire goddamn dimension we throw at him? Turned into rubble.

At this point, it‚Äôs not even a war. It‚Äôs a hobby for him.

You ever had a kid with a magnifying glass hover over an anthill? That‚Äôs what this is. We‚Äôre the ants. He‚Äôs the kid. And the sun? That‚Äôs his fucking shotgun.

And I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm so fucking tired.

I just wanted to live my little demon life, build some cool Hell architecture, maybe torture a soul or two on the weekends‚Äîyou know, normal shit. But no. Now I have to constantly look over my shoulder, wondering if today‚Äôs the day **I get turned into a pile of gore for no reason other than some asshole decided to wake up and choose maximum violence.

So, yeah. That‚Äôs my life. Thanks for coming to my fucking TED Talk. If you need me, I‚Äôll be hiding in a corner, praying to whatever god is left that maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîhe takes a single goddamn day off.

*U.S. Implements 25% tariffs on non-energy imports and 10% on energy imports*

The Executive Order implementing the U.S. Tariffs ties Mexico and Canada‚Äôs alleged failures to stem the flow of migrants without status into the United States and that the two countries, along with China, had failed to prevent fentanyl from being imported into the country. In particular, the Executive Order cites a[¬†FINTRAC report](https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/intel/operation/iso-osi-eng.pdf)¬†on laundering the proceeds of Illicit Synthetic Opioids to justify Canada as a national security threat to the U. S. and states that Canada has failed to ‚Äúdevote sufficient attention and resources‚Äù to stem the tide of illicit drugs into the U.S. Despite acknowledging that fentanyl entering the U.S. from Canada is ‚Äúmuch less‚Äù than Mexico, the Executive Order states that even small amounts of fentanyl can harm Americans.

The Executive Order imposed the following tariffs on products originating from the three countries that are entered into U.S. commerce beginning Tuesday, February 4, 2025 at 12:01 AM EST:

* 25% tariffs on non-energy imports of Canadian- and Mexican-origin;
* 10% tariffs on energy imports of Canadian and Mexican origin and
* 10% tariffs on imports of Chinese-origin goods.

The U.S. Tariffs will apply in addition to existing customs duties and anti-dumping/countervailing duties on goods being imported into the U. S.

Notably, the Executive Order includes a retaliation clause authorizing the imposition of additional tariffs in response to retaliatory measures implemented by Canada (‚Äú*Should Canada retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action*.‚Äù) The Executive Order states that¬†**no exclusions**¬†will be granted,¬†¬†**no drawback**¬†will be available, and imports from Canada or Mexico subject to the U.S. Tariffs will¬†**not be eligible**¬†for duty-free status under the current U.S.¬†*de minimis*¬†exemptions for low-value (less than USD 800) shipments.

**\*\*‚ÄúThey will violate the free trade agreement that the president and I along with our Mexican partner negotiated and signed a few years ago‚Äù ‚Äì referring to the United States Mexico Canada agreement (USMCA) that was drawn up largely at Trump‚Äôs behest after he tore up the previous North America free trade agreement (Nafta) during his first term as US president.""\*\*\***

*Canada‚Äôs countermeasures*

The Canada Tariffs were implemented, despite a months-long effort by the Government of Canada negotiating with the U.S. and¬†[committing to crackdown¬†](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/en/news/2136426/canada-launches-fentanyl-crackdown-to-convince-trump-tariffs-arent-necessary)on Canadian domestic drug manufacturing and announcing a CAD¬†[1.3 billion package](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2024/12/the-government-of-canadas-border-plan-significant-investments-to-strengthen-border-security-and-our-immigration-system.html)¬†to increase border security.

The Government of Canada is reported to be preparing aid packages for Canadian importers and exporters impacted by the U.S. Tariffs and Canadian Tariffs; however no official announcements have been made.

Canadian Parliament is currently prorogued until March 24, 2025 while the Liberal Party undertakes a leadership race to replacement current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau; however, the leader of the opposition is calling the House of Commons to be recalled in order to address the perceived economic crisis resulting from the U.S. Tariffs and the Canada Tariffs.

*Canada Tariffs: Questions & Answers*

**How has the Government of Canada responded to the U.S. Tariffs?**

Canada has implemented a ‚Äúsurtax‚Äù (a tariff) under the¬†*Customs Tariff*. The surtaxes target U.S. origin goods that are classified under the tariff items listed in the implementing legislation, an¬†[Order-In-Council.](https://orders-in-council.canada.ca/attachment.php?attach=46660&lang=en)

Canada will impose a 25% retaliatory tariff on $155 billion of U.S. exports in response to U.S. trade actions, which will be implemented in two stages:

* Immediate tariffs on $30 billion of U.S. goods starting Tuesday, February 4th, 2025; and
* additional tariffs on $125 billion of U.S. goods in 21 days to allow Canadian companies time to find alternatives.

The Government of Canada is also considering non-tariff measures alongside provincial premiers, including measures related to critical minerals, energy, procurement, and partnerships. Canadian provinces are announcing their own countermeasures. To date, British Columbia has directed the province and Crown corporations to buy Canadian goods and services and has directed the B.C. Liquor Distribution Branch to stop buying American liquor from stated with Republican political representation.¬† ¬†Nova Scotia has also committed to limiting accessing to provincial procurement for American business, is exploring termination clauses in existing procurement contracts with American businesses, will double the cost of tolls at Cobequid Pass and will direct the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation to removing all U.S. liquor from shelves as of February 4.

**What goods are targeted by the Canada Tariffs?**

Canadian tariffs apply to a wide variety of American origin goods, such as U.S. origin beer, wine, coffee, tea bourbon, fruit, fruit juices, vegetables, perfumes, shoes, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment, lumber, and plastics. The Order In Council implementing the Canada Tariff identifies goods by tariff item\*\*.\*\*¬†The entire list of tariff items is available[¬†here](https://orders-in-council.canada.ca/attachment.php?attach=46660&lang=en).

Targeted goods include tariff items within the following chapters of the¬†[Customs Tariff Schedule](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/trade-commerce/tariff-tarif/2025/html/tblmod-eng.html), Canada‚Äôs implementation of the harmonized system: Chapter 1, 2, 4, 7 to 25, 33, to 35, 39, 40, 42, 44, 47 to 49, 57, 61 to 65, 69 to 71, 73, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 93, and 94 to 97.

**Will more goods be added to the Canada Tariffs?**

It is possible that the Government of Canada will retaliate further if the U.S. increases the amount of the U.S. Tariffs from 25% on non-energy imports of Canadian origin and 10% of energy imports of Canadian origin. In his press conference on Saturday, February 1^(st), Prime Minister Trudeau has expressed that Canada does not desire escalation.

**If goods qualify for USMCA tariff treatment, do Canada Tariffs apply?**

Yes. Canada Tariffs apply to goods qualifying for USMCA preferential tariff treatment. In other words, U.S. origin goods can no longer be imported into Canada duty-free; a 25% tariff will apply.

**How will the Canada Tariffs be calculated on eligible imports?**

The Canada Tariffs will apply in addition to customs duties and anti-dumping/countervailing duties owing in respect of the goods. The Canada Tariffs should be calculated on the declared value for duty of the imported goods. Note that GST (at a rate of 5%) is paid on the¬†*duty-paid*¬†value of the goods. Accordingly, importers should expect increased GST liability on their imports.

If a U.S. origin good imported into Canada is valued at CAD 100 and CAD 10 in MFN duties are owing pursuant to the¬†*Customs Tariff*, the Canada Tariffs are calculated on CAD 100 (100 x 1..25 = 125). GST is calculated on the duty paid value (e.g. CAD 135 (CAD 100 VFD + CAD 10 MFN duties + CAD 25 Canada Tariff = CAD 135) at a rate of 5% on CAD 135.

**When do Canada‚Äôs tariffs/countermeasures come into force?**

The Canada Tariffs come into force in two stages: immediate tariffs will be implemented on $30 billion of US exports on Tuesday, February 4. Broader tariffs on $125 billion worth of US exports to be implemented in three weeks time (by February 22).

The Canada Tariff does not apply to goods that originate in the United States that are in transit to Canada on the day on which this Order comes into force.¬†Importers should retain proof that goods were in transit to Canada prior to the coming into force date (February 4, 2025). Proof may include, sales orders, purchase orders, shipping documents (for example, a through bill of lading (TBL)), report of entry documents, and cargo control documents.

**How is origin determined?**

Origin will be considered as those goods eligible to be marked as goods of the U.S. in accordance with the¬†[*Determination of Country of Origin for the Purposes of Marking Goods (CUSMA Countries) Regulations*](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-94-23).

An importer will have the burden of proof in claiming origin.

**Will the Canada Tariffs only apply to commercial goods?**

We expect that the Canada Tariffs will apply to both commercial and personal importations of goods, even when shipped to Canada from a country other than the U.S. However, a¬†[Customs Notice¬†](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/cn-ad/menu-eng.html)has¬†**not yet**¬†been posted confirming these details.

**Will there be an opportunity to seek a remission order from the Department of Finance?**

Typically, the Department of Finance will outline a discretionary remission process for Canadian importers affected by a surtax. A remission process was implemented most recently in Canada‚Äôs initiation of surtaxes against Chinese origin EVs, and steel, aluminum. See the requirements¬†[here](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/international-trade-finance-policy/process-requesting-remission-surtaxes-that-apply-on-certain-goods-china.html). However, the Executive Order does not provide for exceptions to the U.S. Tariffs. The Government of Canada has not yet made any representations regarding whether a remission order will be put in place. ¬†

**How long can I expect the Canada Tariffs to be in force?**

The Executive Order states the Secretary of Homeland Security, among others, shall inform the President of circumstances that indicate that the Government of Canada has ‚Äútaken adequate steps to alleviate this public health crisis though cooperative enforcement actions‚Äù and that upon the President determining that sufficient action has been taken, the U.S. Tariffs will be repealed.

We expect that once the U.S. Tariffs are repealed, Canada will respond accordingly and repeal the Canada Tariffs.

*Duty Mitigation & Risk Management*

North American businesses relying on cross-border manufacturing supply chains, where goods historically flowed freely between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, have been disrupted by the introduction of tariffs by the U.S. and countermeasures introduced by Canada and Mexico.

* Be confident in the¬†[tariff classification](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/trade-commerce/tariff-tarif/menu-eng.html), origin and¬†[valuation](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/import/valuation-valeur/customs-val-douane-eng.html)¬†of manufacturing inputs or final goods. Accurate determinations of classification, origin, and a declared value for duty allows a business to quickly compare their tariff classifications against the terms of a surtax order and determine whether goods are subject to surtaxes. Ensuring goods are properly valued (e.g., not overvalued) will allow a business to minimize duty impact.
* Review existing and future supplier and customer contracts, in particular, provisions referencing¬†[Incoterms¬†](https://iccwbo.org/business-solutions/incoterms-rules/incoterms-2020/)which are used to define obligations and apportion risk, including responsibility for customs clearance and payment of duties, in cross-border sales. Attention should also be paid to the scope of¬†*force majeure*¬†provisions, which may provide for termination rights for certain legislative action and termination and amending provisions. ¬†
* Consider re-structuring manufacturing supply chain to move origin-determining processes to a duty-effective location.
* Prepare financially. If a supply chain is at risk for tariffs, consider setting aside funds to pay increased duties and taxes (taxes are calculated on the duty-paid value of the goods when imported into Canada). Take the time to determine how tariffs may impact financial outcomes.
* Prepare government relations teams to meet with industry associations, key public officials, or consider engaging in conversations with key public officials (subject to applicable lobbying laws) if consultations are initiated, or a business seeks to take advantage of a remission order process ‚Äì discretionary relief for the payment of surtaxes or a refund of surtaxes already paid. See an example of Canada‚Äôs most recent remission order process in relation to Chinese surtaxes¬†[here](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/international-trade-finance-policy/process-requesting-remission-surtaxes-that-apply-on-certain-goods-china.html).
* Where possible, diversify suppliers (by jurisdiction) for key inputs. Redundancy, allowing for supply chain flexibility can be crucial. In doing so, consider the beneficial impact of Canada‚Äôs¬†[Free Trade Agreements](https://international.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/services/trade/agreements-negotiations/investment-agreements).
* While the Executive Order issued by the U.S. excludes the application of U.S. duty drawback programs in respect of the tariffs, the Government of Canada has yet to advise whether pre-existing Canadian duties relief programs will apply to the Canada Tariffs. Some pre-existing duties relief programs that¬†*may*¬†apply are as follows:
* [**Duty Relief Program**](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/dm-md/d7/d7-4-1-eng.html):¬†*Deferral*¬†of duties at importation on goods that will be exported either in the same condition or after being consumed, expended or used in the processing of other goods within four years.[**Duty Drawback Program**](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/dm-md/d7/d7-4-2-eng.html):¬†*Payment of duties on imported goods*, with opportunity to file a ‚Äúdrawback‚Äù claim (a refund of duties paid at the time of import) once goods are further processed, displayed/demonstrated, used for development or production (of other goods to be exported), or not otherwise used in Canada prior to their export.¬†[**Canadian Goods Abroad Program**](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/dm-md/d8/d8-2-1-eng.html):¬†*Partial duty relief*¬†for goods previously imported to Canada (duty paid), exported to another country for repair, additions, or other work and then re-exported to Canada.

# FEB. 2nd, 2025~Tariff Sticker Shock as U.S. Targets Canada and Mexico, Sparking Debate Over Impact on Critical Minerals Sector

[Technology Metals Report (01.31.2025): Tariff Sticker Shock as U.S. Targets Canada and Mexico, Sparking Debate Over Impact on Critical¬†Minerals¬†Sector](https://skillings.net/technology-metals-report-01-31-2025-tariff-sticker-shock-as-u-s-targets-canada-and-mexico-sparking-debate-over-impact-on-critical-minerals-sector/)

This past week in the critical minerals sector saw U.S. President Donald Trump¬†[announce](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg0m79gm10o)¬†a significant policy shift, imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico starting February 1. This decision is aimed at addressing issues related to trade deficits and could notably impact the trade of critical minerals between these nations. The new tariffs have stirred concerns in the industry, as Canada and Mexico have warned of possible reciprocal measures. This development poses potential challenges for U.S. industries reliant on imports of critical minerals from these countries, potentially escalating costs and disrupting supply chains.

In Europe, the automotive industry faces challenges from stringent EU emissions¬†[regulations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/business/tesla-chinese-carmakers-europe-emissions.html), which could benefit competitors like Tesla and Chinese carmakers by forcing European automakers to purchase expensive carbon credits. This scenario arises as the demand for electric vehicles in Europe declines amidst increased competition from China, leading to potential factory closures and job losses. The situation is further complicated by Tesla CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs vocal opposition to EU tariffs, adding to the European automotive sector‚Äôs regulatory and competitive pressures.

Lastly, the U.S. Geological Survey‚Äôs reluctance to classify uranium as a critical mineral despite its growing importance in nuclear energy is notable. Former President Donald Trump has¬†[suggested](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/nuclear-revival-puts-uranium-back-critical-spotlight-andy-home-2025-01-30/)¬†that this classification be reconsidered to facilitate federal support and streamline domestic project permitting. Uranium prices remain high due to a global resurgence in nuclear power and supply constraints, with significant production centered in Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia. This highlights the ongoing strategic importance of uranium in the context of global warming and national security, reflecting broader trends in the critical minerals sector.

# FEB. 1st, 2025~Reaction to Trump‚Äôs imposition of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China

[Reaction to Trump's imposition of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China - SRN News](https://srnnews.com/reaction-to-trumps-imposition-of-tariffs-on-mexico-canada-china/)

https://preview.redd.it/10j5hvp73qge1.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a399c7d969e50b983d7940e4d1d110d9e679bc8

(Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% on goods from China starting on Tuesday and declared that they would remain in place until a national emergency over the drug fentanyl and illegal immigration to the U.S. ends.

Following is a compilation of reaction to the development:

MATT BLUNT, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE POLICY COUNCIL, WHICH REPRESENTS FORD MOTOR, GENERAL MOTORS AND STELLANTIS:

‚ÄúWe continue to believe that vehicles and parts that meet the USMCA‚Äôs stringent domestic and regional content requirements should be exempt from the tariff increase. Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce.‚Äù

JOSH LIPSKY, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL‚ÄôS GEOECONOMICS CENTER:

‚ÄúMexico and Canada have a retaliation planned that‚Äôs unlike anything Trump saw the first time around,‚Äù he told Reuters. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure the administration is fully prepared for the backlash.

‚ÄúChina is breathing easy. They went from a 60% threat to a 10% they can manage through currency.‚Äù

MEXICO‚ÄôS RULING PARTY CONGRESSIONAL LEADER RICARDO MONREAL TO BROADCASTER MILENIO:

‚ÄúIt is one of the heaviest attacks Mexico has received in its independent history. It is not admissible, it cannot be accepted, a unilateral decision of such magnitude‚Ä¶. We are all going to lose, they will too.‚Äù

ROBERT MCNALLY, PRESIDENT OF CONSULTANCY RAPIDAN ENERGY GROUP:

‚ÄúThe President‚Äôs decision reflects both his determination to follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico and at the same time, a sensitivity to the risk of higher pump prices, especially in the Midwest.

‚ÄúThere is still the possibility that tariffs will not go into effect and negotiations on border security will succeed. If tariffs go into effect, Rapidan expects the costs, including possible retaliatory Canadian ones on oil exports, to be borne by Canadian crude producers, US refiners that depend on Canadian crude, and motorists who will pay more at the pump.‚Äù

LANA PAYNE, HEAD OF UNIFOR, WHICH REPRESENTS CANADIAN AUTOWORKERS:

‚ÄúAn attack of this magnitude, Canadians will demand that their government respond. I hope Americans understand right now that in Canada there‚Äôs a lot of anger. We are supposed to be the United States‚Äô closest ally, and folks are trying to wrap their heads around why this is happening.‚Äù

DAVID EBY, PREMIER OF BRITISH COLUMBIA:

‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs 25% tariffs are a complete betrayal of the historic bond between our countries and a declaration of economic war against a trusted ally. As British Columbians, and as Canadians, we will stand strong and united in the face of this unprecedented attack.‚Äù

ONTARIO PREMIER DOUG FORD:

‚ÄúCanada now has no choice but to hit back and hit back hard.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs Premier of Ontario, the federal government has my full support for a strong and forceful response that matches U.S. tariffs dollar for dollar. Canada has so much of what America needs: high-grade nickel and other critical minerals, energy and electricity, uranium, potash, aluminum. We need to maximize our points of leverage and use them to maximum effect. The federal government needs to also pursue every legal route to challenge these unfair, unjustified and illegal tariffs.‚Äù

CANADIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:

‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs profoundly disturbing decision to impose tariffs will have immediate and direct consequences on Canadian and American livelihoods. Tariffs will drastically increase the cost of everything for everyone.‚Äù

JOHN BOZZELLA, PRESIDENT OF THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION:

‚ÄúSeamless automotive trade in North America accounts for $300 billion in economic value. It not only keeps us globally competitive, it supports auto industry jobs, vehicle choice and vehicle affordability in America. We look forward to working with the administration on solutions that achieve the president‚Äôs goals and preserve a healthy, competitive auto industry in America.‚Äù

DAVID MCCALL, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STEEL WORKERS UNION:

‚ÄúThese tariffs don‚Äôt just hurt Canada. They threaten the stability of industries on both sides of the border.‚Äù

MATTEO CEURVELS, PRINCIPAL LATIN AMERICA ANALYST FOR EMARKETER:

The 25% tariff on Mexico threatened to upend three decades of trade integration, dampening retail growth and adding pressure on businesses. Mexico‚Äôs retail sales were expected to take a huge hit, growing just 3.3% this year instead of the 4.5% growth projected.

‚ÄúFor Claudia Sheinbaum, managing this economic rift will be one of the biggest tests of her presidency, as she balances the interests of Mexico‚Äôs key industries and consumers.‚Äù

UNIFOR, THE LARGEST PRIVATE SECTOR UNION IN CANADA REPRESENTING DETROIT THREE AUTOWORKERS:

‚ÄúCanada must hit back hard and fast as Trump declares economic war on Canadian workers.‚Äù

CHET THOMPSON, CEO OF THE AMERICAN FUEL & PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS:

‚ÄúAmerican refiners depend on crude oil from Canada and Mexico to produce the affordable, reliable fuels consumers count on every day. Some regions in our country also rely on Canadian refined products, like gasoline, diesel and heating oil. We are hopeful a resolution can be quickly reached with our North American neighbors so that crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals are removed from the tariff schedule before consumers feel the impact.‚Äù

TOM MADRECKI, VICE PRESIDENT OF SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY AT THE CONSUMER BRANDS ASSOCIATION:

‚ÄúAs the country‚Äôs largest domestic manufacturing sector by employment, supporting more than 22 million American jobs and contributing $2.5 trillion to the U.S. GDP, the consumer packaged goods industry supports a strategic ‚ÄòAmerica First Trade Policy‚Äô that protects American jobs and keeps food, beverage, household and personal care products affordable. Tariffs on all imported goods from Mexico and Canada ‚Äì especially on ingredients and inputs that aren‚Äôt available in the U.S. ‚Äì could lead to higher consumer prices and retaliation against U.S. exporters. Despite sourcing the vast majority of ingredients and inputs from U.S. farms, CPG companies depend on global supply chains for certain imports due to unique growing conditions and other limiting factors around the world. We urge leaders in Mexico and Canada to work with President Trump to protect consumers‚Äô access to affordable products and remove tariffs that could contribute to grocery inflation.‚Äù

NOVA SCOTIA PREMIER TIM HOUSTON:

‚ÄúFirst, Nova Scotia will limit access to provincial procurement for American businesses. We will look for opportunities to cancel existing contracts and will maintain the option to reject bids outright because of President Trump‚Äôs unlawful tariffs.

Second, the cost of tolls at the Cobequid Pass will double for commercial vehicles from the United States, effective February 3, 2025.

Finally, we will direct the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation to remove all alcohol from the United States from their shelves effective February 4, 2025.‚Äù

GERMAN AUTOS ASSOCIATION VDA

‚ÄúIncreasing geopolitical tensions and rampant protectionism are continuing to lead to companies having to serve the markets more and more locally ‚Ä¶ The exact effects will depend heavily on the respective situation.‚ÄØBut the fact is: sooner or later, isolationism will only have losers in all countries!‚ÄØ‚Äù

REP. SUZAN DELBENE OF WASHINGTON STATE, AND REP DON BEYER OF VIRGINIA, BOTH DEMOCRATS:

‚ÄúPresident Trump just started a trade war that will raise prices on American families and invite retaliation against American businesses, workers, and farmers. This is a tax on everyday goods that will hit the pocketbooks of middle-class families at the grocery store, the gas station, and the pharmacy counter.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a blatant abuse of executive power. No president should unilaterally be able to put in place these broad-based tariffs that will have far-reaching economic impacts in communities across the country.‚Äù

CLAYTON SEIGLE, SENIOR FELLOW FOR ENERGY SECURITY AT THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES IN WASHINGTON:

‚ÄúTariffs on Canadian and Mexican oil are at odds with President Trump‚Äôs stated desire for lower energy prices. They will increase costs for the U.S. refining industry, and American consumers and business will face higher prices for gasoline and diesel.

The tariffs will also undermine U.S. energy security; the 4 million barrel per day flow of crude oil from Canada is the most dependable of any trade in the global energy supply chain. The tariffs will cause Canadian producers of heavy oil to reduce output, raising the cost of substitute barrels that will come from more distant and, in some cases, less reliable suppliers.

Retaliatory measures by Canada will further disrupt U.S. flows and company earnings, especially if reciprocal tariffs are imposed on Canadian imports of refined products made in the United States.‚Äù

AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE:

‚ÄúEnergy markets are highly integrated, and free and fair trade across our borders is critical for delivering affordable, reliable energy to U.S. consumers. We will continue to work with the Trump administration on full exclusions that protect energy affordability for consumers, expand the nation‚Äôs energy advantage and support American jobs.‚Äù

# JAN 30th, 2025~How U.S. Tariffs on Canada Undermine U.S. Minerals Security

[(9) How U.S. Tariffs on Canada Undermine U.S. Minerals Security | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-us-tariffs-canada-undermine-minerals-security-jamie-hyland-iwekc/)

https://preview.redd.it/jef1vqlx0qge1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd2f41635cf966562f1dad98a7c8f2f6a53a8718

In an era where the United States is striving to reduce its dependence on China for critical minerals essential to energy, defense, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing sectors, imposing tariffs on Canadian mineral imports could be counterproductive. Canada stands as the largest supplier of minerals to the U.S., accounting for $47 billion of U.S. mineral imports in 2023, surpassing China's $28.3 billion.

In the past week, US President Donald Trump reiterated his intention to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, citing concerns over illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and trade imbalances. He stated, ""We may or may not. We're going to make that determination probably tonight,"" regarding the inclusion of Canadian oil in these tariffs.

As discussions around potential U.S. tariffs on Canadian mineral imports intensify, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made it clear that Canada will not hesitate to respond with retaliatory measures.

*""Whether it be back on Jan. 20th, on Feb. 1st or Feb. 15th as a Valentine‚Äôs Day present, or on April 1st or whenever, Canada will respond with retaliatory tariffs and prices for American consumers on just about everything will go up,""* Trudeau stated during a press conference in Ottawa.

The Prime Minister emphasized that such tariffs would hurt American consumers and businesses by driving up costs across multiple industries. *""We don‚Äôt think he wants that,""* referring to President Donald Trump, who has indicated his intent to reinstate trade barriers with Canada.

**Impact on the Defense Industry**

The defense sector heavily relies on minerals such as nickel and aluminum, predominantly sourced from Canada. Canada supplies approximately half of the United States' total nickel needs, which are vital for producing nickel alloys used in military applications, including jet engines and armored vehicles. Imposing a 25% tariff on Canadian nickel imports could lead U.S. companies to seek cheaper alternatives from countries like Indonesia, where Chinese mining companies dominate, thereby increasing U.S. reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains.

https://preview.redd.it/db155lu21qge1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=8302546634f0bab8e73ae1c8b61533f3c447a7df

**Threats to Nuclear Energy Expansion**

Uranium is the cornerstone of nuclear energy production. Canada is the world's second-largest producer and exporter of uranium, meeting approximately 25% of U.S. domestic demand. With Canadian uranium reserves being ten times larger than those of the U.S., tariffs could jeopardize the uranium supply at a time when the U.S. aims to expand its nuclear capabilities.

**Disruption in Heavy Manufacturing**

The U.S. and Canadian aluminum industries are deeply integrated. In 2021, over 75% of Canadian aluminum production was exported to the United States, while roughly half of U.S. downstream aluminum products were sent to Canada. A 25% tariff on Canadian aluminum imports would cost the U.S. aluminum industry approximately $2.2 billion, disrupting this integrated market and potentially leading to increased costs for consumers and manufacturers.

**Consequences of Retaliatory Tariffs**

Historically, Canada has responded to U.S. tariffs with retaliatory measures. In 2018 and 2020, following U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada imposed counter-tariffs on U.S. goods. If the U.S. proceeds with new tariffs, Canada is likely to respond similarly, further straining the supply chains and economic ties between the two nations.

**Conclusion**

Tariffs and minerals have long been intertwined in trade discussions. However, imposing tariffs on Canadian mineral imports at this juncture could undermine U.S. efforts to secure critical mineral supplies, inadvertently increasing dependence on Chinese-controlled sources. A collaborative approach with Canada, focusing on strengthening and securing supply chains, would better serve U.S. interests in energy, defense, and manufacturing sectors.

I tried looking around the internet for names of companies and found very little, so I'm hoping you can help me out.

I'm looking to move this summer from Germany (Bremen) to USA (New York).

I have an apartment of about 55m2 and as much as I would like to take it all, I know that it probably isn't worth it.  
Still, there are some things that I would REALLY like to take back with me.

So far, I got a quote from Upakweship - their 20ft containers are 8000‚Ç¨...my stuff is definitely not worth that much, lol.

Mostly what I am interested in taking back are two tables (coffee table size, one can be dismantled, the other is a chest which can also be used to store fragiles), two Persian rugs (about 2m x 1m), all of my towels, cutlery, plates, books, pictures, bedding, etc... things like that.

No appliances, no larger furniture pieces (if I could take my new couch, that would be great, but not for 8k, it only cost 800‚Ç¨). I will also have at least 1 checked-in suitcase available, maybe 1 or 2 more if my dad and friend will come to help me move.

Obviously looking for the cheapest and best way to move as much as possible. I know shipping via boat is cheaper and takes longer, which is not a problem.

I 25F have been in a relationship with Carter 29M. Our relationship has been nothing short of great, he is interesting although doesn't talk much, has never raised his voice, he does get mad but usually isolates himself when he does because he does not want to react in any way. He remembers every little detail about me (I am hella forgetful) and plans dates, events and overall makes me feel really comfortable, I don't know if this is important but he also comes from a pretty wealthy family and by wealthy like old money kind of wealth but he isn't really big on his family but loves mine so much that my parents usually joke that if we break up they are leaving with him and would abandon me, so no red flags so far as someone who always looks out for them.

Now the problem is a few days ago I was doing some cleaning when I saw a file carefully tucked away in his study. His study is a place I rarely go into not because of anything I just felt it's a place he likes to relax and work. In the file it contained pictures of me back to before we met two years ago, it had time stamps of my usual hangout spots, where I work, what my usual routine is down to where I live it was all documented but the dates and pictures stopped after we started dating. The crazy thing is we met at my usual coffee shop and I thought it was a complete coincidence, everywhere we met unofficially was related to places all documented in the file. He also had tabs on my hobbies which are now most of his hobbies and it left a sour taste in my mouth. 

I left the room and finished cleaning but I became really distant and uncomfortable around him which was kind of noticable but here is any thing. When he confronted me about it he said ""What did you see?"" The question caught me off guard because he remained the same, calm, collected and soft spoken. I told him of the file and asked him if he was stalking me and planned out entire meeting, he smiled and said yes because he felt like if he came the way he was as a totally boring person with no personality I wouldn't have been interested in him and I asked him why he thought so and he replied if I knew we had met before at a seminar where he made small talk with me around 3 years ago which of course I didn't and he proved his point but it was still creepy as hell

He told me I could stay in the house and think freely (it's his house by the way) and he left but he then sent me a message saying how he doesn't want to break up with me, he loves me and would do anything for me. He clearly said you can clear your thoughts but don't think about a break up because that is the only thing I can't give you 

So now I'm her wondering if I should break up with him. I really thought about ending things because it's low-key an obsession but I asked a couple of friends who said I would be the AH if I do it because everybody loves him and it's not like he has posed as a threat of any kind to me. 

So would I be the AH if I break up with him?",0,1738500396.0,AITAH,4,0.5,False

By the time all other testing and planning for surgery was finished she went for surgery to remove the tumour in the September but multiple pleural tumours were found. As they can't be removed she was staged at stage 4 but was luckily a candidate for immunotherapy treatment. Following surgery she had months of pain and two emergency hospital admissions due to pleural effusions, collapsed lung and a blood clot. Somehow she got well enough for treatment and is now  just over a year into her two years of  immunotherapy. 

Her oncologist and nurses are amazed at how well she is and how the tumours have responded, there has been no growth or spread. I'm struggling to know how to support her though as she just seems to have given up on doing anything over the past few months. She has itching from the treatment and immunotherapy induced hypothyroidism and has very little taste or interest in food. She basically only eats one type of breakfast cereal, build up milkshakes and chocolate/crisps. 

I know this makes her miserable as it would anyone. She doesn't want to go or do anything, I have stopped trying to get her to come to the shops or for a coffee. She had two dogs and uses them as an excuse. 

I miss how we used to laugh at things and how she used to be. There seems to be no enjoyment in her life and she says she's fine, just tired. I know she won't be open with me as she won't want to worry me but I know she isn't herself. 

I have asked if she would like a visit from her Macmillan nurse or a call from the hospice as she previously had support but she has said she's fine. It's breaking my heart watching her day after day sit watching daytime tv until she goes to bed early evening. If I ask if she's ok she gets defensive and just says she's tired or cold. 

We are in the UK, would it be wrong if I contact her MacMillan nurse this week to ask her for support even though she has said no? It just feels at the moment like cancer has already taken away her spirit and left her with nothing. ",2,1738499963.0,CancerFamilySupport,2,1.0,False
1ifwdlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ifwdlw/3_months_boundaries_and_not_understanding_anything/,"3 months, boundaries, and not understanding anything.","Me 30M and my ex 26F broke up 3 months ago. Week after the break up I left the country for two months. During that time i proposed not to speak any more and she broke no contact after 10 days. Since then we spoke every week or two about how we both felt and how was life going. 

One month ago i came back and started my life again in the same city but this time alone. We saw each other and spoke about what we both wanted. Myself I still love her and I set my boundaries. She instead said that she loves me but she can‚Äôt be in a relationship until she figures out how to be ok on her own. She is too codependent and in some way this hurts her and any relationship she could have. 

Since our first initial chat since I came back I have seen her more just to figure things out about our old apartment. I was gonna move into the apartment and she would leave because she couldn‚Äôt keep paying it on her own. So we had to see each other to change bills names and other unimportant stuff. But she always wanted to go out for coffee afterwards and keep hanging and chatting. 

About two weeks ago we started seeing each other more. Because of a friend in common. And with this we also start hanging out by ourselves. Called me to go for a walk, to have some coffee before work even watching a movie at her place. Nothing ever happened out of this. But once she gave me a jealousy treat about me going out and assuming that I was moving on with my life. 

For the last three days she had been moving her stuff out of the apartment so I helped her move out as well as she helped me to move in. I had seen some positive things from her part like calling me with our inside relationship nickname, looking for contact instead of just receiving it (hugs, holding hands, kisses in the cheeks). We spoke about our relationship and how she sees that her expectations around men are too high near impossible for someone to achieve and that I was 80% of all that she needs. But it‚Äôs still missing that 20% and that she knows that no one will ever be the perfect person for her. I said the same to her, that she was not my idolized partner. But was close enough and that‚Äôs why I wanted to be with her. And that that isn‚Äôt conforming or just set the bar lower. It‚Äôs the reality of the world. 

Last night after moving everything I told her what I really thought about her. That she has the potential to be the best woman ever but until then she will continue to do the same things. And that that‚Äôs why I wouldn‚Äôt (even if I really want to) get back with her. This kind of hurt her but is the truth. After that we went out to drink a couple of beers and she started to trying to make plans for us to go to a techno festival this summer. 

I had been honest about my feelings, about me and her. I set my boundaries saying we were not friends we are exes. She gave me her piece of mind about our old relationship. Jealousy, feelings hurt. And with all this she wants to keep hanging chatting or even make plans. 

I guess I‚Äôm just venting, or maybe I‚Äôm looking for answers for something that not even have an answer from strangers in the internet. But this is my story and my life at this point. I‚Äôm not even sad or worried. I would just like to understand her. To see if I could help her out.

It can destroy more than the liver even if you can avoid alcoholism.


Alcohol for myself has never really been a big deal. Since about the age of 16 my consumption of it ebbed and flowed like the tides. Quite manageable. I'd have periods where maybe I'd be a little heavier on the beer especially in the summer and periods where it would be like eh no thanks. 
My relatives on the other hand? You'd think my last name was synonyms with alcoholism.
My Grandfather lived to be almost 100 but much of his early life would go on day or week long benders (second hand information from family) he was once a big fan of that sour mash. My father and uncles many of them heavy drinkers. My brother an addict to the meth his son a victim of it (may God bless my poor nephew's soul)
All that being said I think most of my father a man who left when I was 10. Our relationship was never the best but towards the end I saw a man who had very lucrative and profitable business...a skill unlike many others in his trade. He was a master craftsman. He employed quite a few good people along with my brother and nephews.
Years of substance abuse finally caught up to him in 2020 and he had a heart attack, his business toppled for the most part. Having his profits drop down to a quarter without anyone in his realm to competently take reigns he and his wife (not my mother) who also heavily struggled with substance were forced to live in lower to lower standards to where by 2023 they would be staying in motels.
My father's wife died in 23' my dad went to more accelerated alcoholism as my other nephew told me he would drink almost daily. My cousin would speak to me and tell me he would he see my father walking up the side of the road asking for money. 
About 6 months ago after just getting home and settled in from the birth of my third child I get a call my dad is in the hospital.
They had him laid up in a bed with a ventilator shoved down his throat (from COPD). The doctor unsure of the exact causation had to keep him pumped in with all kinds of seditives as he would violently jerk from withdrawals. His body looked like a straw had been jammed in his back and 3/4 of him had been sucked out. Treated like an annoying crackhead that was a burden on the staff, they could fool many of my family and they did the best they could but ultimately I knew he wasn't going to make it and they were not going to limp him along. Seeing him like that his a burned image in my brain, he died before they could even pull the plug.. beat them to the punch.
Seeing all that since that day I never picked up a single drink.
Over the holidays a cousin bought me a bottle of one of my favorite liquors (barenj√§ger) I finally got it yesterday as the holidays were busy for me. I said what the hell, why not?
I poured myself a coffee cup of measured out 5.2 ounces about three shots while cooking supper. Got a head buzz and all but mostly felt loopy while trying to cook.
I woke up early this morning with my head in such pain like it felt in a vice, sick to my stomach, and just like shit. I had to run and puke my guts out. My wife ran into their asking me if I was alright as I was giving out toilet a hug. I usually workout in the mornings and do my tasks around my farm. I don't feel like doing a damn thing. 


Alcohol is bottles of literal fucking poison... Fruity flavored poison, or whatever your tastes are.
Using my own anecdotal assessments I can draw this from my life.

1. Those who age best and live the longest stay the fuck from it at some point.
2. Once you get past your early youth you feel much better and able to do more without it
3. It may or may not be ""manageable"" but you can very well find yourself having it creep up behind you with a knife.. again in my eyes the shit is ducking poison. 
4. The damage goes much farther than your own body 

Alot of those warnings from old timers or the religous feel dry and meaningless without the context. I hope this gives context.

I wish to assert control over my life and grant it to myself not the drink. I wish this for others.

Good morning everyone.

1ifw2vo,https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsyShopFeedback/comments/1ifw2vo/how_does_etsy_search_work/,How Does Etsy Search Work?,"Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key factors that influence Etsy search and how you can optimize your shop to rank higher.

# Keywords Are King

When a buyer types something into Etsy‚Äôs search bar, the platform matches their query to your listing‚Äôs:

* **Titles**
* **Tags**
* **Descriptions**

**Tips to Optimize:**

* Use specific, long-tail keywords (e.g., ‚Äúhandmade ceramic coffee mug‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmug‚Äù).
* Place your most important keywords at the beginning of your titles.
* Repeat relevant keywords naturally in your description, but avoid keyword stuffing.

# Relevance is Everything

Etsy‚Äôs algorithm checks how well your listing matches the buyer‚Äôs search intent.

* If a buyer searches for ‚Äúgold hoop earrings,‚Äù Etsy prioritizes listings with those exact keywords.
* Synonyms and broad categories (like ‚Äújewelry‚Äù) are considered, but exact matches rank higher.

# Listing Quality Score

Your listing gets a quality score based on how well it performs over time. Etsy looks at:

* **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Are buyers clicking on your listing?
* **Conversion Rate:** Are they buying once they visit?
* **Reviews:** Positive reviews help boost your score.

**Tips to Optimize:**

* Use bright, professional photos to improve your CTR.
* Write detailed descriptions that answer common buyer questions.
* Provide excellent customer service to get 5-star reviews.

# Recency Matters

Etsy gives new and recently updated listings a small boost in search rankings. This is to test their performance and gauge buyer interest.

**Tips to Optimize:**

* Regularly update your listings with new tags, photos, or descriptions.
* Relist sold-out products instead of creating entirely new listings.

# Shipping and Customer Experience

Etsy rewards shops that provide an exceptional customer experience. Factors that influence rankings include:

* Offering **free shipping** or competitive shipping rates.
* Having clear, detailed shop policies.
* Maintaining a high star rating.

# Personalization Plays a Role

Etsy personalizes search results based on the buyer‚Äôs:

* **Browsing History:** What they‚Äôve searched for or clicked on before.
* **Location:** Local results might rank higher for some searches.

This means two buyers searching for the same thing might see slightly different results!

# How to Track Your Search Performance

Use Etsy‚Äôs **Stats Dashboard** to see how buyers are finding your shop. Pay attention to:

* Your most popular keywords.
* Which listings are driving the most traffic.
* Where your traffic is coming from (Etsy search, ads, or external sources).

Etsy‚Äôs algorithm can feel tricky to navigate, but with the right keywords, strong photos, and consistent updates, you can improve your visibility over time.

key information from the article (rough translation)

There in the beginning, before Jonnali ""Noonie Bao"" Parmenius' career had taken off, Charli XCX used to send Noonie Bao encouraging messages.

- Every year she wrote the same thing. ""This is your year Noonie, I can feel it"". It became a funny thing we said to each other when everything felt slow.

- last year it was my turn to text her. I wrote ""This is definitely your year, Charli"".

- We wrote ""Apple"" at home in our apartment a little further away here on Ringv√§gen. I remember that we had a pretty strong vision and then we sat in each other's corners and vibed a little. We usually do that. Then you talk about the ideas that came up, sort of. The song was finished in a few hours.

And then it went viral on Tiktok, got its own dance, has been played 300 million times on Spotify and is now a Grammy nominee.

- Well, it's a bit weird when you think about it. The thing is ... I rarely look back on what I've done. Once a song is written, it's written. Then I want to move on to the next one.


On Ringv√§gen in S√∂dermalm, Stockholm. There, in a dirty garage that smells of motor oil and garbage, behind an anonymous security door, is Noonie Bao and Wiklund's studio, which has been visited by a number of world-class artists over the years.

The basement measures eight meters in ceiling height and is decorated with bookshelves, soft carpets, velvet curtains and warmly tinted lamps.

- The goal when you come down here is to feel at home, says Noonie while she puts on coffee. It will be so much easier then.


All the artists she has collaborated with over the years, Charli XCX is the one she has clicked with best. She describes her as a ""family member"".

- The more you know each other, the better it gets because you dare to be the worst. You dare to throw out lame ideas. The trick is that you have to dare - for the sake of the song.


Noonie Bao believes that Charli XCX's big breakthrough came only after her sixth album because she let go of what she could and could not write.

- It was about the lyrics. She dared to be self-disclosing in a completely new way. She wrote from the heart this time, without any filter.

""I think about it all the time"" as an example.

- It's about when she met my daughter for the first time and how she doubts whether or not to have children herself. Can you be a pop star and a mom? It feels like a completely new topic, which I haven't heard anyone sing about before.

Your daughter is two and a half today. Did you have the same doubts?

- Actually, no. But in LA, I've heard many female colleagues advised not to have children because ""you won't be able to stay in business"". Which is bullshit, of course, but still provocative.


In recent years, Noonie Bao and her partner Linus Wiklund have commuted between Stockholm and Los Angeles, where they now own a house. But now it's time for something else, she says.

- Things have started to cool down over there, partly because it has become so expensive to live there. No young musicians can afford to live anywhere. It makes the city feel less creative.

Instead, people go to Nashville, or Mexico City 

- I want them to go to the Ringv√§gen. It's my new mission. I actually think Stockholm can start happening again. We have fantastic songwriters and producers. Just here in S√∂der there is a studio in every other basement. As a city, Stockholm is extremely studio-dense.

Working from Stockholm is also a way to keep your feet on the ground, she explains.

- It will be a nice contrast to the music industry. I have met so many people who feel bad. Sitting here in the bubble on Ringv√§gen keeps you grounded.


Noonie Bao will also be at home in Stockholm on Sunday, when the Grammy Awards take place. DN's photographer Lars Lindqvist asks how she intends to follow the gala. Will she check with friends?

- I haven't actually thought about that. But thanks for the reminder, maybe I should. I want to get better at stopping and celebrating.",25,1738498541.0,popheads,1,0.97,False

Harrison Ford as ""The President"" James Marshall fighting terrorists onboard his flight. Committing acts of domestic violence (and then some!!) against terrorists over international waters using chairs, tables, phones, coffee mugs, broken glass! Wait, he does kill people with an smg! 

Gary Oldman as a Russian terrorist Egor Kurshunov, makes the perfect loose cannon. His forehead nerve popping Russian accent shows that this guy doesn't negotiate. Along with True Romance, Leon the Professional, Fifth Element this flick is one of his most memorable performances from the 90s!! 

THIS movie gets seldom celebrated or mentioned over the years, owing to it's silly, over the top premise. But Wolfgang Peterson's ""Presidential Die hard on a plane"" delivers!! This president, shoots, slides, flies and Punches in Bunches!! 

Taut action, tense gripping scenes paired with some amazing Jerry Goldsmith's score, makes sure you never run out of pure 90s cheese, hell, even the wires that Harrison cuts are Red, white and blue! Pure guilty pleasure. 

It was made in an era when flight action movies were celebrated, this one had American patriotism filled to the brim, paired with the now ""dated"" CGI. I ate it all up when I saw this in 2001! 

William H Macy, as the reluctant Major makes  such a good presence, Glenn Close looks hot, ‚ù§Ô∏è I keep forgetting she's trying to save the president bending conventional norms in the war room, juggling notes and powerwalking!! 

Speaking of distractingly beautiful women Wendy Crewson as The First Lady gives such a memorable performance! 

I keep saying, for an action movie with an over the top premise, this movie deserves better. 27 years and counting! An idealist President who'll F you up!! Let me know what you guys think?

1ifvz15,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1ifvz15/do_women_fall_in_blind_love_at_all/,Do women fall in blind love at all?,"I personally had 3 women in my life I could say I fell in blind love with, with about a 10 year interval. One at age 6, one at 15, and one at 27. I was painting them. I wrote songs and poetry about them and had romantic dreams. Those feelings were inspiring me to create, and also when I thought about ever having kids, I could imagine having them only with those women. They were so beautiful to me. And yeah to me they were pretty af but I was dating a literal miss Utah too (not one of those 3 kek) and I didn't feel anything close to what I felt when I REALLY was in love. 

None of the 3 ever loved me back choosing ""better options"", and also I look at the current perceived state of the dating market and it's so difficult to understand how to be loved. Like, even if I  had all the money and all success in the world, how is that even connected with someone falling in unconditional love with me? 

Do women even feel that kind of love? Not because ""he's from a good family and has a nice job and a social circle and runs a business"", but just because brain goes ""bro I don't care but here's a bunch of butterflies in the stomach and a coffee, sit down we recording a song about her eyes"". 

I'd think it was a teenage thing but I've had it at 27 lol. After our first date I LITERALLY saw her damn eyes for the entire night when I was closing my eyes. And yeah she just went back to her more expensive husband she divorsed earlier.

It feels like the whole social discussion about dating is about ""sex vs resources vs abuse, choose what you're ok with"", but like... blind fucking love. isn't that a thing anymore? I never see women talk about it. Do they even feel this?

Sorry this is so long but I'm curious what other people think of the topic. maybe share your personal stories or research/art, idc.

I have noticed some insane benefits like many people have posted in this community. Standouts for me personally have been:

* Increased energy. My energy levels are through the roof and this has allowed me to work full-time, go gym everyday and work on my side hustles. I am also more careful and selective about how I expend my energy.
* Increased fearlessness. I am jumping into challenges more willingly. For example in the gym with my lifts and doing hard tasks such as working after a tiring day at work. I play cricket recreationally and the other day my coach increased the speed of bowling drastically to 135kph and I didn't shy away from the challenge.
* Increased attraction from women. At my new workplace, I definitely get choosing signals and indicators of interest from women. I have had some what can I only call *odd* interactions with women. It felt like a couple of girls were intimidated by me and this is the first time this has happened in my life. I have always been known as an easy-going, laid back and kind person.
* Increased eye contact. This one is a classic which I feel comes from the lack of shame which I get from not engaging in PMO.
* Goal orientation. I am focussed on achieving my goals. I review daily and align all my actions towards achieving big goals I have set for 2025. These include getting my finances up, paying off debts, completing the first year of my postgraduate degree etc.

So anyway, regarding the coffee. I am trying to cut down on coffee and try to only drink 1-2 cups per day. However, some days when I'm just struggling to get things done like go gym or tidy my room, I get a latte from Costa in the afternoon. My energy levels are already high from SR but this just skyrockets my energy. I try to use it sparingly though as I'm really trying to get a good baseline of energy and wellbeing from being on SR.

Anyway, thank you for reading. I just wanted to share. God bless.",25,1738498316.0,Semenretention,12,0.9,False
