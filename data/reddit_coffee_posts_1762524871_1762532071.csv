1oqyk8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1oqyk8l/having_a_hard_time_eating_at_restaurants_weddings/,"Having a hard time eating at restaurants, weddings events","Hi! I have IBS-M although it tends to be more on the D side. I’ve learned through trial and error if I make homemade meals and stick a specific diet than for the most part I’m perfect! I stay away from high fodmaps control what I put in or don’t put in or foods I know I can tolerate. I discovered so many dairy free vegan products like cheese, butter, yogurt, cream cheese, milks (coconut, rice, hemp seed) that substitutes all the delicious food I used to love to eat without having a problem. I even make my own dairy free ice cream and it’s delicious! At a restaurant it’s impossible for me not to get sick with diarrhea stomach pain gas nausea. I’m allergic to shellfish and get reactions too with non-shellfish like salmon, swordfish, tuna, sushi etc. I’m allergic to tree nuts and peanuts soy as well. Then of course I can’t have dairy or fat like pizza at a restaurant, chicken Parmesan, anything deeply fried or smothered in fat. They don’t use vegan or dairy free products and I always felt they add more fat than needed. I usually end up getting just plain grilled chicken nothing on it a salad no dressing. At a wedding or party at a venue it’s also hard to eat because it’s pretty much the same thing.  I’m naturally very thin so because I’m not eating or eat very blandly people think I have an eating disorder or have a problem with food which I do but it’s because I don’t want diarrhea but of course it’s embarrassing to say. I can’t have dessert or even coffee it’s just so hard to go out. I did find and use an IBS friendly coffee brand that I do well with but of course also a restaurant or say Starbucks won’t have it. Also my IBS d acts up especially during my menstrual cycle so I avoid resturant food altogether, but unfortunately if I get invited out, have an event to go to, go on a date it’s to hard to say I can’t eat because I’m on my period and have IBS and could get diarrhea if I eat that. It’s so hard and was wondering if anyone else has this problem or recommendations? ",1,1762531950.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

As the title suggests, I (18f) recently just prepared for an event in my college as a part of a society. On the event day when we were setting up the venue, I decided to take a break to get some coffee before resuming my work, which was when my friend (16f) asked to help her buy a drink too. At first, i mean, logically speaking, you would assume “helping someone to buy a drink” implies that that person would pay you back, right? But after i got her her 12 dollar matcha she was like oh thank you so much for the drink. I was a bit taken aback, like what do you mean for the drink? My coffee was not even 7 dollars, and i would not even spend that much on myself.

So should i ask her to pay back, and if i do, how to do so? or should i just deem it as a treat for her just for this time?",1,1762531794.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I think these are sold on ebay, I bought a fox puzzle in the same style a few years back. But it wasn't as hard as this, I thought this would take me an afternoon but it took 4 days or so. I have to rearrange my lounge room so I can see the TV from my table, until I do that i only have my coffee table so I thought I'd do a cute, quick puzzle. Ha! It was verging into brain teaser territory & it only came with a palm sized image on the box lid. There was so much blue referring to the box only helped a little, I colour & shape matched for most of it. It was a little bit frustrating as all the pieces don't lock together, the antenna aren't attached at all. Slight bump made the whole puzzle go wonky.

Glad it is done & i am definitely feeling more confident about doing one of my tougher 1000 piece puzzles or maybe even a 2000 piece next. I will see what puzzle calls to me next time I'm shopping my stash.",2,1762531711.0,jigsawpuzzlers,1,1.0,False

For those of you who moved away from your home country:

* What caught you off guard the most?
* Was it something you *liked* or something that was really hard to adjust to?
* Did your sense of “home” change, or do you feel like you live between places now?

When he was with me he claimed to have not moved on from his high school crush but after ending things he moved on from her and had a new crush saying he has ""found the one"". He says she ""understands his love for coffee, poetry, books...."". I've seen her, she's a pretty woman with dreams of grand love gestures, travelling the world and having a cozy family. I wish her the best but at the same time when I say that it pulls something in my heart.

I don't want to be the one cursing on a couple to not long last. I want to focus on myself, forget that he meant to me so much, work on things more important to me in my life, strengthen myself, go learn new things, travel around.

But there is this this feeling, so negative. I do not want him and his new girl to last. I want them to always be disturbed and stressed because of each other. I want them to suffer every second they are together. I want them to feel uneasy. I hope they don't spend a day in peace while they are together. I want every moment of them together to be tainted with negativity and unease. I curse them to give up their faith in love by the time they separate.

This is not me. I cannot be letting so much hatred in my head, at the end of the day it's me who is going to hurt. I still am hurting, unable to focus on bigger tasks in my life and just circling back to this emptiness.

GOd, I am so grateful for my life and the blessings you have given me. The memories I am making and the things I get to feel and interact with. God, the life is better than I could have ever asked for. I do not know if I deserve this, but all I can do is just continue to be grateful for it becasue even the gratitude is an emotion that fills me with glee and I am standing here stark naked under the sheets and covers of my bed so comfortable and excited for the weeks and days ahead and my goodness what a life you have given me that I get to exist in this floating state of happiness on this amazing friday that is today. ""

  
Now, I hope you feel that way tonight.

  
But, lets break into the news today for a while shall we.

  
And you may ask, how is this related to finding a path, but form my data collection standpoint on this fourm that is becoming my favorite subreddit bcause for so long my subreddits was only used for porn ignition, but now, I am seeing that many lost folks are in the same place as me. The same age. I might even assume you all played minecraft. I might assume we are that Gen z spice. 

  
But, I imagine it is my age group that is posting on here and asking for help, while people decades older prob just 30-40 are reading, and even commenting. Very cool. 

  
Now, my writing is not outside of finding a path. This writing currently is taking place at my college library where my wife is working and I am doing my best as an umemployed porn addict to try and quest her back for her heart through al lthe trials and tribulations that come from the same narrative as Free guy but I failed it and from some one who believe sin god and the CHRUCH!@! and is afriad of dantes inferno at times to the point where I am like HOLY HELL GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE I GOT TO GO AND DISAPPEAR BECAUSE ITS COMING!!!

  
talk about finding a path. I have found a paht fo delusional optimism espically when I drink water and consume water and make my path the path of water which could not happen without water.

  
have you seen dr pepper and iced coffee? They dont flow like water flows. They have grounds and syrups that would get stuck in pipes of my body, so how well could i find a path the way water finds paths if I was not drinking water.

  
That took me forever to discover and I still am seeing how great life is the more water I dirnk.

  
By the way happy  friday human, we are in scoripio right now which is the element of water..

  
Now, speaking of paths, narrative,s life and friday.

Speaking of weeks, weekends and our age groups and paths.

  
DId yall play runescape?

Remember in the desert area where down where  you mine gold that scoripion is there guarding it so your combat has to be high enough for it to ignore you to mine gold without it bothering you? Remember the soundtrack.

  
The scorpion is scoripio. Its the water element. IT guards the gold. Drink the water and get the gold. Drink the water and level up your combat level so bears and insects dont attack you and you can mine in peace and go make all the jewelery in the world to match all the gems you mined from the coal, iron, copper and tin to get your minning to level 40 to begin with. 

  
Speaking of paths, you were outside and on a pc. Walking around, talking and then on the intenet. Speaking of paths.

Irgnore my connections, I am trying to find a path in my thinking and writing.

Not in a “cool” way, but because I got tired of things looking nice online and feeling cheap in person.  
So I started exploring, and a few of them completely won me over.

Son de Flor  
Their linen dresses are like comfort in clothing form. I wear one when I don’t want to think too much but still want to look put together. It’s structured but flowy, and somehow it just gets softer every time I wash it. It reminds me a lot of that “cottagecore” aesthetic, but in simple way.

Studio Nicholson  
This one is a bit more clean, minimal, slightly androgynous. I got a pair of trousers from them that feel almost tailored but still casual enough for everyday wear. They’re one of those brands that do everything right, good fabric, good proportions, no logos, no fuss.

Bradic  
I found them by accident. They make made-to-measure pieces in, limited runs, and everything’s handcrafted. I ordered a silk slip first, and it’s still my favorite piece of clothing I own. It fits perfectly without digging anywhere, and the silk has soft weight that just drapes beautifully. I later got a cashmere cardigan from them , and it’s the same story.

Sezane

A bit more artsy and playful, but still minimal. They use eco-dyed fabrics and often collaborate with independent artists for prints. Their knitwear has lived-in texture that makes even simple shapes feel interesting.

  
I don’t get that immediate “new clothes” rush anymore, instead I get pieces that last and make me comfortable every single time I wear them.

If you’ve found smaller or lesser-known brands that actually deliver on quality, I’d love to hear. It feels nice to find clothes that are made with care, in a world where everything is disposable.",2,1762531054.0,womensfashion,0,1.0,False

If you can name all the Hogwarts houses and pack a carry-on like a pro, we might just get along.

I live in Manila with six wildly charming dogs—yes, they’re all named after Harry Potter characters (points if you guess which ones). Life with them is never boring, and neither is my passport—travel is my passion, whether it’s a weekend discovering hidden corners of the Philippines or a long-haul flight to a far-off adventure.

I’m a bookworm at heart (fantasy and adventure especially), and I’ll always make time to re-read my favorite series. Movies are another love—anything from old-school classics to the newest releases. Bonus points if you’re into movie marathons and spontaneous cinema nights.

Music feeds my soul, especially live concerts. There's something magical about hearing your favorite song with a crowd that loves it just as much. I’m always on the lookout for new sounds, local gigs, or big shows worth flying to.

I love her, I want to be with her, but I just feel utterly disrespected. What do I do next?","Hi all, want some advice, me and my girlfriend have been together for 8 months and genuinely she’s been the best thing that’s happened to me in years, she’s funny, beautiful, intelligent, caring and she’s basically my perfect woman.

Over the course of the relationship she’s never disclosed to me who her ex (of seven years) was (past is the past) but I came across a guy on her insta (tagged in her profile, I was just scrolling her photos) about 3/4 months ago and asked whether or not it was him (she said no, just a friend, I accepted this and moved on). Anyway, fast forward to now I saw even more stuff online attaching the two together in a way that represented more than just a “friendship” so I asked her the question again and she outright told me no.

Fast forward, I find out more as I went digging (shouldn’t have but stuff didn’t add up and the brain tries to protect itself) and it turns out the man in question was indeed her ex, and after an argument with me last weekend she went and met up with him & his sister for a coffee in the morning and then beers and wings in the afternoon. I don’t suspect anything inappropriate happened but the whole thing has made me feel uneasy.

She lied and fabricated so many stories to protect the history of what this man was to her and the only point she actually caved and admitted the truth was when the evidence was genuinely irrefutable. 

We’re long distance, I’m in the UK & she’s in the US, but it’s genuinely got me wondering if I can trust her and does this woman respect me?

I worry that perhaps I am just being insecure, I don’t love the idea of the person I’m with being in contact with their ex generally unless necessary for logistics or shared responsibilities but I feel that if they are, they should at least be as transparent with you possible about who they are and what they are doing? Allow you the chance to have a discussion at the very least?

1oqy01k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1oqy01k/story_from_a_woman_in_the_trades/,Story from a woman in the trades,"It just got to me today an I just need to get this off my chest.

I'm a 34 y/o women working in the trades. In my 2nd year as an apprentice electrician. I made a career change from teaching for 8 years. So to be clear, going from a very female dominated field to male dominated. And its everything you would expect/hear about working with men in the trades. Racist jokes, sexist/misogynistic jokes, homophobic jokes- SO many homophobic jokes. The bigotry and hateful rhetoric is so consistent its honestly exhausting to just listen to. I wasnt really holding out hope that it would be better. But some days it just really wears me down. Maybe thats a fault of my own mental resilience, or conviction in choosing this career path. Who knows? 

Today we were drinking coffee while the general foreman and more experienced journeymen talked about the job calls we had to get done today. I don't contribute a lot to these conversations being a lowly apprentice but I like to pipe up here and there to show i am listening and paying attention. I make a statement about who was present my first day at this shop. A few challenge what I said (not aggressively but still) and we go back and forth ""he was already laid off"" ""no you were on vacation, and I had already been here a week"" blah blah whatever. Then another 2nd year say THE EXACT THING that I said. Changing 1-maybe 2- words in the entire statement, and everyone immediately accepted what he said as what actually happened.

Still up to this point I'm only mildly annoyed. I give everyone a hard time ""oh when I saw it no one believes me but when [male apprentice] say it you guys believe *him*  harhar, cope with joke, and move on. 

All of a sudden 1 of my general foreman snap. He's usually pretty soft spoken so it was out of the ordinary to hear him speak with this tone and everyone shuts up immediately. ""This is a stupid thing to argue about and i want you all to stop right now."" The other general foreman who is older says ""i think she was pointing out how they'll listen to a man and not a woman."" (Felt very conflicted here because he obviously thought this fact was hilarious but was the only one who really acknowledged what was happening.) First general foreman: ""I dont care. Its dumb. Its stupid. Its not worth arguing over and it needs to stop right now.""

THAT'S  what really ticked me off. Its a stupid thing to argue over? I think what you mean is that its a truth that makes you uncomfortable. Everyone was laughing. No one was actually butthurt or serious. And more than that, these men ""argue"" over stupid stuff EVERY DAY. 

There. I guess that's rant over. Idk. Its not like I expected these guys to be advocates of women's rights. Hell, I dont even really expect them to take me seriously. But to be completely shut down and silenced like that... it did not feel good. Definitely wasnt feeling the ""brotherhood"" that is supposed to be the integral part of this union that i felt so much at my last shop. Its a shame really but I guess thats just how it goes sometimes when you choose this kind of work.

Thanks for taking time to read this. I hope you have a nice weekend. TGIF

1oqxzni,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oqxzni/the_demon_that_lives_in_our_mountains_granted_me/,The demon that lives in our mountains granted me a wish. Now he’s come to collect it.,"The villagers say a demon in our mountains grants wishes, but not for free.

People here are all religious and superstitious. 

Our region is well known for its folklore legends. Beings, good or evil, that inhabit the mountains, valleys, or large forests.

My favorite is the story of the spirit called “Koziar”. A devil-like demon that resides in our mountains. 

He bears the look of a mountain goat, with yellow gazing eyes that see through your soul. 

His hooves clatter on the mountain rocks in a melody that sounds like the clicking of bones. 

Koziar hides his true self behind a charming, patient facade.

Soon, you would tell him all your darkest secrets and desires. He has the power to loosen anyone's tongue. 

The Koziar will then make you a proposition. He could make anything you wished come true. 

You wouldn’t have to give anything in return, but if you wanted your agreement to be overturned. He would silence you, blind you, and deafen you to the world.

Nearby, a king lived in a castle long ago. He didn’t have a fondness for criminals. Any minor crime would be punished in the way of the Koziar. 

Gouging your eyes, pulling your tongue out, and pouring molten wax into your ears. 

He would then send the criminals to wander.

The people from the surrounding villages would often find them still running in the mountains, making inhumane sounds. That’s how the legend of Koziar was born.

Not so long ago, I was at one of my neighbours' houses. We played cards and drank. The time passed so fast that I barely noticed the sun had gone down. 

I stood up, my whole world spun around, my vision blurred, and I started falling. 

We decided that it was time to put the bottle down. He helped me dress up, and I walked out of the front door.

I thought I had walked the distance to my house, but wherever I looked, I only saw dark and tall rocks. I stumbled upon a small path that led up into the mountain. 

I sat on one of the rocks nearby and decided to cool off for a second. I was about to get up, but then I heard some faint cluttering. 

It sounded like an ossuary choir playing the parts of their fallen comrades as instruments. 

The melodic cracking of bones, the legends talked about.

I looked up, and a mountain goat was standing above me. 

His hair was as dark as the night. His horns glowed under the starlight, and his eyes shone through the dark like sulfur. 

I jumped up. Cold sweat formed on my back, my feet started shivering, and I was breathing heavy.

“Hello, dear traveler, what are you doing all the way up here?” His voice was soft and soothing. My feet stopped shivering almost immediately, and I was able to catch my breath.

“You’re not real.” I whispered to myself.

“Oh, I’m real. Can’t you see me standing in front of you? Can’t you hear my voice speaking to you?”

I thought I was seeing things. I stood looking at it silently.

“I’m not an illusion, my friend, and I know you know I’m not one. I’ve been with you your whole life. Even if you didn’t know it.”

“I was deep inside of your heart, seeing all the troubles that you’ve experienced, all the misfortunes that the world laid on you.”

“I can see how you were not treated well again. You wanted to enjoy a simple night with your friend, drinking your favorite drink over a deck of cards, and your own brain and stomach decided to turn on you. Conspire against you. Let me help you, my friend.”

He tapped his hoof three times. A delicate sound echoed each time through the mountains.

My vision cleared, I regained my balance, my head stopped thumping, and my stomach felt fine again. 

Unfortunately, I was not drunk anymore, but I felt well again, almost like I hadn't drunk any alcohol.

“Who are you? Explain yourself!” I yelled out at that thing with confusion in my voice.

The creature standing on the rock mesmerized me. It made me feel like I was talking to a caring mother and the devil himself.

“You know who I am. You always knew who I was.”

“My name is unspeakable by the vocal cords, unwriteable in any human language, but the people in your village gave me a name long ago.”

“That name is Koziar, and perhaps you can tell that I already know your name, my dear friend, so no need to introduce yourself.”

“Thank you for helping.”

“No need for thank yous, my friend. I will gladly do anything to ease your troubles.”

I felt like I could trust him with anything. That he would fix all my misfortunes. I only had to tell him. 

“Please don’t hesitate. There’s no reason to. It’s only us standing here. You and me. Anything you need will be fixed.”

“There’s this woman I’m in love with. Her name is Hana. I’ve been in love with her for the past 40 years. Ever since we were children, I couldn’t take my eyes off her.” 

“She is and always was beautiful. Her eyes are blue as the mountain creek, her golden hair shines in the sun, and her skin is soft as the forest's moss.”

“She smiles like an angel, and her voice is like music to your ears.”

“Unfortunately, she’s married to another man. A carpenter from our village. He’s a good man. Everyone respects him, but I can’t. He took the love of my life from me.”

“Not a day passed by that I didn’t think of her.”

“What’s your wish then, my friend?”

“My wish is for her to fall in love with me.”

“Your wish shall be granted, but remember what happens if you decide to reverse it.” His voice now sounded rusted and crackling.

Koziar then got down on four legs, bleated, and quickly ran away.

I stood there for a moment, dazed like I woke up from a vivid dream. 

I didn’t know if what I saw was real.

When I walked into my living room, I hung my coat and went to bed, not even taking my clothes off.

Soon after, I was fast asleep, dreaming. 

My whole village was burning down, people were running around screaming, children, men, and women alike. Hana stood next to me. Her eyes glowed like the Koziars.

I screamed out for Koziar to take it all away, and then I woke up in complete darkness. I couldn’t see, hear, or speak. 

I tried to feel around myself, but there was nothing around. I tried to run, but the ground turned to mud and I kept falling.

I woke up in a pool of sweat. A fading sound of hooves knocking on rock echoed in my head. I could still feel the mud on my hands, but when I looked down, they were clean. 

I managed to calm myself down, but I still wasn’t sure if my encounter with the Koziar yesterday was a hallucination or reality.

I was eating lunch in my kitchen when I heard loud and frantic knocking at the door. One of my friends from the village was standing outside panting.

“Come. Hana’s husband died, and she’s asking for you. She won’t let anyone else comfort her.” He said, trying to catch his breath. I stood in the doorway, bewildered.

As we ran to their house, my neighbour explained that Hana’s husband didn’t wake up this morning. 

Hana hasn’t stopped crying since she found him, and she is asking for me and refusing any comforting from her sons or her mother.

When I came into the house, she immediately ran to me and tried to hug me.

She looked at me with her beautiful eyes, but I saw a shade of yellow glowing in that blue ocean. Her pupils bore a strange shape. I hesitated, but then I decided to embrace her.

I could feel her tears running down my shoulder, but the longer I held her, the more she calmed down. Soon after, she stopped crying.

I held onto her tighter, and she tightened her squeeze back. 

Was this the work of the Koziar? Did he make my wish come true? Was I not dreaming last night? 

Either way, Hana stood here now, with a look of love in her face.

When she let go, she was smiling with that beautiful smile of hers, holding onto my hands. 

I looked around me. Her family and other townsfolk standing in the room were staring at us in bewilderment and concern. I could feel their eyes stabbing through me.

One of Hana's sons thanked me for helping them, but said that they would like to resolve this matter privately. 

Hana started protesting, but her mother dragged her away to the other room.

I walked out the door, trying not to stare at anybody so that I wouldn’t have to see the disapproving looks in their eyes.

I felt the warmth rise and fall over my body. I felt bad for what her family had to go through, but did it really matter? Hana was mine now.

Warnings of Koziar were forgotten. The idea that this unbelievable reality, this gift he blessed me with, could somehow turn against me was not possible.

I woke up early the next morning. I looked out the window, rubbing my eyes, but the sun was not rising yet. I could remember a strange noise waking me up, but I couldn’t hear anything now.

I was about to go back to sleep, but then I heard it again, a faint knock on the door. 

I opened them, and on the other side stood Hana. Her whole face lit up.

“What are you doing here?”

“I couldn’t wait to see you, my love.” She pushed the door open and hugged me. Hugged me the same way she did the day before.

She felt warm, her hair smelled like I remembered, and I could feel her body pushing against mine.

We stayed like this for a few minutes. I told her to come inside.

I took her hand and sat her at my kitchen table. She watched my every move with that loving gaze as I fixed us coffee.

“My family was against my decision. They didn’t want me to come here to you, but I rebelled. I knew I had to rebel.”

She kissed and embraced me.

The evening came, and Hana realised she didn’t have any clothing for the next day. I was an old bachelor, and I had given out all the clothing from my late mother.

“I’m afraid we have to go back to my old house, my love.”

“I’m afraid so too.”

We walked down to her house, and Hana knocked. Her son opened the door. For a second, he had a look of relief, until he saw me standing behind Hana. 

They argued for a while. He didn’t want to let me in. Hana managed to persuade him, but he said I couldn’t go any further than the kitchen. 

We decided to agree on this. Hana said she would soon be back and ran into her old bedroom.

While I was waiting for Hana, her other son came out of his room. Once he saw me standing in their kitchen, he froze for a second. His face twisted in anger.

“What is he doing here?!” He yelled at his younger brother.

His brother tried to answer his question, but before he could finish, he turned to me and started walking towards me.

“What have you done to our mother?! You put a spell on her, you goddamn devil!” He screamed out.

A feeling of dread filled my mind. Hana and his younger brother tried to tell him to stop, but he got closer and pushed me against the wall. 

He now stood before me, digging into my chest with his finger, screaming in my face.

I could see the tiredness in his eyes, the big black bags under them. His breath smelled, and he looked unclean. 

He didn’t have it in him to take care of himself now after his father's passing and his mother's departure.

He was screaming in my face, but in his eyes, I now saw more hurt than anger. For a second, I started feeling bad for him. I now felt like a perpetrator of all of his problems.  

“Maybe I should make Hana return and let the family grieve.” Quickly passed through my mind, but then I felt his fist strike my face.

I could feel my ears ringing, and an iron taste of blood formed in my mouth. A dull pain pulsated in my left temple.

My eyes quickly darted over the room. There was a pan sitting on the kitchen stove.

I picked it up and struck him over the head.

He fell to the ground. A pool of red blood poured out of his head. His eyes were open, but his stare was blank. The smell of iron filled the room. 

I murdered her child.

The pan had his blood on the back. I slowly dropped it on the floor.

The younger boy grabbed hold of his brother and tried to wake him back to life, but Hana rushed to my side, making sure I was okay.

He was screaming out his brother's name, shaking his lifeless body. 

Tears were pouring down his face as he hugged his brother's corpse. Whispering to him, calling to god to bring him back. I don’t think he was aware we were still in the kitchen.

His shirt was now soaked with blood. The cries turned into faint, quiet sobs.

I looked at Hana, but there were no tears. Only the usual look of love now mixed with concern.

I took her hand, and we ran. When we got to my house. I opened the door and sat down at my table, panting.

“Oh, how they hurt you, my love. Why would anyone want to harm such a sweet man like you?”

“Those evil men. I will never forgive either of them. Good thing you hurt that bastard. I’m proud of my strong and courageous man.”

I opened a bottle of brandy and sat down. With each drink, I started to realize what had happened. 

I have killed a man. My dream of Hana being mine has been fulfilled, but at what cost?

I didn’t feel bad for her husband dying, but I didn’t mean to bring death on her family by my own hand.

Hana didn’t talk much, while I continued to drink my problems away. 

I was glad she came to my rescue first, but her not being moved by her son's dying was unnatural.

She just sat there across from me, looking deep into my eyes with love, or at least what seemed like love.

She started humming a melody. One from my childhood that my mother used to sing before I went to bed. The drink slowly eased its way into my brain, and I started to relax. 

I could hear dogs barking from the village. They were louder today.

Somewhere in the distance, a mountain goat bleated.

I was almost falling asleep, but then I heard a strange noise.

I ignored it at first, but it kept getting louder. I thought I heard my name called out.

I looked out my window, and there was no one around, but every second the noise kept getting louder.

Now I was sure someone was calling for me. The ground thudded rhythmically.

I rushed to the window again and saw my entire village with fire torches coming to my house. I ran to the door and bolted it shut. Standing next to it, my legs shaking, trying to catch my breath.

I knew why they came.

A banging on the door echoed through the house.

“Come out, we will break the door down if we have to.” I didn’t answer.

“What’s going on, my love?” Hana whispered and came to my side.

The look of love was now gone from her eyes, and so was the blueness. They now glowed sulfurishy yellow. Her pupils deformed into square-like shapes.

She looked excited. Happy with her work.

I froze and stood next to the door in fear.

Then the second bang came. This time, I didn’t hesitate and quickly took off through the back door. My vision had blurred, I was breathing hard, trying to run as fast as I could.

I didn’t take Hana with me. Whatever she has become, it was not the woman I once loved.

For a second, I could hear thumping far in the distance, but as I ran into the forest, it slowly faded away.

The adrenaline stopped, and I realized how exhausted I was. I saw a cave going inside the mountain.

I fled into it, sat down, and wept.

“I want to take my wish back!” I yelled out.

The clattering of the hooves echoed through the cave. The darkness was pierced by two glowing yellow balls approaching closer.

A demonic voice spoke.

“Haven’t seen you in a while, my friend.”

“I told you everything comes with a price.” 

“I think you owe me something now.”

I don’t want to lose the friendship, but I also don’t know how to act normal after everything. I just want her back in my life—even if it means pretending everything’s the same, even if it means quietly loving her from afar.

Context:
I don’t even know how to start this without sounding like I’m going through a midlife crisis at 17, but here we are. (Story time is going to be long, btw)

So ayun na nga. My best friend confessed that she developed feelings for me. Like actual feelings. Months na raw pala niya tinatago kasi she didn’t want to ruin our friendship (which, let’s be real, was already hanging by a thread thanks to my emotionally constipated self).

She told me she realized it when I was busy reviewing for my exam. Akala raw niya mawawala ‘yong feelings once things got busy, pero when life started feeling “normal” again, she realized it never left.
And when she said that, I swear I felt my soul leave my body. Because I cried. Like, ugly cried. Yung tipong hagulgol-level breakdown kahit technically wala naman kaming “relationship” to begin with. But I didn’t cry because I pitied her—I cried because I didn’t know she carried that alone. All this time, I thought we were fine. Apparently, she wasn’t.

Now here’s where it gets messier:
I have this long-running issue with people confessing to me and me pulling away. Like clockwork. Every time someone catches feelings, I panic, overthink, then poof—I distance myself. I always tell myself it’s to “protect the friendship,” but now I’m starting to think I was just protecting myself from feeling something back. And now that it’s my best friend—my emotional support animal in human form—everything feels different. Because when she confessed, I realized something I probably should’ve realized years ago: I think I’ve been in love with her all along.

Maybe that’s why I always prioritized her without question. Why I’d drop everything just to comfort her. Why I’d always think about her every day—like, literally every day. I’d be drinking coffee and suddenly, “I wonder she's doing right now. Is she okay? Is she hydrated?” Pero never ko naman siya mina-message nang ganiyan. 

During the first few months of our friendship, I actually found her attractive. Like, “wow-she’s-so-pretty-I-might-choke-on-air” kind of attractive. But syempre, I buried that thought so deep I could’ve built a whole time capsule around it. I did such a good job denying it, I ended up believing my own lies. 

But looking back now… I think I really did love her. I just didn’t recognize it because I kept insisting it was “just friendship.”

Now I’m terrified. Kasi after everything, I don’t know if I can still act normal around her. I’m scared I’ll start noticing every little thing about her again. I’m scared I’ll feel jealous when she tells me about other people she likes. I’m scared I’ll ruin whatever’s left of us just because I can’t figure out what to do with this realization.

And what hurts more? She said maybe we just need space to figure things out individually—that she’s still open to being friends again someday, when things feel lighter. I get that. I respect it. But it still feels like a breakup even if we were never together. Like… how do you mourn something that technically never even started? I miss her. Like, genuinely miss her. The kind of missing that sits in your chest like a weight.

And the irony? All those times I ran to her to rant about people confessing to me and how it “ruins” friendships—not knowing she was quietly holding her feelings for me all along.

Now I’m stuck here, trying to figure out if I should be proud for realizing this truth about myself, or if I should just crawl into a cave and stay there until the emotional damage fades.

I’ve tried distracting myself—studying, journaling, overanalyzing every text she’s ever sent like it’s a thesis, trying new hobbies. Nothing works. I’ve tried convincing myself that it’s just nostalgia. Still doesn’t work. And I’ve tried thinking, “maybe she’s better off without me.”

So yeah. I don’t really know what I’m asking for. Maybe just advice or stories from anyone who’s been in a similar situation.
1. How do you move forward when the person who knows you best is also the person you’re slowly realizing you’ve always loved?
2. How do you carry that love without letting it ruin the friendship that means the most to you?

Because honestly… I just want her back in my life.
Even if it means pretending everything’s the same.",1,1762530613.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False
1oqxye1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1oqxye1/how_do_i_stop_forcing_myself_into_doing_mode_and/,"How do I stop forcing myself into ""Doing Mode"" and finally embrace ""Non-Doing"" to beat my anxiety? (Based on the ""Top 1%"" Mindfulness secret)","I recently watched a fantastic video (link attached) on mindfulness that hit me with a huge reality check. The speaker argued that our constant need to be busy—our ""doing mode""—is the core cause of modern anxiety, stress, and emotional numbness. They suggest the secret to mental control is embracing a state of **""Non-Doing""** or **""Being Mode.""**

My problem is: **My social conditioning is so strong that I feel guilty, anxious, or lazy the second I stop being productive.** I’m essentially running away from myself.

I'm looking for the simplest, most practical, step-by-step tips and examples from this community on how to unlearn the ""doing mode"" and actually practice ""being mode"" in day-to-day life.

# The Core Concepts I'm Struggling With:

The video highlighted three main shifts that I need help implementing:

# 1. Shifting from ""Monkey Mind"" to ""Anchor""

* **The Theory:** My mind is constantly running (the ""monkey mind""), always chasing the next task, or ruminating on the past. To stop it, I need to give it an **Anchor** (a physical sensation or simple reality) to focus on.
* **My Struggle/Example:** If I try to just ""sit and be,"" I last about 30 seconds before my brain bombards me with thoughts: *""You should be cleaning,"" ""Did you send that email?"" ""You forgot to call that person.""* I immediately lose the anchor and jump back to ""doing.""
* \*\*🙏 **Question:** What is the simplest **5-second anchor** you use when you feel the monkey mind take over? (e.g., specific breathing rhythm, feeling your feet on the floor, etc.)

# 2. Reversing the ""Doing is Normal"" Conditioning

* **The Theory:** Society has taught us that doing something all the time is normal, and sitting idle is abnormal. We need to unlearn this and accept that **non-doing is normal.**
* **My Struggle/Example:** When I see a free 30-minute block on my calendar, my first instinct is to fill it with ""productive"" activity, even if it's unnecessary (like sorting old files or doom-scrolling ""educational"" content). If I just sit, I feel like I'm failing.
* \*\*🙏 **Question:** What specific *unproductive* activity (or non-activity) have you successfully made **mandatory** in your routine? (e.g., 10 minutes of staring out the window, a 5-minute coffee break with zero phone/book/TV.)

# 3. Using ""Sensory Awareness"" to See the Present

* **The Theory:** We can train our senses to bring us back to the present moment. The video mentioned the **5-4-3-2-1** practice.
* **My Struggle/Example:** I've tried the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, but I often end up just *listing* the items (e.g., ""5 blue things... okay, done, next task!""). I'm rushing through the technique instead of *actually* seeing or feeling the items.
* \*\*🙏 **Question:** How do you move past the ""listing"" and truly *feel* the sensation? For instance, when *seeing* 5 things, what thought or reminder helps you actually appreciate the object instead of just checking a box?

Any advice, routines, or tiny, achievable steps would be massively appreciated! Thank you!

1oqxxw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1oqxxw4/exploring_changed_my_confidence_the_ultimate_life/,Exploring changed my confidence: the ultimate life hack no one on TikTok talks about,"Most people think confidence comes from achievements. A better job. Hotter body. Perfect skin. But here’s something no one tells you: confidence can also come from simply exploring. New places. New conversations. New ideas. Not in a “go on vacation and find yourself” kind of way, but in small, intentional ways that expand your world. The irony? Platforms like TikTok and Instagram are flooded with fake swagger from people who’ve never left their comfort zones. They sell you “confidence” through aesthetics, not experience.

This post is for those who feel stuck, unsure, or socially anxious. This isn’t magic. It’s neuroscience and lived reality. These tips are pulled from legit sources: top-tier psychology books, neuroscience research, and some of the smartest voices in podcasts and documentaries. Most people don’t lack confidence because they’re broken. They just haven’t trained it like a muscle. And exploringyes, even something smallcan be that training.

Here’s how exploring your environment, ideas, and identity wires real confidence into your brain:

\- Travel forces your brain to form new pathways. Dr. Andrew Huberman from Stanford has explained on his podcast that neuroplasticity increases when you’re in a novel environment. Walking new streets. Navigating a new subway system. Ordering food in a different language. Your brain is suddenly alert, engaged, and learning. That’s where confidence growsnot from repeating the same patterns, but from successfully adapting to new ones.

\- A study published in Nature Neuroscience found that novelty activates dopamine release. Dopamine, aka the motivation molecule, is directly tied to enthusiasm and confidence. Even micro-explorations, like taking a new route home or switching up your daily routine, can boost your mental state and help you feel more capable.

\- ""The Confidence Code"" by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman dives deep into how confidence isn’t something you’re born with. It’s built through action. Especially risk-taking. They emphasize over and over: action builds confidence more than reflection ever will. Exploration is the perfect low-stakes training ground for risk-taking. Try something. Fail. Adjust. That’s the cycle.

\- Exposure therapyused heavily in CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) for anxietyliterally works by exploring uncomfortable situations again and again until they become normal. This isn't just useful for people diagnosed with anxiety. We all benefit from expanding our comfort zone. Small social risks, like starting a convo with a stranger at a bookstore or joining a local meetup, can rewire your sense of what’s “safe.” Over time, that’s confidence.

\- According to Dr. Carol Dweck, researcher behind the Growth Mindset framework, simply believing that you can grow through effort and exploration makes you do better. It’s not toxic positivity. It’s the belief that mistakes are part of the process. If you explore, you will make mistakes. But you’ll also gather evidence that you can handle them. That evidence is the core of real confidence.

\- A powerful insight from author and psychologist Dr. Susan David: emotional agility is built by confronting discomfort, not avoiding it. Exploring your emotions, journaling, sitting in silence, switching environments to process your thoughtsall of that builds inner sturdiness. That’s the confidence that doesn’t crack when life throws curveballs.

\- Podcasts like “The Art of Charm” and “Modern Wisdom” often talk about how adventure, unpredictability, and discomfort forge mental toughness. Confidence isn't generated when you're in control. It forms when you're out of control but still move forward. That's why solo travel, volunteering in new spaces, or even engaging with people outside your demographic can be confidence gold.

\- Most people live in algorithmic bubbles. They reinforce their existing beliefs, routines, and circles. Exploring forces you to pop that bubble. Read a book you’d normally never touch. Watch a YouTube doc from a totally different worldview. Talk to people older and younger than you. Curiosity expands self-awareness. And more self-awareness = more confidence, not less.

\- Reflect on this idea from “The Power of Moments” by Chip and Dan Heath: we remember peak moments, not average ones. Exploration creates more of those moments. That gives your memory bank more highlights to pull from when you're doubting yourself. You can't “remember” confidence into existence, but you CAN remember evidence you’ve done hard, new, awkward thingsand survived.

\- There’s also a physical element. Exploring nature, city streets, or even a new gym gets you moving. According to the American Psychological Association, regular movement enhances not just mood but self-perception. The body and the brain are not separated. How you move impacts how you think. So just walking somewhere unfamiliar can change your self-image.

Here’s what to do instead of watching one more “alpha tricks” video:

\- Do a “micro-explore” challenge. One new thing per day. That can be a new coffee shop, a different walking path, or calling someone you haven’t seen since high school.

\- Journal what you learned or felt after each new experience. Don’t just do, reflect. That’s how the muscle grows.

\- Set a “social risk” goal every week. Compliment a stranger. Ask a random question at an event. These are reps for your confidence muscle.

\- Create a “confidence bank” file. Anytime you do something new or scary, log it. That list becomes an antidote on low self-esteem days.

\- Re-read “The War of Art” by Steven Pressfield or listen to episode #129 of The Huberman Lab: both talk about resistance and how meaningful action feels hard but leads to growth. Exploration is hard. It’s also the path.

Confidence won’t come from thinking about it harder. Or faking it more convincingly. It’s not a personality trait. It’s a side effect of experience. And experience comes from exploration. Small. Uncomfortable. Unexpected. You don’t have to climb mountains or move to Bali. You just have to move consistently into the unknown.

That’s how it builds. And once it’s built, no one can take it away.",1,1762530573.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

1oqxvlh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqxvlh,(~$15k) DIY Halloween Wedding Breakdown,"Just wanted to share a breakdown of our DIY backyard Halloween wedding (non-traditional). Our goal was to stay under 10k, but we ended up closer to 15k. We are located in South Jersey and had 58 guests.

\-Photographer: $1484. We found her on facebook in a bridal page and feel so lucky, we love her so much. Her photography is beautiful, moody, and documentary style. She lives in PA but travels! We booked her for 4 hours for the wedding and she ended up bringing a helper who photographed background stuff AND had a super 8 camera (which we didn't book - she just added it for us, which was really awesome). She also included a 2-3 hour engagement session, which we did back in June. Since our wedding day was a halloween party, and we were all in costumes, we wanted some more traditional wedding photos. For our engagement session, I wore a little white dress and my husband wore a suit. We also did family photos this same day so that we wouldn't have to spend time on the day of the wedding doing them. Insta: palumbo.photograpy

\-Rentals: $1820. This included a 15'x40' tent, 61 black padded chairs, 11 tables, and a fill and chill table for our bartender. We also ended up renting 4 patio mushroom heaters from a guy on fb marketplace for $290 total (4 heaters with propane plus delivery). We added the heaters in the week before the wedding because it was going to be cold (high of 56 and windy, with the whole wedding outdoors).

\-Florals: $430. We bought almost all of our florals from Trader Joes ($340) and then rest from Produce Junction ($90). Two of my best friends helped the day before in setting up the following: my bouquet, a bouquet for my mom's chair, 7 skull centerpieces, 40 tiny bud vases, and the arch. They are so talented and it took 8 hours the day before and 3 days the morning of the wedding. I am truly so grateful for them and their hard work.

\-Catering: $2k. We ordered from our favorite Mediterranean restaurant (Norma's Mediterranean, they are amazing people). We definitely got way too much food and are still eating leftovers, but it was awesome and everyone loved it. They set up catering inside our kitchen while the ceremony was happening in the backyard. Guests served themselves, buffet style.

\-Bartender: $500. A friend of ours is a bartender in philly and we essentially asked what she would make on a halloween night and paid her a little more than that. We also set up a tip jar and her venmo QR code.



\-Helper: $250. The bartender's sibling helped us out for 3 hours. The wedding was at 5pm, and they arrived at 4pm for me to go over some stuff. They were the point person for the caterer, cleaned up any messes inside, emptied bathroom trash, and set up dessert. They were a HUGE help.

\-Alcohol, mixers, N/A drinks, lemons, limes, etc: $1400. We bought all of our alcohol at Costco and Total Wine (in Delaware - no tax). Our friends are heavy drinkers, so we wanted to make sure we had enough and we ended up buying way too much (like... we still have many handles of booze and boxes of wine lol). Our bartended ended up batching 3 cocktails before the wedding. The rest were mixed drinks, wine, prosecco, beer, and canned cocktails.

\-Porta-potty: $374. We have one bathroom inside of our home, and rented a porta-potty and handwashing station for outside. We know our guests well and knew this wasn't an issue (I know porta-potties are hotly debated on this sub lol).

\-Music: My husband is a teacher, so his school let us borrow their speakers/mics/mixing board. My friend and I made the playlist on Spotify. My friend helped with the mixer throughout the ceremony (transitioning between music and mics). People danced! You know your crowd best. We didn't need a DJ because we will dance anywhere lol.

\-Save the Dates/Invitations/Stamps: $305. I designed the Save the Dates and printed through Zazzle. I designed and printed the invitations through Canva.

\-Cake/Desserts: $230. We ordered three cakes from an Italian bakery in the city (Termini Bros) and then bought the rest (cookies and brownies) from Costco. We also had hot chocolate and coffee (a tea kettle for hot water and our coffee maker).

\-Charcuterie: $280. Everything was bought from Costco and Trader Joe's. Three of my friends helped cut the cheese the night before and then started assembling the board an hour before the ceremony. It was so beautiful and delicious, and once again we had way too much lol.

\-Paper/plastic products: $300. All of our plates, cups, and cutlery were plastic and bought from Amazon.

\-Tablecloths: $120. 11 black tablecloths we bought from Tablecloth Factory. I ended up ironing these a few days before the wedding and it truly almost broke me.

\-Pumpkins, mums, and cornstalks: $900. We had about 400 pumpkins, 500 corn stalks, and 50 mums. These were bought from Produce Junction and farms near us.

\-Decorations: \~1K. We started buying decorations the year before when Halloween stuff was on sale. We got a lot of stuff from Party City when they were closing. This truly could be closer to $2k, I don't even remember.

\-Wedding bands: $400. We both bought our wedding bands from Etsy for \~$200 each.

\-Makeup: $565. We both had our makeup done, as it was for Halloween costumes. Mine was $200 and his was $250. We tipped 20% and she had a $38 travel fee.

Hair: $250. This was for my hair trial, day of hair, and tip.

\-Uber vouchers: $95. We ended up purchasing $300 worth of Uber vouchers to give our guests $15 toward their rides home. People only ended up using $95 worth of them, but Uber only charges you as guests use them, and you get the rest of the money back.

Everything else: $2-3k Outfits/costumes, Lowes for all of the yard work ($$$) and decorations we built, extension cords, string lights, extra decorations, etc.

Having a wedding at your home is so much fun AND so much work. I am a very detailed and organized person. I had timelines, schedules, and to-do lists that were followed to a T and I still was running around until 20 minutes before the ceremony (literally, guests were arriving and my husband was like.. you need to stop and go get changed).

>A cozy romantasy full of charm, coffee, and unexpected sparks.

>Fake dating a grumpy shadowmancer wasn’t part of the business plan…and neither was falling in love.

>Three days after hexing her ex’s underwear drawer, Clove Morelli returns to the magical town of Willowmere with nothing but her grimoire, her sassy feline familiar, and a dream she’s finally ready to opening her very own enchanted coffee shop.

>The only problem? The charming old café she buys comes with a surprise tenant in the upstairs apartment—Thorne, a handsome and mysterious shadowmancer with scars, secrets, and no intention of moving out. But when her ex suddenly shows up in town, Clove blurts out a desperate she’s already moved on...with Thorne. Much to her shock, the reclusive mage agrees to play along—on one he gets to stay in the apartment, rent-free.

>Thorne goes above and beyond; working in her shop, taking her on a date to the pumpkin patch, and helping her develop new drinks for the upcoming Halloween Masquerade Ball. But as sparks fly between them over pumpkin-spiced lattes and shadow-drenched secrets, Clove begins to wonder if their fake romance might just be becoming all too real.

>Perfect for fans of small-town magic, grumpy-sunshine couples, and cozy vibes , Magic & Mochas is a heartwarming standalone novella full of charm, wit, and witchy wonder.

**Other Bingo Possibilities:** Published in 2025 (this is her *adult* debut, she has written YA novels as KS Gerlt, so unfortunately this is not HM), Cozy SFF, Self-Published or Small Press

Nakakaumay na pong makipagusap ng days sa Reddit tapos first meet and then di na umaabot ng one week ang interaction hahays. Paabutin man lang natin ng one month and above, chariz 🥲🤣

Free po ako tonight - we can go for dinner, coffee and whatever floats our boat afterwards (purely SFW po please, saka na ang bembangan pag close na tayo 🤭)

About Me: 
- Female
- Filipina (born and raised)
- Straight
- 28 years of age (almost trentahin na hahays)
- LPU Manila graduate, if it matters (viva pirata at magaling lumusong sa bahay, chos 🏴‍☠️)
- 50% Caviteña, 50% Makatizen
- Foodie adventurer 🍔🍝 (tirador ng bagong cafe and restos heehee)
- Film enthusiast and avid movie-goer 🍿🎥
- Huge fan of libraries, museums and art galleries 📚🖼️🎨

- Hindi red flag, cheater at ghoster 🤭

About You:
- Male
- No racial preference
- Straight
- 2 years younger until 5 years older than me.
- I don't care about your school and educational background 
- Around NCR sana, pero if keri mo pumunta sa Etivac or Metro Manila, gora 🤭
- Hopefully kavibes ko with the above, or at least masasakyan yung trip ko.
- Kind, respectful, charismatic, and have a great sense of humor.
- I'm hoping for someone na medyo extroverted yung personality. Someone who can bring me out of my shell and force me out of my comfort zone (in a good way, not a red flag kinda way 😅).
- You guessed it - hindi red flag, cheater at ghoster 🤭

If umabot ka sa puntong ito, almost beri gud ka na. Include HOORAY sa DM mo para date na tayo tonight, okie? 😁

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $500, US (+- 100)
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Absolutely, will probably need to at this price point.
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Ideally want to keep and upgrade for next \~4 years. Want good battery life for trips to coffee shop. Occasional travel so 16"" screen models are perhaps too large and heavy.
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Lighter is preferred but do not need ultrabook; laptop lives mostly at home with occasional trips to library/coffee shop.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 14"" - 15.6""
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Light CAD, don't really play games on PC.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** N/A
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** Backlit keyboard, Thunderbolt port, webcam, HDMI port, Ethernet port ideally
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** I don't do anything that requires mega power. I plan to boot Linux (do not need it pre-installed) and use this as a daily driver for light coding, home networking, 3D printing (light CAD use), and web use.

1oqxn9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1oqxn9b/when_is_the_best_time_to_drink_coffee_boost/,When is the Best Time to Drink Coffee: Boost Energy & Focus Daily,"**You probably rely on coffee to kickstart your day or power through afternoon slumps. But have you ever stopped to wonder if there’s a “best” time to drink coffee?**

Drinking it at the right moment can make a big difference in how energized and focused you feel. If you want to avoid the dreaded caffeine crash and get the most out of every cup, knowing when to sip could be a game-changer.

Keep reading to discover the ideal times to enjoy your coffee and how timing can boost your energy and well-being all day long.

# Optimal Coffee Timing

Coffee can boost energy and improve focus. But the time you drink it affects how well it works. Drinking coffee at the right time can give you a steady energy flow. It helps avoid jitters and crashes. Understanding your body’s natural rhythms can guide the best coffee timing.

Our body’s cortisol hormone naturally rises and falls during the day. Cortisol helps keep us alert without caffeine. Timing coffee to match cortisol levels makes caffeine more effective. Here is how to plan your coffee breaks for better energy.

# Morning Cortisol And Coffee

Cortisol peaks soon after waking up. This natural hormone helps you feel awake. Drinking coffee during this peak may reduce caffeine’s impact. Your body is already alert without caffeine.

Waiting an hour after waking allows cortisol to work first. Then coffee can add a stronger boost. This timing may prevent early caffeine tolerance. It also reduces the risk of feeling tired later.

# Mid-morning Boost

Mid-morning is a great time for coffee. Cortisol levels start to drop around this time. Drinking coffee now gives caffeine a bigger effect. It helps maintain energy and focus through late morning.

This coffee break can improve productivity and mood. It also avoids interfering with morning cortisol. The mid-morning boost supports your natural energy cycle well.

# Afternoon Energy Maintenance

Many people feel an energy dip after lunch. Afternoon coffee can help fight this slump. It improves alertness for the rest of the workday. Drinking coffee too late, though, might affect sleep.

Try to have your last coffee at least six hours before bedtime. This timing keeps your sleep cycle healthy. Afternoon coffee works best for steady energy without sleep problems.

# Benefits Of Delaying Coffee

Delaying your first cup of coffee can offer surprising benefits. Instead of reaching for coffee immediately after waking, waiting can align better with your body’s natural rhythms. This simple change may improve how caffeine works and help maintain steady energy levels throughout the day.

Understanding these benefits can help you enjoy coffee more effectively and avoid common pitfalls like energy crashes.

# Leveraging Natural Energy Cycles

Your body produces cortisol, a hormone that helps you feel alert naturally. Cortisol levels peak soon after waking up. Drinking coffee during this peak may reduce caffeine’s impact. Waiting until cortisol drops lets your body use its natural energy first. This timing supports a smoother and more balanced boost from coffee later.

# Maximizing Caffeine Effectiveness

Caffeine works best when your natural alertness is lower. Drinking coffee after cortisol levels fall makes caffeine feel stronger. This leads to a longer-lasting energy lift. It also reduces the chance of building a quick tolerance. Waiting helps you get the most out of every cup.

# Preventing Energy Crashes

Drinking coffee too early can cause a sharp energy drop later. When caffeine and cortisol effects end together, energy may crash. Delaying coffee separates these effects in time. This helps avoid sudden tiredness and keeps your energy more stable. A better energy flow means feeling productive longer.

# Coffee And Meal Timing

Coffee and meal timing play a big role in how your body reacts to caffeine. Drinking coffee around meals can change your energy levels and digestion. Understanding the best time to drink coffee with your meals helps you get the most benefits. Let’s explore different timings and their effects on your body.

# Drinking Coffee Before Meals

Having coffee before meals can boost alertness quickly. It may help reduce hunger and prevent overeating. Some people find that caffeine before eating improves focus. But drinking coffee on an empty stomach might cause stomach discomfort. It can increase acid and lead to heartburn in some cases.

# Advantages Of After-meal Coffee

Drinking coffee after meals is a common habit worldwide. It can help with digestion by stimulating stomach acids. Coffee after eating can also prevent post-meal drowsiness. This timing may improve how you absorb some nutrients. Plus, it offers a relaxing moment after your meal ends.

# Impact On Metabolism And Digestion

Coffee affects metabolism by increasing your energy use temporarily. It can speed up digestion, helping food move faster through your gut. Some studies show coffee helps break down fats more quickly. Too much coffee, though, may upset digestion and cause discomfort. Balance and timing are key to avoid negative effects.

1oqxlj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oqxlj3/nine_months_today/,Nine months today!,"I almost forgot. Wow. Here is what I've noted so far: 

PROS
- drinking FOMO has subsided 
- emotional processing and recovery is like... the best it's ever been. I can shrug my shoulders and keep on trucking when stuff gets under my skin instead of wallowing in it
- anxiety and depression are low hums sometimes rather than crippling factors that make me stay in bed
- I look 10 years younger than I am 
- I am in probably the best shape of my life and work out five days a week. I still cant believe I can do some of the physical things I can do
- I get a natural high from exercise that feels floaty and satisfied and clean 
- I am so contented with my routine. I commit to my workouts. I have a class I go to every week that I really enjoy for the activity and camaraderie. I have my favorite coffee shop and a genre of books I like. I have a pub in town I sometimes go to for some conversation and an NA or two. My husband and I relax with some Netflix, almonds and chocolate at night instead of two bottles of wine. 
- My sleep is fairly consistent. 
- My GI system used to be all fucked up from anxiety and now it is not painful or uncomfortable or unpredictable. 

CONS
- sometimes very high emotions like extreme joy and euphoria are a little more difficult for me to access. However, I am learning what makes me tick and gives me that pumped up feeling naturally. Things like connection, music, creativity. 

- I am low key nervous about the holidays coming up because in my life and the environment I am in, they've been exceptionally boozy. I sometimes struggle with stress and perfectionist expectations during the holidays so I am learning that its OK if I dont feel on top of the world like people in Christmas movies.

1oqxkdl,https://i.redd.it/fg19h0gptuzf1.jpeg,3 Days to Test,"Well I completed DestCert at 90 percent a few weeks ago, replayed the Mindmaps a few times and got the QE CAT version. 🐈  QE 1st and 2nd attempt showed me the quiz mentality and those questions got my brain 🧠 flowing. I focused on the weak domains and yesterday was my 3 attempt at CAT 🐈.  I have taken 4 10-minute exams in between but my focus has been thinking about the question structure and the tricks. I was so happy that I got a 792 yesterday with 3 attempts and got my confidence back as QE is highly praised. I will finish off strong these next 3 days with the rest of QE and have a couple questions. BTW, I am not going to take any ""think like a manager"" training as I have been a Director for over 10 years (maybe this is helping) and focus more on that mentality rather than the technical side.

1) Are we allowed to use scratch paper during exam? I am thinking of very quickly regurgitating Mnemonics of the process orders on paper 📃.  ""All people seem to need data processing""

2) Are drinks allowed during exam? I need my coffee 

3) People recommend relaxing the brain 24 hours before exam but taking the day off prior to exam is scary for me and I feel information will be lost.

4) IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU THINK WILL HELP ME PREPARE THESE FINAL 3 DAY?

I can't be bothered (nor do I have the credentials) to lecture on the land fish ""debate"" - see Hank Green for the explanation. [https://www.instagram.com/reels/DMqTDFDxuSH/](https://www.instagram.com/reels/DMqTDFDxuSH/)

  
Of course, it's a ridiculous claim. You're not a fish, you don't look like a fish, behave like a fish, have the genes of a fish, you don't have the organs of a fish. You aren't phenotypically, karyotypically, chromosomally, morphologically, anatomically, sexually, behaviorally, or socially a fish. However, taxonomically speaking, we are all descended from a organisms which would fit the current definition of ""fish"". If your all of your ancestors on every level of your family tree are fish, what makes you special???

  
This is an intentionally transphobic sounding argument. Of course I identify as a fish, don't you? (Satirical) In reality its the exact opposite.

In fact, the issue isn't with the biology, it's with linguistics - we haven't defined a fish properly. Or we've attempted to change the definition we had previously assumed to be correct into one that fits our current biological understanding of what a fish is - and that makes it icky.

In a similar vain, we haven't defined ""man"" and ""woman"" properly. Hell, even ""man"" used to mean ""person"", so, historically speaking, we are all ""men"", even the women (and children and those outside the binary). But there again, Trump re-defined everyone to be a ""woman"" (sex conceived at birth\*), so now, every woman is a man, every man is a woman, every child is an adult - and then we get ultra-right-wing pedophiles trying to morally justify reducing the age of consent since they consider it more morally apt than being able to access gender affirming care, despite an increasingly great quantity and complexity of hurdles to access such. ""Wer"" and ""Wif"" are actually more analogous with the modern ""man"" and ""woman"", despite only a handful of modern linguistical artefacts still existing - ""wer(e)wolf"" (man - wolf); ""midwife"" (with woman).

So, where does this leave us?

Firstly, define. Oh, you can't? Well then sit down! Language changes, and definitions are descriptive not prescriptive - if we find that a chair has 5 legs, not 4, we change the definition, we don't prescribe to exclude it from the definition. Also, if we take a 4 legged chair, cut it up and re-assemble it as a coffee table, we don't still call it a chair, and we certainly wouldn't show it to a guest expecting them to not put a drink on it but to sit on it. We also would be happy to take a chair and use it as a coffee table if it was no longer suitable to sit on, despite it still looking like a chair, and most people wouldn't be too phased to be told not to sit on it, since, despite still being identified as a chair by appearance, it is no longer to be used as a chair. This metaphor is difficult to continue, since chairs aren't sentient and don't have an internal sense of self. Similarly, trans people aren't furniture or objects (unless they are informed, consenting adults).

Hypothetically, lets abolish the terms if you're definitively prescriptive over them. Instead, we can use ""dim"" and ""dum"". They shall have no definitions, only being the signs on toilet doors. Which toilet are you going to use (if neither have urinals)? Personally, I would use the one which those who I identify with are also using - I would do the same if it was ""archery"" or ""skating"". I'm more of a skater, so guess which toilet I'm going to use. I'd only pose a risk to the archers because I'd be a novice but I'm guessing you don't point the sharp pointy thing at other archers. This isn't meant to have any analogy other than pointing out how arbitrary the classifications can be despite having its uses: I shouldn't skate with a bow and arrow, nor should I expect to lose my job because I skate, unless, of course, my job relies on my archery ability.

Secondly, educate yourself. Humans aren't binary - we follow a bimodal distribution, i.e. the graphical representation of trends correlates to a double bell curve. Most humans are typically male and identify as men, or are typically female and identify as women. There is not a single presentation of 100% male or 100% female. Even the most manliest of men will have some characteristic that is typically female and vice versa - and this will change depending upon age. We may accelerate change in either direction with gender affirming treatments, from shaving or wearing make-up to surgeries and HRT. And I'm completely glossing over the fact that gender presentation, gender expression, gender identity, acquired sex, legal sex and assigned/assumed sex are not the same things nor are necessarily correlated.

Thirdly, biology DOESN'T care about your feelings Karen! Even if you wanted to ignore all the science on trans people and just consider the biology of intersex conditions, you'd still be massively misinformed. Basic biology just won't cut it, I'm afraid. Would you like a donut to sit on, since you're so butt-hurt...

N.B. This is not intended to be a biological essentialism retort, it is meant to rebut anti-trans biological essentialism. Your biology doesn't define you.

  
P.S. If any of this reads in any way transphobic, please feel free to pick me up on it. We all have subconscious biases, but I'm happy for mine to become illuminated so I can do better in the future.

\*that's not actually strictly true, embryos do not have any sex upon conception, it is typically the activation of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome that induces the foetus to develop male characteristics, and the lack of activation (or sensitivity to activation) that induces female characteristics to develop. A typical male doesn't develop as female and then morph into a male, they develop non-sexually (avoiding the use of the term ""asexual"" for clarity) and develop male sexual characteristics, as does a typical female developing female sexual characteristics. In fact, Trump may have declared that everybody was agender!",5,1762529680.0,transgenderUK,1,0.86,False

Bali — the very name evokes images of sun-kissed beaches, intricate Hindu temples, lush rice terraces, and a culture as vibrant as its landscapes. Often referred to as the “Island of the Gods,” Bali has long been a magnet for travelers seeking a perfect blend of relaxation, adventure, and spirituality. Yet, contrary to popular belief, this enchanting destination isn’t reserved only for honeymooners or couples. From solo adventurers and families to wellness seekers and party enthusiasts, Bali has a unique rhythm that resonates with every kind of traveler.

# The Allure of Bali: More Than Just a Beach Destination

https://preview.redd.it/jf4kh9nmsuzf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f50e5e3bb89ea705661bcf9723d7a8da14bd814

Bali’s charm lies in its diversity. It’s a destination where the turquoise waters of Seminyak meet the emerald rice terraces of Ubud; where spiritual ceremonies echo across ancient temples while beach clubs pulse to the beat of modern music. Whether you come for adventure or tranquility, you’ll find an island that constantly reveals new sides of itself.

For beach lovers, Bali’s coastline is pure paradise. Iconic beaches such as Kuta, Seminyak, and Nusa Dua are lined with powdery white sands, inviting waves, and sunsets that paint the horizon in fiery hues. Kuta is the bustling heart of Bali’s surf scene, while Seminyak offers sophistication through upscale resorts, beach bars, and fine dining. Meanwhile, Nusa Dua provides a more serene, family-friendly retreat with calm waters and luxury hotels perfect for unwinding.

For those drawn to culture, Ubud is the spiritual and artistic soul of Bali. Here, you can witness traditional Balinese dance performances, explore centuries-old temples, or wander through local art markets filled with handmade crafts. The Ubud Monkey Forest, the Tegallalang Rice Terraces, and the Pura Taman Saraswati Temple are just a few of the must-visit spots that immerse visitors in Bali’s deep-rooted traditions.

# Wellness, Adventure, and the Spirit of Exploration

https://preview.redd.it/us01j6wosuzf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a519c32fc6d380d635eceeec04fd7d44685fa34

Over the past decade, Bali has emerged as one of the world’s top wellness destinations. Ubud, in particular, has become a sanctuary for yoga practitioners and spiritual seekers, home to countless yoga studios, holistic retreats, and organic eateries. From sunrise meditations overlooking the jungle canopy to spa therapies using traditional Balinese oils, every experience here rejuvenates body, mind, and soul.

For thrill-seekers, adventure awaits around every corner. Trekking to the top of **Mount Batur** before dawn to watch the sunrise over the caldera is a rite of passage for many travelers. On the water, surfing, diving, and snorkeling thrive year-round. The **Nusa Islands**, just a short boat ride from the mainland, are havens for crystal-clear waters, coral gardens, and dramatic cliffside views. Meanwhile, the tranquil village of **Amed** on Bali’s east coast offers black-sand beaches and spectacular diving without the crowds. For those craving cool mountain air and waterfalls, **Munduk** is a hidden gem nestled among coffee plantations and mist-shrouded hills.

# When to Visit: Finding the Perfect Season

https://preview.redd.it/9uryk7uqsuzf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=00eb16441c2e7e255ee4c0a2925d0542783dffe0

Bali enjoys a tropical climate, which means warm weather all year. The **dry season (April–September)** is the best time for beach days, diving, and hiking, with sunny skies and minimal rainfall. However, this period is also the island’s peak tourist season — expect higher prices and more crowded attractions. The **wet season (October–March)** brings occasional heavy showers but also lush greenery, fewer crowds, and discounted accommodations. These tropical downpours are usually short-lived, and the island quickly returns to sunshine. For the best of both worlds, consider visiting during the **shoulder months of April-May or September-October**, when the weather is pleasant and the island feels more relaxed.

# Travel Essentials: Visa, Regulations, and Transport

As of **2025**, visitors from most countries can still obtain a **Visa on Arrival (VOA)** for around USD 35, valid for 30 days and extendable for another 30. Indonesia recently introduced the **All Indonesia App**, a digital arrival system that combines immigration, customs, and health declarations — making entry faster and more efficient. Additionally, foreign visitors are now required to pay a **tourist levy of IDR 150,000 (approx. USD 10)**, aimed at supporting conservation and sustainable tourism efforts.

When it comes to exploring Bali, travelers often rely on scooters, taxis, or private drivers. However, it’s crucial to remember that **an** [**International Driving Permit**](https://www.e-itca.org/) **(IDP)** is mandatory for anyone operating a vehicle. Local police are strict about enforcing this rule, and heavy fines await those without proper documentation. Visitors should also carry their home-country driving license and ensure their travel insurance covers driving-related incidents. Apps like **Grab** and **Gojek** are reliable for safe and affordable rides around the island.

# Current Travel Trends: Sustainable and Smarter Tourism

https://preview.redd.it/4tkleittsuzf1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=b770ff3ba537ba8bd842ce74f77f7d003ab24cf2

In 2025, Bali is taking significant steps toward managing over-tourism and promoting sustainability. Following deadly floods and environmental strain, local authorities have **banned new hotel and restaurant developments** in certain regions to preserve the island’s natural balance. At the same time, **Ngurah Rai International Airport** has implemented smarter baggage screening systems to cut down on long queues, improving the arrival experience for international travelers.

Tourists are also encouraged to respect the new **“Bali Life Guidelines,”** which outline acceptable behavior, dress codes in temples, and environmental responsibilities. Single-use plastics have been largely phased out, and eco-conscious travel — from reusable bottles to ethical animal tourism — is becoming the new norm.

# Essential Cultural and Practical Tips

Respect for local customs is at the heart of the Balinese experience. When visiting temples, wear modest clothing that covers your shoulders and knees. Avoid stepping on offerings (*canang sari*) placed on the ground, as they are daily tributes to the gods. Bargaining is a common practice in markets — do so politely and with a smile. The local currency is **Indonesian Rupiah (IDR)**; cash is still preferred for small purchases, though cards are accepted in most hotels and restaurants.

Learning a few simple phrases in **Bahasa Indonesia** such as *“Terima kasih”* (thank you) or *“Selamat pagi”* (good morning) goes a long way in earning smiles and goodwill. Above all, patience and kindness go far in Bali, where the locals’ warmth and hospitality are as much a part of the experience as the island’s scenic beauty.

# Discover the True Spirit of Bali

Bali is more than just a destination — it’s a state of mind. It invites you to slow down, breathe deeply, and immerse yourself in moments of beauty and meaning. Whether you’re catching the sunrise atop Mount Batur, sipping coconut water on Seminyak Beach, meditating by the Ayung River, or simply watching daily life unfold in a traditional village, Bali has a way of touching the soul.

In 2025, as the island embraces sustainable travel and cultural preservation, it remains one of the world’s most rewarding destinations — a place where every traveler, whether solo, in love, or with family, can find their own version of paradise.

1oqxcth,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oqxcth/hr_the_tale_of_crazy_jim/,[HR] The Tale Of Crazy Jim,"The year was 1987 and four men sat in a smoking room in a large mansion in Riverdale, Missouri. The old man in the suit lit his pipe. The briar got warm and he blew out some smoke into the air.

“You know, I once saw a man get murdered right there in that room,” he said.

“What, the dining room?” the man in the chair across from him asked.

“Oh, yes. In the dining room. That was some years ago now,” the old man said. His name was Mark Lanston and he was the man who owned the Riverdale Newspaper. He was a wealthy man. He had seen his share of good and bad things in life and the frightening things.

“I don't believe it, but I will listen to the story. I will give it a try,” the man across from him said. His name was James Yorkshire. He was a British man and he was a fine art dealer. He liked art and the experiences of life but he didn't believe in the supernatural at all.

“Well...,” the old man began to say and he lit up the briar and then expelled some more smoke. “It was ten years ago now. I had just overseen a great story abut the recent success of the mill. How they had acceded their quota and production was good. It was just after some bad storm that had caused quite a bit of property damage. I read the newspaper and joyously I said out loud to everybody, “This town is going to keep kickin!” He laughed a little and then went on. “And I heard that somebody by the name of Jim Moody had won the recent fishing competition.”

“That's right. I remember that. We did good work at the mill that year,” Ted Nodington said. He was the owner of the Riverdale Sawmill. Riverdale was a town built on the lumber business and it had brought a lot of people economic opportunities and prosperity.

“Yes, and Jim Moody caught the largest bass that anyone had ever seen. It was quite a sight,” Mark said. “It also made the paper,” he added.

“Yeah, a nice big fish,” the British man said.

Mark lit his pipe and expelled some more smoke, then went on. “Anyway, there was a story – more of an urban legend – that was told and spread around these parts. The whole town knows it. It is the tale of Crazy Jim. He was in the lumber business. He was a logger and it was in 1874. He would help cut down the oak trees. They were oak, red oak, and black walnut trees. Anyway, after he had worked there for some years, he had developed bad relations with a fellow worker. There was one time that he had been working on the job on a hot day and he had just gotten a reduction in his pay and the man that he didn't like had just gotten a promotion. The story goes that Jim had worked there for more years than the other man, and that he worker harder, too. Upon hearing that the man had gotten the promotion, Jim had gone nuts and he killed the man, and three other men with small hand axes, one in each hand. Somebody shot him, though we don't know who, and killed him on the spot. It must have been with a deer rifle, I suspect. Anyway, the story goes that sometime after that Crazy Jim started appearing to people and some would die. If someone would say his name at night next to candle light after the clock would strike twelve at night, he would appear and kill that person. It would also happen to people who had recently gotten financial success who had said his name at night, and there were warnings that young teenage lovers should not go to the spot next to the edge of Table Rock Lake at night or Crazy Jim would get them. I am sure that the story had morphed over time,” Mark said.

“Bollocks,” James said and laughed a little.

“No. I swear its true,” Mark said.

“I have heard this one before. There are some stories in this town that have stuck around,” Scott Bentwater said. He was from Louisiana and he had an accent. He worked at a local library in town.

“Ah, my librarian friend. It is about time that you chimed in,” James said.

“I think that I will continue now,” Mark said. The men sat and waited. The fireplace was lit and the atmosphere was right for the story.

“Right, go ahead,” James said and leaned back in his chair.

“Hu, yeah. There were old newspaper stories about him. In 1903, there was a wealthy businessman who was killed by Crazy Jim. Came for him right dawn the hallway in his house. There was some younger man who was running errands for him and when he walked inside, he saw the whole thing. That is what he told them for the paper, anyway,” Mark said and then he looked down and he looked like he started to drift off.

Ted leaned in and looked at him. “And then what happened?” he asked curiously.

“They printed the paper. The local people believed him for a while, then everyone seemed to just forget the whole thing.”

“Humm. Interesting. We have the story of Springheel Jack. He is just a legend though,” James said.

“Yes. Well, this story is a bit more than legend,” Mark said and he looked around at his friends. “In 1930, there was another story about Crazy Jim in much more detail. There was a postal worker who had come home one day and he said that in the middle of the night that he saw the ghost of a man walking thorough his house. He said that the ghost looked like a man form the 1800s and he emitted a faint glowing blue light, and that he had small axes in his hands. He was also dripping with blood, too. The next day, he found out that the person living in the house next to him had died,” Mark said and then he looked around at them.

“Well...that would give me the creeps,” Ted said.

“You know, there could be strange things going on in this town,” Scott said after a long pause.

“Oh yea?” Ted said. He was an Agnostic about the supernatural history of the town. To him, he needed the proof. He just needed that little nudge.

“Yeah. I am not really saying what I believe, but I do go to church and I do like to read books,” Scott said.

“Well...,” James said then he lit his pipe and blew out a puff of smoke. “Do go on.”

“Right. Supposedly, if people recently achieve some great financial success and they said the phrase, “Crazy Jim can't get me now” at night, when the clock strikes twelve, then Crazy Jim would come for that person, bearing his axes in his hands,” Mark said. His voice had gotten serious toward the last part of saying it.

There was a silence that filled the room and there was the sounds of the crackling of the fireplace.

“I must say, that is a good story. But what about the thing that you said that you saw?” the British man asked.

“That is what I was going to get to next,” Mark said and looked up. “I saw Crazy Jim. It was ten years ago. It happened here just over there in that room.” He looked over and pointed at the room next to them which was joined by a long hallway. It was the dining room, which had never really been used much. *Why there?* He thought.

“What did you see?” Ted asked.

“Is this about the man who fell down the stairs?” James asked before Mark could answer, though he wasn't really asking. Skeptics always had a sort of rudeness about them.

“That was just what we had to print,” Mark said. “I saw what really happened, but we didn't put it in the paper for obvious reasons,” he said thoughtfully.

“Yeah. So what did you see that night?” Ted asked. He wanted to get his answer.

“It was around midnight and one young man had just gotten some work done for us. He had gotten done with some roofing repairs for us. He was some guy from Aspen Contractors, a real nice kid. He had come by to drop off some papers. He was walking down the stairs and he fell down to the bottom, then he looked up and he must of saw him. He screamed and then Crazy Jim came after him. I saw him. I was sitting right here in this chair and I saw it happen. Crazy Jim looked just like the other people had described. He was partially transparent and there was a glowing blue faint light around him, and he was dripping with blood. He sliced him with his axes and the young man died on the spot and then the figure disappeared. We had to just tell people that somebody broke in and did it. That is what we had to say,” Mark said and then he looked down again.

There was another silence that filled the room, broken only by the crackling of the fireplace.

“Is there any possibility that you had just imaged it? I am not saying that I don't believe you, I do. I am just wondering if somebody actually did break in that night,” Ted said, being careful with his words.

“Well, I …suppose that it is possible. I don't know,” the old man said. He was still looking down at the floor. “It is just the strangest thing.”

“And this guy who might of snuck in. Was there any evidence that he as there?” James asked.

“Well, now that you mentioned it, there might of been, There was a back window that was partially open,” Mark said. Remembering that little detail had given him hope that Crazy Jim wasn't actually real.

“And there it is,” James said.

“I would hope that nothing supernatural was going on,” Ted said. He shivered a little.

“What about the intruder?” James asked.

“Well, if he existed, he got away.”

“You see, there was nothing supernatural going on. It was just a crazed man,” James said, trying to reassure the old man.

“I don't know. I still believe that I saw a ghost that night,” the old man said slowly.

They all knew that they wouldn't convince him that he had not seen a ghost, and they were not quite sure what to believe themselves. They let the conversation naturally go where it did.

“You know, I am a superstitious man,” the librarian said. “I leaned some over the years and I have kept my mouth shut. My uncle worked at a sawmill. There was an accident. He cut two of his fingers off. They reattached them and he went on with life. I never challenged old stories, urban legends, and ghost stories myself. I go about my life and I stay out of trouble,” he said with certainty. His statements were matter of fact.

“Stray out of trouble. That is what we are trying to do here. Well, accept maybe James here,” Mark said and chuckled a little.

James laughed a little bit. “Yeah. Well, this one guy lowballed me on a painting that I was trying to sell. I got so mad that I punched him.”

Ted laughed at that.

“Yeah. I sure did. I didn't even think about it. I just did it,” James said.

“And then what happened after that?” Mark asked.

“I got another painting for several thousand dollars more. Crazy Jim can't get me now,” James said with a happy expression and smoked his pipe.

*He said it,* Mark thought.

His face took on a more serious expression. He didn't want his friends to see that so he laughed a little. *He is still alive so far.*

“We had just acceded our quota. Crazy Jim can't get me either,” Ted said and he joined the general good spirit of the room.

Scot didn't say anything. He simply sat there and observed.

“Well, it is supposed to start snowing soon. You guys going to come up for the winter?” Mark said.

“Yeah. I will be here,” James said. The other men agreed.

“Good. Good. My old bones can't handle the cold. It gets worse every year. But the newspaper and the mountain views up North, that makes me feel like I will live forever.”

“Here, here,” Ted said. The other men agreed.

“Hey, I am planning on a trip up North to go see the mountain views sometime. Are you guys going to come with me?” Mark asked.

The men said that they would and they all continued talking for a while as the night went on. They said their goodbyes and then headed back to their homes and James went back to his hotel room.



James sat on his bed in his room at the Riverdale Hotel. There were echos of past events in his mind. He had been thinking about the man who had lowballed him on the old painting and how he had punched him. *I got him pretty good,* he thought.

The painting itself was just a nature painting of some woods with the sun shining through them. It was about the insult of it all. James did get a nice deal on another piece after that and then he had his tea with two sugar cubes. Lately, though, he had been drinking the local coffee, “It is like heaven on Earth,” Mark had told him one time years ago before he had arrived for a visit and Mark had been right. James thought that the coffee here was amazing.

He stood up and paced around the room for a moment, thinking about his next business adventure. Tomorrow, he had to fly out with United Airlines to Ireland to go look at an art auction. He thought of the score in his mind, of the deal that he would make. It would be a killing.

He wanted to get a cup of coffee for the night. They would still allow him to make himself one downstairs and that is where he headed. He opened the door and then walked out. There was a long hallway with wooden walls and a decorated green carpet that ran along the floor. There was an old grandfather clock that stood next to one wall. It looked pleasing to the eye with its dark wood and the pendulum swung. James walked down the hall and when he passed by it, he heard it tick as the seconds went by. He had not noticed it when he had arrived and walked by it earlier that morning, but he noticed it now. He thought that that was strange. He walked down the stairs and he made some coffee and then headed back upstairs to his room.

When he stood there in his room, he took a sip of coffee. “Like the mist of the top of a blue mountain,” he said. He thought about the auction. He thought about when he was going to be there, who he was going to talk to, how he was going to deliver the pitch and just how he might go about getting a nice painting that he could add to his collection. He supposed that he would visit some places that he had not been to in Europe after that.

He took a couple sips of his coffee and then set it down on the night stand. He stood there and thought with all the confidence in the world how an English gentleman like himself would go about his business and then he heard something, It was the chimes of the grandfather clock and then it struck the hour for twelve at midnight. *My God, its midnight already,* he thought. *Who would of known.* He took a couple steps forward and then he heard something else. There were creaking sounds. They were the wooden walls in his room. They stopped then, and James thought, *The creaking of the wood in these walls almost gave me a scare.* He exhaled in relief and then he sat down.

There was the sound of something coming from the wall infront of him. It was a low sound that groaned and the wood creaked with it. It was a strange sound. James had never heard that sound before. It also sounded like there were voices, too. He heard something else just then. It sounded as if the wall was being pulled inward. It almost looked like it, too. Whatever was doing that to the wall seemed to have great strength. The area around the wall seemed to get darker. There was something else just then. He saw that a shape was slowly appearing on the wall. It was the shape of a face. It was colored blue and it came out of the wall slowly and it moved into the room. Seeing that scared the shit out of James. The face was the face of a man and he walked through the wall and into the room. James saw the figure of the body come into view.

The figure of the man came through the wall and James saw him. The man wore old clothes, possibly from the 1800s, and his body was transparent and it glew a light blue color. It also dripped with blood. James knew who it was, or rather who it was supposed to be.

*Crazy Jim. He is coming for me.*

The sight of the blood dripping on the floor and making that splat sound unerved him. It made him feel strange and almost sick. The sight of the ghostly figure and the horror of it all overpowered those sensations, though. He then saw something else. In the man's hands, he held small axes that were stained with blood.

James was terrified. *No,* he thought. *NO!* *He can't come for me.* He got up and walked to the side of the bed. He kept his eyes on the figure. It came after him and in that moment, he realized that he could of ran for the door and he could of escaped. It was too late now. The figure came at him with an axe raised and James screamed. Crazy Jim sliced him with his axes and blood splattered the wall and the bed. A moment later, a man from the hotel staff entered the room and he saw the sight.



Mark sat at home in his chair in the living room. The room was mostly dark except for the lamp that was next to him. He had been reading for the night like he did sometimes. He was reading a book by Jules Verne. In Mark's mind, Jules Verne had taken him on some adventures. He read some and then he thought that it was time for him to go to bed. He closed his book and set it on the coffee table, then he turned the lamp light off. There were a few other dim lights on in the house for him to see by. He walked out of the living room and to his room. He walked through a hallway and just then, the grandfather clock in the living room stuck twelve. It played its chimes and then it struck the hour. It scared him when it went off. After being startled from the sound, he exhaled and calmed down some. “Gave me the creeps,” he said out loud. He then proceeded to walk down the hall.

He heard a groaning sound and then he saw something. It looked like a faint blue glow in the darkness. *Are my eyes playing tricks on me?* He thought. There was the sounds of wood creaking and it was followed by groaning sounds, then there was something else. It was a strange sound. It sounded low and distant, and then it got louder. It sounded almost like the wood in the walls was groaning under the immense pressing and at the same time it sounded as if it had come from the voices of many people, or creatures of some unspeakable kind. That frightened him. What unholy horror was about to come upon him? He saw that the faint glow had come more into view and more of its features were reviled now. He saw that it was a face, and then the body came through the wall.

*Crazy Jim. He has come for me.*

The ghost of Crazy Jim ran down the hall at him and he swung his axes at him. One axe blade cut him on the lower stomach and the other cut his leg. It happened so fast. Mark turned and fell down. In that moment, Jim cut him across the back and the back of one of his legs. After Mark had fallen, he turned around the looked at the figure. The ghost then sliced his throat and blood splattered the walls. The old man died and then Jim faded away and he merged with the walls.

Ted had died that night as well. The police had discovered him the next morning on the floor of his kitchen in one corner of the room. His body leaned against the blood soaked wall and he was looking up with his eye open. It seemed as if he had been looking at something, and the expression on his face gave the policemen quite a fright.

Scott had woken up to some nice sunshine and the sound of a rooster doing his morning call off in the distance. He had made himself some coffee and drank it while he looked out of a window. He thought that it was going to be a good day that day. It was sometime later that he learned what had happened some hours before then. After learning the truth about the loss of his friends, the world felt strange to him for a while. He did manage the loss, however. He kept his job at the library, and he respected the old stories and superstitions of other people. *The world is a strange place sometimes,* he would think sometimes.",1,1762529221.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1oqxbpt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqxbpt,Ra đi và trở về: Những dấu ấn đa dạng của 'thuyền nhân'.,"

Hôm nọ, nhân đọc báo mới biết một thông tin hay: người sáng lập chuỗi quán cà phê HighLands là một Việt kiều Mĩ tên David Thái! 

Tôi thích cà phê Highlands. Đi đâu ở Việt Nam, tôi cũng tìm tới tiệm cà phê Highlands, vì cách pha chế cà phê hợp với khẩu vị của tôi. Ngoài ra, cái không gian sạch sẽ, đơn giản mà ấm cúng của Highlands cũng rất hợp với tôi. 

Hồi nào đến giờ, tôi cứ giả định rằng chuỗi tiệm cà phê Highlands là của một đại gia nào đó ở vùng Cao Nguyên (như Đặng Lê Nguyên Vũ). Ai ngờ đâu ông chủ của Highlands Coffee là một 'Việt kiều': David Thái. 

■ Bắt đầu từ học tiếng Việt 

Đó là một người kín tiếng, nên ít ai biết đến anh ấy. Tên tiếng Việt là Thái Phi Điệp, sanh năm 1972 tại Việt Nam. Năm 1979, mới 7 tuổi, David theo gia đình sang Mĩ định cư thời ""Thuyền Nhân"". 

David Thái cho biết gia đình anh nghèo, còn anh thì từng làm biếng học hành. Vì vậy ước mơ của anh cũng khiêm tốn: “Tôi chỉ mơ có đủ tiền, có một công việc tốt, phụng dưỡng cha mẹ, đỡ đần anh chị em, chăm lo cho gia đình, đóng học cho con”.

Câu chuyện anh ấy về Việt Nam cũng thú vị. Năm 1996, về Việt Nam để học tiếng Việt, và chỉ man theo gần 1000 USD trong túi. Anh xin được một công việc phiên dịch và được sự tin tưởng của một nhà đầu tư, David quyết định bắt đầu sự nghiệp kinh doanh. 

Anh mở quán cà phê Âu Lạc gần hồ Hoàn Kiếm, nhanh chóng gây tiếng vang. Nhưng chỉ sau thời gian ngắn, nhà đầu tư rút vốn và bị “hất cẳng”, dù anh đã thuyết phục làm lại từ đầu. Với số tiền tiết kiệm ít ỏi, anh nhận ra cơ hội lớn: thị trường cà phê nội địa còn bỏ ngỏ khi các doanh nghiệp Việt chủ yếu tập trung xuất khẩu. 

Năm 1997, qua tìm hiểu luật đầu tư nước ngoài, anh trở thành Việt kiều đầu tiên được cấp phép thành lập công ti  tư nhân tại Hà Nội. Năm 2000, anh là doanh nhân đầu tiên đăng kí công ty cổ phần. Và vào 2002, tập đoàn Việt Thái ra đời với hai tiệm Highlands Coffee đầu tiên tại Hà Nội và Sài Gòn. 

Chỉ sau 7 năm, Highlands Coffee đã có hơn 80 cửa hàng tại 6 tỉnh thành lớn: Hà Nội, Sài Gòn, Hải Phòng, Đà Nẵng, Vũng Tàu và Đồng Nai. Ngày nay, Highlands Coffee là thương hiệu hàng đầu về cà phê tại Việt Nam, có mặt khắp các tỉnh thành. 

■ Đi và về 

Trước đó, tôi biết rằng đạo diễn phim ""Tử Chiến Trên Không"" là một Việt kiều: Hàm Trần. Anh này từng làm phim tị nạn ""Vượt Sóng"" ở bên Mĩ. Không ngờ anh này làm phim mới hơi khác với Vượt Sóng. Nhưng dù sao thì anh ấy cũng có đóng góp cho nền điện ảnh Việt Nam đang rất cần nhân tố mới. 

Còn ở Úc tôi, có anh chàng Luke Nguyễn là con của một gia đình boat people', một chef nổi tiếng, cũng trở về Việt Nam. Anh nói rằng ""Tôi trở về Việt Nam bởi vì tôi muốn hiểu rõ ba mẹ tôi nhiều hơn, tôi hiểu rõ hơn về bản thân mình, về di sản của mình, để có thể tha thứ một chút, để chữa lành vết thương."" 

Hành trình của những người Việt ra đi và trở về (như David Thái, Hàm Trần, Luke Nguyễn) là những câu chuyện đầy cảm hứng. Sự ra đi ấy, thường gắn liền với nghèo khó, bất định và khát khao tự do, đã mở ra những chân trời mới ở xứ người. Nhưng khi trở về, mỗi người lại mang theo những lựa chọn khác nhau, tạo nên bức tranh đa dạng về đóng góp và cuộc sống.

Không phải ai cũng chọn trở về. Nhiều người bạn tôi, sau khi định cư ổn định ở Mĩ, Úc, Gia Nã Đại hay châu Âu, quyết định ở lại để xây dựng sự nghiệp và gia đình tại quê hương thứ hai. Họ gởi kiều hối về giúp đỡ người thân, đóng góp từ xa qua các tổ chức từ thiện, nhưng không về quê. Sự lựa chọn này thường xuất phát từ nỗi ám ảnh về những biến cố cũ, hoặc vì đã bén rễ sâu ở xứ sở mới, nơi cơ hội giáo dục và kinh doanh rộng mở hơn. 

David Thái từng chia sẻ giấc mơ khiêm tốn của mình ở Mĩ: chỉ cần công việc tốt để phụng dưỡng cha mẹ và lo cho con cái. Với nhiều thuyền nhân khác, giấc mơ ấy đã thành hiện thực mà không cần quay về.

Ngược lại, một số thuyền nhân chọn trở về và mang theo vốn liếng, kinh nghiệm để đóng góp quan trọng cho quê hương. David Thái là minh chứng điển hình. Hành trình của anh ấy không chỉ tạo việc làm cho hàng ngàn người, mà còn nâng tầm ngành cà phê nội địa, từ xuất khẩu thô sang chuỗi bán lẻ hiện đại. Nhiều thuyền nhân khác cũng vậy: họ về đóng góp vào động sản, công nghệ, thể thao, điện ảnh, giáo dục, y tế, v.v. Những đóng góp này thường xuất phát từ tình yêu mảnh đất đã sanh ra mình, biến kinh nghiệm hải ngoại thành động lực đổi mới.

Dĩ nhiên, cũng có những người trở về chỉ để hưởng thụ. Sau bao năm lao động cực nhọc ở nước ngoài, họ mang theo tài sản tích lũy để nghỉ ngơi, xây nhà cửa, du lịch hoặc sống cuộc đời nhàn hạ bên gia đình. Lựa chọn này không phải lúc nào cũng bị chỉ trích; nó phản ảnh quyền tự do cá nhân sau những hi sinh lớn lao. Dù vậy, nó cũng nhắc nhở rằng hành trình trở về không phải lúc nào cũng đồng nghĩa với đóng góp xã hội.

Tóm lại, từ sự ra đi đầy gian nan của thuyền nhân đến những lựa chọn trở về đa dạng, câu chuyện của những người như David Thái và bao người khác nói lên ý chí và cơ hội. Dù ở lại hay quay về, dù đóng góp hay hưởng thụ, họ đều là những mảnh ghép quan trọng trong bức tranh Việt Nam hiện đại. Nói ra thì có vẻ to tát nhưng tôi thấy Highlands Coffee không chỉ là tách cà phê ngon, mà còn là biểu tượng của hành trình đó: ra đi và trở về.

1oqxbdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SECWatch/comments/1oqxbdb/what_smart_money_did_thursday/,What Smart Money Did Thursday,"**The Big Picture**

When a founding family unloads a billion dollars’ worth of stock, the market holds its breath. That’s one story commanding attention today, as trusts affiliated with the Lauder family executed a massive internal restructuring.

But an even bigger theme emerged from Thursday's filings: a stark divergence in corporate strategy and fortune, punctuated by a frenzy of M&A deals, massive capital returns, and a tidal wave of impairments.

The most transformative M&A news came from EchoStar (SATS), which announced a landmark $19.6 billion sale of its spectrum portfolio to SpaceX. It was joined by a blockbuster $612 million all-cash acquisition of private market platform Forge Global (FRGE) by Charles Schwab.

While some companies are raising cash at any cost — including a $1.4 billion debt offering from crypto miner Cipher Mining (CIFR) and a drone company filing for financing that could dilute shareholders by over 200% — others are returning it with stunning aggression.

Foodservice giant US Foods (USFD) disclosed it had bought back $335 million of its stock, while NRG Energy (NRG) unveiled a colossal new $3 billion share repurchase program. Payments firm Shift4 (FOUR) announced a $1 billion buyback, equal to nearly 22% of its market cap.

They were joined by Tapestry (TPR), Vistra (VST), and GEO Group (GEO), all announcing billion-dollar or near-billion-dollar buybacks.

It was also a banner day for blowout, record-setting earnings from Datadog (DDOG), US Foods (USFD), AAON (AAON), Insulet (PODD), Celsius (CELH), Monster (MNST), Ralph Lauren (RL), Planet Fitness (PLNT), and more.

At the same time, others flashed warning signs. Teleflex (TFX) reported a $512 million impairment charge. CarMax (KMX) terminated its CEO alongside an 8–12% drop in sales. ONITY Group (ONIT) lost a major client worth $33 billion in loans. Cogent (CCOI) and Bloomin’ Brands (BLMN) suspended dividends. Aspen Aerogels (ASPN) and Papa John’s (PZZA) cut guidance.

From Mario Gabelli’s $18.3 million insider buy to CrowdStrike (CRWD) trusts filing to sell over $1 billion in stock — Thursday’s filings paint a vivid picture of a market at a crossroads.

**What This Means for Your Portfolio**

Thursday’s filings reveal two types of companies:

Cash Raisers diluting to survive (e.g., OSCR, SEAT).

Cash Returners aggressively buying back shares (NRG, FOUR, USFD).

The big insider buys (Gabelli) and massive M&A (Schwab–Forge, SpaceX–EchoStar) highlight confidence and consolidation.

But red flags are everywhere — CEO terminations (KMX), client losses (ONIT), and dividend suspensions (CCOI, BLMN) hint at real distress.

**Bottom Line:** Today’s filings are a crash course in reading corporate signals. From billion-dollar insider sales to record buybacks and CEO ousters, these moves reveal where smart money thinks tomorrow’s winners and losers will be.",1,1762529132.0,SECWatch,0,1.0,False

Little description of me:
I’m a College student so I’m busy at least a few hours each day. I’m a Short king (5’4”), with long hair and a goatee. I’m Nerdy, I like Star Wars, MTG, a few anime, Legos, and comic book characters. I have “Stereotypical white girl energy”: love my StarBs coffee, fall in love with every cute animal (especially birds), I’m a sucker for flowers and romantic movies. I will warn I’m a little clingy (I get attached to someone and will make them the center of my attention). I also have an anxious attachment style (basically I’m terrified I’m not good enough and thus overthink little things) so honestly and communication are priorities of mine in a relationship.

What I’m looking for:
Long term relationship, even if long distance/online. Preferably someone around my age: 19-26.
I want someone who can be loving, gentle and kind as well as someone willing to talk to me for hours on end. My “Type” varies based on gender: I like tough women (tomboys, witches and goths) and softer/feminine men, but I’ve been known to go outside of my types for a strong emotional connection. Either way I need someone compassionate and emotionally available. 

Thank you for reading, if you’re interested please DM me with your age, gender, pronouns and something interesting about yourself. 🩷💜💙",1,1762529048.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

My stare remained fixed to the ceiling, the rigidity of my body leaving the bed beneath me feeling like stone. One hand rested on Riley’s waist, the other stroked Luna’s scalp as they both slept against me. The sinister serenade of the coyotes earlier had awoken them, and they were now holding me much tighter so I couldn’t escape again.

As my fingers brushed through the dark brown and blue hairs on my sister’s head, the poor girl gently quivering beneath my palm, all I could think about was the words the witch had uttered.

*“Cut out your sister’s heart, drink her blood and her tears.”*

*“Do what your father could not.”*

I reached into the murky depths of my memory trying to recall if my father had ever reached out while we were in Seattle. If anyone had dropped some kind of hint or suggestion of us reconnecting. But nothing stood out.

There was one thing that came to me, something much more recent than I was looking for. From just a few days ago. When I had introduced myself and the girls to the neighbor. When I mentioned my father, he’d seemed surprised. Like he didn’t know Malcolm had a second son. Like he didn’t know he had a daughter.

My father never mentioned us to him. Why? If he was trying to become like him?

The uncomfortable thoughts and theories circling through my head made my skin crawl. Eventually I became too restless and, not wanting to wake the girls with my fidgeting, unfurled their arms from around me. But as I tried to wriggle out of bed, Riley’s hand gripped my wrist, her pleading eyes watery with worry. Luna shifted, gently mewling as she curled into a tighter ball while Riley and I had a silent conversation.

I leaned over, gently placing a kiss on her temple, the warmth of her soft skin quelling that roiling ocean within me. “I’ll be back in a minute. I promise” I whispered, squeezing her forearm.

She let out an anxious breath, her brows dipping as she released me, cuddling close to Luna as she watched me leave the room. I reached the top of the stairs and began to hear hushed conversation from the lower floor.

I took a few steps down trying to listen in when Wes’ voice roared. “No!” The fury within the outburst made me flinch. There were a few beats of silence until their talking continued.

“Just think it through, Wes” Ben’s voice half whispered. “You heard the way it was talking. He’s old. Possibly centuries. We don’t have the manpower or the medicine to take that on by ourselves.”

My uncle growled loudly, his pacing steps hard enough to shake the wall beside me. “This is *our* land. *Our* people. *Our* problem to handle.”

“He killed a fucking priest!” Ben exclaimed.

Wes scoffed. “Lawence? There’s no way that drunk was part of the Inquisition.”

“It doesn’t matter” Ben hissed. “He was a priest. They will investigate his death. And when they find out we knew and didn’t report it, we’re all fucked. Their trust is much easier to lose than it is to gain. You really wanna give them an excuse to raise their presence here? How’s that gonna be for *our people*?”

A span of tense but pensive silence passed. “And what happens when they decide Aage and Luna are exposure risks.”

“They won’t.”

“They might.”

Again, a long silence elapsed. “I can’t risk my niece and nephew, Ben” Wes breathed. “I owe it to Elinor to get them out of this.”

Ben let out a frustrated murmur. “Fine.” I heard him drop onto the couch. “But we can’t fight this thing ourselves. So, how about this. We put together enough protections to we get us out of here. Cut and run. Then I’ll make a call to my Inquisition contact. Let them handle the dirty business. And I’ll leave their names out of it.”

“It’s over an hour’s drive no matter where we go” Wes replied. “With six people, I don’t know if we have enough of anything.”

Ben spat a curse. “Alright, let’s just take some time. Come up with a plan. For tonight, I’ll take first watch. You two get some rest.”

A deep orange was just beginning to line the horizon when I came downstairs again. My eyelids felt heavy, my bones felt hollow, my flesh felt deflated. My whole soul was tired. With everything that’d happened in such a short time, I was drained of energy, of spirit… of hope. I just felt empty.

I dragged my feet past Ben and Elvis, the old man lying on the ground asleep on a mat while his son messed with the guns and bullets on the countertops, murmuring a song too quiet for me to parse. I paid them no mind and Ben returned that effort.

My uncle was slumped on the couch in the living room, his eyes thoughtfully staring into nothingness. He’d taken his jacket off, leaving his forearms exposed with his t-shirt. On his left bicep was a colorful tattoo of a tremendous bird with lighting exploding around it, the Thunderbird. The sight of it brought a slew of happy memories from my time with him when I was a kid.

His gaze snapped to me once I got close and he wiped the despondency from his features before attempting a smile.

“What’s he doing now?” I asked, tipping my head towards Ben.

Wes took off his Stetson and placed it on the coffee table. “Using the sacred ash to bless our weapons and bullets. So they can pass through whatever protections the witch has.”

I didn’t really have anything to add to that, so I just shrugged and dropped onto the couch beside him.

“Get any sleep?” he asked.

“Nope” I sighed, my head lolling back against the couch. “But I haven’t been sleeping much anyway, even before all this spooky shit. There’s no rest to be had in this house.”

Wes seemed to ponder that, a blanket of silence washing over us until he spoke again. “Y’know I…” He bit his tongue, seeming to reconsider his wording. “I’ve always wanted to apologize to you for, y’know, not doing anything. Back then.”

I shrugged, my gaze lingering on the hole in the wall that led to the protective spell below us. “What could you have done? It’s not like mom ever had the guts to leave his ass. She didn’t want to be saved.” Wes let out a noncommittal sound. I rolled my head over to look at him, my brows furrowing with thought. “There is one thing though.” He looked at me. “Why did you stop visiting? Going to the Rez with you was some of the best days of my childhood. So, why did it stop?”

Grief hijacked his facial features as he sank further into the couch. “Your mother never told you?” I shook my head. “I guess you were too young to understand. Your mother told me to stop coming by.”

My frown deepened. “Why?”

He sighed through his broad nostrils. “I fell into the drink. Like our father did. It had something to do with being unable to protect her and… a few other things. I couldn’t get out of that particular monster’s hold.” He sniffed and dragged a hand over his face as he sat up, idly reaching for his hat to fiddle with. “The last time I saw you. I’d just lost my job. Been drinking all night. I forgot I was supposed to pick you boys up so, I was still drunk when I got here.”

“Shit. I remember that” I mused. “Yeah, I remember you acting funny, and driving bad. I thought it was just you playing a weird joke or something.”

Wes pumped his brows, his lips pressing together as he gently shook his head. “You were young enough to still think all adults knew best. Oscar, I think, saw right through it. Must’ve been him who told your mother.” He let out a dry mournful chuckle. “She let me have it. Away from you two of course. But you should’ve seen her, I’d never seen fury like that before, or since. And your mother was a sweet woman, but she knew how to cut deep. Said I was acting like our father. He was a drunk too. Had half a dozen kids with just as many women. I was becoming him.” His voice broke, forcing him to clear his throat and swallow. “She told me to not come by anymore, that I was no good to be around you boys. She was right, so I listened. Figured it was for the best. But… now. I wonder if maybe, if I had had the strength to pull myself together, if maybe I’d been able to do something. Maybe they’d both still be alive.” A wetness lined his eyes, his voice straining as he held in the anguish bubbling up in his chest. “I’m sorry, kid.”

I watched him for a few moments before shrugging. “The past is the past. Can’t change it. Ain’t no point in dwelling on it” I muttered.

Wes scoffed. “Hypocrite.”

The two of us shared a chuckle that seemed to loosen some of the tension that’d been gnawing through my torso. Then Riley’s screams ripped through the house.

Adrenaline flooded my veins as I shot off the couch and flew up the stairs. I didn’t pause for a moment to even check that the others were following, I just beelined for our bedroom.

Bursting into the room, pulse throbbing in my temples, I found Riley on our bed, thrashing around like she was on fire, screaming so hard I could see the cords of muscle in her throat bulging. I hopped up onto the mattress beside her, gripping her shoulders in a vain attempt to restrain her, her legs kicking out, her hands clawing at herself leaving red stripes across her pale skin.

“Riley, wake up” I called desperately, unable to even hear myself, her lips painted crimson as her screaming brought up drops of blood. Her muscles were tensing so hard I worried her bones would break beneath the pressure. I looked back at Wes behind me. “What’s happening?” I barked. “Is it a dream? You said the catchers would prevent this!”

A sickening sensation rolled through my gut when I saw the color drain from my uncle’s face. “That’s no dream.”

Ben and Elvis appeared in the doorway and Wes immediately barked orders for them to retrieve things.

In my panic I hadn’t thought of my sister, only remembering her presence when my gaze found her in the corner of the room, her hands over her ears, her face coated with tears.

“Take her out of here” I commanded. Wes didn’t argue, quickly picking Luna up and carrying her out, murmuring into her ear about how things were going to be okay, unable to channel any truth into his tone.

Blood was seeping from the edges of Riley’s eyes when Ben and Elvis finally returned, Elvis with his drum and Ben with the ceremonial ashes. “Hold her still” Ben ordered as Elvis lit up a bundle of sage and sweetgrass, waving the smudge stick over Riley to bathe her in the earthy smelling smoke. I did as I was instructed and Ben began smearing the ash across Riley’s body. Her belly, her arms, her neck, her face, her legs, every part of her was donned with a dark gray hand smear. Elvis in the meanwhile began beating his drum, and singing a song similar to the one he’d bellowed when cleansing my soul of the corpse powder.

It took a few minutes, though it felt like lifetimes, but Riley’s screaming eventually began to ease. Her eyelids fluttered, her muscles finally loosened, and she fell into a deep sleep, scarlet droplets spilling down the side of her face from her eyes, mouth and nostrils.

Now that she was still, I truly took her in. She’d become deathly pale, corpselike. The veins beneath her paper skin had turned a deep sickly purple, growing darker on her temples. As she shivered, I realized how cold she felt, flesh of ice. Her breaths were shallow as they secreted from her bloodied lips.

“What is this?” The question came out of me as a choked sob. Ben tried to grab my arm and gently pull me back but I yanked myself from his grip. “Get the fuck off me” I yelled, not taking my eyes off the woman I loved.

“You need to let her rest” he said quietly, Elvis’ chants quieting into a steady hum.

Tears beaded on my lashes as I lifted a hand to her face, gently stroking her cheek with my thumb. “What the fuck is this?”

Ben sighed through his nostrils. “She’s been cursed.”

I looked back at him. “Then heal her. Like you did with me.”

“It’s not that simple” he replied.

“Why the fuck not?” I snarled as I stood, taking a stride towards him.

He stepped back, raising a finger to me as his eyes took on a note of warning. “This is different. The witch must have some part of her. Hair, nail clippings, something that he has attached the curse to. All we can do is soothe her, slow it down. But we can’t cure it here.”

My lips moved wordlessly for a spell, my mind racing as I digested what he was telling me. “How did… how could he have…” Something evil slithered down my spine as I put things together. “Her hairbrush… She lost her hairbrush. He must’ve…”

My chest tightened to an agonizing degree, strangling me until I had to gasp for air, bracing on the dresser.

Ben was by my side again. “My father’s ceremony will halt the curse’s effects for a while. But she needs to rest.”

I pulled back the emotions threatening to cleave me in two and nodded, leaving the room to return to the kitchen downstairs. My fists shook at my sides, the fiery heat of wrath working through me. “Fuck!” I roared, kicking a chair hard enough to send it sailing across the room.

Air hissed through my teeth, as my mind reeled for what to do. I could hear Luna crying in the other room, but my instincts to comfort her were overwhelmed by every other horrible sensation boring into me.

Ben and Wes appeared around me and I turned to them, whatever resided in my eyes giving my uncle pause. “What do we do?” I demanded.

Ben sighed, rubbing his jaw. “The only way to dispel the curse is to destroy its effigy.”

“And where’s that?”

He hesitated, looking to my uncle who shook his head. “Most likely in the shapeshifter’s lair” he answered anyway.

I thought for a moment, letting resignation wash over me and cool my simmering bloodstream. “Alright then” I murmured as I turned to the guns on the counter.

“Nephew” my uncle called as I began loading shells into a shotgun. “Think this through. He’s trying to lure you out of safety. You’ll be walking straight into an ambush. This is what he wants you to do.”

“Well, I’d hate to disappoint” I replied, racking the shotgun and packing a couple handfuls of shells into my pockets.

“Kid, you’re going to get killed” Wes exclaimed when I began marching towards the front door.

I turned on a heel suddenly, almost causing him to walk into me. “Then tell me there’s another way. Tell me how else to save her.” My voice broke, my eyes growing misty with my pleas.

Wes’ words died on his lips, his eyes falling to the ground. I moved my stare to Ben who just shrugged.

“Yeah” I breathed, moving to turn back to the door, but catching sight of Luna crying in the living room made me pause. I looked back to my uncle. “I need you to promise me, if I don’t come back, you’ll get Luna out of here.”

“Kid…”

“Fucking promise me, Wes!” I yelled, grabbing his shirt to force him to look me in the eye.

He hesitated, but eventually nodded. “I promise. I’ll get her out of here, no matter what.”

I pulled in a breath to steady myself, the weight of the stone resting in my gullet adding to the pressure in my chest. I exhaled before turning to the door again.

“Aage” Wes called out as my hand gripped the handle. “Your mother would be proud.”

I chewed on the statement down to the bone before finally replying. “No, she wouldn’t.”

Cold wind lashed around me as distant yips sounded. My eyes scanned the horizon as I stepped down from the porch, catching sight of several coyotes ducking behind various foliage.

I closed my eyes and pulled in a lungful breath, the dust kicked up by the breeze bitter in my nostrils. A collection of crows cawed from their perch on the roof of the house, something strangely invigorating about the sound.

Using the clear icy air to keep senses sharp, I began marching towards the shack. I saw more and more flickers of movement out the corner of my eye, hearing the low rumbling growl of a mountain lion somewhere. The preparations of that ambush Wes had predicted. My hands, palms slick with sweat, tightened their grip on the shotgun, my finger stroking the trigger with each buzz of anticipation licking the back of my neck.

I was almost at the edge of the property when I heard the scuff of rushing steps behind me. I spun around only to find it was Ben, a rifle in his arms.

My face pinched as I lowered the gun. “What the hell are you doing?”

“What? You’re the only one who gets to play hero? Fuck you” he replied wryly, releasing the charging handle of his rifle.

I chuckled and together, the two of us crossed the property line and began our trek towards the belly of the beast.

The moment we passed that invisible line, a cacophony of coyote howls exploded around us. A hellish war cry.

Ben shouldered his rifle, his gaze sharp as he scanned our surroundings. A prolonged whistle sounded, washing my shoulders with a terrible chill. The same whistle I’d heard my first night here, when that bastard had walked me out into the desert. He was watching our approach. I could feel it in my bones.

Patting the medicine pouch hanging around my neck to remind myself we were better protected now, I advanced.

A coyote suddenly darted out from behind a brittlebush, but I was quick, raising my weapon and blowing open the animal’s throat, cutting off its howl and sending it sprawling to the dirt. Several pops pierced the ringing in my ears as Ben picked a few off from a distance, the survivors scattering and taking cover behind rocks and cacti.

Another two coyotes charged us. I fired three shots that cut them down, but before I could rack the next shell, I saw movement beside the rock I’d just passed. A mountain lion roared as it pounced at me, catching me by surprise. I cried out as its fangs sank into the forearm I used to protect my neck, the beast’s weight dragging me to the ground making me drop my gun.

The lion ripped its teeth from my flesh, the crimson fangs glinting in the light of the sunrise as it prepared to lunge for my throat again. But a bullet halted its efforts when it tore through its shoulder. The lion stumbled as another shot hit it in the side. A third blew through its hip dropping it to the ground, and Ben stepped over me, bringing a boot down onto the lion’s neck before planting three more shots into its skull to be sure it was dead.

“You alright?” he asked me.

I pushed myself to my knees and watched the rivulets of blood curl around my wrist and drip from my fingertips. I struggled to move my middle and index fingers, but the others were able to sustain a shaky grip. I didn’t answer the question, I just picked up the shotgun, using it to push myself up, and gritted my teeth from the pain of racking my next shell.

Ben loaded another magazine as I shot down the coyotes that were guarding the large shack’s door. As we approached the building, Ben let off a few more shots at the coyotes behind us.

The door of the shack was a cobbled together piece of sheet metal, wedged into an opening with no handle. I used the shotgun to blast away the rusty hinges and bust it down with a well-placed couple of kicks. A foul smell poured from the entry bringing bile to my throat making me grimace and instinctively cover my nose. The stench of rot. The stench of death.

It was almost pitch-black inside the shack, what light the rising sun gifted struggling to make it far inside. But from what I could see, there were two twisting hallways. One directly ahead, seemingly ramping upwards a little, and one straight to the right, with a corner into blackness after about ten feet.

I turned to help hold off the rest of the approaching coyotes, but when I did, those that remained turned and ran, disappearing into the distance.

Ben and I looked at each other, taking a breath to collect ourselves and reload. Looking into the shack again, the familiar whistling emanated from the darkness and somehow, I knew it was the witch’s way of beckoning us inside.

As soon as I stepped in, an icy chill stroked the nape of my neck, like a breath exhaled from the lips of a corpse. My skin prickled and my heart shuddered, the ringing in my ears overwhelming my senses for a few moments before Ben tapped my arm.

Silently, he pointed to himself then to the hallway ahead, then he pointed to me and the hallway to our right. “We need to move fast, call out when you find it.”

“I don’t know what I’m looking for” I replied.

“You’ll know it when you see it.” And he began to advance into the hallway, his gun up and ready.

Hissing a curse, but keeping Riley in the forefront of my mind, I moved. Slowly while my eyes adjusted to the dark, my shoulder and back against the right-side wall, I pushed into the darkness. Beneath the ringing in my ears, I began to hear things. The rattling of claws against metal. Heavy breathing through sharp bared teeth. Manic cackling spewed from a dry raspy throat. Whispers. Murmurings of violence, of violations against me and the people I love. Then it became voices I knew.

“Aage…”

My sister’s quiet murmur sent a shiver through my nervous system, my breath trembling with each slow step I took down that stygian hallway. The blood dripping from my arm left a trail behind me, my thread in this labyrinth.

“You said this was a fresh start.”

“Are we going to die?”

“I want to go home.”

Through the darkness I saw a flash of eyes and a smile, glowing like a cat’s does in headlights. I fired my shotgun, dirt flying up as the buckshot tore apart the wall, each pull of the pump sending agony through my arm. I heard the scuttling feet as the figure ran further into the hallway, laughing.

“I’m scared, Aage” Riley’s voice whimpered in the dark.

Then her screams began to echo, underlined by manic raspy laughter, digging into my mind and making the shadows darker. Each corner I turned, I spotted a flash of movement down the hallway, disappearing around the next bend.

“What’s going to happen to us?”

“I wish we never came here.”

“I don’t want to die.”

Guilt gnawed at the base of my skull, tightening around my throat. I turned another corner and a mass of about a dozen owls suddenly lunged at me. I threw myself backwards, crying out as razor talons slashed across my face almost blinding me. Another set sliced into my chest and my foot slipped. I felt the leather string of the medicine pouch snap as I fell to the ground.

I shot my eyes after the flurry of wings now dashing down the hallway I’d just come from, seeing the pouch swinging around within the flock. I quickly sat up, blood pouring from the gash below my right eye, and aimed, following the tiny baggy as the owls made for the corner. My heart was pounding as I knew if I lost that medicine I was fucked.

Finally, I pulled the trigger, just as the owls reached the corner, seeing a bust of feathers fly as one of the birds fell with a squawk. The rest of them disappeared behind the corner.

My gaze snapped back to the path ahead of me, meeting the predatory eyes of the witch as he crouched down by the next turn. Still naked barring a coyote’s skin on his head and bone charms dangling from his sagging skin. His crooked smile was cheek splittingly wide, his slit pupils piercing through the shadows to stab at my heart.

Immediately I turned my gun on him and fired, but a coyote leapt from around the corner to take the shot for him. As I struggled to rack my next shell, the witch laughed, standing and melting into the darkness again.

A single sob escaped me as I pushed myself up, my vision blurring as I wiped tears and blood from my eyes. I wanted to just lay down, even if it meant death. But I couldn’t. I had to keep going.

I stumbled back up the hallway to the owl I’d shot down, murmuring pleas as I sifted through the feathers, relief flowing from me when I found the little pouch. Blood dripped from my chin from the gashes in my face and soaked into my shirt from my chest as I retied the medicine around my neck, grabbing a few owl feathers just because.

I pushed onward, loading more shotgun shells as I moved.

Then I heard Ben’s voice.

“Y’know this is stupid right?”

“These white folk never stand a fucking chance.”

“Staying here to help them, it’s gonna get us killed too.”

“Hell, at this point, getting killed by the Inquisition might be a mercy.”

The metallic taste of blood coated my tongue, my quivering arms struggling to keep my weapon raised. The rotten fetor of death had fully submerged me, staining me and clouding my mind with fear. The sounds of footsteps echoed around me, joined by the occasional bout of mocking laughter and scrape of a knife on steel.

Wes’ voice then began.

“He was a nice kid back then. He’s so different now.”

“He’s got his father’s anger, that’s for sure.”

“I’m worried about how else he might be like Malcolm.”

I turned another corner and saw light, yellow and flickering like that of a candle. I had to be reaching the end of this maze. That whistle again beamed through the place, stroking my skin with a sickening sensation.

Reaching the next corner, I turned just in time to see the witch’s scrawny figure scurry up the left side wall. I fired a shot, but hit only dirt as he forced his body through a narrow gap in the ceiling, laughing as he disappeared from view.

I then felt something in my chest sink when my father’s voice drifted across my ears.

“You have no power here.”

“You’re weak.”

“You couldn’t save anyone.”

“You can’t do anything.”

“You’ll always be alone. Just like me.”

Hearing his voice again after all these years felt like having my heart carved out of my chest. I staggered, flinching like he was about to strike me, like I was a helpless child again at the mercy of a spiteful man, who couldn’t stop that man from destroying the only woman who cared about me. My breath caught and I couldn’t stop the sob from tearing from my lips.

I pulled my breathing back under control and gritted my teeth as my eyes tracked to the flickering light ahead. I was a helpless kid no longer, and I proved that to myself by racking another shell before pushing forward.

Following the light, the stench of decay reached an all-time high as I finally made it into another room. I jolted when catching what I thought was the outline of a man out the corner of my eye. Turning to aim my weapon, I realized what it truly was.

Skin. Hanging from a bone rack like a coat. White bloody skin, spread out and displayed. A hunter’s trophy.

While empty and deflated, I could still see the shape of his face clear as day. Inside it, symbols had been drawn with ash, some part of the spell that allowed the wearer to become the person they wore. I stumbled away from it, vomit climbing up my gullet. When I saw the dark clothes of a priest lying beside it, I knew who the skin belonged to.

Not wanting to see the ghastly sight any longer, I walked away, stepping into a small room with candles flickering all around. In the center was a circle, not unlike the one found below my house, though instead of ash and tobacco, it was made of gray bones and old brown blood. Along the walls were dozens of pelts, most animal, a couple human, all baring those same ashen symbols.

Approaching the circle, I analyzed the ornament in the middle, made from sticks and animal bones, and hair. Blue hair. It had to be the effigy.

I kicked away some of the bone in the circle before stomping down on the effigy. Crouching, I tore away and snapped the twigs, yanking free every hair I could and tucking them into my pocket.

Once I destroyed every part of it, I stood, hoping beyond hope I’d done it correctly. One last look around, I noticed a collection of jars in a rusty shopping cart in the corner.

The jars held a variety of items. Teeth, bones, trinkets like children’s toys and jewelry, dried ears, tongues, hair. I scanned them all and eventually found one that housed a plastic hairbrush, several long blue hairs still clinging to the bristles.

I grabbed the jar and turned to leave, but a thought hit me. I looked around at the wooden beams holding up the ceiling. I scanned all the twigs and string scattered all around. And I turned to the candles.

Moving quickly, I grabbed up anything and everything that could be flammable. Sticks, string, hair, clothing. Scattering everything and piling things up until I was happy it’d burn well. Then I used one of the candles to light it up. It wasn’t a quick burn, but it was enough to hopefully provide a distraction and aid our getaway.

Finally, I left that infernal room, running back down the winding hallway, smoke following behind and choking my voice as I yelled. “Ben! I got it, let’s go!”

I was expecting to get attacked. For the shadows to suddenly lunge out and grab me. But I made it all the way back to the front door without incident.

Panting, I yelled down the other path. “Ben come on! I got it, let’s get the fuck outta here!”

The silence was louder than any gunshot as I stared into that dark hallway, smoke beginning to cloud the ceiling and clog my throat. My lips parted to call out again, but Ben beat me to it.

“Help!” he cried, followed by some gunshots.

I cursed, taking a step forward as more gunshots rang.

“Aage, Help me! Fuck!” More gunshots, then he started screaming. “Help me! Aage!” His screams grew louder, the witch’s manic laugh joining his cries as I heard a loud crash.

I moved to run but stopped. My eyes trailed down to the jar with Riley’s brush still in my hand. I looked back at the daylight streaming in from the front door. If I died here, he’d still have Riley’s hair and it’d all be for nothing.

I looked back down the hallway, the wet sound of snapping bone preceding Ben’s next bloodcurdling scream. “Aage! Help me! Please! Please fucking help me.” Desperation made his weakening voice hoarse, the witch’s sadistic mocking cries underlining each thumping strike.

My head lowered, shame prickling in my flesh as I murmured “I’m sorry” before leaving out the door.

Ben’s cries followed me as I fled, growing quieter with distance, until I made it to the property line, and he fell painfully quiet, as did the entire world.

No coyotes were nearby. No bugs. No birds. Just the chafing quiet of death. The ringing in my ears. And the witch’s prolonged whistle.

Blood and phlegm coated my throat by the time I got back to the house, the jog taking what was left of my energy. I almost collapsed on the steps, spitting up some vomit as my bloodied dirty limps trembled.

Wes burst through the door, cursing as he crouched down to help me. “Holy shit kid. You did it.”

“I got it” I wheezed, holding up the jar. “I got it all.”

“Yeah, you did” Wes confirmed, taking hold of my arms to help me. “The curse passed a few minutes ago. She’s gonna be okay. You saved her.” Wes then glanced around. “Where’s Ben?”

I looked up, staring past my uncle at Elvis, the look in my eye stealing the air from his lungs. “I’m sorry” I breathed, unable to keep eye contact with him as Elvis staggered, bracing himself on the wall. His eyes grew red and misty as he lowered into the same porch chair I’d sat in while Ben explained to me that he was all Elvis had.

And there Elvis sat, until the sun went down again.

\-

With Ben gone and Elvis grief-stricken, Wes was doing most of the preparations by himself. I could’ve helped, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave Riley’s side. Not that I would be much help anyway with my left arm bandaged, the hand almost useless thanks to the witch’s mountain lion.

Riley hadn’t woken up yet, though Wes told me that was normal. She still looked sickly, dried blood still encrusted on her face, ash still smeared across her body. But the corrupted darkness had left her veins and she was breathing deeply. She was going to be alright.

I’d been sat with her practically the whole time since returning, her head on my lap as I stroked her hair, watching through the window the witch’s shack get slowly engulfed by the flames I’d set on my way out. It’d reduced to just a pile of metal and embers by the time the sky darkened again.

Night eventually fell, and I was idly fiddling with one of the owl feathers I’d picked up, when I heard a scream outside. “Aage!”

My eyes shot to the window, every part of me tensing as if anticipating an impact.

No, it couldn’t be…

“Aage! Help me!”

It was Ben’s voice.

I carefully laid Riley off my lap, grabbing my 1911 and heading downstairs. Stepping out onto the porch, I saw him, standing far off, his dark silhouette blending into the night sky.

“Help me! Please! Please fucking help me” he continued to scream, standing unnervingly still with his arms by his sides, staring directly at me.

I took a step forward but a hand grabbed my arm. I looked back to find Elvis, still sat where he’d fallen when I returned without his son. His eyes were hazy, moonlight shining in the moisture that’d collected in the creases of his cheeks.

His grip was firm as he shook his head, a broken sound escaping his lips as he sucked in a pained breath.

“Help me! Aage! Fuck! Please help me!” the broken imitation of Ben continued.

I looked back to the witch, and though the dark shrouded him completely, I swore I could still see him smiling at me.

I thrusted my gun forward, but before I could pull the trigger, he ducked down and scuttled away on all fours.

“Aage! Please! Help me! Help me, Aage!” it continued as he disappeared into the night. Repeating Ben’s final words, the voice sounding from all around us but never relenting, never stopping for a moment for the entire rest of the night.

As I laid beside Riley later, for hours, it went on with the unanswered pleas.

“Aage! Please! Please fucking help me.”

And I was sure I would forever hear them in my nightmares.

This is the reason it's so important to pick up after yourselves and keep nature clean. River otters are making a comeback on the lakeshore and its a good sign that pollution levels are getting better.

If you can, take some time to pick up litter, even if you're out with your kids or walking your dog (for cleanliness I'd purchase a trash picker / grabber if you're worried).

I'm(19M) writing this on 10:17 pm 7th November 2025.

One of my new friend(27F) that I met today on reddit decides to video call me because she had panic attack.

She expressed her concerned to me about how her heart felt when she had panic attack.

The sunken and compressed heart shattered my heart,unlocked my memories and it bring back the traumatizing past

that happen to me when I was 12yo boy.

The way she explained it felt deeper as her audio and video quality drops (still can hear but the texture of her voice kinda scary and it felt too real)

It reminds me of how I witness something that a 12yo boy shouldn't see which is...

my mother was beaten by my dad,the wardrobe and LG TV was punched to a point where it it has dent,like a meteor hit the surface of the Earth.

My mother once told me how my dad almost crash a car,burn the house ,slapped her,broke the fan,the glass,the cups,the yelling and broke the kitchen tile with a gas tank.

I saw my dad punch my mother's butt, broke the kitchen tile with a gas tank,slapped her,

called her names(not gonna go in details but you get the idea),broke a plate just because her cooking was wrong,break the cup of coffee that I made for him just because the milk is less.

It is very easy for him to break things in the house including my heart and my perception of reality. Back then I thought what he did was normal which is to scold my mother,

even though I felt sad at that time but my stupid brain somehow laugh at my mother because

I thought it was just my father ""disciplining"" my mother just like how she did it to me.This happen prob when I was 7-9(I don't really remember).

After the video call ended,I started to cry and said ""why did this happen to me"".

I laid down on the bed alone in my dorm room.

As I close my eyes with my hand,the image of my memories buried deep into my brain appeared

in form of black image that represent what had happen.

I was sitting on the floor and laid back behind thick mattresses while witnessing my dad beat up mother,punch the tv,destroyed the fan,the yelling,etc.

Bare in mind,this happen when I was 12yo and somehow I manage to go through with it and end up with a 3A 3B for my UPSR.

Sometimes I wonder how did I manage to survive messed up childhood while maintaining good grades(I know 3A is not a lot but lets be real,its good enough)

Thank goodness I got 7A for SPM even though I play play only. At least I have something to be proud of which is my grades that do nothing cuz I end up in poli anyway. LMAO

Extra note :

Even worse,yesterday I watch a blackpill edit and almost cried because of it.

Blackpill is about how looks matter in a lot of times but it can be about how you can't change things because it's the way they are,

for example you intelligence,your social class/status/caste,amount of wealth,privilege that set up my success and health.

In this case, I used to get bullied for my mix raced background(my dad is an pakistani immigrant),

a doctor(woman) laugh/smile/giggle(whatever la) at my man boobs when I was 11yo while other male doctors just

being neutral(no expression on their face),my dad called my an idiot and fat like a cow.

I often hear arguments about low paying jobs as ""starter jobs"" or some other variation of the same idea. It's used to justify the poverty wages that people are paid, that their job is too inconsequential to be paid anything other than the bare minimum they are legally required to be. 

I am sure that at least 99.9% of people who think like this enjoy things like fast food, movies, coffee, and numerous other things that are only part of our society because of every day working people. Not to mention, someone **has** to do some of these jobs for society to function. 

Quit infantilizing people, quit putting them down. There is nothing wrong with working at a grocery store, there is nothing wrong with just being a productive member of society. Not everyone should have to jump through hoops and be a lawyer/surgeon/engineer in order to have a comfortable life.

My stare remained fixed to the ceiling, the rigidity of my body leaving the bed beneath me feeling like stone. One hand rested on Riley’s waist, the other stroked Luna’s scalp as they both slept against me. The sinister serenade of the coyotes earlier had awoken them, and they were now holding me much tighter so I couldn’t escape again.

As my fingers brushed through the dark brown and blue hairs on my sister’s head, the poor girl gently quivering beneath my palm, all I could think about was the words the witch had uttered.

*“Cut out your sister’s heart, drink her blood and her tears.”*

*“Do what your father could not.”*

I reached into the murky depths of my memory trying to recall if my father had ever reached out while we were in Seattle. If anyone had dropped some kind of hint or suggestion of us reconnecting. But nothing stood out.

There was one thing that came to me, something much more recent than I was looking for. From just a few days ago. When I had introduced myself and the girls to the neighbor. When I mentioned my father, he’d seemed surprised. Like he didn’t know Malcolm had a second son. Like he didn’t know he had a daughter.

My father never mentioned us to him. Why? If he was trying to become like him?

The uncomfortable thoughts and theories circling through my head made my skin crawl. Eventually I became too restless and, not wanting to wake the girls with my fidgeting, unfurled their arms from around me. But as I tried to wriggle out of bed, Riley’s hand gripped my wrist, her pleading eyes watery with worry. Luna shifted, gently mewling as she curled into a tighter ball while Riley and I had a silent conversation.

I leaned over, gently placing a kiss on her temple, the warmth of her soft skin quelling that roiling ocean within me. “I’ll be back in a minute. I promise” I whispered, squeezing her forearm.

She let out an anxious breath, her brows dipping as she released me, cuddling close to Luna as she watched me leave the room. I reached the top of the stairs and began to hear hushed conversation from the lower floor.

I took a few steps down trying to listen in when Wes’ voice roared. “No!” The fury within the outburst made me flinch. There were a few beats of silence until their talking continued.

“Just think it through, Wes” Ben’s voice half whispered. “You heard the way it was talking. He’s old. Possibly centuries. We don’t have the manpower or the medicine to take that on by ourselves.”

My uncle growled loudly, his pacing steps hard enough to shake the wall beside me. “This is *our* land. *Our* people. *Our* problem to handle.”

“He killed a fucking priest!” Ben exclaimed.

Wes scoffed. “Lawence? There’s no way that drunk was part of the Inquisition.”

“It doesn’t matter” Ben hissed. “He was a priest. They will investigate his death. And when they find out we knew and didn’t report it, we’re all fucked. Their trust is much easier to lose than it is to gain. You really wanna give them an excuse to raise their presence here? How’s that gonna be for *our people*?”

A span of tense but pensive silence passed. “And what happens when they decide Aage and Luna are exposure risks.”

“They won’t.”

“They might.”

Again, a long silence elapsed. “I can’t risk my niece and nephew, Ben” Wes breathed. “I owe it to Elinor to get them out of this.”

Ben let out a frustrated murmur. “Fine.” I heard him drop onto the couch. “But we can’t fight this thing ourselves. So, how about this. We put together enough protections to we get us out of here. Cut and run. Then I’ll make a call to my Inquisition contact. Let them handle the dirty business. And I’ll leave their names out of it.”

“It’s over an hour’s drive no matter where we go” Wes replied. “With six people, I don’t know if we have enough of anything.”

Ben spat a curse. “Alright, let’s just take some time. Come up with a plan. For tonight, I’ll take first watch. You two get some rest.”

\-

A deep orange was just beginning to line the horizon when I came downstairs again. My eyelids felt heavy, my bones felt hollow, my flesh felt deflated. My whole soul was tired. With everything that’d happened in such a short time, I was drained of energy, of spirit… of hope. I just felt empty.

I dragged my feet past Ben and Elvis, the old man lying on the ground asleep on a mat while his son messed with the guns and bullets on the countertops, murmuring a song too quiet for me to parse. I paid them no mind and Ben returned that effort.

My uncle was slumped on the couch in the living room, his eyes thoughtfully staring into nothingness. He’d taken his jacket off, leaving his forearms exposed with his t-shirt. On his left bicep was a colorful tattoo of a tremendous bird with lighting exploding around it, the Thunderbird. The sight of it brought a slew of happy memories from my time with him when I was a kid.

His gaze snapped to me once I got close and he wiped the despondency from his features before attempting a smile.

“What’s he doing now?” I asked, tipping my head towards Ben.

Wes took off his Stetson and placed it on the coffee table. “Using the sacred ash to bless our weapons and bullets. So they can pass through whatever protections the witch has.”

I didn’t really have anything to add to that, so I just shrugged and dropped onto the couch beside him.

“Get any sleep?” he asked.

“Nope” I sighed, my head lolling back against the couch. “But I haven’t been sleeping much anyway, even before all this spooky shit. There’s no rest to be had in this house.”

Wes seemed to ponder that, a blanket of silence washing over us until he spoke again. “Y’know I…” He bit his tongue, seeming to reconsider his wording. “I’ve always wanted to apologize to you for, y’know, not doing anything. Back then.”

I shrugged, my gaze lingering on the hole in the wall that led to the protective spell below us. “What could you have done? It’s not like mom ever had the guts to leave his ass. She didn’t want to be saved.” Wes let out a noncommittal sound. I rolled my head over to look at him, my brows furrowing with thought. “There is one thing though.” He looked at me. “Why did you stop visiting? Going to the Rez with you was some of the best days of my childhood. So, why did it stop?”

Grief hijacked his facial features as he sank further into the couch. “Your mother never told you?” I shook my head. “I guess you were too young to understand. Your mother told me to stop coming by.”

My frown deepened. “Why?”

He sighed through his broad nostrils. “I fell into the drink. Like our father did. It had something to do with being unable to protect her and… a few other things. I couldn’t get out of that particular monster’s hold.” He sniffed and dragged a hand over his face as he sat up, idly reaching for his hat to fiddle with. “The last time I saw you. I’d just lost my job. Been drinking all night. I forgot I was supposed to pick you boys up so, I was still drunk when I got here.”

“Shit. I remember that” I mused. “Yeah, I remember you acting funny, and driving bad. I thought it was just you playing a weird joke or something.”

Wes pumped his brows, his lips pressing together as he gently shook his head. “You were young enough to still think all adults knew best. Oscar, I think, saw right through it. Must’ve been him who told your mother.” He let out a dry mournful chuckle. “She let me have it. Away from you two of course. But you should’ve seen her, I’d never seen fury like that before, or since. And your mother was a sweet woman, but she knew how to cut deep. Said I was acting like our father. He was a drunk too. Had half a dozen kids with just as many women. I was becoming him.” His voice broke, forcing him to clear his throat and swallow. “She told me to not come by anymore, that I was no good to be around you boys. She was right, so I listened. Figured it was for the best. But… now. I wonder if maybe, if I had had the strength to pull myself together, if maybe I’d been able to do something. Maybe they’d both still be alive.” A wetness lined his eyes, his voice straining as he held in the anguish bubbling up in his chest. “I’m sorry, kid.”

I watched him for a few moments before shrugging. “The past is the past. Can’t change it. Ain’t no point in dwelling on it” I muttered.

Wes scoffed. “Hypocrite.”

The two of us shared a chuckle that seemed to loosen some of the tension that’d been gnawing through my torso. Then Riley’s screams ripped through the house.

Adrenaline flooded my veins as I shot off the couch and flew up the stairs. I didn’t pause for a moment to even check that the others were following, I just beelined for our bedroom.

Bursting into the room, pulse throbbing in my temples, I found Riley on our bed, thrashing around like she was on fire, screaming so hard I could see the cords of muscle in her throat bulging. I hopped up onto the mattress beside her, gripping her shoulders in a vain attempt to restrain her, her legs kicking out, her hands clawing at herself leaving red stripes across her pale skin.

“Riley, wake up” I called desperately, unable to even hear myself, her lips painted crimson as her screaming brought up drops of blood. Her muscles were tensing so hard I worried her bones would break beneath the pressure. I looked back at Wes behind me. “What’s happening?” I barked. “Is it a dream? You said the catchers would prevent this!”

A sickening sensation rolled through my gut when I saw the color drain from my uncle’s face. “That’s no dream.”

Ben and Elvis appeared in the doorway and Wes immediately barked orders for them to retrieve things.

In my panic I hadn’t thought of my sister, only remembering her presence when my gaze found her in the corner of the room, her hands over her ears, her face coated with tears.

“Take her out of here” I commanded. Wes didn’t argue, quickly picking Luna up and carrying her out, murmuring into her ear about how things were going to be okay, unable to channel any truth into his tone.

Blood was seeping from the edges of Riley’s eyes when Ben and Elvis finally returned, Elvis with his drum and Ben with the ceremonial ashes. “Hold her still” Ben ordered as Elvis lit up a bundle of sage and sweetgrass, waving the smudge stick over Riley to bathe her in the earthy smelling smoke. I did as I was instructed and Ben began smearing the ash across Riley’s body. Her belly, her arms, her neck, her face, her legs, every part of her was donned with a dark gray hand smear. Elvis in the meanwhile began beating his drum, and singing a song similar to the one he’d bellowed when cleansing my soul of the corpse powder.

It took a few minutes, though it felt like lifetimes, but Riley’s screaming eventually began to ease. Her eyelids fluttered, her muscles finally loosened, and she fell into a deep sleep, scarlet droplets spilling down the side of her face from her eyes, mouth and nostrils.

Now that she was still, I truly took her in. She’d become deathly pale, corpselike. The veins beneath her paper skin had turned a deep sickly purple, growing darker on her temples. As she shivered, I realized how cold she felt, flesh of ice. Her breaths were shallow as they secreted from her bloodied lips.

“What is this?” The question came out of me as a choked sob. Ben tried to grab my arm and gently pull me back but I yanked myself from his grip. “Get the fuck off me” I yelled, not taking my eyes off the woman I loved.

“You need to let her rest” he said quietly, Elvis’ chants quieting into a steady hum.

Tears beaded on my lashes as I lifted a hand to her face, gently stroking her cheek with my thumb. “What the fuck is this?”

Ben sighed through his nostrils. “She’s been cursed.”

I looked back at him. “Then heal her. Like you did with me.”

“It’s not that simple” he replied.

“Why the fuck not?” I snarled as I stood, taking a stride towards him.

He stepped back, raising a finger to me as his eyes took on a note of warning. “This is different. The witch must have some part of her. Hair, nail clippings, something that he has attached the curse to. All we can do is soothe her, slow it down. But we can’t cure it here.”

My lips moved wordlessly for a spell, my mind racing as I digested what he was telling me. “How did… how could he have…” Something evil slithered down my spine as I put things together. “Her hairbrush… She lost her hairbrush. He must’ve…”

My chest tightened to an agonizing degree, strangling me until I had to gasp for air, bracing on the dresser.

Ben was by my side again. “My father’s ceremony will halt the curse’s effects for a while. But she needs to rest.”

I pulled back the emotions threatening to cleave me in two and nodded, leaving the room to return to the kitchen downstairs. My fists shook at my sides, the fiery heat of wrath working through me. “Fuck!” I roared, kicking a chair hard enough to send it sailing across the room.

Air hissed through my teeth, as my mind reeled for what to do. I could hear Luna crying in the other room, but my instincts to comfort her were overwhelmed by every other horrible sensation boring into me.

Ben and Wes appeared around me and I turned to them, whatever resided in my eyes giving my uncle pause. “What do we do?” I demanded.

Ben sighed, rubbing his jaw. “The only way to dispel the curse is to destroy its effigy.”

“And where’s that?”

He hesitated, looking to my uncle who shook his head. “Most likely in the shapeshifter’s lair” he answered anyway.

I thought for a moment, letting resignation wash over me and cool my simmering bloodstream. “Alright then” I murmured as I turned to the guns on the counter.

“Nephew” my uncle called as I began loading shells into a shotgun. “Think this through. He’s trying to lure you out of safety. You’ll be walking straight into an ambush. This is what he wants you to do.”

“Well, I’d hate to disappoint” I replied, racking the shotgun and packing a couple handfuls of shells into my pockets.

“Kid, you’re going to get killed” Wes exclaimed when I began marching towards the front door.

I turned on a heel suddenly, almost causing him to walk into me. “Then tell me there’s another way. Tell me how else to save her.” My voice broke, my eyes growing misty with my pleas.

Wes’ words died on his lips, his eyes falling to the ground. I moved my stare to Ben who just shrugged.

“Yeah” I breathed, moving to turn back to the door, but catching sight of Luna crying in the living room made me pause. I looked back to my uncle. “I need you to promise me, if I don’t come back, you’ll get Luna out of here.”

“Kid…”

“Fucking promise me, Wes!” I yelled, grabbing his shirt to force him to look me in the eye.

He hesitated, but eventually nodded. “I promise. I’ll get her out of here, no matter what.”

I pulled in a breath to steady myself, the weight of the stone resting in my gullet adding to the pressure in my chest. I exhaled before turning to the door again.

“Aage” Wes called out as my hand gripped the handle. “Your mother would be proud.”

I chewed on the statement down to the bone before finally replying. “No, she wouldn’t.”

Cold wind lashed around me as distant yips sounded. My eyes scanned the horizon as I stepped down from the porch, catching sight of several coyotes ducking behind various foliage.

I closed my eyes and pulled in a lungful breath, the dust kicked up by the breeze bitter in my nostrils. A collection of crows cawed from their perch on the roof of the house, something strangely invigorating about the sound.

Using the clear icy air to keep senses sharp, I began marching towards the shack. I saw more and more flickers of movement out the corner of my eye, hearing the low rumbling growl of a mountain lion somewhere. The preparations of that ambush Wes had predicted. My hands, palms slick with sweat, tightened their grip on the shotgun, my finger stroking the trigger with each buzz of anticipation licking the back of my neck.

I was almost at the edge of the property when I heard the scuff of rushing steps behind me. I spun around only to find it was Ben, a rifle in his arms.

My face pinched as I lowered the gun. “What the hell are you doing?”

“What? You’re the only one who gets to play hero? Fuck you” he replied wryly, releasing the charging handle of his rifle.

I chuckled and together, the two of us crossed the property line and began our trek towards the belly of the beast.

The moment we passed that invisible line, a cacophony of coyote howls exploded around us. A hellish war cry.

Ben shouldered his rifle, his gaze sharp as he scanned our surroundings. A prolonged whistle sounded, washing my shoulders with a terrible chill. The same whistle I’d heard my first night here, when that bastard had walked me out into the desert. He was watching our approach. I could feel it in my bones.

Patting the medicine pouch hanging around my neck to remind myself we were better protected now, I advanced.

A coyote suddenly darted out from behind a brittlebush, but I was quick, raising my weapon and blowing open the animal’s throat, cutting off its howl and sending it sprawling to the dirt. Several pops pierced the ringing in my ears as Ben picked a few off from a distance, the survivors scattering and taking cover behind rocks and cacti.

Another two coyotes charged us. I fired three shots that cut them down, but before I could rack the next shell, I saw movement beside the rock I’d just passed. A mountain lion roared as it pounced at me, catching me by surprise. I cried out as its fangs sank into the forearm I used to protect my neck, the beast’s weight dragging me to the ground making me drop my gun.

The lion ripped its teeth from my flesh, the crimson fangs glinting in the light of the sunrise as it prepared to lunge for my throat again. But a bullet halted its efforts when it tore through its shoulder. The lion stumbled as another shot hit it in the side. A third blew through its hip dropping it to the ground, and Ben stepped over me, bringing a boot down onto the lion’s neck before planting three more shots into its skull to be sure it was dead.

“You alright?” he asked me.

I pushed myself to my knees and watched the rivulets of blood curl around my wrist and drip from my fingertips. I struggled to move my middle and index fingers, but the others were able to sustain a shaky grip. I didn’t answer the question, I just picked up the shotgun, using it to push myself up, and gritted my teeth from the pain of racking my next shell.

Ben loaded another magazine as I shot down the coyotes that were guarding the large shack’s door. As we approached the building, Ben let off a few more shots at the coyotes behind us.

The door of the shack was a cobbled together piece of sheet metal, wedged into an opening with no handle. I used the shotgun to blast away the rusty hinges and bust it down with a well-placed couple of kicks. A foul smell poured from the entry bringing bile to my throat making me grimace and instinctively cover my nose. The stench of rot. The stench of death.

It was almost pitch-black inside the shack, what light the rising sun gifted struggling to make it far inside. But from what I could see, there were two twisting hallways. One directly ahead, seemingly ramping upwards a little, and one straight to the right, with a corner into blackness after about ten feet.

I turned to help hold off the rest of the approaching coyotes, but when I did, those that remained turned and ran, disappearing into the distance.

Ben and I looked at each other, taking a breath to collect ourselves and reload. Looking into the shack again, the familiar whistling emanated from the darkness and somehow, I knew it was the witch’s way of beckoning us inside.

As soon as I stepped in, an icy chill stroked the nape of my neck, like a breath exhaled from the lips of a corpse. My skin prickled and my heart shuddered, the ringing in my ears overwhelming my senses for a few moments before Ben tapped my arm.

Silently, he pointed to himself then to the hallway ahead, then he pointed to me and the hallway to our right. “We need to move fast, call out when you find it.”

“I don’t know what I’m looking for” I replied.

“You’ll know it when you see it.” And he began to advance into the hallway, his gun up and ready.

Hissing a curse, but keeping Riley in the forefront of my mind, I moved. Slowly while my eyes adjusted to the dark, my shoulder and back against the right-side wall, I pushed into the darkness. Beneath the ringing in my ears, I began to hear things. The rattling of claws against metal. Heavy breathing through sharp bared teeth. Manic cackling spewed from a dry raspy throat. Whispers. Murmurings of violence, of violations against me and the people I love. Then it became voices I knew.

“Aage…”

My sister’s quiet murmur sent a shiver through my nervous system, my breath trembling with each slow step I took down that stygian hallway. The blood dripping from my arm left a trail behind me, my thread in this labyrinth.

“You said this was a fresh start.”

“Are we going to die?”

“I want to go home.”

Through the darkness I saw a flash of eyes and a smile, glowing like a cat’s does in headlights. I fired my shotgun, dirt flying up as the buckshot tore apart the wall, each pull of the pump sending agony through my arm. I heard the scuttling feet as the figure ran further into the hallway, laughing.

“I’m scared, Aage” Riley’s voice whimpered in the dark.

Then her screams began to echo, underlined by manic raspy laughter, digging into my mind and making the shadows darker. Each corner I turned, I spotted a flash of movement down the hallway, disappearing around the next bend.

“What’s going to happen to us?”

“I wish we never came here.”

“I don’t want to die.”

Guilt gnawed at the base of my skull, tightening around my throat. I turned another corner and a mass of about a dozen owls suddenly lunged at me. I threw myself backwards, crying out as razor talons slashed across my face almost blinding me. Another set sliced into my chest and my foot slipped. I felt the leather string of the medicine pouch snap as I fell to the ground.

I shot my eyes after the flurry of wings now dashing down the hallway I’d just come from, seeing the pouch swinging around within the flock. I quickly sat up, blood pouring from the gash below my right eye, and aimed, following the tiny baggy as the owls made for the corner. My heart was pounding as I knew if I lost that medicine I was fucked.

Finally, I pulled the trigger, just as the owls reached the corner, seeing a bust of feathers fly as one of the birds fell with a squawk. The rest of them disappeared behind the corner.

My gaze snapped back to the path ahead of me, meeting the predatory eyes of the witch as he crouched down by the next turn. Still naked barring a coyote’s skin on his head and bone charms dangling from his sagging skin. His crooked smile was cheek splittingly wide, his slit pupils piercing through the shadows to stab at my heart.

Immediately I turned my gun on him and fired, but a coyote leapt from around the corner to take the shot for him. As I struggled to rack my next shell, the witch laughed, standing and melting into the darkness again.

A single sob escaped me as I pushed myself up, my vision blurring as I wiped tears and blood from my eyes. I wanted to just lay down, even if it meant death. But I couldn’t. I had to keep going.

I stumbled back up the hallway to the owl I’d shot down, murmuring pleas as I sifted through the feathers, relief flowing from me when I found the little pouch. Blood dripped from my chin from the gashes in my face and soaked into my shirt from my chest as I retied the medicine around my neck, grabbing a few owl feathers just because.

I pushed onward, loading more shotgun shells as I moved.

Then I heard Ben’s voice.

“Y’know this is stupid right?”

“These white folk never stand a fucking chance.”

“Staying here to help them, it’s gonna get us killed too.”

“Hell, at this point, getting killed by the Inquisition might be a mercy.”

The metallic taste of blood coated my tongue, my quivering arms struggling to keep my weapon raised. The rotten fetor of death had fully submerged me, staining me and clouding my mind with fear. The sounds of footsteps echoed around me, joined by the occasional bout of mocking laughter and scrape of a knife on steel.

Wes’ voice then began.

“He was a nice kid back then. He’s so different now.”

“He’s got his father’s anger, that’s for sure.”

“I’m worried about how else he might be like Malcolm.”

I turned another corner and saw light, yellow and flickering like that of a candle. I had to be reaching the end of this maze. That whistle again beamed through the place, stroking my skin with a sickening sensation.

Reaching the next corner, I turned just in time to see the witch’s scrawny figure scurry up the left side wall. I fired a shot, but hit only dirt as he forced his body through a narrow gap in the ceiling, laughing as he disappeared from view.

I then felt something in my chest sink when my father’s voice drifted across my ears.

“You have no power here.”

“You’re weak.”

“You couldn’t save anyone.”

“You can’t do anything.”

“You’ll always be alone. Just like me.”

Hearing his voice again after all these years felt like having my heart carved out of my chest. I staggered, flinching like he was about to strike me, like I was a helpless child again at the mercy of a spiteful man, who couldn’t stop that man from destroying the only woman who cared about me. My breath caught and I couldn’t stop the sob from tearing from my lips.

I pulled my breathing back under control and gritted my teeth as my eyes tracked to the flickering light ahead. I was a helpless kid no longer, and I proved that to myself by racking another shell before pushing forward.

Following the light, the stench of decay reached an all-time high as I finally made it into another room. I jolted when catching what I thought was the outline of a man out the corner of my eye. Turning to aim my weapon, I realized what it truly was.

Skin. Hanging from a bone rack like a coat. White bloody skin, spread out and displayed. A hunter’s trophy.

While empty and deflated, I could still see the shape of his face clear as day. Inside it, symbols had been drawn with ash, some part of the spell that allowed the wearer to become the person they wore. I stumbled away from it, vomit climbing up my gullet. When I saw the dark clothes of a priest lying beside it, I knew who the skin belonged to.

Not wanting to see the ghastly sight any longer, I walked away, stepping into a small room with candles flickering all around. In the center was a circle, not unlike the one found below my house, though instead of ash and tobacco, it was made of gray bones and old brown blood. Along the walls were dozens of pelts, most animal, a couple human, all baring those same ashen symbols.

Approaching the circle, I analyzed the ornament in the middle, made from sticks and animal bones, and hair. Blue hair. It had to be the effigy.

I kicked away some of the bone in the circle before stomping down on the effigy. Crouching, I tore away and snapped the twigs, yanking free every hair I could and tucking them into my pocket.

Once I destroyed every part of it, I stood, hoping beyond hope I’d done it correctly. One last look around, I noticed a collection of jars in a rusty shopping cart in the corner.

The jars held a variety of items. Teeth, bones, trinkets like children’s toys and jewelry, dried ears, tongues, hair. I scanned them all and eventually found one that housed a plastic hairbrush, several long blue hairs still clinging to the bristles.

I grabbed the jar and turned to leave, but a thought hit me. I looked around at the wooden beams holding up the ceiling. I scanned all the twigs and string scattered all around. And I turned to the candles.

Moving quickly, I grabbed up anything and everything that could be flammable. Sticks, string, hair, clothing. Scattering everything and piling things up until I was happy it’d burn well. Then I used one of the candles to light it up. It wasn’t a quick burn, but it was enough to hopefully provide a distraction and aid our getaway.

Finally, I left that infernal room, running back down the winding hallway, smoke following behind and choking my voice as I yelled. “Ben! I got it, let’s go!”

I was expecting to get attacked. For the shadows to suddenly lunge out and grab me. But I made it all the way back to the front door without incident.

Panting, I yelled down the other path. “Ben come on! I got it, let’s get the fuck outta here!”

The silence was louder than any gunshot as I stared into that dark hallway, smoke beginning to cloud the ceiling and clog my throat. My lips parted to call out again, but Ben beat me to it.

“Help!” he cried, followed by some gunshots.

I cursed, taking a step forward as more gunshots rang.

“Aage, Help me! Fuck!” More gunshots, then he started screaming. “Help me! Aage!” His screams grew louder, the witch’s manic laugh joining his cries as I heard a loud crash.

I moved to run but stopped. My eyes trailed down to the jar with Riley’s brush still in my hand. I looked back at the daylight streaming in from the front door. If I died here, he’d still have Riley’s hair and it’d all be for nothing.

I looked back down the hallway, the wet sound of snapping bone preceding Ben’s next bloodcurdling scream. “Aage! Help me! Please! Please fucking help me.” Desperation made his weakening voice hoarse, the witch’s sadistic mocking cries underlining each thumping strike.

My head lowered, shame prickling in my flesh as I murmured “I’m sorry” before leaving out the door.

Ben’s cries followed me as I fled, growing quieter with distance, until I made it to the property line, and he fell painfully quiet, as did the entire world.

No coyotes were nearby. No bugs. No birds. Just the chafing quiet of death. The ringing in my ears. And the witch’s prolonged whistle.

Blood and phlegm coated my throat by the time I got back to the house, the jog taking what was left of my energy. I almost collapsed on the steps, spitting up some vomit as my bloodied dirty limps trembled.

Wes burst through the door, cursing as he crouched down to help me. “Holy shit kid. You did it.”

“I got it” I wheezed, holding up the jar. “I got it all.”

“Yeah, you did” Wes confirmed, taking hold of my arms to help me. “The curse passed a few minutes ago. She’s gonna be okay. You saved her.” Wes then glanced around. “Where’s Ben?”

I looked up, staring past my uncle at Elvis, the look in my eye stealing the air from his lungs. “I’m sorry” I breathed, unable to keep eye contact with him as Elvis staggered, bracing himself on the wall. His eyes grew red and misty as he lowered into the same porch chair I’d sat in while Ben explained to me that he was all Elvis had.

And there Elvis sat, until the sun went down again.

\-

With Ben gone and Elvis grief-stricken, Wes was doing most of the preparations by himself. I could’ve helped, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave Riley’s side. Not that I would be much help anyway with my left arm bandaged, the hand almost useless thanks to the witch’s mountain lion.

Riley hadn’t woken up yet, though Wes told me that was normal. She still looked sickly, dried blood still encrusted on her face, ash still smeared across her body. But the corrupted darkness had left her veins and she was breathing deeply. She was going to be alright.

I’d been sat with her practically the whole time since returning, her head on my lap as I stroked her hair, watching through the window the witch’s shack get slowly engulfed by the flames I’d set on my way out. It’d reduced to just a pile of metal and embers by the time the sky darkened again.

Night eventually fell, and I was idly fiddling with one of the owl feathers I’d picked up, when I heard a scream outside. “Aage!”

My eyes shot to the window, every part of me tensing as if anticipating an impact.

No, it couldn’t be…

“Aage! Help me!”

It was Ben’s voice.

I carefully laid Riley off my lap, grabbing my 1911 and heading downstairs. Stepping out onto the porch, I saw him, standing far off, his dark silhouette blending into the night sky.

“Help me! Please! Please fucking help me” he continued to scream, standing unnervingly still with his arms by his sides, staring directly at me.

I took a step forward but a hand grabbed my arm. I looked back to find Elvis, still sat where he’d fallen when I returned without his son. His eyes were hazy, moonlight shining in the moisture that’d collected in the creases of his cheeks.

His grip was firm as he shook his head, a broken sound escaping his lips as he sucked in a pained breath.

“Help me! Aage! Fuck! Please help me!” the broken imitation of Ben continued.

I looked back to the witch, and though the dark shrouded him completely, I swore I could still see him smiling at me.

I thrusted my gun forward, but before I could pull the trigger, he ducked down and scuttled away on all fours.

“Aage! Please! Help me! Help me, Aage!” it continued as he disappeared into the night. Repeating Ben’s final words, the voice sounding from all around us but never relenting, never stopping for a moment for the entire rest of the night.

As I laid beside Riley later, for hours, it went on with the unanswered pleas.

“Aage! Please! Please fucking help me.”

And I was sure I would forever hear them in my nightmares.

1oqwylp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LiveMates-AE/comments/1oqwylp/how_to_avoid_scams_when_looking_for_a_roommate/,How to Avoid Scams When Looking for a Roommate Online,"Finding a roommate online sounds easy enough — scroll through a few listings, chat a bit, and move in. But for many expats and newcomers in Dubai, it can turn into a headache if you’re not careful. Scams around rental listings and roommate searches are more common than most people realize, and they’re often subtle enough to trick even cautious people.

At LiveMates, we’ve seen hundreds of stories from users trying to find flatmates or shared housing in Dubai. Some ended up with great matches, others lost deposits or got ghosted right before moving in. So here’s what we’ve learned from their experiences — the red flags, the quiet warning signs, and the small things that make a big difference.

# 1. Be skeptical of “too good to be true” listings

You’ve seen them — large private rooms in prime locations for half the usual rent, or ads that look overly polished. Most scams start this way. The scammer lists a property at an unusually low rate to attract quick interest. Once you reach out, they’ll often say they’re “currently abroad” or “can’t meet in person,” but will happily offer to reserve the room if you pay a deposit upfront.

One LiveMates user shared that she transferred 2,000 AED for a “deposit” on a villa room in Jumeirah. The ad disappeared the next day, and the phone number was no longer active. Unfortunately, this story isn’t rare.

The easiest rule? Never send money before you see the room in person. If the person pressures you to “secure it fast,” that’s your sign to walk away. Real landlords or roommates understand that people need to visit before committing.

# 2. Always verify who you’re talking to

Scammers can make fake profiles look real — profile photos, social media links, even local phone numbers. Don’t rely only on appearances. Ask for a quick video call before meeting or transferring anything. Real people will rarely refuse a 5-minute chat.

Some users we spoke to mentioned that during calls, they quickly noticed odd details — accents that didn’t match their claimed background, vague answers about the area, or reluctance to show the property on video. That’s when they realized something was off.

If you’re dealing directly with a landlord or an agent, ask for Ejari, tenancy contract, or proof of ownership. In Dubai, these documents are standard and can confirm whether the listing is legitimate.

# 3. Meet in a safe, public place first

If you’re meeting a potential roommate for the first time, treat it like a job interview — in a coffee shop, not in someone’s apartment. It’s just basic safety. Some people prefer to bring a friend along the first time or share their location for extra security.

Our team noticed that people who take a few extra minutes to meet in public tend to avoid the more awkward or risky situations later — like discovering that their “roommate” has a completely different lifestyle or expectations. The first meeting tells you a lot.

# 4. Beware of “agent” intermediaries asking for fees

A common scam pattern in Dubai involves fake “agents” or “property coordinators.” They claim to represent the landlord but request a “service fee” before viewing the property. In almost every case we’ve seen, that fee disappears along with the so-called agent.

If someone says they can’t show the place until you pay a fee, that’s your cue to stop the conversation. Real estate agents in Dubai are licensed — you can verify their RERA number online through the Dubai Land Department.

# 5. Trust your gut — and ask for references

This might sound simple, but your instincts are often right. If a conversation feels rushed or inconsistent, slow down. Ask follow-up questions: Who else lives there? How long has the lease been active? Are utilities included? Scammers usually struggle to keep details straight.

One of our LiveMates users told us she nearly moved into an apartment after just one WhatsApp chat. But when she asked for the contract, the person suddenly became defensive. That small moment saved her a lot of trouble.

If you’re joining an existing household, ask to speak with at least one current tenant. A quick chat with them can confirm whether the place and people actually exist.

# 6. Keep your personal data private

This one’s easy to forget. Avoid sharing your Emirates ID, passport copy, or salary details before signing an actual lease. Scammers sometimes use these details to create fake rental contracts or even open accounts in your name. If someone insists on ID “just for verification,” wait until you’re dealing with a verified landlord or agency.

# A few closing thoughts

Finding a roommate in Dubai can be stressful — between inflated rents, countless listings, and the pressure to move fast, people sometimes let their guard down. But if you slow things down a little, verify who you’re talking to, and follow basic safety checks, you’ll avoid 99% of the traps out there.

At LiveMates, we’ve learned that the safest connections come from transparency and patience. Real people will respect your caution, and genuine listings can handle a few extra questions.

My stare remained fixed to the ceiling, the rigidity of my body leaving the bed beneath me feeling like stone. One hand rested on Riley’s waist, the other stroked Luna’s scalp as they both slept against me. The sinister serenade of the coyotes earlier had awoken them, and they were now holding me much tighter so I couldn’t escape again.

As my fingers brushed through the dark brown and blue hairs on my sister’s head, the poor girl gently quivering beneath my palm, all I could think about was the words the witch had uttered.

*“Cut out your sister’s heart, drink her blood and her tears.”*

*“Do what your father could not.”*

I reached into the murky depths of my memory trying to recall if my father had ever reached out while we were in Seattle. If anyone had dropped some kind of hint or suggestion of us reconnecting. But nothing stood out.

There was one thing that came to me, something much more recent than I was looking for. From just a few days ago. When I had introduced myself and the girls to the neighbor. When I mentioned my father, he’d seemed surprised. Like he didn’t know Malcolm had a second son. Like he didn’t know he had a daughter.

My father never mentioned us to him. Why? If he was trying to become like him?

The uncomfortable thoughts and theories circling through my head made my skin crawl. Eventually I became too restless and, not wanting to wake the girls with my fidgeting, unfurled their arms from around me. But as I tried to wriggle out of bed, Riley’s hand gripped my wrist, her pleading eyes watery with worry. Luna shifted, gently mewling as she curled into a tighter ball while Riley and I had a silent conversation.

I leaned over, gently placing a kiss on her temple, the warmth of her soft skin quelling that roiling ocean within me. “I’ll be back in a minute. I promise” I whispered, squeezing her forearm.

She let out an anxious breath, her brows dipping as she released me, cuddling close to Luna as she watched me leave the room. I reached the top of the stairs and began to hear hushed conversation from the lower floor.

I took a few steps down trying to listen in when Wes’ voice roared. “No!” The fury within the outburst made me flinch. There were a few beats of silence until their talking continued.

“Just think it through, Wes” Ben’s voice half whispered. “You heard the way it was talking. He’s old. Possibly centuries. We don’t have the manpower or the medicine to take that on by ourselves.”

My uncle growled loudly, his pacing steps hard enough to shake the wall beside me. “This is *our* land. *Our* people. *Our* problem to handle.”

“He killed a fucking priest!” Ben exclaimed.

Wes scoffed. “Lawence? There’s no way that drunk was part of the Inquisition.”

“It doesn’t matter” Ben hissed. “He was a priest. They will investigate his death. And when they find out we knew and didn’t report it, we’re all fucked. Their trust is much easier to lose than it is to gain. You really wanna give them an excuse to raise their presence here? How’s that gonna be for *our people*?”

A span of tense but pensive silence passed. “And what happens when they decide Aage and Luna are exposure risks.”

“They won’t.”

“They might.”

Again, a long silence elapsed. “I can’t risk my niece and nephew, Ben” Wes breathed. “I owe it to Elinor to get them out of this.”

Ben let out a frustrated murmur. “Fine.” I heard him drop onto the couch. “But we can’t fight this thing ourselves. So, how about this. We put together enough protections to we get us out of here. Cut and run. Then I’ll make a call to my Inquisition contact. Let them handle the dirty business. And I’ll leave their names out of it.”

“It’s over an hour’s drive no matter where we go” Wes replied. “With six people, I don’t know if we have enough of anything.”

Ben spat a curse. “Alright, let’s just take some time. Come up with a plan. For tonight, I’ll take first watch. You two get some rest.”

\-

A deep orange was just beginning to line the horizon when I came downstairs again. My eyelids felt heavy, my bones felt hollow, my flesh felt deflated. My whole soul was tired. With everything that’d happened in such a short time, I was drained of energy, of spirit… of hope. I just felt empty.

I dragged my feet past Ben and Elvis, the old man lying on the ground asleep on a mat while his son messed with the guns and bullets on the countertops, murmuring a song too quiet for me to parse. I paid them no mind and Ben returned that effort.

My uncle was slumped on the couch in the living room, his eyes thoughtfully staring into nothingness. He’d taken his jacket off, leaving his forearms exposed with his t-shirt. On his left bicep was a colorful tattoo of a tremendous bird with lighting exploding around it, the Thunderbird. The sight of it brought a slew of happy memories from my time with him when I was a kid.

His gaze snapped to me once I got close and he wiped the despondency from his features before attempting a smile.

“What’s he doing now?” I asked, tipping my head towards Ben.

Wes took off his Stetson and placed it on the coffee table. “Using the sacred ash to bless our weapons and bullets. So they can pass through whatever protections the witch has.”

I didn’t really have anything to add to that, so I just shrugged and dropped onto the couch beside him.

“Get any sleep?” he asked.

“Nope” I sighed, my head lolling back against the couch. “But I haven’t been sleeping much anyway, even before all this spooky shit. There’s no rest to be had in this house.”

Wes seemed to ponder that, a blanket of silence washing over us until he spoke again. “Y’know I…” He bit his tongue, seeming to reconsider his wording. “I’ve always wanted to apologize to you for, y’know, not doing anything. Back then.”

I shrugged, my gaze lingering on the hole in the wall that led to the protective spell below us. “What could you have done? It’s not like mom ever had the guts to leave his ass. She didn’t want to be saved.” Wes let out a noncommittal sound. I rolled my head over to look at him, my brows furrowing with thought. “There is one thing though.” He looked at me. “Why did you stop visiting? Going to the Rez with you was some of the best days of my childhood. So, why did it stop?”

Grief hijacked his facial features as he sank further into the couch. “Your mother never told you?” I shook my head. “I guess you were too young to understand. Your mother told me to stop coming by.”

My frown deepened. “Why?”

He sighed through his broad nostrils. “I fell into the drink. Like our father did. It had something to do with being unable to protect her and… a few other things. I couldn’t get out of that particular monster’s hold.” He sniffed and dragged a hand over his face as he sat up, idly reaching for his hat to fiddle with. “The last time I saw you. I’d just lost my job. Been drinking all night. I forgot I was supposed to pick you boys up so, I was still drunk when I got here.”

“Shit. I remember that” I mused. “Yeah, I remember you acting funny, and driving bad. I thought it was just you playing a weird joke or something.”

Wes pumped his brows, his lips pressing together as he gently shook his head. “You were young enough to still think all adults knew best. Oscar, I think, saw right through it. Must’ve been him who told your mother.” He let out a dry mournful chuckle. “She let me have it. Away from you two of course. But you should’ve seen her, I’d never seen fury like that before, or since. And your mother was a sweet woman, but she knew how to cut deep. Said I was acting like our father. He was a drunk too. Had half a dozen kids with just as many women. I was becoming him.” His voice broke, forcing him to clear his throat and swallow. “She told me to not come by anymore, that I was no good to be around you boys. She was right, so I listened. Figured it was for the best. But… now. I wonder if maybe, if I had had the strength to pull myself together, if maybe I’d been able to do something. Maybe they’d both still be alive.” A wetness lined his eyes, his voice straining as he held in the anguish bubbling up in his chest. “I’m sorry, kid.”

I watched him for a few moments before shrugging. “The past is the past. Can’t change it. Ain’t no point in dwelling on it” I muttered.

Wes scoffed. “Hypocrite.”

The two of us shared a chuckle that seemed to loosen some of the tension that’d been gnawing through my torso. Then Riley’s screams ripped through the house.

Adrenaline flooded my veins as I shot off the couch and flew up the stairs. I didn’t pause for a moment to even check that the others were following, I just beelined for our bedroom.

Bursting into the room, pulse throbbing in my temples, I found Riley on our bed, thrashing around like she was on fire, screaming so hard I could see the cords of muscle in her throat bulging. I hopped up onto the mattress beside her, gripping her shoulders in a vain attempt to restrain her, her legs kicking out, her hands clawing at herself leaving red stripes across her pale skin.

“Riley, wake up” I called desperately, unable to even hear myself, her lips painted crimson as her screaming brought up drops of blood. Her muscles were tensing so hard I worried her bones would break beneath the pressure. I looked back at Wes behind me. “What’s happening?” I barked. “Is it a dream? You said the catchers would prevent this!”

A sickening sensation rolled through my gut when I saw the color drain from my uncle’s face. “That’s no dream.”

Ben and Elvis appeared in the doorway and Wes immediately barked orders for them to retrieve things.

In my panic I hadn’t thought of my sister, only remembering her presence when my gaze found her in the corner of the room, her hands over her ears, her face coated with tears.

“Take her out of here” I commanded. Wes didn’t argue, quickly picking Luna up and carrying her out, murmuring into her ear about how things were going to be okay, unable to channel any truth into his tone.

Blood was seeping from the edges of Riley’s eyes when Ben and Elvis finally returned, Elvis with his drum and Ben with the ceremonial ashes. “Hold her still” Ben ordered as Elvis lit up a bundle of sage and sweetgrass, waving the smudge stick over Riley to bathe her in the earthy smelling smoke. I did as I was instructed and Ben began smearing the ash across Riley’s body. Her belly, her arms, her neck, her face, her legs, every part of her was donned with a dark gray hand smear. Elvis in the meanwhile began beating his drum, and singing a song similar to the one he’d bellowed when cleansing my soul of the corpse powder.

It took a few minutes, though it felt like lifetimes, but Riley’s screaming eventually began to ease. Her eyelids fluttered, her muscles finally loosened, and she fell into a deep sleep, scarlet droplets spilling down the side of her face from her eyes, mouth and nostrils.

Now that she was still, I truly took her in. She’d become deathly pale, corpselike. The veins beneath her paper skin had turned a deep sickly purple, growing darker on her temples. As she shivered, I realized how cold she felt, flesh of ice. Her breaths were shallow as they secreted from her bloodied lips.

“What is this?” The question came out of me as a choked sob. Ben tried to grab my arm and gently pull me back but I yanked myself from his grip. “Get the fuck off me” I yelled, not taking my eyes off the woman I loved.

“You need to let her rest” he said quietly, Elvis’ chants quieting into a steady hum.

Tears beaded on my lashes as I lifted a hand to her face, gently stroking her cheek with my thumb. “What the fuck is this?”

Ben sighed through his nostrils. “She’s been cursed.”

I looked back at him. “Then heal her. Like you did with me.”

“It’s not that simple” he replied.

“Why the fuck not?” I snarled as I stood, taking a stride towards him.

He stepped back, raising a finger to me as his eyes took on a note of warning. “This is different. The witch must have some part of her. Hair, nail clippings, something that he has attached the curse to. All we can do is soothe her, slow it down. But we can’t cure it here.”

My lips moved wordlessly for a spell, my mind racing as I digested what he was telling me. “How did… how could he have…” Something evil slithered down my spine as I put things together. “Her hairbrush… She lost her hairbrush. He must’ve…”

My chest tightened to an agonizing degree, strangling me until I had to gasp for air, bracing on the dresser.

Ben was by my side again. “My father’s ceremony will halt the curse’s effects for a while. But she needs to rest.”

I pulled back the emotions threatening to cleave me in two and nodded, leaving the room to return to the kitchen downstairs. My fists shook at my sides, the fiery heat of wrath working through me. “Fuck!” I roared, kicking a chair hard enough to send it sailing across the room.

Air hissed through my teeth, as my mind reeled for what to do. I could hear Luna crying in the other room, but my instincts to comfort her were overwhelmed by every other horrible sensation boring into me.

Ben and Wes appeared around me and I turned to them, whatever resided in my eyes giving my uncle pause. “What do we do?” I demanded.

Ben sighed, rubbing his jaw. “The only way to dispel the curse is to destroy its effigy.”

“And where’s that?”

He hesitated, looking to my uncle who shook his head. “Most likely in the shapeshifter’s lair” he answered anyway.

I thought for a moment, letting resignation wash over me and cool my simmering bloodstream. “Alright then” I murmured as I turned to the guns on the counter.

“Nephew” my uncle called as I began loading shells into a shotgun. “Think this through. He’s trying to lure you out of safety. You’ll be walking straight into an ambush. This is what he wants you to do.”

“Well, I’d hate to disappoint” I replied, racking the shotgun and packing a couple handfuls of shells into my pockets.

“Kid, you’re going to get killed” Wes exclaimed when I began marching towards the front door.

I turned on a heel suddenly, almost causing him to walk into me. “Then tell me there’s another way. Tell me how else to save her.” My voice broke, my eyes growing misty with my pleas.

Wes’ words died on his lips, his eyes falling to the ground. I moved my stare to Ben who just shrugged.

“Yeah” I breathed, moving to turn back to the door, but catching sight of Luna crying in the living room made me pause. I looked back to my uncle. “I need you to promise me, if I don’t come back, you’ll get Luna out of here.”

“Kid…”

“Fucking promise me, Wes!” I yelled, grabbing his shirt to force him to look me in the eye.

He hesitated, but eventually nodded. “I promise. I’ll get her out of here, no matter what.”

I pulled in a breath to steady myself, the weight of the stone resting in my gullet adding to the pressure in my chest. I exhaled before turning to the door again.

“Aage” Wes called out as my hand gripped the handle. “Your mother would be proud.”

I chewed on the statement down to the bone before finally replying. “No, she wouldn’t.”

Cold wind lashed around me as distant yips sounded. My eyes scanned the horizon as I stepped down from the porch, catching sight of several coyotes ducking behind various foliage.

I closed my eyes and pulled in a lungful breath, the dust kicked up by the breeze bitter in my nostrils. A collection of crows cawed from their perch on the roof of the house, something strangely invigorating about the sound.

Using the clear icy air to keep senses sharp, I began marching towards the shack. I saw more and more flickers of movement out the corner of my eye, hearing the low rumbling growl of a mountain lion somewhere. The preparations of that ambush Wes had predicted. My hands, palms slick with sweat, tightened their grip on the shotgun, my finger stroking the trigger with each buzz of anticipation licking the back of my neck.

I was almost at the edge of the property when I heard the scuff of rushing steps behind me. I spun around only to find it was Ben, a rifle in his arms.

My face pinched as I lowered the gun. “What the hell are you doing?”

“What? You’re the only one who gets to play hero? Fuck you” he replied wryly, releasing the charging handle of his rifle.

I chuckled and together, the two of us crossed the property line and began our trek towards the belly of the beast.

The moment we passed that invisible line, a cacophony of coyote howls exploded around us. A hellish war cry.

Ben shouldered his rifle, his gaze sharp as he scanned our surroundings. A prolonged whistle sounded, washing my shoulders with a terrible chill. The same whistle I’d heard my first night here, when that bastard had walked me out into the desert. He was watching our approach. I could feel it in my bones.

Patting the medicine pouch hanging around my neck to remind myself we were better protected now, I advanced.

A coyote suddenly darted out from behind a brittlebush, but I was quick, raising my weapon and blowing open the animal’s throat, cutting off its howl and sending it sprawling to the dirt. Several pops pierced the ringing in my ears as Ben picked a few off from a distance, the survivors scattering and taking cover behind rocks and cacti.

Another two coyotes charged us. I fired three shots that cut them down, but before I could rack the next shell, I saw movement beside the rock I’d just passed. A mountain lion roared as it pounced at me, catching me by surprise. I cried out as its fangs sank into the forearm I used to protect my neck, the beast’s weight dragging me to the ground making me drop my gun.

The lion ripped its teeth from my flesh, the crimson fangs glinting in the light of the sunrise as it prepared to lunge for my throat again. But a bullet halted its efforts when it tore through its shoulder. The lion stumbled as another shot hit it in the side. A third blew through its hip dropping it to the ground, and Ben stepped over me, bringing a boot down onto the lion’s neck before planting three more shots into its skull to be sure it was dead.

“You alright?” he asked me.

I pushed myself to my knees and watched the rivulets of blood curl around my wrist and drip from my fingertips. I struggled to move my middle and index fingers, but the others were able to sustain a shaky grip. I didn’t answer the question, I just picked up the shotgun, using it to push myself up, and gritted my teeth from the pain of racking my next shell.

Ben loaded another magazine as I shot down the coyotes that were guarding the large shack’s door. As we approached the building, Ben let off a few more shots at the coyotes behind us.

The door of the shack was a cobbled together piece of sheet metal, wedged into an opening with no handle. I used the shotgun to blast away the rusty hinges and bust it down with a well-placed couple of kicks. A foul smell poured from the entry bringing bile to my throat making me grimace and instinctively cover my nose. The stench of rot. The stench of death.

It was almost pitch-black inside the shack, what light the rising sun gifted struggling to make it far inside. But from what I could see, there were two twisting hallways. One directly ahead, seemingly ramping upwards a little, and one straight to the right, with a corner into blackness after about ten feet.

I turned to help hold off the rest of the approaching coyotes, but when I did, those that remained turned and ran, disappearing into the distance.

Ben and I looked at each other, taking a breath to collect ourselves and reload. Looking into the shack again, the familiar whistling emanated from the darkness and somehow, I knew it was the witch’s way of beckoning us inside.

As soon as I stepped in, an icy chill stroked the nape of my neck, like a breath exhaled from the lips of a corpse. My skin prickled and my heart shuddered, the ringing in my ears overwhelming my senses for a few moments before Ben tapped my arm.

Silently, he pointed to himself then to the hallway ahead, then he pointed to me and the hallway to our right. “We need to move fast, call out when you find it.”

“I don’t know what I’m looking for” I replied.

“You’ll know it when you see it.” And he began to advance into the hallway, his gun up and ready.

Hissing a curse, but keeping Riley in the forefront of my mind, I moved. Slowly while my eyes adjusted to the dark, my shoulder and back against the right-side wall, I pushed into the darkness. Beneath the ringing in my ears, I began to hear things. The rattling of claws against metal. Heavy breathing through sharp bared teeth. Manic cackling spewed from a dry raspy throat. Whispers. Murmurings of violence, of violations against me and the people I love. Then it became voices I knew.

“Aage…”

My sister’s quiet murmur sent a shiver through my nervous system, my breath trembling with each slow step I took down that stygian hallway. The blood dripping from my arm left a trail behind me, my thread in this labyrinth.

“You said this was a fresh start.”

“Are we going to die?”

“I want to go home.”

Through the darkness I saw a flash of eyes and a smile, glowing like a cat’s does in headlights. I fired my shotgun, dirt flying up as the buckshot tore apart the wall, each pull of the pump sending agony through my arm. I heard the scuttling feet as the figure ran further into the hallway, laughing.

“I’m scared, Aage” Riley’s voice whimpered in the dark.

Then her screams began to echo, underlined by manic raspy laughter, digging into my mind and making the shadows darker. Each corner I turned, I spotted a flash of movement down the hallway, disappearing around the next bend.

“What’s going to happen to us?”

“I wish we never came here.”

“I don’t want to die.”

Guilt gnawed at the base of my skull, tightening around my throat. I turned another corner and a mass of about a dozen owls suddenly lunged at me. I threw myself backwards, crying out as razor talons slashed across my face almost blinding me. Another set sliced into my chest and my foot slipped. I felt the leather string of the medicine pouch snap as I fell to the ground.

I shot my eyes after the flurry of wings now dashing down the hallway I’d just come from, seeing the pouch swinging around within the flock. I quickly sat up, blood pouring from the gash below my right eye, and aimed, following the tiny baggy as the owls made for the corner. My heart was pounding as I knew if I lost that medicine I was fucked.

Finally, I pulled the trigger, just as the owls reached the corner, seeing a bust of feathers fly as one of the birds fell with a squawk. The rest of them disappeared behind the corner.

My gaze snapped back to the path ahead of me, meeting the predatory eyes of the witch as he crouched down by the next turn. Still naked barring a coyote’s skin on his head and bone charms dangling from his sagging skin. His crooked smile was cheek splittingly wide, his slit pupils piercing through the shadows to stab at my heart.

Immediately I turned my gun on him and fired, but a coyote leapt from around the corner to take the shot for him. As I struggled to rack my next shell, the witch laughed, standing and melting into the darkness again.

A single sob escaped me as I pushed myself up, my vision blurring as I wiped tears and blood from my eyes. I wanted to just lay down, even if it meant death. But I couldn’t. I had to keep going.

I stumbled back up the hallway to the owl I’d shot down, murmuring pleas as I sifted through the feathers, relief flowing from me when I found the little pouch. Blood dripped from my chin from the gashes in my face and soaked into my shirt from my chest as I retied the medicine around my neck, grabbing a few owl feathers just because.

I pushed onward, loading more shotgun shells as I moved.

Then I heard Ben’s voice.

“Y’know this is stupid right?”

“These white folk never stand a fucking chance.”

“Staying here to help them, it’s gonna get us killed too.”

“Hell, at this point, getting killed by the Inquisition might be a mercy.”

The metallic taste of blood coated my tongue, my quivering arms struggling to keep my weapon raised. The rotten fetor of death had fully submerged me, staining me and clouding my mind with fear. The sounds of footsteps echoed around me, joined by the occasional bout of mocking laughter and scrape of a knife on steel.

Wes’ voice then began.

“He was a nice kid back then. He’s so different now.”

“He’s got his father’s anger, that’s for sure.”

“I’m worried about how else he might be like Malcolm.”

I turned another corner and saw light, yellow and flickering like that of a candle. I had to be reaching the end of this maze. That whistle again beamed through the place, stroking my skin with a sickening sensation.

Reaching the next corner, I turned just in time to see the witch’s scrawny figure scurry up the left side wall. I fired a shot, but hit only dirt as he forced his body through a narrow gap in the ceiling, laughing as he disappeared from view.

I then felt something in my chest sink when my father’s voice drifted across my ears.

“You have no power here.”

“You’re weak.”

“You couldn’t save anyone.”

“You can’t do anything.”

“You’ll always be alone. Just like me.”

Hearing his voice again after all these years felt like having my heart carved out of my chest. I staggered, flinching like he was about to strike me, like I was a helpless child again at the mercy of a spiteful man, who couldn’t stop that man from destroying the only woman who cared about me. My breath caught and I couldn’t stop the sob from tearing from my lips.

I pulled my breathing back under control and gritted my teeth as my eyes tracked to the flickering light ahead. I was a helpless kid no longer, and I proved that to myself by racking another shell before pushing forward.

Following the light, the stench of decay reached an all-time high as I finally made it into another room. I jolted when catching what I thought was the outline of a man out the corner of my eye. Turning to aim my weapon, I realized what it truly was.

Skin. Hanging from a bone rack like a coat. White bloody skin, spread out and displayed. A hunter’s trophy.

While empty and deflated, I could still see the shape of his face clear as day. Inside it, symbols had been drawn with ash, some part of the spell that allowed the wearer to become the person they wore. I stumbled away from it, vomit climbing up my gullet. When I saw the dark clothes of a priest lying beside it, I knew who the skin belonged to.

Not wanting to see the ghastly sight any longer, I walked away, stepping into a small room with candles flickering all around. In the center was a circle, not unlike the one found below my house, though instead of ash and tobacco, it was made of gray bones and old brown blood. Along the walls were dozens of pelts, most animal, a couple human, all baring those same ashen symbols.

Approaching the circle, I analyzed the ornament in the middle, made from sticks and animal bones, and hair. Blue hair. It had to be the effigy.

I kicked away some of the bone in the circle before stomping down on the effigy. Crouching, I tore away and snapped the twigs, yanking free every hair I could and tucking them into my pocket.

Once I destroyed every part of it, I stood, hoping beyond hope I’d done it correctly. One last look around, I noticed a collection of jars in a rusty shopping cart in the corner.

The jars held a variety of items. Teeth, bones, trinkets like children’s toys and jewelry, dried ears, tongues, hair. I scanned them all and eventually found one that housed a plastic hairbrush, several long blue hairs still clinging to the bristles.

I grabbed the jar and turned to leave, but a thought hit me. I looked around at the wooden beams holding up the ceiling. I scanned all the twigs and string scattered all around. And I turned to the candles.

Moving quickly, I grabbed up anything and everything that could be flammable. Sticks, string, hair, clothing. Scattering everything and piling things up until I was happy it’d burn well. Then I used one of the candles to light it up. It wasn’t a quick burn, but it was enough to hopefully provide a distraction and aid our getaway.

Finally, I left that infernal room, running back down the winding hallway, smoke following behind and choking my voice as I yelled. “Ben! I got it, let’s go!”

I was expecting to get attacked. For the shadows to suddenly lunge out and grab me. But I made it all the way back to the front door without incident.

Panting, I yelled down the other path. “Ben come on! I got it, let’s get the fuck outta here!”

The silence was louder than any gunshot as I stared into that dark hallway, smoke beginning to cloud the ceiling and clog my throat. My lips parted to call out again, but Ben beat me to it.

“Help!” he cried, followed by some gunshots.

I cursed, taking a step forward as more gunshots rang.

“Aage, Help me! Fuck!” More gunshots, then he started screaming. “Help me! Aage!” His screams grew louder, the witch’s manic laugh joining his cries as I heard a loud crash.

I moved to run but stopped. My eyes trailed down to the jar with Riley’s brush still in my hand. I looked back at the daylight streaming in from the front door. If I died here, he’d still have Riley’s hair and it’d all be for nothing.

I looked back down the hallway, the wet sound of snapping bone preceding Ben’s next bloodcurdling scream. “Aage! Help me! Please! Please fucking help me.” Desperation made his weakening voice hoarse, the witch’s sadistic mocking cries underlining each thumping strike.

My head lowered, shame prickling in my flesh as I murmured “I’m sorry” before leaving out the door.

Ben’s cries followed me as I fled, growing quieter with distance, until I made it to the property line, and he fell painfully quiet, as did the entire world.

No coyotes were nearby. No bugs. No birds. Just the chafing quiet of death. The ringing in my ears. And the witch’s prolonged whistle.

Blood and phlegm coated my throat by the time I got back to the house, the jog taking what was left of my energy. I almost collapsed on the steps, spitting up some vomit as my bloodied dirty limps trembled.

Wes burst through the door, cursing as he crouched down to help me. “Holy shit kid. You did it.”

“I got it” I wheezed, holding up the jar. “I got it all.”

“Yeah, you did” Wes confirmed, taking hold of my arms to help me. “The curse passed a few minutes ago. She’s gonna be okay. You saved her.” Wes then glanced around. “Where’s Ben?”

I looked up, staring past my uncle at Elvis, the look in my eye stealing the air from his lungs. “I’m sorry” I breathed, unable to keep eye contact with him as Elvis staggered, bracing himself on the wall. His eyes grew red and misty as he lowered into the same porch chair I’d sat in while Ben explained to me that he was all Elvis had.

And there Elvis sat, until the sun went down again.

\-

With Ben gone and Elvis grief-stricken, Wes was doing most of the preparations by himself. I could’ve helped, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave Riley’s side. Not that I would be much help anyway with my left arm bandaged, the hand almost useless thanks to the witch’s mountain lion.

Riley hadn’t woken up yet, though Wes told me that was normal. She still looked sickly, dried blood still encrusted on her face, ash still smeared across her body. But the corrupted darkness had left her veins and she was breathing deeply. She was going to be alright.

I’d been sat with her practically the whole time since returning, her head on my lap as I stroked her hair, watching through the window the witch’s shack get slowly engulfed by the flames I’d set on my way out. It’d reduced to just a pile of metal and embers by the time the sky darkened again.

Night eventually fell, and I was idly fiddling with one of the owl feathers I’d picked up, when I heard a scream outside. “Aage!”

My eyes shot to the window, every part of me tensing as if anticipating an impact.

No, it couldn’t be…

“Aage! Help me!”

It was Ben’s voice.

I carefully laid Riley off my lap, grabbing my 1911 and heading downstairs. Stepping out onto the porch, I saw him, standing far off, his dark silhouette blending into the night sky.

“Help me! Please! Please fucking help me” he continued to scream, standing unnervingly still with his arms by his sides, staring directly at me.

I took a step forward but a hand grabbed my arm. I looked back to find Elvis, still sat where he’d fallen when I returned without his son. His eyes were hazy, moonlight shining in the moisture that’d collected in the creases of his cheeks.

His grip was firm as he shook his head, a broken sound escaping his lips as he sucked in a pained breath.

“Help me! Aage! Fuck! Please help me!” the broken imitation of Ben continued.

I looked back to the witch, and though the dark shrouded him completely, I swore I could still see him smiling at me.

I thrusted my gun forward, but before I could pull the trigger, he ducked down and scuttled away on all fours.

“Aage! Please! Help me! Help me, Aage!” it continued as he disappeared into the night. Repeating Ben’s final words, the voice sounding from all around us but never relenting, never stopping for a moment for the entire rest of the night.

As I laid beside Riley later, for hours, it went on with the unanswered pleas.

“Aage! Please! Please fucking help me.”

And I was sure I would forever hear them in my nightmares.

I really like the workflow of an E61 group. Warm-up time isn’t an issue thanks to a smart plug. I don’t mind steaming milk with a single-boiler machine, but temperature stability is very important to me.

* **ECM Puristika** – €900 (second-hand from Marktplaats, May 2025, good condition; no steam wand, but we also own a De’Longhi Magnifica Plus which produces very good milk foam suitable for latte art)

[**WIBTA if I declined a wedding invitation after accepting, but didn’t send a present?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sjzpum/wibta_if_i_declined_a_wedding_invitation_after/)

My partner, Martin, took me out to dinner to meet his close friend Andy, and Andy’s fiancée, Anna. I thought we got along well, and Andy said he hoped to see me as a guest at his wedding.

Martin, Andy and Anna all work for the same employer. Martin is part of the employer’s leadership group, but neither Andy nor Anna are in his reporting line.

Also, fake names and timeline of events is compressed.

Martin’s invitation was addressed to him “and guest”. He accepted for both of us.

A week later, he told me about a phone call from Anna. Apparently she’d miscalculated the number of guests they could have at the venue, and would I mind terribly if she cut me from the guest list? Apparently Anna was too embarrassed to ask me herself.

Since we’d only just met, it seemed reasonable I was one of the guests to be cut. I asked Martin to tell them personally that I understood, and pass on my best wishes.

Then Andy called me, and said he hadn’t known about the issue with the venue. But some of his older relatives were declining due to health fears, so he would invite me personally.

My invitation arrived in the mail, with my name on, and I accepted.

That's when things got weird. I bumped into Anna when we were both out shopping. She said we hadn’t seen each other since the dinner, and did I have time for a coffee? I said yes, and after we got our coffees and sat down, Anna said, “Can’t you take a hint?”

I asked what she meant. Anna said wasn’t it obvious she didn’t want me at her wedding? She understood I was unfamiliar with wedding etiquette and how things are done in this country, but the polite thing to do was decline the invitation and send a present.

I told Martin about this, and Martin told me about a similar incident at work. A work friend of Anna’s had confronted him about my “rudeness”. According to the friend, Anna was just inviting me to be polite to the boss’s girlfriend, and I should be just as polite and decline the invitation.

We talked it over, and I am not comfortable going. Martin is going to talk to Andy in person and ask what’s going on, before he decides what to do.

The issue is: should I give them a present? All of the wedding etiquette guides I’ve consulted, say that if you decline a wedding invitation after accepting, you should send a present. But frankly, I feel like I am being used, and giving them both a present feels like I’m saying I’m OK with that.

I’ve asked some of my family members WIBTA, but … let’s just say they’re biased and probably spend too much of their time on r/ProRevenge or r/MaliciousCompliance.

Really, WIBTA if I declined this wedding invitation, but didn’t give the couple a present?

Edit:

Thanks so much for all your replies. I really wasn't expecting this much feedback. When I posted this, I was really confused about what was the right thing to do in this situation, and actually a bit hurt. Still not quite sure what I will do, but now I am starting to see the funny side. And I'm loving some of the suggestions.

# **FAQ POST: Same Day**

[**Update with FAQs and family suggestions**](https://www.reddit.com/user/HokeyPokeyGuestList/comments/sk9hgw/update_with_faqs_and_family_suggestions/)

I'm about to start doing my evening chores, but before I go, I want to answer some of the most frequently asked questions.

**What country is this in?** 

We are in Australia. Of the four of us, I am the only one born and raised in Australia. Anna came here as a child, Andy and Martin as adults.

**Why would I think I should give them a present?** 

My Mum. She was a shining example of being polite and gracious in the face of outrageous behaviour, without condoning it. I guess I want to emulate her. But I just have no idea what the ""polite and gracious"" response is in this situation. Getting some clearer ideas though.

**What is Martin doing?** 

Martin hasn't decided yet. He wants to talk to Andy, and find out how much Andy knows, and how far he is supporting Anna. Then he will decide. He may still go, to support Andy. Or he may not.

**Why is Anna doing this?** 

I have no idea, but I have some guesses. My guess is she wants Martin, but with Martin's and my budget. I think she was hoping I would ""supersize"" the gift, and take it from the ""bog standard model"" to the ""super deluxe shiny model with bells and whistles and hot and cold running water"".

**Why doesn't Anna like you?** 

Again, no idea, but some guesses. I am a different religion to the other three, so she might not like that. My Mum arrived here as a child refugee, so she might be anti-refugee. And Martin and I out-earn Andy and Anna, so she might be jealous.

I didn't get a sense Andy developed a crush on me. We were predisposed to like each other, because we both know how important the other is to Martin. I didn't get a sense Anna disliked me at our meeting. My impression at the time was she might be slow to warm up. But I could be wrong. Probably was.

**What are some of my family's suggestions?**

- **Evil sister: (serious)** - a generous donation to a charity of the groom's choice. That way, I look polite and generous, the bride doesn't benefit, and as other Redditors have pointed out, some good comes of this.

- **Evil sister: (not serious)** - closer to the day, pretend I have symptoms of you know what, and I have to stay home until I get a negative test. On the day of the wedding, post pictures of myself on social media, doing fabulous things not at their wedding, and captioning them ""Celebrating my negative test!""

- **Not quite as evil sister:** Crochet toilet roll cover. Preferably one with a doll in it. Practical, with a retro feel. She has one ripe for re-gifting.

- **Brother:** doubts they will make it to the altar. But has suggested an IOU to the groom for a present at his next wedding.

Now I'm off to brave the hell that is my local supermarket, then treat myself to a nice takeaway for dinner. Now we have to wear masks indoors, I have the perfect excuse not to recognise Anna if I see her!

[**Update - I had it all so, so wrong**](https://www.reddit.com/user/HokeyPokeyGuestList/comments/sqf01j/update_i_had_it_all_so_so_wrong/)

So much has happened in the last - is it really just over a week? It feels much longer.

The nutshell version of what happened in that time is: Andy and Anna did have communication issues; they are working on them and their wedding is still on; Martin and I have split; the wedding is none of my business any more; I hope everyone has a great time and there are no hard feelings.

The fuller version goes like this. Anna was very close to Martin's late wife, and saw her as an older sister figure. Having a virtual stranger at her wedding, in her friend's place, was too much. Andy says Anna knows she acted immaturely, and she is deeply ashamed of some of the things she said to me.

There was a lot more said, which I swore never to repeat. I understand a lot more now, and I regret some of the jokes I made. I've decided to forgive.

Martin and I aren't together anymore. Not directly because of this, but when we considered who Martin was most concerned about (not me) and who I turned to for support (not him), we realised we weren't each others' priority. I had a little cry about it, but I'll be OK.

So as it turns out, my brother was right, in an unexpected way. But he won't be rejoicing at being proved right.

The wedding is none of my business now, and I won't be attending or sending a present. But I hope everyone has a great time.

Thank you to everyone who read my earlier posts, commented, bantered with me, and gave me awards. I was expecting maybe a couple of comments, and hoping someone would explain the etiquette and I would go, “Oh yeah, I see that now”. I got so much more than what I was expecting.

I had no idea how much stress I was carrying in my body over the original problem, until I started laughing and making wisecracks with commenters. Then my tension headache disappeared – the headache I didn’t even know I had. I really think you guys helped cushion me for what was coming.

Life is going on. My youngest got sent home from school because he was sick, so we spent a couple of days vegging on the couch together in our PJ’s, looking completely feral, watching The Brokenwood Mysteries (he loves the one where the murder weapon is an exploding port-a-loo, and one of the suspects tries to escape in a hot air balloon).

If anyone wants a love story (that isn’t Andy and Anna) my sister is revelling in her new role as Evil Sister. She’s thinking of taking up cackling in public. Her partner says he wants to take her name so he can be Evil Brother In Law, and they can cackle away in public together. That’s love.

**By:** Terence Cawley

On Wednesday, November 5, Starbucks Workers United (SBWU) announced the results of their strike authorization vote initiated on October 24.

A supermajority of 92% of SBWU voted to strike dozens of cities on one of the company’s most profitable days of the year, November 13, if Starbucks does not “finalize fair contracts and stop unionbusting.”

Baristas at unionized stores across the United States voted on whether to authorize a strike over the course of several days. The voting process coincided with a wave of seventy practice pickets occurring in sixty cities nationwide (including Worcester, MA; Epping, NH; and Providence, RI) from the 24th through November 1, as the union ramped up efforts to secure a fair first contract for union stores. 

“Workers are done waiting around,” said Starbucks Workers United spokesperson Michelle Eisen. “We’re coming up on close to one year since the last official bargaining session with the company, so it seems like it’s the right time.”

Further strategy for the strike remains in the hands of membership, with ommittees that determine the timeline, duration, and scope of any future actions. “All of our escalation strategies are worker-developed,” said Eisen.

As the strike authorization ramped up, practice pickets offered an opportunity not just for workers to literally practice for a possible strike, as well as to show customers what such a strike would look like while demonstrating to Starbucks workers’ commitment to this fight.

>We’re not bluffing. We’re showing how strong we are and making Starbucks ask: is this really something they want to deal with at their busiest time of the year?

# A Brief History of Starbucks Workers United (SBWU)

Since Starbucks workers in Buffalo, N.Y. started Starbucks Workers United in August 2021, over 650 stores representing over 12,000 workers have unionized. However, none of these stores have reached a collective bargaining agreement.  

Starbucks Workers United’s demands include changes that will enable more baristas to make a living wage, like higher pay, expanded healthcare benefits and paid leave, and more consistent scheduling. The union is also asking for stronger protections from racial and sexual harassment, as well as the enshrinement of current benefits in a contract so they cannot be revoked by the company later. 

Starbucks initially opposed unionization efforts aggressively, leading to over 700 charges of Unfair Labor Practices (ULP) filed against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board. The company reached an agreement with Starbucks Workers United in February 2024 to negotiate a “foundational framework” for contracts for union stores. Starbucks then failed to meet its own deadline to agree to this framework by the end of 2024, leading to workers at over 300 Starbucks location going on strike on Christmas Eve for the largest labor action in company history. 

Starbucks Workers United and the company entered mediation in February 2025. The union has made some progress in contract negotiations, reaching 33 tentative agreements with the company on important issues including just cause, dress codes, and worker health and safety. However, Starbucks continues to hold out on the workers’ three core demands: increasing worker hours to address understaffing and ensure workers qualify for benefits, increasing take-home pay, and resolving all outstanding ULP charges. 

Eisen, who originally organized in Buffalo as part of the initial wave of unionization prior to becoming SBWU’s spokesperson, said: 

>

The most recent offer from Starbucks, which the union rejected in April, offered no raises for union workers in their first year, 1.5 percent raises in subsequent years (“it is actually pennies when you do the math for most workers,” said Eisen), and no solutions for understaffing and the outstanding ULP charges. There was also no indication that the company was willing to move on these points. 

# Worker Dignity Means Customer Dignity

Beyond improving worker quality of life and repairing the damage Starbucks has done to its brand by being “the largest violator of U.S. labor law in modern history,” Eisen argues that the reforms the union is fighting for would also improve the customer experience. When she first started working for Starbucks fifteen years ago, she recalls how adequate staffing allowed stores to maintain higher quality standards for food and drinks. 

Eisen noted:

>

Starbucks Workers United claims on their website that Starbucks could finalize fair union contracts for less than the over $97 million Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol made for four months of work in 2024. Starbucks also covered the cost of Niccol commuting from his home in California to company headquarters in Seattle via private jet. The 2024 wage gap between Niccol and the median Starbucks worker was the largest of the 500 biggest public companies in the U.S., with Niccol making 6,666 times more than the average Starbucks employee.

On September 25, Starbucks announced that they would be closing hundreds of stores nationwide, along with firing 900 corporate workers. Of the 59 union stores included in this round of closures, eight of them were in Massachusetts. Several of those stores, like the Harvard Square and Davis Square locations, had just unionized within the last few months. 

In the weeks following the closures, Starbucks Workers United held practice pickets at stores in 35 cities, including one at the shuttered Harvard Square store and one in New York City which received a supportive visit from mayoral candidate and DSA member Zohran Mamdani. According to Eisen, the closures, rather than weakening the union, have led to a surge in organizing leads as workers are more motivated than ever to win a fair contract.

“It’s another example of the company making decisions with little to no notice and absolutely no input from workers,” said Eisen. “A lot of non-union workers are saying, ‘whoa, we need to get in on this. It’s clear the company doesn’t care about us.’” 

# What Comes Next? 

The strike authorization vote and practice pickets come at a critical time for Starbucks Workers United. The holiday season, typically the busiest and most profitable time of year for Starbucks, is approaching fast. A strike during this season could add to the company’s already significant financial woes.

Starbucks stock is down 6 percent since the beginning of 2025. Same-store sales have declined for six consecutive quarters. 

Meanwhile, public pressure on Starbucks to bargain in good faith with its workers continues to intensify. In September, a coalition of 45 progressive organizations representing over 85 million people, including the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), sent an open letter to Niccol urging him to finalize fair union contracts with SBWU. Starbucks investors have also grown frustrated with the company’s unwillingness to resolve its labor issues, with several groups sending their own [open letters](https://sbworkersunited.org/starbucks-investors-call-on-company-to-restart-negotiations-with-union-baristas/) to the Starbucks Board of Directors over the last few months.  

“Every day, more and more workers are willing to join the fight despite how they’re being treated, which is giving me hope, especially with the current political climate,” said Eisen. “If workers are willing to take on the risk to fight, how can I not fight?”

It fluctuates in intensity (as opposed to intensity and frequency of tinnitus like it has).  This has largely stuck, though aside from prednisone (which does help it a lot) I seem to notice it improves quite a lot after eating , and particular eating a lot of pasta or other carbs. Same thing when coupled especially with 1-3 cups of coffee. I’ve also noticed it is made way worse when I notice I snore when sleeping.. aside from that I’ve been unable to pinpoint the exact reasons why it gets worse or how this phase started at all. 
Also, I train BJJ and the cardio from that seems to also always help for a few hours or so with those symptoms. ",1,1762527762.0,Menieres,0,1.0,False
1oqwpmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1oqwpmr/being_34yo_and_having_migraines_since_im_around/,"Being 34yo and having migraines since I'm around 17-18, some retrospective","Hello, for context I started to have migraines around 16-18 years. At first they were mostly ""big headaches"" that I would have once per week, but around 25yo it started to become twice a week and with the full package (throwing up, aura, shivering...).

Fortunately, those past few years I was able to control more and more my symptoms and nowadays I have around 4-5 crisis per year. My best period was no crisis for a full year, but then I started playing with limits again.

Nowadays I kinda accept playing with the limits to see to where I can go before a crisis happen, but with experience I kinda feel the ""buildup"" occurring for the days before it happens.

One critical element I understood with time is that the risk of a migraine is like a spectrum. When you trigger a crisis, you might had at 90% of that spectrum. But to come back to a state where you will be fine, you might have to grind your way back to 10 or 20% of that spectrum. For example, you might do everything perfect after a crisis but get another ones for the next few 1-2 weeks until your overall state becomes better.

Also, nowadays I kinda have the feeling of that ""buildup"", like some kind of ""brain waste buildup"" that suddenly become a full blown crisis. It's very subtle things like starting to have random tinnitus, having some stiff neck, being a bit more dizzy than usual ... All those things are really important to listen to, since they are the first signs of some kind of ""buildup"".

But to explain what I implements nowadays to reduce my risk of crisis :

* By far the most important thing is sleep hygiene.
   * Regular Timing : Whether I work or not, I don't change my wake up time more than 30min.
   * Regular Duration : Anything between 7:30 to 9:00 of sleep is fine, but going lower or higher is asking from trouble. Those issues won't appear on one day, just like they won't be fixed on one day, it takes in general \~5 days to feel the degradation or the improvement
   * Somewhat related, relaxation like 10-12min nap during the day can help a lot to relieve some buildup.
* Food Wise :
   * If I eat food with low amount of water in it, like dried meat, cheese ... I have to be cautious about my water intake afterward.
   * Alcohol daily is OK but in very very very modest amount. Something like 1, 330ml 5% beer or \~50ml of a 12% alcohol.  Super cautious about water intake afterward.
   * Caffeine : Caffeine is fine, but for whatever reason Coffee not that much. When mixed in Latte it's OK, but I digest coffee very badly and if I drink coffee too many days in a row I start to have mini-crisis during the night. For whatever reason, Tea and Energy Drink are OK but they cause others issues on their own so I try to limit those things to 1 per day.
* Screens :
   * Brightness : I never use anymore my phone in a dark room. Even at lowest setting, something like 30min can start to feel some kind headache to build up.
   * Distance : Funny enough, looking at my laptop at arms length seems worst than looking at it when it's on my desktop and thus at \~2x my arms length (keyboard being detached). I can't look at my phone more than 10-15min without feeling some buildup happening.
   * I work as a software engineer so I take a lot of mini breaks during my day to be sure I don't ""tunnel vision"" on my screen for too long.
* Medication :
   * Ibuprofen/Paracetamol : It's OK to mask the headache/buildup leading to a potential migraine, but that won't avoid the migrane.
* Stress/Nervosity :
   * Single task : Multitasking increase a lot any chance of crisis. Putting for example a vlog on one screen and reading on another is really difficult.
   * Anger : One or two frustration spike is OK, but it's also something to manage.
   * Stress : Same as Anger. If it's just a bit of stress one day, it's OK. But if I stress, get angry and also multitask, it can happens quickly.
* Seasons/Weather/Outside :
   * I just accepted that most of my crisis will happen during Fall/Spring. During summer the sun goes down at around 9-10PM and in winter around 4-5PM here, and Fall/Spring and that daylight fluctuation is a nightmare.
   * I try to plan my daily walk with my dog to not have the sun in my eyes.
   * I wear sunglasses almost always, even when it's cloudy. It helps a lot. When I drive at night, at minimum I point yellow glasses but sometimes I even put normal sunglasses if I'm on a highroad with a lot of lights everywhere.
* Medications :
   * Triptan for Crisis but to be honest it's not like it makes those crisis ""nothing"". I still get most of the symptoms anyways.
   * I took beta blocker (Propranolol) for a few years to reduce blood pressure and thus helping with less crisis. It worked quite well, but in the end I nowadays feel I can control my crisis without it. Also with time I had to increase dosage so I'm not sure how useful it can be if you don't have high blood pressure in the first place.",3,1762527762.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

(i know, i know. i know this is part of the root of the problem, but please be more understanding. i'm not capable of moving out yet.) 

today i just got back home from an entire week abroad for some work thing, but even before i even stepped inside the house i already felt some foreboding that shit was about to hit the fan yet again. so – as not to ruin the good mood i've accumulated in the past week i've been away from my mom – i tried my absolute best to be positive, keep the mood light, made jokes. i even showed her the souvenirs i bought for her, and she was absolutely happy. i even ran her errands. i thought everything was ok. 

the moment i started to relax, she ambushed me in the kitchen with a question about the wedding gift i got for my younger brother. it was a coffee cart for their reception. it was a bit pricey, but worth it, because we love that shop's coffee and because i didn't want to gamble with other brands we don't really know. i paid for it myself. but of course she starts berating me (mind you, it has only been 3 hours since i got home) for being stupid, for being a moron. she then started yelling about how this only proved she was the most knowledgeable and street-smart among all of us and that she doesn't understand how we survived this world while being this stupid. she asked whether i've already paid for the coffee cart, and i said yes; her ranting and yelling got even louder and more insistent. she literally did not even stop to breathe.

i didn't talk back, but i did slam my bedroom door hard on my way back. i couldn't help the juvenile reaction and i should have known better. and THAT'S when she starts screaming her favorite monologue: that she doesn't have anything to look forward to in life anymore, and that she regrets waking up every day and wants to die. outsiders who might hear this might think she's suicidal and needs help (she does need help). but i have heard this monologue a billion times before, for over 10 years. it's her go-to speech when she wants to gaslight us, when she wants to manipulate us, or when she thinks she's lost the upper hand and needed to force a win. 

usually i ignore this. but tonight something in me snapped. she kept going on and on in a pitch that was grating my ears and – for the first time in all the years i've endured this –  i suddenly had an intrusive thought about slapping her in the face to shut her up. 

of course i didn't. but i started banging my head against the bed frame to channel the suddenly violent energy that possessed me. i started screaming in my bedroom and asking god why he was punishing me for being born to my parents. i screamed for him to take me away and end my life because i can't live with her anymore. that i'm not suicidal, but if he suddenly decided to end my life, i would embrace it, because i genuinely cannot take any more of this. i screamed about the fact that i've stopped feeling real happiness for years. i was alone in my bedroom while doing all this, but i know she heard it, because i heard her crying outside.

this is but her latest megalomaniac episode, which has gotten increasingly more frequent now that my brother, her favorite child, is about to get married. she's inserting herself in decisions, second-guessing their calls, and even now, questioning the gift i decided to give him. momzilla is hardly the term to describe it. she even called their wedding venue ugly and questioned whether my brother's fiancee has ""seen a genuinely beautiful wedding, because she doesn't seem to have attended any if that's her venue."" 

because my brother threatened to pull her out of the guest list if she pulled more shit like that, she's trained her eyes on us, her two other children, and trying to get us to pass her message along to the two about certain wedding decisions. if she doesn't get her way, she calls us stupid, morons, good for nothings. but we've (my other sister) endured all that, because we wanted to act like a buffer to our mom so they could make decisions at their pleasure, and so we could protect their peace for a bit.

but i genuinely cannot stand this anymore. my brother's wedding is on the 14th of december. i don't know how much more i could stomach. the closer we get to the wedding date, the more that joy leaks out of my body. i am genuinely getting more and more depressed and more and more unhappy about this whole thing, which is so unfair to my brother and sister, whom i love more than anything. more than my parents. 

i suppose i just wanted to let this out. i know there's no solution and i'm to blame too for the way that i've acted. but sometimes i wonder why moms love to push us to the edge and then act surprised why we're suddenly lashing back. the excuse about how it's never good to act back because they're still your parents ring so phony to me. are we not equals as humans? are they the only ones allowed to feel pain? did she birth me into this world simply to become her punching bag? am i expected to strip myself of dignity just so she could exercise her ""right"" as a mother? when i'm hurt, do i not have the right to act hurt? or are there only ""acceptable ways"" of doing so, such that it actually only emboldens her to minimize me and degrade me more?

\*Campus Ministry Office of the Technological University of the Philippines.

Altar server asks me to report back to the office to guard it until someone can lock the door. The Mass starts in about 20 minutes. I arrive at the Office (about half the length of the campus away from the chapel). The priest has just come in for coffee and snacks. Maybe he hasn't even had breakfast yet. I greet Father and he asks me to have some snacks. It's all in these cutesy plastic packs. I accept and decide to not have communion.

There's dried bananas, tofu chips, and this other thing---*butcheron.* I've had it many times before. He always brings this stuff back to the office and shares it around and I love him for it. I refuse the coffee, though.

The first time I ever had *butcheron*, Father said it was a kind of deep-fried mushroom that tastes like meat. I do love it. I take some and eat it. We sit around and talk for a bit. I assist in moving some more equipment for the Mass and decide to head back to the office for another handful of that wonderful mushroom stuff.

I return to the office and there's like 6 other students in there now talking to Father. I squeeze in for more of the *butcheron* but the bag has disappeared from the table. I ask around for it. ""Where's the mushrooms? The *butcheron!""*

""Oh! Here ya go!"" one of the girls say.

""There it is! Thanks! I swear, this stuff is amazing. It really tastes like meat!"" I say, shoving the chips into my mouth.

""... because it's meat,"" she says.

""No, no! It's mushroom. Father said so.""

""No. It's meat. It's... deep-fried esophagus.""

""No, it's mushroom. I'll show you."" I pull up my phone and look for *butcheron* online...

1oqwj7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oqwj7m/did_i_accuse_my_ex_of_cheating_if_so_how_to/,"Did I accuse my ex of cheating? If so, how to communicate in a relationship?","Hello everyone. 



I'll only describe this one situation of the breakup of the long distance relationship because I'd like to know if this isolated part is considered a cheating accusation, without any of the emotional turmoil that lead to it:

After a very taxing breakup talk, I felt some emotions coming up.

She said that she loved me, but that we can't be together. But during the talk, it didn't feel like she was even willing to try to figure out things together or work on it anymore.

So the question in me arose ""Did she already move on? If so, why? How?""

My mind was racing and at some point, an insecurity came up. She was already feeling less and less energetic during some time before the breakup happened. She also told me about a guy that wanted to grab a coffee with her before the breakup. 

My thought was that maybe she wanted to break up earlier, but didn't have the strength to tell me before. Then, when the guy asked to grab a coffee, she decided to take him up on that offer to figure out if an in-person relationship really is what she wants and needs right now to be happier or if that is just something her mind was making up during a stressful phase. And when that was something that felt right to her, when she got confirmation that this was something that would really make her happy, she needed to gather the strength to finally break things off with me.

For me, it wasn't about the guy. It could have been anyone, but I want to be as honest here as I was with her: I could have imagined her thinking of the guy as nice and maybe even got a little interested in him after they met. After all, if she did this, the relationship would have mentally been over for her at that time.

But that was not my point. For me, the guy was just a way for her to assure that an in-person relationship really is what she needed. It could have been anyone.

I never could have imagined that she would have went to the meeting if she had feelings for the guy already. The main question that I had was if she had already checked the relationship off.

I didn't even think of this as very likely and at least I was able to communicate that as well. 

What I wasn't able to communicate is that I thought that I should be honest & open with my partner as soon as these thoughts come up, so we can talk about it and work on things before thoughts like these even have the chance to foster. I could have definitely said nothing, as for me it wasn't even a big deal.

I could have never imagined her having an affair, be it emotionally or physically, after all. However, I knew that while she did not. I should have realized that things like these need way better handling and should not be talked about in such a emotionally loaded situation.

For me, the situation was over when she said ""nope"". That was all I needed, as for me, there was no real trust issue there. I just wanted to communicate that I had gotten insecure and that I had a bad thought. I told her that it was over for me with that and that all is well for me then.

\-----

So, at that time, it didn't even appear to me as cheating really. Bad behaviour? Yes. But cheating? I knew that having this thought was bad and that I was thinking something I shouldn't and didn't want to about my partner. That is why I tried to communicate. Everything else would have felt like I am hiding something from my partner.

But now I am not so sure anymore. Did I accuse her of cheating? 

And if so, how would you handle a situation where thoughts like this come to your mind? I still feel like not telling feels like I'm hiding something. Something I shouldn't. I was and am always a big supporter of open and honest communication. For me, that is the only way for a relationship to last.

Thanks to everyone who gave me support and advice the first time.

The short release helped me motivate myself a bit, but it did not help with executive function at all. Still was struggling with more challenging/scary tasks, but it had more positives than negatives. Went from 20mg a day week one to 40mg by week 3, helped me fill the ""hollow"" feeling in my chest I get when I'm unmotivated/unmedicated, but no exec-function or concentration help. Some side effects (one day some weird mood swings) but after some advice from this sub tried lower dose w/ coffee and that helped. Someone suggested the extended release instead, which my doc let me get a couple days ago (40mg). 

Today is the second day with it - yesterday I noticed even less of an effect than the IR and overall besides a few heart palptations didn't really do much. Today I just feel tired, outright depressed and completely unmotivated. Even things that usually cheer me up are not helping at all. I don't even want to see my friends/gf and just sit in my room alone, but even then don't feel like doing anything. I tried my best to get good sleep (I understand how important that is) but last night was tough and when I woke up today I couldn't fall asleep again (probably only got 6-7 hrs) I've made sure to eat/drink lots of water/meditate too. 

Quick TLDR: I'd gladly try another medication, but I'm in Austria and Ritalin is the only thing covered by our national insurance, thus I really want tp get it to work! 

Any advice/sympathy would be massively appreciated. ",2,1762527206.0,ADHD,10,1.0,False

I was built to be a warning. 

My entire purpose was to be rooted in the rocks, to stand still, and to keep others away from the very danger I live with. I am the light that shines on the jagged edges.

You were the ship. All motion, all adventure, all storm.

And you saw my light. Instead of steering clear, you sailed right for me. You were the only one who ever did.

What were we thinking? A ship is meant to sail. A lighthouse is meant to stay. We were beautiful, and we were impossible. We were doomed from that first moment, weren't we?

I loved you for it. I hated you for it.

You crashed against my foundations. You showed me what the ocean felt like. For the first time, I wasn't just a warning; I was a destination. I wasn't just shining into the void; I was shining for you. You were my mirror , the only thing that ever reflected my light back at me.

But the harbor was too small for you. The rocks were too safe. You needed the storm. I knew you would.

I still have that map you drew on the back of a coffee-stained napkin. The one showing all the places you were going to go. I keep it in the drawer, next to the lens wipes. I hate it. I look at it every single day.

I hate that I'm still here, and you're out there. I hate that I can't be angry, because you were just being what you are. A ship has to sail.

I can still smell your jacket. It smells like coffee and rain.

I don't know if I'm writing this for you or for me. Maybe it’s just a new way to be the lighthouse. To send a signal I know you'll never see.

A lighthouse can't follow a ship into the sea. It just... watches.

And it keeps the light on. Just in case you ever get lost in the dark and need to find your way home. Even though I know you're never coming back.

1oqwd7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/1oqwd7m/the_sighted_mind/,The Sighted Mind,"It happened a few days back. Blind as a bat, I ran into a story that made my blood boil.

The girl had a pinch of sight left—just enough not to bump into things. Like peering through a window thick with smoke. And then one day that smoke turned solid and poof! Gone. Blind.

“Welcome to the club,” I thought.

The poor thing shrank from the fright. Naturally. At twenty, instead of grabbing the world by the reins, she found herself caged. And mind you, she’s no deadweight. She fiddles with her phone, keeps her place neat, brews coffee, cooks lunch, even scrubs the bathroom till it shines.

But she can’t walk the streets alone.

So I said, “Go learn. Tame your cane.”

Said it grudgingly, but said it. Deep down, I’ve always had a bone to pick with this new fad—sighted instructors teaching blind folks how to walk. Madness! Like hiring a blind man to teach truck driving. Sheer nonsense!

Still, better than nothing. The sighted fellow, bless him, can teach technique—how the cane sweeps the ground, the proper step, how to sense a curb. But he can’t teach the main thing: trust and street cunning.

The girl liked the idea, got all fired up, even made plans.

But... ah, there’s always a but when sighted folks get involved.

Her mother stomped her foot. “No, ma’am! Too dangerous! My daughter out there alone? For what? To wind up paralyzed under some truck? Not a chance!”

And as if that wasn’t enough, she pulled the great modern ghost from her sleeve:

“What about electric cars, huh? They’re everywhere now! Don’t make a sound! Sneak up like cats! If even the old blind folks won’t survive that, how could my poor girl? No, no, I won’t allow it! The world’s changed—blind people can’t walk alone anymore!”

“Oh, if only it were a guide dog,” she sighed, “then maybe I could trust it.”

Little does she know: a guide dog’s ten times trickier than a cane. And here’s the kicker—the schools won’t even look at you till you’re a master of that cane.

I told her so. “First the cane.”

The mother kept on, hammering away, raising the devil.

The girl, already scared, piled her fear on top of her mother’s terror.

I felt sorry for her. No—that’s not it. I felt angry. Tried to argue, to show what foolishness this all was. Told her it’s the same old yarn we blind folks have been hearing since the dawn of time.

When streetcars came around, screeching on the rails, the sighted world cried, “That’s it! The blind’ll be chopped to bits by those trams!”

Then came the gasoline cars, and the same holler: “Now it’s over! With that crazy speed, the blind’ll be flattened at every corner!”

Then television in the fifties: “Poor souls! Culture’s all pictures now! They’ll be shut out forever!”

The nineties brought computers and the internet: “A blind man’ll never use that! Never read a screen!”

And two thousand ten? Phones without buttons? “The end! Game over! Without the feel of keys, they’re finished!”

And here we are, swiping our fingers over smooth glass.

It’s always the same old litany. The same fear dressed up as love.

What that mother’s doing, in the name of affection, is a crime.

She’s poisoning her daughter with the worst sickness a blind soul can catch: a sighted mind.",11,1762526951.0,Blind,3,0.92,False

1oqwazy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Decorfurnist/comments/1oqwazy/how_can_you_make_a_small_room_look_spacious/,How can you make a small room look spacious without renovating?,"Making a small room look spacious **without renovating** is all about clever design, lighting, and smart use of furniture. With the right strategies, you can create the illusion of space while keeping the room functional and stylish. Here’s a detailed, professional guide:

**✅ 1. Use Light Colors for Walls and Ceilings**

* **Why it works:** Light shades like white, cream, soft pastels, or pale gray reflect more light, making a room feel airy.
* **Tip:** Paint the ceiling a shade lighter than the walls to visually lift the height.
* Accent with subtle, natural textures in décor to keep the space warm.

**✅ 2. Optimize Natural Light**

* Maximize windows by keeping curtains sheer or using blinds that fully retract.
* Avoid blocking windows with large furniture.
* Use mirrors opposite windows to reflect sunlight, instantly brightening the room.

**✅ 3. Choose Multi-Functional Furniture**

* Opt for **furniture that serves multiple purposes**, such as: Sofa beds Storage ottomans Wall-mounted desks
* Slimline furniture with clean lines works best—avoid bulky shapes.

**✅ 4. Create Vertical Interest**

* Draw the eye upward to make the room feel taller: Tall bookshelves or cabinets Vertical wall art Floor-to-ceiling curtains
* Vertical stripes on walls can also make ceilings seem higher.

**✅ 5. Use Mirrors Strategically**

* Mirrors expand the visual space.
* Place a large mirror on one wall or use mirrored furniture panels.
* A mirrored closet or sliding doors can make a small room feel double its size.

**✅ 6. Minimize Clutter**

* Less is more. Keep surfaces tidy and avoid overcrowding the room with décor.
* Use hidden storage boxes, baskets, or furniture with built-in storage.
* Keep decorative items minimal but intentional.

**✅ 7. Layer Lighting**

* Use **multiple light sources** instead of a single ceiling light: Table lamps Floor lamps Wall sconces
* Warm, well-distributed lighting creates depth and makes the room feel bigger.

**✅ 8. Choose Reflective or Light Furniture Finishes**

* Glass, acrylic, or glossy surfaces appear less bulky.
* Transparent furniture, like acrylic chairs or glass coffee tables, “disappear” visually.
* Light wood or white-painted furniture blends seamlessly, opening up the room.

**✅ 9. Use Rugs to Define Space**

* Use small or medium rugs to **define functional zones** without cutting the visual flow.
* Keep patterns minimal to avoid making the room feel busy.

**✅ 10. Smart Wall and Shelf Placement**

* Floating shelves free up floor space and draw the eye upward.
* Mount TVs or other electronics to walls to reduce furniture footprint.
* Avoid heavy wall décor that visually “weighs down” the room.

**🌟 Extra Tip**

You can subtly boost energy and mood in a small space with **natural elements**, like a small potted plant or a textured natural fiber basket. This not only brings life to the room but also enhances the sense of openness and wellness.",1,1762526804.0,Decorfurnist,0,1.0,False
1oqwawl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1oqwawl/at_my_breaking_point/,At my breaking point,"I’m so tired of being treated like shit at MY JOBBB, like why is everyone so fucking miserable.

“No I can’t check you in, you’re not 21.”
Immediately gets yelled at and told I’m wrong.

“No ma’am I do not have a room available at the moment (it’s 9:45 AM and we were sold out the night before).”
Immediately gets told I should’ve had a room ready.
“But I requested an 11 am check in.”
REQUEST REQUEST REQUESSSSSSST. Not a guarantee.

I have worked by myself the last week during sold out nights, dealing with the worst guests I’ve ever met. Not only do they not listen to the policies at check in, but they call me names IN FRONT OF ME. I can’t do anything about it since my hotel cares more about the guest (high turnover). I have been screamed at, called names, told I’m wrong and don’t know how to do my job, all in one week.

Not only that but if you see a line at the desk, is that time to ask me for coffee cups for the comp coffee? Or cream and sugar? I was busy dealing with a situation with a line and one of the other guests (they all knew each other) decides to interrupt and ask if she can go grab them. No ma’am you cannot go into the employee area to grab cups. No I cannot leave the desk at the moment to grab them. No I don’t have the time to grab caramel hazelnut creamer… is that even a thing? No I don’t have time to get sugar…. No i am not sure if it’s organic cane sugar. Why don’t I know? BECAUSE I DONT CARE.

I was threatened three times in one shift because I didn’t provide refunds for something the guest did. No I won’t be giving you my full name and personal information. No I don’t care if you call corporate, this is a privately owned hotel. There is no corporate, it’s owned by one dude like omg.

Stop bothering front desk agents when they’re clearly busy and running around. I get it you want something but if I have to leave the desk unattended for it, then no I’m not doing it. We’re overworked and underpaid. I didn’t eat all day for all five of my shifts because of them. Not even  a chip.",21,1762526798.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,7,0.96,False
1oqwagq,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1oqwagq/former_friends_wants_to_restart_the_friendship/,Former friends wants to restart the friendship. Should I accept?,"I used to be in this friend group then suddenly these people forgot about me. I was diissapointed and frustrated how they stopped inviting me out and just moved on. 

  
Then I bumped into one of the guys. He saw me and got my attention. He approached me and asked if it was really me and I politely said yes. THen he goes ""OMG I MISS YOU"". In my mind I was thinking ""What the hell. This guy stopped tagging me along and acts like this?"" I would not say it as it is not right. He asked if I can have coffee with him. I said fine but I did it because I wanna see if he can explain himself. 

  
After a lengthy conversation he asked why I suddenly went off grid. In my head I was upset and mad because he stopped inviting me and acts like Im the one who wanted out. I just told him keeping a straight face ""You guys stopped inviting me. You had birthdays and meetups and I was not included. I though you don't want to be friends with me so I stopped contacting you. I didn't go off grid you forgot me"".

  
He explained himself. He apologized how I felt then tried to make me understand why I was forgotten. He explained that everyone but me in the friend group now live near each other. THe people who used to live nearer to me now moved out of their houses and live in the same city as the others. They started seeing each other more often and since I wasn't living there, I was not part. He gave ""Im sorry if I forgot about you but I will make it up."" He told me he has a plan to have a karaoke night with the others and he wants me there. He is urging me to come. He told me they will be happy Im there. I said ""Let's see if I am busy but I will tell you"".

I stilll have not decided but IDK about his reason. He forgot about me because Im the only one who lives far? That seems kind of odd and suspicious. Inviting me Im thinking ""Does he feel bad or does he really want to apologize and reignite our friendship?"" The Karaoke is in two weeks tho but still Im wondeirng if these guys truly miss me or if it will be a one night thing with me then they will forget about me again.

They say they age their heavy cream a day or two depending on what video I watch.  

Does anyone know if they are whipping it a day or two ahead of time and then letting it fall flat over that day or two then rewhipping right before pouring.  I have seen them use the immersion blender to whip the heavy cream directly before pouring the cream.

Also, I saw they use heavy whipping cream - I believe they use Strauss, not sure if a cheaper heavy cream with Carregens in it for a stabilizer makes it harder or easier to float on top and / or impacts the final drink - I would imagine not…how you whip it makes a bigger final impact - it’s only 6 ounces total so every bit may make a difference ",1,1762526705.0,Tiki,0,1.0,False

Im after a chill pub in the centre where me and some friends can play a board game and have some coffee rather than a pint as we're driving.

I know Chance and Counters does board games, but this is a game we're bringing with us so I don't want to pay for a table there as I don't need to use their games.

I just want a chilled pub that wouldn't mind me cracking a board game open, that serves coffee.

1oqw7ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/anno1404/comments/1oqw7ot/tips_for_the_emirate_achievement/,"Tips for ""The Emirate"" Achievement","Of all the Achievements required to get the Golden Flagship, the one I found the most difficult was The Emirate. To complete the Sultan's Mosque in 5 hours you must lay the foundation in 2 hours or less because it takes 3 hours to build from start to finish. You need 1740 Envoys and 50,000 coin to start the Mosque. You therefore need to build the first 100 Nomad houses as quickly as possible and get 70 houses to Envoy level and fully occupied to start the Mosque. The most critical resource is quartz because you need to make a lot of mosaic... I managed it with 6 quartz deposits, I think it might be possible with 5 but I wouldn't swear to it.

Your northern population is purely for income, and to that end I recommend about 300 houses, get 70 or 80 to Patrician level but don't bother supplying any Patrician level goods except bread because you don't have time to recoup the initial costs of other goods.

I did it with only 3 islands: The north island has Cider, Hemp and Wheat fertitlities. The main south island has Dates, Indigo, Silk, and Coffee Beans. The support island has Spices, Clay and Roses. You might need 2 coral reefs although I got lucky and found one by a long beach that enabled me to put all 7 Pearl fisheries in the same place.

I did not produce Marzipan at all... passive buy and only release to fill new Envoy houses then deny until the next expansion.

Delay producing Glass until you're into the second stage of Mosque construction and shut down 2 of your mosaic production chains to make enough quartz available to build a stock of glass before the final stage begins. Do not waste any glass on Church or Prison as it won't make any difference to your tax income.

You need to make tools in both cities so look for islands that have plenty of iron. You will need plenty of Stone in the north to promote houses to Patrician as soon as possible, and at least one stone deposit on your main south island. 

Build both cities simultaneously to ensure you have enough money to start the Sultan's Mosque when it unlocks... this was the hardest.

Do as many quests as you can to gain honour. Try to find islands that naturally have the fertilities mentioned above so that you don't have to spend any honour points on seeds. Also, use southern islands that have plenty of green soil as you probably won't be able to afford norias. Just keep loading random maps until you find one that has what you need. (Scout the maps with the Reveal turned on, then when you find a suitable map, screenshot it then restart with the revealed map off)

Ships: If you choose the right islands *you will not need to build any ships* for the entire game. Use the warship for quests. Small trader for the spice run (and building materials to the support island). Caravel for Quartz. Mosaic and Perfume. If the support island doesn't have enough green space for Potash, use the spice ship to transport Quartz to the main north island and make your glass there. Use the Flagship for taking scrolls to the Grand Vizer and miscellaneous deliveries, but be wary of using it for quests as it has a larger range of vision than the other ships and may inadvertently reveal enemy territory.

**EASY CHEAT** : Playing with all Hard AIs gives you a huge amount of difficulty points, but you can effectively eliminate them from the game right at the start. If you keep your ships in your own territory and never reveal an enemy island, they will not trouble you in any way as long as you turn off the City Council. Just choose a map that enables you to sail between your own islands and the free traders without revealing the AI players. This enables you to set many of the other conditions to easier levels. Playing with Plague ON is more freebie difficulty points because you're not going to Noblemen level at any point so there will never be a plague.

Here are the settings I used to qualify as a ""Hard"" game:

All 3 star AI. Corsairs OFF.

Map size HUGE. Islands size MEDIUM

Fertilities MANY. Construction EASY. Raw materials MANY

Neutral powers OFF. Refund OFF. Quests MANY

Fire OFF. Tornado OFF. Plague ON. Sandstorm OFF. Thunderstorm OFF. Volcano ON

Flagship with Armada. 300 Honour. 80,000 coin. Start item OFF

Revealed map OFF. Sabotage OFF. City council OFF

Final points... save regularly so that when quests are offered that would require you to sail outside your safe zones you can reload. You absolutely need many quests for the honour points so don't reject them, just keep reloading until you get a suitable one. And I played the entire game on slow speed. No way could I have done it at normal speed so massive kudos to you if you can do it in real time.",0,1762526576.0,anno1404,1,0.5,False
1oqw6tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1oqw6tj/why_wont_my_meal_prep_containers_hold_heat_well/,Why won't my meal prep containers hold heat well?,"Hey everyone,

So I've been meal prepping for about a year now, and I kept running into this super annoying problem. My food would be piping hot when I packed it, but by lunchtime it was barely warm. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong or bought cheap containers, but turns out there's actually some science behind why meal prep containers don't hold heat well.

First off, most meal prep containers are designed for storage and portability, not heat retention. They're usually made from thin plastic or glass that doesn't insulate your food at all. Heat basically escapes right through the walls and lid. It's like trying to keep coffee hot in a regular cup versus a thermos – totally different results.

The main issue is insulation. Your standard food storage containers have zero insulation properties. The material is thin because it needs to be stackable and microwave-safe, which makes sense for reheating but terrible for keeping things warm. Air gaps between the container and lid also let heat escape faster than you'd think.

Another thing I learned is that the type of food matters too. Stuff with high water content like soups and stews cools down quicker than drier foods. The liquid conducts heat away from your meal faster. Also, if you're packing hot food and then putting it straight in the fridge, you're basically asking for it to cool down completely.

Here's what actually helped me: I upgraded to better quality containers that are specifically designed for meal prep. I found some really solid options through [this collection of meal prep containers](https://athomewave.com/meal-prep-containers) that actually have better sealing and thicker walls. The difference was honestly night and day.

Some other quick fixes that worked for me:

- Preheat your container with hot water before adding food
- Pack foods tightly so there's less air space
- Use insulated lunch bags with ice packs (sounds backwards but it regulates temperature)
- Reheat right before eating instead of expecting it to stay hot for hours

If you're serious about keeping your prepped meals at the right temperature, investing in proper containers is worth it. Check out [these options](https://athomewave.com/meal-prep-containers) if you want something that actually works better than the dollar store stuff.

Bottom line: regular meal prep containers aren't meant to be thermoses. They're designed for storage and reheating. Once I accepted that and got containers with better build quality, my meal prep game improved big time.

I can’t tell if that was just polite or if she genuinely meant it. She’s really busy.. kids, career, top social life, a lot on her plate,i really don’t want to be needy or making things awkward by reaching out for advice.

1oqw2qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/kettlebell/comments/1oqw2qn/on_choosing_your_first_kettlebells/,On choosing your first kettlebell(s),"Hey all, how’s it going? 👋  
Yes, you: the one eye-ing that lonely kettlebell in the corner of your home gym (or living room, aka *“*Courage Corner*”*).

Hope your coffee’s hot, your playlist’s fire, and your floor mat isn’t going to bounce during swings. Good to see you. Okay, let’s chat about choosing your first kettlebell(s).



**Why we keep seeing “I bought one, was it the right weight?” posts**

This sub has become a bit of a safe haven for first-time ballers. Plenty of folks slide into here with:

* “I want to kettlebell workout: what weight should I start with?”
* “I bought *these* many kettlebells: did I do well?”
* “I bought one and it’s too heavy / too light: now what?”

Kettlebells (and weights in general) are not cheap, and since the new training from home wave, it’s even more tempting to hit “Buy” and call it a day. Everyone wants a home gym (I even miss when we used to call it *“*living room*”*). But before you become the proud owner of a steel orb that haunts your floors, let’s make sure you’re doing it smart.



**What are people recommending? …And are they right?**

What do the pros + community say:

* Somewhere you might read that for beginners: men should start around **12 kg to 24 kg** (26–53 lbs) and women around **8 kg to 16 kg** (18–35 lbs)
* Folks who like to put strength first, claim minimum for men at least a **16 kg (35 lb)** bell, and women maybe an **8 kg (18 lb)** or 12 kg (26 lb)
* ""Generally 12kg or 16kg should be a good starting point. 12kg if you have little to no upper‐body strength (or 10kg if you’re downright scrawny) and 16kg if you’ve got some mass there."" and “The general recommendation is to pick a weight you can press overhead for around 5 reps. … 12kg or 16kg (for fit healthy males). Then maybe a second slightly heavier one (20-24kg).” You might recognise these 2 quotes from a nice, down to earth community here on reddit...

So yes, those numbers are *generally* right as broad guidelines, but not always right for *you*. Why? Because the right weight depends on your current strength, your mobility, your goals, your workout style (swings vs snatches vs get-ups), and yes, your sanity (do you want a bell you’ll instantly outgrow and regret? do you want a bell that sits there immobile till you somehow develop the strength to lift it 3cm off the floor?).  
To know what’s *right*, you might ask:

* Can I do a 5-8 rep overhead press (single arm) with good form on this weight?
* Can I do a set of swings, perhaps 10-15 reps, without my form falling to bits or my back cursing me the next day?
* Do I feel *challenged* but *not completely defeated*?
* Does the handle feel comfortable in my hand, and can I easily manipulate it without wrist/forearm revolt?

If you answer yes to those, you’re in a good zone.



**Why a gym test-drive Is the smartest £5–£30 you’ll ever spend**

Before you drop your hard-earned money on a shiny new kettlebell that’ll glare at you from the corner for eternity, here’s a revolutionary idea: **try before you buy**.

Grab a daily pass or even a one-month membership at a local gym, ideally one that actually *has* kettlebells, not just machines that squeak. Then go experiment like a mad scientist. Swing the 12 kg, press the 16 kg, curse at the 20 kg, and find your sweet spot. Try doubles, singles, complexes, all the moves you’ve been studying before.

Because here’s the truth: no one on the internet (not even this sub) knows your body better than you do.  
Asking for advice is great (we love you for it), but the best data point in the universe is your own body saying “this feels right” or “oh hell no.” You can read 50 Reddit threads and still end up with a weight that’s wrong for *you*. Five minutes under a real bell will tell you more than five hours of forum debate ever will.

And the money part? Yeah, a gym pass might cost you £5–£30, depending on where you are. But that’s still cheaper and infinitely smarter, than impulse-buying a £70+ kettlebell you don’t even like.

So pay for access once, twice, even thrice. Treat it like an experiment. Think of it as a research, not an expense. Because even if you decide kettlebells aren’t your thing, you’ve saved yourself a small fortune, space and maybe a bruised ego (and forearm).

**TL;DR:**  
**Try first. Ask second. Think overnight. Then buy, maybe.**

me: ""your dog is so cute! what kind is it?""

her: ""oh he's a bichon frise! his name is marshmallow""

MARSHMALLOW. I died. so i told her that's the perfect name and we ended up talking for like 5 minutes about her dog, how she got him, his personality (apparently he's scared of leaves???), and then somehow we got onto talking about the coffee shop's new menu items.

when my order came up I said ""nice talking to you!"" and she said ""you too dear, have a wonderful day!""

and like... that's it. that was the whole interaction. but i'm sitting here smiling because:

1. i initiated a conversation with a stranger and didn't die
2. it felt NATURAL, not forced or scripted
3. she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me
4. it made both of our days a little better i think

So this all started around 10 yrs back when all of a sudden one day i have left flank lower pain which lasted around 2 days and after that it was all fine i thought it must’ve been a virus or something. From that point on i was experiencing pain around 2 months a year on and off l but no diarrhoea or constipation. I keep living my life like that never thought it could be something serious. 

For the last 6 months the symptoms were really bad with occasional constipation, i visited a doc and she ordered colonoscopy and after test my doc she said i have ibs and my colon and intestines are swollen and i also have haemorrhoids, she gave me tablets to have and also told me to not have milk,meat,tea and coffee etc. so i started taking medication and for the first 2 days it was almost like no pain,gas or bloating but from 3rd day onwards all symptoms came back but suppressed. Im totally confused whats going on with my body, i really think this could or could not be ibs, maybe some inflammation disease or something else ? To more describe the pain i face - sudden pain/discomfort which comes and go in turns. 

Please if someone encounter this or maybe similar and can point me to a direction.

Right now I’m in Asheville, NC and while it’s beautiful here mountains, coffee shops, good vibe, I’ve realized I’m struggling more with the social side of this lifestyle than I expected.  
  
I’m pretty introverted and get anxious about approaching people especially when I don’t know anyone in a new place. I’ll go to a coffee shop or coworking space and want to start a conversation but then I overthink it and just end up working quietly all day. Even when I go out to a bar or event it feels like everyone already has their group.  
The freedom of remote work is amazing I can live anywhere but it’s weirdly made me feel more alone than before.

1oqvzfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1oqvzfv/how_intermittent_fasting_changed_my_life/,How Intermittent Fasting Changed My Life..,"Just as the pandemic began to tighten its grip on the world, I was freshly coming to terms with the fact that my nine-month marriage was heading toward separation and soon, divorce. The discovery of infidelity shattered me, and depression began to peak alongside the global crisis. Life felt like it was collapsing from all sides. No gyms, no gatherings, no social life, no friends - just long, physically demanding shifts as a driver, often stretching beyond ten hours. With public restrooms closed, coffee shops became my only option, and each stop meant grabbing a coffee or a savory snack, regardless of the time. I was entering a pre-diabetic phase, driven by high rice consumption and poor eating habits. I began with a 12-hour fast, hoping to regain control. But it wasn’t practical with my work schedule. Eventually, I let go of overtime shifts and made a bold move to take a new job working from home. That decision changed everything.

With more control over my day, I shifted to a 14-hour fast. I skipped breakfast and developed a habit of drinking black coffee blended with ghee. It gave me energy and focus. Slowly, I extended my fast to 16 hours, then 18. My meals were still rooted in South Indian cuisine, but I made conscious changes. I reduced rice, increased lentils, and used less oil for vegetables. I began experimenting with Thai and Malay vegan curries using tempeh and tofu. My hunger and cravings started to fade. By month four, fasting felt natural. I woke at 5:45 AM, walked 5 kilometers in a high-visibility jacket after my bullet coffee, worked from home, ate a high-protein, low-carb lunch, and walked another 3 to 5 kilometers after work. Netflix became my evening companion, and this routine carried me through seven months of solitude.

In January, I joined a running group. It was a cold, snow-filled month, but I ran in sub-zero temperatures. I came home with pink cheeks, teary eyes, and a refreshed body. By month eight and a half, I was doing OMAD, fasting for 22 hours with a 2-hour eating window. I started at 172 pounds at 5'4"", and by month nine, I was down to 129 pounds. It was more than just weight loss. It was a complete transformation. My energy soared, my mind cleared, and I felt in control of my body for the first time in years. Life slowly returned to normal, but the habits I built stayed with me. Even as I gained some weight back, I knew exactly what worked for me.

Now, I am starting again at 153 pounds. I am not chasing 129, but aiming for a strong and sustainable 135. This journey was never just about food or fasting. It was about reclaiming my life during a time when everything felt lost. It was about choosing discipline over despair and building a lifestyle that supports both physical and mental resilience. If you are standing at the edge of change, wondering if it is possible, know that it is. 

Start small. Stay consistent. Let your transformation unfold.",8,1762526014.0,intermittentfasting,2,0.84,False
1oqvyno,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1oqvyno/i_feel_so_useless_sometimes/,I feel so useless sometimes.,"My wife drove my son to his bus stop this morning. It's about half a mile from our house. After he got on the bus, she called me, our vehicle had a flat. I took her our portable air compressor to air it up,  but it wasn't doing much good. We managed to get it aired up enough so she could drive it back to our house. She called someone that was going to take it to get it repaired, but said we would have to get it off the vehicle first.  A lot of frustration just getting the thing jacked up. I started having a meltdown during everything. This really disrupted my whole morning routine. I didn't even get breakfast before this crap happened.Right now I'm sitting inside flipping out for being so useless while my wife is out there getting her mother to help.
And what bothers me even more is 5-10 years ago this crap wouldn't have bothered me so much. But I'm still burnt out from too much stress a few years ago, and I can't handle getting a cup of decaf coffee late, let alone an actual emergency like a flat tire.

1oqvyb7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqvyb7,Double dinner,"This past Friday I had a few rations from the stash and forgot to post the review for these two. First up was a 2019 Indian chicken Canadian IMP and a Lamb, lentil and rice NAFR. The IMP came with a load of stuff to eat and I ended up eating the main, tortillas, fruit salad and coffee crisp bar. I ate the peanut butter and jam later on some 1980s MRE crackers. If you haven't had those before find them and get them. They're scrumtrulescent and I'm amazed every time I open a pack. Enough about those now. 

I'm having the milk chocolate drink with the espresso powder for breakfast this morning. The drink is like a cross between Ovaltine and a protein shake and is absolutely delicious. I compare to the cocoa beverage powder from old US MREs in quality. It doesn't have that weird protein shake aftertaste and mixed with espresso makes for an excellent cup of army mocha. 10/10 for me and would love to buy a stash of the chocolate drink. 

The fruit salad was a bit oxidized but otherwise fine. It's the same fruit salad I remember getting in elementary and high school. It wasn't the best then and still isn't the best now but works in a pinch. 5/10 as it's nothing special and the apples are far superior. The coffee crisp bar had definitely seen better days and was probably something else in it's prime but the years of hard living were catching up. It's a solid bar with a light, crispy texture. Basically like a KitKat but less dense. Not a big coffee flavor but it's there. It needed a bit more coffee flavor but otherwise I enjoyed it. 8/10 for me, more coffee and probably a 10/10. The drink was a pretty standard lemon/lime drink. Nothing special and had a decent flavor. You get two and you need to use both for a full drink. 6/10, Gatorade lemon lime is better but I'd drink this during strenuous activity. 

The main for this one is the Indian chicken. It was fairly saucy and had loads of chicken. The sauce was a tomato based, well flavored curry. It was a bit on the bald side but easily fixed by the Tabasco. It needed the Tabasco to give it the salt it needed and an added kick from the peppers and vinegar. The raisins are lost in it and I'm fine with that. But the thing that got me was how dry the chicken was. Drier than a Popeyes biscuit. If the chicken would've been tender and juicy it would score way higher...6.5/10 but because of the dry chicken. 

There wasn't a lot in what I ate from the IMP so I decided to dig into the NAFR and ate the main, burrito, chocolate and blueberry bar. The chocolate and bar are very standard in these rations and I've reviewed them before. The bars are good and rate high for me and the chocolate is solid too. This ration came with a Bridgeford jalapeño beef taco filled burrito and I tell you what that thing was delicious. It had a wonderful spice with a tender chew. I'm giving it a 9/10. A lot of rations can be ho-hum in their mediocrity but this small item adds a welcome wake up for the tastebuds. It'll be a pleasant surprise if you get one. I haven't had the US FSR taco sandwiche thing yet but hopefully it's close to this or is this item. 

The main is a freeze dried meal that has a rice base with lamb, lentils and other vegetables. These have huge portions and I struggled to finish it. My eyes were a bit bigger than my stomach but I powered through to the finish line. Flavorwise this had a lamb stew profile of herbs and onions. Basically taking the stew and cooking the rice in it. To help bulk it up there were loads of vegetables with chunks of carrot, onion and some leafy green. It also had loads of lamb that was tender after rehydration. The lamb was more like a gyro texture, so ground meat instead of stew chunks which gave it a more tender chew and allowed it to hydrate better. Overall this was a well thought out main and only needed a bit of salt to make it a tasty way to stuff oneself. 9/10 from me and definitely wouldn't turn it down. 

I'd eat both these rations again without much complaint. Go out and try them and any other ones you can find. Expand your palette and enjoy it. Stay safe and be kind to one another. ",15,1762525936.0,MRE,7,1.0,False

1oqvtjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1oqvtjc/poa_elder_abuse/,POA - Elder abuse,"What can I do if a person has not had a capacity assessment, according to the spouse that should know everything because he takes her everywhere, but the hospital and doctor say she doesn't need one ans is considered incapable as of her diagnoses.

Her diagnoses was before any POA. I took her for a POA because of the fact that i know he is/was abusive and was constantly talking about putting himself on her bank and getting POA. He blew up aftee her not signing a POA for property. She doesn't have much, just her bank account which he is using as his own. They recieve pension, but she had a lump sum of money in her bank. He keeps her card and will not lwt her have it, this has been ongoing for over a year. He dropped he off aftershe didnt sign the POA last time. It's a complicated situation, but she ended up back there. I guess because he found out what it was like without her as his bank account and knowing she was on  the list for LTC, he decided to put things in place for himself to keep her money.  He got a new POA and god know what else because he used a check of hers to pay over $1,200. The Manager at her bank spoke to her alone & then called me in. She said my mom said she didnt go to the law offive and he brought it home to sign. His is the most recent POA, so idk what will happen. The bank said if they have to take them at face value, his would count. 

My mom took out some money and I noticed her bank acvount was considerae low (my mom doesn't even know what she has know had). Turns out ""she"" transfered the bulk of her money into an investment the pays to her estate and in the meeting said ""she wanted it easily liqiudable in the case of (I'm not sure what. The woman kind of made a face abd skipped over.. so i think death). They printed a one moth statement so we could see, and i also saw another $180 payment to a lawyer. I think this may habe been the lawyer who did her will but im not sure. I googled and it is a will lawyer. I think he probably got her to switch everything to him, but she doesn't remember. 

I am not sure what to do. If I get something saying she wasn't capable to do these things, will the lawyers refund her money and cancel them. I thought part of becomming a lawyer was agreeing to act with ethics. There is no way a little old lady like her, being taken to lawyers by this man seems like he isn't coersing or intimidating her. I also don't believe she could get through these meetjng without askinv him what ro say or bwjng told someyhing at some point.

She was never a big spender and used to joke about him being a scrooge when they staed dating. He is using her bank to take them both out to eat 4x a week, spending 100's on beer (which she medically cannot have) etc. In just one month he spent over $6000 with $2000 being small (100-300) withdrawls throughout the month. The statement started 2 days after she went back to stay at his house, so there was alreay $5000 less then when i saw the balance last, which would have been a week prior. I  the month she didmt stay with him, she really didnt spend money except small amount on coffee, a couple hundred on lottery and a bit of groceries. I took her out shoppeing because he has all her things and she is bery prive concious still, she didn't buy a blanket because it was $15 and she thought it was too ecpensive.

It he is her POA my worry is he will take out money ""for her to use"" and not give her any and she will be left with nothing. She is in LTC rn which I really don't want her to have to be, but I dont have ahome for her to live in. Part of why she would do what he would say is because she didn't want to be kicked out and he would threaten ber with that. She seems calmer in general, i think from not being yelled at all the time, but she doesnt want to be in LTC. I'm afraid to get TV hooked up for her incase her takes ber out of there (since it will be on contract paid through her bank) I also don't have money to pay for things for her. I don't know if her would take her out of LTC or leave her since, he said previously be was trying to put her in LTC. I think he was just trying to make sure he could keep use of her money first... other wise her only have $900 a month pension, anda couple hundred top up from a dead wife's pension. Anyways, I am also struggling because even though he was yelling at her all the time, there is evidence he was physicallly abuse a few times, she was alone a lot there and he wouldnt let anyone take her out of visit, and she wasn't being taken care of... at least she was in a house and had her dog. 

Anyways. Any advice is appricated.

Also, this question is to people who are actually lawyers. If you were a lawyer that did her new POA or will and her family brought hwr back to tall to you, and you see she doesnt remember, but didn't want to make those changes, what would you do?

To note. I have spoken with a lawyer he took her to previously were she refused a POA and tge lawyer said it was clear she didnt trust him. Some people have seen her out with him recently and when he wasn't right by her side she was saying she needed to get out and was crying. I sent polive for a check after that, but she was telling them thing were fine. She is always saying she doesn't want to make him mad and doesn't want him to freak out though. I truly believe she just wanted to appease him because she has no oyher home. ",0,1762525616.0,legaladvicecanada,3,0.5,False

(Flashback)

It was 11:00 PM when Otto reached his destination. The Gignian Compact Zone was not a diplomatic mission; it was a gigantic, fenced-off industrial and residential area on the outskirts of Berlin. The night sky here wasn't lit by streetlights, but by the harsh, industrial floodlights of factories and the powerful lamps of the docks where super-fortresses were being built. The air was cold, and Otto felt his own, human fear mixing with a primal, reptilian anxiety.

Guards stood at the gate. Their armor looked alien—it was neither the human Guard armor nor the durable Plague carapaces he had seen in recordings. It was angular, symmetrical, gleaming dully in the light of the floodlights. Otto approached hesitantly.

To his surprise, one of the guards detached from the group and walked towards him. It was a male of his own species. A Taharagch. He was powerful, and his black, composite armor bore the same geometric sigil of the Compact that Otto had seen on W’thiara.

""She told me you would be. You must be Otto,"" the voice, processed by Otto’s translator, was rough but not hostile. The guard nodded to the others. ""Let him through.""

The gate opened with a hiss. The guard pointed a clawed hand deep into the complex.

""Head straight to the indicated address, about one of your Earth kilometers. Then 300 meters to the right, that's where our species' barracks are.""

Otto started walking at a steady pace, though his heart was pounding like a hammer. He felt eyes on him. There was movement all around, despite the late hour. It was the changing of the guard at the factories and shipyards. He saw representatives of many alien species passing him. Powerful, four-armed Gignians walked with heavy steps, their armor clanking. Beside them darted agile Naratans with hyena-like faces, laughing loudly at some private joke. They all wore the Compact sigil on their shoulders.

They were smiling at each other. Otto paused for a moment, seeing a scene that seemed surreal to him: one of his own brethren, a male Taharagch, walking next to a Gignian, patted him friendly on his massive armor. It looked like a real compact. A true alliance fighting for a better tomorrow.

He turned right, as instructed. And then he felt it.

He felt it in his nostrils. The same scent that had hit him in the park, but now it was magnified. Thick, musky, electrifying. Pheromones. The scent of females. Not one. An entire pack.

His reptilian instinct exploded. He felt a wave of heat at the base of his tail, and his body tensed in a way he could barely control. The fear vanished, replaced by pure, biological lust. He began to nervously press his own neck gland, trying to regain control, to suppress the instinct that had always been stifled and was now howling.

He reached the barracks. It was simple, functional. The door opened automatically.

He went inside. In the common room sat several female Taharagch. Their slender, powerful silhouettes in loose, civilian clothes were a sight that almost made Otto lose his breath.

""Oh, you're here,"" W’thiara said, looking up at him from some kind of data pad.

Several other females turned their heads towards him. Their gazes were shameless, appraising, amused.

""Is that him?"" he heard a voice in his translator. ""Not bad.""

Another one chuckled softly.

""A virgin.""

It was three in the morning. It was already over.

Otto lay on his stomach, breathing heavily. His back stung as if someone had run sandpaper over it. He knew it was covered in scratches. W’thiara had not been gentle; her long, sharp talons had dug into his scales and skin during the act with a force that had nothing in common with a human caress. It was a fight for dominance, a primal, brutal ritual that had awakened instincts he never knew he had. Fortunately, the nanites were already at work; he felt the characteristic, cool tingling as the microscopic machines patched up his tissues.

He rolled onto his side. The bedding was covered in blood. His blood.

""Jesus... am I... sorry?"" he croaked, still stunned by the intensity of the experience, assuming he had been the one to hurt her.

W’thiara lay beside him, calm, her breathing even. She stretched lazily like a panther.

""It's nothing, Otto,"" her voice in the translator was slightly amused. ""This blood is a good sign. Our copulation is quite brutal. We use claws and teeth to hold our partner. It's instinct. And your blood on the sheets..."" she ran a nail over his chest, ""...means I enjoyed myself.""

""Ah..."" Otto grunted. That was... new. Completely different from the cautious, human encounters he had tried. Trying to change the subject and calm his racing thoughts, he said, ""I saw many of our kind here. Males, too.""

""Yes,"" W’thiara sat up, leaning against the headboard. ""The planet the Compact liberated... Naratan... was actually a breeding world for the Plague Empire. When the Gignian Compact forces broke through the defenses, they found not just factories, but incubation facilities.""

""Willingly or not, they recovered over a billion small children. An entire generation, still in growth chambers. We were young, without the consciousness implant yet installed. Blank slates. The Compact saved us. They raised us. Gave us an education, a purpose. And this is how we live. As full citizens of the Compact.""

""Besides,"" she continued, breaking his silence, her voice becoming strangely distant, ""my original is still alive there. On Naratan. I am just her copy. Thanks to your idea of building allied fleets here, my original was designated for copying and transmission here.""

She ran her hand over his bare back, her touch now more probing than caressing.

""I am here alone. Even though I have her memories... my family, who is still there. Hundreds of light-years separate us.""

Otto felt a cold chill run down his spine, one that had nothing to do with arousal. The terror of the consequences.

""God... they copied you? They forced your consciousness into such a separation?""

W’thiara let out a low, throaty laugh. ""The Compact is logical. Compared to the Empire, the Compact are angels. I get regular quantum messages from all of them. I know how they're doing. It's enough. But..."" she trailed off, and her gaze became intense again. ""Speaking of consequences... How many eggs do you want?""

Otto blinked. His head was spinning.

""Eggs? What do you mean? An egg with a youngling?""

""Well, yes."" W’thiara propped herself up on her elbows, looking down at him. Her expression was completely serious, as if she were asking about the weather. ""Our cycle works differently. I was in heat. You were... available. I should expel them in a week. You just need to keep them warm for about three of your months, and they'll hatch on their own.""

""Just... like that?!"" Otto felt faint. This was worse than the pressure on his gland.

""Well, yes."" She shrugged. ""If you don't want the eggs, I'll just smash them all right after expelling them. They won't even be embryos yet. No problem.""

Otto tried to gather his thoughts. Children. Offspring. With her.

""And... and how many could there be?""

""From three to seven. Usually.""

""Oh God... I could have young. All seven of them."" The vision of seven small, silver-scaled reptilians running around his Berlin apartment was simultaneously terrifying and... wonderful.

W’thiara laughed aloud.

""Sex has its consequences, Otto.""

She leaned over him. Her long, sharp talon traced over his back, finding one of the healing wounds from their act. With a decisive, quick movement, she reopened it. Otto hissed in pain.

""These Swarm nanites of yours spoil all the fun,"" she muttered, watching as blood began to slowly seep onto the sheets again. ""I like it when marks are left behind.""

With the arrival of a larger, more diverse Gignian Compact population, including Naratans and other Taharagch, Otto's unique role as a Guard instructor diminished somewhat. He was still a legend and a veteran of the challenge, but he was no longer the sole expert on fighting his own kind. Suddenly, he had more time for himself.

He spent that time with W’thiara. They met whenever their schedules—his in the Guard, hers in the Compact shipyards—allowed. What had started in the park was not a one-time explosion. It was something much deeper, something Otto barely understood.

It was pure, animal magnetism. When she was near, his reptilian instincts, so long suppressed by his human upbringing, roared to life. He could smell her before she even entered the room. Every fluid, predatory movement she made drew his eye. He was utterly captivated by her.

They were lying in her sterile, Compact-issued barrack after another brutal, scratch-filled encounter. Otto could feel his nanites already working on the marks her talons had left on his shoulders.

""I have a question,"" he finally asked, breaking the silence. He watched as she nonchalantly cleaned her long nails. ""Are you... with anyone else besides me?""

W’thiara looked at him, genuinely surprised.

""Of course. In our species, females can have many partners, even while having a permanent one. It's biology, Otto.""

She put down the nail tool and smiled predatorily.

""The same applies to you. You can have someone else, too. In my barracks, the others have their eye on you. That 'virgin' status of yours turned out to be very... intriguing.""

Otto shook his head.

""I can't do that. I was raised on Earth, in their culture, practically alone. For me, monogamy is normal. I want to ask you... would you like to try? Just with me?""

W’thiara studied him for a moment, as if analyzing a new, surprising data set. His request, from her perspective as someone raised by the Compact, was absurd. Almost childish. To limit biological options because of a human concept called ""exclusivity""? And yet, this male was different. His strange, human mind trapped in a powerful, reptilian body... his suppressed instinct that exploded around her... it was fascinating.

""An interesting experiment,"" she murmured finally, a note of scientific curiosity in her voice. ""It costs nothing. I agree.""

Otto felt a wave of relief so strong it almost made him dizzy. She agreed. Maybe she didn't understand it the way he did, but she agreed. Emboldened, he went a step further.

""And I want you to come to my place. To my apartment in downtown Berlin. Can you?""

W’thiara's smile became more practical. She reminded him of the reality they lived in.

""I'm not a tourist, Otto. I am under the jurisdiction of the Compact. If I get permission to leave the zone and stay overnight, I'll let you know. If I can get it.""

W’thiara got the permit. When her air transport settled on the landing pad in central Berlin, she felt like she had landed on a different planet. Berlin of the future was a marvel of engineering and chaos. Giant, glass buildings climbed towards the sky, and between them, on various levels, thousands of silent, flying vehicles zipped past. The street level was surprisingly human—full of pedestrians, greenery, and dozens of eateries from which aromas from all over the world wafted.

She stood for a moment, taking in the view. It was her first time here; leaving the Compact zone was a rarity. She saw laughing people sitting in café gardens. But she also saw the ubiquitous Guard propaganda. Giant holograms of Admiral Thorne looked down on the city with a stern, fatherly expression, and the Guard logo adorned nearly every other building.

""Come on, you'll have Chinese,"" Otto pulled her hand towards a small, unassuming joint. ""I like this place.""

The interior was small and loud. The owner, an older Asian man, greeted them, smiling broadly at Otto from behind the bar.

""The usual, boss?""

""Yes, two sweet and sour chickens with rice, please. Spicy.""

W’thiara ate, her eyes widening with every bite. The flame of the hot spices exploded in her mouth.

""This is fucking good... Spicy,"" she rasped, reaching for water. ""We don't have meals like this in the Compact. Ours are more averaged, balanced.""

""I know,"" Otto smiled, already finishing his portion. ""I've eaten your rations.""

He paid, and then they walked to his nearby apartment. As they entered the elevator, a neighbor with a dog greeted him. At the sight of Otto, the dog yelped with joy and threw itself at him in a friendly greeting, trying to lick his legs.

W’thiara instinctively took a step back.

""A dog. Don't be afraid,"" Otto laughed, scratching the animal behind the ears. ""It's an animal. Humans keep them in their homes.""

""What for?"" she asked, her analytical mind unable to process the concept. It was not a food source or a combat unit.

Otto petted the dog, and it licked his claws in response.

""For pleasure.""

W’thiara laughed, fearlessly taking a healthy swig from the unmarked bottle Otto handed her. It was moonshine, specially prepared for him by a human moonshiner he had met back in the Guard. The concoction was 80% alcohol. Something that would be a terrible, even lethal dose for a human, was simply... pleasantly warming for her reptilian physiology.

She laughed, her throaty voice filling the apartment. Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

Otto opened it. In the doorway stood Lyra and Jimmy, both clearly drunk, holding a bottle of something that looked equally suspicious.

""Hey! What are you guys doing here? You didn't call, nothing..."" Otto was genuinely surprised.

""Ah, we saw you in town, walking to your place!"" Lyra waved her hand, walking inside uninvited, with Jimmy right behind her. ""By chance. So we're crashing your party like jerks. Hope you have something to drink!""

Otto laughed heartily.

""Good to see you. W’thiara, this is Jimmy and Lyra. My best friends. Guards, like me."" He looked at them with a warmth he rarely showed. ""They were the first to treat me as one of their own. Like a human."" He turned back to W’thiara. ""Which must have been hard for them. They fought our kind on Proxima b.""

W’thiara approached and offered them her hand. She already knew this human gesture.

""Nice to meet you.""

The evening quickly picked up speed. The moonshine flowed. It was full of alcohol, memories, and stories. Otto, feeling at ease among his closest friends, told W’thiara about his sparring matches with Jimmy.

""This one here,"" he pointed at Jimmy, who was currently trying to explain the rules of poker to W’thiara, ""tried to beat the crap out of me three times in a row. And you know what the best part is? I was unarmored, and he was testing the latest Hoplite 4.0 armor prototype on me! And he still couldn't win!""

Jimmy just smiled his typical, ironic smirk.

Otto also spoke about K’tharr. About how powerful that warrior had been.

""I couldn't do anything against him, despite all my training. Despite all the sparring and drills. He was just... better.""

W’thiara suddenly grew serious, setting her glass down.

""K’tharr?"" She knew the name. ""Yes, we know him. He's one of their oldest fleet commanders. He started from the lowest rank, was just a warrior. From what we know from Compact intelligence data, he's had about 200 incarnations, not counting transfers to other regions. Which means, with our natural lifespan, about or even over two thousand of your years of experience.""

Otto stared at her, astonished.

""You didn't stand a chance,"" W’thiara smiled and affectionately scratched him lightly on the arm with a claw, almost the same way he had petted the dog earlier.

Meanwhile, Lyra and Jimmy, completely drunk and uninterested in strategic conversations about ancient reptiles, were making out on the couch, paying no attention to their hosts. Their whispers mingled with giggles. Jimmy's hand wandered under Lyra's shirt, and she, instead of stopping him, pulled him closer, kissing him hard and wetly on the neck. Their affections became less and less subtle, and the sounds of smacking kisses and quiet moans began to mix with Otto's stories.

Otto and W’thiara looked at each other with amusement.

An hour later, Jimmy and Lyra were fast asleep on the couch in a tight, drunken embrace.

In the morning, they were awakened not by an alarm, but by a loud sizzling sound coming from the kitchen. Jimmy was the first one up. While the rest were sleeping soundly after the rough night, he, like a true veteran, had switched to combat mode—fighting the hangover. He was bustling around Otto's kitchen, making breakfast.

Otto was the second to get up. His reptilian physiology handled alcohol much better than a human's, but he still felt a slight buzzing in his head. A moment later, W’thiara woke up, stretching with a grace that seemed completely at odds with last night's intoxication.

The last to wake, with a loud groan, was Lyra. She dragged herself off the couch, almost naked—last night's party must have had a hot finale, as she was sleeping only in her underwear. She grabbed her head, muttering something under her breath about dying.

""Scrambled eggs with butter!"" Jimmy announced joyfully from the kitchen, entering the living room with a steaming pan. ""Lots of fat, it'll get us back on our feet. Plus bacon and fresh bread.""

W’thiara, who was observing the human morning rituals with curiosity, tried the scrambled eggs. Her eyes widened slightly.

""A very good dish,"" she said to Otto, taking another forkful.

""They're eggs,"" Otto explained. ""Just from chickens, birds, but the kind that can't fly.""

""And the bacon?"" she asked, pointing to a crispy strip.

""A type of meat. Fatty, but tasty. Thin slices.""

The morning was pleasant. The greasy breakfast and strong coffee got even Lyra on her feet, who looked human again after a shower. The atmosphere was relaxed, full of laughter about the previous evening.

""The party's moving to our place!"" Lyra declared as soon as she felt better.

They took a flying taxi to their apartment on the other side of Berlin. There, the fun continued. They drank lighter alcohols, listened to music, and W’thiara, who was experiencing such a casual, human social gathering for the first time, laughed genuinely.

""You people really like to party. To have fun.""

""It's our nature,"" Otto shrugged. ""It's how we are.""

In the evening, still in the same group, they went out for sushi.

""It's raw fish in rice,"" Otto explained to W’thiara as she examined a piece of nigiri with analytical precision. ""Don't worry, it's fully compatible with our physiology. I checked. But the best part is the sake. Japanese vodka. It's weak, you drink it warm.""

W’thiara tasted, played, drank. For her, a being raised by the logical Compact, this day was pure, chaotic relaxation.

And so the days, weeks, and years passed.

Otto's life found a rhythm it had never known. His job as a Guard instructor, while still demanding, became routine. Real life began after hours. His relationship with W’thiara, which had begun with primal, animal magnetism and brutal sex, slowly evolved. The ""monogamy experiment,"" as W’thiara had initially called their exclusivity, unexpectedly became her preferred state. She discovered that the human concept of partnership gave her a sense of stability that her fleeting, instinctive encounters in the Compact barracks had not.

After five years of a monogamous relationship, in 2190, they decided on an Earth wedding. It was more of a gesture by Otto towards the culture he was raised in than a necessity, but W’thiara agreed with analytical curiosity. The ceremony was quiet, just for their closest friends—Lyra, Jimmy, and a few friends from the Guard.

The biggest change, however, was offspring. Otto had wanted those children from the moment he learned they were possible. The Guard and Compact procedures for interspecies reproduction, however, were a bureaucratic nightmare. The matter was at a standstill until Otto, in an act of desperation, asked for help from the one person in the Guard who understood him without words.

Their three children were conceived only after Colonel Kent personally intervened. Kent, with his hero's authority, contacts, and directness, cut through the tangle of regulations and got them the permit. W’thiara carried the eggs, and Otto, with devout reverence, kept them in an incubator for three months, watching as his three young hatched.

Their life became a happy, loud chaos. They ran a home, raised their children, argued about little things, and enjoyed every day together. They didn't know their idyllic life would come to an end. They didn't know that in just over ten years, in 2202, the peace treaty with the Plague would expire.

1oqvolj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1oqvolj/i_feel_like_we_live_in_a_zombie_apocalypse_just/,"I feel like we live in a zombie apocalypse, just that the zombies are really inactive","Its scary the amount of posts i see on this subreddit that involves students talking about how they are so lonely and lack friends.

I’m finishing heading university next year, and honestly, I’m scared college might just be more screens and less people.

I get that everyone has their own lifestyle, but honestly, that shouldn’t be an excuse to not have fun or make real connections. It feels like tech has rewired how we interact. Everything’s instant, yet somehow… empty.

I have a decent friend group in high school, but if one of us stopped talking tomorrow, I don’t think anyone would really notice. We’ve spent years together, but the bonds feel paper-thin — like we all care, but not enough.

It’s weird how deep friendships have become optional now, like no one wants to risk caring too much. And I know tech is the hidden culprit of this all. Everyone just has to act like an ass to give the ""too cool to care"" vibe, phones just make it easier, when in reallity everyone who acts as if their having fun is actually living in their own pathetic digital bubbles.



Anyway, I asked ChatGPT to show me what college life used to be like vs how it is now, and it came up with two very different worlds.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, here’s a snapshot of a modern university social day — curated, hybrid, and slightly obsessive with notifications:



8:00 AM – The slow scroll wake-up

You wake up with 20 notifications, 5 group chats buzzing, and 2 professors emailing about assignment deadlines. Snooze. Check TikTok for “morning motivation.” You actually get out of bed 30 minutes later because your Zoom class starts soon.

9:00 AM – The hybrid class shuffle

You log into Zoom, but half the people are on campus. Some classmates are physically present, others are avatars in a tiny video window. Chat’s blowing up with side memes while the professor talks about linear algebra. You answer “good morning” in the chat instead of actually talking.

11:00 AM – Micro-meetups

Between classes, you meet a friend for coffee. It’s not spontaneous — it was scheduled in your WhatsApp group 2 days ago. You discuss a project, scroll Instagram at the same time, and split after 20 minutes. Half of your floormates are also online gaming, streaming, or on Discord calls.

1:00 PM – Lunch + online overlap

You sit with a small table of friends. Everyone’s eating, but almost everyone’s also on a device — checking TikTok, posting a story, coordinating a group chat. Conversation jumps from politics to memes to AI tools. It’s chaotic in content, but physically calm.

3:00 PM – Club/interest meetup

You attend a club meeting — part in-person, part Zoom. Some people are muted, some forget their cameras on. Decisions are made via Slack poll. Still, you bond over shared hobbies, but there’s a constant “someone’s missing online” feeling.

5:00 PM – Solo or semi-social activities

You hit the gym, walk outside, or study. Occasionally, you bump into someone and have a brief in-person chat. No long unplanned hangouts; everything is small, intentional. Notifications buzz — some friends are online, some are not.

7:00 PM – “Friends night”

You meet a tight circle for dinner or a mini-gathering. People film a TikTok or record Reels. Conversation includes assignments, memes, side projects, and existential rants. Everyone is tired but posting for social proof anyway.

10:00 PM – Late-night wind-down

Some people call it “gaming night,” others scroll TikTok or chat in Discord. Deep talks happen online more than in person. People might be sitting in the same dorm room physically but interacting via phones.

1:00 AM – Solo reflection

You finally go to bed, scrolling a little more, setting reminders for tomorrow, and feeling simultaneously connected and isolated. Social life happened, but it was planned, mediated, and partly digital.

\-------------------------------------------------------

Alright, picture this — early 2000s or late ’90s campus life, no smartphones, no social media, just raw human chaos:



8:00 AM – The accidental wake-up call

Someone in your dorm blasts music way too early — probably Blink-182 or Eminem — and now half the floor’s awake. You curse them, but end up yelling song lyrics down the hallway five minutes later.

9:00 AM – The “I’ll just grab coffee” detour

You head to the cafeteria for a quick coffee before class. You never make it to class. A group of friends drags you into a debate about which professor’s worse, and you somehow end up planning a “protest” that’s really just an excuse to skip a lecture.

11:00 AM – Random adventure time

Someone’s got an old car with no gas and big dreams. The crew decides a road trip to the next town is necessary. No Google Maps — just a printed map that no one knows how to read. You get lost, find a weird diner, and laugh until your stomach hurts.

2:00 PM – Back to campus chaos

You return late, covered in dust and fries, crash into a random lecture pretending you’ve been there all along. The professor knows you’re lying but doesn’t care.

4:00 PM – Dorm social hurricane

Hallways are packed. People are yelling about soccer, music, and conspiracy theories. Someone’s playing guitar badly. Someone else is cooking instant noodles in a kettle. The entire floor smells like caffeine and questionable decisions.

7:00 PM – The “group study” session that isn’t

Books are open. No one’s reading them. Someone starts doodling on a whiteboard, another puts on a movie “for background noise,” and soon half the room’s playing cards while pretending it’s still academic.

10:00 PM – Unplanned party

Someone says, “Let’s just chill.” Fifteen minutes later, it’s a full-blown party with music from actual CDs, strobe lights made from desk lamps, and someone screaming that the RA’s coming. Half the dorm hides in one room; the other half pretends to be asleep.

2:00 AM – Deep talk o’clock

When the noise dies, you’re on the stairs with two friends, talking about life, love, and how you’re all gonna “change the world.” Someone’s crying. Someone’s asleep mid-sentence. The vending machine eats your last dollar.

3:00 AM – Collapse

No alarms, no screen glow — just the sound of a hallway fan, laughter echoing down the corridor, and the realization that you’ve got class in five hours and don’t even care.

\---------------------------------------------------

Im not sure about you guys, but the second one hit me like a train. The amount of chaos and deep emotions involved just feels like uncontrollable fun.

I am pretty sure the second scenario feels like the day-to-day dream university life, but is anyone actually living up to it anymore?

What do you guys think? Feel free to go an emotional let out

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Dender vs. Zulte-Waregem: A Desperate Dance in the Relegation Zone**

Let’s cut to the chase: This match is less of a football game and more of a *Desperate Housewives* spin-off, where Dender is the neighbor who’s *finally* going to host a killer BBQ (a win) after three years of burnt waffles and awkward silence. The odds? A tight cluster of decimal decimals that make you question if your coffee’s even awake. Let’s parse this mess.

### Odds: A Tug-of-War Between Desperation and Competence

The bookmakers are playing coy. Dender sits at **2.45-2.50** (implied probability: \~40%), Zulte-Waregem at **2.69-2.75** (\~37%), and the draw at **3.40-3.60** (\~28-29%). Translated: The market thinks Dender has a slight edge at home, but Zulte’s better form keeps them in the conversation. The over/under 2.5 goals line hovers around **1.76-1.80** (57-58% for over), suggesting bookies expect a spicy, goal-filled spectacle.

### News: Dender’s “Almost” Barcelona Feat and Zulte’s Quiet Confidence

Dender’s recent near-miss against… *wait, FC Barcelona?* Let’s pause. Yes, the article claims Dender “was on the verge of a draw against FC Barcelona at Jan Breydel Stadium.” If this is true, Dender’s stadium should be renamed *Camp Nou Nord*. Alas, they fell short, but now they’re motivated like a student who almost aced a pop quiz but had to rewrite it. David Toshevski, their North Macedonian savior, is confidently vowing victory—probably while sipping a Belgian beer and eyeing the bench.

Zulte-Waregem, meanwhile, isn’t throwing confetti, but they’re the functional adult in the room. They’ve got better form, no major injury drama (

I wanna share my solo trip to **Yunnan, China**. 

I still remember that day when I arrived in Kunming, the so-called *“City of Eternal Spring.”* The air felt soft and a little warm, with that faint chill that sneaks in after sunset.

[On the way to Kunming](https://preview.redd.it/9z3rb4raduzf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2ef5e441c280852445d911ac647a4ff2b32d67b)

I dropped my bag at a not-so-great hotel and went out hunting for food. Ended up at a small local spot called Juan'er Rice Noodles (卷尔小锅米线) - one of those unassuming places that locals love. For about 2 dollars, I got a steaming bowl of noodles with fried tofu and stinky tofu (a traditional combo here). It was simple, cheap, and ridiculously good.

That afternoon, I wandered through the Yunnan Provincial Museum. The special exhibit I wanted to see had just ended, but I didn't mind. The rest of the museum was beautiful - from ancient bronze relics to Tang-Song Buddhist art and local ethnic displays. It felt like the perfect quiet start to know Yunnan's culture.

[The museum](https://preview.redd.it/i49a799dduzf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db1072db2b233aeb2e935f3e2fbe05da8abf686f)

On the second day, I went to the Cuihu Park, basically a local park where families come to walk around and relax. It was early, around 9 a.m., and the park was already full of locals exercising, dancing, and feeding seagulls. The vibe was super calm — one of those places where you just slow down and watch life happen.

After that, I walked to Yunnan University, which is right nearby. Honestly, the campus was beautiful — full of trees, old buildings, and flowers everywhere. I spent about an hour just wandering around and taking photos.

For lunch, I tried another small noodle shop near the campus (Yunnan is really all about rice noodles 😅). Later, I grabbed a coffee at Juan’er Café, sat near the window, and just enjoyed the slow afternoon.

Around 2 p.m., I headed to the train station and took a high-speed train to Dali. It took about three hours. Pro tip: don’t be like me — I almost missed the train dragging my suitcase through the station.

That’s where my Kunming part ended — next stop, Dali.  
I’ll share that trip later :)

No matter how many hours I sleep, when I wake up and see the sun out, I feel so sleepy or tired. My energy is always super low during the day. I just want to chill, relax, or even nap. But when night comes..  even if I haven’t slept for 24 hours.. I suddenly get this rush of energy. I feel alive, active, motivated, and I don’t even know why.

I think it started a few years ago when I had about three years of working and studying during the night. My whole lifestyle was built around the night, and I loved it. But this year, I’ve been forced to live a “normal” schedule.. awake during the day.. and I’m really struggling.

I’ve tried to fix my sleep routine going to bed early, sleeping 6–7 hours, staying consistent for weeks… but it doesn’t seem to help. After two or three hours of being awake, I already feel tired again.

I even did full blood tests.. everything came back normal except for a slight vitamin D3 deficiency, which is common where I live. I’ve been taking vitamin D supplements for six months, but nothing’s changed.

I also tried drinking coffee 3–4 hours after waking up, but still.. I feel mentally tired during the day. Physically I can work and function, but my brain just feels like it wants to sleep.

Has anyone else experienced this? What could be the reason? Is it purely psychological or something deeper with circadian rhythm or hormones? I’d really love to hear your thoughts or if anyone managed to fix this.",1,1762525033.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

I’m finishing heading university next year, and honestly, I’m scared college might just be more screens and less people.

I get that everyone has their own lifestyle, but honestly, that shouldn’t be an excuse to not have fun or make real connections. It feels like tech has rewired how we interact. Everything’s instant, yet somehow… empty.

I have a decent friend group in high school, but if one of us stopped talking tomorrow, I don’t think anyone would really notice. We’ve spent years together, but the bonds feel paper-thin — like we all care, but not enough.

It’s weird how deep friendships have become optional now, like no one wants to risk caring too much. And I know tech is the hidden culprit of this all. Everyone just has to act like an ass to give the ""too cool to care"" vibe, phones just make it easier, when in reality everyone who acts as if their having fun is actually living in their own pathetic digital bubbles.



Anyway, I asked ChatGPT to show me what college life used to be like vs how it is now, and it came up with two very different worlds.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, here’s a snapshot of a modern university social day — curated, hybrid, and slightly obsessive with notifications:



8:00 AM – The slow scroll wake-up

You wake up with 20 notifications, 5 group chats buzzing, and 2 professors emailing about assignment deadlines. Snooze. Check TikTok for “morning motivation.” You actually get out of bed 30 minutes later because your Zoom class starts soon.

9:00 AM – The hybrid class shuffle

You log into Zoom, but half the people are on campus. Some classmates are physically present, others are avatars in a tiny video window. Chat’s blowing up with side memes while the professor talks about linear algebra. You answer “good morning” in the chat instead of actually talking.

11:00 AM – Micro-meetups

Between classes, you meet a friend for coffee. It’s not spontaneous — it was scheduled in your WhatsApp group 2 days ago. You discuss a project, scroll Instagram at the same time, and split after 20 minutes. Half of your floormates are also online gaming, streaming, or on Discord calls.

1:00 PM – Lunch + online overlap

You sit with a small table of friends. Everyone’s eating, but almost everyone’s also on a device — checking TikTok, posting a story, coordinating a group chat. Conversation jumps from politics to memes to AI tools. It’s chaotic in content, but physically calm.

3:00 PM – Club/interest meetup

You attend a club meeting — part in-person, part Zoom. Some people are muted, some forget their cameras on. Decisions are made via Slack poll. Still, you bond over shared hobbies, but there’s a constant “someone’s missing online” feeling.

5:00 PM – Solo or semi-social activities

You hit the gym, walk outside, or study. Occasionally, you bump into someone and have a brief in-person chat. No long unplanned hangouts; everything is small, intentional. Notifications buzz — some friends are online, some are not.

7:00 PM – “Friends night”

You meet a tight circle for dinner or a mini-gathering. People film a TikTok or record Reels. Conversation includes assignments, memes, side projects, and existential rants. Everyone is tired but posting for social proof anyway.

10:00 PM – Late-night wind-down

Some people call it “gaming night,” others scroll TikTok or chat in Discord. Deep talks happen online more than in person. People might be sitting in the same dorm room physically but interacting via phones.

1:00 AM – Solo reflection

You finally go to bed, scrolling a little more, setting reminders for tomorrow, and feeling simultaneously connected and isolated. Social life happened, but it was planned, mediated, and partly digital.

\-------------------------------------------------------

Alright, picture this — early 2000s or late ’90s campus life, no smartphones, no social media, just raw human chaos:



8:00 AM – The accidental wake-up call

Someone in your dorm blasts music way too early — probably Blink-182 or Eminem — and now half the floor’s awake. You curse them, but end up yelling song lyrics down the hallway five minutes later.

9:00 AM – The “I’ll just grab coffee” detour

You head to the cafeteria for a quick coffee before class. You never make it to class. A group of friends drags you into a debate about which professor’s worse, and you somehow end up planning a “protest” that’s really just an excuse to skip a lecture.

11:00 AM – Random adventure time

Someone’s got an old car with no gas and big dreams. The crew decides a road trip to the next town is necessary. No Google Maps — just a printed map that no one knows how to read. You get lost, find a weird diner, and laugh until your stomach hurts.

2:00 PM – Back to campus chaos

You return late, covered in dust and fries, crash into a random lecture pretending you’ve been there all along. The professor knows you’re lying but doesn’t care.

4:00 PM – Dorm social hurricane

Hallways are packed. People are yelling about soccer, music, and conspiracy theories. Someone’s playing guitar badly. Someone else is cooking instant noodles in a kettle. The entire floor smells like caffeine and questionable decisions.

7:00 PM – The “group study” session that isn’t

Books are open. No one’s reading them. Someone starts doodling on a whiteboard, another puts on a movie “for background noise,” and soon half the room’s playing cards while pretending it’s still academic.

10:00 PM – Unplanned party

Someone says, “Let’s just chill.” Fifteen minutes later, it’s a full-blown party with music from actual CDs, strobe lights made from desk lamps, and someone screaming that the RA’s coming. Half the dorm hides in one room; the other half pretends to be asleep.

2:00 AM – Deep talk o’clock

When the noise dies, you’re on the stairs with two friends, talking about life, love, and how you’re all gonna “change the world.” Someone’s crying. Someone’s asleep mid-sentence. The vending machine eats your last dollar.

3:00 AM – Collapse

No alarms, no screen glow — just the sound of a hallway fan, laughter echoing down the corridor, and the realization that you’ve got class in five hours and don’t even care.

\---------------------------------------------------

Im not sure about you guys, but the second one hit me like a train. The amount of chaos and deep emotions involved just feels like uncontrollable fun.

I am pretty sure the second scenario feels like the day-to-day dream university life, but is anyone actually living up to it anymore?
