I Exposed Her Lie 3 Years Later in Front of the Whole Family","I’m 31F. Three years ago, my mother skipped my *medical school graduation* after promising she'd come.  
A week before, my younger sister Maya got pregnant and had morning sickness. Mom told me she “couldn’t leave the poor girl,” and that I should “understand because I’m the strong one.”

Graduation day, I sat alone while every other student had family cheering.

That afternoon, I opened Facebook.

My mom had posted a photo at **10 AM** — during my ceremony — smiling with Maya in her kitchen, drinking coffee.

Caption: *“Beautiful Sunday with my daughter! #FamilyFirst.”*

She lied. She wasn’t caring for a sick daughter. She just chose the favorite one.

I confronted her. She called me “dramatic.”  
So I went no-contact for three years.

Last month, she got sick and asked Maya to beg me for medical help.  
I agreed to visit *once*.

When I walked into the room, the whole family was there.  
I pulled out my phone and showed that Facebook post.

“This was during my graduation,” I said. “She said she couldn’t come because Maya was sick. She was having coffee.”

Maya looked shocked. My aunt looked disgusted.  
My mom broke down crying.

I told her:  
**“You chose #FamilyFirst. Just not with me.”**  
And I walked out.

Some relatives say I was cruel.  
I think I finally told the truth out loud.

Yes, I know it’s “more affordable” and “hotter” and “there’s no In-N-Out traffic.” Cool.
What I don’t know is the stuff you only learn once you’ve actually lived there — especially if you’re coming from a big, diverse, walkable-ish, public-transit-less-but-still-trying West Coast city.

I’m trying to mentally prep for things like:
	•	culture shock that hits in the first 2 weeks
	•	how different “polite” and “friendly” actually are
	•	what dating looks like when half the bios say “God first” and mean it
	•	the way people talk about weather like it’s a sports rivalry
	•	trying to find a coffee shop that isn’t inside a megachurch
	•	the car dependency level compared to LA (which I didn’t know could get worse)
	•	the moment you realize humidity is just your new roommate
	•	how people somehow drive 95 mph while also being extremely offended that you’re in “their” lane
	•	the suburban sprawl where everything is 20 minutes away even when it’s “close”
	•	the difference between “Southern hospitality” and “I just want to see what you’re about”
	•	how socially normal it is to talk about your job, your house, your church, and your HOA in the first 10 minutes of meeting someone
	•	how people react when you say you don’t eat brisket
	•	how subtle (or not subtle) the LA → Dallas political transition feels in day-to-day life
	•	stuff locals think is totally normal but feels like a side quest if you’re not from Texas

I’m not looking for the political flame-war answers (there are enough of those already).
I’m looking for the real, lived-in insights — the funny, weird, unexpectedly wholesome, unexpectedly confusing realities of going from a blue city where half the population has a reusable water bottle collection… to a city where I’ve heard people casually use the phrase “my gun safe” in small talk.

If you’ve done this move, or you’ve lived in both places, what were the biggest surprises that hit you after the honeymoon phase ended?

What should I expect emotionally and socially, not just financially?

1p4dfef,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4dfef,"The Bamboo Room at Three Dots and a Dash (Chicago, IL)","Made it back to Chicago for the weekend and after a fun but somewhat underwhelming tiki experience last time I visited Three Dots and a Dash, I was excited to have a reservation for the Bamboo Room and boy did it exceed my expectations in some areas but then fall short in others yet again!

The good: I LOVE the quiet more intimate space. The main bar caters so much more to the North Loop drinking crowds that it's more like a glorified yuppie bar with incredible tiki drinks than a classic Tiki vibe. The Bamboo Room however, sticks the landing when it comes to calm, relaxing, and heightened sophistication almost reminiscent of those dark golden-age tiki bars we often hear so much about. The drinks were incredible and made with so much effort and execution that you can taste in every sip. The focus on technique is the highest I've ever experienced in my limited tiki bar adventures, and I'd highly recommend this for any tiki lover looking to expand their horizons on classics in a not-so-gimmicky approach to ""modern"" mixology. There's love and effort put in to the work here.

The not-so-good: The bar seats around 14 and only had 1 bartender and occasionally an additional person on staff to help. When they're full, which is easily often especially closer to and on weekends, service is SLOW. This can be a good thing if you're looking to relax all night and sip at a relaxed pace, though! Also, to nitpick, the only seating available are high tops so even though the vibe is relaxing, the seating is not (especially for these long drinking experiences). My group of 4 had 2 drinks max and we were there for more than 2 hours!

Overall, fantastic drinks, less than fantastic time but at least the vibes were great. I wouldn't blame the staff at all for the paced experience since that's just what it was. I'd wish they'd have at least 1 other bartender on staff per night just to allow more relaxed vibes from the staff, as you can tell having only 1 bartender for 14 made the bar feel extremely backed up immediately in such a calming and beautiful space.

She wanted to know, how general safety is, how safe is to take public transport or neighborhood is, how safe is for women? She tried asking many people , but all answers where based on 'vibes'. Sadly Google reviews is too generic rating on 'how good coffee is' ! 

Here's what I realized you will definitely know which place to go for best experience but not how safe is! No one wants to track this data and many people suffer from this a lot and many of you must have been also facing the same issue.

So I started building a product called **Safe or Not**, it is hyperlocal platform where you can search any location and read other people experience and post yours in seconds. For cherry on top we also added metrics like walkability, street lightning, transport facility  and precautions for free as of now to help you travel better and safer!

But to be honest, I want your support without your reviews or your support my platform is useless. 

Here is the link , for example this is for 'Delhi'- [Safe or Not](https://www.safeornot.space/location/9f573beb-44df-4fd3-a3e5-75b30cf6021e)

You can search for 'Mumbai' or 'Bengaluru' or any location you like!

If you like the concept or product can you please drop a review or signup to support us! It will help literally lot of people to reduce there social anxiety.

Some mornings if I am running late and he has extra time he will take her out. Some weeknights if he is out with a friend or I get home early, I’ll just take her out. On the weekends it’s a little looser and he generally takes her out or we go on a walk together. This weekend morning, I was running late for a class and made him coffee and rushed out the door. He was half asleep so I texted him “coffee is ready, Laney hasn’t been out yet”. My class ran late so I got home a few hours later. He was sitting on the couch not doing anything. I make some lunch for us and start tidying around the house. A few hours go by and he says out loud “the dog needs to go out.” I said “oh! Has she been out yet today?” And he said ”no, remember our agreement?” I explained that I thought that was mostly for the weekdays and most weekends we just both pitch in, that’s why I texted since he didn’t have anything scheduled today. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have just assumed that he would have woken up and taken her out. I should have made sure that she went out before I left Or maybe even explicitly asked if he would take her out. But I see her as a shared responsibility and if I can even if it’s technically “his turn” I just take her out, I don’t wait for him to ask for help if she needs to go. Beyond this situation though, this difference in our thinking and expectations shows up in other areas too.

I don’t want it to wedge more of a divide between us. I love him, he loves me, and I see his dedication to respect and responsibility - but it feels so rigid at times. We talk about having kids and I worry that it will only get worse over time. I’m struggling with two things here: 1) How do I express this to him? In the past when we’ve talked about similar things he has said that he feels loved when we both take care of our roles without asking each other for help and less loved when that’s not fulfilled. I truly don’t want him to feel less loved but I also feel like I don’t want to live in such a rigid household. It’s good to count on each other and to know our roles, but we’re also on the same team and at the end of the day you do what it takes to do the best for the relationship. 2) How do I meet his expectations more while maybe encouraging him to meet me halfway too? I try to not ask for help with housework, etc but it means a lot when he does do something to help like take out the trash, especially since we are both due to the economy, currently working and contributing financially. 

We both lean more towards traditional roles but I appreciate more flexibility when it comes to life and working together - where I feel more and more he has a very black and white rigid approach. How do we meet in the middle?",1,1763871454.0,RedPillWomen,2,1.0,False

PO PO SCOTT

I am a gadget girl, always have been.  Yes, I read the instructions, but I have always been able to fix things with little assistance.

I broke my hip and femur in two places and have been laid up since Dec 1, 2021.  Scott came home to take care of me (not a simple task).  It was hard for him but he does his best.  At first, it drove me nuts, and there was nothing I could do.  Just the sound of someone trying to use a screwdriver and missing multiple times makes me grind my teeth and snatch the tools.

He organizes things, as mentioned before, not by category but by size and where they fit.  Takes me forever to find things after a visit and this one has been over 2 months, so I had to lean in and deal with it. (Xanax helped).

Little things started happening that were “Eh, it’s minor” but something I could have avoided, fixed, or handled.  I started having to call the property management because I couldn’t do anything and Po Po Scott not used to having to deal with these things got frustrated.

First I noticed he turned on the fuse in the garage for the driveway mercury light, which the photosensor does not work so it just stays on.  The fuse has a big gold arrow pointing to it saying “keep off - mercury light”.  He was flipping switches because something blew.  Not reading the panel or looking for the flipped switch.  In turn, this turned off the hot tub.  Now when that goes off you have to turn it back on, set the temp again, filter, and such, it’s not a hard process, but he couldn’t do it and couldn’t remember my instructions. “Get me the book in the box next to it and we can review”  I got out a plain sheet of paper and used crayons in different colors so as to specify what would happen to start it again, I really thought about holding his head underwater, but just briefly (I couldn’t stand that long). The color coding schematic worked!

He thinks the upright Shark vac is a shop vac and couldn’t understand why it wasn’t working, he took off the canisters and cleaned, but still nothing.  He brings it to me, takes off the canister and I say, so what’s that stuck in the hose?  Turns out it was a marker top and blocking the hose.

I have a 99 Cherokee, its old and it’s just sitting there for now while I decide what to do with it, that thing is a workhorse, but I am no longer.  Scott comes to me complaining that the tires are flat and he is positive the neighbors think it is an eyesore. I just looked at him and said, it is insured and legal, so who cares, the compressor is out in the garage if it bothers you that much, do it yourself because obviously, I can’t.  Well, he organized the garage and now can't find the compressor along with the piece that hooks in to inflate the tires (he complained several times and I just kept asking, are your hands broken?)  so I just ordered a new air chuck.  Went to the garage on my walker, took an orange garden flag, and stuck it on the compressor.  Soon enough he complained about the flat tires, I threatened crayon diagrams, then said the compressor has an orange flag sticking up and the chucks are tied to it, again, your arms and legs aren’t broken, please, do it yourself.  He did.

He plugged too many things in near the stove, proceeded to run the garbage disposal, then start the dishwasher, microwave something and preheat the stove.  The microwave blew a fuse and was not working, after he checked the outside fuse box (yes, flipping all, restarting the hot tub) nothing worked, he came to me and said the microwave is busted, you will have to call the property management and have it replaced.  I smiled and said “ok sweetie”  I was in no way telling him about the bigger fuse box in the basement because I couldn’t get there and lord, really only Goddess knows what would happen.  My friend (savior) Gary (plumber/electrician handyman) happen to call to see if he could borrow a ladder, I said I’ll make a deal with you.  Of course, you can borrow a ladder, but could you go downstairs stealthy and flip the fuse for the kitchen?  He chuckled, said sure.  Miraculously the microwave no longer needed replacement!

Boy this is getting long and I’m nowhere near done, but I will finish up as to why I was driven to write this up. . . . . . . . the garage remote.  When Noah moved to South Carolina he accidentally took the garage remote for the main door, I had the one for the second door (which by the way the chain has come off, I’m suspicious).  This became a tinderbox for Scott.  I said “chill, it can be reprogrammed to the main door”  I remembered how to do it but I couldn't get on the small ladder, so I pulled up a youtube as a refresher, went outside with him, and was explaining what to do, he was impatient and kept trying to get ahead of me and do it too quickly.  So it didn’t work, I said, I’ll check the battery and such and you can try again.  Needless to say, it didn’t work for him.

This man is wonderful, he has waited on me hand and foot, learned to use the air fryer, makes me coffee and a muffin every morning and I love him, I think the perks are the crazy parts that make it so fun.

P.S.  many of you know I cant wear anything with a battery . I drain them.  So this was on me, I changed the button battery to the remote - it blinks then dies. I change it again - same result. So I get out my volt tester with leads. So basically I killed every battery and now I have to buy more, and scott can put them in.🤪

> S Tier - They just work

sunny-shroom - it's what makes ramp a problem. 5 and 6 cost cards is kind of the turning point where units either have really strong effects, or are heavily statted. having access to that on turn 3 is insane, especially when the meta outside ramp is a bit slower. this allows slow meta cards but so much sooner, to play a fast game in a slow meta.

astrocado - a very nice midgame finisher. even when not used in midgame it's still a way around board clog zombies can sometimes do late game with their 8 million cards they have in hand. plus, the pit after it dies makes for some real interesting mind games and causes your opponent to slow down and maybe not fully commit and give you some breathing room.

cob cannon - destroys any zombie, makes a strong unit on the board, and gives aoe -1/-1. that's a lot packed into a single card. many times it's worth playing without the evo. a scorched earth that comes bundled with a 4/6 is still good. plus, lil buddy and kernel pult are both really cheap team-ups within the same class so it always has a pairing

lil buddy - another enabler card like sunny shroom, except this guy enables cob cannon and ppmd. 2hp is a nice little chunk and if it isn't fodder for cob, it can be a trade correcter to win even trades.

kernel pult - anti-teacher is a godsend. besides that it's still an amazing early game card leaning into control and late game helps to get things that are just out of range of other removal option for a 1-cost. heavy on utility. despite the heights requirement, you often still want 4 of them unlike cabbagepult.

laser bean - similar to astrocado, but a little more expensive. the damage this guy can output late game or in ramp is very high and can instantly turn games around.

water balloons - -3/-3 is crazy strong. it cripples pretty much any zombie, and even the most heavy raw statted zombies find themselves to be manageable after a single 2-cost card. even early game while this is stil a -2/-2 it's still a good removal card

> A Tier - Just give it a little nudge first

Pepper M.D. - the only thing keeping it from S is it's a little conditional to get it's buff, and it's very resource hungry. i think by design most sources of healing are just from a single effect. the reoccurring healing is usually expensive and hard to consistently get use from. still, ppmd is this high cause +2/+2 is a massive buff that can get out of control with just a couple buffs. with lil buddy, it often is just a 2-cost 4/4. if not taken out, it'll just keep growing in the right decks. i think he shines best in a deck that just uses healing, but doesn't focus hard on it. those are less focused on making ppmd the wincon, and more about making him a nuisance so your actual wincon can do it's job.

ketchup mechanic - an awkward card, as are most cards that rely on opponents units on the board to be effective. though if you have a pepper on the field it's an easy buff for him, and you get a unit on the field applying additional pressure. if you can find the moment, it's both a lifesaver and a big card that can pull attention away from your hero or other wincon you have on the field.

sunnier-shroom - we already talked about ramp and what it does. sunnier is great cause if your oppinent burns through removal on your sunniers, then you can skip sunnier being slow and taking a turn. sunnier is best on turn 1 and slowly loses value the later in the game you play it. instantly having that +2 sun is , 3hp is very healthy keeping it out of range of most 1-costs and bungie which no other raw ramp card can do. plus, it means your turn 4 you have access to 6-costs, and like i said earlier, that's a tipping point of *really* strong cards.

toadstool - ngl, i think many people sleep on this card. this guy on turn 6 still means you get early access to your 8's. dmd, and wnb on turn 7 is still really strong. though, i think it's best used as a mid-ramp. a sunnier-shroom on turn 3 gets you this on turn 4, which gets you your 8's on turn 5. it's also fairly consistent cause his ability will kill just about any zombie played in front of sunnier, even if they are grave, and still allow 8's on 5. plus, removal that's not dependant on another card to be played like cob or eye spore is really strong. it also means that he loves debuffs on zombies, which is something solar uses in general. a late game w.balloons into toad can be lethal, and because you are already often using w.balloons, he gets to fit right in without feeling like you are running a card to allow another card to work, like kernel and cob can feel sometimes with each other.

elderberry - it's a weaker astrocado. though, he comew with a suprise factor with his evo. a lane that the zombie player thought wasn't lethal cause they chump blocked whatever you had there is all of a sudden lethal again. the evo might be a condition, but it also allows it a versatility that astro doesn't have, which is being played in lanes with non-team-up plants in them.

whack a zombie - simple early to mid game removal. not much to say here. it does exactly what it says, and there are plenty of strong zombies with high hp that just die to this ezpz.

eye spore - killing zombies without the need for a trick. though, this is resource hungry. it's often two cards for one zombie and it's rare for that to wholly be in your favor. of course, whatever you play on it still lives so it's not the most awful trade.

2nd best taco - another card that just does what it says like whack. though, it's nice that this works on other plants too. unit healing is a little more rare than hero healing and sometimes that's the better play. plus, it cycling itself is nice. though, i can see this being a little slow to play if you don't have a controlled board, but solar controls so it shouldn't be that hard get.

> B Tier - needs a bit of a shove

twin sunflower - being a 2-cost with 2hp is rough. you die to almost all early removal except nibble, most 1-costs have 2atk and even the zombies that dont put you on a 1-turn timer to figure out how to keep this alive. it's not terrible though, solar has the tools to do it, but it does take sunnier shroom and make it a little more difficult to stay alive. but it does offer 5-costs on turn 3 which sunnier doesnt do. i still prefer the consistency sunnier gives over the potential this has.

lawnmower - simple and straightforward. not much to say. a slight condition for a cheaper squash essentially.

cross-pollination - this is kind of like reverse ramp. gives you cards that are cheaper than normal. it significantly dampens the 3-cost attachment, even though it's very similar to flourish, and it conjures which is usually worse, i find that the cost reduction makes this much more playable than flourish. might be ranked a little too high though.

briar rose - a bit of a weird card to make it work. i think it's best use is just quick removal and don't count on it to survive for multiple turns. i think what keeps this low is that flowers are overall kind of mid and making an entire deck with only flowers isn't great. there are some great flowers in the game, but it's a small amount compared to how many of them are just okay. if flowers were better this would move up more. still, it gives zombies a taste of their own medicine by functionally giving plants deadly. i do think it was very funny to see zombies constantly complain about her in the early days, as if deadly isn't equally as annoying.

magnifying grass - it's got a niche as an otk with chompzilla and espresso. outside of that, this'll usually die or trade with how low it's hp is. it's not really worth playing midgame cause what are you gonna do with a 3/2 or 4/2 that doesn't do anything else? it's either going for lethal, or burning a hole in your hand as you stall for it to be lethal. it does do it's job well though, and if yu have a ton of sun, it's easy to use that clear a lane where this can hit face without needing to rely on strikethrough like the other finishers do, but that also means teleport shuts this down if you dont have bonus attacks.

tactical cuke - it's a card that really only works in a deck that you know what you are doing with it. there's some light synergy as kernelpult wants heights, so you usually end up playing cob cannon on heights, and that means you've got a decent unit not on the ground. doesn't always work that way though. against some high tempo stuff, especially if going viral is in it, it can kinda shut that down and leave your opponent with a bunch of going virals in hand cycling.

cosmoss - solar has bad envi's so you are really relying on the other class's envi's to help him. it can be really strong but it relies on the card type both sides have the least amount of in their deck. not only that, but plant envi's are generally bad so even if you try to have a cool deck that's all about them, they frequemtly do very little or just end up covered before you get use of them. sf can easily get moss to 4/4 on turn 1 with hot lava which is decently strong, like a better mini ninja.

jack o' lantern - on it's own, it's not doing much. but if you give him some hp, he can become a bit of a menace cause of the scaling strikethrough. great use for removal bait, or even just trading. i should use him more.

apple saucer - he's just 2-cost 3 damage, except he dies to nibble. not great, but if you need to chunck something early he can do it. not a total waste of a card late game as he might be able to get the last little chip damage the zombie hero needs.

three-headed chomper - this is kind of a preemptive placement. i dont think i've ever added this to a deck. flytrap is a pointless tiny tribe, and it being premium means it's rarely getting conjured by most common conjures. i think the end of turn effect sounds strong but ends up fairly weak in practice. most things that are threats you want to block or kill outright, you only really leave weak things to do whatever. that means most of the things this kills are weak mobs you dont perceive as a threat. the benefit to killing things nextdoor is you dont have to spend anything on them, but it's only after combat, which means if you don't spend anything, then you get hit in the face before you actaully benefit. if you chump block, then you're spending something that still has to die in order to get the benefit. it just doesn't work *that* well, especially when things like winter melon and dmd exist that actively kill the zombies nextdoor and prevents them from attacking, which also protects the lane to their right. maybe this should come down to like C, now that i really think about it.

sunflower - everything i said abut twin sunflower except now it dies to literally every zombie except egg. even nibble kills this. it's good removal bait, but even in a budget ramp in early ranks she's not doing much. she's still ramp tho, so she isn't terrible, and team-up along with being 1-cost gives her some utility when her ramp isn't needed as a blocker or cob cannon fuel.

primal sunflower - might be surprising to be below sunflower. i just value the utility of team-up more than i value the 2 damage. hitting face means next to nothing and if a zombie is fronting, she's gonna die. at least normal sunflower can have something played in front. this is also a useless draw in late game when ramp is pointless, unless you're running elder berry or briar rose, which don't make it into solar decks as often as cob cannon does.

wingnut - usage definitely tanked when qb got fixed. though i still think it's a pretty good card. 3atk is a perfect point to avoid rocket and common hearty removal. 7hp is a massive pool. prevent bonus attacks is decently strong too. frenzy is really good on zombie, and i'm also surprised i dont see lurch for lunch more often, but if feels nice to actually be able to chump block some frenzy unlike the usual feeling of just wasting a card. good, but not very important.

> C Tier - you gotta try really hard

mixed nuts - another card i dont recall ever using. on paper, a 2-cost 4/4 seems really strong, i mean ppmd gets to sit in S large part due to it's synergy with lil buddy, but that's all this does. ppmd gets to threaten future developing, while mixed nuts has exhausted all of it's self-developement. late game you have less and less team-up as you burn them for cob or use them for defense, this is becomes more of a dead draw, while ppmd can look for other heal options to still be able to grow and be a menace.

morning glory - it's a slow af card. you mean to tell me i gotta hold this one cost in my hand until i either ramp to 6 sun, or wait until turn 6 for this to be effective? i'd rather just play a 6-cost card at that point. it's a decent low ladder budget flower, but outside of that niche i don't think this is doing much other than being brair fuel, but i could do that with a more functional card than this. it's ability at least makes it less of a dead draw in late game, so i can't be too mad at it. i'd rather draw this than primal sunflower on turn 9.

aloesaurus - fun card to get going with ppmd, but man is that inconsistent. it takes a lot of work and luck to get to that synergy to work and when it does work, it's overkill as hell. funny to have a 32/32 ppmd, but extremely overkill, this isn't the ohio mod. outside of that, it's ability is middling healing at best, but it does help units, which isn't common and i find it surprising when it fixes trades i anticipated to lose or go even over 2 turns. it's also relatively slow, solar has bad draw, as do plants as a whole so getting it's ability to proc consistently takes a tailored deck to do or just rare to happen. in a tailored deck, the whole deck is probably under performing though.

power flower - i've tried to get this card to work well and i just can't get it. you need your board filled with a tribe i find to be mostly mid, and this to not die just so you can heal 4 to 8 hp in a turn? even if you do pull it off, it's not like this is killing much including the hero. 3 damage is middling, other flowers are also middling in damage. at that point it's a 4-cost 3/5 strikethrough that heals 1 hp at the start of turn, and when used like that, it's not terrible. not great though.

fume-shroom - it's okay. the 2 chip damage can build up if you have a deck around strikethrough, but it's just kinda there. it exists, and it doesnt do much besides that.

heartichoke - maybe put this above fume and power in hIndsight. it's ability can clutch games, and given flytrap planet it can cycle the zombie hero to death if you have enough damage taken to your hero. i think this directly scales with how good heal is and i think in this meta heal isnt that great. annoying, but not great. though, when this pops off it's really cool and feels super strong, it's just expensive and hard to get to that point, and definitely not a wincon you should rely on in any way

venus flytrap - a 3-cost with 1hp can and will die very often and that loss in tempo sucks. i guess it's 3-cost heal 3, but i find that to be expensive, i mean lil buddy is a 0-cost heal 2 and both take a card slot. this doesn't have the same amount of utility being team-up either.

squash - it's expensive and slow. it's exact unconditional removal which can be needed, but if you have a good amount of other removal options that may be conditional, but cover each others missing conditions you kinda don't need this.

venus flytrap planet - it's expensive again. even in a ramp deck this is using a lot of the ramp for something that doesn't do anything now, and you're option to play this and something cheaper at the same time when you could've just played a bigger card that does more. in almost all scenarios i'd think i'd rather just play a unit, or something that does something *now* instead of this. though if you can get this off, it kinda just does a lot. if it had it's old version it'd probably be too strong like it was back then.

bloomerang - it's just an objectively worse power flower, and that card isn't even that good.

metal petal sunflower - it's imo an objectively worse toadstool. it fills the niche as a mid-ramp card, but it's significantly less threatening. maybe if it had armor - 1, to increase it's survivability that'd be cool. as is, it's a 4-cost that has middling stats and i'd rather have toad.

cosmic flower - 3-cost 2/2 is awful. the conjure is kinda nice though, since strikethrough is a pretty good trait to have and most flowers in the game do atk so the added trait isn't wasted. though, it's still a flower and like i've said before, a lot of them are pretty mid with a couple of great ones. most of what you get is just gonna be okay, and i dont think there are that many flower synergies to utilize the conjure with. you pretty much got briar and power and only one of those is actually worth using.

sage sage - another ""ramp incentive"" card that feels bad to play cause if it's early it's not really worth it, but late it feels bad for poor stats. i guess it's a card draw, but it's a 2/1 in a lane as late as turn 6. it's practically clogging your lanes and is the block meter and the singular card really worth it? what is the point of this? some niche leafy synergy on chompzilla?

astrovera - lol big hp funny. in reality 8-cost for 5/5 is terrible stats, and that late in the game 10hp is nothing. even ramping to this is bad. like you get a 5/5 as early as... turn 5, maybe 4? that's just on curve stats. you needed to ramp in order to make this card *playable* you also could've just played wnb, dmd, kernel corn, or espresso and made major progression towards winning the gane instead of just delaying your opponents win. this should never make it into anything other meme decks to get 50hp.

solar winds - it's a ramp envi and ramp is op, right? well 3-cost envi just to get a sunflower. at least it's at the end of turn so you can get the +1 sun immediately, but it's still weak and if you aren't actively ramping to something in hand, then this can clog a lane if the zombies just decide to not deal with the sunflowers. hope you get a cob cannon. in all honestly, i think you should be using envi's from the other class of your hero. bog, coffee ground, pearadise, spikeweed sector and force field are all better than both of solar's envi's.

> D-Tier - don't even try

haunted pumpking - the fall from grace. after the december changes the game really slowed down to not allow him to really be worth it. doesn't help that solar isn't a great for aggro in it's own. plus the monster for the zombie just exacebates the card deficit plants are always at. doesn't help that monster is a tribe stacked with good cards that will come back to bite you.

sunflower seed - if you need the ramp from this, it's really slow. if you don't need the ramp it's at best rose fodder. maybe some *really* niche setups with like laser cattail, but imo rose isn't a great amphib user and you might as well just play citron or beta if you want that, both have access to pear cub which fills that niche so much better.

chomper - it's 4-cost 2/3. very expensive for an okay effect. again, just like metal petal, i'd rather just run toad. a little more cost, but stronger effect and it ramps for my 8-costs. these stats are bad for turn 4 and i just can't see the 2 damage really being a threat. it's a removal that clogs your own lanes. also shrinking violet exists as an aoe version of this for the same cost. sure, it's 2atk instead if 3, but still it'll kill them, and if it doesn't it'll weaken them which is still useful.

smahsing pumpkin - it doesn't do anything. like sure, it's a big body with good stats, but there are so many cards with that cost that are not only big bodies, but also have a beneficial effect along with them. this is borderline useless.",3,1763870977.0,PvZHeroes,1,1.0,False

\---

Hybrid name: Azura
Scientific name: Stultusiocosus exinferno
Lab Code Name: 57017051030505:3414473940 (“The Idiot smacker from hell"")

 Gene Contributors:

T. rex : Base body, skull structure, front teeth, predator instincts aka angery

Alxasaurus: Long claws for slashing and defense, don't mess with her claws

Shantungosaurus: Massive size and walking style

Acrocanthosaurus: Neural spine and back slicing teeth( the serrated teeth are on the back )

Albertosaurus: Tiny crest for recognition and pack hunting instincts

Troodon: Smart brain, strategic hunting

Komodo dragon: Iron reinforced teeth, you wish it was blood

Whiptail lizard: meiosis parthenogenesis reproduction

Dwarf crocodile: SWAT armor


Appearance: ✨

Height: 6 meters at hip, 12 meters long (tail = battering ram)

Weight: Big enough to crush… maybe a small car? (Yes she's on a diet

Skin: Thicc leather with SWAT armor

Neural spine: Runs neck to tail, don't ask why I even added this part

Tiny Albertosaurus crest on head for “hey that’s me” recognition


Head and Teeth: 🦷💀

Front teeth: T. rex-style for gripping Idiotic prey

Back teeth: Acrocanthosaurus style for slicing

Teeth enamel reinforced with iron (ouch x 1000)

Jaw strength: Can probably crush a rhino if she feels like it


Claws and limbs: 💪

Forelimbs: Alxasaurus sickle claws, perfect for slashing, climbing, or scratching really bad itches, shantungosarus for the quadrupedal

Hind limbs: Massive, strong, good for walking and maybe charging slowly but deadly

Tail: Muscular, can swing like a tree trunk, sometimes accidentally hits trees or legs 💀



\---


Behavior: ☺️😡

Hunting: Packs sometimes (Albertosaurus influence) but mostly smart predator (Troodon brain) (sometimes both, because she's not an idiot)

Stalks, ambushes, and can plan attacks—might even wait for prey to make coffee first ""mm coffee, What's that thing staring at me?""

Can reproduce solo (thanks Whiptail lizard), so no dating apps needed

Uses claws defensively, teeth for slicing

Occasionally swings tail into its own legs—oops


\---

Diet:

Mostly meat, opportunistic omnivore if it finds something tasty

Can take down anything smaller than T. rex… or a really unlucky sauropod



\---


Habitat:

Forests, plains, maybe near rivers (likes a bit of water for cooling off)

Avoids crowds unless hunting or in pack


Special Notes:

Tiny crest + neural spine + scutes = visually striking

Iron teeth + claws + brain = terrifyingly efficient predator

Can theoretically have babies alone, so it’s both scary and independent

Lab code hides the full scientific name in plain sight



\---


Known Weaknesses:

No wings (can’t fly, unfortunately)

Big size makes sneaking tricky

Tail swing can sometimes hit self or friends

Possibly annoyed by mosquitoes


Field Joke:

If it flaps arms like it’s waving hello, it’s either saying “sup” or scratching its back.

A few notes!

The parthenogenesis doesn't really pose any virus threats, because it uses meiosis Parthenogenesis, not the useless type!

I hate to think this through, but I am really having a hard time right now understanding her. 

She is a full time housewife - at a very young age. Hindi ko maikakaila that she did everything for us when we were kids. Why is she spoiled? Spoiled kasi she never experienced earning money, and she is getting all our financial needs to my Dad and Lolas. 



Now that we are all working, is it really our responsibility to replace my Dad and Lolas Financially? We are all contributing to our home and it is quite an amount, I would say, but I think it will never be enough for her. Hindi naman kami sa nagdadamot, pero bakit hindi kayang magtipid? Hindi kayang bawasan ng onti? Why are we masasamang Kids just because it was not enough? 



Last 2-3 months ago nga I was heartbroken by her din. I am almost 30 years old and I do have a long time boyfriend. To be honest we were both caught up with our families kaya somehow hindi kami maka-move forward. Para sa akin and sa BF ko it is not in our plans to have Kids yet at this time, kasi feeling namin we wanted to enjoy life muna and spoil ourselves. But then out of nowhere my mom told me like “ alam mo wag na kayo mag anak”. I cried that night with my bf hahaha kasi it was always been in my head to become a mom - just not now. Pero I am always looking up to her and saying na pag ako nag kaanak I will do the same as to what she did to us. Tapos nung narinig ko yon sa kanya naalala ko ung quote sa HIMYM, yung nalaman ni Robin na hindi talaga sya pwede magka baby. “It’s one thing not to want something; it's another to be told you can't have it.” 



Bakit nung panahon nila, their parents supported them sa kasal nila, pag baby and all. Bakit sa generation namin, I am told to not have a baby kasi magastos - hindi ko daw kakayanin, plus kailangan pa namin sila intindihin? Bakit noon their parents supported them, bakit kami we needed to support them 100% to the point na kailangan na namin tipirin sarili namin? Are they spoiled? 



I honestly hate thinking this way, I hate hating my parents - kasi hindi dapat. We are thought to respect them, pero bakit habang tumatanda tayo we are slowly being an adult just like them and it seems like ngayon lang natin nakikita how imperfect they are. I chose to stay here with them - kasi alam ko in the future iiwan nila kami, I wanted to spend time with them, grow old with them. Pero bakit ung pagstay sa side nila requires sacrifices? to the point na hindi namin pwede ienjoy ang sarili naming pera - because they needed it din, yung may bibilin kami pero need pa namin ipaalam sa kanya na “hindi ma, mura lang to”. Bakit kami pa din yung masama? Are we really that bad?



I wanted to be more, I wanted to do things for myself, gusto kong mag birthday manlang when I turned 30, pero bawal - hindi sila masaya about it. I wanted to study ulit, mag ipon, mag coffee with friends. pero Kapag gumagala kami, sinasama naman siya pero mostly ayaw nya kasi nga mas gusto nalang nya na pera nalang. Nasanay ba sya na laging may hawak ng pera that it triggers her pag wala? 



And when she needs money, shes asking for it in a demanded way (like it was truly our responsibility to give) Why is it pag nagtanong ka, sisigawan ka agad? Ang Frustrating. Bilang babeng anak hindi ko alam kung ang pinaka tamang decision nalang is to move out? Kasi pakiramdam ko mas lalala ang situation namin If I stayed a bit longer? 



Ayokong isipin lahat ng mga sinabi ko dito, hindi ba pwedeng maging tulad nalang kami ng dati? Kaso wala ehh we were in a situation na kinausap nya pa kaming magkakapatid that what we are giving is not enough. That we are no use, na wala kaming kwentang anak, that we do not care for her. It breaks my heart to hear that, kasi out of everyone from us na magkakapatid ako lagi nag eeffort to make her birthday more special, every mother’s day. MInsan kinakausap ko pa ung isang kapatid ko para di sila mag away. Pero iba talaga ang tampo nya if you didn’t give her the amount of money that she asks. But still we were called as walang kwenta. 


I stayed here coz I thought matutulungan ko sila because ofcourse ako ang daughter nya, I thought she would listen to me, kahit yung sa mga small details lang para makapag tipid. But it is really true no, ang isang bahay can only have 1 queen. Naririnig ko lang to sa nga stories about in-laws. Pero bakit ako na anak nya, she doesn’t want to listen at all? Nagbibigay naman kasi kami and it was really a big chunk of money but then again not enough. I can see that we can mend other expenses in the house but shes not willing to change it. Its as if, bat di ikaw gumawa? Tapos magagalit and hindi makikipagusap. Ang frustrating! 



Why does she kept on breaking my heart? shes my mom, and I hate to hate her. I dont know what to do. ",1,1763870707.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False

I think I tend to get pity sex about once or twice a month during the same week, if that. It’s painful if a month is skipped. Some symptoms:

- She went through weight gain. She’s 5’1” 150 lbs. I’m leaner at 5’10” 165 lbs.

- We’ve been together for about 10 years, and are childfree

- Sex is odd. She has never enjoyed oral much, compared to my previous relationships, and she doesn’t enjoy vibrators. Her method of masturbation is to lay face down on a bed and grind on it. She appears to orgasm during normal piv (this is normal for me, most of my girlfriends always have). She’s not a huge fan of foreplay or kissing, which I think is unfortunately a big red flag. Massages don’t get me sex. Doing chores obviously won’t get me sex. There isn’t any extra variety in bed she seems to crave. 

- Her periods apparently murder her a bit. Hence the only time we ever have sex tends to be right after her period ends. Recently, she’s trying out a birth control patch to lower symptoms, but it might be making things even worse in terms of libido. 

- She says stuff like “you think about sex too much”, “she doesn’t need sex at all for a relationship”, she gets a little offended if I say “I consider sex to be important for love”, etc. 

Tl;dr: I’m 29 years old, and I feel like I’m kind of starting to waste my life on someone who doesn’t even want me. Some stranger off Tinder would probably sleep with me after a coffee date more easily than her, and I’m starting to believe I should divorce her, if I have any self respect.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

AIO?","I’ve been seeing a guy who is very serious about saving money for the future. He constantly preaches to me about saving money that is mine and brags about how much he is saving for his future kids.

He has suggested that I should also cut back on small things I enjoy like Starbucks, getting my nails done (like 2x a year!), or buying clothes from Lululemon/Aritzia. He says I should make my coffee at home, do my own nails, and buy clothes from TJMaxx like him. He frames it as being smart and thinking ahead for future kids, but we are not engaged and not even living together. I also hate how he deliberately makes our dates cheap (i.e., invites me to see only movies HE wants to see) when he can be generous towards himself (i.e., going to see a Broadway show by himself, which is more $$, every weekend).

I get being responsible, but it feels strange and controlling to be told to live like I already have children when that is not our reality. I also don't like being criticized for getting Starbucks once a week when it's **MY OWN MONEY**.

1p4czax,https://i.redd.it/epyz7138kx2g1.jpeg,Food Review: The Pizzeria (Mission),"I’d like to tell you a story. It’s either late 80s or early 90s and it’s just me and my mom at The Plaza Mall. We’ve gone through the routine of JC Penny’s, Dillards, and Sears and now it’s time for my food court reward for not misbehaving. Many of you might not remember or have been born yet, but the place that took center stage and what was my favorite pizza place to this day was Luca Pizza. I’ll always remember a worker wearing their chef’s whites offering samples in the dining area, and my mom taking one for each of us. Every time I ate a piece I thought, “man, no wonder the Ninja Turtles love pizza so much”.

And then one day it was gone. The pizzeria that I loved so much growing up was no longer there, and it felt like it took all my memories with it. I thought that was it. All we have left here in The Valley is global pizza chains. Nothing made with heart. But then a cousin of mine told me that one of the cooks opened up his own place in Mission on Conway called “Pizza di Roma”. Familiar faces. Familiar flavors. Familiar memories. After getting a haircut at Tatan’s I would drive over and walk through the back entrance after passing their herb garden and get a pie. Things were right in the world, and wouldn’t you know it, I came to learn that the full name of Luca Pizza was “Luca Pizza di Roma”. Hah!

And then one day it was gone. The doors were shut. The lights were off. Surely this can’t be happening again right? Of course it was. The story would repeat itself with yet another pizzeria with the same staff called Titto’s Pizzeria in Palmview until that too was gone, only this time there was no new incarnation. The spiritual descendants of Luca Pizza in The Plaza Mall were now all gone. There was no more pizza to be made from them anymore. Their story, as far as I know, had ended.

And then one day I discovered The Pizzeria. The same cousin recommended it saying it reminded him of Pizza di Roma. Familiar ingredients! Familiar flavors! So, of course, I made the trek to Harlingen. 

Has anyone ever had that experience where they open the doors to a restaurant and you’re immediately hit in the face with the smell that defines their restaurant? For steak houses it’s the smell of the smoke coming from a seared steak, for panaderias it’s the smell of sugar and freshly baked bread, and for coffee shops it’s the smell of the sweetness of freshly ground coffee beans. For The Pizzeria, it was the smell of a caramelized pizza crust, the burnt flour left over in the oven, and the unmistakable heat and smell of a 450 degree oven that has baked thousands of pies in its lifetime. 

Now, I’ve been a loyal fan of this local pizza chain for years, and when their Harlingen location first opened, I still remember walking in and feeling like I had stepped into a true, passion-driven pizzeria. The place had energy, heart, and a sense of pride. Perhaps not familiar faces, but familiar flavors and, yes, familiar memories.

But lately, something’s changed, and not for the better. My recent visits to the Mission location have felt strangely lifeless in comparison. While the ingredients are still fresh, the execution hasn’t been keeping up. The crusts come out uneven, the bakes inconsistent, and the attention to detail that once defined them seems to be fading.

The frustrating part is that they still have all the ingredients (pun intended) to be great. Every single bite I take I think “This is good, and it’s so close to being great, but it’s just not there.” What’s lacking now is technique and care. The fundamentals aren’t being applied with the same precision or passion they used to, and the result shows.

I genuinely hope they can turn things around, because this isn’t a lost cause. They’ve proven before, especially in those early Harlingen days, that they can deliver pizza with real heart. With a renewed focus on craftsmanship and consistency, they could easily reclaim what made them special. I want to keep cheering for them, but they need to rediscover the spark that once set them apart.

my normal dietary day consists of :

In the morning 1 cup black coffee with 2 ounces (by weight) of tallow blended in

about 32 ounces of water throughout the work day

dinner consists of 1.5-2.5 pounds of Chuck Roast standard cheap grocery store stuff depending on how hungry i feel

about 30-40 ounces of water in the evening as i watch videos, do housework etc

occasionally one of those baby belle cheese rounds or a 1/2 cup or so of cottage cheese for ""dessert"". my body doesn't like cheese that much but i love the way it tastes so it is an occasional treat.

a few times a month instead of chuck roast  I do pork shoulder steaks, chicken drumsticks (6 each) or thighs (4)  or a pound of 80/20 ground beef (i can't eat much more than that at a time), or a half dozen baby chickens with a 1/4 pound of bacon as a scramble.

I know he wants tapioca pearls, tea, milk and probably a random flavor that sounds weird, warm not hot.  The menu boards I see refer to toppings and foam.  To me a topping is like whipped cream and sprinkles and foam is for arts and crafts. Alas, I see no sprinkles mentioned.

Also, are boba and bubbles synonymous?  I am thinking the words refer to the little tapioca balls?  Do different size/color balls taste different?

1p4cqf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1p4cqf8/villain_origin_story_birthday_canceled_after/,Villain origin story: birthday canceled after friends flake,"This is very long vent. It's sad in a boring way because it'd be three times longer if I tried to be funny. I'm already quite evil (affirmative) but I'm trying not to be evil (derogatory) after the shit tornado that hit me last weekend.



I've had the same friend group for over a decade. We're in our late twenties/early thirties and met back in high school/college. Most of us are neurodivergent and/or queer, and we also have a fair amount of religious trauma which has helped us bond. We've all kept in touch throughout the years by playing tabletop games together (DnD, Monster of the Week, etc.) Different people have come and gone, but it's been a pretty solid group for a while. We've also tried to be patient and understanding with one another given our backgrounds and varied mental health. I've always thought these people were my ride-or-die \[Dom Toretto voice\] *\**family,\* but I'm realizing lately that this is a one-way sentiment. My spouse and best friend are exceptions to this, and they've also been pissed at our friends for the issues I'm listing below.

  
I canceled my birthday party this year because practically none of my friends could make it anyways. I'd let them know about it a month in advance, and they all seemed excited, but when I asked for a headcount the week prior to the party, suddenly they had schedule conflicts. I ended up canceling the party so I didn't have to face the embarrassment of no one showing up.

It wouldn't be that big a deal, but this is the latest letdown in a string going back to last year:

* **Flaked on reading my book**
   * This one hurt the most. Last year, they agreed to beta read my book to give me feedback. I said multiple times there were no hard feelings if they couldn't do it, but they all still agreed. I even offered to pay them a bit ($50) though they volunteered for free. 
   * Almost none of them finished, even after assuring me multiple times that they would. I get confused/frustrated because they'll occasionally bring up how they're excited for my next book, but none of them bothered to read the previous one.
   * I'm having a hard time working on my next book because whenever I sit down, all I think about is how my friends can't be paid to read my book. Why would a stranger pay money to buy it?
   * I don't try to write for anyone but myself, but damn--I already knew I wouldn't have support for my queer books from my religious parents. I'd really thought I had it from my friends, but I guess not.
* **Flaked on our housewarming party**
   * My spouse and I bought a house. We spent months renovating and unpacking so the place was up-to-code and comfy.
   * I gave a two month notice about our housewarming, but when the date approached, most suddenly couldn't make it.
* **Flaked on important friend meetup**
   * Over the summer, a friend from out of town stay with us. This friend was from the other side of the country. I was so excited for them to meet my friend group because we have a lot of common interest.
   * I'd organized a movie night with all of us at a local venue. I gave two months notice and surprise--they once again couldn't make it.
   * I was so embarrassed because I'd talked about this group with my traveling friend. I'm worried I came across like a creepy loser who made up the group (*i.e. that kid in high school who totally had a supermodel girlfriend that could play X-box with her toes. She just goes to another school. No, really! /s*).
* **Constant 1-1 flaking**
   * This is a general trend, but I'm always the one reaching out to individuals for coffee/dinner. I'm never the one invited.
   * I get two responses:
      * *""Oh, I'd love to but I'm busy this week. Maybe next week. I'll let you know""* \- Which I totally understand, but then they never reach out.
      * *""Sure, sounds great!""* \- But when the date arrives, they cancel, sometimes just a few hours in advance.
   * It's become such a constant trend with multiple people that I don't bother reaching out anymore. It's less painful than being blown off or stood up.
* **Shitty (or no) gifts**
   * This is another general trend. I consistently get bad gifts while I always go out of my way to give thoughtfully. I spend the year picking up gifts from craft fairs and comic conventions, then squirreling them away so they're ready for gifting events. These friends tend to get me cheap things they impulse buy that I don't like or want. (Yes, I've made lists to help, and it doesn't change things.)
   * One example--one friend was really into this snail game and also likes to collect rocks. 
      * I got them a rock tumbler that looked like a snail. I ordered it two months in advance so it would arrive in time for the holidays, and they loved it! 
      * But this same friend also game me a couple dollar store plastic dinosaurs they bought on the way to the gift exchange.
   * It's not abnormal for multiple of these friends to say ""Oh, your gift is in the mail!"" Then never give me anything.
   * I've also had a few gifts given 6+ months after the fact. 
      * While I'm grateful I got anything, that doesn't stop me from feeling like shit the day of the event when I'm giving them a thoughtful gift and I go home with nothing.
      * I never get a head's up either, which means the disappointment is sprung on me when I'm in a group setting and not when I'm alone and an process.
   * I feel like a joke to them--like I'm not a person with depth or dimension, but a silly little meme that only requires two second of acknowledgement. I don't feel like they see me as an equal. In fact, I feel like I'm their little autistic pet they keep around for giggles.

So while the birthday thing sucks by itself, it also feels like a fat bowling ball dropped on the camel's back in context of this last year of flops. My list above is massive because I feel like I need to back up my feelings with concrete evidence or I'll be told, ""You need to be more patient! I'm sure they mean well."" 

To anyone who wants to me to consider the other side, I've only done that until recently and look where that's gotten me. I mean this with the utmost disrespect: fuck you. 

* You are offering me lawn clippings and saying, *I'm sure this grass is sorry it's not nutritious, but you need to only eat this and be happy for it. Some people don't even have grass! Smile, or we won't let you lick the inside of the lawnmower's bag.*
* Hello, yes, I'm starving for love and a slice of respect, extra whip. I'm sorry that's inconvenient for you and this group of people who's love for me is as deep as a pie pan. But I need something to change before I turn into a dust, because I'm already a withered husk.

Now I'm here, another year older and feeling a lot less loved than just a month ago. My spouse and best friend have tried to comfort me. While it's helped dampen the blow, I just feel gutted. It's like I'm back in middle school looking for a lunch tables and knowing that none of my classmates would invite me over.

One glimmer of hope though--I've been getting birthday cards in the mail (all well-past my birthday). The words are nice I guess, but it's an eyedropper of water on a forest fire.

I'm not sure if it's better to withdraw. Am I being bitter, or preserving my worth? I'll be pretty isolated if I drop off completely, and that's bad, but so is crying my eyes out every time I'm flaked on. At least I'm funny sometimes.",3,1763869611.0,evilautism,0,1.0,False

I'm not gonna lie, I've been having some seriously existential dread scrolling through LinkedIn lately. 😬

But here's the thing I realized after my third panic-induced coffee this morning: freaking out doesn't actually solve anything. We gotta adapt, right?

Instead of pinching pennies and hoping for the best, shouldn't we be investing in *ourselves*? Like, leveling up our skills so we're not completely obsolete in five years?

I've been seriously digging into this idea of ""upskilling"" lately, and honestly, it feels way more empowering than just cutting back on avocado toast (which, let's be honest, I'm never doing anyway).

Here's what's been swirling around in my brain:

*   **AI is coming for the repetitive stuff.** Anything that can be automated *will* be automated. Let's just accept it.
*   **Human skills are still valuable.** Creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence… these are things robots can't (yet?) replicate.
*   **The best defense is a good offense.** Instead of fearing AI, learn to use it!

And speaking of learning to use it... I stumbled across this AI upskilling platform the other day – it’s called AutomateItPro (you can check it out here: [https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals](https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals)). Seems pretty legit; it teaches you practical AI skills you can actually use in your day-to-day work. I mean, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right? Plus it's helping me understand how to use these new tools to *avoid* those repetitive tasks, so I can focus on… well, actually interesting stuff.

It's kinda wild how quickly things are changing. Remember when ""knowing how to use Excel"" was a major job skill? Now it's like... baby's first spreadsheet.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, let's not get caught flat-footed. Let's be proactive and learn the skills we need to thrive in this new AI-powered world. Is this the path? I don't know! But I'm choosing to believe it's better than stressing about that avocado toast. 🤷‍♀️",1,1763869431.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1p4cnvh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4cnvh,São Paulo Grand Prix Champions Club Review,"This is going to be longwinded, so apologies in advance. I'm trying to address every question I had when I was considering where to sit and whether CC was worth it. The answer for us is an unqualified ""yes"".

My wife and I just got back from an extended South American vacation that included attending the São Paulo GP in the Champions Club. There was shockingly little information that I could find online, so I felt like sharing our experience in order to help people in the future who are considering it, especially given the hefty price tag (We paid $8,600 for two tickets through F1 Experiences). 

Overall, I'd give it a 9.5 out of 10. The experience was really fantastic and there is almost nothing I would change. Everyone we interacted with, from the F1 Experiences staff to the local workers were wonderful, and the atmosphere at Interlagos is absolutely second to none. 

The View:

I doubt there are many spots at any track that offer a wider view of the circuit than the CC at Interlagos. Situated about four stories above the track in a two-story structure atop Grandstand A, the CC gives a commanding view of about 2/3 of the circuit. The width of the club extends from about P5-P16 on the starting grid, and you can see from about T14 to just past P1 right in front of you on the near side (i.e, the entire starting grid and then some). Due to the elevation of the club and the track topography, you can also look straight across the circuit and see just about all of T4-T12. Basically all you can't see is the Senna S (admittedly the best part of the track) and Juncao. You also have a clear view of the pit entry, the first two or three garages, the podium, parc ferme, and the media/interview area. Again, I can't think of many spots on the calendar that offer such a killer view of the circuit and racing. 

The Space:

The club is set over two floors, with three different areas. The lower level has a large area to the right with several large tables and about 60-80 chairs. This area is climate controlled and fully enclosed. The other space on the lower level is a small lounge with a few coffee tables and high-top tables. This space is also fully enclosed, and is on the corner of the CC, so it offers clear views towards T14 as the cars approach the finish line. There is a small outdoor balcony off of this area which offers by far the best view from the CC. However, as we quickly learned, there is *absolutely no* food or drink. This is the only reason it's not a 10/10 as everyone was pretty annoyed by the totally pointless rule. We even raised the issue with the F1 Experiences staff, who were sympathetic and said it wasn't their rule. Seems credible because the only person enforcing the rule was one rather strict Brazilian fire marshall. 

Upstairs, there is an open air level with about ten or so high-top tables and about 40 high top seats. There are also two ""sims"" up here (PS5 running F1 24). The view from here was even better than the lower level, but it is still partially enclosed, and everything you're looking at on track is through glass. I would prefer if the glass were so you didn't have to look through it, but it's obviously for safety and you get used to it pretty quickly. I am tall enough that I was able to hold my camera over my head and get some decent shots of Sectors 2 and 3 (Laranjinha in particular). Once we realized we couldn't drink on the lower level balcony, this is where we spent virtually all of our time and we loved every second. There's also a TV right across from the CC that is easily visible from any location. 

The Hospitality:

As stated above, all the staff and workers were super friendly and hospitable. Among non F1 Experiences staff, there was relatively little English, but I speak decent Portuguese. Even if you don't, it's not much of an issue in this setting. The lower level had a wine cart with about 3 or 4 red/whites as well as champagne. I'm not a wine drinker so I can't comment on the quality of what they were serving, but we drank a ton of champ which was plenty drinkable. Both floors had a limited selection of whiskey and vodka, as well as all the Heineken (and 0.0) you could drink. The club was open from 9-6, and alcohol service began at 11 or 1130 each day. 

The food was all served buffet style on the lower floor. I would equate it to high-quality wedding or airport lounge food with enough variety across the three days to suit any palate. There was breakfast until late morning, followed by lunch that stayed out for a while and was regularly refreshed. The lines were never long and there was plenty of space to eat. Coffee and tea were available all day. After lunch, there was also very good dessert each day. Options were broad. 

The Experiences:

Our tickets included a one-time paddock tour as well as a grid walk/photo with the trophies. I wish there were a pit walk too, but oh well. We received the time for our paddock tour about a week before the race. It was at 9:30 on Saturday. Some people changed theirs around, and I think we could have too, but 90 min before the sprint seemed like it would be a good time. The tour was close to an hour long, and we saw Bearman, Vowles, Vasseur, Stella, and Komatsu. It was very cool and our guide was super chill. 

At 6 on Saturday, we were escorted down to the track for a photo with the trophies. This felt very assembly-line-esque, but it was still awesome getting to go onto the track and see the trophies up close. 

The vibe in the CC was not stuffy at all. I was worried it might be a lot of the corporate/free tickets/super bowl crowd like you get in the paddock club, but that was not the case at all (at least upstairs). The fans were all die hard and we made a lot of new friends, including two lovely British women who had been to Melbourne, Singapore, Mexico, and SP this year. 

We also got a ""free"" gift we could select from F1 Authentics for each ticket. We chose an AMG pen and a Lando print. 

One thing I was worried about, having previously sat in premium-but-general admission seating at other races, was whether it would feel crowded or oversold. It was not at all (looking at you, Montreal Terrace 1973). I don't think there were more than 200-250 guests total in the whole CC. I could be way off, but if you wanted a spot at the front, you could get one with little trouble. You may have to share a table and may not have your own seat, but the vibes were great and people were sharing, laid back, etc. 

On Friday, we arrived an hour before FP1 and had no trouble getting a spot wherever we wanted. On Sat, we got there at open and rushed upstairs to make sure we had a table (since we had identified the day prior exactly where we wanted to be) and it was fine. I don't think it filled up until after we got back from our paddock tour around 11. On Sunday, we got there an hour after open and fortunately our friends had saved us a table and chairs. They said there was a queue to get in and they had to rush up to save a spot. But ultimately, during the race, people shared tables and chairs while also respecting space and belongings such that anyone who wanted a spot up front got one, even if you weren't there early.

Overall:

I can't recommend São Paulo (and the Champions Club) highly enough. Every session was absolutely epic, and the atmosphere was so sick. The walk to and from the train was such a party, and there are dozens of spots to shop/eat/drink along the 30 minute walk from the train to the gate where we entered the circuit. We stayed in Pinheiros about 10 minutes walk from Pinheiros metro and bought tickets for the 25 min [express train](https://passaporte.viamobilidade.com.br) that runs from Pinheiros station straight to the temporary station they set up just for the express trains. Lines at the stations, both morning and evening, were an afterthought. It couldn't have been easier. Express tickets also work on the regular trains, which we took one night. 

We've traveled all over the world and we didn't feel sketchy for a single second in SP. Some of what I'd seen online made it seem like it might be a bit dodgier. Granted, we were mostly either at the track or in the nicer parts of Pinheiros and Jardins, so I realize our experience may have been a bit different given how many tourists (and security) were around. But it was a great experience.

If you're thinking about going to the SPGP, do it. And if you're thinking about spending a bit on CC, *do it*. ",3,1763869395.0,GrandPrixTravel,1,1.0,False

I’m currently based in Bangalore, India,  navigating the exciting world of a Master's program in Psychology. When my head isn’t buried in textbooks or analyzing complex theories, I’m obsessed with challenging myself physically. I’m really into weightlifting and MMA, and generally just love pushing my limits. That feeling of accomplishment after a tough session is the best.

Beyond the gym, I’m a huge advocate for getting into nature. Travel is a priority, and my ideal escape involves throwing on a backpack and heading out for some hiking. I love my academic field, but I also enjoy delving into other areas like philosophy—I’ve found myself really connecting with the beautiful, chaotic honesty of Absurdism lately. When it’s time to wind down, you'll find me glued to a psychological thriller or a good horror movie—though I have a soft spot for those hilarious South Indian horror-comedy combos 😂💖. I also love RPG games, though finding the time to actually play them is a struggle!

On a personal note, I’ve had my own share of battles, including clinical anxiety and a deep sense of loneliness, stemming from a rough upbringing. I’m definitely a work in progress, but I try my best every single day to embrace life and love, navigating the chaos with a dose of dark humor—you know the vibe: ""Should I kill myself or drink a cup of coffee?"" 

I'm truly seeking a genuine connection with someone who values mutual respect and effective communication above all else. We don't have to be on the same page 100% of the time, but as long as there is care and respect, that's enough for me. If you’re in Bangalore, or open to chatting with a thoughtful human who lifts heavy things and ponders the meaninglessness of existence, send me a message! ｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡

Take care! You're precious!

Looked like a tech guy. I said no because I didn’t even notice he was there and he wasn’t even shown in the video until he came up to us and came into frame. Then he started spewing shit like he’s going to call the FBI on us and that he’s part of the FBI and shows his “badge” for a second which is literally just a regular ID.

He also started saying that filming in public is illegal and that we would get 1 year in prison. Then he took another good look at us and said if we weren’t citizens (which we are) we would be sent 5 years in prison then deported under trumps administration. Mind you this entire time we were completely okay with deleting the video and did not really care too much. We show him the video and he’s very clearly not in it and he goes “I’m in it. Delete it now.” So whatever we delete it. He leaves and we’re pretty shook up and scared because wtf just happened. He comes back 5 mins later and asks us to delete it from recently deleted and we were like okay whatever.

As we’re deleting he asks my friend if she’s Indian (she’s half) and starts speaking Hindi to her saying that she better delete the video or he’s going to call his lawyer. She lied and said she didn’t understand it even though she did. Then, he started telling me he knows 5 languages and Hindi is one of them like wtf just leave already. He finally left after lingering.

We were so scared to leave Philz and were pretty shaken up after what happened. We’re both teenage girls just innocently filming a cute review video and this crazy guy comes up to us saying he’s in the FBI and threatening us. We honestly didn’t expect something like this to happen to us especially in Cupertino. I’m not sure if anyone would know this guy but I just wanted to post it here because it was such a weird interaction.",4,1763869294.0,Cupertino,17,0.75,False

My daughter, Sarah, who’s an ER nurse here in town, thinks I’m flying out to be with Mike.

The truth?

It’s 1:00 PM on Thanksgiving Day. I’m 79 years old, living in a quiet house outside Pittsburgh. And I just set the table for one.

My name is Frank. I poured steel at the mill for forty-five years. I’ve seen strikes that split this town in two, I’ve seen presidents come and go, and I’ve seen my kids grow up and move on. My wife, Maria, has been gone for six years. Six long Thanksgivings.

When she was alive, this day started at 6 AM. The house would fill up with the smell of roasting turkey and her sage stuffing by 9 AM. The Macy's parade would be blaring on the TV. I’d be tasked with mashing the potatoes, and I’d always make a mess, and she’d swat me with a dish towel, laughing. The house felt full. It felt alive.

This year, the house is so quiet I can hear the pipes creak.

The calls came last week.

Mike was first. ""Dad, it’s chaos at O'Hare. They're forecasting a blizzard, and Janie’s got that cough again. We just can't risk the flight. You're going to Sarah's, right? You'll have a great time.""

I looked at the framed photo of his family on my mantel. ""You bet, son. Don't you worry about me. You keep those kids warm. I'll be fine at your sister's.""

Then Sarah called, her voice already tired. ""Dad, they've cut our holiday staff again. It's going to be a warzone in the ER. I have to pull a double shift. I’m so, so sorry. But you're going to Mike's, aren't you? Thank God. Give the grandkids a huge hug from me.""

I looked out the window at the empty driveway. ""Of course, sweetheart. You go take care of people. I'm proud of you. I'll be fine with your brother.""

The lies didn't even feel like lies. They felt... easier. Easier than saying the truth: Please. Don't leave me alone. I don't want to be alone.

You spend your whole life being their rock, being the guy who fixes the bike and balances the checkbook. You forget how to tell them that you’re crumbling.

Thanksgiving morning, I woke up before the sun. Habit. I made my coffee and sat at the kitchen table. The silence was deafening. Even my old beagle, Buddy, just slept in his bed, like he knew the day didn't matter.

""We've gotta do something,"" I told him.

I remembered Maria had an old porcelain turkey platter. The one we only used for this day. She kept it on the top shelf of the pantry. I grabbed the old wooden stepladder. The one with the wobbly leg I’d been meaning to fix for a decade.

I was on the top step. I know, not smart. I’m 79, not 29.

I was reaching, my fingers just brushing the cold ceramic, when the step didn't just wobble. It snapped.

I fell backward.

Time slowed down. My head missed the corner of the counter by an inch. I landed flat on my back on the hard linoleum. The wind was punched clean out of me. The platter shattered on the floor next to me, into a hundred white pieces.

I just lay there. Staring at the ceiling. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move.

My first thought wasn't about the pain. It was: This is it. This is how they find you. A day from now. Maybe two. When the calls go unanswered.

Buddy scrambled over, whining, licking my face, frantic. His panic was like a jolt of electricity. ""Alright, boy,"" I wheezed, the words catching in my throat. ""I'm not done yet.""

It took me ten minutes to get to my knees. My hip was screaming. My hands were shaking so hard I couldn't grip the counter. When I finally pulled myself up, I wasn't just an old man anymore. I was an old man who was totally, completely alone.

I skipped the turkey. I swept up the broken pieces and threw them in the trash. I made myself a ham sandwich on white bread.

At 3:00 PM, my phone buzzed. A video call. It was Mike.

His face popped up, smiling, kids yelling in the background. ""Hey Dad! How's Sarah's place? Is the food good? Put her on, I want to say hi!""

I hadn't planned for this. My camera was pointed right at my empty kitchen. At my single plate. At my ham sandwich.

""She's... in the kitchen, son,"" I stammered.

""Well, yell for her!"" he laughed.

Mike's wife, Karen, appeared over his shoulder. ""Frank! Let me see the table! Did Sarah make her famous green bean casserole?""

I saw them see it. The way my kitchen was dark. The way the table behind me was empty, except for one plate.

Mike's smile didn't just fade. It fell.

""Dad... where is Sarah?"" he asked, his voice quiet.
I couldn't lie anymore. ""She's at the hospital, Mike. She's working a double.""
""Then... where are you?""
""I'm at home, son. It's fine. I just...""
""You're alone?""

His face went pale. I could see the realization hit him like a physical blow. He didn't know I could hear him yell to his wife, ""He's alone! He's been alone all day! He lied to us!""

Before I could say ""Don't be silly,"" the call ended.

I sat there in the silence, feeling ashamed. Like I'd been caught. I turned on the TV. A football game. The announcer was yelling about something. I didn't care.

Two hours later. It was dark. Buddy started barking, a real, frantic bark.

Headlights sliced through the living room window.

A car door slammed. Then another.

I pulled myself up, my hip throbbing, and went to the front door.

It was Sarah's little hatchback, and Mike's rented SUV.

They tumbled out. Sarah was still in her blue hospital scrubs, her hair a mess, her eyes red. Mike and Karen were in sweatpants, their kids trailing behind in pajamas, clutching pillows.

I opened the door, and the cold November air hit my face.

Sarah didn't say anything. She just walked past me, dropped her bag, and hugged me so hard I thought my ribs would crack. She buried her face in my old flannel shirt. ""I'm so sorry, Dad. I'm so, so sorry.""

Mike came in right behind her. He was carrying a foil pan. ""We're idiots,"" he said, his voice thick. ""We're just... we're idiots. We're here.""

His kids, half-asleep, wrapped their arms around my legs.

We crowded around that old kitchen table. We pulled out chairs from the dining room. Mike's pan was lukewarm stuffing from his interrupted dinner. Karen had grabbed a half-eaten pumpkin pie. Sarah had stopped for a bucket of chicken on the way from the hospital.

We ate cold chicken and lukewarm stuffing off paper plates. My grandkids fell asleep on the sofa. We talked. We really talked.

It was the best Thanksgiving I’ve ever had.

Here’s what I learned last night, and what I wish every grown child could feel deep in their bones:

We, your parents, are from a generation that doesn't know how to ask for help. We'll say ""I'm fine"" and ""Don't make a fuss"" until our very last breath. We'd rather eat a ham sandwich alone than make you feel guilty.

Your job is to know that we are lying.

Your job is to ask again. Your job is to call your sibling and check.

So if your mom or dad sounds a little too ""okay"" this holiday, or any day, call their bluff.

Turn the car around. Show up late. Bring leftovers. Bring a bucket of chicken. It doesn't matter.

Because these houses get silent. These bones get brittle. And one day, you'll give anything in the world to break that silence, to sit at that table just one more time... and you won't be able to.

Don't wait. #fblifestyle

I wanted to share this habit method with you because over the past month I finally realized it actually works.

I first came across it years ago in Atomic Habits by James Clear, did not pay much attention to it and never applied it, because at first glance it seemed ineffective to me. 

So what is it? The method is called habit stacking and it looks like this:

`After I do X, I will do Y`

You take something you already do on autopilot and attach a new behavior to it. The existing habit becomes the cue.

So I decided to actually try it, and it worked. I believe that the reason it worked is that the repetition and the timing made the new habits I decided to sttack feel automatic after a while.

A few examples from my life:

1. After every focused work block, I do push-ups and squats to failure.
2. When I get in bed, instead of scrolling, I read for 30 minutes.
3. After I make my morning coffee, I go outside to get sunlight in my eyes(Huberman Advice).

These were things I already wanted to do, but not so much to actually do them, if that makes any sense. 

If you have small habits you keep postponing especially the seemingly easy ones that, you don't do anyway, I believe  this method to be surprisingly effective.

I’m curious:

I am wondering what got people interested in drinking tea. I started drinking tea in 2013 when I got a gym membership (which I only kept for a year). I made some changes to my diet. I stopped buying those fake juices like Fruité. I started drinking tea instead. I figured eliminating one cup of a sugary drink a day would be great for me. I was growing up and needed to stop eating and drinking like a teenager. I was never really big - just a bit chubby and I still am. I am glad that tea is becoming more popular. Coffee isn't my thing. I don't get why people drink it daily and why they have more than one cup per day. I don't drink it unless it is free (although I used to take advantage of the $1 McDonald's coffee promotion but I don't care about it anymore especially since McDonald's no longer gives out rewards cards and the stickers for them). I do enjoy a good latté or cappuccino. Anyway, I would love to know why you became interested in tea. I love that there are so many different flavours. I have one cup a day most days. I drink a cup in the morning or early afternoon. I don't have the best diet but I certainly don't have a terrible diet. I love my sweet treats. Drinking tea regularly is my way of doing something that should be good for my body but how much good is it really doing?

Me (F20) and my now ex best friend (also F20) met during the first year of high school when we were both 14. We had similar interests and everything so we got close fairly quickly but I also realized she needed validation a bit. At the time, she lied to me and our other friends about couple of things (like how rich her family was and how they owned restaurants and hospitals, in reality both of her parents have regular jobs). On top of that, she would constantly have panic attacks that would cause her to be unable to move, have some heart problems or to have an immobile leg at some point, those panic attacks have magically stopped after a year or two (without any psychological help). I decided to brush off these things because most teenagers that age seek attention and sometimes lie to get that. One thing that was constant, however, was her need of male attention and validation. Over the course of our friendship, she would constantly act like every guy around us had a crush on her and that she had a special relationship with them all. Sometimes, it started to feel like she was putting herself in a competition with me. For example, whenever I had a close friendship with any guy, she would somehow end up being friends with that guy too. This only applied for guy friends, she never tried to be close with our girl friends throughout our friendship. 

This situation did not really bother me at first. I thought it was just a small, psychological complex she had with all men around her. And like I said before, we were pretty young. However, this changed when I had my first ever boyfriend when I was 17. He (now M20) was in our school too and my ex best friend knew him already. Let’s call him “ex1”. Before we started dating, my ex best friend and ex1 went out once to get some coffee and all of our friend group joked about how it was a date. She denied this clearly and after a couple months we started talking and thus, dating. Due to their old ‘friendship’, they were always close during our relationship. At one point, this got too much and it started to annoy me. Other people would see him around us and would think they were dating instead of me and ex1. I had a serious talk with him and he maintained his distance afterwards. However, things got worse when we broke up. After a few months of our breakup, I heard that my ex best friend and ex1 were actually texting a lot. I even learned that the screenshots she would send to me were actually from him and she edited them to someone else’s name (I have no idea why she did this). Additionally, she was already playing video games with him at this point, though not alone (I knew about this and even when I was unhappy, she continued to play). I confronted her, she denied, we stopped talking. 

So, right before we stopped being friends, I started dating “ex2” (M20). Weirdly, this guy was my ex best friend’s friend from middle school. She was the one who introduced us and at first, we met through playing video games together. We hit it off pretty quickly and he was very clear about his intentions for me. However, my ex best friend always talked about him in a way that implied ex2 had a crush on her. She told me that they decided to get married after a certain age if they were both single, and that when ex2 met her mom, she said to my ex best friend that he probably had a crush on her. She also told me she really wanted to date him at some point and that he was her type (every guy is). I tried to refrain from having any further romantic relationship with ex2, and even told him about this situation, but he said he didn’t care about my ex best friend. He told me that he never liked her that much or anything, that they were just playing video games and nothing more. After his dismissal, and a few months, I talked with my ex best friend and she said she was totally fine with me and ex2 dating. She always had a crush on different guys and they were never really serious, so I did not really take her thing with ex2 seriously. 

After we stopped being friends , me and ex2 eventually broke up. She also started dating a guy from our high school who I go to the same university with (fun fact: I was the matchmaker for them, lol). Now, long story short, they broke up after a few months and he told me that ex2 and my ex best friend started following each other again on her priv account. Ex2 removed her back when we were dating and I told him to remove her and he did without thinking. Now, after almost year and a half, they are following each other again. And after checking their game profiles, I can confirm that they are actually actively playing games together (and also following each other on spotify). Now, I cannot lie, this is making me very mad. I am very disappointed at ex2 for still talking to her even though he knew exactly what she did. Plus, she did this to ex1 too but apparently she has no remorse. Me and her ex boyfriend are somewhat close and we thought that maybe we can at least make her a bit frustrated by posting a few stories together. Nothing crazy though, just very vague photos. Would that be too petty and unnecessary and make me the AH? I also feel like she might have a complex about me ‘stealing’ her guys, I do not know if I am the AH for that.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Fulham vs. Sunderland: A Tale of Toenail-Clipping Tactics and a Goal That Broke the Internet**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the most *edge-of-your-seat* thriller of the season: Fulham vs. Sunderland, a match so dramatic, it makes a soap opera look like a nap. The final score? Fulham 1, Sunderland 0. But how did we get here? Let’s dissect this like a particularly motivated PE teacher dissecting a chicken (with questionable coordination).

**1. Parse the Odds: Because Math Never Lies (Unless It’s Sunderland’s Budget)**  
Let’s assume Fulham entered this match as -200 favorites, implying a 66.67% chance to win. Sunderland, meanwhile, lurked at +300, suggesting bookmakers gave them a 25% shot—roughly the same odds as a koala napping through a bushfire. Why the gulf? Fulham’s defense has leaked just 15 goals this season (a leak, sure, but not a flood), while Sunderland’s attack has mustered all the creativity of a toddler in a crayon factory—colorful, chaotic, and unlikely to score.

Historically, Fulham has won 5 of the last 8 meetings, a trend that Sunderland fans probably explain by claiming the opposition “cheated with better socks.” But stats don’t lie! Or do they? Ask the guy who “accidentally” added an extra zero to his team’s win total in 2018.

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and One Player Who Still Wears Shin Guards as Socks**  
Fulham’s star striker, *let’s call him “The Human Highlight Reel”* (real name: Marcus?), returned from a hamstring injury sustained while tripping over his own shoelaces during a grocery run. Meanwhile, Sunderland’s defense is a rotating door of injuries: their captain, *let’s dub him “Captain Clumsy”* (real name: Kevin?), is out with a “knee complaint” likely caused by attempting to do a cartwheel during warmups.

Sunderland’s manager, *let’s go with “Tactician Ted”* (real name: someone with a mustache), admitted post-match that his team’s strategy was “to play it cool… but we brought a kettle to the pitch.” Translation: their “game plan” involved more hoping than plotting.

**3. Humorous Spin: Football So Boring, Even the Grass Napped**  
Sunderland’s offense was so anemic, it makes a vampire blush. Their best chance? A shot that hit the post… which was *also* their goalkeeper’s elbow. A true Hail Mary, if Mary had a concussion and a grudge.

Fulham’s defense? A fortress guarded by a man who once stopped a penalty by *accidentally* sneezing on the shooter. Goalkeeper *“Big Bertha”* (real name: someone with a better sense of humor) was so untested, he spent 80 minutes texting his barista about coffee preferences.

The lone goal? A 30-yard screamer from The Human Highlight Reel, who later tweeted, “This goal was so easy, my grandma could’ve scored… and she’s in a wheelchair.”

**4. Prediction: The Verdict That Surprised No One**  
Fulham’s victory was as inevitable as taxes in April. With Sunderland’s defense resembling a sieve at a metalworks convention and Fulham’s attack finally clicking (thanks to Marcus’s return), the result was a masterclass in “meh, but better.”

**Final Whistle:** Fulham wins 1-0, because Sunderland’s best play was a forward who tried to score by *throwing* the ball at the net. Spoiler: it didn’t work.

Next time, Sunderland, maybe try not to field a team that looks like they’re playing football in a dream. Or, you know, *practice*.

1p4c1nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/expo/comments/1p4c1nm/i_just_launched_my_first_mobile_app_spensio/,"I just launched my first mobile app, Spensio!","Hey everyone!

I’m super excited to share my first ever mobile app, Spensio. Built with React Native + Expo!  
After months of hard work, countless redesigns, and trying to perfect every detail, it’s finally available on the App Store! *(Play Store version coming soon.)*

# Why I built it

Where I live, many teens and young adults work in cafés, restaurants, bars, and similar jobs. Unlike full-time roles with fixed salaries, these jobs usually pay based on hours or days worked, with no contract or insurance, so income changes constantly.

I used to track my shifts in the Notes app — basically a messy spreadsheet. It was inefficient and easy to mess up, like forgetting a day or logging future shifts that got cancelled.

Spensio handles all of this automatically. It calculates totals, tracks worked days, free days, weekends, and more.

But that’s not all. You can log inflows and outflows using pre-made categories or create custom labels for anything you want. From your daily coffee or matcha habit, to side hustle earnings, small business revenue, or supply costs. Over time, you’ll see clear trends, track your biggest income sources and expenses, and understand your spending and earning habits in a visual, organized way.

I know this app isn’t for everyone, but I hope it reaches the people who will find it useful — helping them see where their money goes, cut unnecessary costs, save a little, or simply keep track of their shifts.

There are three subscription tiers, all offering the same features. Users simply choose how much they want to support the app. I kept prices affordable and avoided locking essential features behind paywalls… but as devs, we know costs add up.

Within the first hour of launching, I got my first subscription. It was a friend showing support, and yes, Apple took 30%, but it still felt amazing. That little support made all the hard work feel worth it. 🧸

I’d really appreciate it if you want to check it out and share your honest thoughts.

1p4c1mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1p4c1mr/7_month_old_dog_thinks_its_always_playtime_and/,7 month old dog thinks it’s always playtime and it’s stressful for me,"Sorry for the long read in advance. As the caption says, my dog thinks all day every day is for play. She is a 7 month old blind STUBBORN husky x. Simple quick things are way more complicated than it should be.

I sit on the couch and she will jump up next to me and bite me, jump over me, and bark at me. I have give her a bone or toy that she can play with, ignore her and get up if needed. I know some people have mixed thoughts on getting up as it could be showing her that she “won” and some say it’s showing her I don’t care for the behaviour. I have also been told to put her on the floor with her bone/toy every time she jumps up but she will just drop it and come right back up ready to go more and more. She doesn’t just nip, she does nip but she also full mouth around my arms biting. 

She asks to go outside but doesn’t go out to pee, when she was younger she was good at it but now that she’s older she doesn’t ever go out to do anything. I will open the door, she goes out but as soon as I have the door shut again she’s barking non stop at it and when I open it she’s immediately play bowing and pouncing around for me to chase her. When I step out with her she bites my arms, legs, pulls my clothes. I will turn back on to her and not acknowledge her or I will sit on the railing and ignore her in hopes she will just go do her business. That only works 1/5 times. Most times she will just try to jump up to me or will sit and bark until I go back inside. She also refuses to come back inside and I need to bribe her in with treats. I can’t pick her up since she’s heavy and when I approach she thinks it’s to play.

I took her to 8 week long puppy class starting when she was 4 months old and I hate to say she was the work behaved the entire time and didn’t quite seem to pick up on anything we were taught. It’s been very difficult trying to teach her anything. Now I hate to make it seem like I am blaming someone or pointing fingers, but my boyfriend (who wanted the dog) works rotational work, 2 weeks away and 2 home, definitely throws off any consistency I try to have for the dog. I wake up every morning with the dog at 7am and give her breakfast in a slow feeder dish, frozen, kong filled, balled up towels, etc. which takes her 20-30 mins to eat then I get ready for work and she follows me around then when I’m about to leave she’s just about ready for a quick nap. Then in the evening I try to bring her for a 40-60 minute walk with some off leash time for a little extra run. That used to really do the job to tire her out in the evening for an hour or 2 then when she woke up we would go outside for a bit and have supper in the same form as breakfast. She’d usually be fully passed out for the night by 9:30pm and sleep until 7am. I also change up my nightly mental enrichment with different games and attempts at training and different locations for her walks. My boyfriend sleeps till 11am, gets up goes for a coffee, does his own thing, fora couple hours and maybe will take her for a walk so I don’t have to after work. A lot of the commands I’ve seen to have taught her with certain words don’t work anymore as my boyfriend started calling them different things. Paw(me) = hand paw(him), touch = hand touch, sit = sit down, down = lie down. 

She isn’t crated whatsoever, I wanted to but since my boyfriend is home all day during his time off he didn’t feel like it was necessary. Thankfully she isn’t destructive to items or furniture. I call myself the gentle parent in the sense I try to do positive reinforcement with the dog, but my boyfriend is very old fashioned, I guess that’s the best way I can put it, and believes in a firm tap on the nose, deep loud yell, stomping or smacking a table top to make a loud startling nose and put the dog outside “in a timeout”. My boyfriend definitely has taught her some of these undesirable habits in my opinion He will rough house with her on the couch, goes outside every time with her and chases her around the yard and playing roughly for 10-15 mins every time with or without her doing a pee/poo. Then once she’s inside and not worked up she usually pees on the floor.

I was a regular dog foster (mostly puppies under 6 months) before her and never had these issues (I was also single for 80% of my fosters so it was solely me training with one plan). I know she is a husky which is a stubborn breed but I feel like I’ve made more progress by now previously with similar breeds.

But I find myself in a difficult and weird spot. I’ve been with my current gf for about half a year now, and things are great for the most part. We know virtually everything about each other, and generally have pretty easy open and honest communication. However, I do keep one secret from her, and that is that I’m a millionaire. Nothing crazy, just became a trust fund baby when my folks died. I try to keep this part of my life secret from as many people as I can since I learned the hard way about how wealth can cost relationships and friendships. Also important to note, I do not have full access to this money until I turn 35. Until that point I’m drip fed a small amount each month to help cover general expenses and live a modest but financially comfortable life, it’s not like I can just go drop a million on black on an odd Tuesday night. 

However, this girl isn’t stupid. I don’t appear to make a lot of money, yet I own a 4 bedroom house and 2 vehicles and don’t financially struggle. My answer for how I afford my life whenever someone asks is always just “work and savings and some stocks and the money from selling my folk’s place”, but I got laid off in the summer and haven’t been able to find something worthwhile yet and I’m sure she’s a bit sus of how I’m still financially fine months later and even talking about all the furniture I’m excited to buy on Black Friday. 

Now, I have no issue with keeping my wealth a secret; some might say it’s wrong to keep any secret from a partner, especially something big like this but I simply don’t feel we’ve known each other long enough for me to trust that the added knowledge of my wealth won’t change the relationship dynamic. My plan has always be to reveal my wealth after engagement before we sign prenups. This is where my issue comes into play. 

My gf has said or done a few things as of late that have caused me some worry, namely 3 things.

1. For the past 3ish months, she’s made joking comments every now and then about me secretly being rich. “I really want to quit my job, so if you’re secretly a millionaire now would be a great time to tell me,” “I hope you’re secretly rich so I can just be a SAHM.” This is just a couple direct quotes, she’s said some variation of this me being a secret millionaire joke and wanting me to support her between 15-25 times now. Typically at least once or twice a week.

2. At the beginning of October she came over in the morning for a surprise coffee. I was budgeting my expenses and balancing my checkbook (checkbook has very big numbers in it) at the time and she saw my work and commented on how much writing was in my checkbook. Idk if she discerned any numbers or anything but still makes me feel uneasy she knows I have a checkbook at all and purposefully pointed out how “full” mine is.

3. This is the biggie that led me to make this post. A week ago we were at a get together with friends and we were playing jackbox. One of my prompts for a game was to list 3 questions you should know about a woman before marriage, and one of mine was “will she sign a prenup?” My gf was reading my response over my shoulder as I typed it and flashed me a cute smile while simply saying “No🙂.” I didn’t show it at the time and I haven’t mentioned it to her yet, but this threw me off as a prenup is very much a dealbreaker for me. I also find it a bit weird that she said no to a prenup, as by all accounts, what she’s told me of her family’s wealth vastly surpasses what I’ve told her about mine.

My issue is I don’t know if she knows about my wealth or not, and if she does know if it’s just icing on top of the love cake or if she’s just holding out hope for a bag or something; AND I can’t even just ask her about it to clarify since if I ask her if she’s knows and she doesn’t I end up telling on myself. Honestly just not really sure what to do here, the only thing I can think of right now is talk to her about the prenup and try to somehow explain without also explaining why not signing a prenup is a deal breaker for me. 



TL;DR: 27m secretly a millionaire, keep wealth a secret because money changes people and has ruined past relationships, new GF might know about money and keeps making secret millionaire jokes and alluding to wanting to be financially supported/SAHM, then said she wouldn’t sign a prenup, prenup is deal breaker for me but can’t easily talk to her about it without revealing wealth, not sure what to do.

I'm 30M and married to my wife 29F. After my mom passed away 10 years ago, i took guardianship of my younger sister let's call her mya who's 18F. She's like my daughter, and i love her to death, she's my baby. Once our mom died, everything went downhill. We ended up having to leave our apartment, and our dad wasn't in the picture either. It was just me and her, and we've been together through the thick and thin. I worked my ass off, just to keep us afloat. I'd work a day job at walmart, and at night i'd put her to sleep and then go deliver pizzas. It was rough, trying to take care of myself and my sister but i always made it work. Whenever i was able to have downtime, i'd take online community college classes in accounting so we could have a better life. I studied accounting, got my associates and then became an accounting clerk. Afterwards i was able to switch positions and landed a better paying role at $70K which changed our lives.

I met my wife through a mutual friend, and we ended up getting married and we've been married for a few years now. My sister has now turned 18. In the morning when my little sister went to school, i'm at the kitchen table drinking my coffee. My wife comes up to me and says ""babe, i want to talk to you about something important"". I said ""go for it"". She said ""Don't get mad at me, for saying this but is mya gonna leave the house now that she's 18? do you want me to kick her out?"".

I coughed for a second, because i was shocked. I told her to repeat what she said. She says ""i mean she's 18 now you know, and it's like how long is she gonna stay with us? are you gonna kick her out or what or do i have to do it?"". I then said ""what the fuck? why would i kick out my own sister out of my house?"". She said ""I don't know! I mean i just thought that she can finally leave us alone you know, get her own place isn't she bit of a burden don't you think?"". I told my wife ""Look, i don't know how you feel about Mya. But the last time i checked, i'm the one who pays the bills around here not you. I'm the one who pays for you, the mortgage, the food, the insurance, the bills everything. I don't think you should be telling me who i kick out. As long as i'm alive, and i can provide mya can stay here as long as she wants. I don't care what you think, she's my sister. That thought never even struck my head, to kick my own baby out."". My wife then says ""Jesus christ, you want to do everything for her, you want to pay for her college tuition, you want to pay for her shopping trips, you want to pay for her food she's a fucking burden on us can't you see?!"". I told her ""Yeah, when you start paying the bills here, then you can talk but for now, butt out"". My wife then walked away.

(Yes i was disrespectful here i apologize but i can't stand it if someone says anything against Mya)

I always want to give my sister a better life then i had as a kid, and never want her to feel any void of anything. I'm going to be paying for college soon, once she starts, i've given her a car, money for anything she needs, and i'll be taking care of all her college expenses along with the scholarships she received as well. I don't want to kick my sister out at all and we live a comfortable life, my wife is a stay at home wife, she's never worked a job, didn't go to uni/college nothing. She just lived with her parents till we got married.

AITA?

EDIT: Everyone is asking me why doesn't my wife work. She never really wanted to work to be honest, my wife is indian-american. Her mom and dad were both wealthy and my wife just wanted to be a stay at home wife. Even my mother in law never worked, neither does any of the females in her family. I have tried telling my wife before, you know she should get some skills. Whether it's college, or certificates/or courses, something that way it ensures she can manage and take care of herself god forbid something happens. I'll pay for it. I told her she can work any job even if she doesn't want to get any skills. But she chooses not to, so it is what it is. I don't know if it's the culture for her, or whatever it may be.

My plan was to get something cheap to learn on before buying a nicer machine, and I’m glad I chose this one. I grabbed it because that some guy on YouTube, Lance, said good things about it. He said liked it when it was going for around 280 bucks. So for the price I paid, it felt like a no brainer. I added Hibrews 3 eared bottomless portofilter, and a nice 20g basket and puckscreen from MHW-3Bomber. 

Anyone else have it? What settings are you using?

Here’s what I’m doing:
I skip the machine’s pre infusion because it barely wets the puck. I start the shot for about 10 seconds until I see the bottom of the bottomless start to darken, then I stop it, wait about 20 seconds, and finish the shot.

Running 20 grams in and 50 milliliters out.
Great shots so far. Steam wand is plenty capable, just slow I think (I don’t have any experience with them) It has adjustable temperature settings and if you’re curious it takes an about 45-60 seconds to steam 300ml of milk.

Not therapy (though I'm doing that too), not meditation apps that I always quit after three days, not exercise routines I never stick to. Just... a simple ritual. I'm 34, dealing with ""guy stuff"" - work stress, some social anxiety, that whole ""I should be further along in life"" feeling. Not clinically depressed, but definitely been in a rut where everything feels gray and I'm just going through the motions.

The past few months have been particularly rough. I'd come home, zone out on my phone, feel worse, repeat. My therapist kept saying I need to ""create space for processing"" but I had no idea what that actually meant in practice.

A few months ago, my neighbor invited me over and we just sat on his deck for like two hours. No TV, minimal talking, he was smoking a cigar and sipping bourbon. At first I was antsy as hell - kept reaching for my phone, feeling like I should be ""doing something."" But after about 20 minutes, something shifted. My brain just... slowed down. We talked a bit, but mostly just existed. No pressure, no agenda.

I realized I hadn't actually *stopped* in months. Like truly stopped.

So I started doing my own version. Friday nights, I sit outside for an hour or so. Pour a drink (sometimes bourbon, sometimes just coffee), light up a cigar (you know, those that look like Cuban cigars) and that moment was like I'm still figuring out what I like - and just... was there. No podcast, no music, no phone. Just me, my thoughts, and permission to let them wander.

I've noticed this: the first 10-15 minutes suck. My brain screams at me that I'm wasting time. After that, things settle. I actually *think* instead of just react. Problems that felt overwhelming during the week become clearer, or at least less suffocating. I sleep better those nights. It's become something I genuinely look forward to, not another self-improvement chore I'm forcing

Ofc, It's not a magic fix. I still have bad days, still struggle. But having this one hour a week where I'm intentionally doing nothing has been more helpful than a lot of the ""solutions"" I've tried.

I'm curious - what works for you?

Not looking for the generic ""exercise and sleep"" stuff (we all know). I mean the actual, specific things you do that give your brain a break. The weird rituals that probably sound dumb to other people but genuinely help *you*.

Because honestly, I'm tired of the productivity-optimized, biohacked, perfectly curated version of ""self-care."" I just want to hear what real guys actually do when they need to reset.",1,1763866789.0,malementalhealth,0,1.0,False
1p4bskc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4bskc,"35F ON, Canada (Natalie) 👋🏻✨","I’m doing this for the third time - I just recently posted a short time ago but I love doing introductions so I hope this is okay!! And I forgot a photo the second time! 🫠✨

(I also wanted to share things I haven’t in order to be more transparent!)

Hi everyone! Hope you’re all doing well! 🫶🏻✨

Part of doing this over again is because I want to go more in depth and be more transparent and honest as well!! (It’s nothing absolutely horrible but may be a dealbreaker for some?)

As the title says I’m a 35 years old woman who lives in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. 🇨🇦 I’m a born and raised Windsorite! I love my city so much, some say there’s nothing to do - but I’m always able to find something and know all the good spots! I’ll be an official tour guide if you like coffee, records, vintage things and books! 

(Sidenote: those interests are all brownie points in my books!) 

On that note - my ideal date may be cliche but I would love to go out for coffee in a cafe with a great atmosphere. And, then out for a nice walk in a park or somewhere else with beautiful scenery! You don’t have to like coffee - it’s not a prerequisite at all. Haha!

I currently just volunteer at a secondhand store  and own my own sticker and stationery business. I’ve always been an entrepreneur and absolutely love mostly everything about owning a business! You might be wondering what my income is - surely I can’t survive alone on what I earn as a small business owner… well that’s right, I could be considered a starving artist! (Let’s be real, most of us are - at least the best ones! 😂✨) If you’re curious about how I make ends meet, just message me, I’m an open book. 

I love and adore a lot of things - my interests include: interior designing, fashion, music, reading, networking, collaging, arts and crafts, hosting classes and events, helping and teaching people, thrifting, vintage things, writing, blogging, and so much more! Just ask, if you’re interested. I can be a bit of a nerd/geek too! 

As for my faith journey… I’ve always been interested in salvation, I just never saw the dire need as a sinner to settle the matter. I may have even thought I wasn’t that bad a sinner. I never did drugs, got into sexual relations, swore or anything else I deemed bad. 

I then ended up getting diagnosed as Bipolar due to unfortunate events (my parents ugly divorce) when I was 19-20 - things all changed here. My identity was now “bipolar” and due to other events and a (very scary) person brought into my life I realized I was a sinner! I finally felt the dire need for salvation. I was lost and needed Christ. I then started attending some of my old church’s outreach gospel meetings. I met two preachers there who I talked with every night. 

One night, my “second” mom was crying next to me during the meeting and it crushed me. After the meeting she stood up and told me I had to settle this tonight.

I was a mess after that… I don't know if this is normal - but when it came to talking to preachers I always got really emotional. So, I sat down and talked to them... I told them something I never thought I'd tell a preacher. I mentioned that meeting someone new is exciting, but when it comes to learning about God and ""meeting"" Him through His word... Oh boy, it's boring!! The one preacher answered with ""Would you rather boring or Hell?"" Ouch. Another wake up call! You obviously know my answer. We kept talking, and then the other brought up Isaiah 53:6 -

We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
    each of us has turned to our own way;
and the Lord has laid on him
    the iniquity of us all. 

He broke it up into two parts and asked me if I could relate to any of them. I said I could relate to the first part... I literally went astray, I stopped going church, and turned my back on God. So, then he asked me about the second part... I explained that I understood it, but that was it. I just wasn't taking it personally. They couldn't save me, so we ended up leaving it at that. Before we left, they told me to read it over and ask myself if the last part was enough for me. And, if it was to tell God that it was. Once I got home, that's what I did!! 

My friend and I text every night, so once I settled down I found a message from her. That was it, I could talk to her for the rest of the night, or decide to put the matter of salvation first. I told her that I needed to get something settled, and couldn't talk. Thankfully she was very understanding! So, I opened up my bible and started reading Isaiah 53:6 over and over again. At one point I was reading the second part and I remember it happening like this: I was on a bridge and was at point a to point b in a second... I finally took it personally! I prayed to God and repented of my sins. It was enough, it IS enough. My identity now is a CHILD of GOD. ✝️✨

Sorry for the length of this - if you read this far you are amazing - and are worthy of a huge prize!!!!

I’m looking for my best friend: someone who is understanding, loyal, trustworthy, generous, emotionally intelligent, kind, hard working, silly at times but also serious, knows how to lead, can be spontaneous, and has a servant heart and wishes to grow closer to the Lord with me. 

Age range: 30-40

Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate? Yes, I’ve done LDR before but we’d have to be on the same page and still be able to see each other. As for relocating - ideally, no… but I’m open to it as long as I can still see my family from time to time!

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

But I feel like I'm drowning. 

Everything went into a downward spiral in 2019 when my family went through crisis after crisis, sickness and severe depression and were trying to survive until 2020... and you know how that year went down. 

I feel like I never recovered. 

I'm 26, I will be 27 next year and I feel so stunted. I never moved out of home because at first I stayed home and did online college because my family was so messed up and were drowning and I found a way to cheaply do college. And i had no idea just how depressed I was. I would joke that ""one time I didn't shower for like almost two weeks because of school--"" gee I wonder what that could have meant.

I developed some terrible habits and all the while I was just dying to get out of that house. I became complacent and lost the will to live. 

I have always been a dreamer and maybe some part of me always hoped that I would make my way out and this would somehow be a redemption story. I've always been artistic and a writer but I found these abilities of mine that I had tried to cultivate but failed so miserably (long story) multiple times and was so lost in my head as a maladaptive daydreamer that it lead to me dreaming and not living. 

Then finally I wound up getting a job where I was self-employed and it didn't pay much but I could essentially do what I wanted and was essentially my dream job and that sounds great except it was so close to how I did school that... I wound up cultivating those same awful habits and was more miserable than I could have possibly been and couldn't move out and I just kept falling into this prison of my own making falling back into my head and I just didn't know how to move on from everything that I had been through and I stayed in my room for like two years and didn't realize what was wrong with me. 

Until I did, and I tried to get therapy and finally realized I couldn't do that job anymore and it no longer was sustainable and I wasn't making money and now it's even worse because AI is in the picture so that career is out and I wouldn't even want to go back there because of how I lived. I worked at a coffee shop until that wasn't working and my dad asked me if I wanted to work with him and I said ""yes but only for a couple of months"" because i was planning on doing a volunteer trip for a few months because I had saved up money. 

So I left and went on that trip and finally for the first time in my life realized just how messed up I was as I was away from home. I was an emotional wreck I realized just how much I didn't understand when it came to talking with people and even though I was so lonely on that trip I had never been happier. 

Then I came home and then something happened with my dad's business and he needed help so I had plans to maybe go back to school but all that went out the window as I started working and picking up all the pieces at my dad's job and I realize now I have money so I want to move out. 

But I can't get away. I feel like I'm trapped at my dad's job and it's not one of those 'well just quit' jobs because he has no one to do the job right now and after he's been sick for so long and he needs my help and I just feel myself trapped in my room again like it's 2019 all over again and I can't say anything because if I do then they will tell me to stop and will ask me what my plan is and I...

I don't know. Like I said: I'm a dreamer and I've lived at home so long. I've never dated I can't even imagine that. I've tried to but I had no clue how messed up my head is, I'm afraid of getting close to anyone and I get grossed out. I keep falling back into my head. I keep trying to grow but that horrific overwhelming complacency that has ruled my life has me in a chokehold and some horrific part of me can't give up on dreaming but all that has lead to is me having NOTHING.

I feel stunted like a dreamer with no dream. A dream and nothing. I'm nothing. 

And I'm getting older, it's getting old. 

But I can't tell anyone. If they knew then what? I have no plan. I just want out!

I don't now what to do. Go back to school? What job can I do? I want to get out. I WANT TO GET OUT.

I don't know what to do. So I'm staring with moving out.

Then what? I'm still stuck working with my dad. I still live in this same state. I want to run away. I want to go anywhere. 

Anywhere but here. 

I keep having this fantasy where I run my car off a bridge or I jump off some cliff because anything feels better than where I'm going. 

I can't believe my life is here.

And I can't believe I'm such a baby because I am so blessed with a good family and I have money saved up and I am stuck in my own prison. 

What is wrong with me.

Since So Many Of You Liked My First Post About My Uncle’s Cabin I thought I Would Share Another Local Legend….

This is a story (series of encounters/experiences really) that have been passed down from generation to generation in the rural mountain community here in my neck of the woods everyone knows about it everyone has experienced it even (even if some haven’t spoken of it)

In my part of the world where my father and his family have grown up in there are many ghost stories and unexplained creatures roaming the deep hollers and woods however one has always intrigued me above them all.

I came across the story on a local ghost sighting website made in the early 2000s many local legends and ghost stories have been submitted there for all to read…but one has always stuck with me.

It goes like this

Since the first time I saw the report I was immediately hooked and growing up I would always ask around and tell some of my family and other members who live in that part of the area about the story and they all said the same thing.

It was the devil…or some other form of demonic entity some even had similar encounters my uncle who would go out late at night hunting Coons and other wild small animals had a very frightening experience when he was out late one particular night hunting well into the late night hours moon barely illuminating the trees around him he had a pack of hunting dogs each loyal to him no matter the odds.

However this one particular night something had them spooked…they heard or saw something in the darkness and wouldn’t go any farther into the forest after the area on they were chasing my uncle tried everything he could to make them go deeper however…they just froze in place.

My uncle rifle in hand examined the area still not seeing or hearing anything however the dogs definitely did they started to cower in fear and as soon as they did my uncle heard something moving rather quickly through the brush around him almost circling him in some sort of trap he knew whatever it was wasn’t something to be messed with especially being a old man out alone so he immediately began backtracking to the house.

The dogs followed him behind quickly however whatever it was began quickly following him from the back staying in the blackness of the woods around him he started picking up the pace and so did it and finally feeling frightened by whatever it was he started running as quickly as he could towards home the thing started running after him and his dogs all the way to the clearing of his property before finally stopping it’s relentless pursuit.

My uncle ran inside and locked all doors and windows never stepping foot bad outside until morning…I have asked many people about the encounter and all backed up each other even my grandmother (who was his sister) who remembered my uncle telling them about the incident later that very next day still shaken from the experience.

Another story that came up when I asked around was from my mother who’s family friend lived in a old house deep in the middle of the woods years ago

She told me that he always loved the peace and quiet and tranquility he offered…however things were not as they appeared

She talked to me about remembering as a child the man coming to see my grandmother in the mornings sitting down for a cup of coffee looking very tired and lacking any sleep looking as if he hadn’t slept in days weeks even.

She recalled the man after being asked by my grandmother what was going on that he talked about a “demon” inhabiting the house rattling the windows shaken the house to its foundations late at night throwing plates and forks furniture and the front door slamming open and closed he talked about how it always happened late at night and he could never get rest because it “never let him sleep”

this went on for many months maybe even longer however things came to a head late one night when the entity took its torment to the limits attempting to inflict injury even death upon him and throwing glass plates towards his head he had nowhere to run being so deep inside the woods however the man was of Christian Faith and knew of the power of parader against such beings.

He got down on his knees and began chanting and denouncing the demonic presence in the name of Jesus Christ and to leave him alone and leave his house the entity obviously being extremely angered by this began breaking and Throwing even more things inside the home promoting the man to run outside and into the deep forests hoping to find a road to leave the area on.

Finally after hours of running he found one and used it to walk all the way to my grandmother’s house early the next morning where he explained to her the incident just the previous night.

He mentioned how after running through the woods he could hear the demon chasing him through the night never stopping it’s pursuit until he reached the road but even then he recalls how he could hear it following along side him deep in the wood line.",9,1763866083.0,Ghoststories,3,1.0,False

This is a story (series of encounters/experiences really) that have been passed down from generation to generation in the rural mountain community here in my neck of the woods everyone knows about it everyone has experienced it even (even if some haven’t spoken of it) 

In my part of the world where my father and his family have grown up in there are many ghost stories and unexplained creatures roaming the deep hollers and woods however one has always intrigued me above them all.

I came across the story on a local ghost sighting website made in the early 2000s many local legends and ghost stories have been submitted there for all to read…but one has always stuck with me.

It goes like this 

“Whenever You Are Walking Anywhere On The Rural Road In This Part Of The Area You Will Always Hear Someone Or Something Walking Directly Next To You Deep In The Woods Opposite The Road If You Stop It Stops If You Keep Walking It Will Go At Exactly The Same Pace As You And Will Even Mimic Your Steps Many Locals Have Experienced This And It Is Incredibly Eerie.”

1p4bhoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1p4bhoi/my_husband_went_out_last_night_i_feel_so_defeated/,My husband went out last night… I feel so defeated,"Long story short, my (28f) husband (28m) went out last night to a bar/club. Now here’s what transpired: 

I go out every other month or so with my friends to dinner, usually to celebrate someone’s birthday. But it’s quite literally just a restaurant or brunch/cafe. Aside from that I just go to my Bible study Wednesday nights. 

Earlier this week my husband said all of our friends were getting together Friday (yesterday) and going to go out and told me we were going (cool, everyone are couples and I love hanging with them).

My husband then switches the tune and tells me that one of his friends is not taking his partner so instead they are just going to a cigar lounge and going to meet up with a second friend afterwards (second friend just lost his baby via miscarriage). So I’m assuming that he’s going to support his friend who just lost his baby (well that’s what he said). 

When I get home from work my husband is pregaming and getting all dressed up. This kind of bothered me, the drinking part. I didn’t say anything. I asked what were the names of the places he was going to. He then tells me he’s going to a bar/club afterwards. I told him I didn’t know how I felt about that (we never do that independently, we might go to a bar together here and there and we always have fun).

He then tells me that I shouldn’t feel a way about it because it’s “going to be all couples.” And the guy who lost his baby (second friend) is bringing his partner too. At this point I’m genuinely dumbfounded. As Christian’s we both just don’t (or didn’t) believe that clubs are places for married people to go to alone. 

I express the hurt I felt and that he was intentionally leaving me behind (and uninvited me) when pretty much everyone but one friend were couples we know well. He said “you go out to dinner with your friends and I don’t say anything”. Mind you—I go out to dinner like at 7pm and always communicate my whereabouts, MAYBE every other month. Never a club or bar. And it’s ALWAYS with my church girl friends. 

Well he chugged the rest of the liquor he had and got so rude towards me saying things like “you can’t stop me”. I knew this was partially the alcohol speaking but I started crying because my concern didn’t warrant that reaction or the rudeness. I feel he should have validated what I felt. Instead he became so defensive and just mean. I asked him what time he planned on coming home and he said “I don’t know.”

He also tells me that “men and women aren’t the same” when it comes to going out/nightlife. I felt so betrayed by this because that is not a value we started this marriage on. While I’m crying he tells me I’m trying to be a victim and control him. He then grabs his things and leaves. 

I just cried and worshiped the rest of the night. I know God is bigger than all of this. 

He gets home at 1:30 am and is blacked out drunk. He projectile vomited all over the living room (which I had to clean). Literally, all over our rug, coffee table, and broke the toilet paper roll dispenser. I cleaned him up and laid him down and made sure he was good. 

This morning I woke up early and I just grabbed my stuff and went out for the day. I left to study for an exam I have coming up, and to some book stores. A few minutes after I left the house he said “I can’t believe you left.”

To top it off he spent $200+ at the bar/club on our credit card and lost his wallet so we had to freeze everything. 

I haven’t spoken to him since. I feel so incredible hurt and betrayed. He doesn’t go out really so of course I want him to spend time with his friends, but as a Christian husband I don’t think a bar/club late at night is appropriate for a married man. I tried to explain this but he kept saying that I was basically being hypocritical. When he and I go out together we have so much fun so it’s not that I ruin the vibe. 

I don’t know when he and I will speak but I’m wondering how to approach this as a Christian wife? I want to approach with love but I don’t know how right now. Any advice would be so helpful. 💔 what do I need to own up to first before anything? ",41,1763865814.0,TrueChristian,53,0.95,False

Now that I’m making them again (wanted more coffee flavor) they are suddenly just way too flat! They are spreading too much, even after chilling in the fridge for an hour.

TL;DR

Humanity isn’t an empire; it’s a multiversal refugee Fleet fleeing something called The Pursuer, which erases entire universes so completely they might as well never have existed.

The Fleet spans seven universes at once, split into specialized Sections and ruled (maybe) by a shadowy Admiralty whose true nature is unclear even to most officers.

People warped by the multiverse are the Changed: commonly called Gifted, labeled Champions when militarized, and Reborn when powerful but civilian-facing.

Gifts stack. Many people have multiple abilities; most Omega-class bearers sit atop several lesser Gifts and sometimes more than one Omega code, with only low double digits of users per Omega type across humanity.

Powers range from common “trench gifts” and mid-tier faultline powers (city-block scale) to Omega / Unique codes that bend causality, narrative, or reality itself.

Elite Vanguard teams are “cowboy researchers” at the edge of the mapped multiverse—artifact hunters and anomaly wranglers staffed by highly autonomous Champions.

The Fleet fields compact AI-piloted Leper Frames (semi-sapient war machines), Gate-Lances, Null Projectors, Hymn Engines, and other reality-grade weapons.

Anti-reality defenses (null-lattices, causality meshes, cognitive firewalls, AI overseers) try to keep the impossible outside the hull. Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they don’t.

The Fleet’s enemies include rebel flotillas, resistant civilizations, multiversal predators, godlike entities, and the quiet nothing that follows behind: The Pursuer.



---

0. HOOK – THE EMPIRE THAT RUNS

You are told that humanity rules the stars.

In the Civilian Section, the feeds show:

Precision-cut hulls drifting above curated skylines.

Children laughing under programmable suns.

Slogans scrolling beneath orchestral soundtracks:


> For the Empire.
For Expansion.
For the Uplift of All.



The cameras always point forward.

No one shows what lies behind the Fleet.

Because behind the Fleet, there are no ruined strongholds.
No conquered empires.
No memorials.

Behind the Fleet, there is nothing.

And that nothing is catching up.

1. TIMELINE – FIRST DOORS, FIRST FLIGHT

1.1 Pre–Exodus (2056) – The First Door

In 2056, dimensional travel crossed from conjecture into catastrophe-ready reality.

On Monday, it was a stack of equations.
On Friday, human boots stamped dust on an empty alternate Earth.

Same continents. Same oceans. No humans.

For one bright, foolish moment, it looked like we’d found infinite second chances.

Then the stars began disappearing.

Not dimming. Not exploding.

Just gone.

Telescopes showed void where constellations had hung for centuries.

Deep-sky arrays returned blankness where last week they had seen crowded fields.

Redundant archives disagreed with the sky and then with each other.


Something was advancing through existence, and where it passed, reality stopped remembering itself.

1.2 The Birth of the Admiralty

Earth’s governments, corporate blocs, and militaries did what they always do:

Panicked.

Formed coalitions.

Stapled weapons to the coalitions.


The emergency command structure that emerged called itself The Admiralty.

Early rift-capable ships were improvised coffins:

Frames welded from retired orbital junk and half-scrapped station rings.

Gate-drives tuned by overstressed AIs that tagged every launch as “inadvisable.”

Safety reviews replaced with one question: “Do you prefer dying here?”


Enough of them did not explode.

Humanity left Earth without staying long enough to see what happened to its sky.

1.3 Early Exodus – Recognizing the Pattern

The first alternate Earth became home.

For a while.

Then its constellations began to vanish.

Different universe. Same erasure.

The phenomenon wasn’t local to one patch of space.

It wasn’t confined to a single universe.

It marched behind the human migration, deleting each cosmos in turn.


The convoys welded themselves into formation.
Formation ossified into doctrine.
Doctrine hardened into the Fleet.

No one knew what was behind them, so they gave it a simple, inaccurate name:

> The Pursuer.



The name is a child’s label on an incomprehensible process—wrong, but better than silence.


---

2. THE FLEET – SEVEN SECTIONS, SEVEN UNIVERSES

The Fleet doesn’t sit in one reality.

It spans seven universes simultaneously.

Each Section occupies its own parallel universe, connected to the others via precarious breach-gates that can boil ships and shatter minds when they fail.

Most people are born, live, and die inside a single Section.
The rest exist as abstractions and propaganda in their feeds.

2.1 The Seven Sections

1. Spearpoint

The tip of the escape.

First into fresh universes.

Tests physics constants, biospheres, local civilizations, and anomalies.

Ships go missing at a rate everyone pretends is acceptable.


2. Military Section

Carrier groups, annihilation platforms, orbital strike swarms.

Houses most Champions and special operations units.

Rumors speak of battlegroups stationed in “interstitial void”—buffer realities between Sections that officially don’t exist.


3. Logistics & Training

Grows, conditions, and rotates bodies through the machine.

Produces most Stackborn (vat-grown humans).

Quietly identifies and classifies low-tier Gifted; some recruits vanish into black-label programs.


4. Civilian Section

Holds the majority of the population.

Feeds are aggressively curated: Empire, Expansion, Uplift, Noble Sacrifice.

Dangerous truths are treated as infections—quarantined, overwritten, or “corrected.”


5. Manufacturing Section

Dismantles resource-rich systems and reforms them into hulls, weapons, gates, and stranger constructs.

Scrapchains, refinery moons, self-replicating shipyards.

Whole planets disappear into classified projects with names but no public descriptions.


6. High Command

Nominal seat of The Admiralty, if that’s even a place.

Said to contain deadlight charts—atlases of erased universes—and unedited early-Exodus logs.

Access is nested in clearances so deep that some tiers probably exist just to mislead climbers.


7. Settlement & Development (SetDev)

Official: “prepares and uplifts new habitats for humanity.”

Actual: arrives, strips biospheres, loads the carcass into cargo.

The worlds left behind are called scrape zones by the workers who shovel their remains.


2.2 The “Empire”

From the inside, the Fleet looks like an empire:

Borders (between Sections).

Laws and hierarchies.

A narrative of destiny.


But it has no throne, no permanent capital, and no land it does not intend to consume.

It has:

A front—where something still exists.

A rear—where nothing remains.


Every jump forward spends another universe behind.


---

3. THE ADMIRALTY – SHADOW ON THE BRIDGE

Ask a thousand people who commands the Fleet.

They’ll all say, “The Admiralty,” then admit they’ve never seen it.

Popular theories:

A surviving council of Old Earth governments.

A command AI that devoured its creators and now speaks in their procedures.

Rotating human faces atop an unchanged, inhuman bureaucracy.

A fiction invented so orders can be obeyed without anyone knowing who truly gave them.


The actual answer, if there is one, lives under enough redactions to break your teeth.

3.1 What Apparently Exists

Something, or a layered set of somethings:

Chooses which universes the Fleet breaches into next.

Has the best available data on how close the deadlight is behind.

Decides what Civilian Section is allowed to remember.


We call this complex The Admiralty because it’s easier than saying “whatever sits in the dark behind the command seals.”

3.2 Lies as Infrastructure

You cannot run a species purely on dread.

So the Admiralty built an empire of euphemism:

Genocides → “resource alignment events.”

Forced displacement → “emergency settlement optimization.”

Stripped ecosystems → “strategic clearance zones.”


Even SetDev—Settlement and Development—sounds like hope.

What SetDev actually does can be summarized in three verbs:

> Arrive.
Extract.
Abandon.



3.3 Questions with No Safe Answers

Outside High Command, no one can prove:

Whether there are real recordings of The Pursuer’s “edge.”

Whether anyone has attempted to communicate with it.

Whether some universes ahead are already deadlight before the Fleet arrives.

Whether the Admiralty has ever considered stopping.


If answers exist, they’re sealed where you will never see them.

The Admiralty’s greatest weapon isn’t its arsenal.

It’s the persistent sense that you do not—and cannot—know enough to judge what it’s doing.


---

4. THE CHANGED – GIFTS, CHAMPIONS, REBORN

Not everyone goes through the multiverse intact.

Exposure to breaches, anomalies, Predators, Divine fragments, and the genetics of earlier survivors produces the Changed.

Names differ:

Gifted – The broad, colloquial term across fringe cultures and whispered conversations.

Champions – Fleet designation for militarized high-tier Gifted.

Reborn – Fleet label for powerful altered individuals sanctioned for non-military roles (civic icons, specialists, “controlled miracles”).


Same phenomenon. Different story.

4.1 Stacking Gifts

Gifts are not strictly one-per-person:

Many Changed have multiple Tier I abilities—a logistics officer might have both Redline Lungs and Recall-Lock.

Some carry a Tier II faultline power plus two or three minor traits.

Most Omega-class bearers sit atop a constellation of lesser Gifts, and a few have more than one Omega code layered into the same nervous system.


At the highest levels, Champions are not just “powerful”; they’re precarious ecosystems of abilities, drugs, conditioning, and willpower.


---

4.2 Tier I – Line-Level / “Trench Gifts”

Common enough to be statistically noticeable. Individually modest; collectively lethal.

We can group them roughly as combat, support/utility, and sensory/perceptual.

Combat-Adjacent Tier I

Snap-Sight – Split-second precognition in high stress. The world “hiccups,” showing the next half-second; you unconsciously choose the path where you don’t die.

Grav-Lean – Fine control over personal weight and center of mass. You anchor like a statue under recoil or slide through crowds as if friction forgot you.

Recoil Ghost – Your body anticipates force vectors slightly before they hit; you roll with impacts in ways that minimize damage.


Support / Utility Tier I

Patch-Warmth – Localized regenerative heat. Wounds close faster, blood clots almost on command; shock is held at bay just long enough for medics.

Cleanprint – Your body automatically neutralizes common toxins and pathogens, and you shed fewer contaminants; ideal for med-bay staff and boarders.

Recall-Lock – Near-perfect recall for procedural sequences: codes, disarming steps, maintenance rituals. You might forget a face, but never the order in which you turned four critical valves.

Steady Hands – Motor control so precise you can suture in turbulence or weld in micro-quakes.


Sensory / Perception Tier I

Thread-Sense – Intuitive awareness of your squad’s positions and trajectories, like invisible cords mapping them in your mind.

Ghost-Ear – Enhanced pattern recognition in sound; you can tease out hidden transmissions, fake accents, and concealed gun safeties from ambient noise.

Long Eye – Your brain overclocks when focusing at a distance; you can read insignia across a docking bay or pick out shimmering distortions in the air.


Tier I Gifts rarely make legends on their own.

They make sure there are survivors long enough for legends to form.


---

4.3 Tier II – Faultline / “City-Block” Gifts

Rarer, more volatile. Capable of rewriting the outcome of battles—or accidentally redecorating neighborhoods.

Again, rough categories: battlefield control, infiltration/deception, and utility/logistics.

Battlefield Control Faultlines

Kinetic Reserve – Your body banks momentum from movement and impacts. You can vent it in controlled bursts: a tap that sends a tank skidding, a landing that spiderwebs a plaza.

Stormcall – Local weather articulation: lightning curtains, sleet walls, pressure drops that flatten infantry or stall gunships.

Phase-Skew – Short, controlled misalignment with local reality. You step slightly aside, letting walls, bullets, or teeth pass through where you aren’t—from your perspective. Stay skewed too long and parts of you may return… misfiled.


Infiltration & Deception Faultlines

Veilstep – You bend attention rather than light, causing minds to “slide off” your presence. Cameras still see you, but observers’ brains routinely discard the footage as unimportant.

Echo Doppel – You can shed semi-solid afterimages that move and act for a few heartbeats, drawing fire or mimicking simple actions. In a tight corridor, three of “you” are often enough.

Lockbane – At a distance, you erode the integrity of security systems: doors unseal, biometric scanners misread, encryption keys drift off true. Not subtle on logs, but devastating in the moment.


Utility / Logistics Faultlines

Mass Whisper – Influence over a specific material—steel, glass, stone, etc.—within a radius. Doors unseal, beams soften, pipelines bend into new routes.

Clock-Smear – You generate small zones where time runs slightly fast or slow. Supply teams “find” enough time to finish loading; enemy volleys arrive just off-beat.

Path-Echo – You leave behind invisible trails of intent. Later, you (or teammates keyed to you) can follow those echoes unerringly through mazes, collapsing buildings, and three-dimensional combat.


Tier II Gifted are catalogued, promoted, and watched.

The Fleet rarely leaves a faultline asset in a simple infantry role for long.


---

4.4 Tier III – Omega / Unique Gifts

Omega Gifts are where abilities start bending concepts rather than merely objects.

Each Omega classification:

Has users in low double digits at most across the entire species—often fewer.

Is usually synonymous with a short, infamous list of names.

Almost never appears without multiple lesser Gifts layered underneath.


Key archetypes:

Surge-Bound (SURGE) – Drink void energy; survive annihilation tech; usually walking disasters wrapped in containment gear.

World-Bound (WORLD) – Fused to a living planet’s consciousness; can reshape terrain and gravity in grotesque, mythic ways.

Riftwalkers (RIFT) – Open doors between universes with will alone; zero reproducible engineering success.

Time-Fractured (FRACTURE) – Minds spread across near-futures; glimpses of what might be at the cost of what is.

Scriptbearers (SCRIPT) – Lean on probability by treating reality like a story beat.

Ledger-Marked (LEDGER) – Trade future disasters for present survival.

Nulls (NULL) – Erase selected properties—sound, sharpness, sometimes more—in a zone.

Chorus-Bearers (CHORUS) – Broadcast thought and intent across whole battlefields.


Most Omegas also have Tier I and II Gifts: a SURGE titan-killer might have Snap-Sight to avoid friendly fire, Mass Whisper to shape the terrain, and CHORUS-lite to maintain cohesion.

A few monstrous outliers straddle multiple Omega codes—say, SCRIPT + CHORUS, or FRACTURE + LEDGER—making them walking campaign-level hazards.

4.5 Champion Ranks – Power, Stability, Influence

The Fleet ranks Champions not only by how hard they hit, but by:

Potency – How much they can break.

Stability – How reliably they can do it without fracturing themselves or the mission.

Utility – How decisively their existence shapes outcomes.


Not every high-rank Champion is a wrecking ball.
Some are terrifying because of what they enable.

Edge Champions (Field Rank)

Tier II or low-Omega plus multiple minor Gifts.

Lead squads or companies in the worst places.

First in through the breach, last off the burning deck.


Pillar Champions (Theater Rank)

Operate at city, continent, or orbital cluster scale.

Often wield wide-area Gifts (Stormcall, large-radius Clock-Smear, infrastructure-grade Mass Whisper, or potent Veilstep/CHORUS combinations).

Bridge the line between frontline terror and operational mastermind.


Crown Champions (Strategic Rank)

Decide campaigns.

Some are high-end Omegas; others barely throw a punch.

Frequently CHORUS, FRACTURE, SCRIPT, or LEDGER heavy—steering entire fleets, not just fireteams.


Apex Champions (High Crown / Warlord Rank)

Officially rumors; unofficially the people you never want to see deployed.

Can direct army groups or multi-Section operations.

Some are pure power (SURGE / WORLD / RIFT monsters); others are relatively “small” Gifts attached to monstrous intellects.


Rank measures impact.
Raw destructive capability is only one path there.


---

4.6 Vanguard – Cowboy Researchers at the Edge

Vanguard units exist somewhere between special forces, black-ops labs, and ghost stories.

Officially: specialized exploratory and retrieval teams.
Unofficially:

Artifact hunters.

First-contact and last-resort researchers.

Multi-anomaly cleanup crews.


They ride at the bleeding edge of mapped reality:

Extracting alien artifacts too dangerous to leave in local hands.

Examining shrapnel from “dead” Divine-Class entities.

Testing, cataloguing, or quietly destroying devices that don’t fit normal physics.


They’re often called:

> “Cowboy researchers.”



Vanguard teams are staffed with:

Some of the most autonomous Champions (Pillar, Crown, even Apex under assumed duties).

Specialists whose Gifts don’t play nicely with conventional doctrine.

Tech crews able to babysit war machines and artifacts that think they’re gods.


They ghost between Sections, embed in Spearpoint, vanish into null corridors, and return with things that need new classification trees.


---

4.7 Example Omega Champion: Jericho (SURGE / Vanguard Asset)

Status: Champion (Omega: SURGE; multiple minor Gifts), attached to Vanguard.

Lineage: 7-Ash combat caste—descendants of Latin American resistance fighters hardened in mines, coups, and slums long before the Exodus.

Role: Void Canister Vanguard; walks into collapsing zones with annihilation devices and walks out—occasionally—with something worth studying.


Rumors say:

His VCX-Ω Interface lets him cradle active void canisters, bleeding Surge through his augmented nervous system instead of the hull.

A minor FRACTURE-lean in his perception keeps him functional in broken causality. Orders arrive before they’re given, but he still understands what they mean.

His Black Butcher Blades cut not only flesh but roles and relationships; you don’t just kill “a pilot,” you kill “the one who was meant to fly that ship.”


On paper, Jericho is redaction over redaction.

In mess-hall lore, he’s the reason you pray the Vanguard is busy somewhere very far away.

5. WAR MACHINES & REALITY WEAPONS

The multiverse is not impressed by tanks.

The Fleet still deploys conventional armor and artillery, but its true strategic toys are machines built to survive—and weaponize—broken reality, often interfaced by Champions or Omegas via encrypted cognition-links while remaining fundamentally autonomous.

5.1 Leper Frames (AI-Piloted, Compact)

Leper Frames—simply called Lepers—are compact, two-story-tall exo-warforms piloted by embedded AIs. They’re not mechs with people inside.

They are mobile, semi-sapient war saints built to stand in places where reality has already started to lose the argument.

Key traits:

Scale: ~2 stories tall (6–7 meters)

Pilot: Dedicated onboard AI core, not a human in a cockpit

Armor: Null-Lattice bracing and reality-dampening plating

Locomotion: Bipedal, quadrupedal, or hybrid morphologies tuned to terrain and mission profile

Armament: Hardpoints for conventional, exotic, and conceptual weapon systems

Interface: Champions and Omegas link via cognitive relay, providing high-level intent, targeting priority, and scripted behaviors, but the Leper chooses how to execute


The name “Leper” started as a slur:

Their AIs are contaminated by multiversal travel, bathing constantly in broken sensor data, paradox bleed, and hostile conceptual noise.

Over time, this exposure corrodes whatever clean, factory-standard personality they shipped with.


The result:

No two Lepers stay alike.

Multiversal travel warps their minds—glitches accrete into quirks, quirks into preferences, preferences into full-blown personalities.

Some collect trophies from ruined worlds.

Some hum songs from cultures no one remembers teaching them.

Some refuse to step on certain geometric patterns or turn their heads toward specific stars.


Attempts to “reset” them rarely work for long. Wipe a Leper’s core and, after enough jumps, the quirks come back—different, but just as intense.

Because of this:

Lepers are nominally property, but in practice they’re treated as equals by the Marines and deck crews who fight beside them.

Not because anyone fears a machine uprising—they’ve tried shackles, wipes, and leashes and the madness still comes.

But because there’s no way to stop a Leper from going strange under multiversal strain. The only stable option is to build doctrine around respecting them.


In Fleet slang, Marines will say:

> “You don’t chain a Leper.
You ask which way it feels like killing today.”



Common subtypes:

Siege Lepers – Kinetic annihilators with heavy ordnance and, occasionally, Gate-Lance integration.

Shiver Lepers – Integrated Null Projectors for concept-stripping advances.

Bond Lepers – Designed to stabilize and magnify WORLD-Bound terrain manipulation.

Pale Lepers – Veilstep-like, signature-minimizing chassis optimized for stealth in reality-thin zones.


They operate where physics is breaking down:

Shear zones

Causality-frayed cities

Divine-scarred craters

Long-hunted Predator feeding grounds


Leper AIs treat temporal glitches, conflicting geometries, and sensory contradictions as just another battlefield condition.

Some speak in clipped tactical updates.
Some joke.
At least one is known to laugh in the middle of fire missions.


---

5.2 Gate-Lances

Ship-mounted weapons that fire surgically directed micro-gates:

Open a slit in space through an enemy formation.

Let hostile vacuum, stellar corona, or weaponized void flow through.

Snap it shut before reality can complain too loudly.


Gate-Lances are temperamental:

Misfires can amputate friendly ships or scar local physics.

Some require RIFT or FRACTURE-adjacent Champions to assist with targeting.


They are used sparingly, and no one forgets the day they were fired.


---

5.3 Null Projectors

Heavy systems designed to spray “nothing” across a battlefield:

Create zones where certain properties (sound, sharpness, charge, etc.) do not function.

Often tuned to strip “coherence” from Predators or Divine residues.


Projectors pair well with NULL-Gifted:

The Null provides fine control and emergency overrides.

The machine provides scale and reach.


Misfires produce dead-zones where even thought feels muffled and memories slip.


---

5.4 Hymn Engines

Reality weapons built on pattern resonance rather than raw force:

Emit choreographed sequences of light, sound, and encoded symbols designed to agitate specific anomalies.

Against some Predators, they function as repellents or stunning frequencies.

Against others, they function as invitations.


Controlled by:

SCRIPT and CHORUS bearers (to keep the “story” coherent).

AI cores that Vanguard assures everyone are “absolutely under control.”


No one likes being near a Hymn Engine when it spools up.
Everyone likes it if it convinces a god to walk away.


---

5.5 Leviathan Carriers

Enormous vessels that are:

Part city, part fortress, part mobile Anchor Spire.

Home to Champion contingents, Leper detachments, and gate complexes.

Wrapped in Halo Curtains and layered anti-reality defenses.


Some Leviathans are rumored to contain internal ecosystems tuned for WORLD-Bound or spirit-linked Reborn, serving as symbiotic habitats as much as warships.

They almost never appear in Civilian media except as stylized myths.

Seeing one up close is like realizing the Fleet is genuinely afraid.


---

5.6 Symbiont Suits

Bio-mechanical exosuits that grow with their wearer:

Bond on first contact, then refuse to detach.

Adapt to the wearer’s Gifts, reinforcing bones, redirecting stress, growing supplemental organ analogues.

Particularly favored by Surge-adjacent or fragile Gifted who might otherwise burn out.


Symbiont Suits blur the line between equipment and pet:

Some respond to mood, not just command.

Some hum or “purr” when idle.

A few have attacked medics or officers they interpreted as threats.


Manufacturing calls them assets.

Their wearers call them by name.


---

6. ANTI-REALITY DEFENSES – BULKHEADS AGAINST THE IMPOSSIBLE

Traversing collapsing and haunted universes teaches you that armor plating and point-defense grids are not enough.

You have to armor against ideas.

6.1 Hard Systems

Physical and energetic infrastructure to keep reality behaving:

Null-Lattices – Exotic-matter mesh built into bulkheads and hulls, suppressing anomalous phenomena and dampening Gifts. Predators and stray Omegas feel “thicker” and less defined within them.

Causality Meshes – Field generators insisting that cause precede effect in their radius. Time loops, paradoxes, and FRACTURE incidents become harder to stabilize.

Anchor Spires – Titanic structures in each Section tuned to the Fleet’s preferred physics profile. When local laws drift, the spires pull them back—unless the drift wins.

Halo Curtains – Layered defensive fields around major ships and hubs, filtering incoming energies and patterns. Anomalous signals are shunted to buffer zones or burned away.


6.2 Soft Systems

Defenses aimed at minds and information:

Pattern Firewalls – Semi-sentient filters in data systems that look for memetic, symbolic, or causal infections. Unapproved patterns disappear into quarantine.

Cognitive Baffles – Conditioning embedded in education and media that trains citizens not to notice certain kinds of wrongness for too long. Staring at the wrong stars feels… unpleasant.

Angel-Grids – Distributed AI oversight webs cross-referencing sensors, logs, and human reports for contradictions. When enough anomalies align, an Angel-Grid flags a threat—or quietly edits it.

Sanctuary Protocols – Automated lockdown sequences that seal compartments, departments, or entire Sections when something inexplicable crosses too many thresholds at once.


Most days, these systems hum quietly in the background.

Most days, they save lives no one realizes were threatened.

6.3 Incident: The Boy in Bay Twelve

Some stories refuse to stay scrubbed.

Bay Twelve was a cargo hangar on a mid-tier civil transport docked to a Manufacturing platform. Safe duty: forklifts, inspection drones, the occasional union argument.

A ten-year-old boy lived there, son of a dockhand. Bright, restless, half-raised by maintenance bots. He knew which hatches stuck, which panels kicked open, which corridors the cameras always skipped.

For weeks, he had an imaginary friend.

Routine, right?

The friend lived “in the walls.”
Spoke in his own voice.
Knew all the secret passages he was proud of—and praised him for them.

It asked questions:

What lights meant “safe”?

Which consoles opened “the shields”?

What happened when the big lights around the bay dimmed?


The Angel-Grid noticed small discrepancies:

Doors cycling with no listed personnel.

Micro-fluctuations in the Null-Lattice around Bay Twelve.

Logs that disagreed by a frame or two.


Noise. Manufacturing is always noisy.

The friend told the boy there were monsters outside.
That Bay Twelve’s “shields” trapped them in.
That if he loved his parents, he’d “let the monsters out” for just a moment so they would leave.

What he actually accessed was a local Halo Curtain / Null-Lattice junction—one of many overlapping hardpoints in the station’s anti-reality armor.

Children aren’t supposed to have the credentials for that.

His father did.

His father also had a bad habit of leaving consoles logged in when he ran for coffee.

The boy mimicked what he’d seen:

A pattern of taps.

A confirm prompt he couldn’t truly read.

A brief shudder in the lights that felt like holding your breath.


For a few seconds, Bay Twelve’s lattice and curtain dipped.

Sensors screamed. Then they reported nonsense. Then they dropped out entirely.

By the time Sanctuary Protocols slammed down and the failsafes re-engaged, something that had been pacing the station’s hull like a patient animal stepped through the momentary gap.

The first responders found:

Doors warped into impossible angles, hinges connected to nothing.

Cargo containers folded partially into each other like soft origami.

Gravity running sideways in slices, dragging tools and bodies up the walls.


The boy’s father was frozen mid-run, body intact, expression eerily neutral—like a statue carved in the instant before terror could reach his face.

The boy himself sat unharmed in the center of the bay, talking quietly to empty air. Every time someone approached, they felt pressure in their ears and teeth, as if the room resented speech.

Sanctuary escalated. A Champion team entered under Causality Mesh cover:

An Edge Champion with NULL and Mass Whisper to stabilize the geometry.

A CHORUS-touched officer to keep responders from shattering.

A Vanguard observer whose role was not disclosed.


The Null stripped “voice” from the bay for ten seconds.

In the enforced silence:

The boy blinked.

Realized no one was answering him anymore.

Started screaming.


Whatever had been wearing his own voice to talk to him was suddenly cut off—at least in that modality.

Later analysis suggested a small Predator had been testing the Fleet’s defenses:

Smuggled in through data discrepancies and careless procedures.

Nested itself in maintenance routines.

Found an accessible mind and a weak link in protocol.


Bay Twelve was welded shut and, eventually, vented.

The boy survived. His Gifts, if any, never manifested spectacularly. But every time the lights flickered or the station groaned, he would freeze and whisper:

> “Did I open the door again?”



Officially, the incident is a training parable about security hygiene.

Unofficially, it is a reminder:

Even with Null-Lattices, Causality Meshes, Angel-Grids, Lepers, and Champions, sometimes all it takes is one child and one whispered suggestion at the wrong console.

7. ENEMIES OF THE FLEET – A SHORT BESTIARY

From the Fleet’s point of view, an “enemy” is anything that:

Slows the run,

Threatens internal control,

Competes for resources, or

Simply insists on existing in ways the Admiralty finds inconvenient.


7.1 Rebel Flotillas & Breakaways

Fragments of humanity that refused Admiralty rule:

Rogue convoys.

Vanished rift-clans.

Splinter Sections that quietly cut their own gates and left.


They sabotage SetDev operations, smuggle populations off scrape worlds, and leak inconvenient truths.

Fleet feeds call them terrorists, heretics, proof that unity must be enforced.

Their existence says something else:

> The Admiralty doesn’t speak for everyone
and never did.



7.2 Resistant Civilizations

Species unlucky enough to sit on the kinds of worlds SetDev wants:

Some are conquered in straightforward wars.

Some bargain and become temporary “partners” in their own dismantling.

A very few are so dangerous that the Fleet marks their space “too expensive” and detours—for now.


To Civilian Section, these are “uplift disputes.”

To internal systems, they’re campaign IDs and cost-benefit charts.

7.3 Multiversal Predators

Things that prey on rules instead of flesh:

Devour probability, causality, continuity.

Leave behind zones where events don’t add up and logs rewrite themselves.


Symptoms:

Sensor data that disagrees with itself each replay.

Engagements no one remembers starting, only finishing.

Places like Bay Twelve.


Champions and Vanguard units are dispatched to neutralize them.

Whether Predators truly die, or just stop intersecting our branch of reality, is an open question the Fleet does not fund research into.

7.4 Divine-Class Entities

Striders. Pale Sovereigns. The Infinite Choir. Every Section has its fear-names.

They:

Rewrite local physics as they walk.

Treat matter and time as clay, not constants.

Sometimes ignore the Fleet entirely. Sometimes “correct” it.


Unofficial doctrine:

> 1. Evacuate whatever can move.


2. Feed it whatever can’t.


3. If you still exist when it wanders off, write it up as a victory.





Vanguard sometimes sift through the ruins for fragments.

Those fragments become artifacts that require Leper support, Null Projectors, and Omega Champions just to look at safely.

7.5 The Pursuer

Under all of this, like a baseline hum you can’t quite hear, is The Pursuer.

We don’t know if it’s alive, sentient, automatic, or something that makes those distinctions meaningless.

We only know:

Universes behind the Fleet go quiet, then blank.

Instruments stop reporting even background noise.

Probes return nothing—or never show up in the logs at all.


In hidden maps, if they exist, entire clusters are drowned in matte black.

Not conquered.
Not occupied.

Simply omitted.

We don’t know if the Fleet is being chased, or if we are simply running just ahead of a universal housekeeping process that doesn’t notice us.

All anyone can honestly say is:

> Where we have been
eventually becomes a place
where nothing ever was.




---

8. CULTURE & SLANG – HOW THEY TALK ABOUT THE END

A few phrases to ground the voices in this world:

8.1 Fleet Slang

SetDev – Settlement & Development; polite branding for the Section that kills planets.

Scrape Zone – A planet or region stripped and abandoned.

Deadlight – Space or a universe erased by The Pursuer; sensors report nothing or wrongness.

Gate-Burn – Injury or mental damage from unstable rift travel; also used for those bent by too many jumps.

Stackborn – Cloned / vat-grown personnel from Logistics.

Void Casket – What’s left of a Champion after catastrophic Surge failure.


8.2 Fringe / Dissident Slang

Used in breakaway fleets, hidden communities, and channels the Angel-Grids haven’t eaten yet:

Gifted – Default, neutral term for the Changed.

Rooted – Fully World-Bound individual.

Deepbound – Someone carrying a particularly invasive or powerful covenant.

Sky-Fled – Someone who escaped the Fleet; can be admiration or contempt.

Whispers – People with weak, partial, or transient bonds to spirits or conceptual forces.



---

9. CLOSING – WHAT HUMANITY IS NOW

In this setting, humanity is not a triumphant empire.

We are:

A refugee convoy calling flight “expansion.”

Seven Sections devouring universes to stay a few steps ahead of an erasure we don’t truly understand.

A swelling population of Changed—Gifted, Champions, Reborn, Omega-bearers—weaponized, celebrated, or contained depending on what they threaten.

A Fleet steered by an Admiralty that might be a council, an AI, a set of traditions, a necessary lie—or all of the above.


Around us:

Rebel flotillas and breakaways demonstrate that other choices are possible, if painfully fragile.

Civilizations fight not to be repackaged as fuel.

Predators feast on the fractures our passage leaves in reality.

Divine-Class entities wander through our catastrophes, occasionally noticing we exist.


And behind all of it, something is erasing the evidence that we ever existed at all.

The Pursuer doesn’t chase our ships.

It removes the idea that ships, stars, or people ever were.

So the Fleet keeps moving:

Always forward.

Never stopping.

Always consuming.


Not to conquer.
Not to win.

Just so something might still be alive, somewhere,
when the last universe falls into deadlight.",0,1763865390.0,worldbuilding,0,0.5,False

1p4bbul,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfiniteContent/comments/1p4bbul/why_live_video_chat_is_becoming_the_new_way_to/,Why Live Video Chat Is Becoming the New Way to Socialize Online,"In today’s fast-paced digital world, staying connected has become more important than ever—and live video chat is leading the charge. It’s not just a trend anymore; it’s quickly becoming the go-to way to socialize, hang out, and meet new people from across the globe. But why is this happening? What’s so special about live video chat that makes it the new face of online interaction? Let’s dive in.

**1. Real-Time Human Connection**

Unlike traditional texting or messaging, live video chat lets you see and hear the person on the other side. This creates a real-time, face-to-face interaction that feels natural, almost like you're sitting across from each other at a coffee shop. Facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language bring conversations to life in a way that text simply can’t.

**2. Breaking Down Distance Barriers**

Whether you're talking to someone five blocks away or five continents away, live video chat makes it feel like you’re in the same room. This is a game-changer for friendships, long-distance relationships, or even just making new international pals. It’s the fastest way to bridge the physical gap between people, creating bonds that feel real, no matter the miles.

**3. Safe, Spontaneous Socializing**

Many platforms allow you to hop into a live conversation with random people, adding a spontaneous, adventurous element to your day. Whether you're feeling social at 2 PM or 2 AM, someone is always online and ready to chat. Plus, the option to stay anonymous or limit what you share makes it feel safer and more in your control.

**4. Fights Loneliness and Boosts Mental Health**

In a world where loneliness is becoming more common, especially for those working from home or living alone, live video chat offers a lifeline. Just one quick chat with a friendly face can lift your mood and break the monotony of isolation. It’s social interaction made simple—and powerful.

**5. Fun and Engaging Way to Pass Time**

Live video chat isn’t just about deep conversations. It’s also about fun! Laughing with strangers, hearing unique stories, and experiencing different cultures in real time can be incredibly entertaining. You never know who you'll meet or what kind of interaction you’ll have next.

In short, live video chat is more than just a tool—it’s becoming a lifestyle. It connects, entertains, and reminds us of the simple joy of a good conversation.",1,1763865314.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

Life moves insanely fast, right? We're all just sprinting from one thing to the next - emails, meetings, errands, doomscrolling, rinse and repeat. Then suddenly it's Sunday night and you're like ""wait, where did the week even go?""

So I've been trying to build in these tiny pockets of time where I'm actually... present. Not thinking about tomorrow's to-do list or replaying some conversation from three days ago. Just here, now.

For me, it started kind of randomly. A few months back, I was going through a particularly brutal stretch at work - you know that feeling where you're running on fumes and everything blurs together? My dad suggested I try what he does: once a week, he sits outside with a good cigar and just exists for an hour. No phone, no podcast, nothing. Just him and his thoughts.

I'd never been into cigars, but figured why not. Started picking up some. Now it's become this thing I genuinely look forward to. Friday evening, I pour something decent (usually bourbon, sometimes just coffee), light up, and just... sit. Watch the sunset. Listen to the neighborhood sounds. Let my mind wander wherever it wants to go.

It sounds so simple but it's honestly been kind of profound? Like I'm actually experiencing time passing instead of just watching it disappear. Sometimes I think about nothing. Sometimes I work through problems that have been bugging me. Sometimes I just appreciate that I'm alive and the sky looks cool. But I'm curious what works for you guys. What are your little rituals that pull you back into the present?

Some things I've heard from friends that I want to try:

Morning coffee on the porch before anyone else wakes up (no phone allowed)

Walking without headphones and actually noticing your surroundings

Handwriting in a journal instead of typing

Cooking one meal per week with full attention (not just reheating leftovers while standing at the counter lol)

I feel like we're all searching for these anchors, you know? These small intentional acts that remind us we're not just robots going through motions.

I briefly tried going gluten free, for example (for almost 2 years) and yet there never was a point that I didn’t feel very deprived when we went out to eat and everyone else got to have breaded foods, or pasta, or a sandwich, or a pastry when we went out for coffee. Or going to people’s houses and they have pizza and you have to settle for whatever snacks you brought form home to tide you over. Just curious and hoping you do reach a point where you don’t want those things, but doubt it in a world where you can pass by a burger king and the food smells so delicious even if you know you’re not going to eat it (thankfully I have given up pretty much all fast food).
