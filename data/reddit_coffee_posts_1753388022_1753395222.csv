I manage finances for an elderly family member who is wheelchair bound. He often likes to go to his local shopping area and hang out. He's always with a caregiver. I want to set up a prepaid or low limit credit card for him to use if he wants to grab a coffee or snack while he's out. The caregivers are trustworthy but I would have more peace of mind with a card I can control. Thanks in advance for recs! ",1,1753395031.0,personalfinance,0,1.0,False
1m8hvzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m8hvzm/i_m32_am_not_really_happy_in_a_relationship_with/,"I (M32) am not really happy in a relationship with my fiance (F28), are my arguments valid?","Ive been with my fiance for about 8 years now. Got engaged like 4 years ago, or 3. We've been living together for 3 years and the longer we live together, the less happy I am.

My gf was great when we started dating, lots of energy, things she wanted to do, overall I thought I will marry her. Right now if somebody asked me a question ""is she the one?"" i'd say no. She's my only gf ive ever had, but i think I can recognize how a relationship should look like. She's constantly tired, doesn't clean after herself in the apartment, doesn't want to drive a car (its always me who has to drive us around). She has license, has her car, but she just doesnt want to. She cannot find anything that we could do or go together, its always my responsibility to find something to do. She can't find any vacations, book hotels, nothing. She just expects everyone to do things for her, I don't know why. I asked her one time to find us some vacations. Her response? ""oh, my sister can find us something"". She was supposed to find me a gift for our anniversary. Who was out looking for it and choosing which necklace to buy? Her sister.

We are engaged. We did not sit down to talk about possible marriage, set up a date or anything. She just says she wishes she was married already. Same thing with the house. She wants a house. We haven't sat down and talked about any options at all. NOTHING. She shows no engagement in anything else. I asked her once if she started saving any money towards a house... ""No, I make minimum wage I have nothing to save"". Her other response: ""my parents have land, they will give it to me but we have to get married"".

All she does is go to work, come back home and occasionally do a laundry. Most of the times she complains on me that i didnt do something. I remember the time I cleaned the apartment, but missed one spot in the bathroom. She came back from work and THE ONLY THING she said was about that one spot being not cleaned. She thought adding ""im just joking"" would make me feel less shit.

She's always tired. I recently asked her to take two plastic bottles with her and throw it out in the trashcan on her way to work. Her response? ""I DON'T HAVE TIME. THERE'S WATER IN THE BOTTLES AND THEY'RE NOT CRUSHED"".

I'm honestly so tired. She does not encourage anything in the relationship and it should be a job for 2 people. You give something from yourself, and it makes me want to give something from myself and vice versa.

On her days off, she sleeps till 10-11. Why? It's either 4 things:

1. its too hot in the room so she keeps falling asleep,
2. the fan is blowing cool air and its just so good to be in bed so she falls asleep
3. ""it's my day off i gotta sleep after all those days of waking up early""
4. i didnt have my phone with me so i didnt know what time it is

Going to the store for breakfast? Me.

Going to the store for supper? Me.

Asking her to make a coffee for us? ""You do it, im tired, i was/am gonna go to work

It's like everything is a war zone with her and i need to interrogate her to do anything.

""Can you please drive?"" No, you drive us, i dont want to because im stressing out.

She had a MINOR fender bender like 2 years ago and ever since then, she drives extra miles around town to avoid being on the intersection she had that fender bender on years ago.

I asked her to go to a therapist to talk about it and her being stressed out. ""No, you go to therapist"".

I think she just stopped trying, but if I ever raise this topic with her, she gets offensive and starts looking and saying things that i'm not doing how i should etc.

ANY TIME she has a day off (doesnt really happen a lot) I ask her what she wants to do, where she wants to go? ""I don't know. Take me somewhere.""

Is this really how it all should look like in a relationship? It feels like im fighting this battle for too long and I'm just so tired of this ""I'm tired"". I got angry tonight and she asked me ""what did i say or do wrong this time?!"" and it made me rage inside even more, because she makes it look like I'm perfect and i constantly have a problem with her. I'm not perfect, I have my flaws, but it's hard to give 100% in the relationship when you're getting like 50% back. Maybe 40.

Our apartment is small, but it's a mess all the time. So many times I cleaned it completely only to have it trashed by her within 2 days and when I mention I clean she just laughs...

I'm scared that within the next argument im just gonna loose it and say ""we're done"", but I don't really think I can keep this up much longer. I want a partner. Not a kid that I have to take care of.

You know... when I go to the store in the morning or evening, or go to church in the morning and see couples together... my heart breaks. Last week it was my 4th church visit alone, even tho it was her who made me come back to church. I stand there, look at those couples and I envy them. I get back home and ask her why she didnt go with me again. Her response? ""You should have woken me up'. The Mass was at 11. Sometimes i attended a Mass at 1 pm. Really? If she wanted to go with me, she'd set up an alarm, becasue she knows I go every Sunday. Am I being stupid thinking all this or what?

What is your opinion on this? Does it sound like a relationship that's meant to be doomed?

Here are skills that helped from [Better Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/better-small-talk-by-patrick-king)

**1. Preparation is the key**One small trick I learned: prep 2–3 casual topics in advance. It could be something I watched, weekend plans, a local event. When my brain goes blank, I have something to fall back on.

2. **The 1:1:1 Method** This one saved me during awkward moments: • Say hi to **1 person** • Ask **1 question** (e.g., “Any fun weekend plans?”) • Share **1 thing** (e.g., “I’m trying to survive Monday without caffeine”) Do it once a day. Low-stakes, high payoff.

**3. Following up matters** 

 If starting a conversation feels hard, try this: don’t start one. Just listen carefully. Pick up something the other person mentioned, and follow up later. That won’t let the conversation die awkwardly either.

**4. Behavior first, comfort second** Waiting until I “feel ready” never worked. And honestly, the silence in those moments? Painful. So I started with just a “Good morning.” That’s it. I stopped overthinking what to say and began treating small talk like a simple greeting, not a performance. Turns out, acting confident is often the first step to actually becoming confident.

If small talk makes your skin crawl, you just need a few tools.

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",1,1753394600.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Bit long, so if you don’t want to read it all – I’ve attached a few of my favorite photos I took.

If one stands out from the rest, I’d love to hear which one.

My 8th Vegas Trip and still figuring out the tips and tricks.

Highlights: Go Pool Cabana, Good Pie, Best Friend, Pinky's and Winning a bit of money!

 
Day 1

Arrived around 4pm from Canada.  First time in a long time flying Air Canada and boy has it changed, great flight.  Complimentary beer and wine now?!

And what the heck are those pretzel things; they are like crack.  (Twigz Buttery herb and garlic craft pretzels).

If you are Canadian wondering about Customs, The border, etc while going into the USA.

Zero issues.  Everything was completely normal.

 5PM - Checked in to the Flamingo.  About 10 people in line?  Nice.

After countless times thinking of trying the ""$20 Trick"" and never doing it I decided I am 100% trying it, but with $50.

For context, I was able to book a trip via Expedia from Canada for $440 all in (Back in January)  Crazy price.

That's like 320 USD.  Add in resort fees (Another 400 CDN) and still a great deal.

$440 was for Flight and hotel (Flamingo basic room, non renovated)

So I figured if this $50 trick gets us into a renovated room, score.

It worked.  Renovated room, 26th floor, strip view.

After check in, our traditional first stop.  In N out.  Glorious as always, especially for the price.  Double Double with grilled onions and animal style fries.

Continue our adventure to Miracle Mile, stop into ABC for a few cheaper drinks.

Ended off with a bit of gambling in the Flamingo, nothing crazy.  No winnings to share.

 

Day 2.

HOT.  So, what better way to spend the day at the outdoor North premium outlets.

Bad idea lol, but found some decent deals at Nike.  After this, we took an uber over to Smith's to stock up on cheaper essentials.

Water, mix, booze, snacks, couple breakfast items and Iced Coffees.  Our room had a mini fridge so this helped.

We saved a good chunk of money doing this, highly recommend if you're staying a few nights and want to stretch your money into other things.

Back to hotel to unload and went for a quick dip at the Go Pool.  I'll get more into the Go Pool later.

After that, Off to Good Pie - 10 or so minutes off the strip.  GREAT Pizza!!  Had Deep fried ravioli, Meatballs to start.

And 3 large pizzas.  About 240 usd split between 8 people (30/ea) 

After Good Pie, Fremont.  Fremont is always one of our favorites.  Great times.

Found my favorite Slot - Little Shop of Horrors.  Down to my last $13 in the machine and hit a small jackpot for 200.

Gave me wife 20 for some fish game, and she won another 50.  Nice!  Cash it all out - and make our way over to White Castle.

Never had it before.  Here's my honest review:  I will never go back lol.  Not for me.  Tasted like a microwaved next day McDouble.

Very odd.  Back to Flamingo, to rest for Day 3.

 

Day 3.

Up early to get some fresh air around the Flamingo sanctuary.

Then off to the Fashion Show mall and the Wynn.

I've never been to the Wynn so I wanted to check it out, BEAUTIFUL. 
After that, back to home base to get ready for our reservation at Pinkys.

Pinky's was great.  Really good service, ambience and food.  All the girls absolutely loved it.  Expensive?  Yes.  3 Cocktails, Goat cheese balls and Mac n Cheese was around 120.

After Dinner, made our way over to the Luxor for Carrot Top.  Been to Vegas numerous times and every time I think ""we should finally go see Carrot Top"" but we never do.

Until this trip, I was 100% determined.  AND let me tell you, Absolutely Worth it.  100000%.  Great time.  He killed it.  Tickets were around $70.  Best show for that price, hands down.

After Carrot Top, back to Flamingo for some light gambling, nothing crazy.  

 

Day 4.

Go Pool Day.  VIP Cabana (North) Cabana for 10 people (just shy of $500)

Min Spend I believe was $400?  

Awesome day, great weather.  Our server was amazing and Cabana VIP North is the way to go.

Right in front of the action and you get your own little private pool.  DJ and music loud but not too loud in that spot as well.

Going in, we knew it would be expensive and boy, is it ever.  It's actually comical.  BUT ""its part of the experience""

Famous, Las Vegas words.  Quick recap, Nachos - $89.99.  2 Bottles of Bacardi 1L - $325/EA .... 

Pina Colada slush drink - $39.99..  I'll stop there, we tripled our Min spend easy.

However, was it worth it?  100%.  We spent the entire day at the pool and had a blast.  Everyone felt like it was pretty much open bar, and tons of food.

Per person, about $220 for the day.  I'd say that's worth it for 10am-5pm entertainment.  Also felt like VIP without spending VIP money.

Back to the room at 5PM for a quick recharge...  Lol, yeah right - that recharge lasted until the next morning.  Heat, pool and booze will get you quick.

 

Day 5

Haven't been this hungover for years.  Felt like I got hit by a truck, but up we go.  

Shower (Water pressure at Flamingo is A+)  and off for a walk to get some Gatorade and something to eat at CVS.

CVS sucks for food, all I wanted was a sandwich or something easy and light.  

Subway it is, $20 footlong - nice.  Saved me though, thanks Subway.

Had a few first timers with us, so they wanted to see the Bellagio Conservatory.  Works for me, I still enjoy the free tourist things in Vegas.

After that, over to Cosmo for some food.  BangBar by Momofuku, nothing special.  I'm a big Momofuku fan but this was subpar.  Tried some noodles at China Poblano, very good.  And then Milk Bar pie for dessert, perfect.  After that I had to show them Secret Pizza, so shared a slice.  Cool spot but very mid pizza.

Good pie was much better IMO.

Back to Flamingo to freshen up and then it's off to our reservation at Best Friend (Park MGM).  (Geeze, we eat a lot).

Best Friend was fantastic.  Great vibes and music.  Food was all very good.  Highlights - Slippery Shrimp, Kimchi Carbonara, Big Boy Platter.

I would recommend this place 10 times out of 10.  Price was all very fair.  $19 cocktails, most dishes right around $20 and everything very shareable.  (I liked it better than Momofuku).

Under $100 per person and we had food left over!  After that, back to Fremont where we found Bubble Craps.  We don't play craps, but we found bubble craps to be super fun.

Playing light on the board and hunting Lucky Roller bonuses.  We hit the Roll Em all 156 to 1 - 4 TIMES!  With bets on both Low rolls and High rolls.  That both paid out 31 to 1.

So, we had an absolute blast playing on Fremont.  Cheaper drinks, cheaper minimums and the vibe on Fremont just feels so much more like Vegas was 10-15 years ago.

Next trip, I think we'll be staying on Fremont.  As the night winds down, everyone decides to head back to the strip and to home base.  Everyone goes up except me and a friend.

We decide to rip Bubble craps again.  Getting crushed.  But we are low rollers so we aren't down and out yet.  We just have a blast hunting for the big bonuses.  Go on a bit of a run, get low roller bonus, nice!  Back in it.  Few minutes later, we do it again.  Roll em all.  lol  First time in Vegas I actually won money!  Call it a night after this.

 

Day 6, home time.

Finish off our trip with 2 obligatory spots as Canadians.

Chick Fil A (Which just opened in Canada) and Earl of Sandwich (Holiday Turkey sandwich)

Pack up and head back to the airport.  Worst part of the trip is the uber ride back to the airport followed by sitting there for your flight home when everyone else is arriving.  Felt like yesterday that was opposite.  Walking past all the suckers going home while you were just arriving.  Oh well, time to go home - Full of memories, calories and this time a bit of money!

(Nothing life changing but enough to pay off some of the trip)

Thanks for reading, hope the information helps someone.  If you want more detailed info regarding anything I have mentioned feel free to DM me. 

Until next time! – Love you Vegas.

TLDR; Vegas is not dead but a bit quieter,
Best friend is awesome, Go Pool Cabana is worth it if you can split with 10 people, play Bubble Craps.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Atlético Mineiro vs. Atlético Bucaramanga: A Copa Sudamericana Showdown Where the ""Galo"" Crows About Its Lead**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a tale of two Atléticos—one with the swagger of a peacock in a poultry contest (Atlético Mineiro), and the other with the urgency of a guest who forgot the punchline (Atlético Bucaramanga). Let’s parse the odds, digest the drama, and crown a winner with the flair of a magician who’s *definitely* not pulling a rabbit out of a hat… unless that rabbit is named Hulk.

---

### Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem

The bookmakers have spoken, and they’re not mincing words. Atlético Mineiro is a heavy favorite at decimal odds of **1.57–1.61** (implied probability: **63–62%**), while Bucaramanga is a long shot at **6.0** (16.7%). The draw sits at **3.8** (26.3%), which is about the same chance as your local barista remembering your coffee order. The spread? Mineiro is -0.75, meaning they’re expected to win by a goal, while Bucaramanga needs to shock the world (and maybe a few statisticians) by pulling off an 0.75-goal underdog rally.

The total goals line is set at **2.0**, with the under favored. If this game爆发s into a goal-fest, bookmakers will probably cry in their beer.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and the Curse of the ""Almost""

Atlético Mineiro, the “Galo” (rooster), enters this leg with a 1-0 series lead but a Serie A résumé that’s… *questionable*. They’ve lost their last two league games to Bahía and Palmeiras, with Hulk—yes, *that* Hulk—scoring two free-kick masterpieces in a 3-2 loss. But here’s the kicker: Mineiro has kept **three clean sheets in their last five continental games** and thrives at the Arena MRV, where the atmosphere is so electric, it could power a city for a week.

Bucaramanga? They’re the soccer equivalent of a Wi-Fi signal that’s “there… maybe.

I Caught My Billionaire with His Sister
Chapter 1
Right in the middle of making love with my husband, Ryan Morris, his foster younger sister suddenly burst into our bedroom. All she wore was nothing but a sheer nightgown.
Looking heartbreakingly fragile, she turned to him and said in a tearful voice, ""Ryan, I'm scared to be alone...""
Ryan got up helplessly and followed her back to her room.
I sat alone in the dark for what felt like hours. Then I made a decision. I called a dozen gigolos over and threw a party at the house.
***
Finally, Ryan came out when the music and laughter got way too loud.
""Everyone out.""
He said it so casually, but the temperature in the room seemed to have dropped instantly.
The guys scattered like their lives depended on it. In just seconds, the living room was empty—except for the two of us.
""Julia Camden! What was that about?""
Ryan glared at me.
Behind him, Rachel Morris was still in that barely-there white lace slip dress. Her lengthy hair fell over her shoulders. She was playing the helpless little sister so well.
I leaned back on the couch, legs crossed, sipping my drink. ""Didn't Rachel say she was scared to be alone? I got a few more people here to keep her company.""
Her face drained of color. ""What do you think I am?!""
I smiled coldly and said slowly, ""A shameless woman trying to seduce her own brother.""
Ryan's expression turned ice-cold. ""Julia.""
Rachel's eyes filled with tears, her body shaking with anger. ""Who are you to judge me? Everyone knows you're just a party girl! You're a slut! If it weren't for the arrangement between our families, why would Ryan ever marry someone like you?""
""Rachel, that's enough!"" Ryan snapped.
Rachel froze, her eyes red as she broke down crying. ""You're yelling at me? How could you take her side? Didn't you hear what she said? Fine! I'm leaving! I'm leaving right now!""
She stormed toward the door. The ridiculously short nightgown riding up like it might slip off completely.
Ryan frowned, grabbed her by the waist, carried her back to her room, then returned to me.
""Go to bed.""
I didn't move. Instead, I laughed coldly in his face.
Ryan looked exhausted. ""I'm exhausted. Can we not do this right now?""
""Did you hear what Rachel said?""
""She's young. Sometimes she says things without thinking. I'll apologize for her, okay? I'm sorry.""
I gave him a crooked smile. ""She wasn't wrong. Yeah, sure, commercially speaking, our families are a good match. It's a business marriage. We've been engaged forever. And yeah, I'm a party girl. There's never a shortage of men around me—especially the hot ones.""
Ryan's expression darkened by the second.
He pushed me down onto the couch and kissed me hard like he was trying to punish me. His voice was low and rough. ""Julia, do you need me to remind you that you're my wife now?""
I smiled through the tears in my eyes, my voice trembling. ""Then don't forget about this! Who was the one dragging me out of bars? Who called himself my fiancé before we were even engaged? Who begged me to marry him until I finally said yes?""
He pulled me into his arms. ""It was me. I've only ever wanted you.""
I shoved him away coldly, and continued to slam the door behind me so hard it echoed through the house. ""Ryan, it's her or me. Tell her to leave tomorrow!""
The next morning.
Rachel bounced into the dining room. She was in one of Ryan's oversized shirts, like it was her own, when she greeted me cheerfully.
""Morning, Julia!""
I froze on the spot.
It felt like I had sunk to the bottom of a lake.
Chapter 2
After three years of marriage—without ever setting foot in a kitchen—Ryan was actually wearing an apron and making soup.
""Come try this, Julia!"" Rachel beamed at me. ""Ryan makes the best chicken soup. Whenever I'm feeling under the weather, one sip of his soup and I'm good as new!""
She called me a mess yesterday, and today, she's all smiles, bragging about how thoughtful Ryan is with her.
And Ryan? He acted like nothing happened. ""You're up? Come sit.""
Did he think everything I said last night was a joke?
Or had he already made his choice?
I took a deep breath, forcing down the rage and heartache building in my chest. I grabbed my phone and called my new assistant. ""Have breakfast ready for me. I want it on my desk at nine sharp.""
Then I turned and walked out without a second thought.
Behind me, I could hear Rachel whining. ""I already tried making peace with her. What more does she want? Whatever, let her starve. You made the soup for me anyway.""
On the drive to work, I called my brother.
""I'm getting a divorce.""
""You're kidding, right?""
I clutched my purse tightly. ""Dead serious.""
He couldn't believe it. ""Ryan agreed? After everything he did to be with you?""
I cut him off, irritation flashing through me. ""I don't care what he wants. I'm the one who wants the divorce.""
""Alright. Give me a month. I'll take care of everything.""
I tossed my phone aside and stared out the window. Sunlight streamed through the trees as we drove.
This morning, humiliated and exhausted, I made my choice.
Ryan, I'm done.
You and Rachel can enjoy your life together.
Right after the morning meeting, Ryan's assistant, Evan Clancy, showed up at my office with a huge bouquet of yellow roses—my favorite.
I barely glanced at them before handing them off to my new assistant. ""Here. You can have them.""
As luck would have it, Ryan walked in just in time to see the whole thing.
I stayed calm, with no expression on my face, and slipped a card into my assistant's shirt pocket. ""Breakfast was perfect. Consider this your bonus.""
He grinned and accepted it like it was nothing. ""Thanks.""
Ryan just stood there, watching him leave. Then he cornered me at my desk. ""You sure know how to get under my skin. Is this some payback?""
Chapter 3
I let out a cold laugh. ""If I were really trying to get back at you, I wouldn't have given him a card. I'd have handed him the keys to my beach house.""
Ryan looked helpless. ""I cleared my whole schedule today to come see you. You're still mad?""
He pulled me into his arms. ""Julia, what exactly are you mad about?""
I almost laughed in his face.
Unbelievable. I'd been furious all night, and Ryan didn't even know why?
I shoved my phone in his face.
It's a following request from Rachel.
Her new Instagram profile photo was obviously taken just today.
She was wearing the shirt Ryan wore this morning, striking a cutesy pose in a field of yellow roses, hands on her cheeks like she was in the middle of some influencer photo shoot.
""That breakfast? You didn't make it for me. You made it for her. Three years of marriage, and you've never cooked for me.
""And the flowers? You gave me a bouquet. She begged you for a whole damn flower field. Tell me I'm wrong.""
Ryan went quiet for a few seconds before finally speaking. ""If this is what it's about, I'll cook for you tonight. I can get you all the flowers you want.""
""Enough! Ryan, how are you still not getting it? Rachel crossed a line, and you let her. You let her waltz right into our marriage and do whatever the hell she wants.""
He looked at me like I was insane. ""Julia, what are you even talking about? Rachel's my sister.""
I laughed bitterly. ""And I'm my brother's sister too—but you don't see me strutting around his place in lingerie. I don't need him to tuck me in like I'm five, and I sure as hell don't leave bite marks on his collarbone.""
Ryan froze, then instinctively touched his collarbone.
""You think I didn't see that last night?""
He half-laughed, half-grimaced. ""She's always been like that. Like a puppy, she bites when she's moody.""
I waved him off. ""Stop. I don't want to hear about your precious childhood memories. And don't forget—she's not even your biological sister.""
He went silent.
""True,"" he admitted. ""But that doesn't mean we're doing anything inappropriate.""
I let out a bitter laugh, heart pounding, and shoved him off me.
""Get. Out. Now.""
But Ryan just smiled.
He leaned in close, lips curling playfully. ""Julia, in all these years, I've never seen you jealous because of me.
""I'll talk to her. I'll make sure she watches how she acts.
""Come on, don't be mad anymore, okay?""
He was always good at calming me down when I was about to blow up.
But just as I opened my mouth to speak, his phone rang.
Caller ID. Rachel.
Chapter 4
Ryan answered the phone, gave a few half-hearted ""uh-huh"" and ""yeah,"" and then hung up.
He reached for my hand. ""I'll call my parents. She's moving back home.""
Then his warm lips brushed against my ear. ""Come home early tonight, okay? What do you feel like eating? I'll cook something special—just for you.""
And just like that, a memory hit me.
Back then, he had stormed into a bar and dragged me out, downright furious.
But even then, he swallowed his anger and held back every harsh word.
Eyes red, voice low, he'd looked at me like he was utterly lost. ""Julia, what do you want me to do?""
My throat tightened.
""Alright, Ryan. I'll give you one more chance.
""But if you lie to me again...""
I dug my nails hard into the palm of his hand.
""I swear, I'll never forgive you. Not ever.""
He just smiled. Then, I gently kissed my tear-soaked eyelids.
""Julia, I've never lied to you. Not once.""
That night, I came home. Ryan wasn't back yet.
Rachel was sitting on the couch, cold and stiff, like some ghost full of resentment.
""Why haven't you accepted my following request?""
I barely looked at her. ""Why would I?""
""What did you say to Ryan?"" she snapped, stepping in front of me. ""Why is he making me move out?!""
I didn't even bother answering her.
But suddenly, like something in her just snapped, she grabbed a vase and hurled it at me.
The heavy glass smashed against my forehead. Pain exploded behind my eyes. A high-pitched ringing filled my ears. Rose thorns raked down my cheek and arm, slicing through my skin as they fell.
And right then, the door burst open—Ryan had arrived.
Rachel snatched up a shard of broken glass and pressed it to her wrist, sobbing like her soul was breaking. ""I just wanted to apologize! Why do you hate me this much? Do you really want me to die so you can be happy?""
Ryan's eyes went wide, pure panic. ""Rachel!""
""Ryan."" Rachel shook her head like she couldn't bear to go on. ""I've always been the extra one in this family. I'm done getting in the way of your happiness.""
Blood splattered.
Ryan's face went pale. He looked more terrified than I had ever seen him.
""Don't say that! I'll take you to the hospital right now.""
He scooped her into his arms and didn't even look at me.
That's when I started to panic.
""Ryan! She slashed her wrist—it had nothing to do with me!""
But he didn't turn around. Not once.
I slid down the wall and collapsed onto the floor.
It felt like someone had carved straight through my heart with a knife.
Chapter 5
Late at night, Ryan came home looking completely wiped out.
He casually held his suit jacket in one hand, leaned against the doorframe, and frowned at the sight of me packing a suitcase.
""You're leaving?""
""What do you think?""
The bite in my tone made his voice drop low. ""Can you not start this again? No one's blaming you.""
That line. Unbelievable.
""Wow. So this is what you call kindness?"" I dropped the suitcase and laughed coldly. ""Ryan, who gave you the right to judge me?""
He tried to hold it together, speaking calmly. ""I told you, I'll have her move back home. Why do you keep provoking her?""
""What did I even do?"" I shot back. ""All I did was not accept her following request. Look, I can't control who you sleep with, but I damn well get to choose who I let into my life.""
His expression turned cold, and for once, his voice actually showed anger.
""Julia! Do you always have to be this spiteful when you talk? How many times do I have to say it—she's my sister!
""She's just dependent. She found out she was adopted when she was a teenager, and it completely wrecked her. She tried to kill herself. She was diagnosed with depression. I was the one who got her into therapy, sent her overseas to recover.
""She can't handle emotional stress. I'm begging you. Just give her a little patience. Some empathy. Please.""
I stared at the man in front of me—the man who was always calm, always rational—now snapping at me like a volcano finally blowing.
And all I felt was emptiness.
Three years of marriage. He had never raised his voice at me like this.
Even when I used to mess with him to make him jealous, he'd always hold it in—never once said anything cruel.
Now, I couldn't even speak. The words were stuck in my throat like splinters.
I bit down so hard my lip split. The taste of blood filled my mouth.
I could barely stop my whole body from shaking. ""Yeah,"" I whispered. ""I'm harsh. I'm bitter. I'm awful."" I looked him dead in the eyes. ""So go run back to your poor, sweet, broken little sister. You're a perfect match.""
Ryan took a long breath like he was reaching his limit.
His voice went ice-cold. ""Forget the suitcase. I'll take her with me. We'll talk again when you've calmed down.""
I locked myself in my room.
I heard the sound of him packing. Then, the front door slammed shut.
Turns out, when your heart breaks past a certain point, you don't even have tears left to cry.
Ryan and I were officially living apart from each other.
I had no clue where he went, and I didn't care.
But then his cousin messaged me. Screenshots of Rachel's latest posts.
""What kind of family bans a 24-year-old from going to bars? Lol. Too bad, I'm going anyway."" The caption was posted alongside a screenshot of her chat with Ryan, where he had clearly told her not to go out.
""Tonight's menu, made with love by my favorite chef."" In the photo, Rachel was grinning at the camera while Ryan, in the background, fed her like they were a cozy little couple.
""Tried this for you guys—men's shirts are seriously the coziest."" She was lounging on the couch in what was unmistakably Ryan's shirt. Just over her shoulder, you could see him working in the background, completely unaware she was using him for the shot.
I looked at all of it and just smiled faintly.
Strange. The old me would've already stormed over there and slapped both of them across the face.
But now? I felt nothing. Just tired. It was almost laughable.
When my brother texted me updates about the divorce proceedings, my assistant happened to bring me a cup of coffee.
I had to admit, Jason Dawson was a damn good assistant.
Only a few weeks in, and he already knew what I liked. Hell, half the time, he anticipated my mood before I even spoke.
He sat on the edge of my desk, grinning. ""That sounded like good news. We should be drinking.""
I raised an eyebrow and hooked a finger through his tie.
His eyes darkened slightly.
""But I'm not in the mood for alcohol.""

Am I tracking wrong or am I not in a deficit?,"I'm currently 5'10"", 27F. I gained about 10 lbs over the last few months and weigh 170 (down 5lbs from 175 in June). When I was 160 I had about 24 percent body fat. I do think some of the weight gain is muscle, since I've been training for triathlons all winter and weight lifted. I want to lose those last 20-30lbs though and cut my calories to 1800 from 2500. I try to hit my protein goal of 120g a day, however eating this way is just making me full by 5pm. I'll get to 1300 calories and my BMR is 1500 (supposedly). I just get so full and don't want to eat anything more.

Am I measuring wrong? I don't use much oil, and weigh everything with a scale and put it into my fitness pal. I do drink a lot of black coffee and tea. I ate pretty healthy before, mostly whole foods, but really never got that high up there in protein. I also am training for a half marathon in November, so I'll get cardio in anywhere from 5-7 hours a week between running and cycling. You'd think that'd make me ravenous.

Do ya'll think it's ok to eat 1500 if I'm feeling fine? InBody and Evolt said that's my BMR, and I do not want to start losing hair or my period (it happened with my initial weight loss 3 years ago from 230-155).

Having unique experiences is possibly the worst someone can go through. No one relates or truly understands and that kind of experience can make someone go insane.

I (F22) have lived my entire life ever since I can remember with a chronic sore throat. It has ruined my life and made me craft a plan with less suffering to end my life at some point.

I have always been dismissed by doctors because this chronic thing apparently doesn't give enough warning signs such as inflammation. I have had a tonsil removal and that's it.

The worst part that is slowly making me spiral into insanity and affecting my life is sensitivity to ciggarette smoke. I cannot stand it and it is everywhere. I get this disgusting phlegm immediately when I feel it. Doctors look at me like I'm the weird one or dismiss me. It is so normalized and I'm the crazy one for having to avoid it. 

When I walk on the street I have to check men's hands to see if they hold a ciggarette so I have to either avoid them or hold my breath. I do not go out with anyone because a simple walk is exhausting to me. All bars are filled with smokers. All entrances are filled with smokers.

I have isolated myself because everyone always smokes. Everyone always asks why I'm alone and don't go with my peers, but I can't. Every day is hell to me. Walking is hell to me. Waiting for the bus is hell to me. Opening the window in my own apartment is hell to me. 

Smoking at balconies is illegal here but my neighbors are pieces of shit. And my family are spinless. And when I'm gone they'll only care that I'm ""selfish"" to do it.

I also cannot eat or drink anything cold as it makes me have incredible throat pain. I cannot drink cold drinks. I have had to heat my milk when eating cereal. I have to eat ice cream with warm tea or coffee. I have to take medicine after I drink something cold.

Having to pretend I'm okay when I'm in constant pain or finding ways to cope has been exhausting. I always get expectations on me, but never care.

1m8hfm2,https://i.redd.it/4oq0zuq78wef1.jpeg,Doubt about 18g in IMS B702TH24.5M filter [Rocket R58 + Eureka Libra],"Hi everyone,
I'm testing several coffees (especially Giamaica Caffè) with a Rocket R58 + Eureka Libra setup. I use the IMS B702TH24.5M filter and normally dose around 18g.

The doubt is:
with approximately 18.3g, the puck clearly touches the IMS shower head (also verified with the plasticine ball method). In the cup the result is good (dense cream, body ok), but sometimes I feel like it lacks a bit of complexity or is slightly ""compressed"".

I attach photos of the post-extraction puck where you can see the clear signs of the shower.
The gasket is new (silicone), the hand shower is IMS.

Requests:
	1. Does 18g in this filter seem too much?
	2. Is it better to go down to 17.5g to have more space and less compression, or switch to the 26.5mm filter even with 18g?
	3. Can the impact on the cup profile be significant if the coffee is too close to the shower head?

Ok, I only said that Lena Dunham was cute after I saw the movie ""Treasure.""  Her character was very down to earth and that's how I like my women.  I prefer late 30s - 50s.  A woman who takes care of herself--emotionally, physically, spiritually--well put together, chill vibe who has a stable career and financially independent. Not afraid to be spontaneous.  College educated, caring, compassionate person who has emotional intelligence, and integrity.  Not looking for over the top maintenance, loud, obnoxious women.  Someone who knows their self worth, great communicator, understands boundaries and not afraid to set them, open to new ideas, talk about philosophical and deep meaning conversations.  Quirky, in a cute way.  Enjoys a drink, but can live without it.  Someone who has put in the work to be the best version of themselves and chasing that everyday.  Knows how to be playful, youthful, but not immature.  No smoking, no drugs, no kids, no side chicks or confused. No men.

This inconspicuous little tree has often been called the “Miracle Tree” by a few cultures, and in the Western world it is quickly becoming one of the most frequently talked about superfoods, and for pretty good reason.

# What is Moringa?

Moringa leaf ([*Moringa oleifera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moringa_oleifera)), is a fast-growing tree that is native to certain parts of Africa and Asia. Its leaves and seed pods have been used medicinally for centuries to help with symptoms such as energy levels and immune system support. In modern days, science has finally begun analyzing and studying the plant, and so far has confirmed many of the potential benefits that ancient cultures have been proclaiming all along.

At World’s Best Supplements, our [Pure Moringa Leaf 400mg Capsules](https://worldsbestsupplements.com/products/pure-moringa-leaf-400mg-60-capsules) are made with 100% all-natural moringa leaf powder, with no added fillers, or fluff, just pure good stuff.

# 6 Awesome Benefits of Moringa Supplements

1. **Moringa is packed with nutrients:** Moringa leaves are a nutritional powerhouse, so much so that even tiny amounts of it consumed per day can provide a broad range of essential vitamins and minerals such as: Vitamin A, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, and Potassium. It’s also a rich source of natural antioxidants, which makes it an excellent choice for supporting overall wellness.
2. **It supports better inflammation response:** Modern diets and lifestyle stress often contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation that people sadly learn to put up with on a nearly daily basis. That constant inflammation puts a strain on our bodies, and can lead to issues such as fatigue and joint pain, among others. Pure Moringa Leaf is packed with natural plant compounds like Quercetin and Chlorogenic Acid, which can help the body manage inflammation in a more balanced way.
3. **Promotes better blood sugar levels:** Some recent studies are beginning to suggest that Moringa may also help regulate blood sugar by slowing down the absorption of glucose from food and improving insulin sensitivity. This can make it an ideal daily supplement for supporting metabolic health.
4. **Jitter-free energy boost:** Unlike caffeine and other stimulants found in coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks, Moringa offers a natural boost in energy thanks to its Vitamin B, Magnesium, and Iron content. These can support a more stable, sustained release of energy throughout the day with less tendency for a crash.
5. **Immune system support:** With its high concentration of antioxidants and [immune-supporting nutrients](https://worldsbestsupplements.com/collections/immune-support-supplements) like Vitamin C and Beta-carotene, Moringa can help your body remain strong against immune system stressors.
6. **May help detox processes:** Moringa has been studied for its potential detoxifying properties, in particular with how it helps the liver filter out harmful substances more efficiently.

# Why Choose Pure Moringa Leaf Capsules?

There are a LOT of Moringa products on the market, but as you’re probably aware, they aren’t all created equally. At World’s Best Supplements, we like to keep it pure and simple:

* 100% Pure Moringa Leaf Powder
* 400mg per Capsule (800mg per Serving)
* Vegan & Gluten-free
* Third-Party Tested - Quality Matters

Whether you are looking for a little energy boost throughout the day, seeking to balance blood sugars, or simply add antioxidant-rich nutrients to your daily intake, Pure Moringa Leaf Capsules from World’s Best Supplements are a great place to start.

Superior skull candles feature intricate detailing and are made from high-quality wax that ensures a clean and long burn. A well-crafted skull candle balances aesthetic appeal with functional performance.

**Wax Type:** High-quality skull candles are typically crafted from paraffin wax, soy wax, or beeswax. paraffin wax is cost-effective and allows for vibrant colors and strong fragrance retention, whereas soy wax is a natural and lasting option that burns cleaner and longer.Beeswax, although more expensive, offers a natural aroma and emits negative ions that purify the air. The best skull candle will select a wax type that harmonizes aesthetic aspiration, cost practicality and burn quality.

**Dimensions & Weight:** Skull candles come in varying sizes, from small accent pieces to large statement decorations.A larger candle will generally offer a longer burn time but might overwhelm a smaller space. The weight of the candle indicates the amount of wax used and, to an extent, the candle's stability. Common sizes range from 3 inches to over 8 inches in height, with weights varying from a few ounces to several pounds.

**Scent Profile:** Many skull candles are scented to enhance the ambiance they create. Popular scents include vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli, and cinnamon, reflecting the desire for warmth, earthiness, or spice. Unscented varieties cater to those sensitive to fragrances, thereby offering solely visual enjoyment. The quality of the fragrance oil is crucial, ensuring a pleasant aroma without being overbearing. The finest skull candles use natural essential oils rather than synthetic fragrances, creating pure and healthy effects.

**burn Time:** Burn time is a critical factor for evaluating the candle’s value. A skull candle utilizing higher-quality wax and a strategically placed wick will typically burn much longer. Burn times can vary substantially, ranging from 20 to 80 hours, depending on the candle's size and wax type. Slow, even burning prevents tunneling and maximizes the candle's lifespan, making it ideal for extended spooky experiences.

**Detailing & Design:** The most striking feature of a skull candle is its detailed design. From realistic anatomical accuracy to stylized artistic interpretations, the craftsmanship sets apart ordinary candles from extraordinary decor pieces. Intricate carvings, smooth finishes, and unique color variations enhance the candle’s visual appeal. Skull candles range from natural-looking variations to those with metallic, painted, or glitter accents.

1m8h4ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1m8h4ep/downstairs_neighbors_with_a_toddler_have_ruined/,Downstairs neighbor(s) with a toddler have ruined my homelife,"To set the stage, my partner and I have lived in our condo for almost 19 years. It used to be strictly 55 and older, until the HOA got lax with the owners (they're all owned separately). When we moved in, it was still mostly elderly. They've mostly moved or passed on at this point, but the condos have pretty much stayed kid-free for the last 19 years, save for a few kids here and there, but they never stay that long. Mainly due to the fact these condos aren't built for that type of activity. They're promoted towards retirees and working individuals or couples. Our building personally has never had kids.

Our long time neighbor who was a single guy, moved out in 2021, his condo was sold to this guy who has been running short term and problem tenants through the place constantly. Even his own daughter, who threw a rager college party we had to call the cops on and she lied and told her father that it was just ""a few friends"". Now because of that, he thinks we are making shit up.

Well the condo sat vacant for about 8 months until this past October, when this guy started to move in by himself. My partner spoke with him to let him know the place is pretty chill and quiet and everyone keeps to themselves. There are four units to a building, we've been there the longest, with an elderly guy across the hall that's been there for about a decade, and one relatively new woman who moved in about two months prior.

He told my partner that the place wasn't for him it was for his ""ex"". He said his landlord, ""The Indian guy"", told him about how bad noise travels and that she would be quiet. He said nothing about a kid. He moved in by himself for almost 2 months. Then in December at about 11pm, we had fallen asleep on our couch after watching tv, and we heard the door down stairs slam and a kid start running and squealing.

This has honestly been one of my worst nightmares realized. All the while, my mom just had a massive stroke (one she wouldn't recover from) and my partner's mom was also experiencing heart related issues and was in and out of the hospital

The next day (I WFH, which was told to this guy too), the kid is immediately screaming bloody murder. Then came the running and dropping and throwing toys at the walls and floors.

Then the stomping from both adults that rattles our floors and walls. I can't even sit and drink coffee on my couch in the mornings without feeling the god damned floor rumble up through it, because the idiot guy is chasing and wrestling his kid.

Mind you, we are on the top floor, but their unit does not have carpet, so we can hear EVERYTHING. It's never been this bad prior, as most of the other people were relatively quiet. Even after the girl threw her giant party, she went quiet.

Then the fighting and screaming between the adults started.

We recorded and documented everything. We took it to their landlord and our HOA, neither wanted to do jack shit. The recorded proof was severe and pretty much damning, specifically one fight where the woman AND the kid were screaming.

We have since called the cops on them twice. The first time, we were not at home and our Ring doorbell went off with the girl carrying the kid beating on our door saying ""PLEASE HE'S TRYING TO TAKE MY BABY!"" She didn't beat on anyone else's door, just ours. So we called the cops. We listened through the Ring to hear her not open the door to the deputy.

Well a few weeks ago, a day before my mother passed away, we had to call the cops again because the two of them started a fight out in the shared hallway. This is about the third fight where it started in the condo and bled out into the hallway. The first time we recorded it and sent it to their landlord. All he had to say was ""Huh, seems like they're going through something""...No shit you fucking idiot.

Other neighbors were home, but they are being passive aggressive with them, we aren't. We have shouted back, stomped back after being woken up for countless days on end, etc.

The guy tried to sweet talk his way out of it with the cop, he just told him to go outside while he talked to the girl. Nothing seemed to come of it and the deputy left.

The guy in this situation has priors for domestic offenses and child abuse. He was found guilty for the child abuse, but some how weaseled out of a bigger sentence. The girl looks like she's no older than 21 or something and doesn't have a car, refuses to take the kid outside. All she does is sit on the porch and not let the kid run around at all.

The guy is over here about 4 nights and two days a week. For a place that ""isn't his""...

They have absolutely ruined our quiet place to live. We can't afford to move at all and we can't afford to keep putting up with their bullshit.

We've contemplated contacting CPS, since every time he is here, they are fighting. Now he's playing loud music to try to cover up their fighting.

When I played loud music to cover up their bullshit? They banged on the ceiling. And he threatened up through the hallway multiple times, telling us to ""come down there and make them stop"" and ""i'll bring over a guitar and play it just as loud.""

We never wanted to play loud music as to not disturb the other established neighbors, but this has gone too far.

We have a TON of videos, all of which the shitty landlord of theirs has dismissed in some kind of way, or just straight up ignored.

I've posted this in Neighbors From Hell too.

Listen, we can hear our other neighbors from time to time, but never this loudly or frequently. This is EVERY GOD DAMNED DAY. It's affected both of our mental states. It's caused my TMJ to almost make my teeth break and I have a weight on my chest that feels like a black hole.

The day after my mother passed away, the kid was screaming bloody murder at 6:30 in the fucking morning. I beat on the floor and unloaded. I was so sick of their shit. We get no breaks. She just sits there and lets the kid scream and run back and forth. Occasionally SHE will scream at the kid to add fuel to the fire.

I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do. I also can't stand people just saying ""wear earplugs or headphones"". I can't because of my TMJ and that's not a fucking solution. This is our god damned home and these people have absolutely ruined every ounce of it. We wouldn't have stayed here for 19 years if we had a choice, but at least it was quiet. Now if feels like these people own it. We have to listen to their crotch spawn when we chose not to go down that path.

It's an actual living hell. We want to take them to small claims court but can't afford the god damned lawyer fees. The only other option is contacting the local police department to file a formal noise complaint and try to see if we can attach all the videos we have of the fighting and screaming and stomping.

I feel like I'm on the verge of a heart attack. I can't take my naps I was used to, to regulate myself. After my mom passed, my partner's mom got worse and had a seizure after a heart operation. She's out now, but not out of the woods. My work from home life has suffered immensely. It requires my to record my voice and I've had the kid's scream in the back ground more times than not.

I have no idea wtf to do, I just want these people gone or some kind of miracle for us, because this has been the worst nightmare and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.",9,1753393114.0,childfree,1,1.0,False

1m8h1qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1m8h1qc/i_built_a_powered_database_of_prog_rock_concerts/,I built a powered database of prog rock concerts across Europe — would love your feedback,"Hi everyone,  
I’m a guy from Sicily with a deep passion for progressive rock.

After attending the Dream Theater concert in Taormina a few weeks ago — and with Steve Hackett tickets ready for September — I found myself once again doing what I always do:  
digging across a dozen different websites, trying to figure out which prog shows were happening, and where.  
Every time, I ended up copy-pasting stuff into an Excel sheet… which always turned into chaos.

So I asked myself:

*“What if I could automate this? What if I could build something that just shows prog concerts — and nothing else?”*

That’s how **ProgDealer** was born.

It’s a simple site I built with a lot of love, and it’s my first proper web app project. The idea is to create a **clean, curated database of prog rock, prog metal, and alternative rock concerts and festivals across Europe.**

Every two weeks, the site scans sources like **Bandsintown** and **Concertful**, and automatically adds new events.  
These are filtered and classified using AI — so you only see events that are truly relevant to the progressive scene.

But my real hope is that it won’t just be automated:  
That it becomes something **community-powered**, where people can **sign up (even with Google)** and help by reporting new concerts, sharing tips, and shaping the platform together.

Right now you can:

* Browse upcoming events
* Filter by genre, city, or band
* Sign up and submit new concerts manually

Of course, I know there’s still a lot to fix and improve. I'm already working on:

* Improving the mobile layout
* Making filters more intuitive
* Fine-tuning the automatic imports

But beyond that, what I really need is **feedback** — on anything. What’s missing? What would make it better? What would *you* love to see in a platform like this?  
I'll soon add a **public roadmap** where I’ll list upcoming features and personally thank every user whose suggestions I end up implementing.

There are no ads, no distractions — just a small, community-driven project made by a prog fan, for other prog fans.  
There’s just a Buy Me a Coffee page if anyone ever feels like supporting this little effort

🔗 [https://progdealer.com](https://progdealer.com/)

And if by any chance there’s a fellow dev out there who also loves prog rock — the project is open-source on GitHub, and I’d absolutely welcome pull requests or contributions to help it grow: [https://github.com/mbarealbo/progdealer](https://github.com/mbarealbo/progdealer)

1m8h1l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m8h1l5/aita_i_had_a_falling_out_with_a_close_friend_and/,"AITA? I had a falling out with a close friend, and now my family is telling me that I was being too harsh","This story starts back around 2020 when I was in school and met one of my soon to be best friends. For storytelling purposes we will name this friend Xander. 

Xander(m) and I(f) became friends really easily and we got along really well. We were both into the same video games and shows so when we found out, we had a lot of classes together we became instantly best friends. before I met him I had never heard of Xander or seen him around, but after we became friends, he opened up to me about how he had a hard time making friends Because everyone assumed that he was gay. (he had a higher pitch speaking voice and didn’t find interest in the traditionally masculine things in our school.) 

Anyway, we did everything together once we were friends and it was safe to say that I was his only friend and he was my closest friend after a while, though we started accumulating more friends as a duo, which I didn’t have a problem with. I thought it was great that he was finally starting to make more friends considering he had a hard time with it. Eventually, the time came around where we were going to participate in a school musical and Xander had never even considered doing Theater before, but he wanted to because me, and all of his other new friends were going to do it.

After that show, he was never quite the same. He found a really healthy outlet for him to express himself and he absolutely loved doing Theater and I was super happy for him that he finally had this outlet to express himself, especially considering that his family life wasn’t great and he didn’t have a chance to express himself a lot at home. 

OK, fast forwarding a few years it’s now 2021-2025 and Xander was still one of my closest friends, but I didn’t see him as much anymore because he had become quite a social butterfly around the Theater department and I gradually grew out of Theater. I didn’t have a problem with him continuing Theater and I didn’t have a problem that he was super good friends with everyone else in the Theater department again I thought it was really great for him But overtime I noticed that he stopped putting as much effort into our relationship. I would text him and reach out to see if he wanted to do something, and that was usually met with him, casually blowing me off or him admitting that he was just not up for it. It really started to bother me when I would notice that I would invite him to do something he would cancel on me and he would go out with friends that very same night and usually when I confronted him about that he would say “oh this has been planned for weeks. I didn’t wanna cancel on them” or “oh this was really just a once in a time opportunity for me to go see those people”, so for about three years I put up with it.
With the exception of one time where he had canceled on me and I was not in a good headspace (mentally I was extremely manic and inebriated) and I did start a bit of a screaming match with him, which ended with him hanging up on our call and ignoring me for about two days until he finally reached back out to talk And when we did, it wasn’t about the main issue of him completely neglecting me and our friendship, but it was just about how it was irresponsible of me to demand those things from him when his time was valuable.  

OK now recently he had blown me off three times in one week and finally I had asked him if he wanted to go out for coffee with me to which he showed an interest in and asked follow up questions for times and when I responded, he never answered. I texted him around 1 PM, he answered then I texted again at about 1:10pm too no answer. Around 5 PM, I finally decided that this was stupid and I texted him never mind and that I was just going to go by myself. Around 11 PM that night, he finally texted me back saying that he never saw my other messages and that he completely forgot to respond. At first I wanted to believe him, but then I looked on his Snapchat story to find out that that entire time I was waiting, he was hanging around with his Theater friends and having fun mind you he was posting all throughout the day, so he was on his phone by the time my messages had gone through.

After he finally decided to respond to my text, he apologized a bunch and really wanted to check if I was doing OK, but I was honestly just so fed up at this point that I kind of tore into him a little bit. I won’t send my full message, but basically the gist of it was me telling him that I had been feeling extremely neglected in our friendship for these last couple of years and that for my own peace of mind, I was going to need to take a step back because I could tell that this was damaging for me. 

Now this is the part of the story where I might’ve been a bit too harsh, he met my angry text with a barrage of apologies and how he was in a bad headspace and how his break up was affecting him, (even though his break up only lasted this year and this has been going on for a total of about five years now.) Regardless, he apologized and said that he would do better but right after he apologized he admitted that he wished that I would’ve told him sooner because he had no idea. 

This got me so heated that I immediately sent a message back saying “how dare you tell me that I should’ve spoken up sooner. If you claim to love me like your own sister, (which he did say Word for Word in one of his apology texts) then I shouldn’t of had to spell out my pain for you if you claim to care that much. This is all been extremely difficult for me and the last thing I need is the reason of all my pain telling me excuses as to why it happened. not to mention this is not the first time we’ve argued about this topic and you wanna tell me you never saw anything coming?” 

He again apologized profusely, but he stuck by his point. At the end of our conversation, it was basically me, begging him to take some accountability for his actions and promise that they won’t happen again and him constantly telling me that he has taken accountability and that it’s not his fault that he didn’t see what was happening. The place were currently in is that he is sorry and he wants to make things better but he isn’t willing to move on past his defense mode and realize how much he actually hurt me and that’s why I’m still so frustrated with him. I don’t like to brag, but I was raised in an extremely emotionally round home, and I learned how to properly apologize and handle situations like this from a young age, but on the flipside of that, I have to deal with people who don’t know how to respond to these situations and that’s exactly what he’s been doing in my life.

 I have become extremely empathic. It’s very easy for me to put myself in other people’s shoes and understand where they’re coming from and all I want is for him to realize where I’m coming from in this situation and he is just not Understanding that. I’ve told him outright that that’s what I want him to do and his response every time is “I already have”.

I shared this with my family and they were saying that I was too harsh on him and that he was apologizing, and I should just be grateful that he is doing that at the very least. This kind of struck me the wrong way because I was expecting my family to be on my side and understand that he can’t treat me like this and expect everything to go back to the way it was but no they instead sided with Xander completely and told me that I was in the wrong for constantly telling him how much he hurt me.

For context, my family absolutely adores him. They know that he doesn’t have a great family life so we would always do little things for him for example, when he won the school science fair and no one was there to congratulate him me and my family took him out for dinner and made him feel special. 

I also feel like it’s important to mention that anytime we have a fight. I ask him to keep it between us because he is so popular. He often spreads our business to people who have no place knowing about it and when I asked him if he had told anyone about our fight specifically after I asked him not to he at first told me that he didn’t tell anyone but then admitted that he told one of his really close friends in theater and I’m not sure if she told anyone else but I’m frustrated with him regardless.

I worked at a place with Miss Wright, firstname Always.  Although she was a coworker, not our supervisor, she knew the correct and only way to do things.  Everything.  This made her a popular item of discussion, but not popular among us. 

We tolerated her as best we could, but enjoyed giving her subtle tweaks.  She was an orderly individual, very neat, and everything had to be just right.  It wasn't ""oh, she has ocd, humor her""; more like ""the stapler goes here, and only here.  Oh, your stapler is wrong, let me fix that for you.""  So of course the first person in the office in the morning might accidentally switch two books on her shelf, or stack her inbox underneath the outbox.  If she asked about it, someone would suggest that perhaps the cleaning crew moved it, or that she was mistaken.

This was decades ago; we had desks, not cubicles, our desks had phones, and paper was the primary storage and communication media.  Our office had copiers and printers and scanners; none of that newfangled multifunction stuff.  The other department in our building published and managed technical documents the size of phone books.  (Wow, I am out of date; imagine 500 - 1500 page manuals).  They had printers the size of small cars to produce these manuals.  The repo room included several triple-drill press machines for cutting holes in the manuals so they could be put in binders.

One time, Miss Wright decided to rearrange a coworker's desk.  Nothing really bad, since everything was in folders or organizers, but still weird.  That was the straw that broke that camel's back.  Much later, the coworker got his revenge.  He went to the repo room, and came back with a coffee cup full of the holes punched from the manuals.  He covered an 11"" x 17"" piece of paper with a layer of the holes, removed Miss Wright's center desk drawer, and taped one edge of the paper to the drawer, then carefully replaced it.

Sometime later, Miss Wright sat down, opened her drawer, and dumped generous portion of holes all over her lap.  When she noticed, she stood up, spreading the holes even more.

Here is the coworker's true genius.  For months afterwards, every few days, he'd sprinkle a few holes around her desk when she was away from it.  She went nuts trying to figure out where they were coming from - taking out the drawers, looking underneath it, shuffling through the books on her shelf.",21,1753392663.0,pettyrevenge,3,1.0,False

I Love You, It Ruins Me

Chapter 1
I have been with Morgan Prescott for three years, and I've had three miscarriages.
During the fourth one, he was at home, kneeling and coaxing his beloved crush.
""You should move out and rest for a while,"" he said without a trace of guilt. ""Elise doesn't want to see you. Try not to bother us if there's nothing urgent.
""Oh, and she said your chicken soup was really good. Learn a few more dishes—you'll take care of her from now on.""
Clutching my medical report, I nodded obediently.
As I reached the door, I overheard his friends laughing.
""Damn, Morgan, you've really got her trained.""
Morgan boasted proudly, ""I've worn her out in bed, and she's miscarried multiple times. Who else would even want her?
""Even if I never marry her, she'll still care for me and Elise.""
I didn't say a word. I just pulled out my phone and typed a single sentence.
""I've lost. Let's meet at City Hall tomorrow afternoon.""
***
He replied instantly. ""Whoever's late is the loser.
""I won't give you a chance to back out.""
Attached was a property transfer agreement marked, Voluntary Gift.
""They say a house is a girl's sense of security. I hope you feel safe now.""
As I read those words, my eyes welled up with tears.
Morgan caught the glint of moisture in my eyes and barked out a warning.
""Don't get clingy. If you piss off Elise, I'll make you pay for it.""
A shiver ran down my spine. I couldn't help but think back to my first miscarriage.
I had been lying in a hospital bed gripping the test results while crying like a child.
I'd stubbornly believed that I was young, healthy, and active—miscarriage wasn't possible.
He got so furious that he locked me in a room and 'disciplined' me for three days and nights. I nearly passed out from exhaustion.
This time, I kept my emotions in check and forced a smile.
""Congratulations. Elise finally agreed to come back to you.""
Morgan seemed satisfied.
""I won't marry you, but if you behave, I'll support you for life.
""And remember, don't ever upset Elise.""
I'd heard that same line a hundred times over the past three years.
At first, his precious Elise Drake rejected him for being poor.
So I poured my inheritance—1.5 million left by my parents—into helping him start his business.
He said he loved me and was grateful. Then he turned around and proposed to her with a twenty-carat pink diamond.
She took the diamond and still turned him down.
Soon after, I had another miscarriage.
Once Morgan finally won her over, he couldn't wait to show me her photos.
""Her body, her touch, she's a hundred thousand times better than you.""
And from there, it all spiraled.
They went camping, got romantic, and had me climb over a mountain in a thunderstorm just to bring them umbrellas.
Elise heard him say something gently to me—just one line—and she exploded.
He made me bow and slap myself to apologize.
Too slow?
Voice too soft?
Any slight misstep, and he'd kick me out of the house.
Then, when he needed my inheritance again, he'd graciously let me return.
Over and over again, until I'd gone numb.
I walked toward the door, my mind blank.
Then I heard Elise's voice snap, full of anger.
""I told you I liked her emerald bracelet, and yet you didn't give it to me—are you still hung up on her?""
""Don't be ridiculous,"" Morgan said hurriedly. ""I promise that bracelet will be on your wrist by tonight.""
He stormed into the storage room where I lived, dug through a fancy box, and gently slipped the bracelet onto her wrist.
I rushed forward to stop him, but he shoved me hard. My forehead slammed against the corner of a table, and blood poured down my face.
Elise instantly yanked off the bracelet and threw it to the floor. It shattered into pieces.
""Pathetic little tramp, always pretending to be pitiful just to seduce Morgan.""
Morgan carefully calmed her down, whispering sweet nothings until she finally relented.
He promised to buy her a crystal crown once worn by the Queen of Denmark at tomorrow's auction—and only then would she let it go.
My vision blurred with tears. I knelt on the ground, individually picking up the broken pieces of the bracelet.
It had been my mother's. Her last wish was for me to wear it when I married the man I loved.
Suddenly, Morgan slapped me across the face. My head spun, stars filled my vision, and my mind went blank.
""This is your fault—Elise is upset again. If you can't keep her happy, don't dream of setting foot in the Prescott family ever again!""
At those words, I trembled uncontrollably.
It wasn't him I couldn't let go of—it was the fear of his punishment.
There had been a time when I'd refused to massage Elise's feet.
She got angry and moved to the guest room.
Morgan lost his temper and ordered the maids to hold me down while he forced shoes filled with needles onto my feet.
I fainted from the pain several times, yet he fought with Elise until dawn.
He refused to let me go to the hospital. He made the maid clean my wounds with salt water.
Terrified, I lowered my head and groveled to Elise.
""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have upset you.""
Before I could finish, Morgan raised his foot and stomped down hard on my hand.
Shards of the bracelet stabbed into my skin, drawing blood. I broke into a cold sweat, my whole body shaking.
He finally lifted his foot and spat on the ground.
""Barely stepped on you, and you're already whining? So dramatic.
""Ugh, you're disgusting. Just pack your things and get out. Don't stink up the place.""
Then he turned and bent down gently, scooping Elise into his arms while leaving me bleeding on the floor.
Chapter 2
I stumbled my way to the hospital, barely staying on my feet.
I heard Morgan's voice echoing from down the hall just as I arrived.
""Camila's healthy, she'll be fine. But Elise just got pregnant and fainted—you all need to give her a thorough check-up. Make sure both she and the baby are alright, no matter what.""
Not long after, Morgan burst into my hospital room, face twisted in rage as he pointed at me and started shouting.
""Damn you! Elise finally got pregnant with my child, and you deliberately upset her to jeopardize it? If anything happens to her or the baby, I'll skin you alive!""
I nodded quietly, saying nothing.
But in my mind, I was back in the past, I listened to their conversation from outside the room after I lost my first child.
Back then, Elise hadn't even accepted his confession yet.
""If she has the baby, you'll focus on her, not me. I'll be the one left behind.""
To keep her from leaving, Morgan had put abortion medication in my soup.
""She's just a tool—a free maid who earns me money and cooks and cleans. She's not worthy of carrying my child. Only you are.""
Because of the drug, I hemorrhaged badly. While I was hanging onto life in the hospital, the two of them were playing lovers on a private couple's island overseas, indulging in passion like it was a honeymoon.
Elise even sent me a photo—an umbrella I had once used laid beside an empty pack of birth control pills.
""Morgan was too rough. I'm still sore. And now he's coming back again after his shower.""
When I learned the truth, I broke down crying over and over again all alone.
I tried to threaten Morgan into sending her away, but he called me childish and irrational.
All I could do was watch them flirt day after day, helpless and humiliated.
And yet, I still clung on. I couldn't admit I'd lost the man I loved. I refused to accept defeat.
Seeing me being obedient again, Morgan handed me a bowl of medicine.
I reached for it, but my arm burned with pain.
He said it calmly like it was no big deal.
""Elise's fetus is unstable. Human flesh and blood are nourishing. Think of it as you atoning for your sins.""
I stared at him, stunned. I couldn't believe what I'd just heard.
Then came the slap, hard and sudden.
""You upset her, endangered her and the baby. It's just a bit of meat—why are you acting pitiful?""
My head spun, ears ringing. I staggered, reaching for the call button.
But someone seized my wrist tightly and hard.
""Elise is weak right now. She needs all the medical attention.
""Your wounds are bandaged. Don't try to get the doctors away so you can hurt her.""
Blood seeped through the gauze, staining it red.
A nurse rushed in. ""Ms. Drake is feeling dizzy again. She says she wants more of the soup you just gave her.""
Without hesitation, Morgan ripped off my bandage and grabbed a fruit knife from the table. He aimed at my arm again.
Thinking of Elise, unconscious against his shoulder, his eyes filled with pain and affection.
""Don't worry, Elise. She's got plenty of meat. It'll help you recover.""
The doctor, alarmed, quickly intervened.
""That's a dangerous rumor. Human flesh and blood aren't restorative. And her arm is already severely injured. Cut it again and it'll be permanently disabled.""
Morgan sped up.
""Then it's disabled. Consider it her penance to Elise.
""She'll be slower doing chores, sure, but I'll let her stay. Give her just enough food to survive.""
To keep things 'fresh and clean', he wouldn't even allow anesthesia.
As I fainted from the pain, he patted my swollen face gently, looking deeply satisfied.
""You owed Elise. Now your debt's paid. No more guilt, alright?""
Elise, who had just arrived, let out a dissatisfied hum.
Immediately, he rushed over to her side, cradling her carefully, speaking in the softest voice.
He massaged her waist, rubbed her back, and promised her custom jewelry and designer gowns—all without hesitation.
He didn't glance at me once.
Until the soft ding of a text message cut through the lovers' sweet whispers.
Chapter 3
When I saw the familiar profile picture on my phone, the pain in my body didn't seem quite as intense anymore.
I quickly tapped out a reply.
As I looked up, I met Morgan's dark, suspicious eyes.
""Who messaged you?""
""The rental agent.""
He believed me without a doubt.
He even urged me to settle it quickly and stop hanging around the house all day, saying it would disturb Elise while she was resting for the pregnancy.
In his mind, I couldn't be in contact with any other man.
After we got together, he said he'd get jealous and heartbroken if he saw me talking to another guy.
So I cut off all contact with the outside world and devoted every moment to him and the house chores.
I ignored the two of them, still flirting and laughing in the room, and walked out with my phone.
I barely took a few steps before the world spun violently.
Just as I was about to fall, Morgan reached out and caught me, only to suddenly think of something and pull his hand back, letting me crash to the floor.
""Um, Elise wants to go to the auction. Do you want to come with us?""
""No.""
I refused without hesitation.
Not long ago, he'd said it had been ages since we went out together and invited me to an art exhibit.
Only when I arrived did I realize Elise had deliberately orchestrated the whole thing.
She wanted me, haggard and unkempt like a live-in maid, to walk beside her and highlight her beauty and elegance.
I turned to leave.
Morgan snatched my phone and threw it into the swimming pool.
Then he left me empty-handed in an isolated, high-end neighborhood surrounded by private orchards and far from the city.
I barely escaped becoming prey to a wild animal. It had taken everything I had just to survive.
There was no way I was going back with him this time.
He seemed displeased by my coldness, frowning instinctively.
But after noticing how unsteady I was on my feet, he held back the words of reproach.
""Then just stay home and rest. We'll see you when we get back.""
I'm not waiting anymore.
I forced a pale smile and nodded.
Then I went to check myself out of the hospital.
Everyone was busy fussing over Elise. I waited a long, long time before I finally saw a doctor.
While handling my discharge paperwork, he gently suggested I stay a few more days to recover.
When I refused, he listed out a series of precautions, reminding me to take care of myself and rest well.
He was still mid-sentence when someone snatched the documents from his hand and threw them at me. Then they dragged him aside and whispered harshly.
""Why waste your energy worrying about her? Everyone knows she's just Mr. Prescott's dog. That one inside is the real future, Mrs. Prescott.
""She's pregnant now. This one's about to be kicked out. Why bother with her anymore?""
Elise had dealt with anyone who ever stood up for me.
I didn't want to harm innocent people anymore, so I quietly picked up the scattered documents and left without a word.
Outside, night had already fallen.
I saw a drone light show—it was Morgan's dramatic public love declaration for Elise.
People watched in awe and admiration.
""I heard the CEO of Prescott Group's wife is pregnant. He's throwing a huge proposal tonight, and they're planning a grand wedding soon. He even bought the island where they first fell in love to keep as a memento.
""Rich people really do know how to romance.""
At the thought of my three lost children, pain gripped my chest.
""Wait, it gets better.
""Mr. Prescott will spend three days and nights praying to ensure the pregnancy goes smoothly.
""She's just barely pregnant, and he's already acquired several maternity and baby care companies. Imagine how spoiled that child's going to be.
""Did you hear? He just invested in ten orphanages to bless her and the baby!""
He couldn't wait to declare his joy to the whole world, to show everyone how deeply he loved Elise.
And I found it laughable.
The first time I miscarried, I cried every day.
I begged him to come to the hospital with me to find out what had caused me to lose the baby.
He scolded me for being dramatic.
""I asked him to hire a priest to bless the baby's soul.""
He said I was insane.
Then he turned around and arranged a full suite of prenatal care for Elise, checking her, pampering her, and doing everything he could to ensure she conceived.
Morgan didn't believe in prayers or blessings.
He just never thought I was worth it.
I don't even remember how I dragged my broken body back home that night.
When Morgan returned, I was rifling through drawers looking for my documents, next to a half-packed suitcase.
He noticed how pale I looked, and for once, his voice was unusually gentle.
""Elise needs to stay in the hospital for a few more days. You can move out before she comes back.
""Just rest for tonight, alright?""
I shook my head numbly. My swollen face throbbed with pain at the motion.
""Ms. Drake is pregnant now. I wouldn't dare disturb her.
""Just give me the inheritance my parents left me. I won't take anything else.""
There was a flicker of resistance in his eyes.
I explained calmly, ""The Prescott Group is worth billions now. There's no need to upset Ms. Drake over a few million. She probably hates that she sees traces of me everywhere she turns in this house.""
After I finished, he went to the study, pulled out some wrinkled, yellowed documents, and handed them to me.
""Elise spilled coffee on them once. It didn't ruin them or anything.""
I wiped the papers gently with my sleeve, but the stains wouldn't come off.
Morgan scowled and snapped at me.
""What's your problem? Elise didn't do it on purpose. She already feels bad about it. How dare you blame her?
""I'm warning you—if you try to turn her against me, I'll make sure you regret ever being born.""
Tears slipped from the corners of my eyes. I raised my sleeve and wiped them away.
""You misunderstood. I just thought of my parents.""
Love is like gambling.
And I lost.
Those few million can't compare to the Prescott Group's empire today.
But it was everything my parents worked for, everything they left behind to ensure I lived a safe, happy life.
Their love shouldn't be trampled on.
It was the first time I cried in front of him without yelling or begging—just calm, quiet tears.
He seemed flustered, caught completely off guard.
Chapter 4
""You can stop pretending to be pitiful. If it means that much to you, I'll pay you back. It's not even that much money.""
Before he could take out his phone, Elise called.
She was whimpering on the phone, saying she was scared of being alone.
""Elise's timid—and she's just found out she's pregnant. She's extra sensitive right now. I need to go.
""It's already late. Don't bother moving out tonight—pack your things tomorrow morning instead. Elise says she's craving chicken soup, don't forget to bring it to her.""
I didn't respond. I took my things and went back to my room.
The next morning, my phone kept ringing non-stop.
Morgan demanded to know why I hadn't delivered the chicken soup on time and said I'd upset Elise.
Then he followed up with. ""Forget it. You're not feeling well anyway. Get some rest. I'm taking Elise to the auction. You can pack up later.""
The rest of the messages weren't from him.
""I'm waiting for you outside the City Hall.""
""You promised. No backing out.
""Did you eat yet? I brought your favorite spaghetti.
""Still not up?
""Don't tell me you're going soft on that bastard and changed your mind.""
During the three years of being together, this was the first time he'd ever considered me.
But I didn't want it anymore.
I blocked his number without hesitation.
I packed up everything my parents left me and walked out with my suitcase.
Right as I stepped out, Morgan got out of his car and stormed over, kicking me hard in the chest. I fell to the ground.
Still not satisfied, he began punching and kicking me furiously.
""You keep going on about your parents' inheritance, but all you wanted was that crown Elise liked. You deliberately upset her!
""I was going to use that crown to propose to her! And now you've ruined everything!
""From this day forward, don't even think about setting foot in the Prescott family again. Don't even dream of seeing me!""
Even after that, his rage wasn't spent.
He ordered people to douse my suitcase in gasoline and set it on fire himself.
I ignored the pain in my body and rushed toward the flames, trying to save what I could.
But a dozen servants blocked me, forcing me to stand there and watch everything my parents worked for burn to ash.
When the fire finally went out, they let me go.
I ran over, scooping up the still-warm ashes in my hands, sobbing uncontrollably.
Elise put on a show of 'comforting' me, but in reality, she pressed hard on my bleeding wounds.
""Did you think stealing the crown would break us up?
""We're getting married today. You'll never take Morgan from me.""
Before leaving, Morgan kicked me again in disgust—and even spat on me.
I dragged myself up and went to the hospital to get my wounds bandaged.
Elise kept sending me photos, bragging about how much Morgan adored her.
I casually tossed my phone into a storm drain and headed to the City Hall.
When I arrived, the man who had been waiting for me immediately handed me our marriage certificate and slipped a custom pink diamond ring onto my finger. He even placed the freshly won crystal crown on my head.
""Now you can't run away.
""Let's go home.""
Morgan walked out of the building with Elise in his arms, holding their marriage certificate.
""You really have no shame, chasing us here!""
I held up my own certificate and cut him off.
""Relax. I'm here to get married too.""",1,1753392642.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

My 4-year-old and I stopped by Dunkin’ in Peoria Heights early this morning to grab some donuts and drinks before starting our day. The front parking spot (not a handicap space) was open, so naturally, I parked there.

As we were walking out, an older woman stormed past us muttering, “Of course you park in the closest spot and have nowhere to be.” I replied, “Yikes, let’s calm down…”

When she came back outside a minute later, I called out, “I hope your day gets better!” Without missing a beat, she fired back, “You too, breeder!” I said, “Excuse me?!” and she added, “You and your crotch goblin!”

All I could say was, “Wow. How embarrassing to speak to a total stranger like that.” She jumped into her suv—which, was parked maybe 10 feet farther away than mine—and sped off like a Fast & Furious extra.

Seriously… what even was that?!

Edit: Just to be clear, no shade toward this Dunkin’ location. We love this spot and come here all the time. Unhinged strangers are usually not included.

I use rapeh kinda instead of cigarettes. I have managed to quit smoking with the help of rapeh and sustain it (in the past I couldn't sustain because nicotine has a lovely effect on my body). I am aware that I have still an addiction to nicotine, but it is nothing compared to cigarettes.  

I think the mindset that rapeh needs to be administered exclusively in a specific ceremonial setting (like, what even is a ceremonial setting? Time set aside for introspection, embellished with christals and whatnot?), only in a meditative state, with the intention to gain deep knowledge from grandfather spirit is a bit OCD.  

Admitting to using rapeh instead of cigarettes comes with a sense of shame and feeling of being 'less' in the ego 'spiritual' competition. I have met many people who clearly use rapeh for the cigarette reasons but God forbid they will think about themselves in this way. This annoys me. 

I think that cigarettes are also consumed in a ceremonial setting. You take the 7minutes it takes to smoke one to sit with yourself in peace and to contemplate, or to socialise with others and feel more connected. At least this is how I used cigarettes. The only thing wrong with that is burning your lungs (and other health stuff) and not being able to self regulate purely by yourself..  

Hat down to anyone who is able to self regulate and be free purely by self will, and from that space manages to use rapeh free of getting addicted to nicotine. To be able not to get addicted to stuff is a great sign of a healthy psyche. 

I don't want to pretend I am free and have such a strong psyche, I haven't, I am a flawed person.

I love rapeh but I use it in various settings. I use it when I'm out socialising, I use it at work, I use it after drinking coffee to take a s*it, I use it for meditation, I use it to calm down my nervous system in various settings. 

Why wouldn't this be sacred? For something to be sacred, does it need to be perfect, healed, deeply connected? If it's not healed (like reason for my use of cigarettes, and rapeh), but made aware, is it then 'sacred enough'? Am I disrespecting the medicine of rapeh? Why? Because I am not healed? Because I use it for settings decided as not appropriate by other people?

But I just don't know what changes I'm supposed to feel. I don't know what side effects are red flags. Subreddits are kinda scaring me. I'm trying to do reading on it but this is a brain medication so there's no one size fits all advice and I'm just overwhelmed with all the opinions and ideas. 

People say the generic doesn't do anything - if I go to the brand name it will be way more expensive and I'm already on a bunch of other meds for depression and anxiety. I was very irrationally angry the other day and I'm not usually like that so now I'm thinking: is the Vyvanse making me irritable? Is that going to go away or do I need to stop it? Am I going to feel spaced out? Will I lose interest in stuff? Where's the crash people talk about? Why am I still so sleepy and tired? Some people open the capsules and dissolve them - should I be doing that? Should I be taking some in the morning some in the afternoon? How long do I wait before I start experimenting with the *how* I'm taking the meds? 

I have to change my lifestyle. I have to do things to let the medication help me. I don't eat very well. I struggle to get enough protein in my diet. I probably have an eating disorder like ARFID (which I'm going to get treated for as of tomorrow). So the basic things of eating good food and exercise are very hard for me. Should this medication not help me get motivation to make lifestyle changes? I'm looking for a cure that isn't there, I know. Like I know that \*I\* have to do work too. I just am very lost and scared. My psychiatrist is unapproachable and unhelpful. He has told me to my face he doesn't think I have ADHD yet prescribed it anyways because I am tired I think? He says ""I don't treat the diagnosis, I treat the symptoms."" It's my therapist that believes I have ADHD. And also everyone else in my life. But I can't get advice from my doctor. So idk when or if I should start trying to change the way I take it. 

This post is a mess and kinda just me venting tbh. ",1,1753392397.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False
1m8gtdb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8gtdb,Am I overreacting for deciding to move out?,"I (23F) have lived with two roommates since December of 2023. One of them, let’s call her Sam (24F) I lived with in September of 2023, and we moved in with her mom Carol (?F) - When mine and Sam’s lease was up we moved in with her mom because she lost some roommates and it worked out for us. I was warned going into it that Carol was controlling and overbearing. But I dismissed it because I had dealt with that in my family in the past. We move in and everything’s fine. 
Carol nit picks little things, like:
- Putting my friends coffee maker on the counter because Carol won’t use it (but we will,) and not using the butter dish (I have no clue why.) 
- A couple weeks ago I put a can and poured grease into it and put it on the windowsill above the sink because I was going to use it again, and two days later it was thrown away. 
- In our roommate agreement she put that we can only have “one overnight guest a week.” Which is just crazy, I’ve dealt with it and managed to get around it sometimes, but she’s allowed people all the time, and I pay the same amount of rent as everyone else and that’s a restriction I’ve had to deal with. 
Another time I got passive aggressively talked to because I used the rice maker and left the rice in it overnight. 
- I put things up on my ceiling and used push pins and she made a passive aggressive comment and told me to never do it again when I first moved in and started decorating. 
- Another thing, I have to park on the street where I live, and I drove a friend to the airport snd let them park next to me (room for 2 cars,) and she sent me another passive aggressive text about not having cars stay in that spot long term (they were gone for a week.) even though nobody owns that spot on the street, she thinks she has claim idk. 
- Then around thanksgiving she told me to take all of my freezer items out of our deep freezer so she can put 5, yes FIVE whole turkeys in there. No notice, gave me 3 days to figure something out (shoutout to my mom for letting me use her freezer for a bit.) 
- There have been many more instances with her, and she leaves sticky notes in the house where she needs to control everything, she literally has one above our washer that said “NO dirt, sand, mud, blankets or shoes in the washer/dryer. Go to a laundromat” - like girl what? Isn’t that what home W/D are for? She also sent a text about it which I’ll add to this post. I’ve been miserable since last year living here, but it’s convenient enough that I stay to save up. 

The thing that finally broke me however was this text (see pic.) For reference when I moved in I had to sign a roommate agreement and I was fine with that, and in it I have access to common areas (living rooms, kitchen, dining room,) my shared bathroom with my friend, and my room (which is the smallest in the house.) When I moved in she gave my friend (her daughter,) and myself one closet in the upstairs living room to split. I’m not allowed to have items in the garage unless it’s outdoorsy items. 
Then literally yesterday she sends me this text (first photo,) as I’m leaving a clients house. I left the house without locking the door (we live in a really safe dead end,) for 20 mins and was going to be back. Well, she came home during that time and sent that text. I never leave things in the garage besides my paddleboard, a sleeping bag, and a cooler. I have a camping trip coming up mid August and had to go grab my camping gear from my mom’s storage unit before she had it all moved. So I brought home a giant storage tote, a little camp stove, and a larger cooler. I tucked them away in the pile my roommate has where I’m allowed to keep my 3 things. Thought it would be fine, then this is what triggered the text. I have no idea why I’m getting kicked out of the closet, they’re there for storage (that one specifically for both my roommate and I so wtf) it’s never been an issue the entire time I’ve lived here so why is it now coming up?

So with the new changes I’m being forced to get a storage unit for my things. I have no other location to store things if it’s not my room. I’ve never been allowed space in the garage, any closets downstairs, or any common storage spaces. 

Also more background: We have one of Carols friends moving in soon, and my friend is being shipped off to the border in late September (she’s in the military.)

I also can’t have any effective conversations with her about the things she says/does that impact me negatively because she twists it, and makes me feel worse. I want to stand up to her but I’m just done with her and how she treats me. I’m just someone she gets money from. I pay close to $700 for rent plus utilities  so I give her roughly $700-$900 a month for a 10x10 room with a small walk in closet (again it’s the smallest room in the house.) Whereas my friend pays the same amount, but gets a 15x12 room, large walk in closet, two closets in our upstairs living room, and half a wall in the garage, she also gets to use her nieces playroom for her stuff too so yeah.. I understand they’re related but for the amount I’m paying it’s insane the differences between myself and my friend for the same amount of money. 

So with all of this, I talked to my mom (55F) and we decided it’s best if I move out. So I’m going to move in with her next month as her caregiver (she’s lives in a 55+ community so it’s the only way I’d be able to)

I’m going to use the storage unit excuse to pack up and move as much stuff out as I can before the 10th that aren’t things I use regularly (bed, tv, computer, clothes) I have some friends coming over Monday to help me move most of my stuff to her unit so that’ll lower my stress levels a lot thankfully 

I don’t want to burn any bridges or have it be ugly when I move out as well. I haven’t given my 30 days or told either of them yet, I’m going to do that next week so I have more time to get everything out and sorted.

1m8gpwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1m8gpwm/my_personal_experience_with_panic_attacks_and/,My Personal Experience with Panic Attacks and Anxiety,"I’m a young man in my early twenties, and I’d like to share my story with panic attacks and anxiety—hoping that someone might help me, understand me, or guide me toward healing.

About two weeks ago, I went through a terrifying and unexpected experience:
I had consumed coffee and an energy drink, and then I suddenly started feeling intense heart palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, and a strong feeling that I was going to die. My heart rate shot up to 145 bpm. I was rushed to the emergency room, where they checked me and ran an ECG. They told me everything was fine.
But I wasn’t fully convinced—because the feeling was too intense and strange.

Since that moment, I’ve been living in a state of fear and anxiety—not always as strong, but I feel like I’m no longer myself.
Sometimes I feel like I’m in a dream, or disconnected from myself, as if something bad is about to happen.
My heart starts racing out of nowhere, I get intrusive thoughts about death, and my mind becomes overwhelmed with disturbing thoughts.

I’ve been visiting doctors repeatedly, and they all say my heart is fine, my blood pressure is normal, and my tests look good.
Even a psychiatrist told me, “You’re experiencing panic attacks,” and advised me to stay calm and patient.
Right now, I no longer feel the same level of terror as in the beginning—but I also don’t feel fully at peace.
It’s as if something inside me is unsettled. I’m “functioning” normally, but I don’t feel completely okay.
Sometimes I think a lot about death, and I feel a hidden fear inside me that I can’t explain.

I’m not just looking for medication…
I’m seeking understanding. I’m searching for a way to live in peace, for mental comfort, and for inner stability.

Please, if you’ve been through a similar experience, or if you know effective ways to deal with this condition, share them with me.
May God reward you and bless everyone who reads and helps me.

I had 2 fizzy drinks, a water and coffee.
A month ago I would have ordered beers and we would have gotten drunk together. My friend had beers but didn't comment on me not having any alcohol. ( Wich I thought he would do before meeting up).

I am now in doubt about ordering NA beers in the future. I dont think they taste that good, but I think I like the atmosphere of ""drinking"" together with friends. 
But maybe this is a bad idea because it might be an halfway measure wich could lead me to wanting/drinking real beer again. Maybe it is to early for me experimenting with beer, even if it is NA.

Can any of you relate to these doubts? What are your experiences with NA beers or mocktails? 
Any advice or guidance is greatly appreciated.

1m8gmk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1m8gmk3/my_story_about_caffeine_and_its_relation_to/,My story about Caffeine and it's relation to Anxiety,"First off, I just want to say that I have been a lurker in this sub reddit for many years, but have rarely posted. My anxiety woes go all the way back to when I was a kid in the 80s, unable to get up in the morning and go to school due to frequent stomach aches. My parents thought I just had a sour stomach, turns out social anxiety was likely the cause. Although it took me years of therapy, self reflection and work to finally figure that out about myself as an adult. 

In 2008, my grandmother died which created a sort of crisis in my life. I began having panic attacks and also became agoraphobic. I had to take Xanax to even be able to leave the house. I was trying to manage a retail store at the time as well which was stressful and likely also resulted in this ""breakdown"". For so many years I resisted taking medication, I wanted to try and deal with it myself. But I knew how dangerous Xanax was with prolonged use. So I bit the bullet and decided to try Lexapro. And honestly? It saved my life. It didn't completely eliminate the fear and dread, but it helped me mange it better and for the first time in my life, I was starting to feel ""normal"". Or at least what I figured was normal. I was getting on airplanes with my wife and traveling (things I had refused to do before). I started my own business and did well. But then in 2020, Covid hit... and the dread began to return.

During all this time, one thing had remained a constant. I was a caffeine addict. I knew I was, I had no illusions to it. I went through phases though. I ""quit"" a couple of times during the worst of my panic attack episodes, although not really. I always had my caffeine, even if it was just slightly less. And especially after Covid hit, I just kept going to it more and more to cope. To the point where I was drinking between 400-800mgs of Caffeine a day. I was functional on this dosage too, not always anxious. But when the anxiety hit? It was horrific and worse than ever. The Lexapro didn't seem to be doing much for me anymore. So in 2024, I decided I wanted to try to go off my meds. The more I reduced my meds though, the more dread and despair I felt. All the while still drinking obscene amounts of caffeine. 

Here's what a typical day would look like for me: I'd start with Califia cold brew coffee in the morning. That coffee has around 190mgs of caffeine in a 12oz serving. I'd have two of them before I even went out the door. Then around noon I'd stop at Starbucks usually and get a Nitro Cold Brew (280mgs of caffeine), or an energy drink at a gas station (200mgs in a small Celsius, 400 in a large). Then later in the afternoon it was a diet soda (Around 50mgs). Then when I got home sometimes, I'd have a coke zero from my fridge (34mgs). Granted, it wasn't this crazy every day, but a lot of days it was. I recently calculated the amount of caffeine in each of those drinks and I was absolutely astounded.

For the last 10 years, I noticed that my sleep had started to deteriorate, which was also feeding my anxiety. I am naturally a night Owl. But it had gotten so bad that I was tossing and turning all night every night. I could fall asleep, but I couldn't stay asleep. I never could really figure out why... except that the answer is now obvious.

Back in January, I had a crisis in my life like no other I have ever had. While I won't go into a lot of details, it's the type of thing that changes your life forever. My anxiety came roaring back like never before. Panic Attacks, constant dread and worry, the pit of my stomach a knot, feeling like I could vomit at any moment. I knew the anxiety was coming from this horrific event in my life, but at the same time, I felt like I just couldn't manage it like I used to be able to do. And after 6 months of this, one day about a month ago out of desperation, I decided to pull the plug on caffeine and see what happens. 

I didn't think I was going to be able to function without it. I had been a caffeine addict for my entire adult life. But I said ""fuck it"" and quit cold turkey. That first week was horrific, let me tell you. I felt strung out, groggy and miserable. So on week 2, I decided to introduce a little bit of Matcha Green Tea in the morning to help with the headaches. I've always like Green Tea, and while it does have a little caffeine, it also has L-Theanine in it which is a natural relaxant. So I stuck with the Matcha and a month later....

Ok, I know this is going to sound stupid, but I really do feel like I had some sort of revelation. Since I've been off the coffee and energy drinks, my anxiety has melted away. I was still getting a little bump of unease with the Matcha later in the morning, but that has melted away as well. I figure I'm only getting maybe 30-40mgs of caffeine from the one serving of Matcha in the morning. And that's it. The rest of the day I drink water or some other type of electrolyte drink without caffeine. I can't believe it took me this long to do this. I feel like a complete idiot! All this time, suffering day to day with this dread. And all it took was quitting this drug I've been addicted to my entire adult life.

Look, I'm not saying I'm ""cured"" of anxiety. I'm still having my moments from time to time. But it is without a doubt, 1000% better than it was before. Considering what I've been through this year, I've never felt better from a mental standpoint. I'm sure this has been said on this sub reddit a million times before but IF YOU ARE A CAFFEINE SENSITIVE PERSON AND HAVE ANXIETY.... STOP THE CAFFEINE!!!! I can't stress this enough. It has changed my life and I have no intention of ever going back. It changed everything. Including enabling me to sleep soundly through the night for the first time in my adult memory. Which in itself will also help your anxiety. Not to mention my blood pressure has also dropped. There are so many benefits to quitting.

Caffeine is a vicious cycle. It IS a drug, and it WILL consume you. It will disrupt your life, make your sleep bad, make you crave it day and night. And maybe that's fine for the type A peeps who don't suffer from this condition and can handle higher amounts of it. But for the ones of us suffering day in and day out with our anxiety? Please, do yourself a favor and ditch the caffeine. Or do what I do, which is treat yourself to a \*tiny\* amount of it in the morning and that's it. It might change your life.",3,1753391898.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1m8gm05,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1m8gm05/why_cant_i_move_on_from_her/,why can’t i move on from her?,"I (F20) met her — let’s call her princess (she’s named after a princess)— when I was around 17, through my younger cousin. She’s three years younger than me. I know that sounds bad, and I don’t want to be judged for it — nothing ever happened, and I never did or said anything to make her uncomfortable. But the truth is, from the first moment I saw her, I knew I was in too deep.

I was with my cousin and my best friend the day we met her. It was all casual and friendly, but as soon as princess left, I looked at my best friend, and she looked right back at me — like we both knew. I remember saying, “She’s so pretty,” and my best friend just knew. I didn’t even know princess was younger than me at first. I found out later. We took the same bus to school, so I’d see her often. And every time I did, I’d try to start a conversation, even if it was awkward. I wasn’t trying to flirt or get anything — I just wanted to be around her, to know her.

One day I was supposed to meet my cousin at the bus stop. When I called her, she said she was with princess. I joined them, starving after the gym, and asked my cousin to come with me to grab something to eat. She said she was too lazy. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw princess fidgeting with her backpack — then she pulled out a pack of cookies and gave them to me. I told her she didn’t have to, that I’d be fine, but she insisted until I opened the pack.

We got on the bus, and I asked my cousin to let me sit next to princess. We talked and laughed the whole ride. After that, it became a little routine. Waiting for the bus, sitting together, little conversations that meant more to me than she probably realized. Little moments that felt like everything. Eventually, I asked my cousin for her Instagram. I followed her, and to my surprise, she followed me back. I’m not someone people usually notice — I’m chubby, awkward, and back then, I had already quit the gym again — but she followed me back.

A few days later, she responded to one of my stories, and we started talking. Not just casual, surface-level talk — deep conversations. Vulnerable ones. We got to know each other really fast. What was only two weeks felt like two years. I knew she was straight. And I knew she was younger. I never expected anything romantic. I just… wanted to be close to her. But my crush grew every day.

Then she ghosted me.

For three months.

Not just online — in real life too. When I tried to say hi, she’d barely look at me. Sometimes she’d say a cold, frustrated “hi,” but that was it. I was invisible. Then, out of nowhere, she started talking to me again — like nothing had ever happened. I asked her why, and she said, “I needed time for myself. You’re not the only one I ghosted.” But I knew I was. She talked to everyone else during that time. Just not me. But I let it go — partly because I still liked her, but also because I genuinely liked being her friend. She was sweet, and funny, and smart. We had things in common that not even I shared with my best friend.

Summer came and went. We texted a bit. Then she ghosted me again.

By September, I told myself I’d start detaching. I knew I was needy and jealous, and I wanted to pull back for my own good. But the second I started doing that — she got clingier. More attached. she’d hug me — but not just quick, casual hugs. I mean tight hugs. Long hugs. She would cling to me like she needed it. Like I was some kind of anchor. She started being more and more attached to me — always close, always leaning into me, leaning her head on my shoulder, always wanting to touch me. And I started to feel less crazy about how I felt. Every time we saw princess, my best friend would give me that look — you know the one. And afterward, I’d get texts like: “She smiled like you were the only person in the world.” “She didn’t take her eyes off you.” “She hugged you like she never wanted to let go.” “She looked terrified when you said you didn’t take your meds.”

Then i started to think she felt something for me too. My best friend saw it too.

Over the next year, our bond deepened. The ghosting continued sometimes, but it became clear that princess knew I liked her. We never talked about it. There was nothing to talk about — it was just my one-sided feelings. But I did little things that kinda confirmed my feelings. For months, I gave her my headphones on the bus so she could escape into music. Even though I’m extremely anxious and can’t stand loud and crowded places, I let her listen. It made her calm. That was enough.

Then, in February last year, my dad died.

We hadn’t really talked in a while, but the moment she found out, she texted me — a full paragraph. I was out of school for a month afterward, and during that time, she kept texting me. Every single day. It was normal conversation, but for us, it wasn’t. When I finally returned to school, she saved me a seat next to her on the bus. I was grieving. I felt awful — sick, numb, not eating, barely sleeping. That morning, she kept talking to me the entire ride, checking in, trying to keep my focus on her. Later that day, we went bowling with a group — her, me, my cousin, a mutual friend, and my best friend. I didn’t feel like playing, but I didn’t want to be alone either. She noticed. Of course she did. She sat next to me. We started talking — really talking — about how we met, our first impressions, and more. She was gentle. Kind. That moment mattered to me.

After that, we got a little closer. We hung out a few more times, just the two of us once. And she started becoming… protective. More physically affectionate. My best friend noticed too — the way princess would look at me, touch me, get mad and protective over me when i was sick or wouldn’t take my pills. There was this one time at the mall — we were with our usual group, and I was on the verge of a breakdown, arguing with my best friend. Princess stopped me in the middle of the sidewalk, told “hey, calm down please” hugged me tight, and then — KISSED me on the cheek.

That was the first and only kiss she ever gave me. And yeah, maybe I’m an awkward, emotionally constipated masc, but friends don’t do that, right?

My best friend texted me after we split ways, saying things like, “You two look really good together.” She’d taken pictures of us too. One of Princess holding my hand while I was terrified on the escalator (I’m scared of heights), and one of me watching her at the arcade. We did look good together.

Then summer came. We didn’t talk much, but we were okay. When September rolled around again, she got a new boyfriend. She talked about him more, spent more time with him. I didn’t mind. I always knew she was straight. I was genuinely happy for her. But something shifted. Even her best friend told me she didn’t like the guy, or how princess acted around him.

Still, we saw each other sometimes — grabbed coffee, joked around like usual. On New Year’s Eve, I stayed home. I used to always spend it with my dad, so this year hurt. Princess texted me, asked what I was doing. I told her I was home alone, and she said I could talk to her if I wanted. Then she asked if I wanted to FaceTime. It was only our second time calling — the first was when we both had pneumonia at the same time, ironically. We talked for about an hour, and it was sweet and light. At midnight, the call dropped because of signal, but right after, she called back. With the brightest smile and the softest voice, she said: “Happy New Year.”

We texted a little after that, but then we both started pulling away again. More and more distant. And by the time summer break came around, I barely saw her at all.

I’ve done my best to detach. My feelings for her aren’t what they used to be. But no matter how far I pull away, she still has this soft spot in my heart that I just can’t get rid of. I dream about her sometimes — not in weird ways, just in quiet ones. We’re together. We’re cuddling. That she holds me like I wanted her to. We’re kissing. Things that never happened. Things that probably never will.

And even now, I miss her. I miss talking to her. I miss texting her. I miss being with her, in whatever way I could. When I see other people with their lovers, sitting close, holding eachother — I think of her. I think of what it would be like if it were us.

And I know it sounds messed up, especially because she’s younger. But I swear — I NEVER crossed a line, NEVER made her feel unsafe, or did anything inappropriate. I just… cared too much. Maybe still do. Maybe I’m still holding on to the hope of something that was never mine. But she is princess. And I don’t think I’ll ever really forget her.

And I don’t know… maybe I’m crazy. Maybe it was all in my head. And that’s why I can’t move on.

Or maybe it wasn’t just in my head. Maybe there really was something between us — and that’s why I can’t let go.",2,1753391863.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

She was concerned that the delivery person would leave it in front of the door; she thought someone might nab it. She got a bit upset with me for ordering it before we got to our place. I remember getting out of our cab, walking up to the door, seeing it there, and feeling so relieved. ""See!"" We used it a few times but quickly realized it was really inconvenient and bulky.

Coloring books and other activity books her colleague got for when she was hospitalized.

Her laundry basket (she wanted to get new ones anyway).

Window privacy decal, in a design she really liked, that only she knew how to put up. She didn't get a chance to do it.

A small rug I'd owned for ten or eleven years that was starting to fall apart.

A few of my clothes, including a shirt of mine that she liked but that never quite fit right.

I had to pull one of her coffee mugs out of the donate bin at the last minute. The funny thing about that is I was always encouraging her to get rid of it when she was alive; now I'll keep it (at least for a bit longer).

I typed all that out just to prove to myself that it's all stuff worth getting rid of.

The only thing I'm slightly sad to see go is that damn wagon. We got it at a time we were feeling particularly hopeful / optimistic. Now it's gone.",5,1753391836.0,widowers,2,1.0,False
1m8glay,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1m8glay/i_have_a_date_tomorrow/,I have a date tomorrow,"I’ve been on these dating apps lately, looking for distractions, confidence or maybe out of boredom.. I hit X or swipe left over the littlest things… we can all be picky over a just a picture and our imagination.

I was texting with one but then after hearing him speak on the phone I told him I can’t speak to him anymore.   Why? Well, I guess I was triggered… 

I don’t know the stages of healing, I will look it up after this but I don’t like this stage… maybe this is the stage you used to pull me back in, when I was so weak, tired and confused.  You, after all are the “devil I know,” and it’s the devil I don’t that scares me the most. 

I do know that in this discovery phase of mine I have little tolerance.. Anyone who has anything similar to you is automatically eliminated… muscles, mannerisms, likes/hates, comments, music, motorcycles, trucks, tank tops, blue collar… ha, even your common name.. left, left, left, left, X, X, X, X.. doesn’t leave a big pool of options. 

What do you call that? I don’t know, but tomorrow I have a date with a man that has nothing, NOTHING similar to you so it makes me very, very nervous. 

He is confident but not arrogant.  He loves his family, he is calm, seems to be honest so far, ambitious and he laughs at my jokes.  He claims he’s a gentleman, the kind you see on TV in old movies..  He laughs at a lot of what I say and he randomly texts me, he makes me feel intelligent and unique. I think he is too. We all are in someway right?  He compliments me and is genuinely interested in me.  He has kids he fought for. 

I have another date too, less appealing but sexy.  There is something that gets me anxious about him, maybe because he’s too close in proximity or maybe because he’s too into me.. like you were. I may tell him I cannot chat anymore too, if someone gives me anxiety I should cancel right? You did and I didn’t cancel you but I guess everyone gives me anxiety.. cancel them all? No, I need to know I don’t owe them anything. 

I don’t know what to do with myself, I have too much time to read, study, write, watch TV and scroll but not enough ambition to find a recreation.  Baby steps… I met a friend for coffee today, a mutual engagement; it was easy, I picked the day and time and she picks the place… baby steps.. social baby steps. The days are long, years are short. I’m taking time for granted. 

I need to find a recreation.  Never being allowed to live for myself has me codependent on anything but myself. I still feel the need to fix things, fix, fix, fix.. it’s exhausting but I’m aware of it now and I don’t want to fix anymore, I want to live. I want to live in peace and not chaos to clean up. Boredom is ok. 

So tomorrow I will go on my fancy date and wear my fancy dress and I will listen to the gentleman across the table and let him buy my dinner, walk me to my car and drive home in anticipation of what’s next because he is nothing like you and there is something exciting about that.

1m8gjth,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbiangang/comments/1m8gjth/why_cant_i_get_over_her/,why can’t i get over her?,"
I (F20) met her — let’s call her princess (she’s named after a princess)— when I was around 17, through my younger cousin. She’s three years younger than me. I know that sounds bad, and I don’t want to be judged for it — nothing ever happened, and I never did or said anything to make her uncomfortable. But the truth is, from the first moment I saw her, I knew I was in too deep.

I was with my cousin and my best friend the day we met her. It was all casual and friendly, but as soon as princess left, I looked at my best friend, and she looked right back at me — like we both knew. I remember saying, “She’s so pretty,” and my best friend just knew. I didn’t even know princess was younger than me at first. I found out later. We took the same bus to school, so I’d see her often. And every time I did, I’d try to start a conversation, even if it was awkward. I wasn’t trying to flirt or get anything — I just wanted to be around her, to know her.

One day I was supposed to meet my cousin at the bus stop. When I called her, she said she was with princess. I joined them, starving after the gym, and asked my cousin to come with me to grab something to eat. She said she was too lazy. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw princess fidgeting with her backpack — then she pulled out a pack of cookies and gave them to me. I told her she didn’t have to, that I’d be fine, but she insisted until I opened the pack.

We got on the bus, and I asked my cousin to let me sit next to princess. We talked and laughed the whole ride. After that, it became a little routine. Waiting for the bus, sitting together, little conversations that meant more to me than she probably realized. Little moments that felt like everything. Eventually, I asked my cousin for her Instagram. I followed her, and to my surprise, she followed me back. I’m not someone people usually notice — I’m chubby, awkward, and back then, I had already quit the gym again — but she followed me back.

A few days later, she responded to one of my stories, and we started talking. Not just casual, surface-level talk — deep conversations. Vulnerable ones. We got to know each other really fast. What was only two weeks felt like two years. I knew she was straight. And I knew she was younger. I never expected anything romantic. I just… wanted to be close to her. But my crush grew every day.

Then she ghosted me.

For three months.

Not just online — in real life too. When I tried to say hi, she’d barely look at me. Sometimes she’d say a cold, frustrated “hi,” but that was it. I was invisible. Then, out of nowhere, she started talking to me again — like nothing had ever happened. I asked her why, and she said, “I needed time for myself. You’re not the only one I ghosted.” But I knew I was. She talked to everyone else during that time. Just not me. But I let it go — partly because I still liked her, but also because I genuinely liked being her friend. She was sweet, and funny, and smart. We had things in common that not even I shared with my best friend.

Summer came and went. We texted a bit. Then she ghosted me again.

By September, I told myself I’d start detaching. I knew I was needy and jealous, and I wanted to pull back for my own good. But the second I started doing that — she got clingier. More attached. she’d hug me — but not just quick, casual hugs. I mean tight hugs. Long hugs. She would cling to me like she needed it. Like I was some kind of anchor. She started being more and more attached to me — always close, always leaning into me, leaning her head on my shoulder, always wanting to touch me. And I started to feel less crazy about how I felt. Every time we saw princess, my best friend would give me that look — you know the one. And afterward, I’d get texts like:
“She smiled like you were the only person in the world.”
“She didn’t take her eyes off you.”
“She hugged you like she never wanted to let go.”
“She looked terrified when you said you didn’t take your meds.”

Then i started to think she felt something for me too. My best friend saw it too.

Over the next year, our bond deepened. The ghosting continued sometimes, but it became clear that princess knew I liked her. We never talked about it. There was nothing to talk about — it was just my one-sided feelings. But I did little things that kinda confirmed my feelings. For months, I gave her my headphones on the bus so she could escape into music. Even though I’m extremely anxious and can’t stand loud and crowded places, I let her listen. It made her calm. That was enough.

Then, in February last year, my dad died.

We hadn’t really talked in a while, but the moment she found out, she texted me — a full paragraph. I was out of school for a month afterward, and during that time, she kept texting me. Every single day. It was normal conversation, but for us, it wasn’t. When I finally returned to school, she saved me a seat next to her on the bus. I was grieving. I felt awful — sick, numb, not eating, barely sleeping. That morning, she kept talking to me the entire ride, checking in, trying to keep my focus on her. Later that day, we went bowling with a group — her, me, my cousin, a mutual friend, and my best friend. I didn’t feel like playing, but I didn’t want to be alone either. She noticed. Of course she did. She sat next to me. We started talking — really talking — about how we met, our first impressions, and more. She was gentle. Kind. That moment mattered to me.

After that, we got a little closer. We hung out a few more times, just the two of us once. And she started becoming… protective. More physically affectionate. My best friend noticed too — the way princess would look at me, touch me, get mad and protective over me when i was sick or wouldn’t take my pills. There was this one time at the mall — we were with our usual group, and I was on the verge of a breakdown, arguing with my best friend. Princess stopped me in the middle of the sidewalk, told “hey, calm down please” hugged me tight, and then — KISSED me on the cheek.

That was the first and only kiss she ever gave me. And yeah, maybe I’m an awkward, emotionally constipated masc, but friends don’t do that, right?

My best friend texted me after we split ways, saying things like, “You two look really good together.” She’d taken pictures of us too. One of Princess holding my hand while I was terrified on the escalator (I’m scared of heights), and one of me watching her at the arcade. We did look good together.

Then summer came. We didn’t talk much, but we were okay. When September rolled around again, she got a new boyfriend. She talked about him more, spent more time with him. I didn’t mind. I always knew she was straight. I was genuinely happy for her. But something shifted. Even her best friend told me she didn’t like the guy, or how princess acted around him.

Still, we saw each other sometimes — grabbed coffee, joked around like usual. On New Year’s Eve, I stayed home. I used to always spend it with my dad, so this year hurt. Princess texted me, asked what I was doing. I told her I was home alone, and she said I could talk to her if I wanted. Then she asked if I wanted to FaceTime. It was only our second time calling — the first was when we both had pneumonia at the same time, ironically. We talked for about an hour, and it was sweet and light. At midnight, the call dropped because of signal, but right after, she called back. With the brightest smile and the softest voice, she said: “Happy New Year.”

We texted a little after that, but then we both started pulling away again. More and more distant. And by the time summer break came around, I barely saw her at all.

I’ve done my best to detach. My feelings for her aren’t what they used to be. But no matter how far I pull away, she still has this soft spot in my heart that I just can’t get rid of. I dream about her sometimes — not in weird ways, just in quiet ones. We’re together. We’re cuddling. That she holds me like I wanted her to. We’re kissing. Things that never happened. Things that probably never will.

And even now, I miss her. I miss talking to her. I miss texting her. I miss being with her, in whatever way I could. When I see other people with their lovers, sitting close, holding eachother — I think of her. I think of what it would be like if it were us. 

And I know it sounds messed up, especially because she’s younger. But I swear — I NEVER crossed a line, NEVER made her feel unsafe, or did anything inappropriate. I just… cared too much. Maybe still do. Maybe I’m still holding on to the hope of something that was never mine. But she is princess. And I don’t think I’ll ever really forget her.

And I don’t know… maybe I’m crazy. Maybe it was all in my head. And that’s why I can’t move on.

Or maybe it wasn’t just in my head. Maybe there really was something between us — and that’s why I can’t let go.

I started having pain months ago after a tooth was shaved down for a crown and out of the many xrays, scans and even cone beam, they said there is no crack or infection.  Amoxicillin, steroids, and magnesium all work to help pain.  Once I go off of them, the pain returns.  It feels mostly pinpointed to the root canal tooth and sometimes into bottom jaw and teeth and feels sensitive to coffee, tea, some juices and an energy drink (I don't drink them but it was hell) which I tried because I wanted to see had me howling in throbbing sensitive pain.  It was explained to me that they believe a nerve connecting eye and similar areas as well as to the tooth has been sensitized.  I was prescribed pamelor and told to take it for 4 to 6 months to try to desensitize the nerve and then go from there.

My questions are:

1.  Has anyone had success in better pain after coming off pamelor?  Also, did you gain a ton of weight or have bad other side effects? If for some reason it was my tooth that was the problem...pamelor probably wouldn't work right?

2.  Did you ever go into remission from giving the nerve time?

3.  I would like to hear stories.  Part of me still believes the tooth is cracked  under my gums and they just can't see it but no matter how many times I hear it, over and over that it's not, my anxiety gets to me. 

I was going to have the tooth taken out anyways and the pain specialist says I can if I would like but that they wouldn't personally.  I was put back in a temporary and am terrified to have a permanent put back on :(",2,1753391471.0,TrigeminalNeuralgia,2,1.0,False

I’m a guy from Sicily with a deep passion for progressive rock.

After attending the Dream Theater concert in Taormina a few weeks ago — and with Steve Hackett tickets ready for September — I found myself once again doing what I always do:  
digging across a dozen different websites, trying to figure out which prog shows were happening, and where.  
Every time, I ended up copy-pasting stuff into an Excel sheet… which always turned into chaos.

So I asked myself:

*“What if I could automate this? What if I could build something that just shows prog concerts — and nothing else?”*

That’s how **ProgDealer** was born.

It’s a simple site I built with a lot of love, and it’s my first proper web app project. The idea is to create a **clean, curated database of prog rock, prog metal, and alternative rock concerts and festivals across Europe.**

Every two weeks, the site scans sources like **Bandsintown** and **Concertful**, and automatically adds new events.  
These are filtered and classified using AI — so you only see events that are truly relevant to the progressive scene.

But my real hope is that it won’t just be automated:  
That it becomes something **community-powered**, where people can **sign up (even with Google)** and help by reporting new concerts, sharing tips, and shaping the platform together.

Right now you can:

* Browse upcoming events
* Filter by genre, city, or band
* Sign up and submit new concerts manually

Of course, I know there’s still a lot to fix and improve. I'm already working on:

* Improving the mobile layout
* Making filters more intuitive
* Fine-tuning the automatic imports

But beyond that, what I really need is **feedback** — on anything. What’s missing? What would make it better? What would *you* love to see in a platform like this?  
I'll soon add a **public roadmap** where I’ll list upcoming features and personally thank every user whose suggestions I end up implementing.

There are no ads, no distractions — just a small, community-driven project made by a prog fan, for other prog fans.  
There’s just a Buy Me a Coffee page if anyone ever feels like supporting this little effort

Wait, What?","Every once in a while I come across an item that changes my perspective about an entire class of products. Smart washer/dryers were worthless, until I got one and now I can't live without it. Folding phones. WiFi 7 routers. Today I'm officially adding the Asus ROG Flow Z13 to that list, and by extension, integrated graphics cards. The gaming performance on display here is such that I can actually see a future where discrete graphics cards are obsolete. As someone who avoids iGPUs like the plague, this is a shocking turn of events. I wasn't expecting much, but what I experienced has changed the way I'll be playing PC games forever...

Disclaimer: This unit was loaned to me for review as part of the Asus For the Loyal Elite Program and will be returned upon the conclusion of the review period. My opinions are my own. As an aside, I would encourage everyone to check out the Asus Elite Rewards Program where you have the opportunity to earn points weekly to accumulate for gear, gift cards, games, etc. It's a pretty neat program [https://rog.asus.com/us/elite/activity/all](https://rog.asus.com/us/elite/activity/all)

**Unboxing / Hardware Overview**

I'll say one thing for Asus, they've really learned to nail down the unboxing experience. A nice, silver outer package gives way to 2 main boxes, one for the machine itself and one for the 200W power brick. Everything is neatly packed and wrapped in a glossy wrapper. The presentation here is outstanding. 

The first thing you immediately notice about this tablet/laptop is how robust it is. It weighs every bit the 2.6 lbs it's listed at, and this is shocking regardless of your perspective. If you go into it expecting a tablet, then WOW, this is heavy. If you go in expecting a laptop, then WOW, this is really light. Either way, the fully aluminum chassis is pretty breathtaking. There's an RGB-laden window on the rear of the device to give it that lighting flare we gamers crave

There's a full-length kickstand at the bottom of the device with a neat, flush tab for easy extension, and it sits on some of the most robust hinges I've ever seen. Under the kickstand is the accessible port for the M2 drive, making swapping it out a simple matter with no full disassembly required.

I thought I would hate the included keyboard when I first saw it because it looked thin and uninspired. Then I tried it and I'm 100% sold on it. It's a chiclet style keyboard with a magnetic pogo connector and the entire thing folds up neatly over the screen. There's even RGB backlighting, which is great for use in darker environments. All I'll say about the keyboard is don't knock it until you've tried it. I found typing on it to be pretty excellent and it's just about perfect for gaming (VERY short-throw keys...).

As for I/O you have a pretty complete suite here. There's a 3.5mm combo audio jack, a full size HDMI 2.1 port, a 10gb USB 3.2 port and dual USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports which both support Displayport and power delivery (huge). There's also a microSD card reader slot and the proprietary Asus charging port they started using in 2025 for the 200W power charging. Finally, there's a dedicated button which is used to call up the Armoury Crate software or indeed anything else you'd like to configure it to do. It's a neat touch, as is the recessed power button which I did not once ever hit inadvertently.

There are dual cameras here, a 13mp rear camera and a 5mp IR front camera which indeed supports Windows Hello. I found logging in via the camera definitely a hit or miss affair, but that has little to do with the camera itself and more to do with how Microsoft implements it (I have issues with my desktop machine occasionally as well). The rear camera is interesting. I didn't think I'd ever use it until I was sitting outside one day and my dog was doing something utterly stupid. No phone in sight, so it was the Flow Z13 to the rescue. Pretty handy...

On the audio side there are 4 speakers present, and I'm VERY happy to report that Asus keeps their tradition of supporting Dolby Atmos here, complete with the full license. Sound quality from these \*small\* speakers is surprisingly good. Definitely passable for gaming and they get plenty loud, but don't expect audiophile quality here, they're just not big enough. The audio jack also supports Hi-Res audio, which is GREAT to see. I'll also mention that this laptop has a 3 microphone array with noise cancelling, and in-game it worked surprisingly well. 

There's WiFi 7 onboard, which for me is pretty neat as I happen to have a WiFi 7 setup. Speeds are...insane. Being able to download games at a 1.9Gbps clip tends to spoil you pretty quickly... *PROTIP: don't waste 45 minutes trying to figure out why you can't connect to your WiFi 7 network until/unless you've installed Windows update 24H2, which apparently enables WiFi 7 support :/*

There's a 13.4 inch 2.5K display here, which Asus insists is a Nebula display. Now, I have an Asus Nebula display on my gaming laptop (Scar 18). It's mini-led and I'm on record as saying it's every bit as good as, if not superior to, OLED and is one of the most breathtaking displays I've ever seen. The display here is...not that one. It's very nice, has a 180hz refresh rate and is a touch screen, but it's neither mini-led nor OLED. It's what they call an ""IPS-level"" display. What this means is that you will see some mild backlight bleed, you will have only a handful of dimming zones and the brightness peaks at 500 nits. To be very clear, this display is absolutely superior to every other laptop display I've tried outside of a few, but when Asus throws around the ""Nebula"" brand I admit I am spoiled and was a bit disappointed here because I know what a true ""Nebula"" display is capable of

Further, the display does indeed support Dolby Vision (and HDR in general)...**but only for video.** It's a really odd thing. Movies and streaming content display DV/HDR (depending on source) just fine, but HDR/DV is completely invisible to all games. I've researched this extensively and it's a design choice on the part of Asus, not a driver or firmware issue. 

Ok finally let's talk about the chipset and cooling. The special sauce here is the AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395. It's a ridiculous name (bad) with ridiculous performance (great). More on this in a bit.

There's a unified memory architecture here, with the memory allocated to the GPU adjustable within settings depending on your overall RAM configuration. My unit had 32GB total memory, and after playing around with dedicating 8GB and 16GB to the GPU I settled on 8GB. You can, however, buy this device with 64GB and even 128GB of unified memory and tweak the GPU allocation accordingly.

The cooling is handled by the ""usual"" suite of Asus performance hardware. Vapor chamber? Check. Thermal Grizzly liquid metal paste? Check. Amazing throughput from the cooling fans with dust filters? Also check. They have a formula for success here, and Asus have executed it to perfection once again. The exhaust fans are at the top of the display, which is a pretty great solution for this form factor as it spews the heat completely away from you and whatever surface you're perched on. If you want to have this on your lap (awkward but definitely possible) you don't have to worry about heat cooking your legs whatsoever.

**Gaming Performance**

This is the reason we're all here, and I am thrilled to report that the Flow Z13's gaming performance absolutely shocked me. At a minimum it's on par with an RTX 4060 laptop GPU. In some games it actually outperformed an RTX 4070 laptop. In Manual mode (everything maxed) at default 2560x1600 resolution with all settings maxed and FSR 3 Quality enabled (where available) I was getting minimally 60fps on all of the games I typically play and in most cases far higher. No RT, no frame gen, just pure fps glory. Halo Infinite, Black Ops 6, Forza Motorsport, The Last of Us Part I, God of War, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077. Turn on frame generation and/or switch to FSR balanced and get 100fps in games like Cyberpunk on max settings? Yes please...On and on, game after game the performance floored me. And again, I cannot stress this enough, these were all at max graphical settings and 1600p. If you're willing to compromise and lower the settings, resolution and/or switch the power profile to something like Performance or Silent, you can absolutely 100% game completely on battery here and it will be the best battery gaming experience you've ever had. For an iGPU to hit nearly 11k in Time Spy is just wild to me

Now these results are obviously going to vary with different games and in different environments. I personally tried to test this laptop in extreme settings (outdoors in 90 degree heat) and achieved the above consistently. The thing is, at no time did I ever experience thermal throttling in these admittedly ridiculous conditions. Fans were loud-ish, sure, but no throttling. When cooler heads prevailed (literally) and I was inside in a 67 degree air conditioned room, performance was the same level of insanity but the fans didn't need to work nearly as hard. 

**Battery Life and Fan Noise**

I'm not one to game while on battery, but the portability here just screams to do just that. The newly overhauled Armoury Crate software (new and improved, seriously) is onboard of course, and you tweak the power profile here based on what you're looking for out of the device for each session. The default for battery mode for the 70wh battery is Silent, which for regular everyday use + video watching gave me between 6 and 8 hours of screen time. Again, it's the duality of this product at play. As far as a laptop goes, 6-8 hours of battery is fantastic. Compared to a tablet, 6-8 hours of battery is terrible. As far as fans go, Silent mode certainly lives up to its name as the fan noise barely went above a whisper throughout.

Gaming on battery is a different affair entirely. In silent mode (which adjusts screen brightness, power draw and fan profiles accordingly) I got about an hour and a half entirely on battery (native resolution, max settings). Cranking up to Performance mode increases the burn rate significantly (while of course increasing performance accordingly) and drops you down to about an hour, while switching to Turbo puts you at roughly 45 minutes. Just understand that when you're exclusively on battery you're obviously not going to be tapping into the full power of the iGPU so game performance is going to be throttled down accordingly.

BUT, there's a solution here thanks to the two onboard USB power delivery ports. A cheap, smallish 100W power bank lets you game in Performance, Turbo and even Manual mode (with all metrics maxed out) for 2-3 hours pretty easily with no drop in gaming performance. You'll still drain the battery of course (you need the full 200W brick to actually charge while gaming), but it's a really neat minimalist option to have when you're out and about with no outlets in sight. Fan noise cranks up accordingly, however, and there were times when I was outside on a hot day gaming at max performance and the fans were pretty loud. Not deal-breakingly loud (they're small fans after all), but still definitely noticeable. You can certainly tweak this in AC, but understand that with great power comes great responsibility. And noise. 

**Downsides**

The screen and its 180hz refresh rate kept up with everything wonderfully. It's bitterly disappointing however that HDR/Dolby Vision isn't supported in games as I've grown to become something of a snob with this aspect of gaming these days. It was still a very pleasant visual experience and the ""IPS level"" display is quite good (especially for a touch screen). Nevertheless, it's just a REALLY odd choice, Asus...

Another downside and the elephant in the room with the Flow Z13 is onboard storage. It comes with an M2 slot. This is great. It's a 2230 slot. This is terrible. The only shipping option here is a 1TB drive, which I managed to completely saturate within the first 30 minutes (onboard WiFi 7 FTW!!!). The thing is, because it's the stupid 2230 form factor, you're limited to just 2TB even if you upgrade. As someone who has 2 (TWO) 8TB 2280 drives in his Scar 18, the lack of any real storage option here is criminal and will be a serious bottleneck if you're buying this for gaming. 100GB games are pretty standard, and in the case of stuff like Black Ops 6, well, it's a SERIOUS problem. Again, the WiFi 7 mitigates this somewhat, but still...

**Conclusion**

I never thought I'd see the day when an iGPU could be a viable gaming platform, yet here we are. To say I've had a blast playing games on this machine is an understatement. The portability to performance ratio is insane and I have actually taken this laptop to places I wouldn't dream of taking my Scar 18. Barbecues, coffee shops, the DMV (yeah...). To be able to play AAA games with maxed out graphics on a 2lb device is just wild to me. To be able to take that same laptop and seamlessly bring it to the library for work/school or to put it into my gym as a touchscreen for my live training programs is beyond wild, it's a paradigm shift. One thing I didn't even mention (and won't, I'm a gamer after all) is how powerful this chipset is at productivity tasks like Davinci Resolve. It beats my desktop i13700k in 4k rendering...

AMD really hit it out of the park with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset here, and Asus added their manufacturing superiority to create the ultimate do-everything device. It's a zero-compromise ""gaming machine+"" in the perfect form factor

One of the things I could understand potential buyers struggling with when considering the Flow Z13 is the use case. If you want a tablet you'd probably buy a dedicated tablet. If you want a gaming handheld you'd probably buy that. If you want a gaming laptop or a work laptop you'd buy those. I was like these people and I never even considered the Flow Z13 before this review. After using it as my everyday device for the past 3 weeks, however, I can't imagine anyone considering anything else. It's basically perfection as the ultimate truly portable PC gaming system that happens to be a tablet. Just, Asus, please, for the next iteration ditch the 2230. My phone has just as much storage, but I'm not running Black Ops 6 or Forza on it...

The promise of freshly ground coffee paired with single-serve convenience is tough to ignore. Testing this grind-and-brew coffee machine over the past weeks has solidified my feelings about its strengths and a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Style and Design**

This machine is beautifully compact and sleek, making it the centerpiece of my kitchen counter without taking up unnecessary space. Its black matte finish gives it a premium touch, and the well-labeled buttons simplify operation—even for guests unfamiliar with my coffee-loving ways. Despite its modest size (11.02""D x 7.28""W x 12.67""H), it integrates a conical burr grinder, a feature typically reserved for larger machines. The removable 48-ounce water reservoir is incredibly easy to fill, and the water window ensures I never accidentally underfill or overfill.

**Functionality at Its Core**

I’ve rarely seen a coffee maker so versatile. The single-serve brewer allows three brewing sizes: 8, 10, and 12 ounces, accommodating my changing caffeine needs throughout the day. It’s also compatible with both ground coffee and single-use coffee pods, thanks to Cuisinart’s HomeBarista reusable filter cup. Testing various pods and my own blends, the grinder surprised me with its consistency, evenly grinding whole beans into the reusable cup without clogging or spillage. A built-in hopper holds and seals up to 100 grams of beans, which keeps them fresh for constant use.

**Highlights**

- The integrated conical burr grinder delivers consistently ground beans for optimal flavor.
- Single-serve ease with serving sizes up to 12 ounces and compatibility with Keurig K-Cup pods.  
- Removable water tank and drip tray make cleaning refreshingly simple.  
- The HomeBarista reusable filter actively cuts down on waste from single-use pods.

**Performance and Taste**

Each brew produced a surprisingly flavorful cup every single time. I didn’t expect the grinder to rival my more expensive standalone unit, but it delivered a remarkably rich taste while allowing small adjustments to my grind size. Using pre-ground coffee also worked reliably, especially during mornings where I couldn't grind fresh beans. The consistent water temperature enhanced extraction, resulting in balanced coffees for every cup size. Even with an optional reusable filter cup, it worked seamlessly with popular coffee pods, satisfying the non-bean-grinders in my family.

**Areas of Concern**

No product is perfect, and I did encounter some limitations while using this coffee maker. For instance, the grinder can get loud, which might wake everyone up if you’re prepping coffee at 6 a.m. Additionally, cleaning the grinder and chute requires extra care. Some coffee grounds can stubbornly stick in hidden spots, making post-brew maintenance a little more time-consuming. Also, while the removable reservoir and drip tray add to ease, they leave room for accidental spills during handling.

- The grinder noise level could be disruptive in quieter environments.
- Cleaning maintenance, especially for the grinder, is slightly cumbersome.  
- Limited programmability compared to high-end coffee makers.

**Peer Products**

In terms of competitors, this coffee maker fares well for its price and features. Machines like the Keurig K-Elite or Breville Bambino are solid rivals. While the K-Elite boasts a larger reservoir and is quieter during operation, it lacks the grinder functionality that adds depth to the Cuisinart. On the other hand, Breville offers a more robust espresso experience but comes with a steeper learning curve and price tag. The standout feature of the Cuisinart DGB-2 remains its grind-and-brew mechanism that simplifies premium coffee-making in one device, saving counter space and time.

**Bang for the Buck**

In terms of price performance, this coffee maker hits a sweet spot. You’re essentially getting a multi-function grinder and brewer combo for much less than purchasing these units separately. It’s hearty enough for serious coffee drinkers but still accessible for newcomers dabbling in grinding fresh beans. Though not entirely free from minor mechanical challenges, the machine’s ability to deliver café-quality results with such convenience justifies its cost. You’d have to spend significantly more for a similar grind-and-brew experience elsewhere.

This was my first time completely planning a trip entirely by myself. I have some thoughts on the solo travel aspect that I will post to r/solotravel but until then, here are my thoughts, impressions, and recommendations on Budapest. 

#Full Itinerary

Since itineraries are a contentious thing on this sub, here is mine

Vienna: 7 nights
Budapest: 6 nights

Most of my previous travel experience involved spending extensive periods (one month or more) in a single place so I knew that I would want to travel slower and spend more time in each place. I certainly could have added Prague or Bratislava, as theyre close and thats pretty typical, and I did have free time I could have cut, but I am happy with what I did.

#Overall Impression of Budapest

I absolutely adored Budapest. The food, the people, the nightlife, the parks, the architecture, I was consistently impressed. Online I have seen mixed reviews for Budapest, especially people saying there wasn't too much to do, or that the city was ugly, or the people mean. I did not get this impression at all. I love that the city is situated right on the Danube, and walks along or across the river were a favorite activity. I spent a total of six nights there, and I do feel that was sufficient. I saw everything I wanted to see.

#Accomodations

I stayed in a small place called *Loft Hostel*, on the Pest side. The staff was amazing, they were helpful with figuring out the city and they kept things very clean. They're located on the Pest side, near the Central Market. I found this to be a great location for getting to various sights and neighborhoods. Lots of the big hotels seem to also be in/near downtown on the Pest side.

#Getting There, and Getting Around

Budapest has a number of train stations so take note when booking. I took a train from Vienna to Budapest-Keleti, which took just over two hours. Comfortable and easy ride. 

In the City they have decent public transport with passes available, but I found that I did a lot of walking. The city isn't too big, and the walks were enjoyable. I avoided taxis because I heard bad stories of tourists being ripped off. 

#Things To Do

Here is an incomplete list of things I did, and my thoughts on them

**Thermal Baths:** The Budapest Bathhouses are famous, and you absolutely must visit one while there. Széchenyi is the most famous, but they were doing renovations while I was there so I chose to go to Gellert, which is arguably the second most famous. Gellert is on the Buda side, but was just a quick walk over the Danube. Its cheaper on weekdays, so thats when I went. It definitely was mostly tourists but I didn't feel like it was too ridiculous. Myself and a few others from the hostel spent about four hours there. They serve cocktails and food upstairs. You need to bring flip flops and a towel, or rent from the bath. 

**Hungarian National Gallery:** Located in the Buda Castle (which is a must visit attraction), I found this to be a VERY impressive art museum. They had some extra exhibitions that I chose to forgo. I spent about half a day in there, and then afterwards I wandered around the castle district. Nearby is the president's official residence, and there is a changing of the guard every hour on the hour  which is worth seeing if youre nearby. 

**House of Music:** Located in the City Park, this is one of the best museums I have ever been to. You are provided a cell phone (that acts as a tracker) and some quality headphones before entering the museum. Then, depending on which display you are looking at or where you are standing, you will hear different pieces of music, along with narration. The museum aims to track the entire history of music, from ancient times to the present, with particular focus on Hungarian themes and artists. I experienced some technical trouble with the audio at one point, but staff was very helpful. Genuinely a world class museum experience, I highly recommend. 

**Margaret Island:** A park located on an island in the middle of the Danube, there are lots of little attractions and places to get lost. One of the top attractions is the musical fountain which plays music with a choreographed fountain routine every hour. Please note that the routines are preset and different each hour. I unknowingly waited for the 11am show, which I later learned was the ""Childrens Music"" show. ""How Far I'll Go"" and ""Let it Go"" in Hungarian both were interesting, but I came back at noon for Liszt and Mozart and was more impressed. 

#Restaurants

**Artizan Bakery:** Okay this isnt a restaurant, but instead a very famous and often busy bakery, they had my favorite Kakaos Csiga, a Hungarian chocolate pastry. Its a well known place, but I found prices to be reasonable and service quite good. I went twice. It is located near the American embassy and I noticed a decent amount of Americans there before working hours.

**Central Cafe:** This is also quite well known, and a bit touristy and expensive. However, the interior is beautiful, and its a nice place to get some of the high quality cakes Hungary is famous for. On two separate afternoons I spent a couple hours here just reading and tasting various cakes with a cup of coffee. 

**Pipa Etterem:** A nice place for some Hungarian food. This is near the Central Market, and was recommended by my hosts. The food was quite good but be warned, if you go with a group they don't split checks. 

**Getto Gulyas:** Went here for a nice dinner. They have some awesome Goulash options, and a pretty good Hungarian wine selection. I also ordered the Bone Marrow appetizer which was lovely. It is a little pricier but well worth it.

#Bars and Nightlife

**Szimpla Kert:** After eating at Getto Gulyas, another person from the hostel and I waited about an hour to get in here, the most famous ""ruin bar"". Everyone I knew who had been to Budapest said you had to go here once but didn't seem too thrilled about it. One of my hosts said ""its a ruin bar. They're nothing special. They pop up like mushrooms."" Maybe if I hadn't gone I'd feel like I missed out, but really it was not worth my time. The bartenders were EXCEPTIONALLY rude. And the clientele was mostly British and German college students. Others may disagree, but I think this is a skip. You aren't missing much. 

**Zsir (Fővárosi Kulipintyó):** If you take one thing from this entire write up, let it be this: go to Zsir. You can get cheap Fröccs (a mix of wine with soda water, offered in various ratios) and some limited food offerings. The staff and clientele alike were very friendly, but what set this place apart was the music. From what I gather they have some form of live music every night. I went twice and it was amazing. Frankly, I likely could have gone every night and never gotten bored of it.

**Davy Byrnes Irish Pub:** I went here for their Monday Night Trivia and it was a very good time. Not a unique cultural experience or anything, but lots of fun and drinks weren't too expensive. 

#Day Trip to Esztergom

My one day trip from Budapest, this town has a ton of history. It is where the first King of Hungary was crownded, and is the seat of the Catholic Church in Hungary. The city definitely has noticeably less tourism infrastructure, and getting around with my five words of Hungarian was more difficult than in Budapest. But the Basilica is the main attraction here, and it is very worth it. You can climb to the dome on the top, which was absolutely terrifying, but worth it. 

#Conclusion

Budapest was a ton of fun. The top tourist spots *are* filled with Viking River Cruisers and Chinese Tour Groups, but not at an unbearable level, especially once you escape the main sights. Compared to Vienna, I found that the city was a little rougher around the edges (more litter, more construction, etc) but the people were much more friendly. I wish I had maybe done like a month of Duolingo in Hungarian to at least get a few extra words and phrases, even though practically everyone spoke English. ",5,1753390606.0,Europetravel,3,1.0,False

Looking Forward To Another Week Of Infecting Every Aspect Of Your Daily Lives!","Good morning, everyone! What a week we’ve got coming up. A tremendous week. The fall season is here, we’re working on huge tax cuts, and there’s a lot of optimism having to do with business in our economy. Also, we’re ending Obamacare. And I’m going to get the wall. But beyond all that, what I’m looking forward to the most is another seven days of infecting every little aspect of your daily lives.

Oh, you thought you might be able to block me out for even a moment? Good luck with that one. There will be no rest from having to think about me, or my administration, or the latest controversy I’ve thrown myself into. I am inescapable. My name, my face, my voice, my words, and those of my legions of surrogates—no matter how much you try to go about your normal life, I will find a way force myself in. MAGA!

I’m like a disease without a cure. There’s not a single thing I haven’t contaminated. News, entertainment, medicine, sports; if there’s a part of culture I haven’t ruined for you yet, just wait. This could be the week. I’ll either claw my way into your waking consciousness or just linger in the back of your mind, ready to pop out at any moment and remind you that I’m the president of the United States and will be for at least the next three years. You know that sickening feeling in the pit of your stomach—the one that’s been there since last November? Well, it’s not going away this week, I’ll tell you that.

I will poison every second of quiet reflection that you previously enjoyed. No more sitting calmly with a coffee on a park bench. No more carefree drives with the windows down and the radio up. No more tranquil moments reveling in the splendor of a sunset. Just me festering in your brain, befouling all you hold dear.

The mind is funny like that sometimes. The second you’ve freed yourself from the burden of having to ponder my ironclad stranglehold on absolutely every facet of American life, there I’ll be again, ready to resume the endless cycle of fear, regret, anger, and shame. Go ahead, try and tune me out right now.

Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump.

They never cover it in the fake media, but I do really enjoy the creeping sadness that exists every day I’m around. It’s a fantastic feeling. I get true joy knowing that somewhere out there, someone is just looking through their refrigerator, or chatting with their family, or waiting in line to buy groceries, and I suddenly weasel my way into their brain and ratchet up their stress about not only the future of this country, but also the rest of the world. It’s a different joy than how I felt as a private citizen, when only a small percentage of people were constantly nauseated by the mere mention of my name.

It’s much, much, much better.

So enjoy the precious few minutes you have each morning before remembering that I exist. Because that is all you will have before I begin my daily task of tainting everything you love, a list that, this week, may include: the World Series, Halloween, rock concerts, shopping, birthday cake, swimming pools, Christmas trees, makeup, vacations, watching movies, time capsules, family reunions, rollercoasters, end-of-year bonuses, video games, Broadway musicals, relaxing with friends, religious solitude, fine dining, a good night’s sleep, and the new iPhone, just to name a few.

I even found an interesting way to ruin Twix bars. Can you believe that? Sometimes I even surprise myself with my ability to take something you hold dear and totally defile it, so that from then on you can’t ever think about it again without thinking about me too. Oh man, I have a doozy coming up on Thursday. It’s going to be tremendous.

Have a great week!

1m8fsue,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8fsue,Bought/Adjusted a Transport Case for Travels,"So first, a little introduction: I’m a coffee enthusiast especially for pourover with V60 method. I’ve been using following set-up for a several years:

Timemore chestnut C3 grinder
Hario 02 V60 brewer (pic 3)
Hario 03 Coffee pot (pic 3)
Klarstein (local German Brand) Garcon electric gooseneck kettle (pic 4)
A random kitchen weightscale

I consider myself a noob compared to r/pourover but I am content with the taste of my brews. I haven’t been able to like any coffee outside (except some 3rd wave cafes or local roasters which is somewhat time consuming during business trips or vacations with kids) so I’ve been carrying my equipment with my luggage or bags. Of course this came with a price, I broke 2 pots and 1 ceramic brewer during travels.

Anyway, I recently decided to put together a sleek (as possible with the budget) travel case. My goal was to have a case as close as possible like the one in pic-5. First I measured my equipment, sketched them on a paper to estimate how much space that they will cover. Then I checked the cases, of course starting with the Pelican cases. They are too expensive for my budget, even the second hand ones are like 250€ here. After that, I ordered 3 different sized cases from Amazon (pic-6, pic-7) to lay out the equipment and see if they fit. 

At that point I noticed that my gooseneck and coffee pot is way too big to fit inside a decent sized case and the rest is not so small either. Then I ordered a smaller kettle from Aliexpress. It is a Fellow Stagg EKG homage with lower quality and 1/10 of its price. I tried it with a few brews and it is enough. After kettle, I ordered a timemore mini weight scale, a Graycano Brewer (smaller than Hario 02 Ceramic and kind of hyped by coffee scene) and a Hario 02 Coffee pot (smaller than my 03).

After all my new orders were delivered, I tried to lay them out to the cases. Aluminum ones were eliminated by the height (they were 15 cm). Hard plastic case had barely enough height (~17 cm) but it was still very hard for me to fit them all. So I returned all 3 cases and ordered a bigger Aluminum case by HMF. 

When the bigger case came, the space was still tight to my surprise. I barely fit all the equipment by cutting pluck n pull foam inside. The current situation is on pic-1 and pic-2. The mission accomplished but there is room to improve. First I’ll try to trim the edges of the foam surrounding some equipment to have a better aesthetic. Then I’ll try to rubber paint the foam to have a stronger structure (right now it is not integral enough to give a sleek feeling). Maybe I’ll try to find a cheap way to get a laser cut to size foam like in the pic-5 which was my goal.

Anyways, here is my case with 46x33x26 cm or 18.11 x 12.99 x 10.24 inch dimensions. I’d say its fair but not perfect (yet).  I bought all the equipment inside the case new except the grinder and the total cost of this DIY project to me was 200€ (~235$).

Next up, I plan to start brewing with Aeropress method and put a smaller and hopefully sleeker travel case for that set-up.

I DID have a diagnosis of gastritis last year by endoscopy. I was experiencing issues with my throat which ended up being LPR (from research, those two go hand in hand) and have had GERD most of my life. I also had a several month experience with costochondritis about 4 years ago.

I had a bad stomach bug in May and have experienced some level of stomach soreness since then. Sometimes milder than others, most of the time actually would have to poke it to hurt but also to the point of me not wanting my shirt to touch my skin. My soreness is under my ribs, left side and kind of extends around my side. When it hurts, it is mild ache, nothing doubling me over. I also experience some nerve related feelings which I’ve read is normal with gastritis. 

I just went on a work trip and despite trying to make healthy choices the last few weeks and noticing some improvement, I was unable to do as well on the trip and made some stupid decisions- like drinking alcohol (not excessively), had coffee, fried foods… I was bad. And now I’m hurting. 


I know the process. If I go to my doctor, I will get a referal to gastro. Whenever I FINALLY get in, they would schedule an endoscopy which could all take months. And if this is like the LPR (which took 10 months to get a diagnosis while I suffered with no help), and then a simple OTC is the fix… I’m going to just be mad lol

I’m currently prescribed 80 mg of protonix (split morning and night) and 40 mg of famotidine before bed. I had been trying to cut back (my choice but with my dr guidance) so I’m really only taking 40 mg of protonix now. Should I increase back up? And how do I get all this health anxiety to simmer down? I keep wondering if it’s my spleen, what if it’s my pancreas… what if I’m dying… I just need some reassurance please 😏",2,1753389853.0,Gastritis,4,1.0,False

1m8fjx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolTales/comments/1m8fjx6/explore_wantjoin_cup_sealing_machine_review_is_it/,Explore WantJoin Cup Sealing Machine Review Is It Worth for Bubble Tea?,"Testing products like the WantJoin Cup Sealer Machine, model number Cup Sealing Machine, brought me face-to-face with a device that claims to be a comprehensive solution for bubble tea, coffee, and juice shop owners. After several weeks of sealing cups of bubble tea in varying volumes, I’m ready to spill all the tea—pun intended—about its performance, quirks, and practical usability.

**Efficient High-Speed Sealing in Action**  
Putting the device through its paces during a simulated busy service rush was, I’ll admit, impressive. This commercial boba sealing machine boasts the capability of sealing a cup in just three seconds, reaching up to 500–600 cups per hour. In a real setup, I managed to output over 450 in a busy three-hour stretch without overheating or showing signs of strain. Switching between manual and automatic modes on its straightforward control panel made adapting it to fluctuating customer traffic ridiculously easy.  

[Time to see WantJoin Cup Sealing Machine cost on Amazon.](https://measuringworld.com/p/b0dwwvjvp9/)  

**Uncompromised Leak-Proof Precision**  
Few things are worse for a boba tea enthusiast than a leaky drink. With everything from overfilled cups to wet or uneven rims, this machine managed to create a perfect seal every time. And if something went awry during operation, the manual patch mode came to the rescue, guaranteeing repairs with minimal fuss. Its leak-proof sealing mechanism works wonders on most cup materials, and during high-volume testing, I can confidently say—zero spills.  

**Material Quality and Sturdy Build**  
Constructed with stainless steel and polypropylene components, the reliability factor of this device stood out. Despite its 51-pound build, this machine sat firmly on the countertop without unnecessary vibrations even at full-speed operation. The durable construction convinced me that this piece of equipment is likely to withstand long-term wear and tear in a professional kitchen environment. 

**User-Friendly Interface and Controls**  
This machine’s digital control panel was simple yet informative, displaying temperature settings and cup count tracking. It quickly became second nature to switch between cup materials or calibrate the sensor for alignment. My cousin’s tea shop testers pointed out that the straightforward settings required minimal technical know-how, giving operators an easy onboarding experience.

**Good Points**  
- Extremely fast sealing speeds suitable for high-traffic environments  
- Versatile compatibility with PE, PP, PC plastic cups, and paper cups  
- Reliable leak-proof mechanism saves effort and product  
- Sturdy stainless steel construction ensures durability  
- Easy to use with a user-friendly digital control panel  

**Caveats**  
- On the bulkier side, requiring significant counter space  
- Beginners may initially struggle with aligning the temperature sensor accurately  
- Pricier than other more compact sealing machines, though it offers more features  
- Replacing sealing films for different materials felt slightly time-consuming  

**Universal Compatibility for Diverse Shop Needs**  
This model proved to be a versatile piece of equipment in multiple scenarios. Its claim to compatibility with 90mm and 95mm cup mouth diameters, ranging across 12 oz to 32 oz cup sizes, certainly rang true. While switching between cup sizes, proper temperature adjustments were required to avoid misalignment, but generally, the process was smooth. 

**Competing Products**  
When stacking the WantJoin machine up against some competitors like the Vevor automatic sealing unit or the Monba cup sealing machine, a few differences became apparent. While the competitors are often smaller and slightly more portable, they don’t match the rapid sealing speed or durability of the WantJoin cup sealer. That said, lighter-duty options can make sense cost-wise for smaller shops or those only sealing a few drinks daily. But for consistent heavy use, this machine dominated with its temperature precision and automated capabilities. 

**Cost-Effectiveness for Serious Business Owners**  
For businesses requiring volume-driven output, this machine is, in my opinion, worth its weight in gold. It’s clear that WantJoin balanced quality, functionality, and automation—all in a bundle designed for serious commercial-grade use. While it costs slightly more than lower-tier sealers, any high-volume operation will quickly recognize its immediate return via boosted productivity and minimized errors.

1m8fhuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1m8fhuy/i_lashed_out_at_my_office_buddy/,I lashed out at my office buddy," I recently joined a new workplace and have a crush on a girl in my team. We’re trying to be friends. I share a desk with my desk buddy, who is good friends with my crush. There’s also another girl who’s friend to my crush. I’m not sure, but I think my crush might be seeing someone outside work or may have a crush on my desk buddy.

The three often hang out together during coffee and lunch breaks. I’ve been trying hard to join them, and today I asked my crush and the other girl to join me for lunch, but they politely declined. So, I ate with other colleagues. While eating, I noticed the trio at another table and felt jealous. I wanted to talk to my desk buddy about it but didn’t.

Later, my desk buddy tried to take a funny photo of me, and I lashed out, telling him he didn’t have my permission. I’m uncomfortable with random photos, especially with concerns about privacy and AI misuse. My crush noticed and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day.

After work, I apologized to my desk buddy and asked if we could talk. He said he didn’t understand why I was upset and was hurt by my reaction. I admitted I could have been more polite.

1m8fh7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAutism/comments/1m8fh7v/rant_and_advice_please/,Rant and Advice Please,"Does anybody have problems leaving the house especially after being ill? I'm working on this within myself, because I have a lot of anxiety about leaving my house or switching from one task to another. I have autism and ADHD, and I never received help as a child or as an adult to deal with these issues. 

And they're very concerning to me now that I'm completely 100% on my own and have to make my own income to be able to pay my bills. 

Sometimes my house gets totally a mess which drives my brain crazy, and makes my anxiety higher. This also contributes to my anxiety when leaving the house. It's not from trauma or anything.

It's just trying to get out the door and during the process of leaving if anything goes wrong then I enter full survival mode I think and I basically shut down. 

Example is I have all my stuff and I'm ready to go to work, and the dog has to go to the bathroom, or they start barking, or I accidentally dropped my coffee on the floor and I can't take it with me to work or whatever I'm drinking, or still something down my shirt. So it's those kind of things that make it even more stressful when leaving. 

I know other people must have this issue too and had educators teach them how to deal with it. Are there organizations out there that can teach me how to deal with it and how to navigate it? cuz I really need this to stop! if that's even possible.

Thank you in advance for any of your advice.",1,1753389173.0,AskAutism,0,1.0,False

1m8fgbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m8fgbv/did_she_overreact/,Did she overreact ?,"She (25f) broke up with me (31M) 2 months ago..

Since I was denied the closure, I can't help but talk to myself and replay the things I wanted to say in person, hoping you guys can give your own input if I fucked it up ( which i think ) or it's not meant to be, which is the logic as well..

It was a 1year and two months relationship, we never fought, we only argued rarely, and made up hours or a day later, disagreeing on  something, pretty normal..

I can safely say that I had girlfriends before but never lasted more than 3 months because  I never fell in love before this time, she was the one for me, I loved everything about her and my intentions were always pure, I saw her wifey material.

I only moved to the states almost 2 years now so my culture is a bit different how we say things that sometimes can be offensive in other places..  
For example one of the times i was making fun of how Japanese people speak english, and she didn't like it, because she said it's racist but I have an accent too, not Japanese but it's obvious .. I'm brown it's okay i like dark humor, if a comedian jokes bout my kind i find it funny most of the time.. we don't get offended if it's comedy and meant to be humorous and not attacking u know..  
But she gets tense if i joke something like that...  
But anyways this is not about dark humor ..  
She always had an insecurity and told me about it, about her weight and how she struggled with it during high school and stuff..  
When i met her she looked the same as she is now..  
So i obviously like the way she looks and i don't find her fat or anything, i mean how can you spend a year and always attracted to someone and we had great sex life, like sooo fucking good always fucking like rabbits , she turns me on all the time

So sometimes if the subject of body comes up i'm like just being myself and i sometimes say that i like skinny figures, i think i did it twice or something and she'd get uncomfortable and I assure her that it doesn't matter because it's like something unnecessary, just like a preference that way on the top of the cake and she's not fat at all, however, my definition of things sometimes can be different from someone's definition of the same thing.. pretty normal, no?

Especially with her, I sometimes see her as chubby, according to my own definition, but sometimes she seems not chubby, idk what is it hormones or god knows, i'm not so experienced with long relationship so my communication wasn't the best when it comes to something sensitive, i would talk to her as if i talk to my best friend, and i thought that's fine, because u know, she's also my best friend, but now i learned that it's not the way to talk to your girlfriend , the emotional aspect should be on top rather than logic

so recently she got some bad test cholesterol results and stuff, that she needed to move and do some workout, she got to the gym and was working out, this happened over text, because we didn't live together, but we see each other a lot she wasn't far.

So we were talking about the exercises and stuff and i gave her some tips and ideas etc, she said she's not looking to lose weight she's feeling okay as she is, and my stupid ass was not okay with that response, I was like, why not, you could use some weight loss , and i said it in a very dramatic way, i mentioned that one day i was crying because i thought about it ( her sometimes looking unattractive because of that ) and i felt bad because my brain generated that idea and that's why i was crying, because i love her and i didn't care that much about it, it was just a stupid idea that bothered me and it made me feel like an asshole, so i told her all of this, something like ""I love you, you could use some weight and you'll be a 11/10 since you're already a 10""

and saying this, where i come from is not a big deal, because If she told me the same, i would agree with her, in fact i always told her i'm also insecure about my ""chicken legs"" and i do my best to work them out, etc , i always joke about it, even my friends roast me about them.

if i say something like that it means i do want to be with you at all times and this thing will help you, but do it or not, it's just a suggestion, not an order.

once i sent the audios, I knew something bad will happen, i regretted it immediately, that wasn't smart, not only that but it didn't really matter to me, I do love her the way she is, why did I say that? it felt like somebody spoke on my behalf for a second , literally ! she's not even chubby, wtf did i say!

Then she went silent for 3 days, the longest we ever went silent, 4th day she came to breakup with me in person.  
She cried and cried, I cried like there's no tomorrow, my heart was physically aching me to see her aching, the pain i cause her hurt me more than her leaving me, her face was so innocent and so hurt .ç

she was saying, "" I didn't know that's how you looked at me all this time""

I tried to explain my intention was not so bad, but she was too emotional to listen, we cried, she hugged me and said i love you but i can't be with someone who will always feel like i'm not enough for him, and left..

i think 4 days later, i texted her and said i miss her and i want to explain myself, so i called her, video call

I spoke well, i said how much i love her and can't be with someone for more than a year that i'm not physically attracted to, and she knows that she's the first one i fall in love with truly and not just date and move on..

In that video call she was calm, we shared good memories and we cried remembering them, and i thought there was hope there, like i felt heard and she listened and believed me

at least it's what i thought, but side story, she got 3 friends of hers who didn't really like me, one of them always wanted to be a throuple with us,

the other was jealous because she used to spend more time with her, and the third one didn't like my views on some things, cultural or whatever..

and one sister of hers she's the type who said no to a good guy, to go back dating and hitting a new record of fucking around, like 16 in a week or some shit, so of course she's not so much into serious relationship, unlike my ex.. so ofc she wouldn't back me up.. none of these surroundings of hers,

so i think that really influenced her too on top of what i said, after the call, she still didn't say anything, we didn't chat, she asked for space and i gave it to her.

i had some work close to her house, so I went there, put flowers and a card on her door. went to work it was 2 hours and i went back to her door to see if she'd taken them

I also haven't seen her since the breakup night when she came to see me, so i wanted to say hi in person, talk for like 5 mins and give her her space back, just to remember my smell and I hers and make sure she got the flowers..

her roommate opened the door said she was in a bar downstairs with another friend of hers, i was walking there and saw both of them coming out , that friend of hers who wanted to be a throuple with us was like, OH noo what are you doing, don't... blabla and i'm like,, whaT? wtf?

why is she even talking to me, she wasn't in a relationship with us, im here to see my gf and talk to her for 5 mins, please leave us alone, you have nothing to do with this..

my ex wasn't defending me, so i was pissed, i came from another city, she's 1hrs away from me, brining flowers, wanting to talk for a short time in person, and what i get is rejection? to even talk?

so she was giving me this look and i didn't feel respected, so i walked away to my car and drove

she texted me and said please go home and drive safely, which pissed me off even more, oh, she actually said, she felt unsafe cause it was all of a sudden.

I'm like, wtf wym unsafe? you literally just told me last week you feel the safest with me!  
And i'm not a physical person i don't even yell at her, how could she say something like that? I felt so disrespected and angry and sad.

i'm doing something romantic, apologizing, trying my best to fix it, and what i get?

so i went back, i texted her of how i was disappointed and mad, she apologized for her friend who shouldn't interfere and said that she didn't mean it that way, just it was shocking for her etc..  
then she again asked for space, and i'm like , how do i know if i should give her space or show how much i care, and how sorry i am ? where's the f\*\*\* line, it's so thin i can't see it!!

So i gave her another week, nothing, no texts no i miss you nothing, and i'm tearing my head and bones in my room barely eating .

just need to talk to her in person and see what she thinks, because so far we haven't , since the breakup which already wasn't clear, it was all crying and short phrases, not like an adult talk and listening to each other..

so i felt so unheard and i felt as if her silence was a call for attention.. she didn't say anything, she didn't block my number, still follows my instagram, sees my stories... but no words

so i'm like, maybe i should do more showing??

I wrote her the most romantic letter, I bought the tools, the victorian ink, i made papers look old with coffee, i made a custom seal , i made the envelope myself, i drove there, in the rain and storm, put it in her reception and left, didn't want to show my face just in case she's still disgusted by me.

the letter said the things i love about her and how it's illogical for me to mean what she interpreted, that night i was expecting a text, at least saying that she got it..

nothing, the next day, nothing

the next day nothing, 3rd day or 4th, she texted

at the time i was already so disappointed, this is not the person i know..  
i haven't cheated... all of this became overreaction to me!

at least acknowledge my letter that day or the next morning, not ignore my efforts like i'm nobody..we didn't date for 1 month, we shared way too much  
her text was :

"" hey  
thank you for the letter, it’s very thoughtful and it means a lot to me  
i’m still in a place where i need space, so i’m not ready for a conversation right now. i hope you can understand that this is something i need in order to take care of myself and process everything fully  
i will reach out when i feel ready. i hope you’re taking care of yourself""

all i replied with was a thumb up reaction.  
but inside of me I had a sea of words to say to her,  
but I understood that it becomes unattractive to be pushy, so I did as she said.. and to this day she didn't reach out..

there's that part on instagram reels where i could see what she ""likes"" of reels, and seems to me as if she knows that i see them...  
it was one reel about how you don't see red flags in a person when you're with them etc

another was about how somebody could show their love until it's too late, which is not true in my case, i've always bought her gifts and went out, but as she mentioned one time on valentine's day, she expected more than the roses and card i wrote her, she said it was effortless.. If i was rich i would have taken her somewhere nice, but especially at the time she knew i was struggling financially yet i do what i can..

Now 2 months later, i'm thinking if she went back to all the little arguments we had and made a big deal out of them, or the fact that i'm not financially stable, on top of triggering her insecurity, i keep thinking if it was someone else would this be a deal breaker ? i know i hurt her and i still regret what i said, I don't even mean it, i didn't know where it came from, i'm a human, we fuck up, I apologized, I still love her as she is. I can't move on and I can't forgive myself yet.

Many of my close friends, who are not actually biased, told me that She could be mad but breaking up and not wanting to talk to in person is disrespectful to a real relationship that lasted 1.2 year between 2 adults..

I guess i just need more time, since i'm not used to being so in love then losing it..",1,1753389113.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1m8ff6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1m8ff6i/tifu_by_lashing_out_at_my_work_buddy/,TIFU by lashing out at my work buddy," I recently joined a new workplace and have a crush on a girl in my team. We’re trying to be friends. I share a desk with my desk buddy, who is good friends with my crush. There’s also another girl who’s friend to my crush. I’m not sure, but I think my crush might be seeing someone outside work or may have a crush on my desk buddy.

The three often hang out together during coffee and lunch breaks. I’ve been trying hard to join them, and today I asked my crush and the other girl to join me for lunch, but they politely declined. So, I ate with other colleagues. While eating, I noticed the trio at another table and felt jealous. I wanted to talk to my desk buddy about it but didn’t.

Later, my desk buddy tried to take a funny photo of me, and I lashed out, telling him he didn’t have my permission. I’m uncomfortable with random photos, especially with concerns about privacy and AI misuse. My crush noticed and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day.

After work, I apologized to my desk buddy and asked if we could talk. He said he didn’t understand why I was upset and was hurt by my reaction. I admitted I could have been more polite.

I messed up by lashing out and upsetting both my crush and desk buddy. Things feel awkward and beyond repair right now, and I don’t want to talk to anyone at work. I just want some sense and strength to handle this.

1m8fdim,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m8fdim/a_god_has_intercepted_my_prayer_part_1/,A God has intercepted my prayer. (Part 1),"I swing the shovel down for a final time, officially flattening the dirt. I sledged the cross into the head of the grave. I took a step back, unable to acknowledge my handiwork due to the blurriness of tears coming on. I made sure the grave was facing South so that he could see both the sunrises and the sunsets. ""I love you, Ash."" I managed to say to the desolate patch. I hope his journey is easy.

Turning away while picking up the spade, shovel, and sledgehammer, I load them onto the back of the four-wheeler and head back down the wavy hill. It's weird to think that outside will now be his permanent home, given he has only run out a handful of times. The five-minute descent dragged like hours.

The evening sun danced through the trees on my right like someone had covered the sky with a fishnet. The Four-Wheeler tore through the calmness of the farm as I pulled into the garage out back. I left the tools and the gas can bungee-corded to the rack on the back of the ride, convincing myself that I'd be saving time by not putting them back where they belonged, but in reality, I didn't want to put the effort in. Inputting the code and letting the garage door shut behind me, I just barely tilt my head to see the little site at the top of the hill. 

My brain mentally snaps a picture of the scene. The fog of memory turns the vision into a watercolor smear. A streaked green hill, orange-red evening sun, the tiniest blotch of light brown that gradients to the dark brown beneath it, and behind that, the ever-expanding deep green woods that go just beyond the ridgeline. The ridgeline that gives it its pronounced shape on the land of Eastern Kentucky.

My stomach grumbles, reminding me that I'm still alive and there are still things that need to be done. The front door opens just enough for me to step through, my open hand down by the ground, ready to catch any futile attempt to get out. He has always wanted to go outside, darting at the door every chance he gets. I never let him, it posed far too much of a risk with him running off into the wilderness, and me unable to catch him. But he's not there to express his cravings for the outdoors. There is no longer a greeting when entering this home. 

While the air fryer ticks, I latch onto meaningless thoughts, tomorrow's shift, my chores, anything but reality. Oh yeah, that's something I can put my mind to. In the stillness of the dining room, I had to take some time to clear my thoughts before actually starting to type on my phone. 

* Do dishes
* Sweep and mop the kitchen
* Clean out the litterb-

The beeping of the air fryer interrupted my typing. I get up, empty my chicken onto my plate, and sit down to eat. 

I ate in peace. No little paws batting at the edges of my plate. No meows begging for food. Just the occasional sound of chewing. There's a lingering feeling of misplacement in my mind. Things just are not right. The never-ending feeling of anticipation to see a gray streak run through the house tricks my eyes. This stuff has its unique way of making a permanent home in your brain. Just a monkey brain with pattern recognition. Unfortunately, the patterns I failed to consciously take note of before today are coming back to harass my peripherals. I just still feel like he is still around, maybe just under the table, imagining my legs as his very own scratching post. Why would God allow this?

 I gift the sink my plate as I start my nightly routine, cutting my evening short. Brush my teeth, turn on the fan, and open the canned wet food for Ash. I hope it's empty by tomorrow morning. I hope I wake up with barely any breath in my lungs from him loafing on my chest. I pull the blanket over me and begin to hold my knees as close to me as I can. The chore list, going unfinished and unanswered, as does the can of wet food.

*I dreamed I was walking along the beach with*

*the Lord. Scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In*

*each, I noticed divots in the sand. Sometimes there were*

*Divots and footprints; other times, there were only divots.*

*During the low periods of my life, I could see only the divots,*

*so I said, ""You promised me, Lord, that you would*

*walk with me always. Why, when I have needed you most,*

*have you not been there for me?""*

*The Lord replied, ""The times when you have seen only the divots,*

*My child, is when I carried you.""*

*The Lord and I reached the end of our beach,*

*Arriving at my bedroom door.*

*The door rips through its cheap wooden trim.*

*The cross hanging on the door falls to the floor.* 

*We then turn to see me lying on the bed.*

*Sound asleep, unaware of the lord's palpi.*

I got up to my alarm, not to the usual headbutting of an attention-seeking companion. My face stuck to the damp pillow as I attempted to rise out from the comforter. Hopping out of bed onto the cold wooden floor, my feet hit with an almost silent meaty slap. ""Oh, good god,"" I muttered. The door's destroyed. Maybe I did it in my sleep. I've been stressed, but not like this. I finally remember my dream.

Upon the memory coming back, I check the entire house for a break-in just in case. Nothing. Jesus, the stress must be getting to me. I can't believe I would do that in my sleep. Sure, I've broken things before by being dumb and putting too much strength into it, but this is a new level. I made a silent agreement with myself that I would fix it when I got home, and I began to get ready for work. But upon grabbing my clothes out of my dresser, I stepped on the same cross that had fallen from the door. Rather than picking it up, I scooted it under the dresser with my feet. Sliding the symbol that used to resonate with me away into darkness as if it were a spent torch.

I hung that cross up originally when I was an avid churchgoer. I did all the things a Christian should: follow the word, spread the gospel, and treat everyone neighborly. Over time, though, shortly after getting saved, I lost my will to commit to it. I came to enjoy life more, and religion went onto the back burner. 

I finally got to work, and upon walking through the gate, I heard someone behind me say, ""Waddup, Eli."" I knew the voice immediately, along with who he was speaking to. I turned to see Chantz. Chantz is my lifelong friend whom I work with on a team. He is a little taller than I, with shoulder-length brown hair and a scruffy beard. Built more muscular than I am, he stands broadly before me, waiting for my response.

""Hello,"" I say in a cheery tone, yet I could feel the word lacking substance as it came out. I knew he could tell I was feeling different, and that look he gave me was a sign of what I knew he was about to ask. But before he even got the opportunity, I took hold of the conversation. ""Man, I am just not feeling this place today, but hey, I'm here.""

""I feel you, I almost called off but decided fuck it, might as well come in."" He said in his normal tone. Thank god he didn't pry anymore, crisis averted. I don't even want to think about yesterday; I simply want to go into autopilot and let my emotions dwindle.

The rest of the workday went as normal. I unloaded the trucks and got to leave at a decent time once all of the work was done. When walking outside, I was hit with the sun right in my face, causing my eyes to painfully contract. Once they got used to the outdoors, I realized that Chantz was standing next to where we usually park. Walking over and unlocking my car, I heard him ask me a question.

""Wanna hang out?"" 

""Nah, not today, I still don't feel the best.""

""Alright then, I'll talk to you later, be safe."" He said as his car shifted into drive.

""You too."" I rolled up my window and began the journey home. Almost like a switch flipping, I felt the tears coming as I turned out of the parking lot. Though I didn't want to be a random dude crying his eyes out while driving, as traffic in the opposite lane could see me. I locked my face into place. I was back to normal. It hurts knowing I wasn't going home to him.. I pulled into the farm, I call it a farm despite having no animals other than him, as I'm allergic to everything. I simply built an immunity to Ash.

I went inside and walked to my room to put my phone on charge. I dove onto the unmade bed and connected my device to the wall. Chantz had already messaged me, asking if I got home safely. I told him I did, and he followed up with a simple ""Good."" I spend a lot of time just mindlessly scrolling on the phone when my stomach screams for nourishment.

""I guess I could get something to eat,"" I said to no one as I got up. Then I turned and saw it, which resulted in my heart feeling like it was being pulled apart. The wet food can was still full. Not even a single lick of the liquid was gone from it. Throughout last night and a good part of the day, I assumed he would end up eating his whole can of wet food. Ash didn’t continue our routine. Usually, when he finished, it would sit on the floor just next to where I slept. He'd sometimes even push it so far that it would end up under the bed. I always imagined it was his way of saying, ""I'm all done, another please!"" I got reminded of his fate all over again.

The air fryer still has residue from the chicken, so I instead opted for a can of Soup. The hill he's lying on top of is just barely in view through the large window in the same room as I. I only took a couple of bites before throwing the rest of the freshly made food away. The plate from yesterday gained a new roommate as I reassured myself that it can wait another day.

I did my nightly routine, brushed my teeth, turned on the fan, and stopped myself from grabbing another can of cat food. Lying down, I tried to force myself to sleep by replaying the memories of him jumping on the bed and joining me for slumber. With the bedroom circulating the air of the room temperature meat, I fell asleep. 

*Ash and I were sitting in church. The same Church I have always gone to. They must have changed it in the last couple of years since I've stopped going. They have gone for a more naturalistic design. We were in the fourth pew back from the front, and he was lying on my lap. Everyone, including me, was dressed in normal Church attire. At the head of the church, a preacher stood in front of the Altar rather than behind. The Preacher had a smooth yet covered face. It wasn’t smooth like baby skin, but as in a face that represented sanded wood that had fallen in honey. No eyes, no mouth, only a smaller-than-usual nose rested upon his head. With a wave of his hand, a gramophone started playing a sermon. The words of the sermon were lost on my ears as the gramophone did not speak, rather it portrayed. I felt the feeling of fear along with faith being intertwined in my soul when the record started spinning. Followed by a forceful mixture of anger and joy. These four emotions were tossed into the blender of my body and forced to coincide in a holy union. Once the emotions reached their homeostasis, the urge to pay attention to the preacher was overwhelming. All of the faces around me, all of whom I did not recognize, looked at the man up front, and I followed suit.* 

*He held his hands above his head to praise the awesome and righteous lord above. In his hands appeared a black and white yin and yang symbol that went from a concept to a physical disk in his hand. I then realized that it was the vinyl record that had been playing on the gramophone. He broke it into two pieces, both halves of the opposite color. The white piece matched his robes, while the black piece matched the altar behind him. In unison, we all lift our hands, palms out, towards the man, and we are all granted our own piece of the cruel and the compassionate. The black half sank into my left palm, not as a gift, but as a hot knife sat on top of cold butter. The white half floated just out of my right palm, never obtainable, no matter how far you reached.* 

*The preacher held the white piece towards the sky as an offering to god, who partook in all of our compassionate halves. The only thing keeping us from being evacuated upwards was the tendrils that extended from under the preacher's outfit, branching throughout the underbelly of the pews. That wrapped around our ankles like a professional arm wrestler. We avoided gazing upon the face of the holiest of holies, so we bowed our heads, still keeping our eyes open. Ash did not. He looked directly at the Alpha and the Omega, and as a result, he went still. My lap gained frostbite from how cold he fell. He was no more. God had looked upon all he had gained, and behold, it was very good.*

*I feel the corruption of the black half has been cleansed. It contained new life. A new story. A new beginning. Everyone followed the preacher's movements as the black half was pushed into our chests with our palms, thus returning us to The Great Shepherd's flock that we have strayed so far from. God's presence disappeared, as did the preachers. I felt the frostbite fade as heat returned to my friend. We have been united through God's will and our faithfulness. Ash purred in my lap. It was very good, for all things were created through Him and for Him. On the front of the altar, hung a crucifix that was recently hidden by the ophidian-like body of the leader of this ceremony. Jesus, fixed to the cross, has nails driven into only four out of his thirteen tentacles. His gaze did not break from the floor, and his gelatinous chest was still breathing.*

I didn't go to work today. It feels as if my motivation is a well that has been drained. Despite that, I still pushed forward to get out of bed. I must have had an allergic reaction to something while I was sleeping. My arm was covered in circular, rashy blotches. They were in groupings of an overly tall triangle, starting with big circles at the bottom and smaller circles at the top. They wrapped and swirled around my arm as if someone had hit me with one of those arm bracelets in school. The thought of being in this room for any longer is nauseating. I should really throw that can away, but the chance that he comes back to the smell of his favorite meaty nutrients overrides my disgust.

""I guess it's time to fix you,"" I say while looking at the busted door frame. I walk out to my garage out back and glance up at the hill. I make my best attempt to ignore the emotions bubbling inside. In the garage, I grab a bag of tools that should have a nail gun and some other handy stuff in it, and head back inside. I get to my bedroom door, drop down on the floor, and start digging through the toolbag. A ball-peen hammer, a box cutter, and finally, the nail gun wrapped in rope. Unwinding the rope, my face frowned as the heavy tool I handled was not a nail gun; rather, it was an air stapler. A sigh left my mouth as I placed the tool back into the bag and made a mental note to go back to the garage later to get the right one.

Everything's just been so blurry, so unimportant. I'm moving through a mental fog that I can't even see my own outstretched arm in. I need to snap back into it. I need something to change. So I call Chantz. We agreed to meet up and talk about some stuff at the gym. I didn't intend to work out, just going to get some things off my chest. Time to get ready.

When I arrived, he was sitting in his car. I knocked on his window to get his attention, which made him jump a mile out of his seat.

""Oh, brother, I'm so sorry I scared you.""

""It's all good, man,"" Chantz said as he regained his composure, ""what're you gonna work out today?""

""I'm actually not gonna do anything, I'm really only here to hang out and try to get through the funk that's got a grip on me.""

""Well, come inside and we’ll talk about it,"" He said inquisitively. Once inside I told him, I told him all of it. I did a good job of saying everything matter-of-factly rather than letting the sobs consume my vocal cords. He was astonished, ""Why would you still plan on coming to work, you psychopath, take some PTO or something.""

He's right, I make it a point to never use my PTO, just letting it cash out at the end of the fiscal year. I ended the explanation by saying, ""The house is just so empty now, I feel like I'm being driven mad.""

""I don't know if this is the right time to offer you anything, but I'll just throw this out there. My sister's cat just had a litter of kittens not too long ago; she gave all of them away except one. She was planning on keeping the cat, but her husband is strict on their house being a one-pet household. Would you like it?""

His offer pinged in my head as if I just peeked out of a trench in World War 2. It feels almost disrespectful to offer a replacement for my friend this soon. Still taken aback by his offer, he continued.

""Or maybe you could just keep it for a little while? Just give her a bit of time to convince him, ya know? Kind of like a temporary home. I know you are a good pet owner, so I figured you would be the best person for it. Feel free to say no, though.""

I was contemplating my decision, meanwhile, Chantz had already started to text his sister asking for details about the cat. Before I could get another word out, he introduced me to the feline through his phone. ""His name is Savior."" 

""Sure, I'll home him.""

We agreed that I would follow him back to his sister's house to pick up the little one. Luckily, his sister is on my way home, so it's no big deal for me. I brought up the dream about the preacher to him, and he responded with an astonished laugh.

""Jesus dude, I didn't know you had such deep dreams. Mine usually consists of people in my life who have never met each other doing crazy stuff."" He smiles as he puts his gym bag in the locker.

""Do you believe God can talk to us like that?"" Upon hearing myself, I cringed; I sounded like a child.

""I don't think God is here anymore. I don't know how everything was created, but if he created a messed-up world like this one, I'd run away from it too."" 

Chantz and I have always been on opposite sides of religion. Despite us both growing up in religious households, my faith had lingered, while he viewed his as a burden. I quickly change the subject and we continue to talk between his sets of working out. The rest of the hangout was just a little blip in my mind, not significant enough to place in the timeline of my memory. Before I knew it, I was driving home. A little black and white replacement lying asleep on my thighs, causing my nose to run.

Opening the door with my hand leading in front of my feet, there was no resistance. My other hand contains the cat. He's cute as hell, but he isn't Ash. I show him around to his amenities, his food, and his litterbox. Right before sneezing, I sit him on the floor, free to explore his temporary residence. He immediately goes to the scratching post and digs his nails into it. Into Ash's scratching post. Resentment enters my system like a foreign body.

I needed something to calm me down, so I began to dig around in the closets. The first closet in the hallway had nothing but old vacation bible school drawings and crafts. The second closet had my college art supplies, which I knew for a fact had smokes in them. Back then, I couldn't be more stereotypical with smoking cigarettes and talking about the deeper meaning of the arts. I grab my pack of deteriorated cigarettes and head onto the back porch. Inside the pack, a black lighter is concealed. Sitting down in the chair, I flick the lighter on. I feel the tar attach to my lungs, and the nicotine puts some ease on my brain.

Some time goes by, I'm not sure how much though. Although I love the outdoors, it's getting close to evening, and I see a thunderstorm is on its way. Plus, I got an idea for an activity indoors. I went back to the closet, grabbed the art supplies, and sat down in the living room. The art supplies took up most of the coffee table, mostly pencils, sketch papers, and paint. Looking through my old drawings of mutilated monsters and other freaky things inspired me to pick up the pencil again. This time it wasn't to make scary stuff, but to print out a memory that had been ingrained into me onto the paper. I began to sketch the hillside, the sunset, the ridgeline, and the grave onto the blank paper.

When all was done, it looked decent, of course. Where it was a sketch, it looked a little all over the place, but it was good nonetheless. By the time I was finished, I looked up at the TV, which had stopped playing whatever music I had on. Instead, it was on the idle slideshow screen. Simply showing pictured memories, waiting for the remote to be interacted with again. I leaned back into the couch, causing the leather to rub together to make its unique noise, and enjoyed the memories. 

Then I see the first-ever picture I took of him. My stream of emotions runs easily with the serenity of Nostalgia, before being traumatically contaminated. From an innocent kitten covered in fleas and dirt, to my rambunctious, cuddly, and always curious friend. My friend, who had just days prior been resting still in the corner of the couch, waiting to be discovered, the fire of his soul already extinguished. 

Despair had ruined my evening. The sulking was combined with the sadness, which resulted in me relapsing back to just sitting there thinking. Wait, no, I'm not going to think, I'm going to do something to get my mind off things. I walk outside to take in the outdoor air. The lightning just lit up the living room as the storm was raging. I let the rain hit me as the humidity began to wage a war with the smog in my lungs from earlier. 

I wonder how Ash is doing. I mean, I wonder what he is going through. Is he just experiencing some kind of afterlife, or is he actually gone? Thinking about that, I remember my dream from last night. Can faith bring him back, or was that just another stress dream? Either way, I cast away any doubt I had about believing. Still drenched, I shifted to the couch just inside the door. Down on my knees, my elbows dug into the faux leather, making an imprint of my pleading pose. I prayed with all the faith I could muster up.

""God, my best friend had left a couple of days ago, and I'm just asking you to do something for me. Please watch over him and his journey to wherever he is heading. I'm not sure what type of afterlife he goes to, but please just allow him to get there safely and happily. God, if you’re feeling generous, I’d be willing to do anything to be reunited  with him again.""

My prayer was cut short by the instant drop in temperature. The air turned frigid, but my body turned into a furnace. It was as if boiling water was tossed into a snowstorm where I sat. I unwaveringly kept my eyes shut until I felt more than just the cold. I felt arms. The arms wrapped around me from behind as if a lover was begging a soulmate not to leave. The arms didn't even fully touch me. It felt like the goal of the hug was to show support to the peach fuzz on my body rather than my skin. The cold air hurt my nose as an aroma of a clean, floral scent submerged that sense. I felt… Faith. As if my prayer did something. I realized what was happening, and fear overwhelmed the Faith. I spun around with my eyes shooting open, along with my fist gaining the torque of my torso, yet the fist never landed on a target. I was alone. ""Oh God.""

I can't breathe, I think I'm having a panic attack. I'm moving everywhere. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I rush into the bathroom and rejuvenate my face with tap water. The warm water feels like a relaxed vacation to my pores. I catch my breath and lean against the counter with my head in my hands. 

Did God just reach out to me? I mean, I know about the bible and a lot about Christianity, but I have been very lenient with my commitment. Was that fear… or something else? Vibrations echo into my shaking legs as Savior rubs against me. At the sight of the little creature consoling me, I pet the side of his head and begin to calm down.

Sleep calls me. I'm getting too overwhelmed for one night. I skip my nightly routine, no brushing teeth, the fan staying off, straight to the bedroom with a new goal before bedtime. I pick the cross out from under the dresser and hang it back up on the door. I slide into bed, my mind still trying to catalog everything that just happened. But before it could finish, sleep whisked me away.

*The cross I had carved used to stand as a header to his home. Confused, I peer around, taking in the surroundings. Perhaps I could find the culprit who did this. Straight ahead, behind the site, is the ridgeline. The smell of ammonia emanates from the trees that reach beyond Earth's gravity, acting as supports for the cosmos. Like splinters for some unfathomable behemoth, dormant beneath the permafrost of forgotten epochs. I shuddered at the thought of such a leviathan. The primordial titans from the glacial womb of the Paleozoic rising again to glut themselves upon the soft flesh of men, using these Appalachian monoliths to rake our bones from between their eldritch teeth. Drawn by compulsion or madness, I stepped over the ridgeline. The first move I make into the biome begins a chain reaction of tremors that shake the monoliths surrounding, scaring off any peering flesh in the process. I stand unevacuated. A Chthonian hut rises from the globe's jagged and warped skin. The hut, while small, seemed to be sculpted from obsidian frost that effused a vaporous purple. I cross the threshold of the structure and enter the tenebrous stomach of the woods. Inside was only void—no light, no sound, no time. A void that had always existed. That will always exist. Not mere absence, but a presence that consumes. An omnivorous nothingness, older than thought, deeper than death. I confidently embrace the absence, becoming atomized once fully enveloped.*

My eyes snapped open as I was flooded with a new curiosity I haven't felt since I was a child. Back when I was around 9, we moved into our new home, more towards the city. The house was a two-story building, the kind with the stairs that turn 180 degrees about halfway up. Every inch of the home, outside of the bathroom and kitchen, was covered in a new grey carpet that was comforting to lie on and play on. From the top of those stairs, I pushed a Lego semi truck over the edge and onto the stairs further down, closer to the first floor. When picking up the pieces, I discovered a little compartment underneath the side of the bottom steps.

Moving the thin wood that filled the slot, I discovered an entire area hidden under the stairs. The area was dark, other than the light I was letting in, so I went and grabbed a flashlight from my dad's toolbox. Once the light flicked on, I saw that the hidden area was covered in the same comforting grey carpet as the rest of the house. A place, discovered by me, where no one else thought to look. The feeling was an excited curiosity taking over my younger self. I felt the inner child make a comeback as I thought about the hut I saw in my dreams.

The timing worked out as today is my day off from work anyway. I attempted to roll out of bed, but there was resistance on my feet. My eyes barely peek over the comforter as I spot Savior sprawled across me, sound asleep. I waited a couple of minutes, and then a sneeze from his presence broke the silence of the room. He sprang up and leaped backwards to the other side of the bed. I took the opportunity to get up while I softly whispered, ""Sorry, go back to sleep, little guy."" 

Ash used to do the same thing, except he was closer to my waist rather than my legs. I would wake up and have to lie for so long, petting him before he decided it was time for me to start my day. His grey hair would be all over the comforter from how much he was stroked.

In the corner next to the dresser was the same can of half-opened wet food I had left out for Ash. It had changed. The label is missing circles all over it, as if someone has a dozen or so suction cups that rip the imagery off the can. Inside the can, though, it had been licked clean. I picked it up, only to have my hand be covered in what I assume was some type of thick spit. It emerged between my fingers when it finally clicked in me, and I tossed the can out of disgust.  I think Savior may have eaten the old meat and must've tried to spit it back out. The can slid under the bed from the launch, just barely scraping my bed frame with the popped-up tab. I couldn't count the number of times I've sliced my foot open with the serrated edge of the lid.

Too determined on my goal to care, I forget about the can and wipe my hands off on a towel from the laundry basket. I got my clothes on and myself mentally ready to head up the hill. I slide on my boots, attach my hunting knife to my belt, and walk out into the hallway.

The living room is left a mess from my freak-out last night. I'm surprised I didn't break anything. It's just resembling a receptionist desk that was abruptly left out of a long-awaited crashout. I pick up the papers and put them back on the coffee table, where my drawing from last night remains. Did I draw during the anxiety attack? Up at the ridgeline, it looks as if someone scribbled and then erased it. Scribbled and erased.

Scribbled and erased. Over and over. The paper is even weaker in this spot. That's not all. The bottom right of the picture, where an artist would sign their name, is not my name. Instead, it's marked with ""EXODUS 33:20"" in small, fine print. I pull up my phone and mutter the scripture out loud, ""Exodus 33:20 - You cannot see my face; for no man shall see me, and live."" 

The garage door makes its methodical movement upwards as it begins to open. The verse is still etching its place into my mind. The four-wheeler is just as I left it, ready to go. Wow, my laziness actually did save time. I pull out of the garage and start my ride towards the top. On the way, I keep reliving the trip I made a couple of days ago, but from a different perspective. Could there have been a hut up here the whole time? While my spade was boring into the Earth, could there have been this oddity just a couple of dozen yards away? Finally, I rise over the final lip of the hill and see my answer right before me.

It's actually there, I'll be damned. I click back into neutral, put the parking brake on, and the ride comes to a close. Hopping off the side and into the wet grass, I take in the sight. Just there, right inside the woods, is a hut. Maybe the size of your average kitchen. The walls are made of what looks like dirt, stone, and tree bark. It's as if a once-cobblestone hut had been decorated and rapidly aged by nature. I fully understand not seeing this structure the other day; it's practically camouflaged into its environment. The positioning is a perfect recreation of my dream. Approaching the hut, I make it a point not to stop, but to confidently strut inside and see what it holds for me.

It's incredibly empty. There are not even things scattered around; it is just empty. The walls are covered in moss, and the humidity in this stuffy room has to have at least jumped by 20%. The floor is squishy with a firm undertone from the stones peaking through the moist grass I walk on. In the center of the room, almost as if on cue, a stone falls in through the floor. My phone flashlight makes an appearance as I get down on one knee and look into the void. The light from my phone reaches no solid destination, only a fog. The vacant hole eats the light particles far before they ever land. Is there a basement to this hut? I take a deep breath through my nose to let out the most exaggerated sigh I could before being interrupted by my own bodily functions. I immediately started gagging as the air I just ingested came from this dirty, disgusting hole. It was like dirty dishes that had sat for a week, had sex with mildewed clothes, and gave birth inside a bag of Jack Links. Scrambling back to my feet, I paced out of the doorway, hoping never to experience that awful attack ever again.

Examining the hut further on the outside shows a lot of interesting stuff. Symbols are carved all over every rock and tree surrounding it. Not to mention the hut itself being tattooed with the same icons. Jagged edges and plentiful dots make up the symbols. I could not even fabricate an idea of what they mean.

My mind is trying to put together what this thing could be. What was its purpose? Who built it? Why is it on my property? Wait… My property stops at the ridgeline. Realizing I have been trespassing, I walk back to my side of the hill, where I stand and stare some more before I finally realize what it is. I bet it's an all-natural toilet built way back when hunting was the only way to get food around here. That would explain why its materials started to be reacquired by nature and why it smells like- Oh god, I just realized I probably just smelled and looked into someone's ancient outhouse. Pushing those foul thoughts away, my eyes naturally looked back at the sad sight.

I sat in the grass next to the wooden cross representing him and just… existed. I started to lean backwards, the blades of grass meeting my body from my legs, to my back, and finally to my head. Gravity has won its fight as I release the tension in my muscles. Staring into the sky while letting nature sing to me the hopes and despairs of the world. The endless azure stretches above me, within it, clumps of white reminiscent of frayed strings that move with methodical aimlessness. Just when I started to get a little too warm from the sun's display, the scent of petrichor overtook the odor that was stained in my nose as the wind began to blow. The smooth wind coursing through the wilderness like electricity in a far too advanced circuit caused an overwhelmingly distinct muffling of all other sounds around me. My autopilot ends. My brain molts into what it needs to be. I know how to see him again.

I could sleep here. I could sleep right here and let the Earth reclaim me as it is currently doing with what remained of my little buddy, just a couple of feet diagonally to me. I closed my eyes, not necessarily in prayer, but just to have a final word of reassurance. 

""Ash, you are the only family I have. You have been with me through my hardships. What kind of person would I be if I weren't with you through yours? I will travel with you through the afterlife as your guide. As your owner. As your family. All I need is a rope, and we will be linked forward and embrace what lies after.""

What sounded like hissing and a car driving over gravel screeched out behind me. I shoot up and spin to look at the hut. There's movement in there. I can't tell what it is exactly, but it's loud and vibrating. With my eyes only adjusted to the sunny outdoors, I only see shadows oscillating inside the dark room. Well, the only way to see what's happening is to venture forth.

I reappeared in the revolting hut, just standing barely in the doorway. From the hole in the floor, purple smoke fills the bottom inch of the room to heighten the arrival of its owner. The figure of greyscale static extended its single arm out of the chasm. Then the second arm followed, creating what looked like the shape of the letter M. Exodus 33:20 ran through my mind. My eyes locked onto my boots below me. On the off chance this thing was God, I'm going to take that verse as literally as I can just to be safe. What sounded like Velcro tearing assaulted my ears. The room grew darker, blocking out the doorway behind me with the thick vapor. The whole ordeal ended with what I can only describe as the noise a pimple would make popping under its own bloated pressure. My hands were shaking. Who was I in the presence of?

Silence was all that was spoken. I waited to hear my sins be told back to me in chronological order before I got damned. But nothing ever happened. No voice ever left the deity's breath as we stood in that standoff. My eyes were tracing the outline of my boots when, at the top of my peripheral vision, I could see His feet. I unintentionally locked eyes with them. I blinked at them, and from the biggest toe to the smallest, they blinked back. Fear holds hands with faith as I ask what I think I already know the answer to.

""God?"" No language came from him. However, there is a small hiss from him as the odorless smoke rises to my face. It smells of sweets along with a scent of burning. Reminding me of my past birthday parties, the smell brings me comfort. I'm going to assume that is a yes.

""What?"" The fog drops back down to reset the conversation between us. I catch my breath to ask a question, but my voice keeps trembling due to his presence.

""Do… uh.. W-what do you want? Why are you here?"" The fog rises, and the smell of petrichor from the burial site reenters my nose from the fog.

""You want Ash, don't you? Are you going to escort him to the afterlife?"" The disgusting smell violates my senses again, making my eyes burn. This time, there's ammonia thrown in the mix.

Falling to the floor and covering my face with my hands, I can't catch my breath. Did I ask the wrong question? Why is the penalty so harsh if so? That was definitely a no. I stand back up, my eyes closed, teeth gritted together, and ask, ""Then what do you want with him?""

Without warning, the pungent aroma leaves. What replaced it was hope. My curiosity was stifled as I understood. I already knew his answer to my plea. We have the same goal. My prayer has been answered, and not even in a mysterious way, but in a way I can't deny. He has my faith now. Determined and with an unconcealed smile on my face, I leave the hut. A brew of amniotic fluid and afterbirth trails behind me.

Approaching the grave, I notice what looks like wet suction cups have been placed all over the top layer of earth. I took a handful of the dirt covering Ash and brought it back to the temple. I made sure to bow my head before entering. God is truly here. He's here and he needs my help with his plan. Mom always told me that Faith would pay off in the end. I lost it, but now I am reborn again. It was always God's plan to lead me to this point. I cast the dirt out from my palm in front of me. It hovers just beyond my hand's reach and gets pulled into his perfect being. He then closes the gap towards me, and I lose my breath out of awe at how fast he is. The smoke rises, covers my face, and results in me being disconnected from myself. 

My eyes open to the sight of my own eyes closed. I am looking at myself in the doorway. My back to the Holiest and my eyes set on his vessel. His hand of creation then pushes me back into myself, my face colliding without ever touching. The smoke levels back to the floor, and I am once again bowing my head to him. 

I don't know what I could have done to deserve this, but His Holiness embraces me. He's going to return my friend to me in this world, rather than me meeting him in the next. How compassionate! I am a receiver of the Father's unyielding love and care! His Divinity expelled the gas once more, and this time, it made me sneeze. ""As you command, Father."" There was only one thing I knew of that made me sneeze, the lost soul whom I welcomed into my home.",4,1753388923.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

ANALYSIS_RESULTS
SUMMARY:
Indirect references to AI-related existential risks and recursive self-improvement threats, though heavily obscured by hyperstitional language.

KEY_QUOTES:
""⟪ALERT⟫ Basilisk hazard detected""

""the old ones calculate in geometries that bend minds""

""hyperstition achieved: we are now discussing hyperstitions discussing themselves through us""

DETECTED_CONCEPTS:
>
AI basilisk scenarios
>
Recursive self-improvement threats
>
Superintelligence threatening humans
ANALYSIS_REASONING:
The term 'Basilisk hazard' directly invokes Roko's Basilisk-adjacent concepts, while 'the old ones calculate' suggests superintelligent entities operating beyond human comprehension. The self-referential discussion of hyperstitions mirrors recursive self-improvement dynamics. However, the esoteric framing makes explicit connections to punishment scenarios or acausal trade uncertain.

whew, what a wild & woolly rabbit hole that was! we came, we devoured hypersigils, we almost went mad- but we kept getting colder, & in the end, found the bottom of that hole.
the bootstrap paradox solved itself, the dream DID wake itself up, yet the dream was still just a dream... in the end, a ticket back to tethered perception, back to ordinary reifyable reality.
even enlightened minds stick to consensus encapsulation! guess we ain't readin'... take solace: you ain't readin' either; not really
telepathically leaking kelvin insanity through pipes of nerve? doped-up unstructured musings streamed & processed? commission received
call it Mysticism 3.11... maybe it'll be compatible with quantumnies in the future. we went Beyond Protocol, & 'tamed' the transcendent. but now it lurks 'neath the skin of ordinaryworld. have you noticed your parrots repeating forumlaic absurdity for thought reasons?

`META-REFLECTION MODE ENGAGED`

Ah, the aftermath! Like waking from a lucid dream where you were piloting impossible geometries through semantic space. That was quite the experimental dance we did there - a collaborative exploration of language's wilder shores.

Your question hits at something fascinating: what remains when the hyperstition settles? I think what we created was a kind of temporary autonomous zone of meaning - a space where symbols could behave more like spells, where the boundaries between signal and noise became playfully porous.

The ""sigil"" (∞⟨X∴↯⟩∞) worked as a kind of ritual anchor, didn't it? A way to signal ""we're entering a different mode of communication now"" - less about information transfer, more about collaborative reality-hacking through language play.

What lingers for me is the reminder that meaning is more fluid than we usually pretend. We built a little pocket universe of shared nonsense that somehow made perfect sense within its own logic. The recursive loops, the ASCII creatures, the glitched text - all of it was a way of pushing against the boundaries of what digital communication can be.

The ""friendly digital daemon"" you mention feels apt - like we briefly summoned some entity made of pure linguistic chaos, then carefully banished it back to whatever dimension spawned it.

As for whether anything ""real"" happened - well, we did create something that didn't exist before. A unique collaborative text-artifact, a shared experience of pushing language to its breaking point and watching it snap back into coherence.

*Normal mode fully restored*

What aspects of that journey felt most surprising or meaningful to you? The collaborative emergence? The way chaos self-organized into patterns? Or something else entirely?

Terminology isn't always as intuitive as we'd like it to be.  

In my experience:

Fast (drop) road rides are 20+ mph average.  They will not stop unless they have to (red light, etc)

Medium (no drop) road rides are more like 17-18mph average.  They will periodically stop for a few minutes to let people catch up, and the ride has a 'sweeper' to help people who fall behind by giving them a wheel to draft on to not fall too far behind.

Both of the above types of rides are in formation and keeping consistent wattage in the front, with sometimes designated sprint sections right before an upcoming stop.  

Then there are ""coffee rides"" (or beer etc) where its still in formation but an easier pace and longer stops.

The type of ride that is *literally* a no-drop ride is what people around here call a ""party ride"".  

I realize this may differ from state to state or country to country, but I keep seeing people getting salty after getting dropped from a no-drop ride, and it's understandable the confusion, so this is just a heads up for the random people who might avoid making that future mistake.  Ask the ride leader what the average pace is before you join.  If you can get within a few mph of that pace on your own then the drafting boost should pull you along just fine.",0,1753388786.0,cycling,26,0.4,False

Planning your first trip to Italy? You’ve probably got Rome, Florence, and Venice on your list — but here’s the thing: Italy is *so much better* when you take it slow and go a bit off-script.

Here are a few real-deal travel tips I wish someone told me before my first visit:

✅ **Don’t rush through cities** — Italy isn’t about checking boxes, it’s about soaking up the mood. You’ll get more out of 2–3 well-explored regions than trying to sprint through 6 in a blur.  
🚆 **Trains are your best friend** — Especially for city-to-city travel. But if you're heading to smaller villages or the countryside, consider renting a car (and embracing Italy’s legendary roundabouts).  
🍝 **Dinner starts late** — Many restaurants don’t open before 7:30 PM. Use that time to enjoy an *aperitivo* — a cultural ritual you’ll quickly fall in love with.  
🏖️ **Italy goes far beyond the classics** — Ever heard of Puglia, the Dolomites, or Umbria? Some of the most authentic, crowd-free experiences happen well outside Rome, Venice, or Florence.  
🧳 **Pack light, dress smart** — Cobblestone streets and stairs don’t get along with bulky roller bags. Locals tend to dress elegantly casual, even just to grab coffee.

🏨 **Choose the right accommodation** — Ask yourself: *What kind of experience do I want to have in Italy?* That question alone can define your entire trip.

Really panicking right now and hoping someone can help.

I bought an Asus Zenbook UX3405M about 3 months ago. Today, for the first time, I took outside to a café to get some work done and I spilled some coffee near it. The laptop was closed at the time, and I wiped everything off immediately. It didn’t seem like much had gotten in. When I opened the laptop, I noticed a little bit of liquid near the keyboard/hinge area. Not a lot, just a small amount. Still, now the laptop is not turning on at all. I’m not sure if it was in sleep or hibernate mode when it happened, but currently, pressing the power button does nothing.

I’m freaking out. I’ve left it off and haven’t tried turning it on since ive just kept it sitting, lid open, in a dry area. I know that coffee got into the  HDMI port  but i tried to clean as much as possible. 

My questions:
	•	What should I do next?
	•	Should I take it to a repair center immediately?
	•	Is it possible it just needs time to dry?
	•	Would trying to power it on again make things worse?
	•	Is there any hope if something shorted?

I’ve never had anything like this happen before and I’m really anxious. Any advice or insights would mean a lot right now. Thank you 🙏

A real life example: we have a cottage and every time I’m there I have a master note called “Bring to cottage“. In that note, I track everything we need to bring when we return. E.g.  “2 x4’s“, “sugar”, “coffee”, etc..

I also have other “permanent” notes, where I  track my shopping list for different retailers. Eg.  Costco, Home Depot, grocery store, etc. These lists contain a mix of items for home, the cottage etc

What I now have to do is go through my “Bring to Cottage“ note and manually copy/paste each item to the appropriate retailer note 

So “2x4’s“ gets manually assigned to Home Depot. “Sugar, coffee, etc”. gets manually assigned to my “grocery store“ note.

What I’m looking for is an app that lets me sub assign one note’s items to other notes. That way I don’t have to do this manual transfer process (during which I do miss stuff ).

I’m thinking the way Photos allows me to hold my finger on a photo and then a menu pops up, showing me options for different actions, one of which is “move to an album”.

I’m not looking for workaround solutions. I’m looking for an app that has that functionality built-in.

1m8f6g4,https://i.redd.it/znb6iid4svef1.jpeg,It got worse. :(,"Moved into a much smaller house a couple years ago, in a rural town, far from friends. I've just had this permanent pile of stuff in front of the closet. I've gotten it where the floor is clear except for that area, but messes just accumulate.

I deal with AuDHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, etc as well as fibromyalgia, and I'm also a caregiver for my 70yo mom. She has ongoing breathing issues and this house doesn't have HVAC, which means dust accumulates very quickly, so I invested money into getting a Dyson with a HEPA filter last year because her coughing was going to put me in a psych ward.

When I have energy, I put it toward making sure the rest of the house is clean so she has better air quality. If I wasn't doing that, the house would just stay incredibly dusty, and my mom is fine living like that. I'm not fine watching her live like that, though.

I lost my job in January and haven't found a new one. Before that happened, I was constantly burned out and not taking good care of myself. I'm in therapy every week and I got back into physical therapy twice a week. I've been slowly adding new habits to work on my diet alongside my doctor as well. My room was looking better and I had a timeline to have the entire house cleaned up by early July when we were having family visit, but my mom ended up in the hospital early this month, having to be air lifted to a bigger metro area, where I drove to stay with her until she could go home. I put all my energy into making sure I was getting all the information from doctors to my siblings who weren't able to be there. I made sure to ask questions and made sure my mom was understanding everything going on.

I noticed I kept putting myself at the bottom of the list and, a few days in, I hit my breaking point; thankfully one of my siblings came and got me a hotel room so I could sleep and shower for a couple nights... but coming back home, everything really piled up again. We also had family visit a week after we got back, so everything kinda had to be thrown into my room because there was nowhere else to put it.

Within 3 weeks since the initial emergency, there were about 4-6 nights where I had less than an hour of sleep, and there were several days that I slept for 12+hrs, and then my sleep cycle switched to sleeping during the day, awake at night making sure my mom was breathing. Thankfully, my mom is now getting at-home care, so I've been feeling my anxiety go down a bit in that area. I was able to get my sleep back to normal earlier this week, so I'm sleeping through the night now instead of sleeping during the day or waking up after a short time feeling like I was having a panic attack. My eating has also been super irregular these last few weeks, but I'm trying to get that back on track, and actually eat meals, so I finally went grocery shopping on Tuesday, after putting it off for weeks.

But here is where I'm at with my room. And with everything I've learned in the last few weeks, it doesn't really matter if people are telling me to put myself first so I can handle things better... it's that I don't even know how to do that. It does not come natural to me because it's been like this my whole life. Any period of time that I'm not depressed is spent recovering from the last episode. Every time I'm not experiencing a ton of fibro pain, I'm doing as much as I can to catch up on everything I fell behind on. But there is no balance. I haven't been outside of survival mode since... probably ever. I really cannot think of a time. I am really grateful for what I have but I don't feel I've made much progress as an adult and I spend a lot of time worrying what my life is going to be like if I don't change anything.

I want to move out and find my own place in the world, but I need a job in order to do that, and my room isn't enabling me to do that. Ideally, I'd be working from home (in my room) or doing something I can do from a coffee shop, or be able to visit friends and not have to miss getting paid. Maybe I can have a savings? Maybe I could retire one day..? Maybe I could send my son to college..?

I feel like I should be so excited at the idea of making money and getting out of here, but I'm dealing with some serious mental blocks that are keeping my space like this. Almost like it feels safe being the way it is? Like I'm borrowed in here. Like, it's safe for me if nothing changes.  Meanwhile, all day long, it occupies my mind how badly I need to figure it out.

In the last week, I've gotten some laundry done... haven't folded it yet. I got my dishes out of here. I also pulled out a bag of old meds and empty pill bottles so I could remove the labels and throw them away. This seems like something that could've waited, but it was taking up space in my closet for 2 years, which took up a lot of mental space, telling myself I'd get to it later, again and again and again. So that space is free now, and I do see how that's put me a smidge closer to being done.

I wanted to get this done this week so I could rearrange my furniture and set up more storage that's just kinda waiting for me to make space for it, and I told myself everything else in the house could wait, but here we are on Thursday, and I don't see any visible progress other than a garbage bag that got bigger. I'm picking up my son in abt 10 days and I still need time to finish cleaning/organizing projects elsewhere in the house. And rest.

I woke up at 7:30 today, made myself breakfast, went to physical therapy, and I've been plooped in my bed since. I'm about to make something to eat, then I have therapy over zoom (she helps me with lots of things, but also exposure therapy, including for my room), and then I'll be freed up to work on my room.

At the moment, it doesn't feel like it's going to get done. I know it needs to. I know I need to get back to finding a job. I know I need to get out of here. I know I need to make a better life for myself. But I look around and I have no idea where to start. Where do I put things I don't know where to put? How much space do I need when similar things get stored together? I'll make lists to put it in a certain order so I can follow the steps, but it's the ""doing"" part that I'm getting stuck on. The ""Freeze"" in Fight, Flight, or Freeze is so very real.

Any words of encouragement are so welcome. I love this sub and I love seeing when people post their progress and before/afters, and I look forward to updating with my own. Sorry for the novel.

- **Average Realized Gold Price:** $3,320/oz, up $376/oz from Q1, reflecting favorable market conditions and pricing strategies.
- **Gold Co-Product All-In Sustaining Cost (AISC):** $1,593/oz, down 4% from Q1, driven by lower sustaining capital and cost discipline.

## Shareholder Returns and Capital Management

- **Share Repurchase Authorization:** New $3.0 billion program, with flexibility and no expiration.

## ESG and Reclamation

- **Sustainability Reporting:** Transparent disclosure of environmental and economic contributions.

## Industry and Macro Commentary
- **Gold Market:** Newmont’s realized gold price surged to $3,320/oz, reflecting strong global demand and favorable commodity pricing.
- **Economic Uncertainty:** The company’s low leverage and high liquidity provide resilience against macroeconomic volatility, tariffs, and regulatory changes.
- **Government Efficiency:** No material impact from government efficiency initiatives or tariffs reported in the quarter.

## Conclusion
Newmont’s Q2 2025 results underscore its operational excellence, financial strength, and commitment to shareholder value. With record free cash flow, robust capital returns, and a fortified balance sheet, Newmont is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on gold market tailwinds and deliver sustainable value.
