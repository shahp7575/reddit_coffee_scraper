I2C HID compliant touchpad

i’m for the most part able to boot up and use  macOS Ventura (13.7.2), except my trackpad is only recognized as a mouse and recognizes no gestures at all, not even 2 finger scrolling.

i’ve spent hours trying countless fixes to get this to work, including:

Deleting the mouse plugin from VoodooPS2Controller(this resulted in no function from the the trackpad at all)


Trying different touchpad kexts (this didn’t do much of anything. I do notice that during boot up, it seems that VoodooI2CHID refuses to load, stating “invalid parameter” but i couldn’t find anywhere that gave advice for this that wasn’t something i already tried)

I read that the XOSI ssdt is supposed to be a fix for this, but i did that as part of my initial open core usb setup, and it doesn’t seem to work on my system 



kinda lost on what to do here since every method i see listed seems to just not work on my hardware, and I feel like there has to be something super obvious that i’m missing 

the closest i’ve come to a fix is this post(https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/19880-solved-latitude-3310-coffee-lake-trackpad-gestures-not-working/) on a forum, where someone with the exact same laptop, and same problem as me apparently got it working…

(My post was taken down for self-promotion on another Subreddit.) I went here for a coffee meeting earlier and noticed it is very new and offset from the Highway, so I wanted to be sure to share this new hidden gem! 

I asked if they had anything I could share here to get the word out and they provided me a flyer - seems the flyer gives 20% off if you show them it so here it is. 

  
I am told it is locally owned and operated and the coffee is cheaper then the large chains and the atmosphere is beautiful as it is on Los Patios so it is a quiet place for coffee meetings like I had earlier.  Nothing too fancy but it does have all the great standards.  Cute place and I was told they will turn on the fireplace when the weather calls for it. (Date spot??) 

Los Patios has been around for a good long while in this town and it is good to see new things opening up here, they also have a Saladworks on Los Patios now which I will have to go back and try sometime.

I'm 28 (F) and work 6 days a week. I love my life. I am highly into self-care and quiet time, walking my dog, coffee on my day off after I've run errands, I work on projects like my writing and just love being by myself. I always have something to do. I've always been this way from a young age, I get unwell around loudness/social events and generally value alone time.

I've gone estranged from extended family for 3 years now, it was the best decision of my life. I feel unwell around them, I get headaches and I can't function at work if I've attended their shindig. They don't approve of my lifestyle (the not visiting, ""making effort"", my partner being a different background, being too health conscious when it comes to my diet, etc. They are religious fanatics who have nothing interesting to contribute and there are a few creepy uncles who stare at my chest). I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND THEM. I'm never myself if that makes sense and just cannot be there. It's horrible. I don't want them in my life. My Sunday is gone, they expect me to be at theirs when I have days off, birthdays, etc. It's not how I want to spend my life (cries)

The way I see it, you hardly get enough time to yourself in life after work is done, so why spend it in a way you don't want to?

Now I'm getting stick off my dad about not visiting my gran over christmas. Not really stick but he says everyone is worried about me and confused by my distant behaviour, but to go ahead and be happy and he will support me (I visit him a few times a year with my partner for a meal). I just want my Sundays off to myself to live my life. I am so exhausted all the time. Am I right to not explain myself to these extended family members?

First time kitten parents terrorised by evil kitten!,"My boyfriend and I got a kitten together a few months ago and she is about 5 months old now. We love her to death but we’ve been having some issues with her and would love some advice.

I’ve had 2 cats in the past who were perfectly tempered and the sweetest little cuddle bugs but I adopted them when they were both already older. 

Shes often pretty aggressive and she likes to jump from the floor directly onto my face and claw her way up my body biting and scratching me in the process. Not sure if this is aggression or just play as she usually does this as a greeting.

She is obsessed with drinking out of our cups even though she has 3 water bowls around the apartment. She will drink out of our water, coffee, and tea, and no matter how we stop her or redirect her she will not stop desperately trying to get back to the cup until it is empty.

Every time she comes to cuddle or receive affection she zones out and starts suckling on our hands, chins, or cheeks. The suckling is like a baby suckling but it’s also accompanied by light biting that becomes painful over time as she will zone out and do this until she falls asleep. 

She seems to really hate noise and will pounce on me, bite my face, claw me, and keep coming back and trying from different angles if I push her off. She does this if I jokingly speak in a higher pitch to my boyfriend, if I whine about something, if I cry, or if I raise my voice in the slightest. 

Some additional info: She has a cat tree, countless toys and enrichment items, food she likes, treats, catnip, chewing sticks, constant attention, walks in the park, a fancy water fountain, and lots of comfy areas to sleep.

She’s a tuxedo by the way.

I just had my interview 2 days ago, and it seemed to go pretty well! I had arrived early and the baristas were friendly (I got free coffee!) The manager was chill as well.

Now as for the questions, I was asked:

• A time when I have inspired others
• A time when I had an issue that I had to overcome
• A time I've received good customer service
• How many hours a week I can work/availability (30 hours + open availability)
• When I am available to start working

We ended the interview on a good note and was told that I'd get a response by Friday (or before Friday?) 

Now what I'm worried about is whether or not I'll get the job since I wasn't hired on the spot like plenty of people who've interviewed with Starbucks did, and I also wasn't asked the key question of ""what to do when a customer is upset about their drink.""

for me... i thrive with a morning routine and am sooo much more able to reliably stick to my morning routine than evening. i have a 6 year old so im up early but also flexible with my mornings because they aren't just mine anymore. 

every morning (no matter what) before i do anything else i drink a whole mason jar of water. that and coffee are my constants. 
if i don't have my kiddo i love to go for a long solo morning run, stretch do some breathing and then go make a good brekkie for me and my partner. 

i think my sag moon and my 1st house stellium are what have me craving the solo physical time. running both gets me out of my head and also allows for creative thoughts to flow. i feel so much more able to handle my extreme feels/obsessive thoughts (scorp stellium) when i move my body and get alone time. 

nigh nigh routine is way harder for me these days. my kiddo and i have sweet rituals for his bed time but once he's asleep im sooo zonked and lucky if i brush my teeth before i fall asleep

I am in the process of divorce, nothing bad on either end, we just grew apart, and looking to make new friends.  After 13 years all friends tend to be mutual so it would be nice to meet people outside of that circle. I am educated with a HBSc from McMaster University and would love to have someone to chat with through the day, bitch about work, share memes with and just generally interact.

Other things about me.  No kids (I’ve never disliked a woman enough to make her raise any spawn of mine), I am pretty funny (my mom says so), attractive (see above mom opinion), dedicated dog dad, well read, history nerd, a Buffy the Vampire Slayer and West Wing fan and I guess Liberal politically with woke reservations.  I drink my coffee black and my whisky neat.  I love great books and movies, sports, 90's music and people who aren't afraid to speak their mind. 

Sexually I am a natural Dom with a lot of experience so if that lifestyle intrigues you feel free to ask.  I don’t think I am ready to meet anyone in person but I am open to it if things click and we seem like a good match.  Hope to hear back!

1hhcqi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1hhcqi8/a_forgotten_curio_shop/,A Forgotten Curio Shop,"There are forgotten places in every city.  
They decay quietly, buried beneath newer buildings. Layers of less-forgotten places pile up on top of them, like the striations in some prehistoric canyon. But the colours of this history are not limestone white and clay orange; these are concrete grey, and the rich browns of old wood.  
A few of these abandoned places can still be found, by the tenacious and the lost. They wait patiently behind swollen doorways and down ill-used stairs, littered with middens of brittle rat droppings. Some can’t be accessed at all. The eyes of their windows gaze only into dirt and darkness, and once-bright paint trembles to dust as trucks and cars rumble overhead. Modern vibrations quickly hasten the entropy of years.  
Some suffocate, when an earthquake cracks the last support shoring up a mouldering mausoleum. Concrete and dirt thunders in, eager to fill the dusty void and mill the antique carpentry to splinters. Others drown, when a water main develops a leak, filling the underground void with water one slow drip at a time. All things inside swell and rot, their sodden fibres becoming a uniform grey slurry at the bottom of a secret urban lake.  
But some places survive. Although they are mostly forgotten, the meticulous care with which they were built ensures that they persist. Or perhaps they are loaned an enduring spirit by their purpose, or what they contained.  
Once in a while, someone will stumble across one of those places, without having any idea what it is.  
This is a story about such a place.

   
Some cities should never have been built.  
The place where I live is a case study. The original tiny settlement, built in a hill-bound harbour, expanded too fast with the influx of population in its infancy. Like many overfed toddlers, it grew into a fat, sprawling adult. The messy metropolis drapes itself over the steep hills, demanding and devouring more inhospitable land every year. Consequently, roads are too narrow, houses the same; their piles and supports exposed and raw from erosion as constant sea-storms batter the soil into salty mud. Having lived here all my life, this seemed perfectly normal until I chanced to visit a land-bound city, all flat and geometric; the streets straighter than arrows, neatly laid out like the grids in a mathematics book.  
To outsiders, my city seems needlessly convoluted, with streets stacked above one another, hidden tunnels and scribbly wooden bridges connecting otherwise disparate terraces together. The harbourside central city is even worse. Hundreds of years of accumulated architecture have been colonised by newly-minted towers of glass and steel, like so many modern parasites.  
It’s the sort of place where anyone can get lost. Even people who are born here can’t resist the occasional wrong turn, just to see where that weird little road they’ve never been down might lead them. I did that a lot, walking in no particular direction through the twisting, mazy streets just to see where I would end up. And that’s precisely how I managed to stumble upon the curio shop.  
I’d seen the entrance many times, but I’d never felt the urge to explore. It was a brick-arched alley, narrow and dingy, with no signage, and no indication that anything interesting lay within. I don’t know why that familiar arch piqued my curiosity on that particular day. But I found myself walking beneath it, navigating the cracked paving stones of an alley that curled between buildings and ended in a flight of graffitied concrete stairs. They lead up and down, both directions littered with faded city garbage.  
Down the stairs I found nothing but a cave-in of rubble and scum-covered water. But upwards, the steps opened onto *another* brick alley, carpeted with grey-green lichens and spongy boluses of moss.  
My shoes were sodden when I found the ancient arcade at the very end.  
It must have been glorious, once upon a time. A not-quite-Victorian wonder of leadlights and timber, diamond panes of red and yellow glass were interspersed with wrought iron and glazed tiles. But now the tiles were cracked and broken, the clever mosaics smashed beyond recognition. The glass was equal parts whole and shattered, mould-rimed fragments of it crunching beneath my feet.  
It was a sort of mezzanine arcade, clearly built to show off a lower level, which must have been a pretty space, centred around a painted fountain and an indoor garden. No water gushed from the flaking stone snouts of the bottlenosed dolphins in the centre of the water feature now, and the thick sludge accumulated in the basin below them barely counted as water, grown green with algae.  
Somewhere in the overgrown moistness of ferns and grass around the fountain, a frog registered its displeasure at my echoing footsteps, then fell silent.  
Most of the shops were empty or boarded up. One was piled to the roof with broken furniture; sagging upholstery long succumbed to fungus and time, strips of haberdashery hanging like flayed flesh from wooden bones.  
But at the end of the arcade stood a single, impossible, pristine store, its stained glass intact and the wood shining with linseed. Yellow and orange light gloamed in windows stacked with an assortment of useful and unnameable junk. Some of the items looked like they pre-dated my grandparents.  
Above the door, in a curling font so old I’d never seen anything like it before, was painted “A Forgotten Curio Shop”.  
Was this all some sort of elaborate, theatrical setup for a boutique so hipster no-one was supposed to know where it was? I wasn’t sure, but certainly, this place wasn’t easy to find, and business must not be very good. Then again, I didn’t imagine the rent was very high – if the shop owner paid rent at all – so perhaps that was how this strange little shop stayed afloat.  
A brass bell tinkled as I opened the door, the bright sound charmingly anachronistic. I glanced up at it; one side of the tiny instrument was badly dented, as if it had survived many, many years of use. If this was a hipster setup, the attention to detail was astonishing. Beyond ranks of shelves cluttered with old flotsam was a mullioned counter, and behind it sat a middle-aged woman. She was smartly dressed, but her garments belonged to another era. A peacock feather tucked into the crinoline brim of her hat bobbed jauntily as she inclined her head toward the sound of the bell.  
“Welcome,” she called, a smile claiming her face with lightswitch alacrity, “to a forgotten curio shop.”  
The shop wasn’t big, but every nook was densely packed. There were so many things crowded cheek-by-jowl I could barely register what they all were, even when I did recognise them. Some of them were familiar from history books, some from illustrated fairytales; iron heating pans for beds, different styles of Indian hookahs, and an impressive array of enamelled snuff-boxes, rich with cloisonné. The glass-bead eyes of taxidermied animals regarded me, frozen snarls on rictus faces leering through piles of old books and brass pots. I breathed musty sourness, faded perfumes, and the tang of old metal.  
“Can I help you with anything?” the woman chirruped brightly. Her accent was pleasantly transatlantic, like an old movie or radio star’s. I wondered how long she’d spent practising it.  
“Just looking, thanks,” I replied automatically, my gaze roving over various oddments.  
“That’s an Inverness cape, you know. Real bargain for ten pound,” she chattered, as my fingers brushed sable fabric, “belonged to a murdered banker.” Her eyes were slightly too small, and far too bright for the topic. “Wife did him in with a flatiron, which is over in the houseware section – still got the bloodstains on it and all.”  
“You’re pulling my leg,” I shot back, squeezing between shelves of apoplectic looking porcelain animals and painted pewter mugs.  
“Oh, I could be,” she gave me a gummy grin, then winked like a music-hall bawdy. “Or perhaps everything here really *does* have a story behind it, and you just need to suspend disbelief a little to see it.”  
So that was what this place was all about. The whole setup was carefully curated chicanery, to make you feel like you’d found something special, that you’d stumbled upon a nearly mystical place forgotten by time. Now I’d figured out the mystery, the shop seemed tawdry and overdone, the stacks of old things hackneyed and silly – just piles of junk with exorbitant price tags.  
And yet, I still wanted something from the shop. Whenever I went on my random excursions through the city, I liked to collect little keepsakes. Sometimes it was the skeleton of a leaf from an overgrown cemetery, other times it was a pleasingly smooth pebble, or an oddly shaped fragment of driftwood, wearing the contours of a tiny dragon’s skull.  
Some tarnished jewellery hung from the antlers of a stag, each piece carefully hooked over the spreading tines. None of the earrings matched; each had lost a twin somewhere in its journey through people’s lives, and I felt an odd pang of sadness for these old things. Not only had each lost its mate, but they had been abandoned by those who had once cherished them.  
From the crown tine dangled a pearl earring, its silver chasing and hook wire almost black with age and neglect. It was quite large; far larger than a conventional pearl, and warped, its shape more lozenge than sphere. On closer inspection, I could see the crack that ran from the base to the top, a zig-zag hairline of black that seemed a testament to how unloved it had become.  
But the tiny paper tag tied to it said that it was only two pound, so I lifted it off the antlers and took it to the counter, the mother-of-pearl warm in my palm.  
“What’s the story behind this one, then?” I asked casually, careful not to let my jaded thoughts colour my voice.  
“Oh, this is a pretty one,” the woman cooed, reaching under the counter for some rose-tinted tissue paper, “it belonged to a courtesan who frequented the palaces of King George the Third. Whilst she was not as lovely as her peers, her charm and wit were without parallel. Thus, she swindled the fortunes out of dozens of noblemen.”  
“I like her already,” I replied, smiling despite myself. The keen eyes of the proprietress held mine for a moment.  
“I think it’s entirely mutual – that’s why her earring chose you.”  
Pleasant tingles crawled across my scalp as I watched the woman’s deft hands wrap the object, then place it in a tiny box.  
“Here you go, miss. That’ll be two pound.”  
Strangely thrilled by the whole experience, I handed over a fiver and told her to keep the change. As I left the shop, my fingers wiggled an uncharacteristic little wave, and I heard myself promise the woman that I’d visit again sometime soon.

   
The earring matched none of the jewellery I owned, so instead of hooking it through my ear, I twisted the silver wire around a necklace chain and let it hang as a pendant. Although I didn’t believe the stories of the curio shop’s owner, my mind wandered in those spare moments between work and responsibility, imagining the remarkable woman my new bauble purportedly belonged to.  
In my mind’s eye, she was a short thing, with hips wide enough to be embarrassing, and a pot belly squashed flat by layers of clever corsetry. Just as the saleswoman had said, she wasn’t beautiful in the slightest, possessing none of the aesthetic qualities our modern sensibilities would deem ‘conventionally attractive’. But her face was animated, cheerful, and stamped with a lively wit that could be read in every tilt of her too-plump lips and every quirk of her thick eyebrows. I envisaged her talking to rich men sporting elaborate, pre-Victorian costumes, her kohl-lined, liquid-brown eyes pulling them under her spell like the *Rusalka* of Slavic folklore.  
As I went about my day-to-day business, I let her imagined presence whisper through my thoughts, and I began to play a game with myself, where I would try to react and respond to people as though I were the mysterious courtier.  
To my surprise, I was actually quite good at playing the part.  
Oh, I didn’t entrap men and take their money like she had – of course I didn’t! But as I grew enamoured with the role I was playing, as her honey words drizzled from my lips more and more often, I found myself the object of a *lot* of male attention. After I took home the third suitor in as many days, after we made love like frenzied teenagers, I started to wonder about my sudden change of romantic fortune.  
Was the earring to blame, or was this all just me?  
Whatever the case, it was time to pay another visit to the curio shop.

   
I was almost surprised that it was still in the same dilapidated arcade, that the homely golden glow of light still spilled from those cluttered display windows. I think I had almost expected it to have disappeared, or that I had imagined the whole thing, and I would be met with nothing but a dark, smelly alley. Smiling to myself at the lively tinkle of the brass bell, I entered the shop and greeted the proprietor with all the newfound warmth of my adopted persona.  
“You’re enjoying it, then?” she asked, nodding at the pearl around my neck.  
I had the good grace to blush, caught out in my self-indulgent roleplay.  
“It’s fine, love,” she assured me, “they all like to come out and play, those that owned them. It’s naught to be ashamed of.”  
I wanted to ask her if it was real, if some fragment of the souls of the owners truly persisted in their lost possessions – or if this was all part of her shtick; the mysterious forgotten curio shop that sold nearly magical items. But I couldn’t find the words, even with my new gift of the gab. Trying not to embarrass myself further, I held my tongue and quietly browsed the overstacked shelves for a while.  
“May I ask what this is?” I hesitated, then continued, “and to whom did it belong?”  
“Ah,” replied the woman, “that, my dear, is a silver chafing dish, formerly owned by one of the finest cooks in London. Even during the leanest of times, she always served marvellous meals in it, notably filled with the most succulent meats.”  
As her artfully-accented words washed over me, I felt those same pleasant tingles creep from the nape of my neck to the top of my head, where they spread and danced like warming, pretty wildfire.  
“I’ll take it,” I told her, lifting it carefully from where it rested atop a teetering pile of junk.  
“You haven’t even looked at the price, love.”  
I that instant I was all courtesan, confident and charming,  
“There is no need to, madame! This object was meant to be with me.”  
Saying nothing, she wrapped the tarnished dish in that same rose-tinted tissue, her efficient hands and the whispery crumple of paper amplifying that orgasmic feeling radiating from my scalp.  
I don’t even remember what I paid for it. I barely recall leaving the arcade, the brown paper bag clutched to my chest like a precious child.

   
Even though the dish stood crooked, one leg shorter than the others, everything I made in it tasted *divine*. If I broiled even plain carrots in its inner dish, they melted in the mouth, their sweetness and most pleasant flavour notes amplified to the perfect culinary pitch. The cook herself lingered in my mind, her massive, homely presence hovering behind me as I salted and spiced different dishes. Disapproving frowns let me know that I shouldn’t use this or that ingredient, and silent laughs that set her impressive jowls wobbling told me when I was on the right track.  
The first party at my house was a roaring success. Between the fantastic food and my newfound socialite graces, the last guests didn’t leave until well after midnight, asking when I would host again – and could they get the recipe for that incredible salmon soufflé?  
But after a few weeks of constant parties, each culminating in all-night fucking with the most eligible male (and sometimes female) guests, I was utterly *exhausted*.  
Yet I wasn’t ready to let it go, and neither were my two skullmates, the Courtesan and the Cook. I just needed something to pick me up, to give me the pep and stamina of a twenty-year-old athlete, instead of the chubby, thirty-something office-worker I really was.  
I barely remember making the journey to the curio shop, nor did I register the jolly tinkle of the bell on the door this time. I must have looked haggard, even though I was dressed as smartly as I’d ever been. My thoughts rose sluggishly through a murky haze of fatigue, always a step behind events as they transpired.  
“You look like you need a little vim and vigour in your life,” chattered the canny proprietress, taking me by the hand and leading me to a corner of the shop I’d yet to browse, “let’s see what we can do for you.”  
In this nook, all manner of men’s accoutrements were gathered and displayed; from stained silk bowties to antique gorgets on brass chains greened with verdigris. My tired eyes roved over the assortment, not quite processing why I was here and what I could possibly want with such masculine objects.  
“I think you’ll like this one, my lovely,” crooned the owner, the delicious lilt of her voice melting through my head like a warm hit of heroin.  
“Yes, I think I will,” I replied, as she closed my shaking hands around a silver letter opener much the worse for wear, its point snapped off and the nacre handle cracked in two places.  
“He was a famous pugilist, the fellow who owned it,” she explained, leading me to the counter, “a bare-knuckle champion who fought round after round without tiring. He never lost a bout.”  
I already knew that, because he was already there, watching money change hands – far too much money for a useless old letter opener. He was a massive, ropy bear of a fellow, nose so broken it was nearly flat. Yet his curling, waxed moustache was pert and jaunty, at odds with his otherwise thuggish appearance.  
As I left the shop, I could almost feel those huge, sunken-knuckled hands kneading the fatigue and tension out of my shoulders. My step was already lighter and my spirit freshened by the time I reached the street.

   
He was always there, the massive boxer, his indomitable will propping up mine whenever I faltered. I kept the letter opener tucked into the top of my garter – the latter an affectation from the courtesan – and the cool silver pressed against my flesh was an energising balm.  
The trio of personalities worked perfectly together. Like a well-oiled engine crew servicing some elaborate, chattering machine from a previous era, each of them played a vital part in keeping it all running, leaving me with little to do but observe and enjoy. But such elaborate engagements didn’t come cheaply, and I wasn’t a wealthy woman. When my bank account was finally reduced to a string of zeroes, the courtesan shushed my panicked cries and had me lift my mattress. Beneath it was a thick layer of banknotes, the money she had been taking from all the eligible suitors – all willing gifts befitting a lady, she assured me. I didn’t question whether I believed her or not.  
Men no longer graced my bed, however, for the pugilist would have no truck with any of that. Women only, he insisted, and he came to dominate all bedroom activities, while I eagerly drank the oceans of pleasure he drenched me with. When the chokings and beatings started, I didn’t care; this was *his* time and he could do with it what he pleased. Besides, all the women consented to it, with the slippery words of the courtesan in their ears encouraging and cajoling them.  
Left free to roam my own thoughts, I found I could explore theirs, too. My brain felt like a boarding-house, each of them taking up residence in a particular room, filling those spaces with memories of times lost to history. I danced complicated pavanes in the court of King George, and I walked the streets of Victorian London, hawking pies of strange, tender meats. Best of all was reliving the glory days of the pugilist. I felt the fists of stevedores and sailors break upon my iron jaw, watched my own sledgehammer hands crush their noses and cheekbones, smelled the blood and sawdust, and heard the animal screams of the crowd.  
But I delved further than I should have.  
Murder was far easier in those times, before forensics and detectives. Nobody cared much if some villain’s daughter was found strangled in a ditch, or if some nobleman’s mistress and ill-gotten child perished from another mysterious form of consumption. The courtesan’s first poisoning had been the wife of a minor merchant, not an enemy, simply someone who was in the way of her plans. As the pages of her memories turned, they grew progressively blacker, whole chapters of callous murders no longer discriminating between women and children.  
They were all just obstacles between her and her burgeoning wealth.  
I fled then, into the warm, homely memories of the cook, redolent with the comforting aromas of fresh-baked bread and rich, spiced stews. She was a helper of women, this one. A feminist, well before such a word existed – her skills extending beyond the kitchen and into counselling and minor surgeries. Women knocked on her door during the darkest hours of night, their bellies swollen with illegitimate heirs; and she would take the shame out of them, allowing them to live a life free of the stigma of bastard babies.  
I watched her reverently carry the bloodied remains of a twenty-week foetus away from its exhausted mother, who lay blissfully asleep on a crimson-stained pallet in the cook’s scullery. I knew what she was about to do before it happened, and I pleaded with the woman’s memory not to do it; to change history, to leave it at the point where she had helped instead of committing the final depraved act in her arsenal.  
But the past cannot be changed. And so, into the dish the dead child went, the seething water parting London’s tenderest meat from friable, nascent bones – a skeleton that would never thrive and strengthen on its mother’s milk.  
I fled then, down the corridors of my mind, away from the twin evils I had so readily invited into me. I ran back toward my own memories, strangely distant, mothballed and dusty in the lower recesses of my head. The pugilist stopped me, his broad, tattooed chest filling the narrow passage and his jackhammer fist knocking me off my feet.  
He bore me over one mighty shoulder, into his own chamber of horrors, piled haphazardly with the bruise-necked corpses of girls and women.  
“You knew,” he rumbled, the resonance of his voice a vibration in my bowels, “you knew from the start I was a killer.”  
“No,” I wept, “No!”  
But that was a lie.

   
The curio shop seemed impossible to find this time, the curling, confusing streets of my city even more misleading than normal. As I walked, finding dead end after dead end, they fought for control of me, the trio in my head. The pugilist battered my synapses with his powerful knuckles, while the courtesan drizzled deception over my bruised brain, sticky and sweet as a Russian honey cake layered with lies.  
But the cook, for all her own evils, did not see herself as the others did. For her, there had been no complicit embrace of darkness; in her own mind, she was still protected by a purity of purpose. All along, she had only been helping other women to escape from the tyranny of the opposite sex. And if the hideous conclusion she had wrought from that brought some personal gain, well, that simply allowed her more resources to help her poor unfortunates.  
And so it was that she placed herself between my thoughts and theirs, her corpulent bulk absorbing the hammering blows of the fighter, and her cavernous mouth shouting down the lies.  
The entrance to the alley was suddenly *there*, a gaping brick void, and I ran down it before it could disappear. I ran up the graffitied stairs, through the second moss-carpeted alley, and stumbled out into the dimly lit arcade. The lambent glow of the curio shop window was as welcome as a candle in a moorland hut, guiding the lost traveller home.  
As the brass bell tinkled, the clamour in my head subsided, and all three intruders fell silent.  
“I don’t take back items,” the proprietress said, before I could speak. An unfamiliar hardness stiffened her voice. “But I can sell you another. Something which will help you control them.”  
“No! I’ll not buy any more of your cursed junk!”  
“Then enjoy what remains of your wretched new life,” she snarled, all her affability fled. “Best of luck staying their killer instincts.”  
Sapped of the pugilist’s indomitable energy, my knees and hands trembled, weak with exhaustion.  
“Perhaps they’ve killed here already,” her laugh was brittle as she pushed past the counter and waded through all the junk, “Or should I say, perhaps *you* have. How many strangled girls are hidden beneath your bed? How many wives have died of mysterious ailments after you’ve finished with their husbands?”  
She was close enough now that I could smell her breath, heavy with coffee and cinnamon, and something rank and old.  
*“How many babies have you boiled?”*  
Yanking the necklace off, I hurled it at her. It struck her cheek, then fell to the floor.  
“Oh no. You can’t get rid of them like that. Those people are part of you now.”  
The shop was spinning around me, leering animal heads, flashes of old brass, sparkling, smeared trails of coloured glass and shiny tat. I struggled to steady myself.  
“Then how? Just tell me how!”  
Reaching inside the front pocket of her neatly tailored dress, she pulled out a long silver chain, from which dangled a set of well-polished keys.  
“The shop is for sale. Should you wish to buy it.”  
I stared at her, dizzy, not comprehending, as she jingled the keys, the sound uncannily similar to the pretty chime of the bell.  
“And the owner of the shop cannot be controlled by the objects.”  
I licked my dry lips. With the familiar eloquence of the courtesan lost, my voice sounded wobbly and pathetic,  
“What… what will it cost me?”  
“Everything. Everything that is yours.”

   
She walked out of the shop, wearing my clothes, my face and my flesh. She was awkward in them still; but everything that had been mine – everything that had been *me*, from the birthmark on my wrist to the memories of my fifth birthday – was now hers.  
She would adjust quickly – and I knew she would thrive; finally freed from her imprisonment.  
And in turn, everything that was hers is now mine.  
There are *thousands* of items in the shop; and as my old memories fade and wither, hers continue to blossom, spooling their secrets and stories into me. Thus, I have embraced my role, or it has embraced me, as the new owner of this place, this forgotten curio shop. And I’m destined to remain here until some poor sap chances upon the brick archway, and is finally ensnared.  
Knowing the truth of it all, I’ve given you the choice that I did not have. Knowledge is supposedly powerful. And perhaps you have the strength of will that I didn’t. Perhaps you’ll stop at one object, and never buy a second. Perhaps you’ll even have the fortitude to endure two?  
Whatever the case, you know the dangers.  
But if you *do* decide to buy something, if the objects choose you, then I’m here. I’ll be more than happy to help, if you’re the right person to find me.

1hhcpym,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hhcpym,Finch hacks for auDHD!,"I can't tell you how helpful Finch has been. I am auDHD and I have my own business, have to manage gigs and my interests and training. I've a lot on my plate. My attention span has been quite bad lately (like 3s) and Finch has single handedly helped me clean up my life so I thought I would pay it forward and share some hacks I've found that work for me!

1) the moment I think of a task, I write it down
My memory is really bad as mentioned, and it helps that I can also put the task in a future date.  I also attach tasks to focus timers and reflections, depending on what's needed. 

2) I categorize tasks by time and journey so I've a morning and evening routine. And I make many journeys. They gave silly names as listed. ""Flesh Bag Maintenance"" is brushing my hair, taking a shower etc. ""Autism sensory kit"" is activities to help me sensory soothe etc.  the silly names make me smile every time I log a task and it appeals to my autistic need to organize everything (but this desire gets destroyed by ADHD chaos this making me feel dysregulated a lot). 

Obvious, but this has changed my life. I now finish all my physio exercises and all my morning tasks within an hour. It used to take hours!

3) I use Finch to track my hypermobility symptoms, my snake trainings, my mushroom growing project, etc 
I put a task ""elbow hypermobility check in"" etc and I write down what my triggers are or if I had a good day. This is super helpful for noticing trends! I also have pet snakes and I use Finch to record how they do with their target training and choice based handling. 

4) I use Finch to record triggers so I see trends 
I've PTSD and I use tags to log in when I'm triggered so I can go back and observe how I deal with them.

5) Finch for mindfulness
I often get frustrated and overwhelmed and it's not always rational. I also have alexithymia so I don't recognize feelings easily. I try to always journal why I feel a certain way, and over time I noticed trends and in able to observe feelings with more neutrality. 

6) Finch for avoiding tasks
Because I've ADHD, I find small tasks sometimes insurmountable. I've found Finch has been the only thing helping me. I break tasks down into every small step but I also snooze a task and reflect on why. I schedule it for a future date and I use the timer to spend ten minutes at a time trying to do it. I also use the task of the day when I'm struggling with a particular task.

7) the timers are everything!!!!
I use the timers for everything, even making coffee, putting on clothes, daily tasks I struggle with. For bigger tasks, I use it as a way to start a task. It doesn't matter if I don't finish it. I realize my issue is starting and the ten minute timer is life. 

8) I've a journey to reward my adherence to Finch
I've a task where I give myself 50x if I'm low on spoons, and another 100x if I finished all my tasks the day before. If I skip the spoons, I'll explain why I felt ok and didn't need the extra encouragement. 

9) I reflect on everything!
Am I struggling to brush my hair? I reflect on why I want to skip it. I noticed that just having it there makes me prefer to do the task than skip the task, as my autistic need for perfection gets annoyed!

10) I use Finch to satisfy my retail ADHD cravings 
I am obsessed with the clothing in Finch. Like very obsessed. I will sometimes tell myself I can't buy a certain piece of clothing till I finish the task of the day. It kinda works!

I also dress my Finch based on what I've to do sometimes and I like dressing my Finch for bed!

11) I use Finch to help me develop more enriching hobbies 
I have so many things I want to try and no brain space to do it. I put small tasks to look up an activity's first step. This is how I ended up growing mushrooms and my next thing is trying embrodiery!

I use Finch in many other ways, and I've only been using it for a month so far but it's changed my life. I'm curious if you guys have anything to add. I hope you found this post useful!!! I've attached a pic of my Finch with a plushie someone lovely here gifted me 💖😍",6,1734558431.0,finch,0,1.0,False
1hhcpty,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1hhcpty/my_coffee_shop_business_is_in_trouble/,My coffee shop business is in trouble #coffeebusiness ,"Hey there! I am looking for legal counsel or someone that just knows some basic business stuff. 

I opened a coffee shop in September 2024 and it's been going with a BANG. It's done amazing. Well, there is a lady in my community that owns an Herbalife shop. She asked me to sell her protein coffee powder drink and I politely declined but thanked her for asking. 

2 weeks later I get something on the mail saying I had been reported to the health dept and had to submit things for approval and have someone come look at us cause we were reported... that's fine and whatever cause I want to make sure things are good! 

Here's the part that upsets me. I never told anyone that she tried selling me her product and I declined. I had SEVERAL people tell me that they heard she reported me because I didn't want to sell her Herbalife product. I'm not the only business she has done this to. 4 other businesses in my town have been reported and these owners have all talked and looks like we all have declined selling her product. 

Is there anything I can do to keep her away from my business? Is there such thing as a restraining order for businesses? She is looking to tear our hard earned business down and I don't want her anywhere near it. 

We took a pause on the business and trying to figure out what to do cause we feel targeted. 


Any and all advice would be appreciated. We aren't brick and mortar we do catering and deliveries. ",3,1734558423.0,coffee_roasters,6,0.71,False

I know a lot of this will be things to discuss with my GI, but wanting to know what others have given up because of this, or how you manage. 

I'm a big bourbon fan. Would have a pour (2oz) 3-4 nights a week sometimes. Glass of wine or two on occasion with dinner. Always had my coffee in the morning. Have the rare cigar, maybe 6 - 8 a year. 

I know hydration and diet are important. Prior to my flare-up I hadn't had bourbon for a couple weeks, just because. I've had a couple beers since getting better without issues. Tried coffee once too soon. Still haven't tried again. Really offost caffeine at this point. 

Wondering as we get into the holidays, since I won't see my GI Doc before, what I might partake of. And also, maybe what the future might hold. ",3,1734558236.0,Diverticulitis,2,1.0,False
1hhcmtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1hhcmtf/the_woods_in_the_east_are_rotten_and_evil/,The woods in the east are rotten and evil ,"My mother would sit in between my grandmother and I, and I would lay my head down across them so that it fell just between their legs. Then both of them would pet my hair and my back, and I would stare at the cinderblock-shaped TV with its curved fuzzy screen and feel the warmth and static that got soaked up off it’s pictures into the air and feel the long nails and wedding bands on my mom and Grandma’s hands and I would fall asleep. I’d wake up back home the next morning under a comforter with monkeys and palmtrees on it and I’d try to remember the car ride home, grateful that I got to skip feeling that terror in my stomach that took over each time we drove down a backroad at night. And stuck in between a couple of my back teeth I’d get a small crumb of brownie, and I would wrap myself in my monkey-covered comforter and squeeze my eyes shut with force and feel loved, truly, in a way I’ve held on to for the rest of my life’s 

She had used to have a husband, so I used to have a grandfather, but never when I knew her. “He was beautiful,” she’d say about him and she would smile and it was clear she missed him everyday. She lived alone in a house in a random patch of low-slung hills in the east, surrounded by forests that I loved in the day time but that always made me want to cry when I looked at them for  too long at night . Moonlight threw evil onto the woods, turning everything into Hardwood trees with razorsharp bark and swollen herds of uneaten deer, who’s white-tails are clouded grey like cataracts  and who’s antlers get scraped and bloody-fleshlike on the oaks and hickories, leaving red dried to brown stains thrown about like snot stains. Dotted throughout there were warped, stunted Chestnuts rotting into a syrupy-orange nothingness, which grandma said used to be as tall as skyscrapers when her own mother was born but now were born into rot, the air now poisoned by a fungus from China that’d waste them into nothing before they could drop a single fruit.

Still, I loved to visit her. Because in the day, I remember it as eden, smelling like dirt in the best way.. Just across the gravelly road from her little red house there was a marshland where rain water collected itself to feed some fat cattails, and when I was smaller it felt like a place you could disappear. The water was black and brown and oily and lumpy and misshapen from the clumps of translucent frog eggs that would appear early in the spring. When the sunlight stuck them right the black holes in the center of the frogspawn would light up and it would look like a million eyes fused together into a single monstrous tumor, staring up at me from a shallow puddle that felt like it went to the center of the earth. 
Beyond the little marsh was the hillside, mostly forest but with a little prairie cut into it to make room for the gargantuan power lines, standing proud with their eight arms paralyzed beside them, marching in a straight line over the hills and onto the next and over those and on to the next all the way to the Pacific Ocean. One day in February, I walked up the hill and sat beneath them, waiting for the too-near too-heavy greyed clouds in the sky to let the snow I thought they must have fall loose over the valley. I wore my dead grandpa’s gloves and jacket and my own hat and boots, and I sat criss-cross applesauce on the frozen cardboard-colored grass, and I listened to the crackles and shocks that peeled off the massive coils above me and somehow fell apart into the cold air before the reached the ground. Somewhere in the distance, I could hear the engine of a car, too commonplace for me to pick it out and label it inside my head.  I imagined how the thunderous footsteps of the sleeping sentinel would sound, how it would hit the earth with such force that even the electricity would give it a breath of peace after wards, buffeted away like the dirt of a creekbed tossed up by my feet when I waded in the summertime and hoped to see salamanders. 
Bright little snowflakes began to fall, too light to sink straight to the ground, and I stared at how white they were against the elephant-skin clouds. I noticed then that the car I had heard earlier had grown closer, and had in fact stopped beside my little marshland and rolled it’s windows down. Through the electrical fields and the rustling yellowed grass I could hear the man inside calling towards me, his voice getting a little louder each time I pretended not to hear. I stared up at the coils and wished he’d go away but my eyes couldn’t stop glancing at him to see if he was still there. Each time I’d curse at myself and my coward’s eyes, my rabbit-like bitch eyes that couldn’t stay still. The man’s voice was getting angrier and I was trying to be smaller. Finally I heard the car door slamming and footsteps set toward me, louder than the power tower’s steps in my head, louder than anything I’d ever heard. I locked my neck starring up and froze my body while I heard my heart beat start to drown things out a little more than it had before. 

“You the one who’s been driving on my drive way?” 

“Oh, I can’t drive,” I said back. “I’m 12.” 

The man was tall (like all men to a child) and wore reflective sunglasses and blue jeans and a brown jacket. On his hip he had a gun. He had stubble and teeth so yellow they were almost brown. His face seemed to cave in on itself and his jaw was crooked, so his mouth never totally closed and his heavy breath filled up the air between us. He lurched a bit and his voice was raw from screaming at me moments before. His hands were pale and covered in birth marks and protruding veins, and on his finger there was a wedding band he clearly hadn’t taken off in years and probably couldn’t anymore. 

“Someone’s been driving down into my drive way and driving fast in circles and messing up the gravel. I paid for that gravel myself.” 

“I’m sorry, I can’t drive. It wasn’t me.” 

He stared at me and I stared at myself in his sunglasses. There was snow in his throat, I could hear it. 

“What are you doing here? Do you live on this road? This is a private road.” 

“I stay with my grandma sometimes.” I pointed at her house. A dog began to bark from the man’s car. He stared at me again, letting his dog tire himself out as he caught his breath, the screaming catching up with his lungs as his adrenaline faded away.

“You never fucking ignore me again. Never in your fucking life. Okay?”  He was panting now. He reached out and grabbed a fistful of my hair, and then held up his gun like he was going to smack me across the face with it. Without thinking my arms swung out at him while I wished for him to be far away from me, eyes closed. They hit his sunken chest and I felt him wince. He shoved me down and my half-open mouth collided with the dirt and rocks beneath me, filling my cheeks with pebbles and soil and tearing my lip open. I cried as he let out something like a roar into the forest around us, wet with phlegm and rage and something that made me shiver, and then he walked away, lurching even more than before. I balled myself up and waited until I heard his car pull around the bend, then sprinted home. 

That evening, I got to watch tv because of what had happened, like I did when I was sick. I was wearing sky blue pajamas that I was too big for now, which i hadn’t worn in a couple years. One of my lips was misshapen and lumpy, big fat and purple, with a white gash in a beetroot red circle that slowli bleed into a sickly, almost black/ish purple. I sat there and I sucked on that lump like a jolly rancher, wincing each time my teeth touched it and set off a scream of pain that jumped through my jaw. We had a skylight, and the the skies above were a lovely cotton-candy pink and blue, until this  got drowned out by wretched flashes of red and blue and wailing sirens. First one car, then two more, then more. I went to bed and the next day, I learn what happened. My mom had called the cops on him, and when they knocked on his door he killed himself and his two dogs. Or, he refused to come out, and they called for more and they set up a perimeter, and then he killed himself and his two dogs. He was old and his wife had died, my grandma told me.  She didn’t say, but she didn’t think we should have done that. I could tell by how she pet my hair from then on—every once in awhile she would pull on my scalp just a little too rough, and for a second I could feel the sadness she held in the palm of her hands. 

He was buried next to his wife just down the road and his house left to rest, inherited by a son who had gotten married and had kids in a city someplace. When I was 15, I went with a tall brown-haired girl to look through it’s windows, intent on impressing her. I had told her of my fight, (even the little kids pajamas afterwards) to make her like me more, and it worked, and now I hoped to kiss her at the dead man’s cabin. It was April and the sky was blue as could be, but snow had fallen the week before and hadn’t yet melted away, so she wore black snow pants and a pink jacket and white snow boots. I thought she looked gorgeous, and I was embarrassed about how I wore normal shoes to seem strong to her and now she could tell I was miserable and my socks were soaked. Either way, though, we held hands on the way over. Without gloves on, our hands went numb in the early spring air, and melting snow would occasionally fall in a fat plop from a tree branch straight onto the backs of our hands. The slush melted immediately and ran in between our interlocked fingers, finding the cavern we made between our palms and evaporating into the pores of our palms. We talked about school and I could not have been happier. 

As we walked down the drive way to the dead man’s house, I realized it was painted a nice light green, with white shutters and a white porch. I thought it would be black. It was one story with a pointed roof, upon which a rusted red metal star was nailed in place facing straight up the driveway to the road. I’d seen this through the trees before as I drove by, wondering what it meant. The girl I liked walked right up the three steps and knocked on the door. I knew no one would answer, but still, I felt my throat close and my heart quicken. The girl I liked opened the door and walked in. 

The walls were wood and the floor was carpeted, until the counter that marked where the kitchen started. There the floor was linoleum, faded yellow like dandelions starting to wilt. Lit only by the sunlight that managed to squeeze between the shut blinds, colors here all looked like shades of grey. The cabinets were dark brown and the stove and fridge a beaten white. A wheelchair with lime-green arm rests sat in the corner, and a pile of blue metal canes with black rubber handles sat by the door. Nearly lined on the counter were plastic pill bottles, dulled by the dark into a sickly shade like bloody orange juice. I had just reached out to touch one when the dull end of a pistol comes whipping towards me. My stomach muscles twitch as my torso draws itself in on itself, my back folding in half to protect the soft young guts inside while a scream bursts out of my chest. My arms launched themselves up to defend myself, to move whoever wants to hurt me away, to help me survive another day. Instead they grip the sleeves of a pink waterproof jacket hurl push the girl I like into the fridge, where she let herself fall to the ground.. Slowly, with care, she unzipped her pink jacket and pulls down one shoulder, then pulled up the sleeve of the shirt she was  wearing (from our school’s soccer team). A blackish-forest green is already rising out of the depths of her arm, as thousands of broken blood vessels began pouring blood into her soft nice-smelling white skin. She began to cry, I began to cry, and I said “I’m sorry.” 

“Why did you do that?” she screamed back at me. 

She ran out, I followed. She jumped down the steps in one go and almost slips when she lands, and I could hear her gasp. By then she was really crying, and with the cold air now too she’d become the brightest angiest red. She turned around and the fear in her eyes made me stop in my tracks. I made the fear, I made the bruise. I am strong, I can hurt. 

“Please, just let me go home. I’m supposed to watch my little sister.” 

I tried to apologize, to explain, but she walked away, and I’m left. 

For days afterwards, I waited to be pulled aside in class, for the cops to bust down my door. Eventually, I realized it wasn’t going to happen. But until we graduated together, that girl was scared of me. Together, her and I watched myself grow every year, watched my muscles growing larger, thicker, fatter, watched my skin stretching to take up more and more of my mirror each day, watched my skeleton recede into the depths of what became an adult man. As it horrified her, it horrified me. 

I started spending the night more at my grandma’s in these years, without my mom accompanying me. I liked the freedom and the quiet. The year I was 17 I stayed there almost every weekend. Grandma was older, and in between those knick-knacks that had always been there, those same bloody-orange pill bottles and bright blue canes with rubber handles had begun to sprout up. Older now and no longer so afraid of the woods, my need for fear took on a new focus, where I swear I could feel illness, or aging, or death hear the call of the medicine. It would squirm its way up in between the cracks in the floor before pooling like acid rain and leaking slowly, constantly, as deep as it can go through the seven layers of skin we have right down to the raw-meat marrow tunnels that ran through our cores. I could see it, almost feel it happening, see the wormy tendrils stretching themselves to nothing, like when heavy summer rain storms hit the pitch black dirt and the water goes down searching for seeds somewhere in the center of the earth. But in the morning, I’d wake up, and she’d be making coffee with a black plastic coffee machine and there’d be pre-cut fruit from the supermarket, and me and her would sit happily for hours talking about nothing. 

We’d go for walks afterwards, because she didn’t need the cane until the afternoon, and we’d walk down her driveway and down her dirt road to where it became paved. We’d look for birds together. My favorites were the bluebirds with the orange chests that liked to hang out and fly around all together. I’d watch them dart around a grove of trees like a school of fish and imagine the tangled web they’d leave behind if their paths could be held. My grandma’s favorite were the yellow birds with black and white wings that ate at our neighbor’s birdfeeder. She always smiled in the spring time when we’d see two of them moving together as a couple, flying together to the feeder to eat a seed or two and then flying back to a nearby branch to let others have their turn. But the best days were when we’d see a heron in the little marshland across from her house.

 Massive, delicate, the color of a storm-cloud, wings that beat the air down so loud we could hear it from down the road. We’d watch it for hours, perched upon one leg, and if we were lucky we were close online to see into it’s eye (always just one eye visible at a time), staring back without flinching, never squinting, never shying away. These eyes were a flared-up hateful yellow, neon jaundice, constantly casting searchlights through the scum of the roadside swampland in hope that those same pathetic black-brown newts I loved when I was kid may stupidly slip out of it’s sanctuary of mud and dead leaves, at which point the heron’s neck would twitch and it’s second leg would descend from the down feathers on the bird’s underside and enter the water without creating a single ripple. Every muscle in the birds body was now being moved by hunger, hundreds of millions of cells working together in quiet desperation, absolutely focus, to bring a killing to the heron’s beak. Hunger so total, so deep, it looked like apathy, like instinct. The neck coiled like a snake and the chest fell closer to the little pond’s scummy surface, and me and my grandma would hold our breath, and then without a sound the head disappeared under water and came back up with a squirming little creature whose toes and tail would stand-out backlit by the morning sun for just about one second before being swallowed in their entirety to thereby be an  eaten thing forever. 

My mom had loved listening to me talk about newt toes when I was a kid, how cute it was that there were five of them just like us but on little slimey mitten-paws, when I told her that story, she didn’t smile. “That water is dirty,” she said. “When it rains the streets sewage comes up.” She didn’t come to visit grandma anymore, but always gave her big hugs when she came to pick me up, and never let me forget to say “I love you.” I knew it was because of that man who had died. I assumed it would heal with time, fading like my own fear of him had begun to. 

That’s not totally true. I may have thought about him less, but sometimes at night I’d get scared at, right as I began to drift off, I would hear his voice in the dark, in the room, just beyond where the light from the window ended. Clearly, confidently, with a strength he didn’t have when was alive, he would say my name, so crisp in the quiet room I felt like I could feel it in my jawbone. I would pretend not to hear and turn over, shaking under my blankets. My eyes shut like I was asleep, I would listen to my grandma’s uneven breath in the other room, thinking of pistol whips and spittle and deep-growths of death, until finally I managed to pass out. 

There was another boy from my school who lived at the other end of grandma’s road, and sometimes when I stayed over he’d come over late and night or noon on Sundays and we’d sit on her porch or in her basement and hangout. I liked him a lot, and grandma found it charming how polite he was. He’d always hug her and ask her how she was doing and offer to do her favors on weekdays if I wasn’t around, and it made her smile. When she wasn’t around, he’d ask me about what happened with the guy. I’d tell him about the pistol and the drive way and how I wouldn’t stop staring at the power lines and he’d laugh and tell me about how the man used to mess with him too. 

“I used to ride a little dirt bike up and down all the road, like a kid’s bike I got when I was like 7. That motherfucker would scream his head off, spitting everywhere, totally unintelligible. He’d try to chase me but his leg was fucked, because of like a blood clot he had. Honestly, I’d yell back. I’d taunt him. I was kind of a little prick. But anyways, so one day me and my mom and my brother were sitting on our porch, and he comes down our driveway and gets out with his hat in his hand, real polite. And he starts talking to my mom about how I ran over his foot on his bad leg, and my bike is dangerous to everyone on the street, and would she please control me. She’s polite, even though she knows he’s fucking crazy. Because she’s seen him doing his thing, she didn’t let me ride around unsupervised. I had to wear a bike helmet and wrist guards and shit, for Christ’s sake. So while this is happening, me and my brother are running around, and I look in the bed of his pick up truck and there’s like this purplish balloon kinda of thing in there. I climb on the tire to see what this is while he’s talking, and suddenly I see that the whole bed of his pick up truck is covered in deer guts. My dad said he had gotten in trouble for field dressing deer and leaving the guts in the middle of the woods, and so I think this was him trying to do the right thing. But I don’t know, they looked fucked up and old. I think maybe he had forgotten about them, because the rest of the deer wasn’t in there. The balloon was a stomach, and then there were these intestines that looked like these fat white eels, and just half-dried blood everywhere. And his truck was dirty, so the blood was like a slurry that was mixing with the dirt and his fucking trash, and I think maybe he wasn’t good at gutting deer with his fucked up old man hands so there were little flecks of fur in there. And I let out a little kid scream when I realize what I’m seeing, and he sees me on his truck and rushes over and grabs the back of my neck screaming to my mom about ‘see what I mean?’  And she starts screaming back to let me go and get off our property and he turns around all pissed but before he goes he grabs a fucking handful of guts from the back of his truck and throws them at me and my mom, and it gets in her mouth. And for like a week after, she got so sick. She couldn’t keep any food down, and she said there were pains in her chest and in her thighs. My dad wanted to sue them, but his wife and kid came over and I don’t know what they said but we didn’t. I think they gave us some money, honestly. But yeah man, it isn’t your fault at all. He was just a psycho.” 

He’d laugh when he told me the story sometimes, sometimes he’d look sad. The story confused him, I think. It confused me too. Then once, taking a walk in the woods behind grandma’s, I saw those same fat white eels he was talking about sitting on the forest’s floor of wet brown leaves, bright and shiny in the sun. Someone had gutted a deer back here. Excited, I ran over and got him. Together we circled it in silence, maybe play-acting scientists, maybe play-acting coyotes. He broke the silence. 

“Yeah. This is exactly what it looked like.” He knelt down and found a stick to poke in with. “God. Have you ever hunted?”

“Never, man. I don’t think I need to.” There was more grey and white than I had expected. “Someone told me if you shoot the stomach the guts explode inside the deer and spoil all the meat.”

My friend laughed. “That’s fucking disgusting.” We walked home laughing, happy together.

The next weekend I stayed at grandma’s, my friend showed up looking pale. He kissed my grandma on the cheek and complimented her haircut, but quickly slipped out to sit on the porch, waiting for me. I followed, and as my knees had just begun to bend he spoke. 

“Can we bury the deer?” His voice was shaky, like a kid’s after throwing a tantrum. Surprised, I looked over and saw him staring at me, his eyes wet with tears. “Please?” I didn’t ask any questions. I wanted to be the hero. 

“Of course.” 

We grabbed shovels from the shed behind grandma’s house and set off for the gut pile. As we walked he told me about the nightmares he’d been having of standing in the woods and bashing his own head into the trees until his brain leaks out and drips down on the front of his shirt. While he smashes his head into the bark again and again, he starts to laugh, but it’s the man’s laugh voice, and then he begins to say my name, but with the man’s voice. Then he walks home, one side of his head completely caved in, one eyeball down next to his lips, and instead of his own mom he sees the man’s wife waiting for him, and she kisses him and slips her tongue into his mouth. He stared at the ground as he told me this, clearly ashamed, with quick glances up to scan my face for disgust. I smiled back at him and said it must be hard, gladly covering my face with a kindness to hide the nausea I couldn’t help but feel growing in my stomach. For the first time, I told him about the girl, about how I saw the pistol-whip coming for my head and how she was just there. He doesn’t say much in return. 

“You shouldn’t have broken in. But it’s okay. It’s normal. It’s just kid stuff.” 

Finally, we get to the guts. They’re barely there,  eaten away by vultures and stray cats and the week that had passed since we’d last visited. I don’t know how my friend even knew. But if you looked close, there were still specks of red and pink and gristle scattered around, and we set to digging a little grave for them. The ground was hard— what wasn’t frozen was rock or tree root. It was on a steep and  uneven little patch of forest too, and we were slipping on the leaves as we dug like they were iced over even though it hadn’t snowed yet that year. My friend tried to stomp on his shovel to drive it into the ground with a little more force and he slipped backwards, falling flat on his ass. I let out a little laugh and before I can ask if he’s okay he swings his like a pickaxe and smacks my hip, hard. I almost fell but caught myself with my hands, and on almost all fours I saw him, knelt down on one knee and crying so hard that snot bubbled out his nose, and I felt insane. I felt like my bones were thrumming and I could feel it through my whole body. I wanted to hurt him back

With something like glee I jumped on my friend and began beating his chest with two closed fists, swinging them up and down like hammers. When I stopped to swing back and punch in his nose, his torso shot up and he wrapped his arm around my neck, my Adam’s Apple perfectly lodged in the crook of his elbow. He rolled on top of me and as I struggled, I realized my stomach was grinding itself into the flecks of deer meat left on ground. I remember how the sound of my own struggling, wheezing, screaming, crying, roaring all at once. Finally I threw my head back into his nose and he lets go, and I grabbed my shovel and swung it straight at his head. It mostly missed, but one of it’s sharp edges cut his forehead and then he’s bleeding but he still won’t stop. He staggered to his feet and grabbed his shovel and swung at me again, too tired and blinded by his own blood to pose a serious threat anymore. His kill shot made a wretched clanging sound as it hit a rock in the ground, making us both wince. The thrumming-in-my-bones feeling left me, replaced by a headache starting somewhere behind my eyes. The woods were dark by then. Staring at the earth we’d churned, I suddenly wondered if he had meant to dig a grave. If he’d meant to make me dig my own grave. If he’d wanted to bury me with rotten deer bits flecked across my chest. I stared at him, breathing too heavily to speak. He stared back, no longer sobbing, his face smeared with dirt and blood and snot, his eyes totally dead. He moved slow now, like he was made of wood, hauling himself up to his feet with visible pain in his every movement. “I fucking hate you,” he said. “This is all your fault.” 

“You’re pathetic,” I shot back. He walked away without another word. I sat and listened to the way his limp shuffled up the leaves of the forest floor.  When I couldn’t hear anymore I followed, dragging the two shovels behind me, unthinking until I stumbled through the back door of my grandma’s house and collapsed into bed. Comfortably cold, I laid on my back and tucked my arms across my chest, squishing my hands into my armpits to keep them warm. Then, like a silver-black frozen lake dissolving back into water, I felt the forest creep into the room with me. The darkness around me became bigger as the walls fell back behind marching pines and hardwoods creeping closer to my bedside. The flat plane of my old mattress began to wrinkle into an uneven patch of ground, though my body was still so wretched it felt fine. I stared as the ceiling peeled itself apart, revealing a web of dark branches through which could see some faint lace-like stars beginning to appear. Their soft white-grey light gave the deep blue sky a  welcoming feeling, like they were beckoning me to join them up there, and even though I knew I shouldn’t, I closed my eyes to rest for a second. A light barely-there mist began to fall, first felt on my eyelashes, lips, and the tip of my nose, then my cheekbones, my eyelids, and the base of my neck. The blood in my face still felt so warm from the fight that I imagined the mist may evaporate, even as I tightened my arms and clenched my fists to beat back the dropping temperature. I coughed up some dirt, forcing me to open up my eyes. Standing above me was the man, wrinkled and naked, staring into my eyes with the same hatred I’d just beaten my friend with, hatred like the heron’s hunger, so matter-of-fact it’s almost instinct. I could hear his wet breath, phlegm in his chest catching in his throat. Time stopped, the woods fell back and it came to me that I will never be rid of him. I realized this with true, true despair, a new feeling for me. Not fear or sadness or hate but total abject hopelessness, steadfast and absolute and born fully-formed. Now I knew that when I was a child and I’d panic staring into the  trees at night, it was him waiting there. Now I knew I was right to be so afraid. At the foot of my bed, he squatted down on one knee and laid his head on the side of my bed right by my feet. He stared at me, unblinking, and I stared into space, begging for sleep. 

I woke up half-way home in my mom’s car, with vague memories of her helping me stumble down the front porch steps, trailed by my hobbling grandma, gasping for air to keep up with us . The two of them were half-whispering and half-shouting at each other. I begged to watch TV. On my body the blood and the dirt had seemed one and the same, but on my bedding the stains they left were sharply different. In the passenger seat, I began to cry, so viciously that I was gasping for air and breathing in tears, choking on my own salt. My mom put her hand on my knee. We didn’t say a word. 

I didn’t stay at grandma’s anymore after that. She blamed my mom, and I never corrected her. She began to call our house more and more. If I answered we’d talk like nothing had happened, and I’d hang up smiling. When she got my mom, I’d hear her bellowing through the phone until her vocal cords gave out and she’d whisper hoarsely that she missed me and could I please come visit and that she was sorry I’d gotten hurt. I couldn’t hear this without feeling a small pain in my chest. I knew her sisters were dead. Her husband was dead. She’d had friends once, to laugh with. They were dead too. But gripped by fear, I’d say nothing, pretending not to know what was happening. My mom’s voice would get quiet here too, like she was talking to a little kid. “I’m sorry, mom,” she’d say “it’s too much. Too many things. It isn’t good for him.” Right before I turned 18, she died in her sleep. I had talked to her the night she died and told her I loved her. Still, she wasn’t found for six days, when a man went over to fix her sink. It was winter, and the family of sweet grey deer mice who had built a little nest in her walls to keep warm had set about eating her fingertips and eyelids and a bit of her nose.

1hhcjjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Socionics/comments/1hhcjjf/my_life_is_so_boring_and_i_want_to_hear_about/,My life is so boring and I want to hear about your life (mention your type please),"I (22F, either EII or IEI but I grew up with alpha quadra so it is difficult to figure it out as I've got a lot of alpha quadra values) am really bored. I haven't had many life experiences but it feels as if I have, just in a diferent way than most people.

For example, I have never even kissed anyone, I've been avoiding that because I always wanted it to be with someone special to me/who would be gentle and extremely caring towards me (to have an experience to remember forever), and I never found that in anyone (I did have crushes on people but couldn't be with them because they were always already married and they were older than me so my crushes were kept a secret, I was always attracted to people who were between 28 and 42, yes I am aware that might be weird but I always found that maturity so attractive, they always had that caring mature energy which would draw me to them) and now it's whatever, I don't feel like I need to experience kiss, it's just a kiss. But I experienced it in a dream a lot and it felt realistic so it feels as if I experienced it anyway (I think I am good at imagining how sensory things would feel despite never actually having them haha).

I had an ""experimenting"" phase (alcohol and nicotine) and realized that such hedonism isn't my lifestyle:
I drank alcohol many times this year and once (2 months ago) I got myself drunk to the point I had to be taken care of because I had a serious blackout (don't remember a lot of things from that night but I know I was vomitting a lot and I couldn't even stand and I had to be carried outside, and at some point I became conscious and felt as if I was going to die from intoxication, I literally got so scared for my life). I was lucky I was surrounded by ESEs and SEIs who were willing to help me get through that terrible experience because who knows how I would handle that night otherwise... I remember, a month before that, one person suggested we drink and I was like ""sure haha"" but another person (ESE) asked me ""who is gonna be able to take care of you if you get seriously drunk?"" and I didn't drink, I listened to her somewhat indirect advice not to drink. And she was right. Drinking is not for me, it's just not... Me? I guess.

I tried nicotine too, I was vaping for a few months but not much, I did it mostly for the taste rather than nicotine (I stopped, after what happened yesterday - will tell that soon). I tried nicotine pouches a few times and yesterday was the last time, LII gave me nicotine pouches and I put one on my gum for 20 minutes. I was feeling dizzy, felt like vomitting and could barely stand, I felt so weak and uncomfortable (he said ""you decided to take it, now deal with it haha""). Now nicotine disgusts me. And it ruins my health so my experimentation with unhealthy things has officially finished. I don't want to ruin my health more. I feel terrible in my body if I take unhealthy things for too long.

So I realized that lifestyle isn't mine. I prefer to go for a coffee or for cappuccino (or hot chocolate in winter), to go swimming in summer, to go ice skating in winter, to go to the river, etc. That's much better. But still, my life is so boring. I'll read about things/study about what I like (psychology and understanding the way different people perceive world differently) but it feels as if there is nothing left to discover and I am very bored. Anyone else feels like this? What do you do for fun? Please don't forget to mention your Socionics type (I'm curious) :)",1,1734557977.0,Socionics,0,1.0,False
1hhcj1d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hhcj1d,What a journey! So glad I found this group. ," SW: 228 CW: 195 GW: TBD, but probably 180.    Male, 56 (57 in July) 5’11…..First shot was Oct 8th,  so just over two months in. Total weight loss so far is 33lbs. 2.5mg and won't move up. 
 
 
I consider myself one of the fortunate ones—my body tends to respond relatively quickly to changes. I was a college athlete and one of those kids who couldn’t keep weight on no matter what I ate. Beanpole was a term thrown around a lot (and while that brought its own set of challenges, I am fully aware that it was nothing compared to the challenges and stigma of childhood obesity).

After getting married, my wife and I managed to stay fit for years, even after welcoming our first child. But, as many of you know all too well, things start to change as you get older. And by ""change,"" I mean your metabolism throws you a curveball—big time. 😂
Before I knew it, I’d ballooned up to 220 pounds. I decided enough was enough. I got back into biking, weight training, and cutting out most carbs. In just a few weeks, I dropped about 10 pounds and maintained 205-210 for a while.

2023 hit, and I underwent a major back surgery (quad laminectomy). Recovery sidelined me for months, and those months turned into over a year. Combine that with a desk job that keeps me sedentary, and—well, you can probably guess what happened. At my last doctor’s visit, I tipped the scales at 228 pounds.

For someone who’s been relatively fit most of his life, seeing those before photos was a major wake-up call. ESPECIALLY the one in the water. FFS!  I felt awful, disgusted with myself, and shocked that I’d let things spiral that far out of control.

So, I got serious. I talked to my doctor, got the blood work done, and made one of the best decisions I’ve ever made—for myself. (Bonus: my wife decided to make the same commitment.)
We didn’t tell anyone, because it’s nobody’s business. But the results didn’t come without a TON of hard work and a complete overhaul of my diet. As you all know, it’s not magic. It’s NOT cheating. It’s an assist.
My intake is almost zero carbs. (And trust me, I was the guy who ate spaghetti twice a week,  pizza, ramen noodles, chips, and Doritos late at night…you name it. I cut all of that immediately.)
The game changer was Zep; I was able to make these changes without ANY cravings. Which is crazy!
I also switched to nonfat, no-sugar coffee. (I can’t live without coffee—it’s a non-negotiable!) Surprisingly, it’s been a breeze.
We cut out almost all processed food. Something we knew we needed to do anyway as it's designed to fkn kill you...



The bottom line: I feel good again. Accomplished.  Like many of you, I actually like the person looking back at me in the mirror, and that is a big deal.

Looking ahead, I’ll probably stop in a couple of months (self-pay isn’t cheap) and consider migrating to Metformin to keep the cravings at bay. For anyone who’s done that, I’d love to hear about your experience—has it worked for you?

Keep pushing forward, everyone. It’s not easy, but it’s beyond worth it.

I feel like it’s just an all around damned situation, LGBT groups are either prohibitively expensive or I missed the memo (moved in town too late), the bars are dead, the bathhouses are so cliquey. I’m just a guy trying to find my person, and every day that I miss out I feel like by the time my turn would have come, there won’t be anyone left. Remember, there’s not very many of us to begin with so some of us are gonna die alone, and I’m fucking horrified of the idea of never getting to experience love before my time runs out. See and my thing is, I don’t think it’s cause I’m ugly, people on these apps comment on my appearance every day, but nobody wants to go grab a coffee and get out of the way, and that’s fine, but damn, is life always this lonely as a gay man?",0,1734557933.0,askgaybros,5,0.25,False

I recently tested **YSL Black Opium Over Red** at Sephora, and I completely fell in love with it. The cherry and vanilla notes mixed with jasmine and coffee are just perfection to me. Unfortunately, the price tag is a bit too steep for me right now, especially since I noticed the longevity wasn’t amazing when I tried it.

I’ve been on the hunt for a more affordable option that captures a similar vibe—something with cherry, vanilla, jasmine, or even coffee in the mix, but without leaning too leathery or smoky. I’ve heard of Zara perfumes and brands like Dossier or Maison Alhambra, but I’d love to hear your recommendations if you’ve found a good dupe or a scent with similar notes!

Alternatively, any tips for finding the real thing at a lower cost? Maybe outlets, decant sites, or sales I should keep an eye out for? I really want this scent in my life but want to make a smart choice financially.

i (19f) have never been close with my father. he was never interested in my hobbies, didn't try to engage with me and basically he preferred my sister over me and he admitted it out loud several times when i was a kid and even in front of other family members. i spent my whole life having a roommates relationship with him. with all of that, fate played a cruel joke and made me the spitting image of that man. i grew to have his habits even though i never spent time with him to pick up on them? i picked his attitude, his anger issues, his face, his personality and even his fucking interests??? god i even got the same mark he got in his uni entrance exam for my own.

we stopped talking in march due to a conflict he started. it wasn't even a conflict ngl, he just took a nap and when he woke up he refused to drive me to my class and insulted me. after that i never spoke to him ever again unless it's very, VERY necessary. 4 weeks ago i started going to uni. my father is an engineer and i happen to be studying cyber security engineering (apparently engineering was always my passion since i was in kindergarten). my father suddenly talks to me, bought me the necessary stuff which was very weird cuz he never bought anything for me before, not even a bday gift, my sis was the only one getting gifts from him. I've been sick for 4 days now, when i was lying on the floor asleep (it's just my comfort place lol) he helped me stand up, got to my bed and thrn made me orange juice BY HIMSELF and got me a cake too! he even bought me medicine!

I'll be honest, I currently use a K6 that I got in January and I really don't have any issue with the coffee it produces. This would entirely be a purchase of opportunity and out of the pure assumption that the Pietro would brew ""better"" coffee. I  do sometimes wish I got more flavor separation. I've done a direct comparison with a friend who has a Comandante and we could both tell a significant difference in the cup.

Those of you that have a Pietro, or have tried one, would you say the UX is worth putting up with at a price point of $250? Is it diminishing returns once you pass the K6, or would this truly be night and day?

Need help/advice from the community,"Hey guys, I was diagnosed with HSV-2 and am coming up on 2 years with the diagnosis. Man, I really am not sure where to start, so I'm just going to share my experience. Unsurprisingly, Doctors have been literally ZERO help since I was diagnosed and I really value the real-world experience that you guys have. 

I apologize, because I know that this sounds similar to many people's posts who are freshly diagnosed and confused, but that is not the case here. I feel like I've tried everything and that nothing is working. I'm praying to god that having antivirals again will help, but I am not convinced that it will from previous experience. 

DIAGNOSIS:  
I'm a 26M and on my 25th birthday I woke up with what I knew was not just an ingrown hair. After faking a big happy day with my family (due to anxiety from what may be going on in my shorts), I scheduled an appointment with my personal Dr. of 3-4 years. To make a long story short regarding the multiple Dr. appointments, they were completely uneducated & even sort of unwilling to discuss HSV with me. In fact, my Dr. tried to convince me on TWO separate visits in the same week, that what I had was not Herpes and I didn't have anything to be concerned about. Even after seeing my genitals, he tried telling me that I had a swollen Lymph node in my groin or even possibly a hernia and nothing else to worry about. Even still, I scheduled a third appointment and begged him to give me the REAL STD panel after finding out that Herpes is not included in the panel everyone normally takes (WTF). Reluctantly, he went through the process and I was diagnosed with HSV-2. 

Once he called me in for the results it was more of the same. I expected this guy to go do some research and have SOME SORT of solution for me, but it was the opposite. This Doctor LITERALLY could hardly tell me a single fact about HSV and even tried to convince me that in today's world we still know nothing about it. He prescribed me Valacyclovir (probably after a quick google search in the hallway) and basically refused to answer any questions I had, because supposedly he did not have any answers. I was dumbfounded. 

MY EXPERIENCE SINCE DIAGNOSIS: 

I'm a very healthy guy and was even training for a Natural Body Building Competition at the time of all of this. In the first 8-9 months of having HSV-2, I think I had a total of 3 OB's including the diagnosis and each lasted about 2-3 weeks. I was taking Valacyclovir as prescribed along with Cold Pressed Black Cumin pills, HTP-5 for stress, 1,000mg of Lysine, Zinc, and Lysine cream to apply on actual OB's. The second year however has been an absolute nightmare for multiple reasons.   
  
When I turned 26 and lost my insurance I stopped taking antivirals (about 6 months ago) because I have been unable to afford insurance just yet (I have just discovered [RO.co](http://RO.co) and am ordering their meds). But even going back to 2-3 month before losing antivirals I think I have been consistently getting OB's every month, even back to back, each lasting about 2-3 weeks as well.  

For me, I don't have many of the symptoms that I see in these subreddits. My OB's come without any pain, itchiness, tingling, or warning of any sort. Sometimes I just wake up to an OB that I otherwise WOULD NOT KNOW was there unless I checked and saw what look like pimples.   


I know that regardless, I need to get back on antivirals, but as I mentioned I started having these much more frequent OB's months before I lost the medicine and I'm scared that it won't help. My question to you guys is how in the fuck do I deal with this? My own Doctor can't even have a conversation with me and it seems like I am someone who's body does not handle the HSV supplements/meds very well. Other than stress relief, are there any other solutions or even things that could just help me that I haven't discovered yet? I'm not even sure what to ask for here. I have done countless hours of research and feel like nothing is working for me.   
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
VENT SESSION: this is not critical to my questions above, but I think finally getting this off of my chest anonymously may be very beneficial. This is the story of how I contracted HSV-2 If you guys have advice for me here as well it will be much appreciated, but if not, no worries and thank you for getting to the this point anyway.   


I'll try to keep this short, but about 3 months before my initial diagnosis, I started talking to a woman that I had the BIGGEST crush on for about 5 years. She is a little older than me and we used to work together. Out of nowhere I got the courage to go after her a bit and she reciprocated.

As I mentioned, we knew each-other really well and were friends for years before this. One day things started to get hot and heavy over text (I could have never dreamed this was happening, one of my biggest crushes ever) and we made a plan to spend the night together soon. Just a few days before, she decided to disclose to me her status of having HSV2. We spent hours talking about and her convincing me that it is not as big of a deal as the stigma makes it. She showed me her antivirals she was supposedly taking twice daily even without OB's and convinced me that she basically had the most minor chance of spreading it and that if I wore a condom and we practiced safe sex, that there was basically no chance of me contracting the virus. She also swore up and down she was not having an OB and hadn't in some time. 

Again, this was my biggest crush of about 5 years, almost my entire adult life. Once she disclosed, I was scared and kind of grossed out at the thought. I spent the next day or two doing hours of research and even though I saw that the stigma of Herpes is bullshit, I still was reluctant to sleep with her. When I tried to let her down easy she took it to heart BIG TIME. I was weak and I'm a fool for doing it, but after seeing her reaction, I decided to give her a chance not wanting her to feel so alone and depressed after being ""turned down again"" and that she'd never find anyone in this world. She shared with me the thoughts and feelings of loneliness and the fear of disclosing for nothing and unfortunately I let it get to me. 

The night came where we were going to stay together and I thought I came prepared. This might be TMI, but to be perfectly honest, it was maybe the worst sex I have ever had. I say this because it didn't last very long at all, maybe 5 minutes and not because of me either. The vibes were completely off. When we started it was hot and heavy, but she immediately became what I can only describe as ""Nervous"". This stood out to me immediately because the woman in question is the exact opposite of nervous. I'm talking about a bad bitch here, who spoke her mind and that I had never seen ""nervous"" in 5 years of being coworkers/friends seeing each other almost every day in and outside of work.

This completely through me off and I could never keep going in a situation like that, so I stopped completely and just asked her if we could just chill and watch some movies together. She was very obviously relieved (even tho she initiated every bit of this) and we fell asleep soon after. 

The next day she got up at the buttcrack of dawn and left. I hardly heard from her at all after this even after reaching out and she basically ghosted me. I was pretty torn up about it, but chalked it up to her being embarrassed maybe and then detaching/avoiding me.  



FAST-FORWARD TO 3 MONTHS LATER & DIAGNOSIS:

I reached out to this woman to let her know of my diagnosis. For someone who was so forth-coming with her info and so intimate about her feelings I really thought that she would have some kind of solace or advice as to how how I can handle this or what to do (mind you, I am coming to her after getting no help from my Doctor, which is mentioned above and I even informed her about). 

I was wrong. I didn't even get an apology from this woman. I initially just asked her to have some coffee with me to discuss how to deal with HSV and to get any advice from her that would help. Honestly after all the convincing and bargaining she did with me to get me to sleep with her, I thought she owed me this at the very least. 

In retrospect, I have a sneaking suspicion that the woman in question KNEW she was having or about to have an OB and that's why she got so nervous all of the sudden and that it may also be why she's basically refused to have any discussion about HSV with me after the fact. Again, I wore protection and there was no foreplay involved, so based off of what she had convinced me was true I am still to this day puzzled as to how I could have contracted HSV so easily, unless she was having an OB and purposefully did not disclose it. I feel like I have been done extremely dirty here and it has ruined my life.  

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
If you took the time to read this, I so much appreciate you. This diagnosis has completely destroyed my life and stripped me of any confidence I had before hand. I come from a family where two of my immediate members of my family have contemplated and even attempted suicide and honestly until this year I had never had those thoughts. I'm a good man, and I want to provide for my future family, but it just absolutely kills me inside that I may never have one because so much of the world is now never going to give me a chance once I disclose to them if I can even build the courage to do that. I'm having those same thoughts of loneliness and despair that she did, but as a man, I feel like it is so much worse. Especially, because I am actually packing up and moving across the country in March to follow a job. I won't know anyone there at all and have to restart my social life from scratch at 27 years old.   
  
I'm not even sure if sharing these thoughts will help me much, but getting this situation off my chest feels much better even before pressing the ""Post"" button. I'm trying to let go of this grudge I'm holding with this woman who I feel has ruined my life , but I've never been able to share the story of what actually happened. I am open to any opinions/ advice you guys may have and if I'm being too harsh on her then I can accept that, but I would like to hear input from the community and those who actually take pride in being truthful with disclosure and such. 

  
God bless you all.

Relatively recently transplant (M) to Vancouver (and Canada) here.

I've found my personal rhythm by now: geeking out about my work, chilling at coffee shops and enjoying relaxing walks around the Downtown Vancouver seawall, the beaches and Stanley Park. But I admit finding it pretty hard to make lasting, meaningful connections in this city .. although I'm an introvert, it'd be nice to share these activities (or other ones) with a friend over good chats.

My interests are fairly classic for a self-admitted nerd: video games (my work field is computer graphics), books, movies or anything science-related, really.

As I hail from elsewhere and moved around a fair amount, I also tend to enjoy chatting about travel, cultural differences, politics (the empathetic type of conversation, not the polarizing one :-) ) and generally enjoy exploring new places. Other things that I'm currently not that well-versed on but super interested in are basically anything arts or entertainment related, board/card games, that kind of stuff.

Although I guess I'm not very good at the usual sports, celebrities and exercise talk (even my exercise is geeky - Beat Saber VR :-) ), I'm happy to listen to people gush about their favorite niche topic (apart from maybe crypto & investments) that they happen to massively geek out about ... so, regale me with your extreme sports knitting obsession. :-)

I'm more of a 1:1 kind of person, but given sufficient time I'd be happy to expand to a wider group of friends.

Didn't include my exact age, but I've generally found myself connecting most deeply with others with a similar life situation (passionate about their work/study field + no kids, but also past the partying phase), so if you're looking for an age range it's probably more around 30-something, I guess?

I live and work in downtown, so whether you're a downtown worker looking for a lunch break buddy or a greater Vancouver area local that wants to spend more of their time exploring coffee shops and walks outside (or any other activities, really), I'm up for it.

Big fan of dogs and cats, by the way .. so would be more than happy to have a furball join the walks!",2,1734556789.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,0.75,False

I just bought an OPV from blue star coffee to install, and now that I’ve dissasembled my machine I’m not entirely sure on how to proceed before I break something I can’t replace easily.

Do I need to replace the plastic OPV-looking thing on top of the pump?

If not, how should I connect it?

Disco muy fino. Guitarras, voz buena y letras que suenan cojonudo. El disco tiene RUOK, tiene emo, tiene pop rock, tiene baladas, tiene canciones alegres y mala hostia. Un poco de todo y bastante sólido. Y es el segundo disco en dos (!) años.

**29. Axolotes Mexicanos – 4ever**  
Un buen disco con más guitarras que el anterior y canciones, en mi opinión, mucho mejores. Me gusta que arriesgan mucho más. Hasta hay canciones con influencias latinas, como “Al atardecer”, que suenan cojonudas, y colaboraciones maravillosas como esa “ROSAS Y ESPINAS” con Aiko el Grupo, y canciones increíbles como “Amarre” o “En mi corazón”. Para mí, el mejor disco que han sacado desde *Salu2*.

**28. from – Modelo para armar**  
From hace en este disco lo que todos esperaban de él: simplemente ser uno de los artistas más interesantes del panorama. En un disco te hace post-punk, en otro disco bedroom pop, en otro disco emo, y en este disco, una amalgama de influencias y estilos que van de la mano del lo-fi, sintes y voces pausadas. Gracias por existir, Fernando.

**27. Los Valientes – Dos de Cal**  
Baterías fuertes, bajos machacones, guitarras y ritmos acelerados que se pueden corear bien en un pogo, y estilo noventero. ¿Fórmula sencilla? Seguramente, pero efectiva. Segundo disco de ellos, pero muy, muy interesantes. Buen descubrimiento.

**26. Ática – II**  
Bajo y batería. Solo eso. Pero qué bueno que hayan vuelto. Y, joder, qué bien suenan.

**25. Biznaga – ¡Ahora!**  
El disco más pop de Biznaga, sin duda. Pero crítica social certera, letras que hacen pensar y mucha mala hostia contra este puto sistema. Hacen falta gente como ellos en este panorama.

**24. Roko Banana – Fins que surti el sol**  
Fino no, finísimo. RUOK bueno, bueno. Influencias noventeras y dosmileras que suenan cojonudo. Canciones que mezclan partes lentas con arranques, algún que otro grito, alguna balada y buenas guitarras. Yo no los conocía, así que para mí ha sido un gran descubrimiento. Totalmente recomendado.

**23. Camellos – Gran Hostal**  
Camellos vuelven a sus orígenes. Y lo hacen rodeados de amigos, con colaboraciones con Biznaga, Repion y Perro. Y vaya canciones en el disco. Sus letras de siempre, pero más críticas que nunca, y RUOK puro y duro que suena de puta madre. Y esas referencias como ese “Rompiendo España”, que es una referencia a una cuenta de memes que siempre se rumoreó que eran ellos.

**22. Paco Moreno – Rumbones**  
Paco Moreno es un genio. Y este disco lo demuestra, una vez más. Rumba pura y dura y letras sobre el amor. Otro tanto más en su haber, y ya van unos cuantos.

**21. Perdón – Debería de cuidarme más**  
Letras sobre depresión, precariedad, tristeza, salud mental y las durezas de la vida. Todo con una pátina de pop, letras pegadizas y colaboraciones con Marcelo Criminal, el cantante de El Buen Hijo y Aiko el Grupo. Para mí, ha sido súper entretenido de escuchar y me lo he pasado como un enano. Y, además, son de Murcia y no de Madrid, con lo cual se agradece.

**20. Mala Gestión – Se nos ha complicado**  
Un disco donde casi todas las canciones son de distintos estilos, donde te pueden cantar sobre las tristezas del amor, el metro de Valencia, una noche de fiesta donde te vas a casa pero te pierdes a Messi y a un colega explotándole un cojón, y una oda a un batido de caca. Tan solo por todo esto, para mí ha sido de lo mejor de este año.

**19. Atención Tsunami – Core**  
En este disco hay spoken-word, crítica social, guitarras de mala hostia, punk y letras cojonudas. Son ya veteranos, pero porque siguen sonando de puta madre.

**18. Los Estanques – Uve**  
¿Tienen Los Estanques un disco malo? Después de ese maravilloso *Burbuja cómoda y elefante inesperado*, Los Estanques suenan setenteros sin ser forzados, suenan divertidos sin ser estúpidos. En definitiva, suenan cojonudo. Como siempre, sus canciones son maravillosas; tanto te suenan como payasos de circo, como te cantan una balada armoniosa o te cantan en italiano. Si no los conocéis, por favor, escuchadlos. No os arrepentiréis.

**17. Baiuca – Barullo**  
Qué decir de Baiuca. Mezclar la electrónica con la música galega de forma fresca como lo hizo ya hace años, pero es que sigue manteniendo un nivel increíble. Y en este disco tiene colaboraciones con viejos conocidos como Antía Ameixeiras (quizás las mejores canciones del álbum en mi humilde opinión), Carlangas, Xurxo Fernandes, Felisa Segade o Lilaina. Cuando los astros se juntan... todo brilla. Discazo.

**16. Ramper – Solo postres**  
Post-rock, con letras buenísimas y una voz susurrante cantándotelas. Ya fueron de lo más sorprendente en España cuando sacaron su primer disco, y con este demuestran que no fue casualidad.

**15. Cometa – Fanfarria Clandestina**  
Escuché el disco sin muchas expectativas y me acabó flipando. Con cumbias, vientos, coros, guitarras, la mezcla de estilos y la virtuosidad de los músicos involucrados hace de este álbum una delicia para los oídos. Si te gusta experimentar, te lo recomiendo.

**14. The Low Flying Panic Attack – Far From Being Gone**  
Si The Low Flying Panic Attack fueran americanos o ingleses, estarían entre lo más escuchado del mundo. Pero este disco es una gozada de electrónica, voces increíbles y sonido finísimo. De lo mejor que hay en el panorama a día de hoy. Solo os digo que los escuchéis.

**13. Xenia – Cuando las sombras se alargan**  
Xenia ha abrazado la electrónica por completo. Canciones que, sinceramente, son de lo mejor que ha salido este año, como esa maravillosa “DONDE VA EL AMOR”. Desde electrónica oscura hasta techno en ese “NO GRITARÉ TU NOMBRE”. Incluso hay guitarras en la última canción, “61L4”, que es maravillosa.

**12. Marta Movidas – Martillo**  
Marta es de las pocas artistas que trae Japón a España sin sonar forzado y hablando de problemas de aquí. ¡Y cómo lo trae! Canciones sobre madurar, tristeza, separar caminos, y todo esto bajo una pátina de J-pop, 8-bit pop y hasta rock en algunas canciones. Suena como si estuvieras en un anime. Creo que no hay nadie en España que haga lo que hace Marta, y esto se agradece y mucho.

**11. Las Petunias – Creo que soy de porcelana**  
Pop-punk con guitarras, pero súper fino. Mala hostia, canciones pegadizas, letras elaboradas y ritmos endiablados hacen de este disco un debut increíble. Con canciones como “Mercerías las justas”, “Audi 4Latas”, “SHHH!!!”, “Avda Andraix”, que te hacen tararear; letras con mucha mala baba, frases que se te quedan en la cabeza y una voz increíble las reivindican. Por eso, para mí, están entre lo mejor que se ha hecho este año.

**10. Hinds – Viva Hinds**  
Hinds han vuelto, con dos nuevas miembras, pero con un sonido más refinado que nunca. A mí el disco me ha flipado y hay canciones que no he podido quitarme de la cabeza, como “Coffee”, que, si bien es súper sencilla, se te queda metida. Además, tienen otros temazos como ese maravilloso “Bon voyage” o esa “Superstar”. Sinceramente, los haters se pueden ir a tomar por culo, porque este disco ha sido callabocas a tutiplén. Tiene mérito sacarlo, además, cuando se te ha ido medio grupo.

**9. La Élite – Directos al infierno**  
Su disco más pop, pero también el más coreable. Con colaboraciones increíbles con Tetas Frías, como ese maravilloso “Illuminati Corp”; temazos para corear en pogos, como “Carafútbol” o ese “Perro Pantera” y ese maravilloso “Sangre Azul”. Los de La Élite han hecho un discazo. Y es el segundo (!) que sacan este año.

**8. Somos la Herencia – Joven predicador**  
Ya *Dolo* fue de lo mejor de Españita allá por 2020, pero este disco es finísimo. Baterías, guitarras, sintetizadores, rap, mala hostia y electrónica por todos lados, que hacen la escucha increíble. Siempre certeros.

**7. Seggs Tape – Seggs Tape**  
Egg punk con distorsión, guitarras y sintes que se dan la mano y letras pegadizas que hacen que disfrutes de este álbum como un enano. Para mí, de lo más destacado del panorama.

**6. Ultralágrima – Ultralágrima**  
Synth-pop y electrónica, algo de pianos, letras oníricas y tristes que hablan de huir, soledad, traumas y la búsqueda de la felicidad. Increíble álbum debut que pone a Ultralágrima como uno de los artistas a seguir en España.

**5. Alcalá Norte – Alcalá Norte**  
Vale, están en todos lados. Vale, son unos pesaos en Twitter. Pero su disco ha sido de lo mejor este año, y eso es indiscutible. Así que, si os gusta la música española de los 80, letras filosóficas, post-punk y canciones pegadizas, este es vuestro grupo.

**4. Carolina Durante – Elige tu propia aventura**  
Carolina Durante han crecido y se han puesto tristes. Este disco contiene las canciones más elaboradas; Diego canta más melódico y se alejan más de esa música de la movida. Desde colaboraciones con Rosalía (!), odas a tomar café, y ese estupendo “Joderse la vida” que abre el disco, hasta otras canciones maravillosas como “Hamburguesas”, “Monstruo” y “Misil”. ¿Quizás el mejor disco de ellos? Pues podría ser.

**3. Mourn – The Avoider**  
Lo nuevo de Mourn empieza fuerte con ese “Endless Looping”, que te deja con ganas de más; sigue con ese “Could Be Friends” tan pegadizo y continúa con guitarras tristes noventeras (incluso con toques emo) y esas voces ya tan características. Con baladas increíbles como “Heal Hill”, donde mezclan el inglés con el castellano, o canciones como “The Avoider”, donde entran sintetizadores en la fórmula. Disco muy bueno y, con suerte, la gente en España las conocerá más.

**2. Perro – ¿Te acuerdas?**  
Después de 8 (!) años, vuelven otra vez. Y vaya disco. No solo son los Perro de siempre, sino que han evolucionado, y este álbum tiene de todo: nuevas ideas, letras incisivas, frases para la posteridad y ritmos endiablados. Hay HIMNOS como ese “Escucha, Pariente”, ese “Gracias, de Nada” y ese “Y Si No Revienta”. Hay guitarras (muchas) y hasta funk (!). Son de lo mejor que hay en Españita, y con este disco demuestran que no han perdido su fuerza. ¡Qué bueno que hayan venido!

**1. Viva Belgrado – Cancionero de los cielos**  
He de reconocer que, cuando sacaron los singles, no me entraron mucho. El cambio de formación y ese “Elena Observando la Osa Mayor” me dejó un poco contrariado, aunque me gustó. Y ese “Perfect Blue” también me pareció un poco raro. Pero fue salir el disco y entenderlo todo. Todas las canciones son coherentes entre ellas y brillan con luz propia al escuchar el disco entero. Hay baladas, hay rap (!), hay gritos, hay hardcore, hay ritmos de conga (!!), y hay canciones maravillosas como “Saturno Devorando a su Hijo”, que, para mí, es de las mejores que han sacado nunca, o las maravillosas “Chejov y las Gaviotas” y ""El Cristo de los Faroles"". Y hay delicadeza en esas ""Ranchera de la mina"" o ""Nana de la Luna Pena"", y mucha mala hostia y critica directa en la maravillosa ""Vernissage"" que abre el disco. Creo que casi cualquiera de los temas podría haber sido un single y no desentonaría. Hay quien dice que este es su mejor disco. Me lo tendría que pensar, pero incluso podría estar de acuerdo. Pocos grupos se pueden acercar a la creatividad, riesgo y letras de Viva Belgrado. Que se traigan bufanda porque pasarán frío en la cima.

1hhc0ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/HSVpositive/comments/1hhc0ei/2_years_diagnosed_sorry_for_the_long_read_i/,2 years diagnosed. Sorry for the long read. I really need help & advice from the community. ,"Hey guys, I was diagnosed with HSV-2 and am coming up on 2 years with the diagnosis. Man, I really am not sure where to start, so I'm just going to share my experience. Unsurprisingly, Doctors have been literally ZERO help since I was diagnosed and I really value the real-world experience that you guys have. 

I apologize, because I know that this sounds similar to many people's posts who are freshly diagnosed and confused, but that is not the case here. I feel like I've tried everything and that nothing is working. I'm praying to god that having antivirals again will help, but I am not convinced that it will from previous experience. 

DIAGNOSIS:  
I'm a 26M and on my 25th birthday I woke up with what I knew was not just an ingrown hair. After faking a big happy day with my family (due to anxiety from what may be going on in my shorts), I scheduled an appointment with my personal Dr. of 3-4 years. To make a long story short regarding the multiple Dr. appointments, they were completely uneducated & even sort of unwilling to discuss HSV with me. In fact, my Dr. tried to convince me on TWO separate visits in the same week, that what I had was not Herpes and I didn't have anything to be concerned about. Even after seeing my genitals, he tried telling me that I had a swollen Lymph node in my groin or even possibly a hernia and nothing else to worry about. Even still, I scheduled a third appointment and begged him to give me the REAL STD panel after finding out that Herpes is not included in the panel everyone normally takes (WTF). Reluctantly, he went through the process and I was diagnosed with HSV-2. 

Once he called me in for the results it was more of the same. I expected this guy to go do some research and have SOME SORT of solution for me, but it was the opposite. This Doctor LITERALLY could hardly tell me a single fact about HSV and even tried to convince me that in today's world we still know nothing about it. He prescribed me Valacyclovir (probably after a quick google search in the hallway) and basically refused to answer any questions I had, because supposedly he did not have any answers. I was dumbfounded. 

MY EXPERIENCE SINCE DIAGNOSIS: 

I'm a very healthy guy and was even training for a Natural Body Building Competition at the time of all of this. In the first 8-9 months of having HSV-2, I think I had a total of 3 OB's including the diagnosis and each lasted about 2-3 weeks. I was taking Valacyclovir as prescribed along with Cold Pressed Black Cumin pills, HTP-5 for stress, 1,000mg of Lysine, Zinc, and Lysine cream to apply on actual OB's. The second year however has been an absolute nightmare for multiple reasons.   
  
When I turned 26 and lost my insurance I stopped taking antivirals (about 6 months ago) because I have been unable to afford insurance just yet (I have just discovered [RO.co](http://RO.co) and am ordering their meds). But even going back to 2-3 month before losing antivirals I think I have been consistently getting OB's every month, even back to back, each lasting about 2-3 weeks as well.  

For me, I don't have many of the symptoms that I see in these subreddits. My OB's come without any pain, itchiness, tingling, or warning of any sort. Sometimes I just wake up to an OB that I otherwise WOULD NOT KNOW was there unless I checked and saw what look like pimples.   


I know that regardless, I need to get back on antivirals, but as I mentioned I started having these much more frequent OB's months before I lost the medicine and I'm scared that it won't help. My question to you guys is how in the fuck do I deal with this? My own Doctor can't even have a conversation with me and it seems like I am someone who's body does not handle the HSV supplements/meds very well. Other than stress relief, are there any other solutions or even things that could just help me that I haven't discovered yet? I'm not even sure what to ask for here. I have done countless hours of research and feel like nothing is working for me.   
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
VENT SESSION: this is not critical to my questions above, but I think finally getting this off of my chest anonymously may be very beneficial. This is the story of how I contracted HSV-2 If you guys have advice for me here as well it will be much appreciated, but if not, no worries and thank you for getting to the this point anyway.   


I'll try to keep this short, but about 3 months before my initial diagnosis, I started talking to a woman that I had the BIGGEST crush on for about 5 years. She is a little older than me and we used to work together. Out of nowhere I got the courage to go after her a bit and she reciprocated.

As I mentioned, we knew each-other really well and were friends for years before this. One day things started to get hot and heavy over text (I could have never dreamed this was happening, one of my biggest crushes ever) and we made a plan to spend the night together soon. Just a few days before, she decided to disclose to me her status of having HSV2. We spent hours talking about and her convincing me that it is not as big of a deal as the stigma makes it. She showed me her antivirals she was supposedly taking twice daily even without OB's and convinced me that she basically had the most minor chance of spreading it and that if I wore a condom and we practiced safe sex, that there was basically no chance of me contracting the virus. She also swore up and down she was not having an OB and hadn't in some time. 

Again, this was my biggest crush of about 5 years, almost my entire adult life. Once she disclosed, I was scared and kind of grossed out at the thought. I spent the next day or two doing hours of research and even though I saw that the stigma of Herpes is bullshit, I still was reluctant to sleep with her. When I tried to let her down easy she took it to heart BIG TIME. I was weak and I'm a fool for doing it, but after seeing her reaction, I decided to give her a chance not wanting her to feel so alone and depressed after being ""turned down again"" and that she'd never find anyone in this world. She shared with me the thoughts and feelings of loneliness and the fear of disclosing for nothing and unfortunately I let it get to me. 

The night came where we were going to stay together and I thought I came prepared. This might be TMI, but to be perfectly honest, it was maybe the worst sex I have ever had. I say this because it didn't last very long at all, maybe 5 minutes and not because of me either. The vibes were completely off. When we started it was hot and heavy, but she immediately became what I can only describe as ""Nervous"". This stood out to me immediately because the woman in question is the exact opposite of nervous. I'm talking about a bad bitch here, who spoke her mind and that I had never seen ""nervous"" in 5 years of being coworkers/friends seeing each other almost every day in and outside of work.

This completely through me off and I could never keep going in a situation like that, so I stopped completely and just asked her if we could just chill and watch some movies together. She was very obviously relieved (even tho she initiated every bit of this) and we fell asleep soon after. 

The next day she got up at the buttcrack of dawn and left. I hardly heard from her at all after this even after reaching out and she basically ghosted me. I was pretty torn up about it, but chalked it up to her being embarrassed maybe and then detaching/avoiding me.  



FAST-FORWARD TO 3 MONTHS LATER & DIAGNOSIS:

I reached out to this woman to let her know of my diagnosis. For someone who was so forth-coming with her info and so intimate about her feelings I really thought that she would have some kind of solace or advice as to how how I can handle this or what to do (mind you, I am coming to her after getting no help from my Doctor, which is mentioned above and I even informed her about). 

I was wrong. I didn't even get an apology from this woman. I initially just asked her to have some coffee with me to discuss how to deal with HSV and to get any advice from her that would help. Honestly after all the convincing and bargaining she did with me to get me to sleep with her, I thought she owed me this at the very least. 

In retrospect, I have a sneaking suspicion that the woman in question KNEW she was having or about to have an OB and that's why she got so nervous all of the sudden and that it may also be why she's basically refused to have any discussion about HSV with me after the fact. Again, I wore protection and there was no foreplay involved, so based off of what she had convinced me was true I am still to this day puzzled as to how I could have contracted HSV so easily, unless she was having an OB and purposefully did not disclose it. I feel like I have been done extremely dirty here and it has ruined my life.  

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
If you took the time to read this, I so much appreciate you. This diagnosis has completely destroyed my life and stripped me of any confidence I had before hand. I come from a family where two of my immediate members of my family have contemplated and even attempted suicide and honestly until this year I had never had those thoughts. I'm a good man, and I want to provide for my future family, but it just absolutely kills me inside that I may never have one because so much of the world is now never going to give me a chance once I disclose to them if I can even build the courage to do that. I'm having those same thoughts of loneliness and despair that she did, but as a man, I feel like it is so much worse. Especially, because I am actually packing up and moving across the country in March to follow a job. I won't know anyone there at all and have to restart my social life from scratch at 27 years old.   
  
I'm not even sure if sharing these thoughts will help me much, but getting this situation off my chest feels much better even before pressing the ""Post"" button. I'm trying to let go of this grudge I'm holding with this woman who I feel has ruined my life , but I've never been able to share the story of what actually happened. I am open to any opinions/ advice you guys may have and if I'm being too harsh on her then I can accept that, but I would like to hear input from the community and those who actually take pride in being truthful with disclosure and such. 

  
God bless you all.

1hhbvze,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hhbvze,Just got my new grinder,"Well, not sure if I got the right grinder but lots of people suggested I get a proper grinder, instead of using my blender. And, I have to say, you were all so right on that. I just made my first Aeropress coffee using hand ground coffee and it was like a totally different drink. As different as night and day, or even instand coffee and espresso. Thank you to everyone who told me I needed a proper grinder. 

I decided to just get a cheaper one to see what it was like to use. After watching a few YouTube videos I settled on the KINgrind K2, it was had a plastic body but was cheap so I could try it out and see if I liked hand grinding. When it arrived I was surprised to find it was all metal construction, with the exception of the clear (frosted) lid which is plastic. Although it was cheap it has a high quality feel and grinds the coffee really well, at least in my limited experience. My only complaint is the very skimpy set of instructions. I had to Google how to set grind level. 

I actually enjoyed using it, it didn’t take very long to grind my 18g of coffee. And then the brewing, much smoother than the the gravel I used before, after grinding with a blender. The finished coffee was so much better. I’m not sure at the moment if I’ll upgrade the grinder and it’s really much better than I was expecting. ",9,1734556231.0,AeroPress,1,0.91,False

While out for a coffee, my sister posed the most important question of all; ''If you could be a part of any fictional world, which one would it be?'' Without any thought, I immediately said the Harry Potter/Hogwarts Legacy universe. As a result, I've now been left with the itch that I just need to scratch. Thus, I've come to you- or Reddit rather, in search of someone who's sharing the same passion and enthusiasm about roleplaying in such a world/setting.

  
But first things first, some things about me;  

My name is Vyra, and I've been roleplaying for over 8 years. I'm 21 years of age and my role-play style varies from lit to novella, 3rd person. I like to return in the same fashion that I receive.

  
Some 'requirements' if you will;  

• Be over the age of 18.

• The rp will happen over Discord. This will be am OC x OC roleplay, with me doubling as side characters (such as faculty members, other students, the bad guys) to get the roleplay going. 

• Communication. I work every single day, so this is my only outlet at the moment. Life gets busy, I get it, but I do ask that you do not reach out about this if you're gonna get cold feet mid roleplay. I wanna do this long term with someone who's willing to commit and be open to communication. 
  
• Have the same style of roleplay. As in, past tense, 3rd person. I'm not expecting a novel, but I'd like a bare minimum of nicely fledged paragraphs. 

• I would like to have a a romance subplot between the characters, especially if there's an interesting dynamic. I'm comfortable with MxF pairings, with me roleplaying as the F. 
  
That's about it I think.
  
If you're interested send me a small introduction pm along with a rp sample to see if our roleplay styles would be compatible.

One more thing is, I kind of have a plot in mind, but it is not fully fledged out. I do have some ideas that I'd like to bring to the table. Usually I like to look at the other person's OC first and then come up with something. If you have any ideas (which would be awesome if you did) or any plots, do include them!

My friend is a dom, and sometimes we do play together or do a couple scenes. I enjoy it, he enjoys it, it’s a fun and mutual time. 

He’s got a girlfriend, she’s honestly a really cool person and we’ve become good friends. She moved across the state to be closer to him, and it seemed like the both of them hit it off well. 

I went to go visit them both recently. I’m not that involved in their lives, usually doing a nice “how are you” weekly convo kind of thing. From what the gf tells me, she hasn’t gotten much play time with him; he denies her, because “it’s fun when she whines” (her words, verbatim of his words) which I get. That is his preferred mini torture tactic. Some people’s libidos are different, I wasn’t sure what else to say besides that and “I’m sorry”. 

Later that night, me and my friend are chilling on the couch. I’m watching tiktoks, he’s playing his video games. He randomly rubs his hand on my face (weird little thing he does idk I like it) so I smush my hand on his face back. I drop my hand over his leg, and instantly we give each other looks. “Oh yeah?” Looks, you know? 

Next thing I know, he’s grabbing my hair and pulling my head over his lap, with a “get to work” kind of tone, so I did. I’ll skip over, but long story short, playtime happened in the living room and in another fun location. 

Next morning I wake up, gf is sitting on the couch next to me watching tv so we talk for a minute. She sees his underwear in the corner and asks if we had playtime. I didn’t want to lie, so I didn’t. She just nods and looks back at the tv, and so do I. After a few minutes, she said she’s gonna try to go sleep some more. I assumed that she was upset over the clothes being on the floor. (I was not aware that they had gotten together officially until I went back home the day after.) 

We went to go get coffee, I asked her what was on her mind. She told me that my friend kept mumbling in his sleep. “I want you. ******* will be mad. She’s gonna be mad.” 

The car was dead silent.  I honestly didn’t know what to say to make it remotely better. She said she wasn’t mad at me. That it isn’t on me, but I feel like it is. “Why is it that when you’re here, he’s always ready??”

I didn’t know that they are officially together, I would never do something like that. I feel like a terrible friend to her, but my friend isn’t mad at me. He told me not to worry, he said that he’d talk to her. Idk what that means, but I feel like that it’s my fault.

1hhbiyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hhbiyx/abdominal_pain_concerns/,Abdominal pain concerns,"Hi there. I am 29F, 144lbs, 5’9”, history of POTS, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos, and some never-identified autoimmune issues (positive ANA x3, low C3/C4, only other things were physical symptoms) that seemed to have subsided, but never got bloodwork rechecked. Occasionally low vit d. All of that is pretty irrelevant to my symptoms now. I did have one instance of a ruptured hemorrhagic ovarian cyst that could be relevant. I have had yellow diarrhea for months now where mucus and fat is present. I have lost a significant amount of weight the past year due to it. Looking at notes, I weighed 178 lbs in Dec 2023 compared to my 144 now with no exercise. I have a GI appt scheduled, but it is not until April. I take 10mg Adderall for ADHD usually 4-5 times a week and 5 mg cyclobenzaprine occasionally for relaxing my tight muscles. I did not take cyclobenzaprine last evening.

I began my day with a slight stomachache. It felt like it was central and just above my belly button. A gnawing, achy feeling. I’m used to menstrual cramps, but I just completed my cycle less than 1 week ago. I woke up with this ache and attributed it to my dinner last night of spaghetti, bread, and sharing a bottle of Riesling with my partner. I went to work where it got a little worse, but I thought it would go away. I had no appetite (not unusual for me) but always have one cup of coffee. I drank the coffee and still wasn’t concerned. I have an urgent, yellow bowel movement which isn’t unusual for me right now. Around 11am, the ache gets worse. I’m super uncomfortable and leave work just so I can lay down. On my drive home, every bump is making it worse. I get home around 12pm and it is just increasingly worse. I haven’t eaten, and have no desire to. The pain is moving lower, below my belly button but is still central. I take my temperature to see if I have a fever, not really, it’s hovering at 99. I feel like I need to vomit. I dry heave for about 4 minutes but no vomit.

I lay on my couch and tell my partner I went home for not feeling well and about the dry heaving. She asks if I ate and I said no, I have no appetite. She orders me some soup via DoorDash and I don’t want to eat it, but am just maybe hoping I am terribly hungry (? I wasn’t.) I eat it. The pain is just worse. I feel waves of nausea and like I need to poop - but I can’t. Now THAT is unusual. Typically it’s yellow, watery, comes out of me no problem LOL. 

I have not pooped, but I have burped which insinuates I’m maybe just really gassy? The pain is still central, low, but is also on my right side now. My right hip starts getting burning sensations occasionally. Getting up seems harder but not completely *painful*. I’d rate it a 5/10. I do the rebound test on my abdomen and yeah it hurts, but I’m not screeching in pain.

At this point I’m concerned about appendicitis. Admittedly I’m a bit of a hypochondriac, but this is unrelenting and gnawing. It’s not SUPER painful, but I do have a higher pain tolerance. Or, another ovarian cyst as the one that burst was on my right ovary, so presented very similarly. I’m struggling taking it so seriously as appendicitis because of my recent history of GI issues. I know how people abuse the ER, and don’t want to contribute to that unless this is serious. At what point do I take this seriously and drag my ass in?

1hhbgti,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesfromtheDogHouse/comments/1hhbgti/when_did_my_mom_turn_into_a_nutter/,When Did My Mom Turn Into a Nutter?,"Just to give a little background my mom grew up on a farm, where dogs were mostly kept outside, until she got one as a senior in HS and my grandparents let her have it inside. Within a year or two she moved out dumping the dog on my grandparents. 

When I was growing up though, my dad never allowed us to have dogs (thanks dad <3). Despite whines from my mom, my siblings and I he stood firm. No dogs. He hates mess, smells and fur. However one day, he picked me up from choir and told me he had a surprise for me at home. We get home and a golden retriever jumped up on me. Idk what changed his mind. 

2 years later my parents would divorce and my dad would leave the home. In that time my mom neglected the dog, it became so god forsaken skinny that an old lady down the road was sneaking into our yard feeding her apples. The fur was everywhere, piles of dog shit on the basketball court because my mom was too lazy to open the gate and let her in the yard. Thankfully my cousin became aware of the situation and took that dog. I don’t like dogs, but she needed to be saved. The condition my mom allowed her to be in was disgusting. She deserved better. I was so young, I didn’t know how to feed her and there wasn’t any dog food. 

But it continues now. My sister got a divorce and could no longer care for her Pomeranian. So she let my mom take him. The dog is horrid. It pees all over the house. I brought my kids over and it peed in my daughter’s shoes. My mom disciplines him by simply saying “no! Bad monka-butt!” Once she brought it to my house during a tornado despite my pleas not to. The minute she walked in I snatched it and wrapped an ace bandage with a menstrual pad attached to it because I knew it was going to try and pee everywhere and my mom didn’t bring belly bands. It stayed for an hour. Bu the end of that hour as expected, the menstrual pad was soaked and significantly heavier and the dog REEKED of piss. It stinks. It constantly barks to which my mom responds “thank you good boy”. She refers to me as “Aunt myname” to the dog.  

Once again though, this dog is neglected. Aside from the piss house my mom lives in that can’t be healthy for either of them, he’s had fleas for years. He’s constantly scratching, blood in his fur and literal tears in his eyes. He looks horrid. Nothing like the almost cute, fluffy well maintained dog my sister handed over years ago. This isn’t age. It’s neglect. She “treats” the fleas with diatomaceous earth and a Walmart flea chew. They never go away. They just die down a little and then ramp up again. I truly feel bad for this thing. 

But my mom just pretends it’s all good. She takes this dog everywhere. Coffee shops, gas stations, errands. You name it. She refers to him as her “baby” and no, this isn’t empty nester syndrome, she couldn’t wait to get my sister and I moved out before 18. 

The more I see her brain dead, childish, dog nutter behavior, the more grateful I am to my dad for refusing animals for so long. God knows it kept them out of an early grave and taught me how to be a clean person. ",13,1734555171.0,TalesfromtheDogHouse,5,1.0,False

1hhbc6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hhbc6o/feet_first/,Feet First,"Fire is a dangerous thing. Extremely dangerous. It moves faster than you’d hoped, hotter than your plans anticipated, has more longevity than you’d thought. Wherever Humanity has gone, fire has followed.

It can be bad enough when your oven goes up and you’re just putting a room out. But wildfires are the real horror. If a house fire is a murderer with a pistol, a wildfire can be a toddler with a machine gun. Completely irrational, very difficult to predict, *extremely* deadly, and they’ll kick off at the most random thing.

Our generation is lucky, compared to our 21st century predecessors. Every year they fought wildfires dwarfing our usual fare, and they did it with worse tech and weaker tactics. For years they got worse and worse, as the climate slowly tipped more and more into chaos, stagnant budget versus growing fires. And that’s not even getting into the War Fires. Some of them were touched off by our nukes, some by the Hekatians, but it doesn’t matter, given they were apocalyptic all the same. The people who went out and fought those fires, in the midst of the largest war in Human history, and with so little equipment… that's the kind of bravery we can only hope to match.

23rd century firefighting looks a lot different, though. More calm. The regulars, half the time they’re setting and controlling fires to keep the *real* ones from getting too dangerous. The rest is either putting shit out, or keeping a very watchful eye on the natural ones to stop them causing too much harm. And, in a sense, what *we* do as specialised firefighters now isn’t too radically different from our *particular* predecessors.

See, we're called Smokejumpers for a reason. Back in the pre-war days, a Smokejumper was someone who jumped out of a plane to tackle wildfires. We still do that, but only when… *other* means are unavailable. No, we usually jump from much higher. 100km up, to be precise, from Earth’s orbital rings.

We base at stations across and above the globe, never more than a quick ride away on the ultra-high speed trains that race across the Earth’s skies. As soon as satellites detect a fire in the wilderness, we mobilise, hopping rides on the dedicated maintenance tracks of a ring. Usually we have to transfer from ring to ring, sometimes we don’t. Chances are, if you look out the window on your train ride and see a maintenance train racing along, it’s got us onboard. 

Once we reach the optimum jump point, we disembark, and earn our name. Often it will be a VALO or VAHO, Very high Altitude Low Opening or High Opening respectively. And VAVO, but you can guess that one hopefully. Alternatively, we use wingsuits, paragliders, or whatever else may be appropriate under the circumstances. Billions of people have seen the Earth from space, plenty have seen the Earth from an orbital ring: very few have ever had the chance to slowly glide over it like we do. 

In the event that we cannot get close enough from up there, we use dropships, high speed atmospheric craft, whatever is most appropriate. Every smokejumper is a highly qualified parachutist from every platform we operate from, and equipped with only the best equipment. Our gear is more akin to the battle armour of the Orbital Infantry or the Stellar Army, enclosed systems proof against everything from vacuum to volcanoes. With us on every jump is a procession of drones, equipment for any scenario of every duration.

On the ground, our missions are simple. Assess the fire, and the land as it stands, the way only eyes on the ground can. Regardless of if we intend to let it burn in a controlled manner, or snuff it out, we use the same tactics: rapidly constructing firebreaks, burning out fuel before the fire can reach it. 

We also search for locals in danger, civilians that have gone off the grid, hikers, and so on, to try and evacuate if necessary. On one recent jump, our unit found a pair of Hekatian hikers that had been lost for a week. That was a rather fun evacuation.

Then there’s the job of directing aerial firefighting, coordinating planes and airships and helicopters and drones for maximum effect. Modern firefighting is a fine art, a delicate dance of man and machine, in which every effort must be invested to keep flame at bay and civilians alive.

Our fight is not limited to Earth, of course. There are smokejumpers on every world with breathable atmosphere. Where people go, flame follows, and us in turn.

And we do more than just wildfires. Volcanic eruptions are close to our wheelhouse, but we are also deployed for other natural disasters, floods and earthquakes and so on, when appropriate.

We are not interstellar heroes, not even national heroes. Very few people ever see our deeds, let alone us. We don’t care. Our job is not to be famous. It is to save land, homes, and lives. Our greatest victory is if you never have to know about us.

We are the smokejumpers. We go feet first into hell, and leave it frozen over.

I'm going to start a video journey of this on a separate youtube channel and see how well it works. My problem in self-teaching is not having direction. Having something create a curriculum seems to be a very excellent way to get you started.

# Prompt:

 Create for me a curriculum to follow to become familiar with the most recent version of Blendr. Include assignments with descriptive prompts to plug into LLMs so that assignments can be propagated and thus provide clear instructions on how to complete each assignment. Include a timeline for beginner, advanced, and expert levels of completion and divide each curriculum by those three parameters. By the end of this curriculum I want to be an expert at using Blendr.

# 

*ChatGPTThought about Blendr learning curriculum for 4 seconds*

# Output:

Below is a comprehensive 12-week curriculum divided into three tiers—Beginner (Weeks 1-4), Advanced (Weeks 5-8), and Expert (Weeks 9-12)—designed to guide you from a complete novice to an expert user of the latest version of Blender.

Today while in the drive through for coffee my car completely turned off, no music, no warning. Not long ago just my dashboard turned off on the same road but the car would still move.

1hhb1tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1hhb1tm/decluttering_lessons_from_tiny_living_fulltime_rv/,Decluttering Lessons from Tiny Living (Full-time RV),"This is a long one. Moved into an RV full-time earlier this year and learned some lessons about minimalism by being forced to declutter down to the ""essentials"" and live in under 400 sq ft. Our RV is 33ft long with three slides. My husband and I live in it with our two dogs. 

1. Buy high-quality the first time. All of my plastic tupperware is breaking. My clothing is faded, pilled, and fraying. The cheap satin lining of my one good winter coat has holes in both pockets and doesn't like to be mended. My shoes are falling apart. My glasses are all wonky and scratched. I need to replace all of these things, and I cannot afford to. All of these things could've been avoided if I had bought higher quality items to begin with. And, most importantly, I learned the hard way that pretty much nothing I own has any resale value. We don't think about that too often, do we? When you're making okay money, you buy whatever you want nearly as soon as you want it. Then, when you're in a pinch financially, you hope to resell some of your items for cash. You realize in horror that no one wants your things, even for free. This sucks. Your things are destined for a landfill, and you have to replace your things completely out of pocket.
2. Don’t declutter too strictly. I've really regretted it. I got rid of my blender because we needed more counter space and I have an immersion blender. Bad choice! I have needed a real blender several times, and I can't afford to buy a new one right now. This is the same story with several other items. Ironing board, trash cans, kitchen tool, etc. Think realistically about how much you actually use something. For me, a tiny food processor or an immersion blender isn't good enough for smoothies or large sauce batches, so I should've kept the blender and gotten rid of one of the smaller appliances. But, I also got rid of my coffee maker and haven't regretting it, because I can use my pour-over. 
3. Declutter more clothing. Yes, more than you already have. I got rid of so much clothing when we moved (way more than half my closet), and I've still had to pare down more. Even with our out-of-season clothes in storage at a family member's house, we still have too much clothing. I keep having to go through and get rid of more and more. You truly do not need as much clothing as you think you do.
4. Find a guideline for decluttering that works for you. Recently, I looked at every clothing tag and got rid of most of what wasn't natural fibers. I have been working on transitioning to a natural, second-hand wardrobe over the last two years, but I'd still been holding on to plastic pieces! Having the pressure from being in such a small space and having this rule helped me to declutter more easily. For you, this could be a similar guideline or something more along the lines of use, like clothing that fits you well or clothing appropriate to your season of life/career.
5. Organize efficiently. Don't go too specific with your organizers/containers, or you won't be able to reuse the. elsewhere when you move things around or declutter again. And, you don't have to go all out on this. Please don't go to the container store. Second-hand and Dollar Tree got me what I needed. Those 'locker shelves' have been lifesavers. Small wire bins, too. All of it has cost me less than $50 and has made RV life much easier.
6. Don’t keep too many dishes. Dishes take up a lot of space. The more dishes you have, the longer you can go without washing them, the more they will pile up in your sink. This is a great area to declutter. I pared down all my sets of 8 to sets of 4. I got rid of excess, my cheaper tupperware, duplicate mugs, niche bakeware, things that have broken, etc. When we have too many glass jars to use as cups or storage, I donate or recycle them. 
7. You only need one water bottle.
8. Start a no-buy season. Right now, we cannot afford to buy anything but essentials, which makes us question every single day, 'What are the essentials?' I think anyone who has experienced poverty has probably gone through this thought process. It forces you to do a no-spend, which is actually a good thing. Through being forced to spend very little, I am relearning what is 'essential.' I put things I want on a wishlist and save them for later. Usually, I no longer want the thing after a month or too.
9. Don’t buy food you won't eat. One of the things I had to declutter was my pantry. Panko bread crumbs used for one recipe, canned goods I bought during my doomsday phase, several bottles of lemon juice, coffee beans I couldn't grind, etc. And, no one wants these things! I gave a whole box of food to one person, only to discover later he left it outside. I gave some food to my mom, but she didn't want much of it. The rest, I either had to throw away (the opened things) or give to a food bank. Who knows what they kept. So, buy the food you know you will eat in a reasonable amount of time. Sure, it is good to have extras in case the grocery store is out or something, but you don't need too much (and, if you do prep, only buy the things you'd eat anyways, like beans or canned chicken). Also, if you just have to buy a weird ingredient for a recipe you want to try, make sure to find other recipes to use it up. Otherwise, you're just going to have to toss it in a year.
10. Make stuff from scratch rather buying sauces / condiments. Saves money and space.
11. Declutter your diet. Do you need seven different bags of chips open at the same time? Ten different types of sodas and energy drinks sitting in boxes? No. Choose one flavor at a time. Saves mental and physical space and forces you to finish things before buying the next.
12. Use your library. I used to buy books new and second-hand all the time. Now, I used the library and the app Libby to read for free without having to store a bunch of physical books. Also, digital declutter, anyone? I use the library for movies (Kanopy, Hoopla, and DVDs), as I 'decluttered' my streaming subscriptions. I still have some physical books and movies, but they are only the important ones. Some libraries also have free music streaming apps (Hoopla, Freegal). Also: find local college radio stations for unique, free music with minimal ads.
13. Store food that attracts bugs in air-tight containers or in plastic bags. My honey is in a ziploc bag, because I had to throw away two bottles from ants getting into them. It's not wasteful if it's saving food.
14. Invest in moisture control. Seriously. When we lived in an apartment, we had to throw out a lot of shoes and whatnot because of mold. It might not be minimalism, but you need a dehumidifier in your bathroom and those off-brand 'damp rid' tubs in other areas like cabinets and closets. A humidity reader is also good. Again, it is not exactly minimalist, but it saves waste and your health in the long run.
15. Declutter your junk drawer every month or two. This keeps it at bay and lets you know what you already have so you don't hoard or buy duplicates.
16. Similarly, know what is in your cabinets. I can't tell you how many times I’ve bought more lemon juice because I think I'm almost out only to discover two more bottles of lemon juice in the back of the cabinet. I've done this with spices, mustard, etc. Before shopping, go through your fridge and pantry to see what you already have. This is a good habit to form.
17. This may be harsh, but...Don't have pets. If you can avoid it, DO NOT have pets in a tiny living situation. All of their mess gets stuck in one little space, which amplifies it. When I lived in an apartment, having dogs didn't bother my allergies. Now, I am on allergy medicine 24/7. Plus, it is impossible to keep the RV clean of their fur. Plus, pets add to bills and clutter (toys, leashes, medicine, etc.). 
18. You only need one pair of oven mitts. Why does every mom have, like, thirty different oven mitts and pot holders?
19. Choose hobbies that don't take up a lot of storage space, or pare down to the essentials of your hobby. For me, with painting, that means only buying the basic colors and mixing them myself, buying canvases as I need them, and having one small set of brushes that I take good care of. For knitting or sewing, that means only having one project going at a time, which is harder than it sounds.
20. Skin care is a whole lot simpler than we make it out to be. You need a cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer. I use sensitive-skin bar soap, witch hazel, and jojoba oil. 
21. Throw out your expired makeup you've had since middle school.
22. Do you really need more than one or two nail polish colors at a time? More than one perfume at a time? Give the excess away.
23. Blankets. I love them, so this was a hard category to declutter. But, you only need a few. Give excess sentimental ones to family members, if you can. Donate the ones you don’t like as much to shelters or charity shops. Vacuum bag the out-of-season blankets to save space. Also: damaged blankets and pillows can go to pet shelters.
24. Bring your own tupperware to restaurants for leftovers. Not only is it less wasteful, it saves space in the fridge.
25. Go through your files at least once a year. I’m speaking of physical files, like saved mail, receipts, bills, paystubs, etc. You can get rid of most of the stuff that’s older than a year, as you no longer need it for taxes, proof of income, proof of address, etc. If you’re concerned about accidentally getting rid of something important, make it someone else’s problem AKA show up at your insurance agent’s office with the ridiculous stack of papers they’ve mailed you and have them help you parse through it. You could also switch to paperless. Sometimes, they’ll give you a discount for this.
26. As mentioned before, declutter your subscriptions. You don’t need an app for this. Make a list of the subscriptions you know you have and how much you pay, then check your bank accounts to see if you’ve missed anything. Think about what you can replace with the library resources, what you can borrow from a friend, and what you no longer use. Cancel those accounts. This has saved me so much money.
27. A steamer usually works instead of an iron and takes up less space than that and an ironing board. If you want to keep your iron but not the board, you can fold a cotton towel and iron on top of it. Or, get one of those tiny table-top ironing boards from a second-hand shop. They’re pretty easy to find.
28. Two words: Vertical storage. Hanging shoe racks, those locker shelves I mentioned, door hooks, cabinet door baskets, etc. Saves so much space and make it easier to see things so you don’t buy duplicates. 
29. You only need two towels per person and enough hand towels to get you through a week plus laundry day. Similarly, for rags, if you use them, you need one per person per day plus an extra or two. If you have pets, small children, or a husband, have a spare old dirty towel or two for cleaning up messes.
30. Cleaning products. I have two. I have one big jug of Sal’s Suds that I mix into a spray bottle that I use for everything: toilet, shower, sinks, mirrors, counters, floors, etc. For disinfecting surfaces, I have one container of wipes. That’s it. An all-purpose spray from concentrate and a disinfectant. ",22,1734554090.0,minimalism,1,0.97,False

I am busy keeping my baby fed, clean, entertained with toys and hanging out with her while juggling household chores and cooking while my husband works full time. He is a hands on dad so that part is good but at the end of the day I’m exhausted and even during the day I just want to do ‘nothing’ when I have the time if she’s napping.

1hhaqhn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hhaqhn,New-ish to moka,"Long story short: my espresso machine broke, so I thrifted a moka pot for under $10. There are no markings besides “made in Italy” (and that it’s made from stainless steel) on the bottom. I’ve googled but can’t seem to find the make or model. Any ideas what this is?

Second, I’ve used moka pots in the past, but this sub has really helped me understand the fine tuning of them, and I’m happy to report that I’m getting a really nice cup of coffee from it. My second question is that at the end of the brew, it sputters a lot and there’s a tiny small amount of water left in the bottom of the reservoir. Is this normal or should I be looking at a better (and new) moka pot to prevent that?

Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. And thanks already for the helpful guidance on this sub!

Hey there fellow travelers! I recently took a half-day trip to Muir Woods and Sausalito from San Francisco, and I just had to share my experience. If you're planning to visit the Bay Area, this is definitely something you won't want to miss.

I've been to San Francisco several times, but somehow always missed visiting these iconic spots. This time, I decided to make it happen and booked this tour: https://athometouch.com/MuirWoods

First off, the morning pickup from my hotel was super convenient. Our guide (shoutout to Mike!) was fantastic - knowledgeable, funny, and really passionate about the area's history and nature.

The star of the show was definitely Muir Woods. Walking among those ancient coastal redwoods was honestly breathtaking. Some of these giants are over 600 years old and reach heights of 250 feet! The morning timing was perfect - we beat the crowds and got to experience the forest's peaceful atmosphere. The fresh morning mist giving way to sunbeams filtering through the canopy was simply magical.

We spent about 1.5 hours exploring different trails, which was plenty of time to take photos and soak in the experience. Pro tip: wear comfortable walking shoes and bring a light jacket (it can be cool under the canopy).

Next up was Sausalito, and what a charming place! This Mediterranean-style coastal town is basically picture-perfect. We had 45 minutes to explore, which I spent browsing cute boutiques and grabbing coffee at one of the waterfront cafes. The views of San Francisco across the bay are incredible.

One of the cool options this tour offers is the choice to return by ferry instead of the coach. I highly recommend this - the bay views are stunning, especially of the Golden Gate Bridge (weather permitting).

Here's what I loved most about this tour:
- Hotel pickup/dropoff included
- All entrance fees covered
- Professional guide who actually knew their stuff
- Perfect timing to avoid crowds
- Flexible return options

If you're planning to do this tour (which you absolutely should), I'd recommend booking through this link: https://athometouch.com/MuirWoods. Their prices are competitive, and the booking process was super smooth.

For anyone on the fence about this tour - just do it. It's the perfect mix of nature and charm, and you'll get to see some of the Bay Area's most iconic spots in just half a day. Plus, it's way easier than trying to figure out transportation and parking on your own (trust me, I've been there).

Has anyone else done this tour? Would love to hear about your experiences in the comments!",1,1734553017.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False
1hhan8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1hhan8c/am_i_the_ah_for_setting_boundries_via_email_with/,Am I the AH for setting boundries via email with my sister-in-law who had already cut contact with half of the family?,"For a bit of back story, my(29F) husband (33M) has 1 brother(31M) who has a partner. They are not legally married yet but she did have our child's cousin in the same year that she was born and they've been together for as long as we have so we do refer to her as his wife. For this story I will call her Jade. We do not live in close proximity so whilst I have met my BIL I have not actually met Jade F2F. We became besties when we were both pregnant. Sharing tips,feelings and thoughts. We became extremely close. Once our babies were born she started to send gifts. I asked her to stop and had sent one for Xmas time for her son but I told her that we are struggling financially and I felt bad receiving gifts for the baby so often, if I couldn't repay the favor. It felt weird. I always felt like she wanted multiple thank you's as well. I could tell she liked that and figured it must just be her love language.
She had some issues with the BIL and went to therapy. We heard through her, that he was placing all his issues in child hood issues which were basic sibling rivalry  on my husband.  I didn't like this. She would also say things like ""did you know he stole this small thing when he was younger"" and I would say ""yes, he's my husband.  He was a child then. He gave it back and said sorry. I married him. I know these stories. Im sure everyone did things they aren't proud of when they were younger"" and it felt like she kept putting him down. I also noticed that she would try to cut my MIL out of my BIL's life by saying all the things she hates about her. I often ended up defending each of them when in conversation with the other. BIL really wasn't allowed to speak to his mom or see her. BIL came down to our city and went for dinner with us. I had been asked by SIL to please ensure 2 of their cousins were not at this dinner as she heard they were a bad influence but they wouldnt have done anything at a simple dinner. They didnt end up knowing about the dinner. BIL came back for coffee after at our house. He asked me not to tell SIL because apparently she would be upset. I'm not sure why as coffee was a good idea before heading home but that was one of the many first redflags 🚩 
Over time, one by one, other family members noticed her behavior and didn't want to be close to her. I later found out this is why she hated me, because everyone had an issue with her and not me.
They started arranging to move to a whole new city and in the process she had made some remarks which escalated as I was in a dark place and asked her to stop picking on my husband. She didn't stop. I nlocked her on text and she started bombarding me in social media where I told her to leave us alone and she then didn't speak to us again...for a while. After mistreating other family during their moving process, they finally moved and we didn't hear much  other than all the stories that were hidden whilst they were here e.g. she was comparing our children's milestones to other family members even though I didn't care and their child was quite a few months older. She was mad at us for not inviting her down to see us with the grandparents when the grandparents arranged to come see us and we didn't even know she was staying with them temporarily. She had Facebook and from when we were friends she always said she never had it and I could never find her under search so she must have secretly hated me as a threat and blocked me before I could be nice and add her. She really hated us.

Now to today's issue. She's been creating a family tree online, great. I don't mind. She added us. I didn't mind that either. She added a photo of my kid. THAT, I minded and I removed it. She did it again using a photo sent to a grandparent in private and obviously shared with that side of the family without realising what it was for.  I removed it. We keep our socials pri ate and don't out our child online so I was not keen on this. I don't even share a contact number without permission from the person. I got a notification and she has used my husband and my social profile photos as ours as the katest update, added a photo from a private Facebook album of us kissing on the day we got married to the family photos which I am not keen on as these family trees go past your 2000th relative (not so private after all) and then I see she's added my uncles, aunties, their adult kids who all have private or NO socials so I am not sure how she found them, and my cousins small children's full names to the tree!! My family are private people and these are in no way her family really so I found this inappropriate. Questioning myself for a moment,  I checked and between 2 days this year SHE added them and not me. My mother is furious. I screenshot each profile and deleted them one by one. 

I told my MIL and my mom the entire story and created an email stating that my boundries are clear and that this is actually creepy. I told her ti never do this again without any family member's consent as I'm not the only one finding these actions weird and having it happen to them and that when  I said years ago to leave me alone  I meant it.

My husband received a text from BIL stating they were having a wedding next year and thanks to my email  we now won't be invited- it's a destination wedding with 40k tickets one way so we wouldn't go anyway!!! He said I ""attacked her"" by calling her creepy and that she's works hard on the tree but of course it's hard to find family members who you shouldn't even have access to. I had no issue with her tree  just stop the branch at my name for my side.  BIL also said our child's photos that were used were already public but they weren't. I doubt he's aware a grandparent sent it to her to begin with. It seems, she never really showed him the email I sent. And yes. My husband and did proofread it before I sent it which is why I was shocked when my husband got so upset at the text which we knew to maybe expect and he stormed out and now won't talk to me this evening. So AITH for setting boundries to protect me and my family's children within my rights or should I have removed them quietly and carried on doing this for years because she will do it again, in order to keep the peace. Is this not harassment to some extent as well? Also, she is aware I get the notification when she adds people or males changes on the tree so I think she may have manipulated the entire situation to make me seem like the bad guy and have a reason to make my BIL cut off my husband  the same way he did to his mom and his step mom.",1,1734553006.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

I make a good living wage but can’t seem to keep up because every year my rent goes up $500. 

Originally it was $500, then my sister who controls my dad’s income(he makes $140k a year/$2500 mortgage) had another kid. She’s a stay at home mom who just buys $10 teas instead of coffee($210 weekly), constantly has Amazon packages coming in, buys high ticket items every month($1800 Mac desktop, $900 MacBook etc etc) most recently bought a $3000 dog and $1500 in dog accessories half of it she needs to return but won’t because it takes effort 

Ever since then, the rent kept going up from $500, 750, 1250 now it’s about to $1500 to keep up with her lifestyle of spending I find that I’m having a hard time saving money/paying off my debt. He refuses to speak up to my sister about her spending his money, because she will just threaten to take away his grandchildren.

I can get by with the rent but coming up with a first, last and security for an apartment that’s mine seems not tangible yet and I’m trying to find a way out. She does everything for him and makes up his own decisions, it’s extremely dysfunctional and I need to get out ASAP. I work 60-70 hours a week. That’ll cut down to 55-60 if I’m lucky with the upcoming winter.

I’m thinking at this point it might be better just to live inside my truck for a few months to save/rebuild my credit in order to move forward with my life. Am I being overdramatic about this? Any other direction I could go in?",2,1734552927.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

I haven't yet met her in person, and I don't know what her voice sounds like. I had one of my female coworkers help me find a coffee shop.

I'm 43 years old and I haven't been on a date in more than 20 years. In 2015 my father died unexpectedly, which left me numb and emotionally stunted. I spent most of my 30s struggling with my mental health and self-confidence, at first unemployed, then stuck in a job which wasn't going anywhere in a town where I didn't make any friends.

This year everything changed, and I finally feel like I'm in a position where I'm valued, where I'm part of a professional community, and where people know who I am. The pay is also generous.
