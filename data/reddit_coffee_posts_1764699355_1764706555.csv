I don’t know how to process this.","Hi everyone. I’m a f26, and I need some outside perspective because I feel emotionally overwhelmed and unsure if I’m overreacting. 

Yesterday, I invited my parents over for breakfast. Everything was calm and cozy in the beginning — we were talking about my recent trip to Bali, and I mentioned how kind and grateful the people there are, even though they don’t have much. My mom asked if we helped anyone financially, and I said we helped where we could.

Out of nowhere she shifted the whole conversation and told me that I never help her. She said I only think about myself, that I never help her financially, and brought up an example about a time I bought her some underwear she asked me for. She said that because I told her the price and she transferred me the money, I should have refused the payment and just given them to her. She basically said I should have shown “more humility,” whatever that means.

The whole atmosphere changed instantly. I got quiet because it hurt and confused me — it felt so unfair and unprovoked. She could see I was upset, and instead of calming down, she got angry that I was still sad about it after 5 minutes. She didn’t drink her coffee and basically stormed out the door, leaving me shocked and feeling small, guilty, and sick inside.

This kind of behavior from her isn’t new. I grew up with this. Suddenly turning on me, humiliating me, getting angry if I show emotions, making everything my fault. I’ve always had a more secure and calm relationship with my dad, so I was also sad that he just left with her because I had been looking forward to seeing him.

I called her many times and she didn’t pick up. She had a habit of “punishment” when she gets angry. Today, I called her again because I wanted to repair things. I didn’t blame her - I just apologized because I didn’t want the tension. The moment she picked up, she started scolding me again. She said I “kicked her out” yesterday because, in her mind, I should have stopped her from leaving. She expected me to physically stop her or beg her to stay. I froze yesterday because I went into shock, but she didn’t care, i tried to tell her my version but she didn’t care. She called me many bad names and kept going. 

While she was yelling today, I started having a panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, I was shaking, crying, saying “I’m sorry” over and over just to make her stop. She didn’t stop. Even after my panic attack, she kept scolding me. In the end we hang up. She has never seen me have a panic attack before - she doesn’t know I have anxiety. 

Now I’m left feeling emotionally drained, shaky, guilty, sad, and honestly a bit traumatized. My body feels like I’m still in that fear-state. I know this isn’t normal behavior, but I don’t know how to fully process it because this is how she has always been with me since childhood. I work as a social worker, because I don’t want children to grow up like I did. Now i’m even thinking of taking a sick day because i’m scared that this + work stress will end it a long term sick leave. 

I don’t want to cut her off, but I also don’t know how to keep myself safe emotionally when she behaves like this.

How do I deal with a mother who reacts like a child, punishes with guilt, rewrites reality, and doesn’t stop even when I’m having an actual panic attack?
And how do I calm my body after something like this?",1,1764706478.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False

Anyone else hitting that mid-afternoon wall HARD these days? 😴 I swear, lately, my energy levels have been resembling a dial-up connection... slow and frustrating! And honestly, the thought of another cup of coffee makes my stomach churn.

So, I've been experimenting, and I wanted to share a few things that are actually helping me feel less like a sloth and more like… well, a slightly less-tired sloth, haha! Seriously though, small changes can make a big difference, right?

Here's what's been working for me:

*   **Hydration, Hydration, Hydration!** Seriously, are you drinking enough water? Dehydration is a HUGE energy zapper. I started carrying a water bottle everywhere and it’s a game changer. Who knew?!
*   **Move Your Body!** I know, I know... easier said than done. But even a 10-minute walk around the block works wonders. Think of it as shaking off the cobwebs instead of a grueling workout. Remember when we used to climb stairs and thought nothing of it? Now, it's a workout! 😂
*   **Power Naps (the RIGHT way):** Forget those hour-long snoozes that leave you feeling groggier than before. Aim for 20-30 minutes. It's like a mini reboot for your brain. Seriously!
*   **Mindful Eating:** I've noticed a HUGE difference when I ditch the sugary snacks and focus on whole, unprocessed foods. Think fruits, veggies, nuts...the good stuff! (okay, maybe a *little* dark chocolate too 😉)
*   **Sunlight!** Even on cloudy days, getting some natural light can help regulate your sleep-wake cycle. Open those blinds! Step outside for a few minutes! Feel that vitamin D flow!
*   **Small bursts of joy!** Listen to a favorite song. Read a few pages of that book you've been neglecting. Call a friend. Sometimes, just a little bit of joy can recharge your batteries more than you think.
*   **Setting small, achievable goals.** Instead of feeling overwhelmed with a huge project, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Getting that small win really gives you a boost!

And speaking of feeling good... remember that inner strength we all possess? Sometimes we just need a little nudge to rediscover it. We believe in strongest people. If you are looking to find your stronger self, check out these amazing products: [https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb)

It's all a work in progress, right? I'm definitely not perfect. Some days, I still need that extra coffee (or two!). But incorporating these little things has made a noticeable difference.

What about you? What are your go-to strategies for kicking that sluggish feeling to the curb? Any secrets you're willing to share with your fellow RetirementReady peeps? I’m all ears!

1pcj3g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1pcj3g1/rent_reduction_how_much_should_i_ask_for/,Rent reduction - how much should I ask for?,"I have lived in my current BK apartment with my girlfriend for 16 months. Since our first month we have had issues with mice, roaches, exposed wires, unstable stairs, and a leaking roof. I have photo/video evidence of mice and roaches in our apartment from nearly every month. My girlfriend has been woken up in the middle of the night to cockroaches crawling on here twice. We have video of mice running through our apartment during the middle of the day. We live on the top floor and our ceiling leaks in our living room, staining our rug and the wood on our coffee table. Each repair is only temporary and inevitably the leak occurs again. This current leak has been ongoing since late October with our landlord not acting fast enough to fix. The landlord refuses recommendations by exterminators to address the mice and roach issue. I only communicate with her in writing and have plentiful evidence of her ignoring professionals and trying to do things her way, unsuccessfully.  

I’ve filed 5 issues with 311 this week and demanded our landlord reduce our rent. She has asked how much we want to reduce it by. For context, the previous tenant paid 33% less and there were no improvements between leases. 

How much of a reduction should I ask for? ",1,1764706346.0,AskNYC,2,1.0,False

We keep coming back to the idea of a sailing week in Croatia. We make good money, so we can afford a more expensive vacation. We’re not looking for nightlife or packed beaches; we just want calm water, beautiful nature, good food, and a chance to actually disconnect and spend time together.  
  
We considered a couple of companies, but I think we'll go with [goxperience-sailing.com](https://goxperience-sailing.com). It's all-inclusive, so I don't have to worry about anything. They offer a 51-ft yacht with meals, drinks, snorkelling, paddle boarding, and the crew adjusts the route depending on weather and the guests' preferences. The idea of waking up in secluded bays and having coffee on deck sounds unreal.  
  
Anyone else who’s done a sailing trip to Croatia? Is the weather warm enough in June? Also, I'd love to hear your sailing stories if you're willing to share.

I met my bio dad about 10 years ago he was at first, very open and confirmed that I was his biological daughter. We arranged to meet for coffee when he was in the country (he is a pilot living abroad) where he made it clear he spoke to his wife and was not my father. I was never going into our meeting hoping for a relationship and generally had low expectations of his character so wasn’t hugely impacted by his change of tune.

I am slightly disappointed as I am interested in his heritage and will always have that blank side of my family tree, I am also now a mum to 2 kids which makes it feel a little more fresh and he has other kids so knowing I have half siblings out there too will always intrigue me.

The first date was a coffee walking date. He had brought along some coffee, but it had dairy milk in it which I don't like the taste of, so I bought my own coffee. 

Second date, we had dinner and drinks at a very expensive restaurant and he paid what would have been a significant bill. I really appreciated that. 

The third date we split the bill.

I know there are several schools of thought on who pays for what on dates. My personal preference and what makes me feel good is when a guy pays for the first couple of dates, And if we continue to date, then I would pay...BUT if a man is earning a good salary, I would be expecting him to pay more than me, with me paying 1/3 of the time, and me showing my generosity in other ways (gestures, surprise tickets to something, etc.). 

The energy of generosity is very important to me, because I'm generous and thoughtful to a fault - I am a very caring partner from all aspects. I give in full force, not just to my man, but in general. I also come from a culture where men pay. I have always been taken care of by the men around me, and so 50/50 culture has never felt right, even though I understand it intellectually.

1pciysq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pciysq/i_bought_a_used_dashcam_from_a_garage_sale_the_sd/,"I bought a used dashcam from a garage sale. The SD card wasn't wiped, and the last recording shows a drive down a road that doesn't exist.","I have a rule about garage sales: never buy electronics. You’re usually buying someone else’s broken toaster, a blender that smells like burning hair, or a ""vintage"" gaming console that's really just a roach motel with a power cord. I stick to books, cast-iron skillets, and the occasional tool that looks like it was forged before planned obsolescence became a business model.

But the sign was hand-painted on jagged cardboard—*ESTATE SALE: EVERYTHING MUST GO*—and it was stapled to a telephone pole in Silver Creek. For those who don't know, Silver Creek is where the doctors and lawyers live. It’s the kind of neighborhood where the HOA measures your grass with a ruler and the trash cans are hidden behind tastefully designed lattice fences. If there was a garage sale here, it wasn't junk. It was an offloading of high-end assets. So, I broke my rule.

I pulled my beat-up Civic onto the street, feeling distinctly out of place among the parked BMWs and Land Rovers. The house was a sprawling mid-century modern, the kind with too much glass and sharp, aggressive angles. It looked like a villain’s lair from a 70s spy movie. But the vibe was wrong immediately.

Usually, estate sales in places like this are run by professionals—cold women in blazers with clipboards who price used towels at twenty dollars. This wasn't that. There were no tables set up. No organization. Just plastic storage bins tossed haphazardly onto the pristine concrete of the driveway, their lids ripped off.

A man was sitting in a metal folding chair near the open garage door. He looked like he was vibrating. He was maybe fifty, wearing a polo shirt that had been expensive once but was now stained with sweat and coffee. He hadn't shaved in days. His eyes were darting around the cul-de-sac, tracking the movement of the squirrels, the rustle of leaves.

He didn't look like a homeowner having a sale. He looked like a man waiting for a bomb to go off.

I walked up the driveway, my shoes scuffing loudly on the concrete. He jumped, his chair scraping harsh and loud.

“Anything in particular?” he asked. His voice was wet and raspy, like he’d been screaming into a pillow.

“Just looking,” I said, trying to keep my voice casual. “Saw the sign.”

He nodded, dragging a hand down his face. “Take whatever. Prices are... negotiable. I just need it clear. The house closes on Tuesday.”

I started digging. It was a weird mix. High-end kitchen gadgets thrown in with tangled extension cords. A box of expensive watches next to half-used cleaning supplies. It felt less like a sale and more like a looting.

I found the camera at the bottom of a bin filled with ethernet cables.

It was a NextBase 622GW. Top of the line. 4K recording, night vision, image stabilization—the works. Retail, this thing was easily four hundred bucks. It looked brand new, the plastic film still on the rear screen.

I held it up. “How much for the dashcam?”

The man’s head snapped up. His eyes locked onto the black device in my hand, and for a second, his face went completely slack. All the nervous energy drained out, replaced by a hollow, terrifying stillness. He looked at that camera the way you’d look at a loaded gun pointed at your stomach.

“Take it,” he whispered.

“I mean, give me a number,” I said, reaching for my wallet. “Twenty? Fifty?”

He stood up. He walked over to me, invading my personal space. He smelled of stale bourbon and fear. He closed his hand over mine, pushing the camera into my chest.

“Five bucks,” he hissed. “Just take it. Take it and go.”

I pulled a five-dollar bill from my pocket. He snatched it, not even looking at the denomination, and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he turned his back on me and walked into the dark garage.

“Sale’s over,” he called out from the shadows. “Get off the property.”

I didn't argue. I walked back to my car, tossed the camera onto the passenger seat, and got the hell out of Silver Creek. As I pulled away, I glanced in my rearview mirror. He was back in the driveway, watching me leave. He wasn't counting the money. He wasn't organizing his bins. He was just standing there, watching my car disappear around the bend.

He looked relieved.

I got home around four. I cracked a beer, ordered a pizza, and decided to inspect my haul. The camera felt heavy in my hand, substantial. I turned it over. The SD card slot was occupied. I pushed it, and a 64GB SanDisk card popped out.

*Score,* I thought. *Free storage.*

I booted up my laptop. I figured I’d format the card, update the firmware, and install it in my Civic. Maybe catch some insurance scammers or a meteor. I slotted the SD card into the reader.

A folder popped up on my screen: `DCIM`.

Inside were three subfolders: `PROTECTED`, `PARKING`, and `VIDEO`.

I checked the properties. The card was nearly full. 58 gigabytes of data. The guy hadn't wiped it.

I hovered my mouse over the `FORMAT` button. I should have clicked it. I should have scrubbed it clean right then and there. But human curiosity is a defect. It’s the glitch in our survival instinct. I wanted to know what kind of guy sells a four-hundred-dollar camera for five bucks. Was he hiding something? An affair? A crime?

I opened the `VIDEO` folder.

There were hundreds of files. I clicked a few from the top of the list, dated three years ago.

*Clip 001:* A drive through a car wash. *Clip 002:* Waiting in line at a Starbucks drive-thru. The audio picked up the driver ordering a black coffee and a croissant. His voice was normal, calm. *Clip 003:* A commute down I-95 in the rain.

It was boring. Painfully mundane. I scrubbed through months of footage. It was just the life of a suburban dad. Grocery runs. Dropping a kid off at soccer practice. Commuting. The guy was a careful driver. He used his turn signals. He stopped fully at stop signs.

I sat back, sipping my beer. ""Okay, buddy,"" I muttered. ""You're boring. Why the fire sale?""

I scrolled down, looking for the recent stuff. Maybe the crash that ruined his nerves?

The dates were consistent. Daily drives, usually two or three clips a day. Until October of this year.

October 14th was the last normal clip. It was a drive home at sunset. Beautiful lighting. He pulls into the driveway of the mid-century modern house. The garage door opens. He pulls in. End of clip.

Then, there was a gap.

No videos for six weeks.

The next file was dated yesterday. **December 1st**.

I clicked it.

The camera view was different. It wasn't mounted on the windshield anymore. It looked like it was sitting on a dashboard, unmounted, sliding slightly with the movement of the car. The hood of the car was visible—it wasn't the clean white BMW from the previous clips. It was rusted, red paint peeling in strips.

The audio was just heavy breathing.

*Hhhhuuh. Hhhhuuh.*

The car was parked in front of a woodshed I didn't recognize. It was night, but the headlights cut a cone through the darkness. A man walked into the frame. It was the seller.

He looked bad. Even worse than he had today. He was holding a shovel. He walked to the edge of the woods, dug a shallow hole, and threw something in. It was small. Maybe the size of a shoebox. He filled the hole, patted it down with the shovel, and stood there for a long time, staring at the dirt.

Then he turned and looked at the car. At the camera.

He didn't look sad. He looked hateful. He walked up to the windshield and screamed something, but the glass muffled it. It sounded like, *""Not enough.""*

He slammed his fist on the hood, and the video cut.

""Jesus,"" I whispered. I felt like I was watching a breakdown in real-time. This guy was losing it.

I looked at the file list again. There was one more video.

It was at the very bottom.

**File Name:** `2025_12_03_170042.MP4` **Date:** 12/03/2025 **Time:** 5:00 PM

I frowned. I looked at the clock on my laptop taskbar.

It was **December 2nd**. 8:45 PM.

""Okay,"" I said, trying to rationalize it. ""System clock glitch. The battery died in the camera and it reset the date. Happens all the time.""

But deep down, a cold worm of unease curled in my stomach. The date wasn't reset to 1970 or 2000, like a default glitch. It was set to *tomorrow*.

I almost closed the folder. I almost ejected the card. But I didn't.

I double-clicked the file.

The video player opened. Black screen.

For the first ten seconds, there was no video. Just audio.

It was a sound I couldn't place. It sounded like wind, but heavy. Viscous. Like air moving through liquid. And underneath it, a low, rhythmic thrumming. *Thrum... thrum... thrum.*

Then, the video snapped on.

I gasped.

The camera was mounted in the rusted red car again. It was idling in a driveway.

*My* driveway.

I paused the video. I leaned in until my nose touched the screen. I scanned every pixel, looking for a discrepancy. A difference.

There was my Civic, parked in its usual spot. There was the oil stain I’d meant to power wash for months. There was the cracked recycling bin the garbage men had tossed last week.

It was my apartment complex. No doubt.

But the world looked sick.

The sky wasn't black, and it wasn't blue. It was a flat, bruised purple, like a hematoma spreading across the skin of the world. There were no stars. No moon. Just that suffocating, violet light that cast no shadows.

The trees... the oak tree in the front yard that I parked under every day... it was white. Not covered in snow. The bark itself was pale and slick, like wet bone. And it wasn't moving. There was no wind in this purple world, yet the audio track was roaring with that viscous rushing sound.

I checked the timestamp on the video. *17:00:42*.

Tomorrow. 5:00 PM.

I hit play.

The rusted car backed out of my spot. The movement was eerily smooth. No vibration from the engine. The car didn't sound like a combustion engine; it sounded like a choir of deep, discordant hums.

The car turned onto my street. Usually, at 5:00 PM on a Wednesday, this road is a parking lot. Commuters, buses, kids on bikes.

In the video, the street was dead.

The asphalt was cracked and overgrown with gray, wire-like weeds. The apartment buildings were dark. Windows were blown out or boarded up with that same bone-white wood.

The driver turned left. Toward the highway on-ramp.

I know this drive. I do it every day. You turn left, you hit the light at 4th Street, you get on I-95.

In the video, the driver turned left, and the city ended.

There was no 4th Street. No traffic light. No I-95.

The road simply dissolved into packed, black earth that cut straight through a forest of those massive, bone-white trees. They stretched up endlessly, twisting into the purple sky.

I felt like I was going to throw up. I paused the video again. I paced around my room. This had to be a fake. An elaborate CGI prank. The guy at the sale was a VFX artist, right? He modeled my apartment complex, rendered it, and put it on the card to mess with whoever bought it.

""That's crazy,"" I said aloud. ""That's insane.""

But it was the only explanation that didn't make me want to scream.

I sat back down. I had to see where it went.

I hit play.

The car accelerated down the black dirt road. The speedometer in the corner of the dashcam display climbed. 40 mph. 60. 80. The white trees blurred into a wall of pale ribs.

The audio grew louder. The rushing wind sound was joined by voices. Whispers. They were layered over each other, thousands of them, speaking too fast to understand. It sounded like a stadium full of people praying in a language that required too many tongues.

*Thrum... thrum... thrum.*

The car drove for twenty minutes. The road didn't curve. It didn't dip. It was a straight line into the heart of the purple void.

Then, abruptly, the car slammed on the brakes.

The camera shuddered. The car skidded to a halt in a cloud of black dust.

We were in a clearing. The trees formed a perfect circle around a single structure.

It was a garage.

But it wasn't a normal garage. It was built from the white trees, the logs slick and wet looking. The door was a gaping maw of darkness.

The car rolled forward. Slowly. Reluctantly.

It entered the garage. The purple light vanished, replaced by the grainy green glow of the camera's night vision kicking in.

The space was tight. The walls were lined with tools. But not mechanics' tools.

Huge, rusted hooks hanging on chains. Saws with serrated teeth the size of fingers. Tables covered in dark, wet tarps.

The car engine cut. The thrumming stopped. The whispers ceased.

Silence.

The timestamp read *17:28:10*.

For a full minute, nothing moved. I stared at the static, waiting for a jump scare. Waiting for a monster to jump out of the shadows.

Then, the driver moved.

A hand came into the frame to adjust the rearview mirror.

I stopped breathing.

The hand was wrong. It had three fingers. The pinky and ring finger were gone, not cut off, but *unformed*, the hand narrowing to a grotesque, bird-like claw. The skin was gray and scaled, like a lizard’s.

But on the wrist was a watch.

*My* watch. A cheap Casio with a scratched face that I’ve worn since college.

The hand tilted the mirror.

I saw the driver's eyes.

I scrambled backward, my chair tipping over, crashing to the floor. I crawled away from the laptop until my back hit the far wall.

""No,"" I whimpered. ""No, no, no.""

The face in the mirror was mine.

But it had been hollowed out. The skin was pulled tight over the skull, translucent and gray. The hair was gone. The nose was just two slits in the center of the face.

But the eyes... they were mine. They were human. And they were wide, frantic, filled with a terror so absolute it transcended sanity.

The thing wearing my face stared into the lens. It was crying. Thick, black tears leaked from the human eyes, rolling down the gray, alien skin.

Its mouth opened. It didn't have lips. Just a slit that tore open.

It mouthed a word.

*Help.*

Then, the thing smiled. But it wasn't the driver smiling. It was the skin *around* the mouth pulling back, like a puppet being manipulated. A wide, wet, impossible grin that split the face nearly in two.

The driver’s hand—the three-fingered claw—raised up. It pointed.

Not at the camera.

It pointed *behind* the camera. Toward the back seat of the car.

The video cut to black.

I sat there on the floor for a long time. My apartment was silent. The only sound was the whirring of my laptop fan.

I needed to do something. I needed to verify this. I needed to prove it was a fake.

I stood up, my legs shaking. I grabbed my keys. I was going to drive back to Silver Creek. I was going to find that man, grab him by his polo shirt, and make him tell me how he made the video. I was going to make him admit it was a sick joke.

I ran out to my car. The night air was cold and real. The stars were there. The moon was there.

I drove like a maniac. I ran two red lights. I made it to Silver Creek in fifteen minutes.

I turned onto the cul-de-sac.

I slammed on the brakes.

The house was gone.

The mid-century modern house, the driveway, the garage—it was all gone. In its place was an empty, overgrown lot. The grass was waist-high. A rotting ""FOR SALE"" sign lay face down in the dirt, so bleached by the sun it was unreadable.

I got out of the car. I walked onto the lot. The concrete foundation was there, cracked and covered in moss. There were scorch marks on the cement.

The house hadn't just been sold. It had burned down. Years ago.

I stood there in the dark, my mind reeling. I had been here *today*. I had bought the camera *here*. I saw the man. I touched his hand.

I looked down at the dashcam, still clutching it in my sweaty hand.

If the house burned down years ago... who sold me the camera? And where did I really go this afternoon?

I drove home in a daze. I didn't turn on the radio. I kept checking the rearview mirror, expecting to see... something.

I got back to my apartment complex. I parked in my spot. I looked at the oil stain. I looked at the neighbor's gnome. It was all normal.

I walked up to my door. I unlocked it. I went inside and locked the deadbolt, then the chain, then I wedged a chair under the handle.

I sat down at my desk. I looked at the timestamp on the video file one last time.

**12/03/2025. 17:00:42.**

I looked at my phone.

**11:58 PM. December 2nd.**

Two minutes to midnight.

I’m posting this now because I don't know what else to do. I’m holding a kitchen knife, but my hand is shaking so bad I might drop it.

Because I hear it.

Outside my window.

It started faint, but it's getting louder.

A low, resonant *thrum*.

Like a heavy bass note played two rooms away.

I’m crawling to the window now. I have to look. I have to know.

I’m pulling back the blinds.

There’s a car in my driveway.

It’s a rusted red sedan with peeling paint. It’s idling. The headlights are off, but I can see the silhouette of the driver.

The streetlights just went out. All of them.

And the sky...

God, the sky is turning purple.",2,1764706055.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1pciyla,https://www.reddit.com/r/surrendered_wife/comments/1pciyla/not_sure_what_to_dodissociation_and_unhinged/,Not sure what to do-dissociation and unhinged thoughts about husband and coworker,"So I am experiencing anxiety right now because my husband's former coworker reached out to him to meet up when she is in the area after Christmas. They don't speak often and meet up once a year for coffee. They worked together very closely for 10 years due to the fact they were colleagues in the same role. I have crippling anxiety and abandonment issues. Their relationship triggers those feelings severely. Yesterday before I got home I had an emotional spiral with ruminations that wouldn't stop. This made my anxiety spike and I checked his phone (which I have been very good about not doing for a while) and then I saw the text message. I know that this isn't a good behavior, but it was a moment of weakness for me. Last night I had extreme panic and wrote 5 pages of self-loathing statements. Think of it it like this-imagine you have such severe emotional pain that is like pressure building up in a volcano. Writing down all of this is a way for me to purge that pain-to take it out of myself. The problem is that is where I left off. Nothing is resolved-he will most likely meet with her and I have to just stay quiet about it. I know I need to focus on self-care. However, in the meantime I am having horrible anxiety and I am splitting on him and his friend. I feel low-level rage. What do you do when self-care doesn't even seem accessible because you are just trying to hold your shit together?

EDIT: Essentially I am trying to practice great self-control right now because when I get this way it is very hard for me to either not be passive aggressive, or worse, lash out in a rage. Does anyone else experience this?",2,1764706042.0,surrendered_wife,0,1.0,False

I actually enjoy taking  care of the house and our daughter, but my husband (26M) makes me feel like I am his mother not his wife. He has selective hearing, if I'm not yelling at him to do something he won't do it and even when I do raise my voice at him to do something he throws the fact that he has a job and I ""don't""

I gave birth to our  baby girl 4 months ago and I 'm still going through postpartum stuff. He still hasn't lifted a finger around the house or with our daughter. The most he does is give her a bottle or “watch her” while I shower, but even then he’s just playing video games while she’s crying on the bed.

I went to him mom she tried to talk some sense into him but it just went in one ear and out the other, so.. I did something that I am ashamed of but it really opened my eyes.

 I told him a week in advance that he would have to watch her while I run errands with my mother and he agreed. On the day I walked out that door at 7am but instead I went for a coffee and went to the spa to have a ""me day"" and it was the best I ever felt in a long time. I came back around 11am and exactly what I feared happened.

He did nothing besides feed her and she had poop running up her backside and I asked him how long ago she pooped and he told me about an hour after I left.

Meaning my daughter sat in a dirty diaper for four hours because he “doesn’t do diapers.”

We had a heated argument over it and I told him he wasn't acting like her father and again he throws the fact that I'm not working in my face as an excuse for diaper duty to be on me.

I’ve finally saved up enough to seriously consider fixing my teeth (mostly some crowding and one rotated tooth that drives me crazy). I’ve had a consult, but before I pull the trigger and drop the money, I wanted to hear from real people, not just the sales pitch at the ortho.

I’m a total newbie to this. I never had braces as a kid. My main worries are:

1. **The Lisp:** Does everyone get it? How long does it stick around? I talk a lot for work.
2. **The ""Diet"":** I’m a snacker/coffee drinker. Is taking them out 5 times a day going to drive me insane?
3. **Pain:** Is it a constant ache or just tight for a day or two?

Honest opinions wanted: Did you ever have ""buyer's remorse"" in the middle of treatment? And looking back, are you glad you did it?

There's letters and words on the page, but I'm not comprehending it. In the middle of the coffee shop I start freaking out because I'm having a stroke. I go back a submission and can read that.

I don't speak French. I never gave any indication that I speak French. Hell, if you ask the students, I barely speak English. All interaction with this student has been in English -- emails and conversations. In fact, I've had 2 in person interactions with the student since and there was no mention about doing the exam in French.

Maybe the student had something going on during the exam. But the answers will get a 0. If the student pushes back, they'll need to appeal to the school. I need the school to tell me I need to grade foreign language handwritten exams. I'm sure the union will have something to say about that.

Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, these low carb snickerdoodles are everything you love about a great keto cookie! The toasty coating of cinnamon & sweetener makes these keto snickerdoodle cookies simply perfect with a cup of coffee!  Cookies are my absolute favorite sweet treat.  Mostly because I like their portability, built in portion control (unless you eat all of them. . . not that I'd know from experience ?,) and the fact that you can eat multiple keto cookies of different kinds without committing to one large  a person who likes to try a bite of everything, low carb cookies are my dessert  year I put together a collection of 30 of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, and now I'm adding a few more to the blog for you to try - starting with these low carb snickerdoodles! Like all of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, these are pretty easy to make! A bonus because when I start thinking I could go for a cookie, I like to be eating said keto cookie within 30 minutes or less.  ???

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have!

Here’s what I ate today (being full honest):

Breakfast: 1 egg, 1 almond croissant, 1 cup of coffee

Lunch(I ate out): Stir-fry glass noodles with chicken and veggies, 1 cup of boba tea

Evening snack: Half a bag of Cheetos (ate very mindfully)

Dinner: Stir-fry soba with spinach, mushrooms, seaweed, and chicken, 1 cup of sparkling drink

No post-dinner snack! I tried this tip I saw in a video: pause and sit for 5 minutes after your meal. The urge to snack faded away for me and it did work for me! For anyones that is struggling please give it a try, it might help you too.

If you’re struggling with overeating or BED, how are you doing today? Even if you binged, did you binge less than last time? Did you manage to pause a bit longer than before even if its just few minutes? Remember small progress counts!

It started about a year ago where I would get extremely nauseous and horrific abdominal pain almost daily. Stool always came out powdery or pure liquid (ew) I would also have spells of vomiting, usually in the mornings. 

I was tested for MANY things, gastoparesis came back as normal, stool elastase came back normal, CT abdominal scans came back normal, colonoscopy and endoscopy came back normal. I did decide to take it upon myself to do an exclusion diet and found that dairy GREATLY upsets me, as does energy drinks and alcohol. But not black coffee weirdly. 

A couple months ago they gave me a sample of PERTZYE and it helped GREATLY. There was a moment where i wasnt able to have some as I had some insurance issues and i could absolutely tell the difference. Now, (thanks to insurance) im on Creon, but it thankfully helps the same. 

Since the pertzye and creon helped so much they told me I had EPI, did the abdominal CT just in case, and I went on my way. Im just wondering… is pancreatic exocrines helping really enough to be diagnosed?? Ive honestly noticed recently my symptoms are starting to degrade again, but not enough for me to make another appointment that will take months to even get me in. Im thinking its because ive been drinking more energy drinks as of recent.

3. Go to ""File"" ""Place"" and select the picture I want to past.

4. Size the picture into the size of the text block I placed the picture on. 

5. Then select the ""Text Wrap"" menu item, and set the margins around the picture.

Now come the problem.  If I look at the page next to the one I'm working on I have several problems:

a. The text don't always line up.  I try to keep the bottom of the text flush with the bottom line for the page layout, but this isn't always the case.  So I start messing with the margins around the picture or raising or lowering the picture on the page.

Hopefully you can see the 2 blue grid lines showing the text positioning mismatch and the fact that the text isn't aligned to the bottom of the page boundary at the bottom of page 19

Q1. Should I be adjusting the size of the text box to fit under/over the  picture?

Q2. Is there a preferred way to do this?

  
TIA - I look forward to learning from the pros.

1pcijz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pcijz7/recommendations_in_the_netherlands/,Recommendations in the Netherlands,"Hi all! 

I’ve been enjoying pour over coffee for a while now. I mostly went for filter roast beans from local roasters, but lately I’ve been ordering some beans via the internet. And with one particular bean, my mind was quite blown. Bean in question is a decaf light roast from Amsterdam’s Friedhats. Quite well known here in the Netherlands.

Now I’m looking for a new bean (not decaf) but there are so many options that it’s difficult to choose. Since I see Dutch roasted beans in this sub quite often, I felt it should be doable to get some recommendations here :)

Simply put I’m looking for a nice floral bean which is a bit forgiving to brew. I’m told a washed Ethiopian or Kenyan bean should be great. But even then, there are tons of options :)

Thanks in advance!

1pcihzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pcihzm/venting_today_is_our_anniversary/,Venting- Today is our anniversary,"After 10 years, I’m probably at one of my lowest. He’s so upset about anything on a very regular basis. Forgive me if I style this like a journal or diary.

1- went to Atlanta for the holiday week to see his side of the family. He was angry at any little thing. At one point his mother yelled at him bc he decided to leave our trip early and was rushing me to finish getting the clothes out of the dryer (which I was already doing but not fast enough). His sister, aunt, grandmother, and mother came to my defense about how he shouldn’t be treating me in such a way. He even yelled at me “Are you have you got everyone on your side?” And proceeds to leave the house w his grandfather chasing after to try and talk sense into him. As dos the women-Over the years, they haven’t liked me much but a lot of it is bc the things he’d say I would do (he’d blame me for his annoyances or how treat my stepson, same age as my bio son. I love them both, they’re both my boys, had my step since they were 5 but he says I treat them differently (always done my best not to. They’ve never even shared clothes, I buy for one, I buy for the other, etc), so them defending me was surprising. “We are women first”, they said.

2- before we left TO the holiday trip, we had a disagreement. We were going to buy pizza (solely for him, I wasn’t hungry). I chose to pay, drive there. Just asked him to accompany me. On our way back, I commented that once there was a little boy walking in the rain on the street we were driving on. I took him to his house, concerned. Chatting w the kid, he seemed healthy, well, and talked about home a little, no danger signs or other red flags. Ends up being the kid’s mom worked nights, fell asleep and didn’t pick up the kid. She thanked me profusely, invited me in, started making a simple lunch for the son who showered right away and he came back to eat his sandwich. I’d only stayed to see that things were ok and hopes this was simply an honest (but scary!) screw up on the moms fault and not willfull neglect. My husb stops the story and asks why I didn’t take him to the police, questioning me. Then he gets upset at how I “passed judgement” on a woman who left her child in the summer in a locked car, and went inside to smoke weed while her husband played video games. By the time they checked. The baby passed away. Was I wrong? Maybe? I don’t know, I went off my own judgement. But he became so angry that I didn’t agree. We get home w the pizza and he asks how many slices I’m going to have. “I don’t know”- I was busy packing, cleaning house. He asks again and I just tell him to leave them in the box, I’m not going to eat now. He says I’m being sarcastic. i could tell he was still mad from the stupid argument about the kid. Blow up argument, results in saying I’m in his way. I shut down, stopped packing, go to sleep).

3. Returned from 18 hour drive, we split the driving. He goes to work at 6a (we returned at 5:15a). I do also. Not much talking. Maybe a day to cool off. 🤷🏽‍♀️

4. Today is our anniversary. We had a cruise planned to leave this Saturday and paid for w my CC which he has been paying on. We do something each year. But bc of his oversight, we aren’t going bc he has nursing school finals during what would be our trip. Then after petty arguments he’s repeated “I never wanted to go on the trip w YOU anyway”. 😔 I have a gift for him. It’s sitting outside as we speak. Maybe I’ll just go get my money back. I don’t know. After I dropped off a friend at the airport this morning, I texted him to see if he had anything planned in case I should just go home vs store. He said “Don’t care. Do whatever you want”. I immediately called him, asked if he was ok. I expressed since it’s our anniversary, even though we weren’t seeing eye to eye lately, that maybe it meant enough that he’d just want to share a coffee at least. NO! He even told me to stop crying because he didn’t care about my tears and that I was trying to manipulate him and divert the conversation with crying. I told him that was evil to think- just mean. I’m crying bc I’m just so sad 😞

I yell to the skies- what is wrong? Why is he so angry so often? I’m tired of blaming myself for things that are clearly his own doing bc of his attitude. Im the peacekeeper. I apologize even when things aren’t even my fault. I’m embarrassed at his behavior. We go to spiritual services, he participates and does well. But then these anger bombs. Why am I still here when anyone else would’ve left? What else is there and why do I love him so much? I hate to see him like this.

Long winded, venting. I’m so sorry 😞

I’m not even sure what I’m looking for at this point. Sympathy? A kind word? Maybe some of yall had been through this? I’m sad. I’m upset. All understatements. I can’t stop crying. So much anger at the tiniest things… and I’m the punching bag. Why am I here? Am I just too prideful to accept defeat and leave? I’ve run out of answers. I’m giving up. My boys are 17 and don’t need much of me anymore. I’m just so done w feeling this way.",2,1764705018.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

I have brought this up before, and it felt brushed off like the girls were excited, they wanted to open and see what they got.

I could never imagine either one of my parents allowing this growing up. It feels extremely disrespectful.

So Monday, I was up before her. The girls were up and excited for the Elf and advent calendars, I asked them to get ready (dressed for the day) and we would wait for their mom to get up. I went out for a smoke and went back inside about 15 minutes later. Coffee was brewing, everything was opened, and I just felt and still feel defeated and unimportant.

So first if all Justin and Hailey obviously took jack with them but for obvious reasons they don't do walks with them when there's a chance they'll get papped . They go out for like 5 hrs max twice or maybe once a week and ppl start getting wierd .
It also amazes me how Rihanna and rocky can have nights out almost everyday and everyone's normal , Robert and suki , millie has a press tour, cardi is prepping for a tour and she literally just gave birth and no one bats an eye but the second the Biebers go out for a coffee suddenly nannies are raising jack . It's annoying . 
All in all I just wish they'd leave jack out of this snark or whatever bs they've got going on but what can you expect from a fanbase that called Hailey barren for years , wished miscarriage on her when she announced her pregnancy and constantly wish d€@th on jack constantly. It's worse when you know majority of these are middle aged women older than both Justin and Hailey projecting their Miserableness on two strangers they've never met. They need help.

Buckle up, because we're about to drop a bombshell of contrition that's equal parts therapy session and stand-up routine. We at Cappy Camera? Yeah, *us*. The cheeky underdogs who dared to build a camera that doesn't suck the soul out of your adventures. We're here to grovel: We've been too damn *fun*. Too *good*. And worst of all, too *addictively human* in a feed full of filtered facades. For dragging you into the wild, unedited now – no previews, no do-overs – we are *profoundly* sorry. (Wink.)

Swipe through our slides if you dare. First up: That bold blue banner screaming **""WE APOLOGIZE PROFOUNDLY""** over our striped wonder in white, orange, pink, and green glory. We're owning it – for forcing you to *live* the moment instead of live-viewing it to death. In 2025, when every gadget begs for your attention like a needy ex, our screenless stunner flips the script. Point. Click. *Trust*. No LCD crutch to second-guess your genius. It's like therapy for your trigger finger: Eco-crafted from recycled composites (light as a daydream, tough as your travel regrets), it slips into your pocket and pulls you out of it. 18MP stills that pop with lo-fi charm – hazy edges, vibrant pops, film-kissed without the fixer-upper fuss. HD video? Yup. Built-in storage for a zillion memories? Affirmative. USB dump to your phone for instant edits in VSCO? Chef's kiss. And those swappable lenses? Wide for epic streets, macro for the mundane magic. Sorry for arming amateurs with pro-level whimsy.

Then there's our **Public Statement of Regret** – that creamy beige box with the gold star, like a participation trophy for bad decisions. Negative side effects of Cappy? Oh, where to begin. Uncontrollable grins from surprise reveals. A sudden allergy to overthought compositions. And – gasp – actual *presence* in a pixelated paradise. Born from Taiwanese ingenuity (we rose from rebrand ashes, supply chains be damned), this isn't your grandma's point-and-shoot. It's the rebel yell against bloated tech: No apps. No subscriptions. Just rechargeable joy that lasts a full day of chaos. For eco-warriors, it's a guilt-free flex – biodegradable body means zero e-waste eulogies. Toy camera diehards? Those vignettes and color shifts will have you ditching darkrooms for daydreams. Download, tweak, share: #CappyCamera shots flooding your grid with authentic grit.

Slide three? Pure poetry in motion. **""WE REGRET THE NOSTALGIA""** overlays a sun-dappled subway scene – that woman's beaming hold on our candy-striped Cappy, metro map mosaic in the back, lives blurring by like a soft-focus dream. Our screenless sorcery strikes again: No preview means no perfectionism paralysis. You *shoot* from the gut, and bam – unexpected bliss. That ""terrible feeling of happiness""? It's the rush of rediscovering why you fell for photography: The serendipity. The sweat of not knowing. Frames that feel like stolen Polaroids from a parallel '90s, but with digital do-overs if you crave 'em. Travel hackers, street stylists, pet portrait pros – we've hacked your heart, and for the joy epidemic, we bow low.

And the finale? **""FINALLY, WE ARE SORRY""** in electric blue, stacked against a gritty stone backdrop: Three Cappys in yellow-red zip, green-black edge, and crisp white-black minimalism. For turning point-and-shoot film aesthetics into a playground. For hundreds of case designs that make your camera a mood ring – swap for stripes, solids, or surreal prints. We've made vintage vibes *this* effortless, fueling TikTok tears and Insta envy. Sorry for the shareability spike; your algorithm's thanking us, even if you're blaming us.

Look, in a year where AI ""art"" outpaces your coffee run and cams cost more than rent, Cappy Camera is the antidote: Affordable rebellion. Sustainable spark. Screen-free salvation. We're not gatekeeping the good stuff – we're flinging the door wide for broke creatives, burnout battlers, and anyone tired of tech tantrums. Grab one, hit the haze-lit streets, and shoot like the world's your undeveloped roll.

Twist: This apology? Total satire. We're *thrilled* you're hooked. Because life's too glitchy for grayscale. Dive into **Cappy Camera reviews** for the raw hype, custom cases on our site, or r/photography threads where we're the plot twist. Best toy camera 2025? Eco screenless shooter? Lo-fi digital dream? Search it – we're the glow-up you didn't know you needed.

Your most unapologetic Cappy tale? Hit comments. Let's laugh-cry together.

You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

1pci6vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1pci6vm/how_to_remove_my_ex_from_my_apartment/,How to remove my ex from my apartment,"Location: Ohio

TL;DR: My ex established residency at my house and refused to leave after a breakup. I’ve managed to get a temporary CPO but I’ve already been told I don’t have a strong enough case for a permanent. How do I prevent her from continuing to claim residency & being allowed to come back to my apartment?

My ex moved in to my 2 bedroom apartment w me in September of this year. When she moved in I made the landlord aware and he increased my rent by $70. My ex girlfriend is not on my lease, she has not paid any bills, she has received mail here & some of her belongings are still here. 

The long story short is that she has a history of escalating arguments but nothing has resulted in violence (yet). I have text messages & handwritten documentation of moments that show a pattern of behavior that could become violent, but hasn’t yet (i.e. hitting things around her, hitting herself, physically advancing, & blocking doorways). On top of that she has not worked or contributed towards the house since moving in despite that being a big part of our initial agreement. I understand this doesn’t hold any legal weight because I invited her in; but just giving an idea of character here. 

On 11/16 we broke up & I offered to let her stay for a month to get her things together & find a place. She refused this saying she needed more time. She also began demanding things in the apartment (i.e. split time in the bedroom, her own room, etc). 

On 11/17 I reiterated that I was firm on a month & that I would not be sharing my room with her. That if she wanted to stay she could take her mattress, but she was not allowed to take the second bedroom because this is my office. She had a full on meltdown, same behavior as before- screaming, hitting things, refusing.

On 11/18 I told her I did not want her administering medication or participating in the care of my animals whatsoever. She had also started making me coffee after we broke up, I told her I would prefer to make my own. Again, same behavior except this time she picked up my foster dog and gave her medication without my consent. My foster dog had an appointment that morning which I had told her I would transport her to. When I didn’t react to her instigations she picked up my foster dog & tried to leave with her. I was able to get between them and the door and get my dog back without touching her. She responded by throwing my coffee mug and telling me she would report me as threatening her. 

I told her she needed to find somewhere else to go. On my lunch that day I found that she had packed some of her things into my office. Within her pile of belongings were a lot of my things. Nothing of high value, but sentimental things that she was absolutely aware were not hers. I asked her not to take my things and she said she would report me for going through her things.

I texted her that afternoon saying she needed to pack her things and be out by 7. I understand legally this doesn’t stand but I’d hoped it would be the nudge to go. I promised her she could come back & get her things or leave her animals temporarily if need be.

When I came home she had moved the mattress & most of her belongings into my office. She was locking the door & telling me I was no longer allowed to access this room which contains a lot of my personal property (i.e. my laptop, computers, art supplies, art, etc). She refused to leave & said she would be staying for 30 days.

I contacted police but because she had established residency there was nothing that could be done. They offered an alternative for us to agree for her to leave on 11/24 but she refused. No report was made.

On 11/19 I took off work and filed for a CPO with the court of domestic relations in my county. I was granted a temporary CPO. The magistrate warned me that I do not have a strong enough case for a permanent CPO; however, he believed my story & my fear enough that he believed it would be best for her to be out of the house. The CPO was served at the apartment that night & she was made to leave. I also served her with a 30-day notice to vacate that night. She left her animals in my care.

On 11/25 she returned with police to pick up more things & made it very clear she intends to instigate further.
- telling me “don’t touch my things I’ll be back after your cpo gets dismissed”
- I had packed everything of hers from the bathroom & I said, “please don’t go in there, nothing of yours is there.” & she immediately walked into the bathroom.
- I asked her to keep the door open to the office while she packed because my belongings were inside and I wanted to ensure nothing of mine was taken, she closed the door.
- I asked her not to empty her cats’ litter boxes into a bag in my living room & to take it outside instead, she ignored me & didn’t comply until the cop finally asked her to take it outside.

I haven’t heard from her or seen her since (she’s blocked on my end). In the meantime, I’ve changed the locks & installed cameras. Our next hearing is on Friday, 12/5.

I’m over income for legal aid. I had a consultation w a lawyer who reiterated what the judge said in regard to a permanent CPO. Since she hasn’t hurt me & I don’t have physical proof, I don’t have a case. I’m awaiting another consultation to hear from a lawyer with more knowledge of the eviction laws/ residency.

I have accepted I probably won’t get the permanent CPO. I’m still going to fight for it but my question is, how do I stop her from claiming she is still a resident & coming back to my home?

I truly believe that if she were to come back she would instigate with animosity at any opportunity. I don’t want to get too deep into the she said/she said but her method of “coping” with me before the CPO was served was to glare at me any time I was in a shared space. She’s unpredictable, unwell, and I fear that if she was allowed access to me & my home again she would harm me, my animals, or my property or at the very least make my life as hellish as possible. Is there anything more I can do to protect myself? Are there certain things I should make sure I say on Friday?",1,1764704317.0,legaladvice,4,1.0,False

I also began to regain my sense of smell here and there. It was definitely noticeable. Things that had turned completely odorless many moons ago suddenly started to have a scent! I really enjoyed that change because there are certain scents like lavender or the smell of coffee that I really missed. However, toward the tail end of being on the supplement, my Parkinson’s symptoms seemed to get a little worse, and then I kind of slowed down my intake because I lost faith in the validity of my improvement. And then I ran out of it. But now having been off of it for about a month, I definitely feel worse without it! I noticed that the time I was on it I had a lot more energy and could just move more smoothly.

I need a new laptop and I use it for general stuff and mainly things like trading, programming, research, working, browsing, etc. 


Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:
 
No more than £1100 if possible

Are you open to refurbs/used?

Yes

How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?

It doesn't need to be a 2-in-1 just because I honestly feel like I would never use it in that way. I already have my phone and TV. Performance mainly because I don't want to feel like it could end up being slow or having problems doing stuff down the line, battery life would be nice because my lenovo at this point feels the battery really drains quick and have had it for a while. I don't know what build quality really means

How important is weight and thinness to you?

Important, I would not like something that feels clunky or like I am lugging it around. I like the feel of it being easy and non invasive to work with or take to a coffee shop for example

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.

13 - 14 inches. My lenovo I have had for the last 4 almost 5 years believe is like 15.5  inches and feel it is just time for a change to something that feels like physically consuming

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.

No although I am considering getting into programming and playing with AI so I would like to be able to do this

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?

N/A

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?

I assume I would definitely want it to be reliable build quality and good keyboard, I dont want it to break easy. Fingerprint reader I don't overly worry about if I don't have it. No idea what optical driver stuff like that is

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

I recently received offers for the MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering at both Waterloo and U of T.

I am trying to make a final decision and would love some insight from current students or alumni regarding which program provides better ROI and access to top-tier tech jobs given my situation.

Neither offer includes the Co-op stream. (For Waterloo, this means I likely won't have access to the full WaterlooWorks co-op board, just the regular student/alumni boards).

My Background & Goals:

* Current Role: I’m currently working at a tech company as an intern.
* Career Goal: I want to pursue work in Software Engineering, Integrations, or AI/ML implementation.
* Target: I am aiming for high-tech companies or high-growth tech firms.

My Dilemma: I know Waterloo has a massive reputation for engineering, but without the official Co-op stream, is the advantage lost? Conversely, U of T seems to have a stronger global brand and better location for networking in Toronto.

Specific Questions:

1. For Waterloo MEng grads: If I don't have the official Co-op designation, how hard is it to land internships? Is the ""Regular"" stream treated as ""second tier"" compared to the undergrads/co-op students?
2. For U of T MEng grads: How valuable is the flexibility of the program (e.g., taking ELITE/management courses mixed with AI)? Does the downtown location actually help with networking/coffee chats?
3. Reputation: For roles in AI or Integrations, does one school hold significantly more weight on a resume for US/Big Tech recruiters?

I was planning on quitting 1/1/2026, however about 3 weeks ago I had a panic attack when I wokeup. I went out the night before and took and adderall and was still vaping, when I wokeup I initially felt fine, then I went outside to grab my coffee and BOOM panic attack. I looked around and things felt not real? I instantly panicked and called 911, I thought I was dying. nothing looked real. 

  
for a few days after that I continue to feel like nothing around me was real. I slept most of the day and ended up not hitting my vape for 4 days cuz I was so out of it. then I hit it again for 2 days and then quit for good. it’s been 2 weeks since then and I haven’t vaped (17 days to be exact). 

  
I don’t even miss vaping, I’m so terrified of it. but I have such severe brain fog.. like there’s a weight over my eyes. I just feel out of it. I also soemthing feel like my body feels disconnected from me, I don’t know how to describe it besides it matching DPDR. however, this has gotten so much better!

basically would just like to know if my anxiety will get better? I’ve been so anxious that somethings permantely wrong with me or I’ll be stuck in the funk forever. I’m to anxious to even go out for a drink. i went out to dinner last week and finally felt fine at dinner but still a few moments of derealization. however Thanksgiving was bad.

He let me ramble for maybe 20 seconds and hit me with one question - 'ok,but what was their actual pain?'

And i, with full confidence and zero self-awareness - 'ROI'

Man looked at me like I’d just sent a lead a breakup text that opens with 'hope this finds you well' - 'bro, that’s not pain., just a small talk with numbers, u didn’t dig at all'

The deal died, ego bruised, lesson learned, butafter that, I stopped buying the first layer answers and started running the same 5 questions on every single discovery:

1/ What happens if this problem isn’t fixed in the next 3–6 months?

This is the moment where urgency either jumps out like a raccoon in a trash can or the entire call flatlines on the spot. I’m basically hunting for timelines, explosions, fire hazards, any sign this thing actually matters.

If their answer sounds like ‘we’ll survive’, cool, the deal’s already dead, they just haven’t sent the obituary yet.

But if they start talking about missed quarters, stalled teams, or some exec breathing down their neck? Congrats, you just found the ticking clock every good deal needs.

2/ Who else internally is frustrated by this?

Pain rarely travels solo. If one team is annoyed, odds are someone else is two meetings away from starting a riot.

The dream answer is anything like ‘oh yeah, engineering hates this’ or ‘finance keeps yelling’ , you’ve got a multi-threaded justification, not a lonely complaint.

Follow up with smth like- ‘If this stays broken, how does it hit their targets?’

People suddenly turn into poets when describing how other departments suffer, just use that.

3/ What are you doing today to manage this?

If they hit me with ‘manual process’, ‘we use spreadsheets’ or the cursed phrase ‘we manage it through an email chain’, we just hit the jackpot, hours disappearing like socks in a dryer!

Now all that’s left is to put numbers on it for them.

4/ What’s the cost of keeping things the way they are?

Then I start quantifying it: ‘How many hours/people/weeks?’ n boom suddenly their pain speaks in numbers, the only language that ever gets budget approved.

People treat numbers like radioactive waste, so don’t give them the chance to dodge it. I make them count it all: wasted hours, revenue slipping through their fingers, missed deadlines, annoyed teams.

Once they put a number on the chaos, it stops being a soft ‘nice-to-have’ and turns into real urgency, like ‘Wait we lose HOW much time?’

5/ What kind of pressure does this put on you and your team?

Emotional pain is criminally underrated and decision makers usually feel it the hardest. This is where they drop the real stuff - the stress, the late nights, 'my boss keeps asking about this', 'my team is exhausted' n etc. 

Follow with: 'What actually changes for you once this is off your plate?' That’s where they paint the before/after picture, clarity, control, fewer fire drills, maybe even touching grass for once.

Switching to this flow cleaned up my pipeline fast. Deals moved quicker, qualification got sharper, and I stopped babysitting ‘maybe’ deals that were never gonna close anyway

No urgency - > uncover it or walk

Then a text window faded onto the screen. Not popped up — faded, like it wanted to appear slowly, theatrically.
“Like reading?""
I looked around. No one suspicious. Just students, an elderly man reading newspapers, a bored librarian.
Then another line appeared:
“I like how you keep looking for me.”
My throat tightened. I closed the laptop and walked straight out.
I don’t know why I checked, but before leaving, I glanced at the CCTV camera above the door.
It was pointing directly at me.

Day 17

I didn’t go back to my friend’s place. Instead, I booked a cheap room in an old hostel near the train station. The kind where the sheets smell faintly of bleach and the doors don’t fully shut unless you slam them.
Around midnight, I heard movement in the hallway. Normal, I thought — drunk travelers, night-shift workers, whatever.
Then the receptionist knocked on my door.
“Sorry to bother you,” he said, “but… were you here earlier today? Around noon?”
I shook my head.
He frowned, hesitated, then said, “Someone came in asking for you. He showed a photo of you. Said you left your bag.”
A cold wave ran down my spine.
“What did he look like?” I asked.
The receptionist shrugged. “I don’t know. Hoodie, mask, sunglasses. Couldn’t see his face.”
“And you let him in?”
He looked offended.
“He had your picture.”

Day 18 

The laptop was on the small hostel desk when I returned. Closed. Untouched. I hadn’t used it since the library.
So why was the charging light on?
I opened it carefully, half-expecting another message, but instead there was a single audio file on the desktop:
“LISTEN.wav.”
For once, curiosity lost. I didn’t open it.
I grabbed the laptop, ran downstairs, and asked the receptionist—same guy—if anyone had entered my room.
He checked the log.
“No one’s been on your floor. I’ve been here all night.”
I asked about the CCTV footage.
He sighed. “The cameras on the third floor haven’t worked in weeks. Management won’t fix them.”
Of course.

Day 19 

I don’t know why I did it. Maybe I hoped it would give me a clue. Maybe I hoped it would just be static.
I played the audio file.
It was only ten seconds long.
At first, nothing but a faint hum.
Then breathing.
Slow. Close to the microphone.
And then a whisper:
“You don’t recognize me yet.”
My entire body went cold.
The voice wasn’t distorted. It wasn’t robotic. It wasn’t glitchy.
It was human.
Familiar.
I spent hours replaying it, trying to place the voice. A teacher? A coworker? A neighbor? Someone from my childhood?
But it didn’t trigger anything.
Nothing except dread.

Day 20 

Last night, I noticed something that made everything worse.
The audio file had a timestamp.
It wasn’t created when it appeared on the laptop.
It was created two years ago.
Before the fake PDF.
Before the pictures.
Before any of this started.
Meaning whoever is doing this didn’t just start stalking me recently.
They’ve had recordings of themselves whispering to me long before they revealed they existed.

Now

I haven’t gone back to the hostel. I’m typing this from a café with big windows and dozens of witnesses. I’m shaking so hard my coffee keeps spilling.
I know I should go to the police. I know.
But what do I bring them?
Screenshots?
A creepy audio file?
A laptop that acts possessed but shows no malware?
They’ll tell me it’s a prank. Or paranoia. Or stress.
The café just started closing. The barista asked if I’m leaving soon.
As I packed the laptop, a notification appeared on the screen — not a popup, not a message box. Just text, rendered directly onto the desktop background like it had always been there:
“Don’t go home.”
I don’t know if it’s a warning.
Or a threat.
But there’s one more line at the bottom, freshly appearing as I write this:

The idea came after I saw a photo of a tiny courtyard transformed by a single tall artificial tree that added depth and softened the light. I started looking for suppliers and found several models on Alibaba with metal cores and UV resistant leaves. I ordered a sample section to test in our space and was pleasantly surprised by the tactile quality of the foliage.

Close up the leaves read as convincing and the trunk textures looked natural enough under warm cafe lighting. Installation was more involved than I expected. Anchoring a tall piece required a discreet base plate and some weight to stop any wobble when the door opened. Dust is the main ongoing maintenance issue so we set a monthly brushing routine and spot clean with a damp cloth.

Lighting transformed the installation more than I imagined. Placing soft uplights at the base made the foliage glow and hid a few seams where branches met. Customers noticed immediately and commented that the space felt calmer. If you shop for artificial big trees on Alibaba ask for construction photos, confirm shipping packaging for large parts, and request details about UV resistance ratings. A little planning on anchoring and lighting turns a big artificial tree from a prop into a defining feature that holds up to daily use and looks inviting for guests.

I never thought I'd talk about something like this, but I saw a guy have a breakdown once, and it really stayed with me. His name was Gómez. People who didn't really know him thought he was some kind of robot – a trader who always won, like it was nothing. But I knew him before he had all the money, the cars, and the fancy apartment. He started with absolutely nothing. A crummy laptop that kept overheating. Nasty coffee. No sleep. But somehow, he was great with numbers, like an artist is with paint. A few years later, he was making more money than anyone I knew:

*   He bought a car, cash.
*   Got himself an apartment.
*   Filled it with monitors and strange green candles.

People started calling him The Machine. But I don't think he was in it for the money. He wanted to get away from his old life – the tiny apartment, always worrying, people who didn't think he could do it. And that's why when he messed up, it was so bad. The same things that made him good were what ruined him. His ego got too big. Life became too easy. He started thinking he was invincible. One night, trading started out fine. Then the market crashed. And it kept going down. I watched him – the guy who thought he couldn't be touched – lose everything in a single night. Two. Million. Gone. I still remember his face. He wasn't angry. He wasn't scared. Just shocked – like reality finally hit him. I'm not really sure why I'm telling you this. Maybe 'cause everyone always talks about winning. But how someone messes up… that's where the real story is.

The Knicks offense isn’t nearly as all-encompassing on the road as they are at home. In addition, the last meeting between these two in NY struggled to crack 200 points, the Knicks have cashed the Under in their last 4 straight outings (all 4 saw less than 231…), and Boston has cashed it in 7 of their last 10. I know both of these squads sit in the top 5 offensively speaking (and this might be a bit of a sweat…), but my money’s on the Under to hit.

1pchmhb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pchmhb,Vector Valley: A coffee bean brand from a timeline when Partition never happened (feat. Espressona),"This is a package for a fictional coffee bean brand, in a world where the [Partition of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India) didn't happen and the country gained independence as the United States of India (USI). The person who suggested the idea to make India a federation (and also my [Author Avatar](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar)), Dr. Irfan Kamal, became widely revered as ""Architect of the Nation"", especially as the country's economic situation improved astoundingly over the decades, to the point of becoming a superpower competing with the likes of the USA, the Soviet Union, and China.

In our timeline, Espressona Signora (you may remember her from [one of my previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtIsForEveryone/comments/1p6aj2j/drew_espressona_signora_in_a_couple_hours/)) originated this year, and was seen as just a part of the fleeting ""Italian brainrot"" internet trend. But in _this_ timeline, Espressona started as a series of sketches Dr. Kamal made in his sketchbook in his spare time and sometimes, during idle Parliament meetings. He admired the American cartoonists behind Looney Tunes, Tex Avery shorts, Tom and Jerry, etc., and he sought to emulate their creativity in this character.  
Dr. Kamal didn't just see cartoons as idle fun, though, but realised their immense visual and communicative potential. In some ways, Espressona also reflected his modernist and gender-equal aspirations for the nation: she was a secular woman with a sharp mind refined by engineering skill.

In his last will, Dr. Kamal declared Espressona public domain, a gift to artists in the nation and beyond. So, once his sketchbooks were discovered after he disappeared from public life, it became nationwide news. A stunning revelation: one of modern India's founding fathers was also a cartoonist. He had shared his Espressona drawings with friends before, but this was the first time they were known to a wide audience.

Due to the public domain status, then, Espressona was quickly adopted by artists. She appeared firstly in newspaper comics and advertisements. One of the companies that first adopted her, and still uses her to this day, is Vector Valley, because it was Dr. Kamal's favourite coffee brand towards his final years.

Later, she received her own animated series, originally in clear Indian English both for the forward-looking citizens of India and for easy export abroad. It was later dubbed in regional languages such as Hindi-Urdu, Bengali and Tamil. Today, Espressona is seen as one of the pillars of Indian media, helping kick-start the industry and becoming famous all over the world -- especially due to India's status as a Non-Aligned country during the Cold War, she was seen in both New York and Moscow, in Tokyo and Beijing.

1pchl5i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pchl5i,Blur India Perfume Honest Review + First Impressions,"I've been skipping ads from Indian perfume houses religiously, especially ones that don't specialize in perfumes but after 30 ads targeting me and reading one review on here about how someone did a blind buy of these Blur perfumes, I decided to get their combo of 3 scents at 999.

Now, I went into this with 0 expectations to begin with because this seems to be the only perfume line they have, which seems frivolous. After the money was deducted I was just stressed about what I'm going to get, but the deed was done. After using them for almost a month, here's my detailed review of the 3 scents.

1. The oils on all 3 perfumes are not synthetic smelling, which is great. It took me 2 weeks to come to that conclusion, which comes to the second most important point of my review-
2. These require HEAVYYY maceration. Day 1 of receiving them, they smelled v v different. I kept them for almost a month, leaving them in the fridge for hours, leaving them without the cap in my cupboard etc to fasten the process. These were made like, yesterday. Generally with bigger perfume brands, perfumes are manufactured and stored for months before they go to market, but now I've seen a lot of smaller brands shipping out fresh perfumes. The cons with this is a lot of people will immediately take a sniff and reject these, without letting the perfume breathe. They have mentioned it on the box that these scents require breathing time, which is a good step towards consuming education. 
3. These initially would last 4 hours ish on my skin. Now, almost over a month in, these last about 6ish hours on my skin and almost overnight on clothes. Specific fragrances do which I'll discuss (please bear with me 🤌🏻)

Now let's get into the specifics of each variant in order of my most to least liked.

1. Coffee cake doesn't smell anything like coffee on the top notes, it's more cardamom and ginger heavy, more like a cinnamon latte. While they have mentioned the exact notes in the website, I can see why people would expect a more coffee heavy fragrance (it's literally in the name?) The dry down does have very slight black coffee and vanilla. I don't think i will have the exact words to describe this scent, but it's very wintery Christmassy, VERY VERY gingerbread man-esque and I LOVED IT. Honestly, if I didn't blind buy, I would've never bought a perfume with cinnamon and ginger in it's top notes, but this turned out to be a repurchase worthy scent for me 🤞🏻

2. I read in the original review  ""Cookie Crumble sits much closer to Plum Vanilla Caramello and Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 62. warm, nutty, and slightly more floral and fresh but with very delectable and almost the same dry down😍"" and I agree (I honestly didn't want to write something new for this perfume lmao) It's kinda like caramelo with a better lasting power and a floral freshness to it. It was a good purchase for the price but I personally wouldn't repurchase, just felt...slightly generic. I'm not a fan of Plum Vanilla Caramello either, so that checks out. If you like the Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 62, you'll like this. The notes are 80% similar MINUS (strictly minus) the almond notes. 

3. Vanilla melts is the last scent I tried tbh...  it's a been there done that kinda vanilla scent. The dry down is good no doubt, but maybe I prefer scents with more intricate notes. It's an almost linear mix of woody vanilla and sandalwood, and supposedly like a lighter version of kayali vanilla 28 (i have not smelled it so idk). It's apparently the most popular one, but for me coffee cake was the clear winner with it's notes and dry down.

Overally I'd review: 
3.5/5 for the notes- Ol' reliable gourmands. That is what sells in the mass markets I guess, that's why all Indian Perfume Houses stick to the same DNA 🙏🏻

Scent Quality- 4/5 The oils definitely do not smell synthetic which is a plus at this price point of around Rs 333 each in this combo.

5/5 for the packaging. The bottle actually has little cakes and cookies printed on it, which I haven't seen any Indian brand do. I thought that was a super cute touch.

3.8/5 for performance in terms of projection and longevity. It's honestly a good buy if you're looking for casual everyday scent, and maybe you can do 3-4 pumps of these before you do 1-2 pumps of your expensive perfumes (Like I've been layering cookie crumble with Burberry Godess intense- 3 pumps cookie crumble and 2 pumps BGI- heaven)

Overall, if you're looking for an affordable daily use kinda perfume strictly in the under 400-500 category, these make the cut. If you're going in thinking these will perform like your 2-3k and above perfumes, don't buy these, you can put in 2-3k more for premium options if that's what you want.

Hope the review helps✌🏻I tried to make it as detailed as I possibly could 🥺🤌🏻 Byeeeee.",6,1764702995.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,1.0,False

I’ve never bought from Black & White, so I was hoping someone familiar with their roasts might have some advice on brewing them.

They’re both two weeks and 5 days rested as of today, and I’ve brewed them both with the following recipe, which is my typical starting place for new beans:

V60 w/ hario filters

K6 @ 90 clicks or ~765 microns

TWW LR profile

15g : 250g @ ~95°c

45g bloom for 45s

Single center pour @6-8g/s up to 250g

No agitation

TBT 2:30

In both cases, the results were unusually sour and funky. I reduced the grind size by 5 clicks and the resulting cups were still quite sour. I reduced the grind size 5 clicks further which began to tame the sourness, but both coffees still lacked much nuance and the Los Nogales developed a mild astringency as if it were slightly overextracted.

That points me toward uneven extraction which could very well be issue, but it’s not an issue I typically have with my technique.

In short, I need some advice on taming the acidity and funk of these roasts so I can draw out more of the delicate flavors I’m looking for.

I expect they’ll need different things given that they’re two very different roasts one of which is even a blend. It just happens to be, coincidentally, that they both behaved similarly when making adjustments from my starter recipe.

To start, I want to say that despite everything my parents have done, I do love them and wish that we could have a relationship but based off the fact that I have tried for YEARS to make it work, none of my parents are capable of admitting fault, respecting boundaries or adjusting their behavior. I also want to admit that I was not perfect either. When I lived with them periodically as a young adult, like 20s I would steal their weed and alcohol. I have since stopped drinking alcohol, made amends to them, and paid them back. I say this for honesty and transparency and I only recently cut them off. I'm 38 and have not since repeated my negative behavior with them. My birth mom has told me that when I was born, she ‘knew I was a little mother’. My mom and dad are both practicing alcoholics and drug addicts. Once they had my younger brother and sister, my mom still had this weird delusion that I was their mother, and at times I felt like she also considered me her mother in a sense. I do want to mention that she was s.a.d by her father and not believed/gaslight by her mother about the situation. I know she, along with my other parents, had a very rough childhood. However, that did not give them the right to take it out on me.

 I distinctly remember her being gone for days and would lock herself in her room all day. That would leave be at 5, 6 and 7 years old to care for my 18 month younger sister and my brother, who was actually a baby. So, I would change his diapers, get both of them dressed make them breakfast and get them off to the bus stop for school. I would also cover their ears and sing to them when my mom and dad, or other men, would literally fist fight. They would both get drunk, start a fight, my mom would tell him to hit her, then was a victim when he did. He would cheat on her and hit her unprovoked too. I felt responsible to protect my siblings. I also want to mention that I don't remember taking care of them when I was really young, my sister told me. My brain obviously blocked out the trauma. But I do remember caring for them and protecting them around 9 or 10. This would include taking them on walks when they would fight and such. I also called the police on my dad multiple times. 

My parents had divorced when I was 5 and me caring for their basic needs started happening after that, when we lived with her as a single mom. My dad remarried. My stepmother did ‘give me back my childhood’ by being the parent and letting me be a kid, which i will always be grateful for. She was toxic However. For example, she would say horrible things to my dad, emasculating vindictive things. He was always drunk, I'm talking whiskey in his coffee, then his Gatorade at his construction job. After she would say these horrible things, which were either triggered by his immense immaturity, his drinking or the fact that he cheated on her, he would then beat her up and/or sa her. I would call the cops, he would sometimes go to jail, but she would always take him back. She was also WILDLY strict. I'm all for kids doing chores and being respectful, but we would spend 2 hours cleaning incessantly every day, and, for example, if we accidentally left a sock on the floor she would thrn scream at us for an hour. She had the need to control everything in her life and because she couldn't control ger alcoholic violent cheating bastard of a husband, she chose to take out all her control issues on us. I have always been a bigger woman, so she would constantly berated be for my weight. She would also do things like insult my looks, my dreams, things I was good at disguised as ‘constructive criticism’. What wad really going on was i was obviously younger, but also much prettier than her despite my weight, and she was/is the type of person that acts on her jealousy by attempting to tear others woman down instead of building them up because she wants what they have. I want to mention here that there is nothing wrong with being a bit jealous, what is wrong is attempting to mess with the person's self esteem, confidence and even trying to keep them from being more successful. I cannot stand people like that. She would also treat me differently when in front of men. She respects men, and not women, they are just competition to her. 

Anyway, so you are probably starting to see my reasoning for cutting them off. I also want to mention that my father is my grandma's only son and therefore can do no wrong. My grandma has always enabled his behavior, which is probably based in the face that my grandpa was a psycho and would beat him for small things, and he cheated on my grandma for most of their marriage with multiple woman. (He was the head of the agricultural department at a junior college and would use his status to sleep with his young female students. At one point he even gave some woman $15,000 then lied and said someone stole it, he didn’t know who, and even got the police involved). My grandpa did teach me some things about work ethic and respect that are invaluable to my life now, and he did help the environment and was a respected man in his field. He was a much better grandpa then father or husband. But, at one time he used my mental illness as a way to try and cover up his affairs while also trying to get me to join the military as a way to make me go away because he ‘knew I knew’. I also found out that he did the same thing with his own elderly mother, blaming her schizophrenia on why she saw him with other women. But he was still a better role model than my parents. (I'm aware this sounds insane, but I really had some crazy toxic adults in my life lol). There is a whole lot more to unpack there, but in the interest of time, I'll move on. 
I kept my stepmother in my life until she in addition to criticize my weight, she started criticizing my younger daughters weight. I warned her twice to stop, but she didn’t, so I cut her off. I remember at one point sometime before that I was offered a professional singing job in a jazz orchestra and she said something along the lines of, how could you leave your husband on the weekends to take care of your girls and your girls should have their mother at home. It wasn’t obvious then, because I was used to and unaware of her tactics that she was just jealous and did not want me to have that kind of success. 

So, back to my dad. He has always done and said whatever he wanted and wasn't told no or been made accountable by his mother, so he continued his ridiculous behavior. She would bail him out of jail, pay for rehab,etc. My dad has continued to emotionally and physically abuse his grown children (he slapped my sister once for calling out some of his atrocious behavior) when hammered, which was most days, he would project his hate for himself on us, like screaming I'm not a piece of shit, you are. And are you loosing it? And such over and over, like how drunk people repeat things and don't hear you. He also Ad his third wife, made her keep it a secret, but we knew. His third wife had her problems, (anyone that would stay with a man like my father obviously would) but she was actually a very kind, good women, whom my father definitely did not deserve. They had been together 20 years when she got an incurable disease that would steadily cause her to become entombed in her body, then she would pass away. Very soon after this, when my father realized that she couldn't sleep with her anymore, he asked for an open relationship, she refused (that's not who she was) he decided to DIVORCE her. He tried to use the excuse that getting divorced would end up with her receiving better medical care, which i understand, but that is not why he divorced her. He through away 20 years of marriage to a beautiful wonderful woman that was actually going to die in 2 years, which he knew, because he didn't want to go without s. and because he didn't want to take care of her. Keep in mind, she worked full time, did all the cleaning and ‘kept him satisfied’ for TWENTY YEARS and he couldn't take a cold shower or downtown Lester brown for 2 years. Selfish motherfer. There are about a million other deplorable things this man has done but I dont have time to list them. Like he called my brothers wife a p. for not breastfeeding. My brother did ‘overcome him physically’, which was so enjoyable, especially since my dad used to beat my brother incessantly and it was the first time my brother was able to fight back. I still feel so satisfied when I think about it. Also, the last time I saw my dad (which was actually after I tried and almost succeeded at unaliving myself, I was in a coma for 10 days. And what's interesting is both my birth parents just had to see me, I would assume they blamed themselves a little) he wanted to pay for dinner and a movie for everyone but the timing didn't allow. Instead of adapting, he threw a toddler temper tantrum by saying if we can't go to the movies he wouldn't pay for anything (which i didn't care about) but he also refused to talk to any of us and just stubbornly sat there. My sister had come with him, whom I adore, and we just continued enjoying our visit. Let the big baby have his tantrum. My dad has known for several years now that I will not take any of his crap, the gaslighting, a. and outright selfishness, so he doesn't mess with me, however anytime I would stand up to him, call him out or whatever, he would ‘take it out’ on my siblings, not directly talking about me, just being a general drunk violent ahole to them. He would also try to ‘get to me’ through my grandma, then she would try and convince me to come back, like ‘your dad has such a hard time’ and ‘but he's your dad, and he loves you’ pretty much saying, he's your dad and he has a right to you, and you just have to accept him for who he is. I love my grandma very much, but she has problems too,like everybody else. For some reason, all ‘three’ of my parents have believed that they dont have to be accountable for their own actions, don't have to respect boundaries, and are entitled to me being around to make them feel better about themselves. I have been their emotional punching bag/hostage and they believe that all of this is ok simply because birthed me. This is not the case. So, once my sister told me she was done, cut of my dad, I sent him this message, then blocked him-

I want you to stop trying to contact you. I never want to see you or talk to you again. I'm sure you can imagine all the reasons why. And do NOT take this out on my siblings or try and use grandma to get to me- she does not need that. (Side note, my grandma has dementia). Now LEAVE ME ALONE. You do not deserve to be in my life, and I have no need for you. You're a monster.

He has left me alone since then. Now, for my birth mother and why we're done. In addition to the things you already know, she also left us with a developmentally disabled woman as a babysitter who would give me food and put me in front of the TV while she sa'd my sister in her room. There was another time when I was 10 or 11 and she attempted to ‘sell me’ to a 19 year old man ‘temporarily’ for drugs. He refused. Recently, my husband and I were dealing with a lying manipulating landlord and we had a few days to find somewhere to live with our two teenage girls. At that time I had put the past behind me and was trying to hold onto the last parent in my life. Things were OK for a few days, but my mom drinks all day everyday, and her view of reality is heavily skewed even without adding alcohol to the mix. She's one of those people that makes every single conversation about her, even if she has nothing to do with it. Like say, I would come to her sad about something, she would find a way to make what I said a personal attack against her. She would say something around the house was fine, but by 1 pm that same day it definitely wasn't fine, and then she would explain all the reasons why, which rarely made sense. Or if her concern was legitimate, I would apologize and attempt to correct the problem she had either with me, the kids or my husband (apparently every one of their actions she didn't like was MY responsibility and MY fault). I tried so hard all day everyday to be respectful of her and her needs/wants at all times because it was her house and I was grateful for her help. She would just do a dr jackal and Mr hyde everyday about countless things. She would assume something i did or said was always an attack pointed directly at her and I was ‘disrespectful’ if I expressed how I felt attacked. 

If I tried to set any boundaries at all either her, I was ‘disrespectful’. Like, if you're really drunk, please dont go into the girls room because it makes them uncomfortable. She would also touch them, not in inappropriate places, but just how she would when she was drunk made them uncomfortable. She would also do things like ‘poke by bumhole’ when I would turn over, which made me very uncomfortable. There were so many times that she would say things like, do you talk to your friends or your sponsor about me? What do you say? I would say I'm not going to talk about that, then I was ‘disrespectful’. 

She only wants people around her she can control and manipulate. She also slings backhanded compliments/insults to anyone that is getting more attention than her, either good or bad. And she thinks she's bring sneaky about it but it's BLARINGLY obvious. She also expects apologies all the time, but she's NEVER in the wrong and never apologizes, unless as a last ditch manipulation tactic. She thinks that because she's my mom ill never cut her off. She was wrong. She drank beer all day everyday starting at 8am but all she really wanted was vodka. I believe that she would start fights in order to ensure an excuse to go out and buy vodka to drink. She did things like roll around on the floor drunk in front of my children, scream horrible things to her husband (he's not exactly a barrel of kittens either) make every single conversation an argument. I can't even list them all. She's just exhausting. I do want to mention here that when I was 18 and her husband was 38 or 39 he got me drunk and convinced me to sleep with him. I was in the wrong too, but he was the one who pursued. She of course blamed the whole thing on me, and still does to this day. It has been her favorite go to to bring up when I call her out with damning evidence as a way to escape any accountability. 

She also abandoned us when I was 11, my sister and brother younger, with the excuse of being afraid my dad would unalive l her. According to her it was a sacrifice for us to have a better life and she has been a martyr about it ever since. I have asked for two apologies from her, only two. The first was because I asked her to apologize for abandoning us. She said it was my dad's fault and you ask him for an apology. The most recent apology i asked for resulted in me cutting her off. She had not been feeling good when we moved out, so I texted her the next day asking how she was feeling. No reply. Then, I asked her again a couple of days later, no reply. Then, we all got Covid and were sick, which she knew. About a week after that, she called me. Not to ask how her sick grandchildren were, but to tell me that she feels ‘disrespected and unloved’ by me because I didn't call or text to check on her. Which i did, actually. I even sent her screen shots of me asking her twice how she was feeling. Her next tactic was to say you never told us, apologized or paid for the hole in the wall we accidentally made. In fact, I did talk to her and her husband about it, apologizing,  offered to to fix it, and offered $100 to fix it. They said, pay it when you can. Then we all got covid. So she said, just apologize for the hole. (Which i already did) but I apologized again anyway. I then asked her to apologize for assuming I didn't care about her, hence the screenshot, but her reply was the nail in our relationship coffin. She said, you should ask your dad for your apology. I knew then that this woman was permanently mentally inept to maintain a rational adult relationship. 

This whole thing actually really sucks because even though my brain tells me I am not responsible for their emotional happiness, self worth etc, my nervous system tells me I am. These are life long emotional manipulative abusive tactics to tell me that I have to fit in the box they made for me. But I don't. All they did was be the physical body that my real father, God used to bring me here. I'm not religious, but spiritual. They say religious people look forward to heaven, but spiritual people have already experienced hell. I will always be sad about this and will always love my parents, but no good comes from having my parents in my life, and it never will. I can accept that and be so grateful every day that my children know what unconditional love truly is. And my husband shows me the same. I am a strong ass woman. I am also very excited right now because my husband and I write music and I have been offered a paying gig to sing our original songs. My future looks bright and I no longer listen to the inner voices they put in my head. Now, I listen to God's.

In this version I finally added customization for the Lucky Button (the one with the little clover on the player screen).  
If you’ve never touched it: when you tap it, NSR throws you into a completely random station somewhere on the planet. Perfect for when your brain says “surprise me” and your attention span says “make it quick”.

Now you can tell the Lucky Button ***where*** it’s allowed to drag you.  
From the app settings you can pick which countries it’s allowed to explore.  
So if you only want stations from Germany, the UK and the Netherlands, just tick those and the chaos will politely stay inside those borders.

**Small disclaimer before someone grabs the pitchforks:**  
The country list is still a bit limited while I test the feature and try not to set the app on fire.  
If you want a specific country added, drop it in the comments and I’ll put it on the list!

I also gave the station search screens a full UI refresh, based on the newer style from the Favorites / Favorite Stations screens.  
Translation: the app now looks a lot less like a high-school homework project and a bit more like something you wouldn’t be ashamed to show another adult.

That’s all from me for 8.11.  
Huge thanks to everyone who took a piece of their day to leave 5 stars on Google Play – seriously, that stuff keeps this tiny one-person project alive (and mildly sane).

I’m currently in two nanny jobs that are both ending soon, and I’m not sure what my best move is.

Family #1: This kid is an absolute dream, but parents work from home and the dad is honestly so obnoxious. I love the child but the work environment 😑can’t stand WFH, so I’m kind of relieved it’s ending for that reason. I do love the mom, and we also spend a lot of time out of the house. They’re having another baby mid-year and have asked me to come back as their nanny then. I miss the kid, but the dad is a huge drawback for me, and it wouldn’t start until summer with a new baby. The kid I currently watch will be in school.

Family #2: This one is super convenient, it’s in my neighborhood and I can walk everywhere. Library, park, coffee shops etc. But the child is deep in a destructive phase, and doesn’t really engage with activities. On top of that, the hours are dropping to very part time in January, and I really need more, so would have to stitch it together with another job like I do now. This job will also end two months before the one with family #1 would start (daycare) so I’d have a two month gap.

So here’s my dilemma:

Should I just start looking now for January for a new long-term family so I don’t have to stitch together multiple short-term gigs from January to May and then again from May to July? A stable, consistent job honestly sounds better than trying to make these partial situations work, but part of me feels bad leaving kids and families I’ve already bonded with. The devil you know, ya know?

The sediment didn’t bother me.

Then Iswitched to French press grind, but it’s nowhere near that punchy, bitter hit I enjoyed.

Now I’m wondering two things:
How much am I missing by not grinding fresh?
If I buy whole beans and grind right before brewing, will it bring back that intensity? Or will it just taste the same, only a bit fresher?

Is French press even the right method for the bitterness and mouthfeel I want?

I’m currently in two nanny jobs that are both ending soon, and I’m not sure what my best move is.

Family #1:
This kid is an absolute dream, but parents work from home and the dad is honestly so obnoxious. I love the child but the work environment 😑can’t stand WFH, so I’m kind of relieved it’s ending for that reason. I do love the mom, and we also spend a lot of time out of the house. They’re having another baby mid-year and have asked me to come back as their nanny then. I miss the kid, but the dad is a huge drawback for me, and it wouldn’t start until summer with a new baby. The kid I currently watch will be in school. 

Family #2:
This one is super convenient, it’s in my neighborhood and I can walk everywhere. Library, park, coffee shops etc. But the child is deep in a destructive phase, and doesn’t really engage with activities. On top of that, the hours are dropping to very part time in January, and I really need more, so would have to stitch it together with another job like I do now. This job will also end two months before the one with family #1 would start (daycare) so I’d have a two month gap. 

So here’s my dilemma:

Should I just start looking now for January for a new long-term family so I don’t have to stitch together multiple short-term gigs from January to May and then again from May to July? A stable, consistent job honestly sounds better than trying to make these partial situations work, but part of me feels bad leaving kids and families I’ve already bonded with. The devil you know, ya know?

Would love to hear what other nannies would do in this situation.",1,1764702014.0,NannyBreakRoom,0,1.0,False

I \[24M\] fell for her \[21F\] immediately and we have seen each for 2 months, little over once a week. Our plans kept getting inconvenienced by illnesses and family matters and whatnot but we grew closer slowly, despite the two of us (especially me) being inexperienced, and her feeling burnt out from her 2 previous relationships with guys who treated her badly. We started with coffee dates, had drinks, dinner, cooked at my place and held hands.

This entire time she had been preparing for a 4 month study abroad program which was a source of stress but also the first time she would truly be away from her family.

The first crucial point for me was to ask her to be my girlfriend at the 1.5 month mark before she was getting ready to leave. She told me I was the most gentlemanly person she had ever met, but she was not ready for a relationship, and that she felt we met at the wrong time. I met up with her to continue this conversation, and told her it seemed to me like we were acting like bf/gf and asked her if she wanted to continue this. She agreed, and said she wouldn't have held hands with me if she didn't, but we didn't proceed with a commitment. We went on a few more dates, some more exciting, and some just plain coffee dates.

After she left for her study abroad program for 4 months, I tried to keep in touch daily. I hoped she would be more eager to keep in touch and send me pictures of new places etc. but she was more focused on settling in.

The last crucial point was my plan to visit her for her Christmas break to take her to places and spend 2 weeks together as a romantic break to our time separated. I hoped we would get closer during this time and that time apart from her would feel shorter for me. I called her, to confirm my plan to see her (which she had agreed to) but I told her this was a big commitment for me, which I would love to do, but only for a girlfriend, and I expected her to commit to a relationship if she wanted to do this.

She told me it would be unfair to me to give me an immediate answer, that she still wasn't ready for a relationship, and was still feeling burnt out from her previous relationships. I asked her to let me know by next weekend and she never did... She didn't respond to my text, or answer my call the day of. I had sent her a letter I hoped she would receive before responding, she might or might not have... It has now been a month

I'm just wondering if I pushed her away from me definitively, or if the situation is salvageable with her spending the next 4 months alone, hopefully with good memories of the time we spent together. I can understand she is in an awkward spot, and probably knows ghosting me was hurtful to me which makes it harder for her to reach out. I am still hoping she does, otherwise I'll find a way to test the waters after she is back.",1,1764701949.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False

The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the ""assassination"" stuff that they added in the free ride mode in The Old Country. It doesn't make sense. No mafioso, in Italy, in the US or anywhere had to kill 10, 20 or 50 guys in 2 or 5 minutes. This has no place whatsoever in a mafia game.

In the same way, too many missions in all four games require you to kill 30 people every time. I understand that this is a game, that this has to appeal to a broader audience and all of that, but we should get one mission every now and then where it's a proper, real mob hit.

You get one target, and pretty much like the heists in the GTA V story mode, you've got various possibilities on how you want to approach it. Do you want to lure the guy in a bar? Pop him when he leaves his house for his morning coffee? Blow up his car? Do you do this on your own or do you recruit members of the crime family? Do you care if innocent people get caught up in the hit? This has happened thousands of time in the history of the mafia, it has led to its most famous moments, and yet we're stuck with missions where we have to kill NPCs to the point where we don't even care anymore.

I do work from home. With that being said a highschool friend 26M reached out to me recently to hang out.

We ended up not being able to get coffee because the place was closed, and we went back to his place to sit and talk. which we did for hours, i havent had sex in about a year, so I initiated it tbh. I used to be a very sexual person and not having anything for that long was screwing with me but now i think i actually like him. I dont know if i should feel guilty liking this guy the way I do while im still living with my ex, also he knows I still live with my ex and the reasoning behind it. 

  
I feel guilty i think mostly because my ex made it seem like anyone who likes me is an idiot, and has said as much , and i dont want to bring this new guy into something he doesnt want,

1pcgx6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirtiesIndia/comments/1pcgx6u/the_echo_in_the_30m_house_room/,The Echo in the 30M House Room. ​,"And honestly? I’m lonely. It's damn.
​Not the kind of lonely you see in movies - a single tear tracing a whiskey glass in a dimly lit bar. My loneliness is more domestic, more insidious. It’s the sound of one toothbrush being put back in the holder. It's the silent argument with the refrigerator over what to order for the fifth night in a row. It’s the way the sofa remains perfectly indented in the exact same spot I left it this morning, a monument to my solo-occupancy.

​The Wedding Invites and the WhatsApp Silence
​You know that feeling of being caught in the tide, but your boat is anchored? That’s 30.
​The WhatsApp group chats, the ones full of my college buddies, have become less about cricket scores and more about baby names and pre-school admissions. Every Friday evening, my phone lights up with a string of photos: “Introducing our little princess!” or “Sanjay and Priya’s anniversary dinner.” And I tap 'Like,' and type a smiling emoji, and then I put the phone down, and the light in my own room feels suddenly brighter and much, much colder.

​I look at the invitations piling up on my desk—thick, cardstock promises of beautiful, shared futures. And every time I attend a wedding, a well-meaning relative (Auntyji, you know who you are) pulls me aside and says, ""Beta, now it’s your turn. Look how happy they are.""
​They don’t see the silent drive home, the way I turn the radio volume down so I can just hear my own thoughts, which inevitably spiral into: What is wrong with me? Am I not enough?
​The Empty Space Next to the Pillow
​The hardest part is the small, everyday details.

​It’s making too much dal for dinner, instinctively. It’s reaching for my phone to tell someone a funny incident that happened at work, and then realizing the only person I was going to tell was myself.

​It’s the silent agreement I have with the sun on Sunday mornings. It streams through the window, warm and bright, and I lie there for a moment, my hand resting on the empty space of the pillow beside me. I don’t just miss a partner; I miss the potential of them. The imagined clink of two coffee mugs in the morning, the debate over which series to watch, the shared knowing glance across a room full of strangers.

​It’s a different kind of pressure for a man in India at 30—it’s not just about finding love, it's about fulfilling the unspoken promise of creating a ghar (home). It’s about feeling the deep, generational weight of being the last leaf on the branch.

​I’m successful. I have a good job, a decent flat, and a life that looks polished from the outside. But when I come home, and the door clicks shut, the silence is a physical thing, a deep, heavy blanket woven out of unshared laughter and unexpressed comfort.
​And sometimes, I just wish someone would look at me and see not the capable, stoic 30M, but the tired, quiet boy who just wants someone to say, “It’s okay, I’m here. Let’s face the 30s, together.”

​I'm learning to be okay with my own company, truly. But God, I am tired of being the only one talking. I’m waiting for the day that empty side of the bed finally tells a tale of its own.",3,1764701550.0,ThirtiesIndia,0,0.8,False

Cammer actually called 911 on them,"I'm not quite sure what to think about the entirety of this bizarre encounter between the cammer and whoever those people are in yellow vests (presumably security). I came across this video while chilling with my coffee this morning and my initial reaction is that the cammer was being a total ass in the beginning, which I still think. But then, these security personnel kept the cammer stopped for what seemed to be an inordinate amount of time. I don't know. He then proceeds to call 911 rather than the non-emergency number, which I think is the wrong thing to do.

Personally, I would've just stopped without making a fuss and let these guys do whatever they were doing. Calling police probably would've never crossed my mind unless they were stopping traffic on the main road for an extremely long time, like say, more than 15 minutes and even at that, the non-emergency number.

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in NRW, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic, and I'd say I'm kinda cute? (I'll send selfies early on so you can be the judge of that yourself!). I finished my bachelors of law last thursday and I currently work in public administration in an upper-level role.

**In my free time, I'm into**

* **Reading**
* **Artsy stuff** (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos)
* **Cooking** (I love showing care through food!)
* **Gaming** (would love to play some co-op together c: - big fan of co-op horror if that's your vibe!)
* **Binge-watching shows** (maybe watch the final season of Stranger Things together now that it´s out?)
* **Fitness** (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics)
* **Traveling**
* **Self-care** (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.

**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, and consistency. When we like each other, we act like it.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability & Dependability
* Availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity (and good, direct communication)
* A bit of silly, dry, gentle humor and teasing

I value those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.

**Little dreams about us**

I'd love to travel a lot with you and make many memories! I'm already planning to go to Lapland and Japan/Taipei next year - ideally with the right person. A few dream spots:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (🙏PLEASE look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together in a van (maybe one that we build together?) and the same through rural Japan

That said, I'm also a bit of a homebody. Day-to-day, I picture steady and cozy weeknights, with new experiences on weekends and holidays. And if we do end up working out, my favorite thing to do together, especially in winter, would always be cuddling up and watching shows in bed together.

**Thanks for reading <3**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. Life's been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that someone is missing (You!😗). Like the titel implies, I´d prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier, but anywhere in EU is alright too.

**So, get in those DMs already!**

A quick hello with your age and the country you're from is a perfect start. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions!

Seriously, if you’re interested even a little, just say hi. You don’t need the perfect opener.

1pcgsvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPAP/comments/1pcgsvz/first_week_results/,First week results,"Hi!  Recently joined the CPAP fold. Here are my observations after one week of use.

Background: I have had mild sleep Apnea (12-14 interruptions per hour after sleep study in Jan) for years (perhaps a decade) and did nothing about it until a complete, total, finito, ultimatum, full-flatline-finished energy crash at the end of October, and the Dr reminded me that I needed to do something about this. 

Setup: a gifted Resmed Airsense 10 for Her with the following starting settings:
- Humidity at 4
- Autoset enabled (regular, not the ""for her"" routine), with allowable pressure range from 4 to 20. 
- Exhalation pressure relief enabled
- P30i mask from Amazon

Night 1: I had some trouble with the new plastic/new silicon smell from the mask and tube.  Ugh. But I needed the cpap so I stuck it up. Had trouble adjusting the mask as well, finally got it going into my nostrils. Slept OK, woke up with a VERY sore nose, felt like I had been punched in the nose, had a sore on one nostril, dry nose and throat.  That said, my brain was clearer than normal. My coffee intake was less (6 cups instead of my usual 12).  My energy crash was delayed to around 4 instead of 2 pm. My body was still exhausted though.

Night 2: increased humidity to 6 and made sure my tube had a drip loop. Also flipped the nose piece and added copieous amounts of vaseline. Woke up OK, but the tube was gurgling which irrationally terrified me. Again more brain clarity in the morning. I realized I had a dream, which was the first time in a long time. Again reduced coffee intake and delayed energy crash. Nose still hurts, but less. Sore was recovering. 

Night 4:  vacuumed all the condensate from the tube and mask. Reduced humidity to 5. Woke up around 3 AM and took it off, went back to sleep. Didn't rest as well. Had a massive headache for the day. Lots of coffee and crashed pretty hard at the end of the day. 

Night 5: Flopped into bed without using cpap. Woke up around 4 AM gasping for air.  Noticed that the soft tissue at the back of ky throat felt swollen. Put the cpap on. Woke up around 6 feeling a little refreshed, took it off and was absolutely surprised to see the pressure was at 20. Lesson: USE THE CPAP!  Nose hurts less, tonsils swelling did not reduce till evening. Significant coffee intake to survive the day. Body has more energy, able to exercise more. 

Night 6: back to using it correctly. Nose hurts less. Put it on around 11 pm and got up around 6. Brain feels calmer, clearer, more things get done in the morning. Still not exercising well but have more COGNITIVE energy throughout the day. Again dreaming at night. 

Night 7: 11-6.  Considered not using, then remembered the punishment, and also something inside me WANTS this. I hare that I have to rely on a machine, but something in me very clearly likes - dare I say LOVES - it. I can't explain it any better than that. I slept on my side for a bit which was nice.

1pcgrxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pcgrxl/superstition/,Superstition,"

Isn’t it strange how almost every village has its own urban legends and superstitions?

 

Some are more frequent than others like don’t whistle at night or don’t leave bread on the table when you go to sleep.

 

Some places have more superstitions than others, others far less so.

 

The more remote villages provide plenty of such folklore.

 

Yet, some superstitions in my village are… odd, and something you won’t hear in other places all that often.

 

Every kid here grew up hearing the same rule: when the sun touches the ridge, you run home and you don’t look back. I used to think it was just old people being dramatic.

 

The door is immediately locked, the windows are covered, and the light is dimmed to create an eerie ambiance by itself.

 

It honestly doesn’t help that this place is so remote it barely has electricity. There is no street lighting, and the street is actually a barren dirt road passing through old ravines and dense forests from house to house.

 

If you plan on visiting someone and nightfall catches you, you are spending the night at said people’s house. No questions asked.

 

Oddly, everyone seems to abide by this custom. No one will let you walk outside at night, yet over generations the population dwindled and only a few dozen people now live in the village.

 

My parents left a long time ago, and I used to spend my summer and winter breaks in the village playing with farm animals and my friends. It was truly a great time; all that reminds me about my childhood is here.

 

Now my old grandparents’ house has fallen into disarray. It’s still functional but often in an unkempt state.

 

Still, I have a yearly tradition where I visit my old childhood friend Theodora, who decided to remain in the village despite the lack of work and opportunities.

 

She says she doesn’t see life get any calmer than it already is here.

 

I recently arrived at her house. She lives alone, and not many things have changed since we were children. The interior of the house resembles something out of the 1930s, with lower-than-usual ceilings and old wooden floors.

 

Theodora did somewhat modernize the place. All in all, it is a quaint retreat from the hectic life in a major city.

 

Immediately after arriving, Theodora welcomed me to her house and insisted I stay at her place.

 

Looking through the window of her house and seeing the pristine mountain range view from her window, I couldn’t say no.

 

We sat for hours, drinking coffee and later drinking a homemade cherry brandy she had prepared specially for this occasion.

 

For once in a long while, I felt calm.

 

The sun had started to set below the horizon, and Theodora immediately put her glass down and started closing the windows and locking the front door.

 

“This old tradition, come on Theodora, you remind me of a grandmother.” I laughed mockingly.

 

“Stela, some traditions… are there for a reason.” She looked both upset and worried by my demeanor.

 

If frantically locking everything and dimming the light to the point where we could barely see wasn’t enough, she also placed a large cross on the front door.

 

“What are you doing? You are giving me the creeps; you know?” I laughed.

 

“Stela… things here sometimes… have the habit of coming unannounced.” She seemed actually scared and nervous as she gazes into the sunset as if looking for something.

 

What was a calm and festive atmosphere a few moments ago suddenly turned awkward and somewhat unnerving.

 

Theodora started to lower her voice when talking, often barely whispering and nodding her head in response. She seemed in a hurry to go to bed, but it’s winter and the sun sets early; it’s not even remotely bedtime.

 

Deciding that she is the host, I stand up and decide to help her with the dishes.

 

Theodora gestures to leave it for the night.

 

I had enough of this for my first day so I reluctantly agree to go to bed.

 

“Damn, I forgot my medication in the car.” I got up and saw Theodora’s pale expression.

 

“Stela, you’ll be fine one night, it’s only iron supplements.” She put on a forced smile, almost begging me not to raise the issue of going outside.

 

“Alright, fine, we can argue in the morning.”



“Good, I left you some pajamas on the bed in your room. Remember to keep the blinds on all night.” She smiled.

 

Annoyed, I told her good night and went inside my room. I put on the oversized pajamas and tucked myself into bed. I could hear the old stove in the living room cracking gently.

 

My room, and any other room for that matter, is almost ice cold. As it goes here, only the living room is heated, as it is the only place with a wood stove. Everything else… good luck.

 

I turned and turned in my bed, unable to fall asleep. I had forgotten my sleeping medication in my car, and it was somewhat early to go to bed.

 

The room was pitch black due to everything being sealed like a bunker.

 

After rolling around for a solid three hours, I looked at my clock and it was midnight.

 

“For God’s sake.” I got out of bed and pulled the curtains.

 

The moonlight illuminated the mountains; it looked like a mountainous winter fairytale, albeit a remote and desolate one.

 

I cracked the window open slightly, calmly pulling it towards me so as not to make a single sound.

 

I spent the next ten or so minutes gazing into the mountain forests… until I saw something long and dark standing in the open field.

 

It’s the dead of night and distant, but it looks like… a very tall woman with long matted hair, and… her neck looks like it is bent at a 90-degree angle.

 

I blinked and it… was gone. Yet somehow the air outside felt, different for a moment.

 

Theodora stormed into the room, almost screaming at me. She slammed the window shut and pulled the blinds before dragging me into her room with her palm tightly pressed across my mouth.

 

“Did you see it?! Nod your head for yes or no!” Theodora looked at me with frenzied, bloodshot eyes.

 

I simply nodded yes.

 

“Hide…” she whispered in my ear.

 

Terrified, we crawled under her bed and cuddled up on the cold floor.

 

It was silent. Then we heard gentle knocking on the front door.

 

“*I’m home*…” The voice sounded broken and inhuman.

 

Theodora and I cowered our heads as the mere sound of this voice sent us into panic.

 

The thing started repeatedly turning the handle, then, realizing that the door is locked, proceeded to smash the door at an ungodly speed.

 

“*Let me in… Stela, I’m home… Let me in*!” the voice started getting more and more violent.

 

After a few minutes, the noise stopped.

 

My heart still didn’t calm down, and I felt like I was going to faint.

 

I slowly pull myself from under the bed and make it to the front door. Theodora is too afraid to speak or move.

 

I slowly look through the peephole; other than complete blackness, there is nothing there.

 

Hoping for a moment of respite, a crackling sound starts moving across the house. It sounds like someone is dragging his nails against the brick wall.

 

I peek around the corner only to notice a pair of dark eyes staring at me through the windows.

 

…It wasn’t darkness I saw through the peephole; it was its eyes.

 

I slam the door of my room shut and force a chair under the knob.

 

Suddenly I can hear it on the roof, hastily scurrying across the old tiles.

 

I flick the light switch on and hear Theodora scream from under the bed.

 

“Stela, NO!”

 

The light inside immediately dies down, and I notice that the living room window is open.

 

“*St… el… a*,” a dark voice carries around the house.

 

And then, the bathroom door at the end of the hallway slowly creaked open.

 

The ambiance inside makes no physical sense; the bathroom looks like it is illuminated by darkness, as if the darkness was not darkness but a black light.

 

I look at the old small bathtub, filled with black water.



Two hands slowly creep out of the bathtub, as if it were meters deep, and long sharp fingers hang over the bathtub’s edge.

 

Slowly two black eyes peer under the water, and then its long matted hair and an unnaturally long jaw. The creature was a greenish-blue decaying color.

 

It rose and rose, reaching an unnatural height before snapping and falling down on all four limbs.

 

“*Thank… you for… letting me in… Ste*la,” it said as its eyes started to glow red.

 

Theodora quickly shoved me into a small pantry, one the two of us can barely fit in, and closed the door.

 

The house shook violently; we started to hear a roar as the creature demolished the interior, trying to claw its way inside.

 

“Stela, there is a hammer on the shelf behind you.”

 

I barely manage to move my hand and give Theodora the old rusty hammer. She starts knocking out the wall, one brick at a time.

 

“*Let me in*.” To our horror, the thing had started to mimic our voices.

 

Theodora manages to knock out a few old bricks and make a hole barely big enough to squeeze through. She goes in first and pulls me out just moments before the door gives in.

 

We run as fast as we can barefoot and get in the car.

 

Thankfully, I had left the key in the ignition.

 

We notice the creature standing still in front of the house, grinning with its elongated mouth.



I slam on the gas and speed off away from the village.

 

We are barefoot and freezing, in our pajamas, and all our belongings are in that house. Both Theodora and I are shaking and terrified.

 

We will not attempt to go back there, not now or ever.

 

It seems some superstitions carry more truth than we ever wanted to believe.

 

I just hope I invited that thing into the house, rather than into my own life.

1pcgq08,https://www.reddit.com/r/zenpractice/comments/1pcgq08/leonard_cohens_morning_routine/,Leonard Cohen‘s morning routine.,"Many of you likely know that Leonard Cohen was the student - and probably one of the best friends - of the infamous Joshu Sasaki Roshi, who came to L.A. in the sixties and went on to establish the Rinzai Zen Monastery at Mount Baldy.

I recently stumbled upon this quote and thought it could be worth sharing, since we have kind of been brushing the subject of poetry here lately:

""I get up at four thirty. My alarm is set for four thirty. Sometimes I sleep through it. But when I am good to myself, I get up at four thirty, get dressed, go down to a zendo (meditation hall) not far from here. And while the others, I suppose, are moving toward enlightenment, I am working on a song while I am sitting there. At a certain moment I can bring what I have learned at the zendo, the capacity to concentrate, I can bring it to bear on the lines that are eluding me.

Then I come back to the house after two hours. It is about six thirty now, quarter to seven. I brew an enormous pot of coffee and sit down in a very deliberate way, at the kitchen table or at the computer, and begin, first of all, to put down the lines that have come to me so that I don’t forget them. And then play the song over and over again, try to find some form.

Those are wonderful hours. Before the phone starts ringing, before your civilian life returns to you with all its bewildering complexities. It is a simple time in the morning. A wonderful, invigorating time"".",8,1764701109.0,zenpractice,5,1.0,False
1pcgpiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pcgpiz/aita_for_how_this_relationship_ended/,AITA for how this relationship ended?,"Hi Reddit,

so this is a long story but i need some opinions. my boyfriend and I broke up in april 2025. We'd been together for almost 2 years and were extremely in love. We were from the same home state, went on trips together, met families, talked about our future. We live in a major city now and we met at the restuarant he works at that is downstairs from where i live. We talked about moving in together,  getting married, moving back to our home state eventually. it felt like I found my person. Not only all of that, but we had amazing communication, it felt like we could talk about anything and our relationship is unlike anything either of us had expereinced before. So March comes, and he tells me he is really depressed and cant seem to get out of it. he started getting really weird when we talked aabout moving in together which was coming up at some point in the near future. he ended up breaking up with me but didnt seem entirely sure about it and just wasnt himself at the end. I was devastated. 2 months later he came back saying that i was the one think in his life that was missing and he realized he wants this. I told him that he needed to start therapy before i consider this again. I also started therapy and it seemed like we were both on the right track. over the spring & summer we were talking regularly, would have conversations about our relationship, what we wanted, what went wrong, how we wanted to go about starting again. we had decided to wait until the fall to really have the conversation and in the meantime we would meet for coffee, catch up, and try to support each others independent healing. we also werent sleeping with other people at this point. So september comes and he is working a ton, it was a 1 1/2 month long work stint where he was basically working long hours every day with no weekends. he was still talking to me at this point and just was really exhausted which i totally understood. by october, we met for coffee and had the talk about ok is it time we start really talking about getting back together and we both seemed to agree it was about that time and were going to take the month to start building the relationship back up. it seemed like he was happy about this. And then he just turred off again, he was dry texting, not making plans, just keeping me at an arms length is how it felt. eventually i got pretty pissed about it all and stopped putting in as much effort too. We had plans to hang out one day and he just never texted me. i was really hurt and pretty much competely done. i texted him that night and asked if he forgot and he replied with yes im sorry i spent too much time at a bar today and spaced. and then asked if we could do today instead. i didnt reply for over a day and he called me and apologized. I asked him to come over the next day to talk. he came over and this is when we ended for good. he was saying that he was so exhausted from this work stint he had (which ended like that week) and didnt feel like himself and was too lazy to try and work on our relationship. he said he loves me more that hes ever loved anyone and he wishes we could just go back to when it was good but doesnt want to work on things to get them there. i told him i wasnt going to beg him to be with me and that he should probably leave. I also said that it shouldnt necessarilly feel like work to get back together and we would eventually get back to the relationship we had but its not just going to happen overnight and it takes time and effort from both of us. its just so weird because it honestly felt like he was forcing himself to push me away even though everything leading up to this conversation didnt seem like he was unsure about still wanting this.

ive been really depressed since this breakup and just emotionally drained. i really wanted this to work and it felt like i was giving my all but he (in his words) was just too lazy. it sucks. do you think its totally over with this person? should i just try to move on completely and forget about him? theres a lot more to this story, this is just a short version of everything that happened. but i could really use some advice. I still love him so much but i cant tell if its just my fear of moving on and having to start from scratch or if this is something worth holding onto?",0,1764701080.0,AITAH,2,0.33,False

Please excuse the length of the story, but some parts are crucial to the why I might be the a\*hole.

(please forgive my English, is my third language, so I will try my best to use the correct grammar).

This story begin three years ago when at work I (F30) met my now fiancé (M32, let's call him Zack). I always thought 'cute guy' but I never considered anything but a friendship between us, I was dating someone else when I started working in the company. We started as friends going for coffee when he was in my area because we have common passions, it was nice since I just moved to a different country and didn't have many friends.

I love cooking and baking so I would bring my experiments at work to share with the colleagues. Before the Christmas holidays we organize a celebratory breakfast and everyone bring something. I brought a cake, that it's quite difficult to make (take about 2 days). As usual I made too much so Zack took some leftover. His mum (let's call her Karen, because I think she is the perfect incarnations of the stereotype) came to see him during the lunch break and Zack introduced us, it wasn't a long exchange because I had plan to get my nails done during the lunch break so I had to run out. When I was back I asked Zack if he had a nice lunch and he decided to share with me his mom thoughts ON ME! She said that if I wasn't overweight (I was 187lb, I'm almost 6'2 so yes I had some extra weight but not obese) I would have been good-looking. Mind you, she is far from a VS model. The comment hurt but I didn't really care, I wasn't planning on spending any time with her.

Too bad that after a couple of months Zack and I started dating, all nice and dandy since she leaves too far to come visit. So she usually come during the holidays, so came the second Christmas and she comes again to have lunch with Zack. I, once again, have booked to get my nails done because I had a Christmas party that night and wanted to be perfect. So, I have a short small chat with her and wish them a nice lunch, I thought that it was the right thing to do considering they don't see as often as I see Zack (every day). And guess what, I came back from my relaxing 45 minuted of pampering and my boyfriend thinks it's a smart idea to share his mum opinion of me: I was rude for leaving but at least I lost weight from last time she saw me, and now she can understand why he likes me. I told him that's quite rich coming from her, but honestly I have been told worse. He excused her saying she just doesn't have filters. No Shit.

Anyway, from other people I come to know she doesn't think I'm enough for her beautiful son. Fair enough, mama's boys aren't for anyone and probably they would be single for life if it was up to their mothers.

Come an other holidays and it was a nice day and I went for a walk, I had the unfortunate idea to tell my boyfriend where I was. And he decided to join me with his mum, could I say no? yes, but I thought it would have just prove her right. That I'm rude. So off we go to a 3 hours walk. The lovely hike I imagined to do with my music blasted in my brain so I didn't have to think, it turned into a questioning of why I decided to take a lower position than my precedent one and why ""I'm not choosing a real job"" (funny how me and her son have the same job). To then move into discussing my father properties, they DO NOT belong to me, but she started asking how much we rented for and how we managed them. which house will go to me once my parents are gone. I'm in possession of all these info but I don't feel I need to share them with someone I don't know.

I'm considering braking up because I can't see myself putting up with Karen for the rest of her life. Zack expressed that he sees me like the mother of his children and that scared me. I always wanted to have a mother-daughter like relationships with my MIL and I know I could never have that with her. My best friends say to run, my family likes him. So I'm torn.

So now we come to why I might be the a\*hole. I have been invited to join them for Christmas, but I really don't want to. Zack's dad is a lovely man, nothing like the ex-wife, but still I don't feel like spending an entire day with Karen. I lied and said I already made plans with a friend's family (they always invite me for family festivities), but he keeps insisting he wants me with his family and that I spent the last 3 Christmas with my friend's family.

We’ve got a weight-loss challenge going, people are swapping salads, the whole nine yards. I, wanting to be a supportive coworker and arguably the ""office hero,"" decided to bake some treats that wouldn't ruin everyone's macros.

I found a recipe online for ""Fudgy Keto Brownies."" The key ingredient was a sugar substitute. I went to the store and found a big bag of generic sugar-free sweetener on sale. I distinctly remember thinking, “Wow, this is way cheaper than the name brand stuff! Score!”

The Fuck Up: I didn’t read the back of the bag. Specifically, the part about the sweetener being 100% Maltitol. For those who don't know (like I didn't), Maltitol is essentially a delicious, crystalline laxative if consumed in anything more than a microscopic dose.

I made a double batch. They tasted amazing. A little fudgy, super rich. I brought them in for our Quarterly Budget Review—a mandatory, three-hour meeting in our conference room which, crucial detail, has glass walls and is located right next to the single office restroom.

Everyone loved them. My boss, ""Dave,"" ate three. I ate two. The mood was high. We were looking at spreadsheets, feeling healthy, living our best lives.

About 45 minutes in, I felt a rumble. Not a hunger rumble. A ""something is deeply wrong in the engine room"" rumble. I ignored it, thinking it was just the coffee.

Then I saw Dave shift in his seat. He looked pale. He loosened his tie. A bead of sweat rolled down his temple.

Suddenly, the finance director, ""Sarah,"" stopped mid-sentence. Her eyes went wide. She quietly closed her laptop, stood up without a word, and speed-walked out of the room.

That broke the seal.

The gurgling was audible. It sounded like a whale trying to communicate in the distance. Dave looked at me with betrayal in his eyes and whispered, ""What was in those brownies?""

Before I could answer, my own stomach dropped into my shoes. I realized what was happening. It wasn't a meeting anymore; it was a hostage situation, and the captor was our own bowels.

The next two hours were absolute anarchy. Since there is only one bathroom, a queue formed. A desperate, sweating, silent queue of professional accountants clutching their stomachs. Those who couldn't wait had to run down the hall to the building's public lobby restrooms (a 3-minute sprint).

The meeting was adjourned early because Dave literally couldn't speak without grimacing. I spent the weekend turning myself inside out and receiving Slack messages that ranged from ""I think I'm dying"" to ""Why do you hate us?""

I am currently hiding in my cubicle. I have not made eye contact with Dave yet.

TL;DR: I made brownies with a massive amount of laxative sugar-substitute for a 3-hour meeting. The entire finance team spent the afternoon fighting for the toilet. I effectively poisoned my boss during a budget review.",212,1764700674.0,tifu,49,0.77,False
1pcgism,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1pcgism/85_healed_my_journey_my_personal_advice_for_lpr/,"85% healed! My journey, my personal advice for LPR","Hi everyone, I would like to start by saying I don’t think I had the most severe LPR ever, but I still think it would be insightful to share my opinions for anyone who needs it. LPR has been the reason of countless depressing sleepless nights and so much constant stress to juggle, I would love to help out any way I can. I’ll split the post into parts: my journey, my symptoms, what worked vs didn’t, and just overall advice.

Before I start, I’m 19, not overweight and don’t smoke. Also, I say 85% healed as I do get flare ups, but nowadays I can get rid of it in maximum 3 to 4 days. (Highkey my fault for the flareups tho I eat every single trigger food possible sometimes)

Come to think of it, my first encounter with LPR started two years ago (2023) when I had a bad flu. I assumed it’s just the worst flu I had because the postnasal drip was absolutely atrocious to deal with as warm water and sinus rinses, nothing did the trick. (and it didn’t help I had a gig the next day, just zombie through that). However, this only lasted one night whereas what led me to a spiral was about around 5 months ago (June) when I was left with really bad LPR after I just finished the flu/covid, not too sure.

It was around 3 days after the flu when I noticed a globus feeling, and throughout the 5 months I was met with all sorts of symptoms:

·         Globus (thick phlegm that cannot be washed)

·         Constant urge to choke (saliva pools at the back of my throat)

·         Constant urge to swallow

·         Sometimes it is difficult to swallow

·         Throat burning (even water burns)

·         Throat tightness

·         Fragile/Loss of voice

·         Hurts to talk

If anyone could go through this without absolutely losing their shit, I have full respect for you but on a real note all these symptoms coming one after another have really driven me to constant anxiety and honestly one of the saddest times in my life as social events, sleep and just overall wellbeing has been so poor. I scrolled for hours, this subreddit might be my most viewed thing ever on the internet and ive tried countless things.

**Didn’t work**

·         **PPI’s (pantoprazole, esomeprazole)**

I’ve tried to keep an open mind and ignore the ""doens't work"" allegations but it just didn’t work for me. 40, 80mg didn’t work only placebo, ive tried to keep an open mind and try but nah. From what I understand **(lower acid ≠ stopping the reflux).**

 

**It’s okay**

·         **Elevating pillow/incline pillow**

To be honest, i've did this on nights when I had bad flare ups and it kindaaaa worked? It was too small and too inconsistent of a difference for me to really conclude because LPR symptoms are so hard to conclude whether it’s better or not (touch on this later).

·         **Honey**

I like it, its soothing thats about it, doesnt really stop the feeling but it feels warm and nice.

·         **Chewing well**

This genuinely is good but it’s just slow hence why its here, just a good habit to adopt as it improves appetite and digestion (for me)

**Worked**

·         **Alkaline/Baking Soda water spray**

This and probiotics were what changed things for me, the alkaline water deactivate pepsins in your throat and whenever anything acidic enters your throat it won’t cause damage as there isnt any pepsin there to be activated. But do know this doesn’t stop the reflux itself, only help with your throat.

·         **Probiotics with Digestive enzymes**

DISCLAIMER, I was never an alternative medicine guy, I almost always done modern medicine only. However, I realized my issues come from poor digestion. For example, I can have a quarter of a meal, feel full, as if my food gets stuck in my upper belly. This improves my appetite and digestion in about 2 weeks of consistent use (I won’t be plugging the brand unless someone asks for it)

·         **Gaviscon Advanced**

No lies said about this product, it just works. Take 10ml before bed, or during bad flareups take after meal. I tapered off nowadays and only take it when I have late night meals.

·         **Diet**

I wasn’t too strict super duper duper strict, just avoided high acid and LES weakening foods (Chocolate, Coffee, Mint, Spicy Food, Alcohol).

·         **Consistent daily timing of meals**

This is so important, I feel that our stomach has clocks. for example, that breakfasts should be around this time and lunch around this etc. Off timing meals cause indigestion, for me at least.

 

I do feel like im missing out a few things, but those are the ones that didn't work and im probably not trying to remember. I don’t really want to expand too much on my mental health during those periods, but it was one of the most depressing times in my life as nothing really made me happy anymore. But I do want to point out that **healing isn’t linear.** You can feel like after 2 weeks you’ve seen improvements but even if you didn’t make a mistake somehow it can be bad again. Just know that this doesn’t mean you’re not healing, its just one step back after you took already 2 steps forwards, just because its damaged again doesn’t mean there isnt any healing done. Although it’s easy to hyper fixate on this issue and I know its practically impossible to forget the symptoms because they are very real, but theres more to life than to worry over an issue that takes long to heal. Make sure you’re doing the right things and you’re already on the path to recovery, you can still enjoy other aspects of your life during this recovery period.  I’m not going to expand more on the things I went through unless asked as I believe seeing everyone else’s struggle is enough.

Im happy to try to reply to any comments because I know how much I needed help back then.",4,1764700672.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

Hi Reddit, I am a 63-year-old woman and until recently I thought I was just getting old and forgetful.

I live alone in the brick house I’ve owned for more than thirty years. I am a retired school secretary, widowed, and my only child “Terrence” (35M) and his wife “Monique” (early 30s) moved in last year “to help out” after my husband died.

At first, it really did feel like help. They did the heavy chores, took over some bills, and the house felt less empty. Then small things started to go wrong, and every time I questioned them, I ended up feeling crazy.

I’d find my keys in places that made no sense: once in the freezer, once floating in my birdbath outside. When I reacted, Terrence would say things like, “Mom, you’ve been looking for those for an hour, you don’t remember?” and give me this patient, pitying look.

I began waking up in strange places. I woke up on the couch with no memory of lying down, halfway down the hallway leaning against the wall, even sitting on the stairs with my head on the banister at six in the morning. Monique would say gently, “You must have been sleepwalking again, Mama Vance. You scared me.”

Every time I tried to insist that I had never sleepwalked in my life before, I got:

* “You’ve been under so much stress since Dad passed.”
* “You’re in your sixties now, Mom, this happens.”
* “The doctor said confusion can be normal at your age.”

For the record: my doctor never said I had dementia or anything like that. He said I was grieving and a bit depressed, but that my mind was sharp.

There was one common thread: the worst “episodes” always happened on nights when Monique brought me a big mug of her “special chamomile tea.” She would stand in my doorway and watch me drink it.

>

Within minutes, I’d be out cold and wake up ten hours later with a heavy head and fuzzy memories.

A few months ago, Terrence told me he was taking my keys “for safety.”

>

I felt like a child in my own house.

All of this is to explain why what my neighbor did next hit me so hard.

# The Whisper at the Fence

My neighbor, “Mrs. Gable” (late 60s), has lived next door for about twenty-five years. She has a yard full of roses and knows everything about everyone on the block.

A few nights ago, I was in my backyard in my robe, pretending to check my tomatoes just to get away from the tense feeling inside the house. My head felt foggy again, my tongue thick. I was wondering if maybe I really was slipping.

I heard her call my name softly.

She was on her side of the wooden fence, fussing with her roses. When Terrence stepped back inside, she moved closer. Her face looked serious in a way I had never seen before.

She kept pruning and in a very low voice said:

>

I almost started crying right there.

She went on:

>

I mumbled something about stress and age, and tried to repeat what the doctor had said.

She cut me off.

>

Before I could ask what she meant, my screen door opened. Terrence came out onto the porch, phone in hand.

Instantly, she raised her voice and started babbling about rose fertilizer like nothing was wrong. He smiled politely at her and then told me I shouldn’t be “out here alone” and that Monique was making my tea early because I’d been “so confused lately.”

I went back inside with my stomach tied in knots.

# The Tea

That night, around 9:30 PM, Monique brought the tray in just like always: big steaming mug of chamomile tea, small pill cup, and a cookie on the side.

She set it on my nightstand and said, in her sweet voice:

>

Terrence stood in the doorway behind her, arms crossed.

I picked up the mug, pretended to sip, and thanked them. When they finally left and the hallway went quiet, I took the tray into the bathroom, locked the door, and poured the tea down the sink with shaking hands.

I rinsed the mug, filled it with tap water so the weight would feel right, and took a loud sip so there would be traces on the rim. My heart was pounding like it wanted out of my chest.

I lay back in bed, turned off the light, and pretended to drift off.

Sure enough, a few minutes later I heard the door open softly.

Monique’s perfume hit first. She whispered:

>

Terrence said, “I told you. You worry too much.”

I forced my breathing to stay slow and heavy. My phone under the covers said 10:06 PM.

For the next two hours, I did the hardest thing I’ve done in a long time: I stayed awake on purpose.

Every time my eyes drooped, I pinched the soft skin inside my arm. I listened to the TV downstairs, to drawers opening and closing, to the fridge humming, to the old house sighing. Around 11:30 PM I heard something that sounded like my safe or a metal box.

About ten minutes before midnight, the TV shut off. There was low murmuring in the living room.

At exactly 12:00, my alarm buzzed quietly in my hand.

I got out of bed, walked to my bedroom door on bare feet, and slowly turned the knob. I opened it just a crack, like Mrs. Gable had told me.

# What I Saw

From my bedroom, I have a partial angle into the living room. It was lit by one lamp. On the wall where our family photos normally hang, the big framed wedding picture of Terrence and Monique was off the wall.

Behind it, the built-in wall safe my husband installed years ago was open.

Monique was sitting on the floor in front of it with my jewelry box open, little piles of gold and stones laid out on the coffee table. My mother’s ring. My sister’s bracelet. The earrings my husband bought me after Terrence was born.

There was a folder with papers that looked very familiar: my house deed, home insurance, pension information. I saw my name on the top of one sheet.

Terrence stood over her, hands in his pockets, watching calmly.

On the table, next to my jewelry, was a small white pharmacy bag.

Monique reached into it and pulled out a clear vial with a white label and a blister pack of pills. She spoke in this cold, practical tone I had never heard from her before.

She talked about how I already took heart medication, how the doctor thought I was “declining.” She said adding an extra “bump” of this liquid at night would make it look like my heart simply gave out in my sleep. She used the words “natural causes.”

She and Terrence discussed doing it “tomorrow night” so it would be a normal weekday, not a holiday. They talked about how they would react: how worried they would sound on the phone with 911, how they would cry, how everyone would see them as dutiful children who moved in to help.

They spoke openly about selling the house, cashing out my life insurance, leaving town.

At one point, Terrence said he was tired of “babysitting” me and that I “wasn’t really there anymore anyway.”

Standing there behind my cracked door, I realized the fog in my head wasn’t from age. It was from that tea.

And my son, my only child, was calmly planning how to end my life and call it grief.

I must have made some small noise, because Monique frowned and said they should check I was really asleep. She told Terrence to go make sure.

I closed my door as quietly and quickly as I could and relocked it, then stumbled back toward the bed. I barely had time to lie down, go limp, and let my mouth hang open before he tried the knob.

The lock held.

He called, “Mom? You okay? Need anything?” in his soft, loving voice.

I forced my tongue to feel heavy and mumbled, “So tired, baby… thank you… goodnight…”

There was a pause. Then he laughed and said, “Yeah, she’s out,” and walked away.

The second his footsteps faded, I knew I couldn’t stay in that bed a second longer.

# Escape

My bedroom window opens onto the small porch roof. Years ago, Terrence used it to sneak out. That night, I used it to escape.

I unlocked it, slid it open, and climbed out, heart hammering, knees shaking. The shingles scratched my palms. The night air was cold and sharp in my lungs.

I crawled to the corner where the old wooden trellis climbs up. I grabbed it with both hands and climbed down as carefully as I could, ivy scraping my legs, every creak making me sure it was about to snap. Somehow, it held.

When my feet hit the grass, I ran. In my nightgown, in my slippers, at midnight. I squeezed through the loose part of the chain-link fence between my yard and Mrs. Gable’s and pounded on her door like my life depended on it.

Because it did.

She opened the door in her house dress and headscarf, took one look at me, and pulled me inside.

>

I told her everything I’d just heard and seen, shaking so hard I could barely get the words out.

She didn’t waste time. She picked up the phone and said, “We’re calling the police right now.”

That’s where my original post ended. I was at her house, waiting for the officers, wondering if anyone would believe me or if they’d believe my son and his sweet-voiced wife.

# Update: “The police believed me. My son did not expect that.”

First, thank you to everyone who commented on my original post and told me I was not crazy. Reading those comments with my neighbor made me feel less alone.

A lot has happened since that night.

# The Police Response

When I called 911 from Mrs. G’s house, the operator took me seriously. I explained my age, my medications, the “sleepwalking,” the tea, and exactly what I overheard: the vial, the extra dose, the plan to make my death look natural.

The operator asked questions, then said officers were already on the way and told us to stay inside.

Within fifteen minutes, three patrol cars arrived. Two officers came to talk to us; the others went to my house.

I repeated the story. Mrs. G added what she had seen over the last few months: me stumbling around outside at dawn, Terrence taking trash out in the middle of the night, my personality changing whenever I started that “special tea.”

The officers then searched my house.

They found:

* The wall safe, open, with my jewelry and financial documents laid out.
* The pharmacy bag on the coffee table containing a vial and pills that were not on any of my prescriptions.
* Notes and papers where Monique had been writing down my medication schedule and “incidents of confusion.”

Later, they verified with my doctor that he had never prescribed anything like what was in that vial, and that he had not diagnosed me with dementia.

When officers confronted Terrence and Monique, they tried to say they were my caregivers and that I was “confused” and “paranoid.” They claimed the extra medication was something a different doctor suggested (a lie that took about five minutes to disprove).

Based on the evidence, they were both arrested on suspicion of attempted poisoning, elder abuse, and financial exploitation.

Standing across the street on my neighbor’s porch in a borrowed blanket, watching my son in handcuffs on my front lawn, was one of the strangest and saddest moments of my life.

He kept calling across the street:

>

I told him, loud enough for him and the officers to hear:

>

He looked shocked that anyone had believed me.

# Aftermath

The paramedics checked me out and recommended a hospital visit for bloodwork to see if there were any traces of whatever they had been slipping into my tea. I went, and while the tests are still being reviewed, the doctors said my vitals looked good and that I was coherent and oriented.

I spent the next several nights at Mrs. Gable’s house while my sister and a cousin came to stay with me. The locks on my house have been changed. My son no longer has access to my bank accounts or important documents. I am working with an elder law attorney to make sure no one can quietly add themselves back in.

Emotionally, I am a mess and clearer than I have been in months at the same time.

I keep replaying all the times I doubted myself because the people benefiting from my confusion insisted I was “mixed up.” I keep thinking about how easy it would have been for them to try one more time if I had drunk that tea.

My son and daughter-in-law are facing charges. I don’t know yet what the final legal outcome will be, but there is now a record, evidence, and a detective who believes me.

As for my neighbor: she saved my life. There is no other way to say it. If she hadn’t trusted her instincts enough to say something, I might not be here.

# Where Things Stand Now

I am back in my own house, but I am not living in it the same way.

The bedroom door locks from the inside because I choose it. I pour my own drinks. I see my doctor regularly and bring a friend or neighbor as a second pair of ears.

I do not know if I will ever speak to my son again. I am grieving him in a way that feels worse than a funeral because his body is still here, but the person I thought he was is gone.

But I am alive. I trusted that small voice that said, “Something is wrong,” and I ran toward the person who believed me.

If anyone reading this feels like they are being slowly written out of their own life and told it is “just age” or “just stress,” please listen to your gut. Especially when the people insisting you are confused stand to gain the most from your confusion.

I am not crazy. I am not confused.

I am still here.

1pcgfbg,https://i.redd.it/mkdbzngs2u4g1.jpeg,Add Brew Shot Timer to Machine,"UPDATE - I already see a flaw in my cabling for the solenoid.  I've got to figure out my work  around.  So I'll post and updated diagram in a bit.  
  
I posted earlier.  But after thinking about it more, I've updated my design.  I didnt get any feedback in the Electrician Sub.  And I'm pretty confident I've got the wiring plan correct.

Instead of keeping the old flip switch, this updated design has a three way rocker momentary contact.  Coincidentally it has I II and 0 for its markers.  I'll plan to use I for single shot, and II for double shot.

At Junction IC in the wiring diagram, I am removing the original brew switch, which will be replaced with what I'm showing.  Then to handle the timing I'll have to use two separate relays.  I'll have to do a lot of test brews to determine exactly how much time 1 shot vs 2 shots takes.  Although I'd love to hear from you all of what your typical brew time is from start to finish (not just when coffee begins to form).

I'll plan to hide the two relays in the middle space; which is where the solenoid sits.  Should be plenty of room for both of them.

Even though the original toggle switch breaks both neutral and hot for both the solenoid and pump, I'm just going to hard wire that leg together.  Breaking the one leg should be sufficient.

For those who hadnt seen my previous post, this is a gift for my wife.  She wanted it simplistic.  Rather than downgrading to a machine that does this, I'd rather make this unit do exactly what she wants.  Its certainly not going to give us Barrista perfect brews.  But it should give my wife what she wants.

Any thoughts?  Anyone with electronics/electrical knowledge see any flaws?

**Location:** District 7 Middle School, Olympus Mons, Mars  
**Time:** March 16, 2476, 06:00-20:00 (Hours 15.6-29.6)  
  
**06:00 - Morning Routine**

Lena Okafor arrived at District 7 Middle School forty-three minutes early, just as she had every Tuesday for fifteen years. The underground corridors of Olympus Mons Residential Level 4 hummed with their usual recycled air and artificial dawn lighting. Her coffee tasted wrong, somehow metallic, but the water processors had been acting up for weeks.

She unlocked Classroom 7-B and began her routine. Holographic projector on. Lesson plan loaded: ""Democratic Principles of the Colonial Alliance, Part 3: Consensus Through Discourse."" Thirty-two student desks arranged in a discussion circle, the way the curriculum guidelines recommended for ""fostering collaborative learning.""

The first anomaly: her connection to the Earth Historical Archives timed out. She tried twice more before switching to local cached content. It would do. Lesson 47-C on democratic principles wasn't exactly cutting-edge material.

The second anomaly: a system-wide alert banner scrolled across her display, *Alliance Strategic Command has elevated readiness status. Civil transport schedules may experience delays.* She dismissed it. Military exercises happened every few months.

Her wrist display chimed. Marcus, her thirteen-year-old son, from down the hall in 7-D: ""Mom, forgot lunch credits again.""

""Transferred,"" she replied, adding: ""And yes, you still have to attend my class third period.""

""Embarrassing.""

""Educational.""

Normal. Everything was normal.

**08:00 - First Period**

Twenty-eight students instead of thirty-two. The Lindqvist twins absent. Sofia Mbeki absent. Rana Osman absent.

""Flu going around,"" suggested Brendan from the third row.

Lena marked them absent and began. ""Yesterday we discussed the Alliance Charter of 2371. Today, we'll examine how democratic oversight prevents the concentration of power that led to the Imperial system on Earth.""

A hand raised. Dmitri, always eager. ""Ms. Okafor, my dad says the Empire isn't really Imperial anymore. He says the Emperor hasn't been seen in person for two years.""

""Your father works in shipping, doesn't he?"" Lena kept her voice neutral. ""We should be careful about unverified information. Let's focus on the historical principles...”

""But isn't that what democracy is supposed to prevent?"" Dmitri persisted. ""Hidden leadership? My dad says Blue Flame could be running everything and we wouldn't...”

""Your father's political opinions aren't curriculum, Dmitri.""

""He also says something happened on Earth last night. An explosion. He heard it from someone on the cargo runs.""

""There's always something happening on Earth,"" Lena said, steering back to the lesson. But she noticed others exchanging glances. They'd been talking on channels she couldn't monitor, sharing information she couldn't control.

**10:30 - Faculty Break Room**

""Can’t reach my husband since yesterday."" Biology teacher Marisa Huang clutched her coffee with both hands. ""He's stationed on Aurora. They said medical quarantine, but...”

""It's probably nothing,"" interrupted David Park from Mathematics. But his usual smile was forced. ""Remember when Ceres Station went dark for three days? Power grid failure.""

Lena poured her second wrong-tasting coffee. ""Anyone else having network issues? Can't reach Earth servers at all this morning.""

Silence. Then, quietly, from elderly Mr. Yamoto who taught Advanced Physics: ""There are no Earth servers. Haven't been since around midnight. Twelve hours now.""

""What do you mean, no Earth servers?""

""I mean the entire Earth data infrastructure is dark. Mars, Venus, Lunar, all functioning. Earth? Nothing. Just automated responses and redirects.""

""That's impossible,"" David said. ""We'd have heard...”

""From who?"" Yamoto's voice carried decades of disappointment. ""The news that requires Earth servers to broadcast?""

""My brother-in-law is with Alliance Strategic Command,"" said gym teacher Kofi Asante, who rarely spoke at faculty meetings. ""He messaged this morning. They've pulled all forward units back to defensive positions. Something about Mercury, ships they didn't know about.""

""Mercury?"" Marisa looked up. ""The Triumvirate? They don't have military ships.""

""Apparently they do now.""

Principal Harrison entered, ending the conversation. His face was pale. ""Staff meeting, immediately. Classroom management protocols only. Nothing that might cause panic.""

""Panic about what?"" Lena asked.

""Luna just went dark.""

""What?""

""Protocol Seven-Seven. Complete severance. No trade, no transit, no communication. They've closed the doors."" Harrison's voice cracked. ""All Helium-3 shipments are frozen. They're broadcasting on emergency channels only.""

The faculty break room went silent. Everyone knew what Luna's Helium-3 meant. Without it, fusion reactors failed. Without fusion, stations died.

""We're to maintain routine,"" Harrison continued. ""That's what we can control. That's what we do.""

""Maintain routine while Luna...” David started.

""*Exactly.* Nothing that might cause panic. Are we clear?""

**12:00 - Third Period - Marcus's Class**

Thirty students this time. The Lindqvist twins were back. They sat perfectly still, backs straight, eyes forward. Lena had never seen thirteen-year-olds sit so still.

""Welcome back, Mira, Erik. Feeling better?""

""Yes, Ms. Okafor,"" they said in unison. Not unusual for twins, except for the half-second delay, like one voice echoing.

She began the lesson. ""Who can tell me the three pillars of Alliance democracy?""

Marcus raised his hand, bless him. Playing the good son. ""Transparency, accountability, and representation.""

""Excellent. And why transparency?""

""Because hidden power corrupts,"" Sofia Mbeki said from the doorway. She walked to her seat with strange precision, each step exactly the same length. ""But what if transparency is an illusion? What if showing everything is just another way of hiding what matters?""

""That's... an interesting philosophical question, Sofia. But...”

""It's not philosophical."" Sofia's voice was calm, certain. ""The Alliance showed us everything except the twenty-three frigates Mercury built. The Empire showed us the Emperor except he's been Stage Eight for three months. Transparency is just choosing which lies to make visible.""

The class was silent. Lena felt the air change, that moment when children realize adults don't have answers.

""Sofia, where did you...”

""We can feel them thinking,"" Erik Lindqvist said suddenly. ""All of them. Thinking together.""

Mira nodded. ""It's beautiful. Like music made of thoughts.""

""Who?"" Lena kept her voice steady. ""Who's thinking?""

""Everyone,"" the twins said together. ""Everyone who's begun.""

Marcus was staring at his classmates. ""Mom?""

""Continue with page 247,"" Lena said automatically. ""I need to speak with the Principal.""

**14:30 - Emergency Faculty Meeting**

Principal Harrison's face had aged years in hours. ""I've been instructed to maintain normal operations.""

""Instructed by who?"" demanded Marisa. ""My husband's station is dark! Luna's cut us off!""

""By the Colonial Education Authority. We're to maintain routine. Parents have been notified that transport systems are temporarily restricted. Students will remain until normal dismissal.""

""This is insane,"" David said. ""There are Triumvirate ships surrounding the station networks. Luna's embargoed everyone's Helium-3. The newsfeeds are saying there was a nuclear explosion on Earth, *nuclear*, Harrison. And the children know something's wrong.""

""A nuclear explosion where?"" Lena asked.

""Somewhere in Mesopotamia. Ur. Blue Flame garrison, they're saying. Nobody knows who...” David shook his head. ""The official channels are calling it 'unverified reports.'""

Mr. Yamoto stood slowly. ""My granddaughter is on The Wheel of Fortune station. Thirty minutes ago, she sent me a message: 'We are becoming.' Then nothing.""

""We maintain routine,"" Harrison repeated. ""That's what we can control. That's what we do.""

""Even if it's a lie?"" Lena asked.

""Especially then.""

**16:00 - Fifth Period - Advanced Colonial Studies**

Seven students absent. The remaining eighteen sat in unusual patterns, three groups of three, perfectly spaced, and nine individuals. The groups of three breathed in synchronization.

Lena taught about the Venus Accords. About compromise and negotiation. About the strength of diverse opinions.

One of the synchronized groups, she couldn't tell them apart anymore, raised their hands simultaneously. ""Ms. Okafor, why is diversity better than unity?""

""Because different perspectives lead to better decisions.""

""But doesn't that assume the perspectives are actually different? What if democracy is just the same thought arguing with itself in different voices?""

She had no answer. The traditional response about marketplace of ideas felt hollow when three students were clearly sharing one mind.

Her wrist display showed seventeen messages from parents. She didn't read them.

**18:00 - After School**

The building was nearly empty. Marcus helped her clean the classroom, their tradition since he was small.

""Mom, are we going to be okay?""

She wanted to lie. Parents were supposed to lie at moments like this. ""I don't know.""

""The Lindqvist twins... they're different.""

""I know.""

""Are we going to become like them?""

Lena pulled him close. ""Not today.""

""But eventually?""

She didn't answer. On the board, she wrote tomorrow's date and assignment: ""Chapter 48: The Role of Opposition in Democracy.""

""Why?"" Marcus asked. ""Why prepare for tomorrow?""

""Because that's what humans do. We prepare for tomorrow even when, especially when, we're not sure it will come.""

**20:00 - Last Light**

They walked home through Level 4's artificial evening. The corridors were emptier than usual but not abandoned. People moved with purpose, shopping for dinner, returning from work. Maintaining.

At the tram station, a news display cycled through local weather reports and sports scores. Below the normal content, an emergency banner: *LUNAR PROTOCOL SEVEN-SEVEN ACTIVE - TRADE SUSPENSION CONFIRMED - STRATEGIC COMMAND ADVISES CALM*. Nothing else. Nothing about Aurora Station. Nothing about the nuclear strike. Nothing about Triumvirate ships. Nothing about Earth's silence.

A security officer stood by the platform, plasma rifle visible but not raised. His eyes tracked everyone but his face remained calm. Professional normal.

On the tram, a young girl, maybe six, tugged her mother's sleeve. ""Mommy, the whisper people say tomorrow will be different.""

""Hush, dear.""

""But they're not scary. They say it will be like sharing dreams.""

The mother pulled her closer, met Lena's eyes across the car. The look between parents: *We don't know how to protect them from this.*

At home, Lena made dinner. Helped Marcus with homework from other classes. Watched him struggle with Advanced Mathematics while the world transformed around them.

""Mom,"" he said suddenly. ""If everyone becomes connected, will we still need teachers?""

She considered lying. Chose truth. ""I don't know. But until we find out, I'll keep teaching.""

""Even if it doesn't matter?""

""Especially then. Sometimes doing normal things is the only rebellion we have left.""

That night, she prepared Wednesday's lesson. The Role of Opposition in Democracy. She wrote discussion questions she might never ask, prepared materials for students who might not come.

Outside their apartment, she could hear neighbors doing the same, living their normal lives with desperate intensity. Somewhere above them, beyond the rock of Olympus Mons, Luna sat in self-imposed isolation, fleets gathered, and humanity's future was being decided.

But in District 7, Level 4, Apartment 7-B-4, a mother helped her son with homework and prepared for tomorrow's classes.

It was the last normal thing she could do.

It was everything.

We are foodies, like coffee/bakeries, wine, being near water, nature and just experiencing the culture of new countries in general. Looking for somewhere that’s fairly easy to travel around as well. Easy public transport between cities and things like that.

Some guys will even cope to say stuff like my masculine presence over time decrease so therefore she felt bored in the relationship. I get this but lets be honest, we are human at the end of the day. 

Not only that, we say view women as human yet we default to seeing them as an angel in times of distress. Its another way to blame a man again. Its the man fault for putting a woman on the pedestal but its his fault for not being the ideal boyfriend. I am not blaming women, this post is really directed toward men who respond this way. But what part in a relationship does a women have control over?

I will give you an example in my relationship. I had an ex for 8 months. At first, we dated causally. I told her that we will see where it goes and I dont rush into commitment. She was ok with that. Eventually, she tried to seduce me into commitment by cooking for me and wearing provocatively clothing. 

I decided to do it because I never had a gf and she seem to care. Once she became my gf, she changed. Now she never cooked for me claiming it took to much time and money. She literally was a teacher with no job in the summer. She got pension over the summer so she had the time lol. I found out that she had oral herpes, 16k in credit card debt, and that she had pelvic issues so she didnt want to have sex constantly. 

Most of the time, I was pleasing her in the bedroom and she rarely pleased me stating it isnt masculine for a woman to be on top. She expected me to always initiate, pay for dates, and text her good morning. I took her to chicago and a steak restuarant about 6 months in. And no, I dont just do that for women. I did it since we were getting close and I wanted to do a fancy date myself. She couldnt even buy me a coffee in Chicago or things from a gift shop. At that point, I was ready to end the relationship. 

She also was super insecure about female friends. I had one girl that I previously like, text me. She has a bf and I assure my gf that we never hang out or flirt. She was a classmate as well so we were texting about school. She freak out. She constantly ask who was I talking to and ultimately she broke up with me claiming I wasnt masculine enough and I am too lustful. She said that because I had pictures of sabrina carpenter on my FYP. 

She then went on tik tok claiming I was a toxic ex. I say all that to say, family still blame me. I had people trying to gaslight me into believing I did something wrong. Even when I explain the story, people look at me funny thinking its weird that she cooked for me. Yet, no ask what did she do for me. 

I am in med school and still made time to see her everyday or call her. I plan dates weekly. Literally crash my car due to tiredness. I have never made those mistakes being single and I have done dumb things. Yet in my relationship I was constantly tired. I easily sleeping 10 hrs a day. Yet Im the bad guy and I must have been arrogant because I am a doctor. Or I dont have time for a relationship lol. Or I was a beta male simp who try to buy love. Could it also just be she was the problem too? She also didnt know how to be a gf. No, it totally all me. ",0,1764699816.0,AskMenAdvice,103,0.5,False

Yung Ice tea, juice ko… parang d ko mainom.. pero ayos naman ung chicken skin nila at coffee jelly. 

Gonna rate the food at 6/10. Pwede na sa halagang 32 kaso kung may budget ka naman, mag hot palayok ka na lang. 

Kaya pala halos kasabay namin kumain, ung mukha hindi maipinta.

Rant lang.

I am a 24 year old female, and have been going to the gym consistently since March 2024. I previously lost 50 pounds and kept the weight off for about 4 years now, but I never have gone to the gym until recently. I need some tips to see more progress, or maybe tweak my routine.

I have been focusing more on lifting with some cardio, using progressive overload to get stronger. I eat about 130-150 grams of protein everyday, and I weigh 152 pounds and I’m 5’7. I take 5 g of creatine everyday, and one pill of L-carnitine. I cut out all processed proteins, focusing on getting it from food sources like fish, chicken steak and Greek yogurt primarily. I also recently cut out sugar, it has been 2 weeks doing that so far. Greatly increased my water intake and cut back on caffeine (I used to drink 2 coffees and a Celsius everyday, now I’m down to one cup of coffee in the morning.) I take a probiotic and multivitamin as well every night. 

One thing I am surprised about, is although I am eating significantly more than I used to, my weight has stayed the same. I used to be terrified of eating more than one 
 meal a day, and now I eat 3-4 high protein meals a day. But for some reason with the gym, my weight just feels stagnant. I have tried a calorie deficit, eating 1200-1300 calories a day and I use chat gpt to track every calorie I eat throughout the day, but I eventually stopped because I heard being in a calorie deficit for longer than a few months is no longer a deficit. I’ll also add that I eat no fast food, I cut out junk food, I don’t have sugary drinks, and only really drink water and coffee. I cut all these things out permanently since my initial weight loss journey about 4 years ago. 

Basically, on paper I feel like I have a good routine. However I feel like I’m not seeing the progress that I should be. I definitely feel some parts of stubborn fat that I struggle with (my lower belly, back fat and armpit fat) reducing slightly, but I still feel extremely skinny fat. I would like some tips, or to see if I’m possibly doing something wrong. I really have been trying to focus on my glutes and stomach, since those are insecurities that I do have, especially after losing weight. But I train all parts of my body equally throughout the week.

1pcfz7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pcfz7r/how_to_decide_between_smart_light_bulbs_and_smart/,How to decide between smart light bulbs and smart outlets?,"You've probably heard about smart home tech and wondered which option works better for your space. The choice between smart light bulbs and smart outlets comes down to what you need and how you want to control your lighting.

**What's the Basic Difference?**

Smart light bulbs connect directly to your WiFi or smart home hub. You screw them into regular light fixtures and control them through an app. Smart outlets plug into your existing wall sockets and let you control whatever device you plug into them.

**When Smart Light Bulbs Make More Sense**

If you want to change colors or dim your lights, smart bulbs are the way to go. They give you total control over brightness and color temperature. You can set different moods for movie nights, reading, or just hanging out. Most smart bulbs let you schedule when lights turn on and off, which helps save energy.

Smart bulbs work great in table lamps, ceiling fixtures, and places where you want more than just basic on-off control. They're perfect for bedrooms, living rooms, and anywhere you spend a lot of time. Plus, you don't need to mess with any electrical outlets.

**When Smart Outlets Are Better**

Smart outlets make sense when you want to control things other than just lights. You can plug in fans, coffee makers, or holiday decorations. They're cheaper than buying multiple smart bulbs, especially if you have lamps with several bulbs.

The downside? You can't dim lights or change colors with smart outlets. They only turn things on and off. Also, if someone switches off the lamp manually, the smart outlet can't turn it back on.

**Which Should You Pick?**

Think about your budget first. Smart outlets usually cost less upfront, but smart bulbs give you more features. If you rent your place, smart bulbs are easier since you can take them when you move.

For most people, smart light bulbs offer better value because of the dimming and color options. They work in any fixture and give you the most flexibility. You can check out different options for [smart light bulbs](https://athomewave.com/smart-light-bulbs) that fit various budgets and needs.

**Making It Work Together**

You don't have to choose just one. Many people use smart bulbs in their main living areas and smart outlets for other devices. This combo gives you full control without spending too much money.

The key is starting small. Get a couple of [smart light bulbs](https://athomewave.com/smart-light-bulbs) for the rooms you use most. See how you like controlling them before you buy more. You can always add smart outlets later for other stuff around your house.

Both options work with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home, so you can control everything with simple commands. Your choice really depends on whether you want fancy lighting features or basic power control for different devices.",1,1764699493.0,Amazontly,0,1.0,False

There s this girl ive been interested in since june. It was a school trip and we gave each other looks on the first night when we all hung out. On the second night we ended up drinking in a smaller group, we talked one on one for hours and i did feel a spark and im pretty sure it was the same for her. She gave me signs, we  ended up cuddling each other to sleep and it felt amazing. For the next 3 weeks we talked non stop. After that we stopped talking since it was summer break and we couldnt see each other. Now, in september after months of no contact we bumped into each other and set up a date to grab a coffee together. It was a little weird but this confirmed me that i am still crushing on her. A week after we went to the birthday party of her best friend where out of 5 people we were the only 2 not drunk. Same story, looks, touches, one on one conversations. Night ended with a kiss while we were watching movies in bed. Cant lie, highlight of my relationship history but of course dreams dont last. Same story, talked 24/7 for weeks but since this was during the school year we went to coffee almost every day. Video calls at night, dates in the day. It was pretry obvious what was happening but we never called it out. Now, 2 weeks ago out of nowhere she ghosted me, like, literally out of nowhere. It was much harder to get my mind off her this time because i actually tought we were getting somehwere. Found out from someone she is talking to someone.
From my point of view, she isnt cheating because we were never in a relationship, but what i do think is that she wanted to distance herself from me for some reason. Very confusing time because we went from 0 to 100 3 times already and as i said its harder for me to just forget about her this time. Anyone advice or personal opinion on the situation would be very appreciated🙏",0,1764699415.0,Crushes,1,0.5,False
