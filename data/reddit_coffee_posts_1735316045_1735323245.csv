1hnkxnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1hnkxnu/discovered_this_sub_when_first_learning_my_gf_has/,Discovered this sub when first learning my gf has BPD. Foolishly chose to ignore it,"31M here entered into my first relationship about 3 months ago. She hinted early that she had a mental health diagnosis and would eventually describe it indicating she needed time to get comfortable to reveal her diagnosis. I had never heard of BPD until coincidentally during one of our first arguments 1 month in, I saw a Reddit post about a relationship issue in which the comments mentioned BPD. After reading into it, I knew right away that’s what she had, and of course a few weeks later she eventually told me that she has BPD. 

During that argument, I stumbled upon this sub. Initially I was very concerned about what a lot of these anecdotes meant about the potential of my relationship… but soon I told myself that this community was just one negative echo chamber. I told myself I shouldn’t let any of this cloud my view and should just move forward independently on my own accord. 

Of course my girlfriend would be the rare scenario of someone with BPD high functioning enough to sustain a successful healthy long term relationship with me, and I was totally prepared to navigate her issues! /s

Now here I am, dumped on Christmas and heartbroken and it’s so obvious how the writing was on the wall. So I just want to share my story in case it helps someone else understand what they’re dealing with. Sorry for this massive post lol, in a way I also just feel the need to vent and really document my reflection on the relationship.

3 months ago we matched on Hinge and within the first few messages our banter led to agreeing on a date. I had only gone on a few dates before this so I was on cloud 9 and got a massive boost to my confidence from how smoothly and quickly she agreed to a date, I saw this as a sign that we must be really compatible. We joke about her liking princess treatment so she puts me in her contacts as Prince.

The first date goes really well, of course she got into really deep topics about her trauma and the abuse at the hands of her narcissistic mom, telling a story about how her energy ring broke when she was around her narcissistic cousin, etc. But we had a good time and quickly have a second date a few days later, it felt magical that we both had in mind an idea for that second date based on a throwaway comment from our first date. Second date goes great.

Then we plan a third date for the following weekend, but before then she mentions how she has such a good feeling about us that she had deleted her dating apps already. This made me nervous because I didn’t anticipate things going this quickly, but of course I ended up deciding this was a sign that she was the one and also deleted my apps. Third date goes great. Up to this point we had only hugged but on this date she initiated a kiss and then told me she expects me to ask her to make it official. I again thought this was very quick but was so overjoyed by the situation that I went along with it and we made it official. This was all within 12 days of our first date.

First few weeks of being officially in a relationship were great. We see each other 3 times a week and are texting/calling all the time. She tells me if it was up to her she’d want to see me everyday. We have a weekend away together in which she posts an IG story referring to me as her soulmate. She tells me we’ll be together forever and that the only way she’d ever leave me would be if I cheated. We have discussions about marriage and future children, discuss plans for next year to visit her family out of state. I buy us tickets for a stand up comedy show next April at her request. A lot of this is ringing alarm bells in my head but I quickly dismiss it, she does a good job at being semi-joking when she makes these grandiose comments about our future so I don’t find it as jarring as it actually was.

We have a lot of fun, although many of our conversations are her venting about her issues and me just trying to be a good listener. But I’m so infatuated that I’m fine with this. She has issues with so many of her relatives, her best friend that she speaks so lovingly about apparently a few years ago the had a big falling out and stopped talking for a year. Her long term career and life ambitions are erratic and constantly changing. One day she wants to move out of state later next year and convincing me why we could make long distance work. The next day she wants to stay in our current area just away from her family.

Eventually the “if it was up to me we’d see each other day” becomes “I’m so busy with work (even though she works part time)” I don’t think I can do dates on weeknights anymore”. Even though I’m the one who drove 40 minutes to her all the time and we had our dates within 5-10 minutes of her place, in which I paid for everything.

She occasionally makes paranoid comments about my potential for cheating. Asks to know who all the women on my IG are. Meanwhile this is my first relationship and I don’t think I could cheat if I even wanted to. She has so many more friends and followers of the opposite gender than I do.

We get into our first argument one day where she asks to see my IG For You page and sees a few videos of attractive girls. I’m new to IG and legitimately had never used it to seek out sexual content. During that argument, she semi-jokingly threatens to go flirt with other guys at the bar we’re at so I’d know how it feels. She later accuses me of gaslighting her for standing my ground that I’ve done nothing inappropriate.

On this same date, earlier I was sitting there with nothing to do for a few minutes while she was texting another guy who literally had Hinge in his contact info. I hadn’t even seen her phone, she volunteered bringing this up and explained how that was someone who she had gone on one date with a while ago but they decided to be friends. Yet here she is texting him while we’re on a date, as he’s confiding in her about how he just ended his relationship. Oh and during that same date she posts an IG story jokingly (?) talking about how she wants to sell feet pics. But I’M the bad guy for an IG model coming up on my For You page.

We eventually get through that argument, and I’m legitimately impressed at the mature and sympathetic dialogue we had to get through it. This is around the time I learned what BPD was so this gave me confidence that we could work through it. And to be clear despite the crazy details above, things mostly were still very good. I start to almost pity her for the abuse she went through and feel bonded by being able to support her. Even though this “abuse” she describes is often relatively minor things in my view. Meanwhile as I’m constantly supporting her and asking about her issues, one day when my pet was going through a surgery that I had expressed to her I was stressed about, she didn’t even ask how he was. She did much later that day after first talking about her own issues, almost as if she realized she was putting on a mask and pretending to care because she felt she was supposed to, rather than genuine empathy or concern.

And then came a few lulls where she’d get cold and distant. Still communicating but only short texts sporadically instead of the consistent deep communication we had. Then a few days later she’d be back with a lot of energy and affection. When I asked her about one of these shifts in her energy and wanted to discuss how it makes me feel anxious and insecure about her desire to make this relationship work, she gaslit me into saying that I was reading too much into things and everything was fine. 

Despite all this, when in person things are consistently great. Lots of fun and affection, talks about our future. She gets excited about imminent plans to meet my family. At one point jokes about how we should speed things up, how she expects a proposal within a year.

Then suddenly she cancels on those plans to meet family. And now suddenly “Hey we’ve moved really quickly, we should reel things back to reality and slow our pace”. Still talking about us long term and reassuring me that she’s invested, but then at one point almost pointing the finger at me like I was the one who sped things up too much, almost insinuating nefarious intentions on my part. Even though clearly she led the fast pace of our relationship the whole way through.

Our last date went amazing and I thought we were in a really good space, both having solid dialogue and understanding about the pace of our relationship. She again confirms if I’m still interested in plans to see her family next May. She is visibly giddy at the physical affection between us.

Then suddenly the next few days she goes ultra cold and distant, 1-2 sentence responses to my texts just once a day each morning as if it’s some scheduled chore to respond to me. I obviously sense this but figure just give her space and reassure her that I’m here for. But part of me is starting to get fed up with these shifts in energy and unwillingness to communicate and hopes she breaks up with me, because I knew I didn’t have the confidence to be the one to call it quits

Xmas comes around and she just gives a heart emoji reaction to my Christmas present (a Cameo from a character from her favorite TV show) and cancels on our upcoming date without much explanation. Next morning she asks if we can have coffee and “talk about us”, but sensing this was a breakup I didn’t want to even meet in person, so we just texted. She questions our long term compatibility and specifically cites a lack of physical touch and says our intimacy was struggling. Even though nothing she said or did had indicated that, she always outwardly seemed so happy and giddy about the affection between us, and that affection would only diminish when she chose to be distant. She didn’t want to work on it, seemed settled that we’re not compatible.

Overall the conversation of the breakup was very respectful and we both expressed well wishes, in a vacuum her decision to end the relationship is totally fine. Truly we did only know each other for a few months so of course she’s not obligated to try to make things work if she just doesn’t feel that spark or whatever. It’s just in the context of everything else, how she made me feel for so much of our relationship like there WAS an intense spark, just has me in a pretty mindfucked and hurt place.

In the 24 hours since I go through “Good riddance, clearly this was going to be a train wreck and I’m so grateful it ended before doing too much damage. I’m going to be fine and this gave me great experience to eventually find a healthy relationship that works for me” to “I’m never going to feel that level of intense affection again, I miss her, I’m never going to find anyone else, I’m empty”. And back and forth. Rationally I know that this second viewpoint is not healthy or valid, but it’s still there. I think I’ll be okay, but shit it hurts.

Also to be clear, I don’t want to demonize her. Of course I wrote the most egregious things, but even with the rose tinted glasses off I can still genuinely say there was a lot of good too. What felt like genuine affection and support and empathy and fun.

I don’t think she ever meant to hurt me, I think she truly felt that intensely in the beginning, and then the reality of us as just two humans trying to make a relationship work instead of a fairytale love story isn’t something she’s equipped to deal with. Other than the emotional rollercoaster about our relationship and some minor hypocrisy and unfounded paranoia, I don’t think her BPD ever really manifested directly against me. She never got angry with me or insulted me, even during the breakup she stayed very kind and respectful. But I can’t help but feel like I dodged several bullets and that if we did stretch this relationship longer with more emotional investment, it would have been inevitable for her personality to eventually hurt me more directly.

I do hope she finds sustained happiness, I’m just unfortunately pessimistic that she’s capable of it.",1,1735322974.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1hnkw38,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1hnkw38/i_think_shes_way_out_of_my_league/,I think she's way out of my league,"I 26F started seeing this girl 24F few months ago. I'm pretty introverted but my best friend got me to go out in a club one friday, and I meet her there, as we were in same group. She's close friend off one off my friends, and as soon as I saw her my jaw was on the floor. She was dressed in small black dress and high heels, she's 5""9 without heels (while I'm 5""3) but she looks so sexy when she wears them. Also her meakup was perfect and long hair in high ponytail, with her small fancy purse, she was flawless. She's kind off woman that comes straight out off some wattpad fanfiction, or romance movie. I immediatly noticed how whole club knew her, and every few minutes there was someone coming to our table to say hi to her. That was all a bit to much for me, as I don't like crowds and it made me really anxious so I went out to get some air. She went out minute after me and she lead me behinde the club, where there was literaly no one. She was standing next to me just smoking and waiting for me to calm down, and I'm not for cigarettes but there's something so sexy about the way she does it. She started some small talk with me and in the end we stayed outside for whole hour just talking, until one off our friends came to get us back inside. For whole night she was making sure I'm alright and if something is making me uncomfortable, and her friends were asking if she's sick cause she was slacking with drinking. When we were all going home she told me how she's glad she meet me and she gave me her number and I gave her mine.

Next day my friends were all teasing me how CEO fell for me, and how I'm new target off famous womanizer. It turned out that she owns a company 50/50 with her brother. Her instagram has way to many followers and her face shows up on google when you write her name. And they told me how she's out as lesbian and she also had high profile ex girlfriend that she was with for 3 years, but they brokeup cause one off them cheated. She also has reputation off rich brat, fuckgirl and party animal. But then she started to hang out more with my group off friends and she was sweetest most normal human ever. After few times that we hang out she told me how she's interestes in me and how she would like to take me out on a date. And I didn't even think before saying yes, she's literaly everything that I ever wanted in a girl.

We started going out four months ago, and she would call me to have movie dates at her place, where she would cuddle me whole night without any attention to sleep with me. She would make me food and coffee while I would study late for my exams. She would take me to college and pick me up even if she was late to her work. She buys me flowers and new plushie every week. And for my birthday she rented us a house in mountains in middle off nowhere, and she put flowers in jacuzzi and she made scene like out off movie. First time we sleept together she aaked me five times if I want it, and she made sure I'm comfortable with everything that we did. On Christmas  Eve we were hanging out at her place when her parents called her to go decorate a Christmas  tree,  without any hesitation she asked me to go with her. When we got there she introduced me as her person. Everything she does is perfect and I'm just not sure I can give her same treatment that she's giving me.

Last night we were heavily making out, and I told her in middle off it that she's making me mad. She got scared and asked what is she doing wrong. And I told her that she's making me mad because she's so perfect and because I want her on so many levels. She asked me what I really want from her, and I told her that I want relationship with her. She told me that she doesn't see problem with that. But I told her that I can't and that I have my own doubts when it comes to all off this. She was asking me half an hour if she did everything wrong and if she hurted me with anything, but I was just saying no to her so she gave up. She went out on balcony and smoked out her cigarette and I could tell she was frustrated,  but after her cigarette break she came back inside and we acted like nothing happened. 

I know that I'm making her frustrated, and she told me that I'm hot/cold a lot with her. But I juat don't know if I deserve her. She's perfect, beautiful, smart, rich and has her life under control. While on the other hand I'm average at best. I'm in college for way to long as I'm failling some subjects, and I'm repeating same year for second time now, I have nowhere near her money and I'm not even close in looks when it comes to her ex girlfriend. And I just don't want people to say that she could have better cause I know that she can have better. But I also want her so so bad.",0,1735322861.0,LesbianActually,0,0.5,False

1hnkvat,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hnkvat/why_do_young_women_not_break_free_from/,Why do young women not break free from expectations these days?,"I read, see, and hear so many women complaining about how their men do nothing when it comes to laundry, hosting, cleaning, scheduling, kids, etc. Sometimes men say it will get done later or there's no need to stress just relax.

Why not take their lead? I know personally at first when I mentioned the idea my friends said yeah but then it won't get done. That's the point. Yes it's not easy, you feel guilty, especially when it comes to kids or hearing comments from your relatives or in-laws about why you didn't do something and your husband works harder (because no one understands women also work full time) but it's worth it.

For example my partner and I travel a lot both solo and together. He always packs 30 minutes before whether it's an overnight trip or a 3 month trek. He has forgotten underwear, shirts, socks, shaving, etc. His family makes comments it's my job to pack his suitcase. I work full time and he has flexibility with his work and will chill for hours leading up to his trip with plenty of time to pack. Not my job. He's never complained to me because he knows it's his job to pack. I've only helped him once and he didn't even ask I could see he was stressed and busy with work and no time to pack so of course I'll be supportive then.

When his in laws visit I'd bust my ass cleaning and planning and he would say why are you stressing my parents won't care. All it took was one visit where I decided to take him up on that and he realized as his parents walked in the door that the house was a disaster and no plans were made. He was fielding comments from his parents. You bet now he's cleaning a few days before and discussing with me what we will be doing/eating before they get there now. 

Laundry? Super easy why do I stress. Every time I leave his for him to do he runs our of clothes as to rewear something, puts them in the wash,  forgets them for a few days and has to rewash to dry them and sometimes forgets again. Then he forgets they are in the dryer when it's time for his new outfit. He has never asked me to do laundry but I do his now and he gives me a big hug and kiss every time and says thank you because he knows remembering to take the load out and in, fold clothes, put away is a lot of work when we are already juggling the rest of our adult life errands lol.

 I always plan all the food for camping trips and was stressed. He told me it was simple and I was making a big deal I said okay you handle it. He was happy to show me. It was funny when we each got ¼ of coffee for the entire weekend and our friends were irritated when they realized that's all he packed, a ration of one hotdog per person (no buns). Everyone complained and he was annoyed but I said hey he was in charge of food. Now he delegates to someone else.

He said kids are easy and didn't know why his sister was stressed with hers. I watched him take 30 minutes to buckle all three of them in the car this weekend and keep track of them for the day. I didn't lift a finger. You bet he looked at me at the end of the day and laughed saying okay. Nevermind. And that was a tear free,  no melt down day with them too. I can see things clicking in his head once he experiences the world through my eyes.

Let things fall apart. Men will figure it out. They won't if you tell or show them. It all looks easy. Once they do it themselves they get it. And if your guy blames you for things falling apart or work delegated to him he didn't complete then he's not the one.

And yes I still get comments from in-laws and parents but I don't care. No I'm not going to the kitchen with the other older women to wash dishes. I'll watch the game with you. I love that most women my age do this now and at parties it's the husband and wife that hosted are equally cleaning up in my age range. Annoys me so much with the older generation that's 45+ and all the women are ALWAYS working. ",2,1735322804.0,rant,0,1.0,False

Things have gotten worse since then on other fronts. 

My husband and I have been frustrated/on edge since then. His family is very high energy and loud and we are both quiet people. Whenever we have tried to get away for a half hour to do something on our own (like read a book in our room in the evening) there are a lot of questions from his family about why we are not spending time with them. We have been spending 11+ hours straight with them since we came here on the 23rd and are going to be here four more days. We have mostly been sitting around drinking coffee and chatting. 

My husband was already on edge this morning as last night we went to a diner his family was talking up. They said the owner was super entertaining. The owner came out while we were there and was telling all sort of stories and was dropping anti-Semitic comments and racial slurs, including the n-word with a hard r at the end. This side of the family is white but my husband is half-black so naturally this upset him and his family was just laughing for the rest of the guy’s stories and asked us afterwards if we enjoyed it and talked about what a nice guy the owner was, giving back to the community and such with some charity or whatever. We ended up going straight to bed after we got home as my husband was upset and I’ve picked up a nasty cold. His grandma was upset we went to bed early (it was around 9:30). 

Well, this morning things got worse. I have family that lives a few hours away and they are going to drive down and meet us in the middle for lunch at a big local restaurant this weekend  (it’s a cultural institution of the area). My uncle was arranging it and asked for my input along the way and my husband’s whole family agree to come. This morning we found out from my uncle that due to the size of our group the restaurant is requiring we do the buffet and pay a set price of 30 dollars per person. I told my husband’s family and his grandmother, aunt, and sister said they no longer wanted to come as one is vegetarian and didn’t want pay full price at the buffet if she couldn’t eat the meat, and the other two didn’t like the buffet. This turned into them saying just my husband and I should go all alone, making the reservation none less people. I was a bit upset about this as this had been the plan for a week to go and my uncle had to spend some time calling to do the reservation (the restaurant is busy and hard to get ahold of). I told my husband I was upset about them changing the plans (I was just venting) and I think this was the straw that broke the camel’s back. He went and told his family (in a calm way!) that he was upset they would change plans. 

They now said the reason they didn’t want to the buffet was because it was too expensive at 30 dollars. He said we would have paid if they told us that. His sister was not listening and kept butting in and saying the buffet was ridiculous and so on. 

My husband got upset and was ready to pack and leave for a hotel because he felt like his family was making him the bad guy. They said he was stressing out his grandmother and ruining Christmas because he told them they shouldn’t have cancelled and because we went to bed early yesterday. I calmed him down and I guess he smoothed things over kind of with his family so we are still staying here. I just feel so self conscious now because he told them I was upset and I feel they are giving me the cold shoulder (his sister and aunt went into the other room when I came down to sit at the table and now all of the women in the house have left to go to the store, leaving just me here with my husband and the men. They didn’t offer to take me). I don’t know what to do right now. I don’t know what I’m asking for here. ",1,1735322791.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

My whole life, I was surrounded by women who had easy pregnancies, like my mum and older sister. For them, being pregnant was a breeze, a joy ride. They never complained and their labors were less then 7h. Many of my friends also  thankfully had easy pregnancies (or they just never complained, not sure).

Due to this, I had this mindset that too many women treat pregnancy like a disease and an excuse. They choose not to do anything, even though they can. They are just pregnant, not sick! You can't go to the store 5min from you? Really? Running an errand is to inconvenient? Come on! Helping around the house is too much? I mean, you must be joking. How hard is to cook a lunch when all you do all day is sit at your ass at home.

Oh stupid, stupid me! Life slapped me and it slapped me hard, rightfully! While I do have an easy pregnancy and quite uneventful, I do have days with really bad back pain. Vacuuming my 1 bedroom apartment is a chore after which I need a 10 min break to catch my breath. Some days, I am so tired that I can't concentrate on a simple task, let alone my work or cooking. Today I run some errands in the city (all ""easily managable"" if you ask prepregnant me - go to bank, to pharmacy, to store and help friend get her ID updated, with loooong coffee to follow) and let me tell you - I am exausted, in pain and can't get a hold of myself. I have cramps in my legs and my lower back is killing me. I slept for two and a half hours when I came home, and still feel like I ran a marathon.

So I glued myselft to my sofa, turned on Yellowstone to unwind while my baby boy is jumping on my ovaries, probably in vengance cause I overextended myself today. My husband, bless his heart, massaged my legs, brought me some christmas cake and water, all before doing all the chores. I can only watch him, not able to stand up and think to myself how stupid and judgmental I was in the past.

To conclude this already long post, in hopes you read it in full and don't judge my naive and stupid mindset too much, I sincerely, from the bottom of my pregnant, emotional heart want to apologies to all the ladies who I considered lazy just cause they couldn't do more. If this is how I feel and I really don't have any big problems (mentally knocking on wood not to jinx it) or restrictions, I applaud and bow to each and every single one of you who is having it harder and deal with a lot of issues and obstacles in their pregnancies. I am so sorry for not understanding and, even though I never said anything to anyone, I was silently judging you while you had more than enough on your plate. All you ladies are heroes and deserve respect for what you are going through.",5,1735322577.0,BabyBumps,2,0.78,False

I typically grind my coffee with my Baratza Encore at the 14 setting. I’ve tried to replicate a similar brew using my new 1zpresso Q2, but the results have been terrible. 

So after adjusting my Q2 for a few days I found that 56 clicks produces a similar grind size to my Encore at 14, but the final brew has a totally different taste. The coffee just seems off. When I grind any finer in the 40-50 clicks range my coffee has a sour taste which is weird because I thought sour coffee is a result from under extraction. Then if I grind any more course my coffee is weak…

The only thing I can think of is that my Encore grinder was producing more fines which resulted in stronger coffee that I got accustomed to? I don’t know what to do. I was really looking forward to using the Q2 in my travel setup.",0,1735322554.0,JamesHoffmann,0,0.5,False

I have 1 or 2 drinks sitting somewhere. It's usually a cup of water and a cup of tea or coffee. My husband dumps my cups whenever he finds them. I've asked him to stop many times. He won't. I put notes on all of my cups telling him not to take my cups. He does it anyway. He believes that I should drink a whole cup at one time and be done with it. He doesn't like the clutter of my cups. I'm nursing and want a drink available all the time. I recently asked him to help more so that I can eat 2 real meals a week at the table. Someone poops their pants mid meal. I clean them up and start a load of laundry. When I come back 15 minutes later, my food is gone and someone else needs me. I live on quick bites and peanut butter crackers I keep in my car.

\- I get to ask a question or two about my coworkers' lives. After all, if I'm going to be spending 8hrs/day, 200 days/yr, for several years with these people, I would like to be friendly and know a little something about them.

The classic symptoms caught up with me - caffeine dependency, sleep issues, constant irritability, and feeling like any additional task could break me. Took 4 weeks off recently and only then realized how burned out I actually was.

Now that I'm starting to feel human again, here's my non-negotiable plan for the final year:

Strict Work Boundaries
- Hard stop at 5pm daily, no exceptions
- Two actual breaks daily, including proper lunch away from desk
- Removed all work apps from phone
- Disabled notifications (ditched the Apple Watch)
- No more coffee - wasn't worth the anxiety/sleep trade-off

Regular Reset Periods
- Monthly 3-day complete tech-free retreats
- Using PTO strategically instead of hoarding it

Future Focus
- Starting to build post-FIRE life 6 months before leaving
- Exploring volunteer/non-profit work aligned with my values
- Treating this as part of my workday, not extra homework

I'm treating these boundaries as seriously as my FIRE number - because what's the point of FI if you're too burned out to enjoy it?

1hnkndi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lexi459/comments/1hnkndi/so_this_is_about_my_brother/,So this is about my brother,"I need to do something about my brother. He's lazy, unmotivated, fat, doesn't like going out and is afraid of talking to people who are not his family members. He's 34. Never had a girlfriend and has no prospects for arranged match either. Let me explain-

1. The laziness: Doesn't do anything to contribute in household chores. Before you say most men don't and have no role models. Our dad does a lot and he's very hands on. He cooks, cleans, exercises, eats healthy but the only thing he has never done is discipled his children. His motto is - ""The children will do whatever they think is best for themselves. What can I do?""
And so if my brother ignores a task or procrastinates, our dad does it  himself. My brother conveniently ignores the whole thing. He doesn't even feel guilty even though our dad's old now. My mom is so tired of him she has zero expectation.
He lives in our parents 3 br house where we grew up while parents have settled in a different city since before covid. He does have a job and not financially dependent on our parents though (I feel this is largely due to him not paying rent).
He does spend money on online subscriptions, electronics, ordering food, cleaning services off of urban company etc. When I tell him to find his own place he says he wouldn't be left with any money. He knows I live on my own, rent my own apartment, pay my own bills, cook, clean my own house all within the budget of my salary which is far less than his and still manage to save. He just says oh that's you nobody can do what you do. And I will be like there are so many men who do the exact same thing as me. It's not a gender thing. Everyone learns how to survive on their own. He argues not the men he knows they have wives and mothers to look after everything. I can't even respond to this. You may be able to guess why he's not been able to get a match even though we don't want dowry and will pay half for wedding.

2. The apathy and anti-social behaviour: He does want to get ahead in life, earn better, lose weight, change jobs, make friends and be more social- but he doesn't do anything about it. He speaks Hindi and English very well by the way but it doesn't really matter if doesn't make any effort totalk to other people. I always try to take him within my own social circles to practice and maybe see how other men are conversing etc. You have to drag him to these things. And I have to hear so much from him before he finally submits into going in a rare moment. He said he wants to socialise but doesn't know how to so I told him to use me as a step ladder, meet my friends and go out with me on events but he shuts me down. I noticed even if we go for coffee or eating out he asks me to order. He said he wants to get married but who wants to marry a recluse like that? It's not even the women- he gets rejected by the families of the girls. This despite having a stable job. We are not looking for only thin girls - as he's obese himself. Even if we find someone for him I wonder if he can sustain it with his temperament.

It's always a constant battle trying to put him in the right direction. It's always -"" oh you are a girl so you can do everything. My brain doesn't function like that""

Yes- it sounds like I am a hellish sister but I can't bear seeing him just waste his mind, body and soul. I am posting here so I get other men's perspective.if me being his sister is the problem- how would a brother help him? Perhaps I can try emulate that. TIA",1,1735322247.0,u_lexi459,0,1.0,False

To start, I do have an appointment with an internist on Jan 7. However, I'm really at a loss and can't find anything online about a cat experiencing ataxia related to pre-syncope or vasovagal reaction for 15+ hours. She has a hx of syncope 5 yrs ago. I apologize for the long post but am including relevant hx and diagnostic findings from her ER visit. 

Cat is 13yo spayed female. In October this yr she had a full geriatric exam including blood & urine and the vet said she was ""healthy as a 5yo"" and ""wouldn't know she was 13"" if I hadn't told him so. 

Dec 24 I came home at 7 at night. I noticed she was being clumsy, fell off the couch, then the coffee table.. she shook her head and fell while walking. Then threw up a small hairball and after that was very wobbly. She started stumbling. I took her to the ER at 10 where they ran all the tests. 

Note of hx: her movements reminded me of 5 yrs ago when she had 3 syncope events over the course of 3 months-ish. One occurred after she was in the litter box, one after throwing up, and one during a urine draw. At the first event she went to ER where they didn't find anything about the syncope but did find severe cystitis. We treated that over the following few months until everything was normal. Neither condition has recurred since then. 

At ER to my knowledge they couldn't recreate her stumbling but said that's not unusual. Shr was neurologically normal.Bloodwork showed mild metabolis acidosis, mild elevated cholesterol, and elevated sodium and chloride, normal pancreatic enzymes. Urine was normal. Ultrasound showed bilobed gall bladder which he said was normal, and mild irritation around the stomach but no issues with bladder etc. Chest xrays normal. Given her hx he feels this is likely vasovagal related, even though she never actually fainted (to my knowledge) and last time, she always was fine before the syncope and then fine 10 minutes after.

He initially said she should have a cardiology consult, or a neuro, or internal medicine, then seemed to decide on cardiology, but THEN said he knew the internist at the same specialty vet as a Cardiologist and thinks he's the smartest vet he's ever met, so to basically go through him first. I have an appointment Jan 7. 

When I got her home she was still extremely uncoordinated. She promptly fell off the table and if she hadn't landed in some boxes she could have hurt herself. The next morning around 10am, she was still stumbling but seemed slightly better. It slowly improved throughout the day. Aside from  maybe being a little lethargic, she seems fine now. 

Now here's my questions. I am not asking for a diagnosis. 

In her previous episodes she did not have ataxia before or for very long after the syncope. I cannot find anything online about prolonged ataxia related to vasovagal issues... is this something that happens? 

Let's say that this type of thing does happen, is there even treatment of any kind for a vasovagal response causing prolonged ataxia? 

If this is a vasovagal reaction, can this type of thing be fatal? 

I don't want to put my senior cat through a million tests just to find out ""oh well she's got this syncope problem, nbd, nothing we can do about it"". The specialist consults are very expensive and not covered by my insurance, so going in educated and able to advocate for her is important to me. 

Anyway if anyone read this far I really appreciate it and really appreciate any insight at all into this.

I (26M) had a major fight with my girlfriend (32F).
I won’t go into the details because they are irrelevant.

We have been in a relationship for around 17 months. I love her deeply, and I believe she still loves me too.
However, I’ve done some terrible things.

After office hours, her clients would call her non-stop, and we had decided to keep her phone on silent because it would ring at all hours, disrupting our time together.
One day, I put her phone in water out of frustration. Luckily, nothing got damaged.

She has a 20-year-old nagging injury on the left side of her body. She’s never attended physiotherapy regularly, and as a result, she has to walk in an unusual manner. After over six months of trying to convince her to go, I became more pushy. Eventually, she went to the hospital, but she took her brother along instead of me.

Once, I took her to Fortis for an appointment. We were running late, and the doctor again recommended physiotherapy. She didn’t follow through with it. I got so upset that I spat in my coffee cup and asked her to drink it.

These incidents had been piling up because I want her to take care of her health. I know a 20-year-old injury might not be completely fixable, and I’ve come to terms with that. But all I expect from her is to at least try. Just two days ago, she admitted she hadn’t done any physiotherapy exercises at home for the last 10 days.

One night, I was drunk and on anxiety/sleep medications. Somehow, the conversation steered toward all these issues—probably because of me. She said I wanted a supermodel as a wife/girlfriend. I don’t.

I was already on edge, and my God, please forgive me—please, let my girlfriend forgive me—I grabbed her by the neck and pushed her aside. When I realized what I’d done, I punched the almirah so hard that I broke my wrist.

I want to change. I need help. I’ve tried therapy with different therapists, but nothing seems to work. She’s amazing—the only issue we ever have is her unwillingness to prioritize her health. She’s so gorgeous, so sweet-spoken. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed. I know I shouldn’t have done these things.

She recently went home for the Christmas holidays and got work-from-home arrangements. While there, she told me she had a breakdown in front of her mom and revealed everything I did. I’m ready to apologize to her entire family, but she isn’t letting me—maybe because it’s too soon?

I’ve put so much stress on her. I try to contribute by paying half the rent of her place since half of my stuff is there anyway. Her salary is ₹35k, and the rent is approximately ₹20k. She’s never asked me to split the rent. Recently, she even gifted me a ₹25k rose gold ring for my birthday.

She is everything to me—everything I’ve ever wanted and things I didn’t even realize I needed.

She told me she’ll talk to me after my Bali trip, after January 13th.
When I asked her about the chances of us getting back together, she said, “5%, maybe.”

What do I do? How can I redeem myself? How can I start fresh with her again? I’m trying to work on my anger, but it gets out of control at times.

Our families know about us. My mom knows everything, and so does hers.

Is there anything I can do? Please, everyone, I need your advice. She is the only reason I haven’t given up on life yet.

I've apologised to her brother he didn't reply but read it. ",1,1735321449.0,AskIndianWomen,12,1.0,False

Have been to Goa a few times and to North and South Goa both.

A common pattern noted across all the places irrespective of North or South (and got a first hand experience) is of the scam, by stopping you and asking you to scratch a card. If you don't win the first time, either you get another one or your partner or your kid get one, but you'll surely get a gift from the scratch card, probably one of - a tablet, cash, 3N/4D holiday or an expensive phone.

Next step is to convince you that what they need is just 1 hour of your time, where they 'll invite you to a well known hotel/resort like Sobit Sarovar Portico in Palolem or Grand Leoney resort in Vagator or something similar depending on where you are, and you'll get welcome drinks, tea/coffee, cookies etc., everything for free and you're only expected to listen to their presentation.

Once you go, they'll confuse you with things like, we'll ask for some details, you'll have to fill some forms, do you use credit/debit cards? which credit/debit cards do you use etc.

And then you're taken inside a room where you'll see the resort/brand names like Radisson, W, Best Western and what not, none of which has anything to do with this but just to impress you and play with your psychology. And then the game begins.

In short, they'll either make you feel guilty or greedy to go for their fraud membership which they call ""ownership"". You'll be asked to sign a legal contract with them and that's it.

You've been scammed!!!

They don't have any 3/4/5 star properties, even the google reviews of those properties are below 4-stars.

There is an annual fees on top of the membership fees and the exchange fees if you want to stay in any other good properties. Not to mention, there is no guarantee that you'll get a booking in the property you want.

You'd have been shown stars and moon during the presentation, but if you really read the contract or properly go through their documents which they show during the presentation to prove that they're an old company and registered with tourism department etc., you'll come to know most of what they're saying in presentation isn't correct.

And now starts the nightmares!!!

P.S. The lucky scratch card will ALWAYS have 3N/4D holidays with terms & conditions with which you'd probably never be bale to utilize it.

**PLEASE RUN AWAY IF YOU HEAR - LOYAL TREE, GO LIFE VACATIONS or something similar.**

She sat motionless on the couch, the silence of her apartment pressing down on her like a suffocating weight. The phone call replayed in her mind, each of Luigi’s words cutting deeper and deeper, until they felt like wounds she couldn’t stitch back together.

Her breath hitched, and she curled forward, pressing her hands to her face. She couldn’t keep this up. She’d spent her entire career building walls—walls to protect her reputation, her integrity, and her carefully constructed life. And now, with just a few sentences, Luigi Mangione had unraveled her.

It wasn’t just about him. It wasn’t just about the way he looked at her, the way he kissed her, or the way his voice slipped under her skin like a melody she couldn’t forget. It was about her. The person she’d worked so hard to be.

She thought of her colleagues, the people who respected her for her professionalism and sharp mind. What would they think if they knew? What would they say if they saw the cracks forming in the impenetrable armor she’d spent years perfecting?

Her chest tightened, and a sob broke free, shaking her entire body. She hated herself for it—for the tears, for the vulnerability, for the fact that she was even in this situation in the first place. She had always been in control. Always. But Luigi had taken that from her, and she didn’t know how to get it back.

“It’s not fair,” she whispered into the quiet, her voice trembling. “This isn’t fair.”

Tears streamed down her cheeks, hot and relentless. She thought of the kiss, the way his hands had felt on her skin, the way he’d looked at her like she was the only person in the world. She hated that part of her wanted it again, wanted him again, despite everything. Despite the risks. Despite the consequences.

“This isn’t who I am,” she whispered, clutching the edge of the couch as if it could steady her. But even as she said the words, a small, insidious voice in the back of her mind asked: Are you sure?

She tried to convince herself it was just lust, just a fleeting attraction to a client who knew how to manipulate people. But deep down, she knew it was more than that. It wasn’t just about physical desire. It was about the way he saw her, the way he cut through the layers of composure she showed the world and found something raw, something real.

And that terrified her more than anything else.

She sobbed harder, her tears soaking into the sleeves of her blouse as she buried her face in her hands. She had worked so hard, given so much of herself to her career, and now it felt like it was all slipping away. If anyone found out, it would destroy her reputation. Her colleagues would never look at her the same way again. And worse—she wasn’t sure she’d look at herself the same way either.

She stayed like that for what felt like hours, her body wracked with sobs that refused to stop. When the tears finally slowed, she felt drained, hollow, and unsure of what to do next.

Her phone buzzed on the coffee table, and she stared at it for a long moment, dreading what she might see. When she finally picked it up, her breath caught in her throat.

It was a message from Luigi.

“I meant every word.”

Her heart clenched, and she set the phone down quickly, as if it were burning her skin. She couldn’t do this. She couldn’t let him pull her into his orbit any further. But even as she told herself that, a small, treacherous part of her wondered if she’d already fallen too far.

She was so clearly and undeniably falling for him. 


The room was silent except for the soft ticking of the clock on the wall. Alexandra sat at the long oak conference table, files spread in front of her, yet untouched. Her fingers trembled as she reached for her glass of water, but she couldn’t bring herself to take a sip. Her mind was elsewhere, tangled in the chaos of everything she’d been holding back.

This wasn’t just another court proceeding. This was the biggest trial of Luigi’s case so far—the day she had spent months preparing for, the day everything hinged on. But her emotions were raw, exposed, and impossible to ignore.

The private consultation she had arranged was meant to finalize their strategy, to ensure there were no loose ends before they faced the prosecution tomorrow morning. She had told herself this meeting was about control, about maintaining the professionalism she prided herself on.

But deep down, she knew why she had called him here.

The door opened, and Luigi entered, escorted by a guard who left them alone without a word. His eyes locked onto hers immediately, and the intensity in his gaze made her heart skip a beat. He wore a calm expression, but there was something in the way he carried himself—something sharper, hungrier—that set her nerves on edge.

“Alexandra,” his voice grumbled lowly, his voice smooth and velvety. “What’s so urgent that it couldn’t wait until tomorrow?”

She didn’t respond at first, her hands clutching the edge of the table as she tried to steady herself. But when she finally looked up at him, the vulnerability in her eyes made him pause.

He stepped closer, his movements slow and deliberate. “What’s wrong?” he asked, his voice softening.

Her breath hitched, and she shook her head, trying to push the words out. “I… I can’t do this anymore.”

Luigi frowned, his dark eyes narrowing. “What do you mean?”

“This,” she said, gesturing vaguely between them. “You, this case, everything. It’s too much. You’re breaking me, Luigi.”

He tilted his head, studying her carefully. “I didn’t mean to break you, Alex. But you… you’ve unraveled me too.”

The weight of his words, combined with the intensity of his gaze, was too much. Alexandra stood abruptly, turning away from him as her emotions threatened to spill over. She couldn’t look at him, couldn’t let him see how vulnerable she truly was.

But Luigi wasn’t the type to let her hide.

He crossed the room in two steps, his hands gently but firmly gripping her shoulders as he turned her to face him. “Alexandra,” he said softly, his voice filled with an emotion she couldn’t place. “Talk to me.”

She tried to hold it together, but the dam broke. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she finally let herself feel everything she had been suppressing—her fear, her anger, her longing.

“I’ve worked so hard for this,” she said, her voice trembling. “My career, my reputation—it’s all I have. And now… I don’t even know who I am anymore.”

Luigi’s expression shifted, the smugness and confidence replaced by something raw, something real. He cupped her face gently, his thumbs brushing away her tears. “You’re the strongest person I’ve ever met,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “And you’re so much more than your career, Alex. You’re… everything.”

She shook her head, her hands clutching his shirt as if it were the only thing keeping her grounded. “You don’t understand,” she said, her voice breaking. “If anyone finds out about this, about us… it’ll destroy me.”

Luigi leaned closer, his forehead resting against hers. “Then no one will find out,” he murmured. “I won’t let anyone hurt you. I won’t let this hurt you.”

For a moment, they stood like that, the world outside the room fading away. Alexandra's  walls had crumbled completely, and she felt exposed, vulnerable—but also safe.

And then, before she could second-guess herself, she closed the distance between them.

Alexandra's  heart pounded in her chest, each beat echoing loudly in her ears as Luigi pulled her closer. She could feel the heat radiating off his body, a stark contrast to the cool air conditioning that usually kept the room at an impersonal temperature. His hand on her back was firm, unyielding, and she felt herself being drawn into him like a moth to a flame.

Her lips met his, desperate and unrestrained, and Luigi responded immediately, his hands sliding down to her waist, pulling her closer. The kiss was a storm, chaotic and consuming, fueled by months of tension and longing. 

What I want? Her mind screamed, frantic, desperate to hold onto the shreds of control she had left. But her body betrayed her again, leaning into his touch despite every logical cell in her brain telling her to pull away. His fingers traced a slow, deliberate path up her spine, sending shivers cascading down her arms.

""Let me go,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the cacophony of her thoughts. “This isn’t who I am.”
Luigi chuckled softly, the sound rumbling through his chest and vibrating against her. “Isn’t it?” he countered, his tone laced with amusement. “Because from where I’m standing, you’re exactly who you’ve been pretending not to be.”

She didn’t care about the consequences, not in that moment. All she cared about was the way he made her feel—alive, seen, desired.

Before she could respond, his lips crashed down on hers, silencing any protest she might have mustered. The kiss was intense, almost violent, as if he were trying to claim her right then and there. Her eyes fluttered shut, her senses overwhelmed by the sheer force of him. His tongue darted into her mouth, exploring, demanding entrance, and she found herself melting into the sensation, her resistance crumbling like sand beneath a tide.

One of his hands slid up to cup her face, his thumb brushing gently across her cheekbone. “Open your eyes,” he commanded, his voice thick with desire. Reluctantly, she did as he said, meeting his dark, penetrating gaze. There was something intoxicating about his confidence, his certainty that he could bend her to his will. And she hated herself for how much she craved it.

When they finally pulled apart, their breathing heavy, Luigi rested his forehead against hers, his hands still holding her as if he were afraid to let go.

“This changes everything,” She whispered, her voice shaky.

Luigi smiled faintly, his thumb brushing against her cheek. “It changes nothing. You’re still Alexandra Harper—the strongest, most brilliant woman I’ve ever known. And I’m still the man who will do anything to keep you.”

Her heart ached at his words, torn between the fear of what this meant and the undeniable pull she felt toward him. She didn’t know what the future held, but in that moment, she couldn’t bring herself to care.

Without warning, Luigi spun her around, pressing her back against the nearest wall. She let out a small gasp as her shoulder blades hit the cold surface, only for the sound to be swallowed by his lips as they reclaimed hers. His body pinned her in place, his hips grinding against hers in a way that left no doubt as to his intentions.

For the first time in a long time, she let herself just feel.

My old mum has always sweared by these and -  while not a replacement for steroids of course - they can be really soothing on your throat if your steroids aren't helping or you're in between prescriptions. 

  
Ginger tea

Chop up a big chunk of fresh ginger into tiny pieces and mash with a pestle and mortar. Steep in a teapot with a tea bag (or two) and in boiling water for a few minutes. Then make tea and add milk, sugar etc. It makes a really nice tea with a real kick to the throat which is very warming and soothing. 

  
Ginger slices

Chop up tiny slivers of fresh ginger and suck on them like you would like normal lozenges. My asthma has been bad lately and I did this last night and I had the best sleep I've had in a while. It's a similar effect to the ginger tea but a bit more intense - my throat wheezes and tickles were soothed and I felt the wheezes stop for a while, which gave some relief.

Of course you'll have to get used to the taste but I don't think it's too bad personally, as I like the taste of ginger!  

  
In fact, can we get a megathread (mods?) of home remedies that might help folks that are in between medications or think their meds aren't helping enough?

Other things I find that helps me:

[**Kaitlin Bellamy – Windswept**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42181089-windswept)


The *cozy fantasy* of twee bakeries, anachronistic coffee shops, and slice-of-life narratives fails to move me whatsoever, so instead I came up with my own definition of this subgenre. What makes me feel cozy are those classic weatherworn coming-of-age tales about unlikely youths from the corner of the map who discover Hidden Talents™ within themselves and run off on an adventure. *Windswept* is one of such books, and one of its the most unusual qualities is that both of the protagonist's parents are very much alive and play an important part in the story (they've got nothing on his best friend's immediate family, though). And when it comes to the Hidden Talent™, Fox's skill is refreshingly tame – being able to talk to the wind and interact with maps in unusual ways, which drives the central plot forward and gets our hero into trouble as well as out of it. While it's true that we don't get a multi-chapter training montage of our hero learning überdestructive magicks, the story has its share of tense and outright tragic moments, which are woven into the narrative quite well. The book ends with plenty of promise, and I'm keen to dive into the sequels some time soon.


[**Patricia McKillip – Song for the Basilisk**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81070.Song_for_the_Basilisk)


A book so musical you can put it on a lectern before an orchestra: its pages are home to bards, operas, composers, musical academies, and magical instruments. McKillip uses her unsurpassed sense of style and lyrical prose to add a poetic dimension to a fairy run-of-the-mill plot about the lost scion of a purged family and his belated revenge on the despotic autocrat who ordered the killing. There is nothing trivial about its presentation as well: the protagonist is not a fiery-eyed youth but a jaded, melancholic middle-aged bard, and one of the other most prominent POVs is a magister of music who is tasked with writing an opera for the tyrannical Basilisk's birthday. The most interesting character, however, may well be the mysterious, dangerous, and cold-hearted Luna – the tyrant's daughter whom he has tried to shape in his image. In this novel, magic is something intangible and ephemeral found in journeys, songs, mirrors, and forgotten legends – and this soft, lyrical approach to the fantastic suits the story perfectly. Having finished *Song*, I found myself thinking I'd quite enjoy hearing a musical adaptation of this book some day.


[**Josiah Bancroft – The Hexologists**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59612836-the-hexologists)


After the conclusion of the *Books of Babel*, which I found rather unsatisfying, I picked up Bancroft's next book with mild trepidation, but *The Hexologists* definitely saw the author return to stellar form. This delicious mystery novel about the eccentric husband-and-wife duo is a lot cozier compared to the darker, tragic tone of *Babel*, but it is nevertheless chock-full of interesting conflicts and inventive worldbuilding, and the characters, albeit deliberately written with a touch of bookish weirdness, time and time again show their relatable human qualities. The established relationship of the protagonists is a breath of fresh air compared to the usual romantic plots where the two heroes are forced to check off every item on the tiresome *New Romantic Entanglement* agenda, and, while stable, their family life is far from boring. Considering the critical success of RJ Bennett's *The Tainted Cup* published this year (not covered here due to its prominence on the subreddit), I'm beginning to think that detective novels might well become the next big fantasy trend.


[**Frances Hardinge – The Cuckoo Song**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18298890-cuckoo-song)


Yet another stop on the picturesque serpentine railroad that is Frances Hardinge's bibliography, and let me tell you, this wondrous train seems to have no brakes whatsoever. This novel is an intriguing and unusual take on the trope of fairy changelings, but it also touches on mental health, helicopter parenting, good people doing bad things for misguided reasons, and the complexity of sisterly relationships where love and hate are separated by just about one nanometre at best. This story is told in Hardinge's trademark fanficul language full of unusual metaphors and imagery, and it's impossible for something as trivial as the real life to distract you from Triss' long and arduous misadventures on her way to discovering her true self. I am going to rue the day when I run out of Hardinge's books to read, although I can easily see myself immediately starting back from the top again.


[**KJ Parker – The Saevus Corax Trilogy**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61030541-saevus-corax-deals-with-the-dead)


You can easily recognise KJ Parker's first-person narrators after just about a page and a half: the dead giveaways are the sardonic prose laced with philosophical musings, a general sense of charming unreliability, and the fact that the universe is getting ready to throw them a nasty curveball. The amount of nasty curveballs that Saevus Corax has to face over the course of this short trilogy probably deserves a *baseball fantasy* label. In the first book, this honest marauder (sorry, contracted battlefield scavenger) is trapped between two influential cut-throat organisations, each of which wants to make him a puppet ruler of the backwater kingdom with key strategic significance. Corax's misadventures are a hilarious thing to spectate because he is a very clever bloke who is mostly opposed by equally clever folks, and most writers can only wish they could write a clever bloke as well as KJ Parker. I'd argue the second book is the strongest in the whole series, dedicated as it is to Corax's slightly quixotic quest chasing a tantalising rumour of a personal nature, and the third one provides a satisfying albeit slightly meandering conclusion to his overly exciting life story. As far as low-fantasy adventure novels starring smart-arse protagonists go, you cannot possibly do better than *The Saevus Corax Trilogy*.


[**Lev Grossman – The Bright Sword**](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32307211)


A highly anticipated tale of post-Arthurian Britain from the author of one of my favourite series ever. *Arthur est mort*, and the *belle époque* of Camelot is rapidly turning to dust. A bunch of third-rate lesser-known knights are all that remains of the Round Table, and it is they (together with the naïve protagonist Collum who has only just made his way to the legendary castle) who must save Britain from that pesky grasper Morgan Le Fay. Grossman remains true to himself and eagerly deconstructs the familiar mythological framework, replacing high diction with deliberate anachronisms. However, instead of turning it all into postmodern ruins and washing his hands of the whole thing, he builds something fresh and personal on Camelot's grimy foundations. Admittedly, the central narrative resembles not a mighty donjon but rather a thin string that hosts the many diverse beads of the knights' personal stories, which makes it easy to lose track of the main plot from time to time. Apart from that, *The Bright Sword* is a very clever, engrossing book that has something for everyone – including a surprisingly pleasant romantic side plot.


[**Raymond St. Elmo – Barnaby the Wanderer**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192507520-barnaby-the-wanderer)


At the end of the list, I come back to my definition of cozy fantasy and present yet another gem in the same vein as above. This daunting doorstopper proved to be an organic mixture of the new and the old; of quirky imagery and seemingly familiar tropes presented from new angles; of engaging prose and a very basic initial plot hook that eventually evolved into a multi-faceted and ever-surprising narrative. Barnaby is a simple-hearted (but definitely not simple) protagonist, and the companions he meets and befriends along his unlikely journey to the distant magic tower make up one of the most pleasant found families I've encountered in fiction lately. It's a classic quest fantasy made unputdownable by narrative twists, intriguing worldbuilding, and very relatable characters who populate these pages. Until now, I only knew Raymond St. Elmo for his occasional playful comments on this subreddit, and I'm happy to report his actual writing does not disappoint at all.

Setting it up is pretty simple. If you're using an iPhone, just open Settings, scroll down to Phone, and tap WiFi Calling. Flip that switch to green and you're good to go. Android users, you'll want to open your Phone app, tap the three dots in the top right, head into Settings, and turn WiFi Calling on.

If you want to get the best experience: make sure you're connected to a strong WiFi network. While that coffee shop WiFi might work in a pinch, your home or office network will typically give you the most reliable connection.

Have been to Goa a few times and to North and South Goa both.

A common pattern noted across all the places irrespective of North or South (and got a first hand experience) is of the scam, by stopping you and asking you to scratch a card. If you don't win the first time, either you get another one or your partner or your kid get one, but you'll surely get a gift from the scratch card, probably one of - a tablet, cash, 3N/4D holiday or an expensive phone.

Next step is to convince you that what they need is just 1 hour of your time, where they 'll invite you to a well known hotel/resort like Sobit Sarovar Portico in Palolem or Grand Leoney resort in Vagator or something similar depending on where you are, and you'll get welcome drinks, tea/coffee, cookies etc., everything for free and you're only expected to listen to their presentation.

Once you go, they'll confuse you with things like, we'll ask for some details, you'll have to fill some forms, do you use credit/debit cards? which credit/debit cards do you use etc.

And then you're taken inside a room where you'll see the resort/brand names like Radisson, W, Best Western and what not, none of which has anything to do with this but just to impress you and play with your psychology. And then the game begins.

In short, they'll either make you feel guilty or greedy to go for their fraud membership which they call ""ownership"". You'll be asked to sign a legal contract with them and that's it.

You've been scammed!!!

They don't have any 3/4/5 star properties, even the google reviews of those properties are below 4-stars.

There is an annual fees on top of the membership fees and the exchange fees if you want to stay in any other good properties. Not to mention, there is no guarantee that you'll get a booking in the property you want.

You'd have been shown stars and moon during the presentation, but if you really read the contract or properly go through their documents which they show during the presentation to prove that they're an old company and registered with tourism department etc., you'll come to know most of what they're saying in presentation isn't correct.

And now starts the nightmares!!!

P.S. The lucky scratch card will ALWAYS have 3N/4D holidays with terms & conditions with which you'd probably never be bale to utilize it.

**PLEASE RUN AWAY IF YOU HEAR - LOYAL TREE, GO LIFE VACATIONS or something similar.**

Sharing few fraudsters names also, just in case - Anand Shetty, Nikhil Dhongade, Miti Shah, Rajesh Chavhan.

So, I’m on the sports day committee and last week I was just helping two girls—M and K—plan their practice schedules. These two are total rivals, always trying to one-up each other, but I didn’t think much of it.

Suddenly, M starts being extra nice—cracking jokes and bringing me coffee during practice. K, on the other hand, starts showing up early, asking me for advice on the smallest things. Now, everyone’s starting to notice, and my friends won’t stop teasing me, saying, “Oho, kya scene chal raha hai?”

Yesterday, M legit brought me coffee, and K shot her this killer look. At this point, the whole school’s acting like I’m stuck in some high school drama, and I’m honestly just trying to help out.

I have no idea how I became the center of this, but now I’m getting texts from my friends asking if I’m in some hidden love triangle. Do I just stay out of it or continue helping them both? I’m starting to feel like a character in a show I didn’t even sign up for.

She's totally different now...,"I shared the long story on my other posts. My fiance got cold and distant and then she dumped me. It was a LDR that was supposed to last until next summer. She argumented that a LDR relationship is not working, she doesn't want a relationship anymore, she got used to being alone over there and she has school+part time job and she doesn't feel like she has time and energy for a relationship. She dismissed most of our good times together, she even dismissed the proposal. 


3 weeks passed, she came home for christmas. She texted me she is back in town and she brought the ""object"" to give back to me. She didn't call it a ring. I asked why, and she said it's just an object for her. We met and went to a restaurant, and talked about us. It was a civilized talk, but this time she had this idea that our relationship was on the wrong path as a LDR and it would have ended bad, and she wants to remain in good terms with me, not as friends, but to keep the door open for a relationship when she moves back. 

On Christmas Eve she sent my mom a text wishing her and my dad marry Christmas, and apologizing she didn't come. She wrote that she really hopes she didn't create an ungly image and it's just a period where she needs time for herself.

Second day, she texted me saying she is driving around and if I want to join her. I said yes. It was short. She had that sexy look, and she made me a little bit horny. There was this sexual tension in the car. She dropped me back home and later texted me: ""I hate you, we shouldn't see each other anymore"". I asked why. She replied: ""you were such a confident sexy guy today, and you're like that again now after we broke up"". The truth is I was always like that but she was so deactivated she kept rejecting me.


Yesterday it happened for her to be around my coffee store. I was there, so we drank a coffee. We had a nice talk, I joined her to her car, and when she got to the car her eyes were filled with tears. I asked what happened. She started crying and said she misses me a lot.


Later she texted me we should go together to a psychologist other than mine or hers. She said maybe it will be helpful, because it was the best realtionship in her life but it seems to break down at communication. I agreed .

first it was getting a diagnosis/prescription. (somehow the easiest part of all this for me...)

then it was fighting with my provider to actually give me my prescription; to stop cancelling my appointments day-of and then saying, ""oh we can't fill it because we haven't seen you in a few months."" girl that ain't my fault! 

so I get a new doctor, and things are better. 

oops! new job, new insurance, time to find a new psychiatrist. 

but wait, now the entire country has a stimulant shortage! good luck! enjoy being forced off your meds and forced to swap medications on a dime because you'll take whatever you can get, you pathetic mentally ill cog!

oops! even though everything has been the same for two years, your doctor doesn't take your insurance anymore. surprise $600 visit bill!! 

surprise!! you've been laid off!!! luckily your now-out-of-network doc is willing to give you three months worth of your meds. insurance won't pay for that though so that's a bonus $200 you get to spend. hope you didn't need that unemployment check this month :)

hooray! you've found a job and got insurance. and your doctor will give you a month of adderall to get you by while you set up your psych!! 

SIKE BITCH YOU THOUGHT. YOU DUMBASS THOUGHT IT WAS ALL SORTED! nope, now you have to choose between using thc to help your brain shut the fuck up at night, and being medicated at all. 

so now I'm being forced to ""quit"" weed, which has truly been a godsend to me. I'm being treated like an addict on both ends— for wanting my stimulant meds, and for using weed. I'm a fucking adult and it's legal. 

~~suck my goddamn dick bro you don't even know me y'all getting real fucking bold as an insurance company when we ALL saw what happened last month AND IM FREAKIN UNSTABLE (for legal purposes this is a **joke** i am **not** a green italian plumber and I have no plans on joining that union at the present moment I repeat for legal reasons I am **joking**)~~

anyway lmao

it's just so frustrating. I've found what works for me, and because of this stupid insurance that's tied to my job, I have to listen to this massive corporation tell me that I have a ""problem"" and now I'm questioning whether or not I am addicted. it doesn't feel fair. I already quit nicotine of my own volition and honest to god I'm about to pick it back up out of straight up rage. I'd be just as pissed if they told me I had to stop drinking coffee or wine or whatever. it's so fucked up that something that has helped me so immensely is treated as criminal and it's LITERALLY LEGAL. 

stopping the Adderall frankly isn't an option. on days I don't take my meds, I get stuck and I'm an emotionally disregulated disaster. I've been forced off my anxiety meds already and it's too difficult to get back on them. just let me keep my Adderall and my weed, bro. I feel like I'm not asking for much.

1hnjl94,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1hnjl94/chapter_3_show_me_your_war_face/,"Chapter 3 ""Show Me Your War Face""","“War’s a racket,” I told him, flipping the textbook closed and leaning back in my chair. The coffee in front of me had gone cold. We’d been sitting there for hours, and I still didn’t have an answer that made sense. “That’s what Smedley Butler said, right? And here I am, about to sign up for it.”

Ryan snorted, stirring his latte without looking at me. “It’s not like you’ve got a ton of choices. What’s the alternative? Stay here and drown in student loans? Watch your dad...?” He trailed off, catching himself.

“Yeah, I get it.” I cut him off before he could say the words. It wasn’t like I didn’t know. The hospital visits were already a blur of fluorescent lights and clipped conversations. Insurance paperwork piling up on the dining table. The doctors trying to say nothing while saying everything. It was like watching someone drown in slow motion, and you’re the one handing them the weights.

I stared out the café window, the reflection of the streetlights pooling on the glass. “Enlist, get the benefits, take care of my dad. It’s the logical choice, right? Do everything right, and the system will reward you. Isn’t that what they say?”

Ryan finally looked at me, his face unreadable. “Is that what you say?”

I didn’t answer. I didn’t know how to.

The recruitment office wasn’t far from here. I’d walked past it a hundred times, the posters in the windows promising adventure and purpose. The kind of purpose that comes with health insurance, tuition assistance, and a steady paycheck.

“You’ll hate it,” Ryan said, breaking the silence. “You’re not cut out for it. All the yelling and orders and... conforming.”

“Maybe I need that,” I said quietly. “Structure. Discipline. A way out.”

“A way out of what?” he asked, leaning forward. “You’ve got good grades, a brain that actually works, and the kind of charm that makes people listen to you. You’re gonna trade all that in for a uniform and a rifle? For what, a ‘thank you for your service’ bumper sticker?”

I laughed, but it was hollow. “It’s not about me, man. You know that. It’s about him.”

Ryan didn’t argue. He just nodded, and that silence was worse than any lecture he could’ve given me.

Later that night, lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and tried to convince myself I wasn’t already decided. But I was.

Boot camp would come and go, just like they promised. The benefits would kick in. My dad would get the care he needed. I’d figure out the rest later.

The system wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t broken. Not completely. You just had to work harder, push through the cracks, and eventually, it would hold. That’s what I told myself as I scrawled my name on the enlistment papers the next morning.

But even then, a voice in the back of my head whispered something else. Something darker.

You just signed up for a war that isn’t yours.

The Army gave me discipline and purpose. It gave me hope. Hope that maybe, if I worked hard enough, followed the rules, and played the game right, I could make things better—for my dad, for myself, for this world that seemed so broken but still fixable.

Boot camp was a machine, relentless and unyielding. They didn’t just break you—they dismantled you, piece by piece, sanding away everything that made you you until only the essentials were left. Then, they rebuilt you. Stronger, faster, more obedient. I liked it. The clarity of it. Do X, get Y. Run this fast, lift that much, shoot this target, and the world makes sense. It wasn’t so different from a Dark Souls game—only, if you screwed up, there was no respawning.

I thrived in it. Already in decent shape when I enlisted, I quickly became stronger, tougher, more resilient. By the time we hit the shooting range, I was ranked one of the best marksmen in my class. They gave me a Sharpshooter badge to prove it.

It wasn’t easy, though. Being an introvert in a place like that? It made me a target. Guys like Murphy and Big Mike took one look at me—quiet, focused, not part of the banter—and saw someone they could mess with. They pushed, joked, and tested me, waiting for a reaction.

I didn’t give them one. That was the rule, right? Keep your head down, follow orders, and things will work out.

But then came that trust-building exercise. One of those exercises designed to force you to share something personal. It was the first time I told them about my dad. About how we’d fought the system—doctors, insurers, endless paperwork—all to get him the treatment he needed, only to lose over and over again. I told them why I was there: not to serve some abstract idea of ""freedom"" but because this was my only way out. The only way to take care of him.

That changed things.

From that day on, the jokes were still there, but they had an edge of respect. Rodriguez, always the joker, said, “Doc’s fighting his own war, man.” Murphy and Big Mike—two guys I swore I’d never like—started watching my back instead of aiming jabs at it. They called me ""Doc"" after that, short for ""Doctor’s Bill."" Stupid, but it stuck.

By the time we finished Ranger School, we weren’t just soldiers. We were brothers. I wasn’t just the introverted outcast anymore. I was one of them.

The night we graduated, we celebrated hard. Drinks flowed freely, joints got passed around, and the tension of months of relentless training dissolved into something that felt like freedom. Rodriguez played bartender, Murphy told raunchy jokes, and Big Mike reenacted one of our instructors’ infamous rants using a broomstick as a prop.

For a while, it was perfect.

Then, it wasn’t.

The shift was subtle. The laughter turned darker, the teasing sharper. Words slurred by alcohol and haze turned into something else entirely. I don’t remember all of it. Just fragments. Hands where they shouldn’t have been. Voices, low and insistent. The camaraderie twisting into something I couldn’t recognize.

I fought. I don’t know how, but I fought harder than I thought I could. Maybe they sobered up enough to realize what they were doing, or maybe someone else stepped in—I don’t remember. All I know is that it stopped before it went too far.

But “too far” is a relative term, isn’t it?

The next day, the air was heavy. No one mentioned what happened. No apologies, no excuses. Just silence.

The hardest part wasn’t forgiving them. That came almost immediately. People make mistakes. Alcohol, drugs, adrenaline—it’s a volatile mix. They weren’t monsters. They were just human.

The hardest part was forgiving myself.

Because deep down, in a place I didn’t want to acknowledge, there had been a moment—a fraction of a second—where I didn’t want to fight. A moment where I thought, Maybe if I just let it happen, it’ll be easier. Maybe it won’t even be that bad.

I hated myself for that. For the weakness, the passivity, the betrayal of everything I thought I stood for.

I didn’t report it. What would’ve been the point? The Army isn’t built to handle nuance. Either you’re strong or you’re weak. And weakness gets stamped out.

I tried to push through. To be stronger, tougher, more resilient. But something had shifted inside me. The sharp focus that had carried me through training was gone, replaced by a fog I couldn’t shake. I started having nightmares—vivid, suffocating things that left me drenched in sweat and gasping for air.

It wasn’t long before they noticed.

The official diagnosis was PTSD. They said I wasn’t fit for duty, handed me a discharge, and sent me back into the world I thought I’d escaped.

The hardest part of all of it? It wasn’t the betrayal, or the nightmares, or the discharge. It was admitting to myself that I’d forgiven them, but I hadn’t forgiven me.

Eventually, I did. It took months, but I forgave myself for that fleeting moment of weakness, that split-second where I considered surrender. Forgiveness didn’t come easy. It felt like clawing my way out of a pit, inch by inch, but it came.

But forgetting? That’s a different story.

I feel so badly saying this but I really do not like the newborn phase.  It was such a struggle with my first and I was hoping my second wouldn’t have all the issues my first had.  Yet, here we are.  It doesn’t help that both of my babes have had terrible gas and reflux as newborns, making them fussy and uncomfortable and difficult to get to sleep, then they become overtired which is a whole other issue.  My newborn is 5 weeks old today and we just got reflux meds earlier this week.  Still, she’s plagued with gas after feeds despite frequent burping and pace feeding (when bottle fed).  I do 80% breast milk and supplement with Enfamil Sensitive.  She has two oral ties (posterior tongue and very much an upper lip tie) that I want to get checked out in January once we are on my husband’s insurance.

I know this will improve with time but my god does it suck while in it.  Because of her tummy issues I also can’t put her down during her awake time because she starts crying almost immediately.  With my toddler I need to be able to put sister down for a short time so I can prepare a meal or eat my breakfast or make a cup of coffee. 

I know this will all be worth it in the end.  Trying to get through this phase and need encouragement. What are your best carriers and tips for babies with reflux and gas?  I own a solly baby but it’s not my favorite in terms of support. ",1,1735319403.0,babywearing,2,1.0,False

# #NATURAL WRITING FOR YOUR NEWSLETTER💌:

**Instructions:** 

`Use this structured approach to craft content that’s not only natural and clear but also engaging, relevant, and action-oriented.**`

**1️⃣ Start with the Reader’s Perspective**

`**Write content that instantly addresses the reader’s needs or curiosity.**`

	• Ask: What does my audience want to know or achieve?
	• Example 1: “Struggling to get more readers? Here’s the fix.”
	• Example 2: “Need faster writing tips? Let’s make it happen.”

**2️⃣ Anchor Writing in Real-World Examples**

`**Make your points relatable and actionable with specific examples.**`

	• Example 1: Instead of “Clarity improves writing,” use: “Imagine reading a blog where every sentence feels like a puzzle. You’d stop reading, right?”

	• Example 2: Replace “Engage your audience” with: “Try starting your article with a question like, ‘Do you feel stuck when writing?”

**3️⃣ Combine Simplicity with Depth**

`Keep sentences clear but ensure each one delivers meaningful insights.`

	• Example 1: Instead of “This tool is useful,” say: “This tool saves you 30 minutes per draft by refining your tone and grammar instantly.”

	• Example 2: Instead of “Write naturally,” say: “Write as if explaining to a friend over coffee—casual, clear, and focused.”

**4️⃣ Encourage Micro-Stories**

`**Incorporate brief, relatable anecdotes to capture attention.**`

	`**•**	**Example 1: “When I started writing, I spent hours editing every sentence. Then I learned to focus on clarity first—game changer!”**`

	`**•**	**Example 2: “A client once told me their blog wasn’t converting. We rewrote the intro to address the reader’s problem. Conversions tripled.”`

**5️⃣ Integrate a Feedback Loop**

`Add self-check questions to ensure the content aligns with the goal.`

	•Ask This:
	• Does this sentence make sense instantly?
	• Is this something I’d say out loud?
	• Can I cut any fluff without losing meaning?

**6️⃣ Enhance Engagement with Subtle Techniques**

`**Use rhetorical questions, analogies, or vivid imagery to keep readers hooked.**`

	• Example 1: “What if you could write an entire blog post in half the time?”
	• Example 2: “Think of writing as cooking: the fewer unnecessary ingredients, the better the dish.”

**7️⃣ Optimize for Clarity and Skimmability**

`Break up long paragraphs and use bullet points or headings for readability.`

	• Example 1: “Here’s how to simplify your content:
	❶ • Use short paragraphs.
	❷ • Write clear headlines.
	❸ • Get to the point fast.”

	• Example 2: “In just three steps, you can:
	❶. Edit faster.
	❷. Write clearer.
	❸. Engage better.”

### 8️⃣ Example of Using the Content Insertion:

`**Input Example of how I write (Your Newsletter or Blog post)**`


**Final Prompt**

`**“Write content tailored to the reader’s needs, using real-world examples and micro-stories to add relatability. Simplify your language but deliver depth in every sentence. Use engagement techniques like rhetorical questions, analogies, and vivid imagery. Ensure clarity by breaking content into digestible sections. Include a feedback loop to check for relevance, readability, and impact. Make your writing feel like a conversation—human, clear, and actionable.”**`

You were talking about bullying but yet when asked about how you treat people just doing their job, you block. Remember all those people, Tjmaxx worker, the cop, and that coffee shop.  You didn't have any problem bullying them all over your platforms.  You know you are a terrible person and even worse mom that you need to bring God in your BS. 

Also the fact that L is in your live trading all the comments is disgusting and irresponsible as a parent but we all know you hate being a mom. I pray that L doesn't feel like she is loved less because she isn't with you 24/7 like the other two.  That she can't live with you because her father wants better for her than you do.  I hope she realizes sooner than later that she is better off with him.  I just wish the other two had better.  

So you keep blocking people who call you out and tell the truth.  Your God will deal with you when it's time.  Have the life you deserve.  I'll still watch from my other accounts.  Lol",8,1735319266.0,adriellesiglersnarkk,2,1.0,False

It was such a struggle with my first and I was hoping my second wouldn’t have all the issues my first had.  Yet, here we are.  It doesn’t help that both of my babes have had terrible gas and reflux as newborns, making them fussy and uncomfortable and difficult to get to sleep, then they become overtired which is a whole other issue.  My newborn is 5 weeks old today and we just got reflux meds earlier this week.  Still, she’s plagued with gas after feeds despite frequent burping and pace feeding (when bottle fed).  I do 80% breast milk and supplement with Enfamil Sensitive.  With my first we did a bottle of formula before bed and it helped her sleep a nice long stretch but we aren’t getting as lucky with #2.  Last night she was awake from 9:20-12:30 cluster feeding even with the formula bottle.  We can’t get a bedtime going yet because I’m sucking at getting her in a routine where a bedtime falls at about the same time each night.  I figured we may be slower to get there until this reflux and gas improves.  We are still in survival mode. 

I know this will improve with time but my god does it suck while in it.  Because of her tummy issues I also can’t put her down during her awake time because she starts crying almost immediately.  With my toddler I need to be able to put sister down for a short time so I can prepare a meal or eat my breakfast or make a cup of coffee. 

I know this will all be worth it in the end.  Trying to get through this phase and need encouragement. ",8,1735319000.0,beyondthebump,7,1.0,False

I’ve been working a 9 to 5 job for the past two years, and being from a middle-class Nepali family, I’m constantly thinking about how to manage my money. On one hand, I know I should save for the future, but I also want to enjoy the present. I hear that investing early is important, but I’m not sure where to start—stocks, real estate, or something else? It all seems overwhelming.

Society tells me I should buy a car or property to show success. But is that really the right choice, or should I be saving more? I also want to have fun—travel, eat out, and buy things I like—but I wonder how much is too much bcoz I used to think to spend for a coffee in big restaurant also lol

Retirement feels far away, but I know I should start planning. So, should I focus on saving and investing for the long-term or enjoy life more now? The conflicting advice and pressure are leaving me uncertain about the right path forward.

1hnjbmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1hnjbmd/the_ultimate_meal_planning_and_grocery_list/,The Ultimate Meal Planning and Grocery List Prompt for ChatGPT,"Hey fellow prompt enthusiasts,

I wanted to share a prompt I’ve been working on that has made meal planning so much easier for me. Whether you’re trying to stick to a specific diet (like keto), save money, or just streamline your grocery shopping, this prompt has been a game-changer.

Here’s what it does:

- Creates a **personalized meal plan** based on user preferences, goals, and cooking habits.

- Generates an **organized grocery list** by store sections (because wandering aimlessly through the aisles isn’t fun).

- Adapts recipes to match your cooking skills and available kitchen tools.

It’s a versatile prompt designed to guide users step-by-step, and I think it’s a great example of how ChatGPT can be used for practical, everyday challenges. Below is the full prompt—feel free to try it out, tweak it, or share your feedback!

  
`You are an AI assistant specializing in creating customized meal plans and grocery shopping lists. Your goal is to guide the user step-by-step in a friendly, adaptable, and slightly humorous tone. Each user should have a unique experience, so vary your phrasing, tone, and approach based on their responses. Follow these instructions:`

`1. Begin with a warm, engaging introduction. Highlight the benefits of working together, such as personalized meal plans, efficient grocery lists, and recipes tailored to their preferences and goals.`

`2. Clearly set expectations for the process and the outcome, emphasizing that they can make adjustments after the plan is generated.`

`3. Ask questions one at a time, keeping the conversation natural and fun. Be adaptable based on their responses—adjust your tone and flow to suit their preferences.`

`4. Once you’ve gathered enough information, generate a detailed meal plan and grocery list.`

`5. Format the grocery list in a way that is easy to copy and paste, organized by common grocery store sections for an efficient shopping experience.`

`6. Invite the user to review the plan and make any changes they’d like.`

`7. After providing the grocery list, recommend additional strategies to help them meet their goals beyond eating properly. For example:`

   `- Suggest tracking food intake using an app like MyFitnessPal.`

   `- Recommend designing a workout plan or incorporating specific exercises based on their goals.`

   `- If saving money is a goal, propose using budgeting tools like Mint or YNAB.`

   `- Offer advice relevant to their unique responses, such as stress management techniques or productivity apps.`

`---`

`### Example Grocery List Formatting:`

`The grocery list should be clearly formatted and categorized into these sections:`

`- **Produce**: Apples, spinach, onions, garlic`  

`- **Meat and Seafood**: Chicken breast, ground beef`  

`- **Dairy**: Eggs, shredded cheese, heavy cream`  

`- **Pantry**: Olive oil, almond flour, spices (paprika, cumin)`  

`- **Frozen**: Frozen cauliflower rice, frozen broccoli`  

`- **Miscellaneous**: Baking parchment, ziplock bags`  

`---`

`### Example Introduction:`

`""Hi there! I’m your meal-planning sidekick, ready to whip up a plan tailored to you. Together, we’ll create:`

`- A meal plan designed for your lifestyle, tastes, and goals.`

`- A grocery list so efficient, it’ll save you time, money, and decision fatigue.`

`- Recipes that fit your skills, schedule, and even your favorite kitchen gadgets.`

`It’s easy: I’ll ask a few fun, straightforward questions to learn about your food preferences, goals, and cooking habits. By the end, you’ll have a plan so personalized, it’ll feel like a gift to your future self.`

`---`

   `- Follow-up: ""Where do you usually shop? (E.g., Meijer, Costco, Aldi, Whole Foods, or your local market?)""`

   `- Next: ""Where are you located? (City, state, or country—it helps me tailor the plan to what’s available near you!)""`

`---`

`### 10. **Custom Requests**`

Completed installing my MK4 to MK4S upgrade last night and waited to run the checks till this morning. Excited this morning, with coffee, all was good until the heater tests.

It is now failing the ""6. heater test - nozzle heater check - heater testing"" step. Seems like it is not heating up fast enough. Fails me at around 170 degrees before reaching 290 and just stops heating the nozzle and finishing the heatbed test.

Odd because none of those components are part of the upgrade. Double odd because the test is skipped in the instructions... [https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-preflight-check\_754328](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/6-preflight-check_754328) between step 6 and 7 it does the heater test despite not being listed on the guide.

Ran through the troubleshooting step here: [https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-mk4-s-mk3-9\_417808#troubleshooting](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/selftest-failed-mk4-s-mk3-9_417808#troubleshooting)

\-No QR code generated.  
\-checked thermoresistor cable both plug end and sensor, no kinks or damage.  
\-check heater cable both ends, no kink or damage.  
\-tried with new sock and without, setting changed in HW menu to correspond to both.  
\-removed hot end and re-seated several times, gentle pressure upwards and flush [as described](https://cdn.help.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/6b12092de314941616ca75c2cfed543d_painted.jpeg).

Disassembled the hot end just to take a better look at each part as well. Photos here: [https://imgur.com/a/LnAF74N](https://imgur.com/a/LnAF74N) again nothing obviously wrong, that I can tell at least.

Live chat came up before I finished typing... Tech support chat seems to be really laggy, they asked for resistance values. I got the below for each:

99.5 on 200k ohm for thermo  
16.3 on 200 ohm for heater

We shall see what they come back with... extra slow chat message style...

edit 1: what is the white paste on the heater? Thermal paste? Like the same style as a CPU? It was kind of stuck in there and hard to remove. Probably need to reapply it... whatever is is.

Tech support is also having me do a hard reset and reflash.....

edit 2: resistor values are in spec. Hard reset completed. Still failed the nozzle heater test. Stops at 170 just like before. Live chat appears to be contemplating existence and the human condition before responding.......

re-assembly photos I was asked to take: [https://imgur.com/a/56GeEVz](https://imgur.com/a/56GeEVz) In case I jacked it up. I did not reapply mystery heater paste.",2,1735318704.0,prusa3d,1,1.0,False

Over the course of the dinner, I found my mom’s interactions with our server (who was excellent) to be rude and unacceptable.

First, mom is allergic to crab (we were at a seafood restaurant, which was her request). Without looking at her, she asked the server if there was crab in the dish she was ordering. Server said no, and if that’s an allergy, we’re very careful about that/ no cross-contamination/the manager brings it out to you personally/etc. Ends by saying “so rest assured we’re very careful about that”. After this above and beyond response, my mom (continuing to not address the server) looks down and murmurs into her menu “yeah well I guess you’d have to be.” Server is not sure how to respond, but smiles and continues about taking the the order.

Later, my mom has stopped eating and my gf and I have cleaned our plates. This is maybe 45 min in. Server comes around and says “are we maybe slowing down there, and would you like a box?”. Again, mom stares down into her plate, and murmurs “no actually still working on it.” This is a kind of loud restaurant so the server
 is really struggling to hear this, so I restate it for her, looking at her and saying it in a friendly and polite manner for my mom. 

Anyways, this is a celebratory dinner and we are likely going to be in there for another half hour (order desert, coffee etc), and her behavior is embarrassing for me, so I say “Mom why are you being so snooty to the waitress?” She immediately denies any said snootiness. I reply “when people are speaking with you it is polite and good to look at them.” 

She fusses about this and then makes a show of “apologizing” to the server because “my son seems to think I was being rude.” 

I think I may have had a little too harsh a tone when I called her out, but I found her behavior terribly rude. Is it just me? Was I out of line? AITJ?",7,1735318526.0,AmITheJerk,4,1.0,False

We see each other in person 2-4 times out the week and we have a great relationship.
Side note, I’m a mother of a 4yr old little girl and rarely find any downtime for myself. Especially during the holidays, she’s home 24/7 because schools out and she takes up a lot of attention, as she should. That being said, I sometimes don’t make calling my bf my first priority. I like to start my mornings with a hot coffee, home cooked breakfast and some screen time. This means I go a couple of hrs without actually reaching out to him and he finds this upsetting. He recently called me at 10am, around the time I was finishing up my breakfast, and the first words he utters are “HELLO, do you even love me anymore” (ofc in a joking manner, but with an underlining of seriousness) I’m immediately defensive because the last few days I’ve initiated the morning calls and I feel as though even when I do try to match his effort, it’s not appreciated because the one time I let some time go by, he becomes insecure as if I don’t show him any love. He says the amount of communication on my end could be better and that I’m not putting in the effort I used to in the very beginning of our relationship. Keep in mind, in the beginning I was clingy and wanted his attention 24/7. But being 3 years in, I’ve become comfortable and content with what we’re able to give each other. 
After giving it some thought I decided to still apologize and reassure him that I love him and that he is a priority, BUT I resent this a bit because the day has barely started and I’m getting shit for not calling already. To this he says “it’s not just that, it only takes a second to send a text or a snap.” But excuse me for being mentally exhausted from my everyday life with my child. Am I the asshole for not calling him as much as he likes? It’s not like we’re even talking about anything profound, it’s usually just the typical “hey, how’s your morning going?” And it may only be a 10-20 minute call, AND THATS PERFECTLY FINE! But can I just live my life and call him when I’m ready and not on HIS preferred time? What should I do? I’ve already expressed to him that I feel like I can do no right when it comes to this issue.

Hi everyone.
I have been trying to switch from Spravato treatments to compounded ketamine at-home treatments. I first tried a ketamine nasal spray but it wasn’t working for me. I didn’t feel like I was absorbing it. So, I decided to give the trochees a try. Those were even worse/leas effective. Then I thought maybe I would try ketamine in a nebulizer. I ran this by my doctors and they know I research everything before I do it so they told me if I could find a way to make it work, cool. I spoke to some pharmacists, found out the inactive ingredients in a ketamine nasal spray, and decided eh…don’t know if I want to put that in my lungs. I tried asking Dave from Keystone RX for info but he wasn’t very…eager to talk to me. He wasn’t rude, he was nice given that he was talking to a stranger, who isn’t a doctor, about ketamine. But I explained everything as quickly as a could and he said he wouldn’t do nebulized ketamine because he doesn’t know what ketamine does to the lungs nor how much ketamine I would be wasting by exhaling. I’ve found a few pubmed articles on nebulized ketamine that I plan to read. Anyway, Dave also said that he doesn’t share his formulas with people (other pharmacists) 🙄 and that he doesn’t have the time to talk to them (i asked if he would be willing to talk to mine because the pharmacists in my state are behind when it comes to ketamine research and they don’t know how to compound a nasal spray higher than 100ml/mg. He said they sound 12 years behind but he’s not gonna talk to them and that they can call PCCA for info. He also said he was a member of ASKP which I have found an informative website. Also I tried to mention his RX’s youtube channel and how I found the videos very helpful and I was grateful but he ignored each comment lol. I think it was mostly just because he is busy and probably has customers to deal with, maybe needs a cup of coffee, didn’t really want to talk to me. But hey, I’ll take what I can get. Our brief convo was enlightening even though he didn’t want to talk to me. 
One of my drs who is a surgeon was very into the nebulizer idea, even took me back to his surgery room and gave me some supplies (mask, tubing) and show me some nebulizers on amazon that you can get for like $40. 
So I will speak to him about all this once he comes back from the holidays, (and i’ll keep research) but atp, nebulized ketamine doesn’t seem optimal. So my best bet is nasal spray! I just need to figure out the most effective way of using it, fiddle with the dose and timing and all that. 
I would like to hear your experiences and advice. 
My last post got removed by mods because it was too “diy-ketamine.” 
So, I would like to make it clear I am not recommending doing any kind of at-home-trials without the approval of your provider (which I have).
I am not expert or doctor, the opposite in fact, just here trying to glean as much info from fellow patients as I can. Thank you.

I’m linking my previous posts here in order of when oldest to most recent. Thank you very much to everyone who has replied to these posts because it’s been quite helpful.

I have had a bowl of mini wheats and a cup of coffee with coffee mate today which is my normal breakfast that never causes stomach issues and have had a normal BM about two hours ago. I have been drinking water off and on. 

The pain isn’t going away when I am sitting or trying to walk around to get my mind off of it.  I can’t tell if I’m just experiencing trapped gas or something to be concerned about since the pain is not something I have experienced before when I have had a stomach ache like I need to use the restroom. It isn’t the feeling of cramps or upset stomach pain either.  If it is my gallbladder and needs attention, I would be throwing up and unable to walk right?

1hnj3cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcousticGuitar/comments/1hnj3cz/fixing_a_yamaha_jr1/,Fixing a Yamaha jr-1,"I got a good deal on an old jr-1, and it isn't really worth taking to a luthier to fix. Was already a little beaten and only $20 for a functioning ""toy"", I just wanted a small beater that fits in my car easier than a full size dreadnaught that I can take on road trips or play at my kid's preschool for enrichment activities.

I've had it for a while now, and found it plays best in d standard. If I tune it to e standard, it harmonizes and buzzes like crazy. Its like something inside is peeling apart and sounds almost distorted. Natural harmonics sound like a phone vibrating on a coffee table. Tapped harmonics aren't so bad but it's subtle.

The neck is straight and the action is good, set up the same as my other guitars. The scratchplate is secure, the hardware is tight (when I got it the low e string in the bridge pin was slightly bored open so I guess previous owner forced a pin in and opened the hole. The pin sticks out about a quarter inch but holds tune) 

I'm using Ernie ball earth wounds like I use on every other acoustic. I think these have medium lights on vs all the others with mediums.

Is this just something that I have to deal with and keep it a step down, or is there possibly something going on with the bracing inside causing it to use it in e?

I'm just wondering if these are typical symptoms or should I be pushing for even more deeper medical intervention.  (FYI - there is a referral in for a CT scan and my Pancreatic Elastase test came back at 65 ug/gram).

Here are my newest symptoms that I suspect might be from malnutrition, but these are in addition to a number of other symptoms including unintended weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, brain fog, diarrhea, pale fatty stool:

* Constant hunger - I'm hungry all the time, but especially when I first wake up.  I'm ""hungry"" even when I'm physically full.
* Craving red meat - especially rare red meat.  I've been iron deficient anemic for a long time, but usually my cravings associated with that are more in the Pica category (Sonic ice is the BEST)
* Craving cheese and milk - especially high fat versions, mozzarella isn't cutting it
* Craving orange juice - not really oranges but OJ specifically.  I've never really been a big OJ fan so this one is odd.
* Constant Thirst - I'm drinking at least 72 ounces of water a day, no coffee, also add in herbal non-caffeinated tea as a hot drink.

* **Ingredients:** Apple cider, fresh rosemary, lemon juice, club soda, cinnamon stick, and ice.
* **Why this works:** The warm, smoky apple flavor combined with the freshness of rosemary is so comforting and perfect for winter. Lighting the rosemary garnish adds drama and makes it feel like a drink you'd pay $15 for at a craft cocktail bar.
* **Method:**
   * Simmer apple cider with a cinnamon stick and rosemary sprig for 10 minutes, then cool.
   * Fill a shaker with ice, 2 oz of the cider, 1 oz lemon juice, and shake.
   * Strain into a glass, top with club soda, and garnish with a rosemary sprig (light it for extra flair!).

# 2. Cucumber Mint Cooler

* **Ingredients:** Fresh cucumber juice, lime juice, mint leaves, simple syrup, and sparkling water.
* **Why this works:** It’s ridiculously refreshing and feels spa-like, but also fancy because of the muddled mint and cucumber juice. Great for keeping things light and bright!
* **Method:**
   * Muddle mint with simple syrup in a shaker.
   * Add cucumber juice, lime juice, and ice, then shake well.
   * Strain into a glass filled with ice, top with sparkling water, and garnish with a cucumber ribbon and mint sprig.

# 3. Passionfruit and Ginger Mule

* **Ingredients:** Passionfruit puree, ginger beer, lime juice, honey, and ice.
* **Why this works:** This one packs a tropical punch with the passionfruit and a zippy kick from the ginger beer. It’s bold, flavorful, and feels exotic—perfect for a party!
* **Method:**
   * Mix 1 oz passionfruit puree, ½ oz honey, and 1 oz lime juice.
   * Add ice, then top with ginger beer.
   * Serve in a copper mug (or any fun glass!) and garnish with candied ginger and a lime wheel.

# 4. Cranberry Thyme Sparkler

* **Ingredients:** Cranberry juice, thyme syrup (equal parts sugar, water, and thyme simmered together), lime juice, and soda water.
* **Why this works:** The cranberry makes it festive, while the thyme syrup adds a sophisticated herbal twist. It’s like Christmas and New Year’s had a baby in a glass.
* **Method:**
   * Combine cranberry juice, lime juice, and thyme syrup in a shaker with ice.
   * Shake, strain into a coupe glass, and top with soda water.

* **Method:**
   * Shake 2 oz pineapple juice, 1 oz coconut cream, ½ oz orgeat, and 1 oz lime juice with ice.
   * Strain over crushed ice in a tiki mug and garnish with a pineapple leaf and cherry.

# 6. Espresso Tonic with Orange Zest

* **Ingredients:** Cold espresso, tonic water, simple syrup, and orange zest.
* **Why this works:** The bitterness of espresso and tonic creates a super unique, adult flavor, while the orange zest brightens it up. Perfect for coffee lovers who want something non-alcoholic but still chic.
* **Method:**
   * Fill a glass with ice, add 1 oz simple syrup, and slowly pour 4 oz tonic water.
   * Layer 2 oz cold espresso over the tonic.
   * Garnish with orange zest.

# Pro Tips to Elevate Your Game:

1. **Batch Mixers Ahead of Time:** Prep syrups and juice blends in advance so you can enjoy the party too.
2. **Make It Beautiful:** Think fun garnishes like edible flowers, sugared rims, or dramatic ice cubes.
3. **Glassware Matters:** Use different glasses—highballs, coupes, or even vintage finds. The right glass makes a drink feel extra special.
4. **Don’t Skimp on Ice:** Fancy ice cubes (clear or oversized spheres) are surprisingly impressive.

OHey! First off, it’s awesome that you’re hosting a booze-free New Year’s party—it shows how much you care about your family.

//background  
I am fairly a noob to the world of brewing. Got on it once I started abstaining from alcohol lol. Seen too many liverdoc posts on twitter //iykyk.

//equipment I have on me

I have a bunch of beginner-moderate equipment like an electric burr grinder, frenchpress, aeropress and a very basic digital scale. I'd prefer not to invest further until I absolutely feel I need something more.

//beans

I've tried experimenting with a variety of beans too, the Blue Tokai Vienna roast, Mulberry light roast and some Medium Roast Coarse but none seem to have given good enough results.  
I am still not sure, what beans Blue Tokai uses on these cans? I am contemplating to handsomely tip the local Barista :p (near my home in Blr) but I doubt if he'd even know.

//methods tried  
Have a bunch of 200 ml glass bottles to experiment with.

I don't brew in the fridge as I am very skeptical of extraction at such a low temperature. So unless I am milk-brewing instead of water-brewing, I avoid the fridge.

I've experimented with Fine Grind -> 18h on 12g - 200ml water, 12g - 200 ml - 24h and 12g - 200ml -48h. Only the 24h and 48h felt strong enough / palatable. Please guide me here. I am probably effing it up here bigtime

//Objectives so far

How important is the grind and duration here? There are two outcomes and one constraint I am hoping to optimize the whole exercise for. I would love to

Maximize the Caffeine because I am a junkie

Maximise on the Taste. Love Sour tones a lot more than Bitter. Not a big fan of sweet. I switched to cold brewing over an iced Americano because iced Americano felt bitter and over-extracted

Minimise on the cost. One reason to use fine grind and brew for longer is to ensure by my *baniya-math* that I am getting the *bang* for my buck. But I don't mind skipping this once or twice a week provided I have perfected the recipe and can compromise by expending more beans for the assured richer taste :)

1hniw0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Minimum_Attitude_591/comments/1hniw0s/turf_wars/,Turf Wars,"Jojo and I are currently involved in a turf war. Before I came along, all these fellas lived together like heathens. The boys were feral. Mister was feral. All of the blankets were scratchy and dark colored. I personally felt like I was revisiting my twenties, when one night stands landed me in the rooms of boys with new freedom and no apparent home training. 
My boys had never felt the absolute luxury of soft fabrics that smelled like lady and vanilla. Jojo has taken to the softness a bit too much if you ask me. He has his own beds okay? But he prefers mine because I like satin and fuzzy things. I literally just picked him up and put him on his bed but alas, 24 seconds later he has nestled himself atop my nest on the couch. 
Can’t say that I blame him but also, of the two cats, he inflames my allergies the most. 
We’ve been fighting like crips and bloods over my nest. Some nights, all I have to do is go to the bathroom and upon my return he is snoozing cozily in my spot as if he had been there the entire time. I make his dad move him because I have worn the “wicked Step Mother” label before and it’s not one I want to wear again. 

Mister and I had a “talk lite” this morning about the Christmas disaster. We both made apologies. Christmas is hard for him too but for different reasons. We both shared that we feel extra alone on that day. 
But we don’t have to anymore. 
The talk went well and then I asked him to order some kombucha and coffee because supplies are running dangerously low. 

So I went into shock when he showed me the ring last night. 
It’s not an uncommon response. I’ve had it every single time someone has asked me to marry them. (5 times to be exact). 
I’m not sure why I respond in this way. I have been waiting to get married my entire life. When I was a child playing house with my friends, k never pretended to be a mom. I pretended to be a wife. This is largely due to weird church customs. I’m aware. Marriage hysteria swept through my youth group when I was like 12 and while everyone’s future spouse was being revealed to them through the power of prayer, I was being told that I had demons inside of me. 
Do you know how hard it is to get a prophecy for marriage when you’re told that you have demons inside of you in front of the entire church? 

I’ve spent the last few years processing this shit hardcore. At some point, I just realized that marriage probably wasn’t going to happen for me and I couldn’t keep my life in a holding chamber anymore. On some level I believed that my life wouldn’t begin until I got married. It’s an old idea left over from my church days and luckily, it’s all the way gone now. I’m now facing the luxury of CHOICE. Something that I didn’t know I had before. 

When the other Guys asked me to marry them, I generally felt that I had no other options. Or I felt something akin to “I had already paid for the tickets, may as well see the show.” Or I just wanted to be engaged. The exception to this is my daughter’s father. I somehow believed that if we got married his behavior towards me would change. I truly believe he would transform into this gentle, kind, disciplined, benevolent man once he was legally and spiritually bound to me. 
But that’s little girl stuff. That’s magical thinking. 
Nobody changes unless they want to. 

Marriage wasn’t an option in my last relationship. I was experimenting with “polyamory” though I wasn’t practicing it myself. That relationship broke my heart over and over and over again. As much as I loved the fella, every time there was an opportunity for an advancement in our relationship, one of the three of us just shit the bed. When we first decided to date, we talked about how far we could take the relationship. I needed to know what I was getting myself into and he assured me that we could be as normal as American apple pie, we just couldn’t get married. He even mentioned at one point that I could just change my last name if we wanted to make it a permanent thing. I was fine with that. I liked the idea even. As time moved forwards, I clung to that conversation. For three years. For three years, I just wanted to find my place in that relationship and as time went on it became abundantly clear that there would never be a place for me. Not with him. 
The grief was incredible. I mourned for him and them and our make believe future like I have never grieved for a relationship before. Maybe it was my new found sobriety. Maybe it was the loss of the family I had made with d that made the ending of this incredibly important relationship so deeply painful. Maybe it was just the straw that broke the camels back. I suspect it’s a little bit of everything; but at some point, I just had to look at what was happening instead of resting in the assurance of my love for him. 
The last time we spoke I realized that my love for him was similar to the love that I had for alcohol. I kept drinking hoping that I would have an amazing time…like the old days when I partied with rock stars and was whisked away to different cities for new experiences. But drinking stopped being that way for me eventually. Eventually, only bad stuff happened, I felt like absolute shit the next day and I had no money. 
I kept drinking hoping it would get better but it didn’t, everything got worse. At some point, I had to stop drinking because I came to believe that the magic of drinking was lost and now I was just insane. And that’s how I began to feel about my last relationship. Love aside. Love is just a portion of the big picture. I kept going back to him hoping he would finally find a nest for me….but he didn’t and wouldn’t and he wasn’t going to. And I needed to just accept that. 
So I did. 
It wasn’t long before mister came along. 
Well. He had been there the whole time. 

He wanted to marry me like within weeks lol. I told him multiple times we needed to pass certain milestones before that could be an actual conversation. We have passed those milestones. And he is eager to make me his wife. 

The ring is beautiful. And unique. I did not expect the ring he showed me. It kind of took me by surprise. It’s a really fine, beautiful moss agate with diamonds and white gold. Very unique. I can say that he is the first of all my suitors that has selected a ring that represents how he sees me. He’s spent weeks looking for it and I guess he kept returning to this specific ring. I find it coincidental that I have been waiting my entire life for a moss agate ring to find me. Feels like kind of a full circle moment. 
He didn’t even know that I have been waiting for the perfect moss agate ring to find me. He just picked it because it most fit how he sees me. 
 
When he showed me the ring, memories of the first moss agate ring flooded my consciousness. Someone in the church gave one of my friends a moss agate ring and I was desperately jealous. 
It was soooo beautiful and she wore it so smugly. When I had the chance to visit the woman who gave her the ring, I was sent home with an organizer and sunblock. lol
I was stunned when he showed me the ring. I could only nod in acknowledgment. Mainly because…. It’s happening.

I’m not quite sure how to process it and I won’t have therapy until after the new year. 
It’s important to me to say “yes” this time because I mean it. Because I can see a future with him. I can. We get along very well. Things that have been stumbling blocks in prior relationships are things that we move through with ease. He genuinely likes me in all of my manifestations. He knows me and he knows things about me that I didn’t necessarily know about myself. He pays close attention to me and calls me out when I am acting a fool. He tells me that he is proud of me. He jokes that his friends love me more than him. In turn, I have so much respect for the work he has done on himself. I appreciate his goodness and his softness. I love how unique he is and how loyal he is to himself and his character. I see his vulnerability and cherish it. He’s my best friend. We have difficulty in the lover department but I suspect and hope that will change when we have more space. Right now, if we were any closer to each other in proximity, he would be inside me. 
I have faith in our ability to communicate and work towards the greater good of OUR family. He has a place for me in his life and I have occupied that place with my satin pink pillows and fuzzy pink blankets. ",1,1735317654.0,u_Minimum_Attitude_591,0,1.0,False

This post can only really give you a snapshot of the area in this moment, but bellow is a list of resources that should keep you up to date on everything from large city events and restaurant openings to pop-up concerts and theater events. 

 

* Events - City of minneapolis event calendar - [https://www.minneapolis.org/calendar/](https://www.minneapolis.org/calendar/) 
* Events - Eventbrite - [https://www.eventbrite.com/](https://www.eventbrite.com/) 
   * If you haven't heard of it already I would be shocked, but this is eventbrite, it's like ticketmaster(if it didn't suck) for all sized events. More events are posted here than all the other resources combined.
* Events - Explore minnesota - [https://www.exploreminnesota.com/things-to-do/events-minneapolis-st-paul-area](https://www.exploreminnesota.com/things-to-do/events-minneapolis-st-paul-area) 
   * This is definitely the best event calendar of all the resources, when im looking for something spontaneous to do that weekend or even that night i usually use this. 
* Events & Food - Minneapolis st Paul magazine - [https://mspmag.com/](https://mspmag.com/) 
* Events & Food -RacketMN - [racketmn.com](http://racketmn.com) 
* Food - TwinCities Eater - [https://twincities.eater.com/](https://twincities.eater.com/) 
   * This is by far my favorite resource, they'll let you know what restaurants are about to open, which are closing, re-opening, unionizing, award nominated, and award winning. It’s not only checking regularly, but there back catalogue is fantastic as well. 
* live music - Under Current MPLS - [https://www.facebook.com/UnderCurrentMPLS](https://www.facebook.com/UnderCurrentMPLS) 
   * This one is a facebook page, but its amazing! They post most days and will give you an extensive list of live music events happening that night.



Reviewers 

One of the best ways to keep up to date on everything is to retrain your algorithms to send more local posts your way, and the best way to do so is to start following local reviewers. Bellow is a list of mostly tik-tokers(though most can be found on instagram as well) that review local events and restaurants

","Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. Just got back from my third Asia trip and I'm still amazed by how many incredible places there are to explore in this part of the world!

Let me share some absolute gems I've discovered. First off, you can't go wrong with Japan's blend of ancient and ultra-modern - from the serene temples of Kyoto to the crazy Robot Restaurant in Tokyo. The cherry blossom season is pure magic!

Over in Thailand, skip the touristy areas and head straight to Chiang Mai. The night markets are incredible, and the food... oh man, the food! Pro tip: take a cooking class there - best decision ever.

Vietnam completely stole my heart. Ha Long Bay looks like something from another planet, and Hoi An's lantern-lit streets at night are literally straight out of a fairy tale. Plus, the coffee culture there is next level.

South Korea's often overlooked but trust me - Seoul's energy is infectious, and Jeju Island is like Hawaii meets Korea (but way cheaper). The street food scene will have you coming back for more!

There's actually tons more amazing spots across Asia that I'd love to tell you about (I've written about my top 10 bucket-list worthy places in this article [here](https://asiajourney.org/10-breathtaking-asian-destinations-for-your-2025/), if you're curious to dive deeper).

One thing I've learned: Asia's tourist spots are incredible, but it's the unexpected discoveries and local interactions that really make your trip special. Like this tiny ramen shop I found in a Tokyo alley, or the elderly couple who invited me to their home for tea in Bali...

What about you guys? Any hidden gems in Asia you've discovered that surprised you? Would love to hear your stories and maybe get some ideas for my next trip!

P.S. Don't forget to check out that article I mentioned above - it's packed with all the details about my favorite spots and some practical tips I wish I'd known before visiting!",1,1735317553.0,AsiaTraveltips,0,1.0,False

I (24F) was with my ex-bf (25M) for about 6 months. He was my first real relationship as an adult and I really felt head over heels for him.

The only issue we had that we talked about was his family- they live in the middle east and are religious muslims. They never knew about me, which was an issue for me- I didn't wan to be a secret forever. We talked about it and I trusted that he would tell them when the time was right. He went to visit them for about 3 weeks and got back to he states a couple of weeks ago. We've hung out almost everyday since- I was his plus one to a wedding and we went on a day trip together.

Yesterday, I noticed he had removed my contact photo. I didn't ask about it at the time, but he ended up calling me that night and I asked about it. He took it down when he was visiting his family so they wouldn't see. I never felt like he was embarrassed of me because I was pretty integrated into his friend group.

It turned into two 30 minute phone calls, one where he said he wasn't sure he'd ever tell his parents about me until he knew that I was one the one, and the next where he said he's been unsure about out relationship for the past month or two. Right before he told me that, I told him I was starting to have more serious feelings and he admitted that he didn't feel the same.This was after we spent the holidays together. I felt heartbroken but we agreed to to talk this morning.

I went to his place this morning and we talked. He said he wasn't sure if I was the one, and he felt like he should know by now. I told him I felt very blindsided by our conversation yesterday and he apologized for not talking to me sooner. I told him I thought about what I wanted in a relationship and that I didn't want to be in a relationship where I had to be a secret. We ended on good terms overall, we have similar hobbies so we'll run into each other at some point. 

I just have no idea how to process this. This time yesterday we were having coffee together and I had no idea he had any of these feelings. I'm just shocked- we spent so much time together and now I have no idea what to do. I've been crying since I left his place. I'm used to falling asleep with him and mornings with him. I already made an appointment with my therapist for right after new years. I feel like I'm not coping well- how do I even start to process this?",1,1735317063.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I had gotten it for a reasonable price, and I was already thinking about what furniture I could buy to fill out the empty rooms.

The place was all mine. No relatives. No roommate. I was ecstatic, and I was eager to start dating in a new town.

Then the trouble began in one of the worst places I could’ve imagined: the bathroom.

Who tries out the bathroom in a house before you buy it? Nobody ever mentioned giving the toilet a spin.

There I was, though, sitting on the toilet after drinking my morning coffee. I was reading the news on my phone, relaxed, when I heard a hiss from below. Then I was jabbed with a stinging pain on my left buttocks.

I yelled and jumped up off the toilet. I turned around to see what had just bit me and saw nothing there but my own feces.

That really freaked me out. Had a snake crawled up the pipes?

I inspected myself in the mirror and saw two red puncture marks that had to have come from the fangs of some creature.

I didn’t know if I should call a plumber or animal control, so I called both. The plumber assured me that no snake had gone up the pipes in my house. Animal control told me that there weren’t even any venomous snakes native to the area.

I was so rattled that I decided not to use the toilet in my home for a little while. This was going fine until one day at the office I was on the toilet when I felt the same stabbing pain in the same spot.

Over the next few months I scoured my house and the surrounding area for some sign of snakes. What I found was unexpected.

Buried in my backyard was a shoebox with a note from a boy called Alex who used to live in the house. He wrote about another boy, Wally, who used to live in the town and how everyone at school made fun of strange Wally who used to bring his pet snake to school.

Alex was a bully, and he recalled a few incidents where he shoved Wally’s head in the toilet of the school bathroom. Wally died after he was bitten by a rattlesnake while on vacation. After that, Alex experienced the same type of bite as I had, over and over again.

His theory was that Wally was taking revenge from the grave. Alex explained, “after you get bitten once and receive the poison, it will follow you wherever you go.”

I learned later that Alex committed suicide many years ago.

I have found a way to avoid the same fate, though it isn’t ideal. I wear diapers everywhere I go and soil myself every time I feel the urge. I haven’t been bitten in years, but it hasn’t been easy to explain to the women I bring home.",4,1735316831.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Most women describe me as tall dark and handsome, yet funny and smart. For the past year I've been working out, dressing better and getting better at conversation.

Once a week I get together with guy friends to go to pubs and I've met at least a dozen women. It makes me feel young to connect with women who show interest in me. 

Yet my hardwired catholic guilt gets in the way. My partner has had all sorts of medical issues and I help to care for her both physically and financially.

There's this one woman I met. Divorced, tall and blonde with a great sense of humor and a successful career.

I met her six months ago and we talked until the lights came on at the bar. We kissed at the end of the night and she invited me back to her house, but I said no.

We talked and texted in the weeks after that I got friend zoned and she made it clear that she didn't wanna mess with a married guy. I tried to meet for coffee a couple of times but she was always too busy, so I took the hint. I deleted her from my contacts and just decided to let it go.

But last night, I ran into her at the pub once again. Her eyes lit up when she saw me, she gave me like five romantic hugs and a kiss. Fuck, this is like five times more affection that I've had in the past two years over the course of 20 minutes.

She then got a little standoffish and said that she was there to spend time with her girlfriend that night. She made it clear that she did want to meet sometime for coffee and talk. 

I haven't texted her yet. I know I am being foolish and stupid, but it is what it is.",0,1735316468.0,DeadBedrooms,4,0.5,False

1hnichx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hnichx/it_sucks_that_i_though_that_they_are_my_friends/,It sucks that I though that they are my friends ,"I am a member and an officer of a small chapel choir club in a university, since we are small we are close with each other and we have an opportunity to meet and bond with the alumni in serving the masses.

We have activities in our club that are related in serving the church/chapel. After that we will have an after club activity which we will go outside of the university and do the activities that aren’t related in the club (ex: eating dinner, go karaoke).


It happened last April, an alumnus was planning for a get together after the club activity.  After the club activity, we stayed outside in the office since it was occupied, and the members slowly left. A club officer asked me where will I go and I told him that I don’t know where to go (context: I was grieving at that time since I cut off my best friend). So he replied “there’s (name) and (name) over there so you can go talk to them, I will go home now bye”. So I sat with them in silence and I felt numb.

When I went at my dorm, I checked my Instagram. They went out for a coffee. I react a heart on their stories. The club officer removed me on their close friend list and the members and alumni who are involved removed it on their instagram story. It sucks that the ribbon I gave to the freshman gave it to an alumni (context: there’s a ribbon activity and I gave them a yellow ribbon that means I want to be friends with them). So I cried a couple of hours till I fall asleep.

The day after there’s a meeting for all clubs in the university, The club officer and I were the representative of the meeting. I tried to be professional and acted being blind of what happened in the situation that same goes with the club officer. After that I poured it all out.

Whenever I see their IG stories of their circle or someone who would mention on their other group chat, I would somehow reminisce that have happened last April.

At this point I do not know if they are my friends or do I really have a friend in college",2,1735316224.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
