1hd08z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/1hd08z6/other_benefits_of_transitioning_to_staking_reward/,Other benefits of transitioning to Staking Reward,"Just my morning coffee thoughts.

- Projects built on Algorand can benefit from an additional, lower-risk income stream through staking rewards, reducing their dependence on external grants for sustainability and growth.
- One of the key features of Algorand's staking rewards is its seamless integration with wallet balances. When additional ALGO is added to a wallet linked to a node, the probability of generating a block increases instantly, without requiring users to wait for a specific number of blocks. This dynamic system not only encourages active participation and makes the staking process more efficient and user-friendly but also has the potential to drive increased demand for ALGO, strengthening the ecosystem overall and its price. 
- With a low barrier to entry—requiring only an affordable computer and approximately $12.6k USD ($0.42 per ALGO) to stake 30,000 ALGO—there is significant potential to attract and onboard tech-savvy individuals into the Algorand ecosystem. 
- Increased community engagement is essential, as staking pools must establish credibility to earn the trust of users. Algonauts are likely to prioritize staking pools that actively contribute to the growth and development of the Algorand ecosystem, aligning with the community’s values and long-term vision.
- Algonauts can also show their support for individual contributors, such as u/GhostOfMcAfee, by staking in their staking pools if there's any, fostering a stronger and more inclusive community within the Algorand ecosystem.

For example, someone making $1k a day might spend $20 daily on coffee at a café, while someone making $4k a day might spend only $2 by brewing their coffee at home.

Higher income doesn’t necessarily mean higher spending—it depends on habits, priorities, and choices. It’s a mindset thing, not a money thing.

We weren't allowed to help them. [Part 2],"[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fca2gu/every_night_a_different_person_walks_down_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) the story so far. I know it's been a while. That's my bad. But a lot has happened since I last wrote, and I feel you all deserve to know what happened.

I don't know if I can ever explain it. But I'll try. 

""Hey, Arden... there's someone on the phone for you. Would you come here?"" 

I looked up from the book I had been pretending to read, resting against my folded up legs. I often found myself in this position these days, sitting in my parent's kitchen on the window nook, crumpled up as tightly as I could manage. Every morning my back ached like I had aged forty years overnight. 

My mother stood in the doorway, tapping her foot impatiently. She did it like she thought I would think she was being subtle, one hand on her hip and the other clutching our boxy landline phone. I blinked in surprise. 

""On the landline?"" 

""Not everyone has a fancy new cell phone, Arden. Now take it, my hand is cramping up."" 

I was surprised at how easy it had been to move out of the apartments, but I wasn't surprised my parents had let me move back in. I expected more pushback from our landlord, but my parents, my mother specifically... it was like she was always waiting for me to prove her right. When I told her I was coming home, she sighed, and I swore I could hear the hint of a smile in her tone. *""What happened now, honey?""*

But I knew I couldn't complain, and she knew it too. I had reached the end of the line. There was nothing else to do... after what I saw, I wasn't sure I could ever live alone again, frankly. 

I stood and walked over to her, thanking her under my breath and taking the phone. She huffed and marched off, and I was left there alone, staring at the receiver, my face slack. It was like I knew before I even brought it up to my ear. 

""Hello? Who is this?"" 

""Hey, Arden."" Her voice was angry, a hint of red hot frustration weaving between each punchy letter, but there was something else there too. I felt my face go pale. ""Sorry to call you like this. You haven't been answering your cell, so I found this number in the phonebook."" 

Guilt stabbed at my gut like a hot poker. I glanced over at my cell phone, which sat on the kitchen table... I knew it had been wrong, but I had blocked all of their numbers the day after I got out of there. I didn't want to think about it, any of it. I didn't want any connection to that cursed place. 

""Hi, Gianna."" 

""Yeah, hi,"" she snapped, sounding more annoyed by the second. ""Look, I know you had to leave. I get that. We would too if that was an option..."" She trailed off, leaving the rest unsaid, but heavily implied: I was simply luckier than they were. ""...but you need to come back."" 

""What!?"" I exclaimed, louder than I meant to. I winced, only continuing when I heard no angry shout to quiet down from the other room. ""What? Why?"" 

She sighed loudly, and it was like I could hear her face sinking. I could hear her resolve slipping, and her feet pacing around her room. I knew that something had to be wrong, something worse than what had already been wrong. Something big. 

""It's Mey,"" she said finally, and my heart jumped. The hot poker in my stomach twisted. ""Listen, I can't explain over the phone. I just need you to come back. It's important."" 

I faltered. I felt my eyes sting. As soon as I left, I knew I could never come back... I could never associate myself with that place ever again. Nothing about that neighborhood made any sense to me, I didn't trust it. I didn't even know if I could trust Gianna. 

But Mey... 

The day I left, her eyes were still swollen. She hadn't stopped weeping since Will was taken. 

""*Don't go,*"" she said to me. She couldn't even look at me, her head bowed, sitting motionless on her bed. 

""*I'm sorry.*"" 

""*Something bad will happen if you go. I just feel it. Please don't go, Arden.*"" 

I knew. I just didn't want to know. I knew if something had happened to Mey, I had to go back. There was no choice, no third option. 

It was my fault. 

""Arden,"" Gianna said, after the silence had hung in the air between us for a good minute. ""Please."" 

""Okay. I'll come back."" 

""Good. Great. Just... be subtle, okay? They're everywhere right now."" 

I heard the phone click, my mouth hanging open to reply, to ask what the hell she meant by that. 

\--

By the time I reached the neighborhood, dusk was creeping across the skyline. I felt a shiver run up my spine, recalling vividly what happened here at night. 

As I drove down our old street at twenty miles an hour, I felt something strange. I felt like I was being watched. When I turned my head curtains pulled shut, people ducked back behind their doors... everything was just out of my sight, in the corner of my eye.

It was even eerier here than it had been when I left, which I hadn't thought possible. 

Gianna met me in front of the apartment building, sitting on the steps and smoking a cigarette between pale, trembling fingers. By the pile of ash and butts beside her, I could tell it wasn't her first. Her red hair was down and frizzy, like she hadn't brushed it in a while, and her eyes looked small and puffy. 

When I parked and got out of the car, she slowly raised her head to look up at me. I couldn't read her expression as she stood, and it occurred to me that she might hit me, or strangle me, or both. 

""Gianna, I-"" 

She cut me off, pulling me into the tightest hug of my life. I swore I could hear my own ribs crack. Her wool scarf scratched against my neck, and her hair stuck to my chapstick. 

""Thank you for coming back,"" she muttered into my ear. ""Fuck you for leaving."" 

I laughed dryly, patting her back awkwardly. ""I deserve that."" 

She finally pulled away, and I tried to gasp for breath as subtly as possible. Jesus, that girl was strong. She smiled at me weakly, readjusting her jacket. 

""Come on, come inside. I know she'll be happy to see you."" 

I froze, my eyebrows cinching into a frown, my heart pounding in my chest. 

""Wait... Mey's here? She wasn't... taken?"" 

Gianna glanced back at me as she mounted the stairs, pressing her lips tightly together. 

""No. She was."" 

\-- 

When we got upstairs, Gianna unlocked her door and looked around, her eyes flickering up and down the hallway. I wanted to ask, but I knew better than to do it there. 

She pushed the door open just enough for us to slip inside, and I followed her lead. I heard her lock the door again behind us as I stared, wide eyed, at her apartment. 

It was a mess. There was almost nothing that wasn't broken, shards of pottery, flower stems, and glass coating the wooden floor. Anything that wasn't bolted down was strewn across the room. The walls were streaked with something that looked suspiciously like dried blood. 

In the corner of the room, Mateo was hunched in front of someone. His hair had grown out a bit, it was looking shaggy, and he seemed like he had lost a bit of weight. 

""It's okay... it's okay... it's just Gianna and Arden... you remember Arden, don't you?"" 

I heard a choked whimpering sound, and then a gurgle. I stood there in front of the door, unable to move, unable to say or do anything. 

Mateo shifted, turning back to look at us, and I saw her. 

I saw her, but she didn't see me. 

Mey sat in the corner, hugging her knees, which were riddled with bruises and scrapes. She was wearing a blue hospital gown and she rocked back and forth in strange, jerky motions. ""Help,"" she whispered, her voice raspy and painful sounding. ""Help, help me..."" Her black hair that was so silky and perfect before was wild now, missing patches, leaving bright red speckled spots of skin behind. Her face was swollen, almost in the way it had been the day I left, and smeared with fresh blood, and her eyes... 

She had no eyes. 

""M-Mey-"" I choked out, forcing sound to leave my throat. I turned away and bent over, heaving and gagging over the pile of shattered ceramics. Gianna placed a hand on my back. 

""She went after Will,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible, her palm making small circles between my shoulder blades. ""A few days after you went home, we heard him out there again. He was calling us by name. She just... couldn't take it."" 

I gagged again, but nothing would come out. Another gurgling moan came from the corner, growing into a whine. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her start to pull at her hair, and Mateo grabbed her wrists. 

""How... why... is she... *here?!*"" 

Gianna took a shaky breath. 

""I went a little crazy when she was taken. I slept in the lobby every night, just waiting for her to come back... when I finally heard her out there a week or so later, Mateo and I ran out there and grabbed her. That white van came, but we managed to get her inside before they caught us..."" 

I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly painfully dry. Gianna glanced around the room, as if someone might be listening to us. 

""They saw us,"" she mumbled, hugging herself. ""Obviously they saw us take her, and there are cameras everywhere... they know we have her. But no one has come for us. It's like they're waiting for something."" 

Mey let out a sob, writhing in Mateo's grip. ""Help, please help... hurts..."" 

My lip trembled. I stood up straight, holding out my hand and creeping toward her. 

""Hi, Mey..."" I bit my lip, fighting back tears. Mey trembled and rocked, her head tilted vaguely in my direction. Where her eyes had been there were only gory holes... *like Shannon. They did the same thing to her that they did to Shannon. It had to be some kind of message...* ""It's me, Arden... I'm here now, I came back..."" 

""There's one more thing,"" Gianna said, and I felt her eyes watching me, cautious. ""The screaming... it stopped. They don't come anymore, the people begging for help... but every night..."" 

Right as she trailed off, the alarm rang out, more deafening than ever. Red lights flashed, flooding the apartment in crimson. 

I was struck with a deeply familiar fear, the same fear I had felt my first night here. It made my bones ache and my ears ring. 

Mey whipped her head around, her body tensing. She began to whine louder and louder, as if she were a dog howling along to ambulance sirens. Mateo immediately reached to cover her mouth with his hand, but after only a second he shouted in pain and pulled away, his fingers trickling blood. 

""Mey, it's okay!"" Gianna cried. I started towards her again, reaching out to take her in my arms, but I only made it a few steps before she charged at me. 

Mey tackled me to the ground, and I landed with a loud *THUD*. I reached for her wrists as she screamed and thrashed, but in her desperation, she overpowered me. I felt her fingernails dig into my face, scratching at me like a frightened animal, inching up toward my eyes. 

I screamed, trying to squirm away from her. Finally, Gianna and Mateo took her by either arm, hauling her off of me. I sat up, breathing heavy, and touched my face. It stung, and my fingertips came back stained red. 

Mey slumped over, still behind held up by her friends. I took a few last gulping breaths, just looking at her, trembling. Then I crawled forward, carefully wrapping my arms around her. 

She protested weakly, but not for long. After a moment she went completely limp, letting me hold her, sobbing wetly in my ear. I reached up, petting her hair, careful to avoid the spots where she had ripped it out. 

""It's okay,"" I whispered, squeezing my eyes shut so my tears couldn't fall. ""I'm sorry for leaving you. I was a coward. I'm so sorry."" 

I held her like that, cradling her, until the alarm finally stopped. The quiet that came after was almost more unbearable, making everything still. My head ached. 

""Will you stay the night?"" Mateo asked me finally, and he sat down beside us. Gianna followed suit. 

""Of course. Of course I will."" I sighed, opening my eyes to look at them. ""Can I stay with her?"" 

""I was hoping you would ask,"" Gianna said with a weak smile. ""We're exhausted. Would you mind if you stayed here, and Mateo and I slept over at his place?"" 

I shook my head. Gianna squeezed my shoulder. 

""Thanks, Arden. Really. Tomorrow we can think of something... but tonight I really just need some sleep."" 

Mateo nodded in agreement. I realized both of their eyes drooped with dark purple bags beneath them. 

""Yeah. Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll think of something."" 

\-- 

After we said our goodnights, I carefully put Mey in the bed. She was silent now, and still beside the shaking. 

I took a wet rag and very carefully cleaned up her face. When the blood was gone, I could almost recognize her again. I brushed her hair away from her face, staring into the place where her eyes had been. 

I still felt wary. It was hard to believe it was really her sitting in front of me... maybe it wasn't, none of us could know. Maybe she really had been transformed into some kind of creature. But in the chance that it was her, I wasn't going to let her sleep alone. Not again. 

I rested my forehead against hers, and she let me, drooling into her own lap. 

""I'm so sorry,"" I told her again. ""I should have stayed. I'm such a coward."" 

She opened her mouth and closed it again, like a fish. Like she wanted to say something, but she couldn't. I felt the tears coming again, and now I let them fall. 

When I finally drifted off to sleep, Mey pressed against my side still shaking, I dreamed of Will. I dreamed that he was outside, standing in front of the building, staring up at our window, his eyes wide and his jaw dropped open in a silent scream... but when I woke up and ran to the window, no one was there. 

\--

""Okay,"" I said, taking the cup of coffee Gianna handed me, smiling at her gratefully. ""I know what to do."" 

""After one night?"" Mateo asked, eyeing Mey warily. She was crouched over, tapping her head against the ground slowly in a rhythmic *thunk thunk thunk*. 

I shrugged. ""Do either of you have any ideas?"" 

They both shook their heads, glancing at each other. I took a sip of my coffee. 

""Hear me out, then."" 

Mey hit her head against the floor a little quicker, a little harder, letting out a low groan. ""Help me... help me..."" 

""I'll take her,"" I continued, reaching out to touch her shoulder. She flinched away from me as if I had burned her. ""I'll take her out there when the alarm starts, and I'll... I'll let them take me."" 

Mateo and Gianna both stared at me, their mouths open. I felt my stomach twist again, but this time not out of guilt. Out of fear. I pushed it down, not wanting to let it take over me again. 

""No, Arden, oh my god! You can't do that, they'll... they'll mutilate you, or kill you, or something!"" 

I shrugged again, avoiding their eyes. *Thunkthunkthunk*, Mey's head hit the floor. I  tried to gently pull her back. 

""I don't know what else there is to do. I want to *know*, don't you?"" 

Gianna shook her head quickly, crossing her arms. ""Not badly enough for that! Besides, if you do that we'll never know. You'll come back like... like..."" 

""Like Mey?"" 

Gianna glared at me, huffing. ""Yeah. Like Mey, or Will, or Shannon. Or you won't come back at all."" 

""But maybe... maybe there's a chance, maybe I could get them out of wherever they are. Like how you saved Mey."" 

*THUNKTHUNKTHUNKTHUNKTHUNK*. 

Mey slammed her head against the floor, hard enough to leave a bloody imprint. Mateo grabbed her and put her into a light headlock, restraining her. She screamed. ""HELP! HELP ME, SOMEONE, HELP! HELP, HELP, HELP, HELP, HELP..."" 

""We'll come with you,"" he grunted, raising his voice to be heard over her shouting, wincing from the effort it was taking to hold her still. 

""No, you can't, you-"" 

""We'll come with you,"" he repeated, looking at me pointedly. ""End of story."" 

""Yeah,"" Gianna chimed in, chewing on her bottom lip. ""Yeah, that's a good idea. At least that'll give us a better chance..."" 

I sighed, taking a slow sip of my coffee. I knew there was no point arguing with them, and to be completely honest, it was comforting to think of them coming with me. I felt like fainting thinking about doing something like that alone. 

""Fine,"" I muttered. ""Okay. Fine. We'll go tonight. Okay?"" 

There was silence for a moment, Mey's whines and pleas for help cutting through it every few seconds. 

""Yeah. We'll go tonight."" Gianna pushed some hair behind her ear, and I noticed her hand was shaking. ""Deal."" 

""And we'll bring them back."" 

""We'll bring them back,"" Mateo repeated, smiling like he didn't believe it for a second. 

\--

That was how we ended up in the street, the streetlights flashing a blinding red and the sirens wailing in our ears, ricocheting off every side of my skull and making it feel like my brain was shaking. Gianna held one of my hands and I held Mey's with the other. Mateo was on the other side of her, and together we kept her from attacking anyone or running away or both. 

I could see the people in the buildings watching us from their windows and from their doors, muttering things I couldn't hear to each other and shuffling around. I closed my eyes, not wanting the reality of what we were doing to set in and cause me to back out. 

Right when I started to think maybe nothing would happen, I heard it. Tires peeling around a corner, the screech of brakes, and the smell of exhaust. Gianna squeezed my hand, and I heard her whisper *oh God* under her breath. 

I opened my eyes to see four men climb out of the van. They were wearing blank masks, like ski masks but without any holes, so they could barely even be identified as human, and they had on strange white lab coats. They began to grab us, and Mey screamed and cried frantically, kicking at them as hard as she could as they lifted her off the ground. 

Gianna held my hand tightly until our fingers went cold and white, even as they tried to pry her away. I heard her crying, and even though this was our plan, I could tell she wanted desperately to fight them and run away as fast as she could. I was feeling the same way. 

Mateo barely even moved. He let them wrestle him into the van without saying a word, his face cold and still, his jaw tense. 

The last thing I remember is Gianna finally being pulled away from me, and my body being slammed down against what felt like a gurney. The van sped away alarmingly fast, and a man in another mask approached me, holding a syringe with a long, thick needle. 

""Wait, wait!"" I choked, holding out my hands, but it was too late. He plunged the needle into the side of my neck, and the world spun and dimmed into black. 

\-- 

When I opened my eyes, I was in a silent white room. 

I slowly looked around, my eyes struggling to adjust to the bright light. I looked down at myself, and found I was in a blue hospital gown, lying on top of some kind of stiff white bed. It took me a long moment to remember where I was, and why... but when I did, I nearly had to throw up. 

The room had no windows. It only had the bed, a small metal bedside table, and a door across the room that was the same color as everything else. The only way to identify it as a door was the round silver handle. In the upper right corner there was a small black camera. 

Carefully, I swung my legs over the side of the bed. I tested the ground, my knees nearly giving out... but after a moment, I was able to stand up. I shuffled over to the door. I didn't expect it to open, not at all. 

But it did. 

After one turn of the knob I was able to push it open, the door swinging open. I very nearly fell on my face, having not been prepared for it to move. 

The door opened to a long, carpeted hallway. It buzzed with life, people of all kinds wandering up and down and between rooms, all in hospital gowns, talking amongst themselves. I blinked, gazing around warily. A couple of kids sprinted past me, nearly tripping over themselves. I stumbled back, gripping the doorframe for support. 

""Arden!"" Someone shouted from down the hall, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. I turned, and I gasped. 

There stood my friends - Gianna and Mateo were there, as well as another girl with strawberry blonde hair, smiling ear to ear, and between them... 

""*Will?!*"" 

He grinned at me. I instantly forgot about the weakness in my legs, stumbling towards them like a baby deer learning to walk. 

""Hey, Arden,"" he said when I was closer, still smiling wide. He wrapped an arm around me, the other one wrapped around the other girl, and gave me a squeeze. 

I pulled away after a second, looking him up and down. No blood, seemingly no injuries at all... he seemed perfectly untouched. I squinted at him in suspicion. 

""What the hell is going on?"" 

He shrugged his shoulders, looking around as if he were seeing it for the first time too. ""After I went after Shannon, they brought me here... I was locked in one of those rooms for who knows how long. They gave me food and books to read, but not much else. This is the first time the doors have been open..."" 

""Does that mean..."" my voice faded away. He nodded, confirming what I hadn't asked. 

All of the people around me had been victims. Some of them I could even recognize... I swore one of the old men standing next to a wall, speaking to a woman, was that man I had seen that first night. The one who had looked right back at me and screamed, so bloodcurdlingly that I still had nightmares about it. I shivered. 

""Wait,"" I whispered, something occurring to me. ""Does *that* mean that-""

Someone tapped my shoulder. I turned slowly, afraid to look. 

Mey stood in front of me, her hands clasped behind her back, a shy smile on her face. She was like a snapshot of that first day, the day I had met her. She fluttered her eyelashes at me, her eyes slightly watery. She was *completely fine*. 

A strange groan of relief left my throat, and I enveloped her in my arms, lifting her off the ground and spinning her around. She squealed, laughing and grabbing at my shoulders. As soon as I set her down again she kissed me, wrapping her arms around my neck. 

""I missed you so much,"" she whispered, resting her forehead against mine. 

*Resting her forehead against mine*... 

I suddenly remembered two nights ago, doing this very thing with a version of her that had no eyes and could only use her voice to beg for help. I bit my lip, frowning. 

""This makes no sense..."" 

""I know,"" Gianna said, matching my expression. ""I don't understand at all. How could you all be completely fine if we *saw* you? Who... who did we rescue if it wasn't actually Mey?""

A voice came over some kind of intercom, crackling to life. Everyone in that hallway froze, turning their heads to the ceiling. Mey took my hand and squeezed it, and I let her. 

""*CONGRATULATIONS*,"" the voice buzzed, so low and unnatural that it had to be altered somehow for anonymity. ""*THE TEST HAS BEEN PASSED. THE BYSTANDER EXPERIMENT IS COMPLETE. YOU ARE ALL FREE TO LEAVE, AS SOON AS YOU SIGN YOUR PAPERWORK. THANK YOU*."" 

The intercom crackled into silence. The air was heavy, and no one said anything for a long moment. Then, someone began to cheer, then another, then another. Soon cheering was all I could hear, bouncing off the walls, the energy electric all around me. 

My friends hugged me, and I hugged them back, nearly sobbing in relief. It finally felt like that first night again, just sitting and smoking and laughing with them, grateful to have friends... before I knew anything about our neighborhood. Before I believed them about it. 

As we began to file toward the exits, my friends bickering about something meaningless, their faces still glowing with wide smiles, I began to feel uneasy. 

I couldn't stop thinking about the girl I had thought was Mey. I had my suspicions, but deep down I had truly believed it was her... 

My head whipped to the right as I heard a scratching sound, somehow reaching me over the sounds of all the people in the hallway. I stared at the door it had come from, its only discerning feature being the metal doorknob. 

I looked around. My friends didn't seem to even notice I had stopped, still chatting and laughing uproariously. I slipped away from the crowd, my hand shaking as I reached for the knob. 

The door slowly creaked open. The room was dim, and the stench of blood and excrement immediately punched me in the nose. My eyes stung. I blinked through it, squinting. 

In the corner of the room something was hunched over, and I could hear soft gasps and sobs. 

""H-Help... help me... please..."" 

Its body was somehow bony and globular at the same time, both wrinkled and decrepit and smooth and youthful. It was impossible to describe. 

It was a mass, an amalgamation, a monster. 

It turned its head to look at me, and I looked back into a thousand faces all at once. I looked back at blood, and broken bones, and teeth, and pain. 

I looked back at the old man with the missing arms, and the children who squawked like chickens, and Shannon with her missing eyes. I looked back at Will.  

I looked back at Mey. 

""Help me..."" 

I want to believe what I saw in that room was the real monster: it was whatever we saw each night, taking the forms of our loved ones, and they were all safe in that building the entire time. I want to believe it's maybe something artificial, something made specifically for the purpose of their experiment. 

I don't want to believe that what I saw *was* all of them, somehow cosmically smashed together, crammed into the same disgusting figure. Able to mold itself into anybody it contains. A tortured slave to whatever government force did all of this. 

I don't want to believe Mey is in there. Still blind. Still suffering. 

But I just don't know.

1hd058o,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hd058o/not_the_real_you/,Not the real you,"This is the worst part of my day now.  I'll go to where I always go at this time, knowing, I might see you there.  Knowing that it is now so different.  Knowing you wont talk to me, look at me, or even acknowledge that I exist.  I know you have to do it, its the only path forward, I get it.   

I hate it though.  Knowing how things were, not knowing how you still feel.  Sitting, wondering, waiting, hoping that you might reach out and tell me something. . . anything.  Knowing that the joy has been stripped from you and that I'm the reason.  Knowing I cant fix it.   Stuck in my own head, all day, all alone, wishing you were still here.   Driving by places we've been together, remembering the times spent at restaurants, coffee shops, and stops signs where you were so distracted you went the wrong way. 

God how I wish things were different, how I wish you were still with me.  Even today when I had to go somewhere unexpectedly, my first thought was you wouldn't have let it get this far.  You would have been on top of it, we would have handled it already.   I cant tell you how many people say I can see why you were so good at this, how things were better when you were here.  I'm constantly reminded of your absence, how great you are, how bad I am without you.  

I'll still go, maybe even see you there, but it isn't the version of you that I knew.  I'll go because it's my last remaining connection to you, and I'm so stuck on you that even this is better than nothing at all.  I'll still see you, even if you don't see me, I'll still love you.  

I sure made a mess of this, I still don't know how to fix it all.  I know you need to do what's best for you right now.

Here's what I learned along the way (5 mistakes),"I’m thrilled to announce the release of my first game, **Conradito Cafézito**, on Steam! After **7 months of hard work**, I’ve learned a ton, made some mistakes, and gained invaluable experience. I want to share my journey with you — both to inspire and to spark discussion about game development methods.

# About the game

Conradito Cafézito is an **idle incremental game** themed around coffee. Players unlock ingredients, buy recipes, brew coffee, hire employees, and generate passive income with franchises. On top of that, I added several “unique” features to make the game more creative, including:

* **Minigames** to pass the time and earn rewards;
* **Random events** (both good and bad) that occur during gameplay;
* Various systems to boost income and expand operations.

The idea started as a simple classroom experiment, inspired by clicker games like *Cookie Clicker*. Over time, the coffee theme took shape, and the employee mechanics became a key feature. That’s when I decided to fully commit to finishing the project and releasing it as my first official game.

**📚 Lessons learned**

# 1. My biggest regret: Not creating a full GDD 📃

Ah, the infamous Game Design Document (GDD). I knew it was important, but I resisted making one. What I did have was so basic it barely covered 30% of the game’s content.

As a result, I kept adding new features EVERY DAY — mechanics, systems, menus, upgrades, you name it. This caused countless issues with overlapping systems and forced me to rewrite large parts of the code multiple times.

**Lesson learned:** Having a detailed GDD from the start could’ve reduced my development time from 7 months to just 2–3 months. For my next game, I’ve already written an [82-page GDD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NzQXhbRSqKyU287d2FhWnmfgrZBc_04QRJvMBvQNofw/edit?usp=sharing) (and counting)!

# 2. I delayed creating my Steam page 💸

I didn’t create my Steam page until October, with the launch planned for December. I waited until the game was almost finished to start working on the page and marketing. Big mistake.

Your Steam page should be live as soon as you have basic content and visuals to showcase. The earlier you do this, the more time you have to grow your wishlist and build momentum for launch. Plus, as a first-timer, I spent hours watching tutorials just to figure out how everything worked.

**Lesson learned:** Create your Steam page early in the development process.

# 3. I procrastinated on the save system 💾

I put off implementing the save system, thinking it would be straightforward. Spoiler: it wasn’t. This ended up being the most challenging part of the project.

I had to completely reorganize class structures, variables, and encapsulations to integrate saving and loading properly. Even now, every time I launch the game, I cross my fingers hoping nothing breaks (embarrassing, I know).

**Lesson learned:** Plan and implement the save system from the very beginning.

# 4. I underestimated the importance of localization 🌍

This mistake had two parts:

1. I didn’t set up a **localization system early on**. By the time I started translating, the game already had tons of hardcoded text. I ended up using a `strings.xml` file, but I should’ve explored Unity plugins or more efficient methods.
2. I chose a font that didn’t support non-Latin scripts. When I decided to translate the game into Chinese, Japanese, and Russian (huge markets!), I had to deal with the headache of adapting the font.

**Lesson learned:** Plan for localization and font compatibility **from day one**.

# 5. What’s next? 🍃

The launch is just the beginning. I’m still learning how to handle post-launch: engaging with the community, creating content updates, and keeping the game relevant over time. Maybe in a few months, I’ll come back to share what I’ve learned about that.

I’ve been a programmer for 10 years, mainly working on apps and web development. Two years ago, I dove into game development. While I’ve made smaller projects to learn, releasing a game commercially was a completely different experience — the level of polish and attention to detail required is on another level.

I hope my experience inspires other developers, and I’d love to hear from anyone who has gone through this process.

**Wishing luck and success to all game devs out there!** 🎮

* Rug colours
* Coffee table ideas
* How to take advantage of the high ceilings/windows as a renter
* Dramatic decor on a budget
* Any ideas for the overall style/decor

But could use some work no doubt.. I had never even really thought about constipation until day 2 in Mexico, I realized I didn’t have a bm for a couple days, not out of discomfort, but just because I have a pretty routine schedule. After about a 15 minute google session I tried stretching, massaging, etc etc etc. and although for some people it might work, I only found it made me more uncomfortable. So, I told myself if I didn’t have a bm the next morning on an empty stomach with coffee I’d go get laxatives. Long story short I didn’t…Mexican Senokot it was, took that for the next 4 days with little result, enough bm to feel like I wasn’t exploding, but I believe it’s what people refer to as overflow, so basically just what the body can get by whatever the large mass is. Anyways, after getting home I tried out Magnesium citrulate powder. 300mg, nothing, 300mg more that night, still nothing. At this point my options are low and I’m super uncomfortable. I just wanna sh*t. So I had to pick between a fleets and dulcolax, no brainer for me. I took one 5mg tablet (this is all while drinking so much water I was taking a leak every 45 mins) and eating an extremely green diet, tons and tons of roughage and fruit. And it worked within 2-3 hrs and it was pretty good relief, I’m typing this 24hrs later after taking no more laxatives and just eating a solid breakfast and lunch, and I’ve had another good bm. I would take caution in whatever you choose? But I now know how awful this feels, so I’m sharing my story to help or calm you guys on your own journey. Ps: I’m an extremely stressed out dude, from what I’ve heard stress just about can mess up any function in the body, so if you’re in a scenario like me just try and remember how many thousands of people have dealt with this, and there are a ton of options that can/will work. I wouldn’t even go to a doctor/er until you’ve exhausted all of your options from home, or have lost gas movement/sensation to go to bathroom. DRINK WATER!",1,1734050343.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

Thorn bush: She hits every tile above and below her in a column. She hits periodically. 150 sun.

Shroodoo: When a zombie takes damage, every zombie around Shroodoo also takes damage. 100 sun (needs coffee bean for day).

Rooterect: makes projectiles that hit it go into adjacent lanes. You can toggle him for the top lane or bottom lane, however, you can't use the middle lane when he's planted. 125 sun.

Tactical Cuke: Destroys everything on the lawn, including plants. You can protect lanes of plants using stuff like Wallnuts. 300 sun.

Winter cabbage: Lobs frozen cabbage that slows down zombies. The cabbage also hits zombies in a 1x3 radius. 200 sun.

Brussel scout: The puffshroom equivalent of Peashooter. Shoots half the distance of a lane. 50 sun.

Lemon-ade: Explodes like a Cherrybomb, but leaves a 3x3 puddle of acid that damages zombies until it goes away after some time. 200 sun.

Shineapple: Produces sun when damaged, and has the same health as a Wallnut. The amount of sun is like Sunbean's amount. Can be used with Aloe. 125 sun.

Treebuchet: once toggled, lobs pinecones at any zombie you select, and recharges extremely fast unlike Cobbcanon/BananaLauncher. 175 sun but gets more expensive.

Ragweed: A rework of pvz3's. Now an instant plant, when used it makes a zombie sick and take damage over time. The infected zombie spreads the sickness to other zombies in the lane. 100 sun.

Mapple drone: Spawns a drone that automatically hits the nearest zombie anywhere. The drone is basically a Peashooter and can't take damage. 250 sun but gets more expensive.

A moment I'm not sure I was ready for, yet wanted with all my soul. I'm not sure if it happened while I planned my own Thanksgiving, or maybe while I vowed to never bake your favorite things anymore. I don't know if it was while I sat laughing with new found friends or while I forced myself to be determined. 

Perhaps it was while I made my own coffee and it tasted new, but perfect. Maybe that was it. Or while I suddenly didn't want to hear our ""song"" I love Raliegh, but I won't die there, free. My heart knows that. I have a new city that knows my foot steps. Perhaps that's was when it happened. During my moments of exploring alley ways and new rose gardens. Maybe the old cemeteries that are filled with dead dreams and love parted. I think of the many tears poured on that soil, but none of the tears belong to me anymore. 

It could have been a random Wednesday on my lunch break and I sat laughing on the phone with my favorite family member.  I didn't even think about your voice on the other end. Or wishing that it was. I had funny things to share with her. It didn't occur to me that normally they would be shared with you. 

I'm not sure when it happened and I'm not even sure how long ago it was. I can't remember the very second or the moment the space between us no longer was a thought. It just didn't anymore. Didn't hurt. 

For some reason this brings an unfamiliar feeling. A feeling that I didn't expect. Wishing. Not as I used to, but wishing I remembered when I finally let go. 

Did the universe shake for a moment? Was there some indication in the vast universe that a single string was broken? As deep as my love was, one would think the sky itself would fall from such a monumental moment. 

But it didn't.

1hczxf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caffeine_Use/comments/1hczxf3/almost_quit_caffeine_but_then_i_turned_back_and/,"Almost quit, caffeine, but then I turned back and I’m glad.","so until I was 28 years old, I'd  been a daily caffeine(coffee and energy drinks) user and absolutely loved it. it never really helped me focus. Or get motivated to do work, but it helped me get out of bed in the morning and would lift my chronic fatigue that was making me feel like my head was wrapped in cotton wall all the time.
Unfortunately, in 2023 I went through a serious episode of undiagnosed depression/anhedonia during which caffeine began to feel extremely horrible. It stopped making me feel good, whilst negative symptoms like anxiety and jitters became very prominent whereas I had never felt them before. yet I still continued caffeine to avoid withdrawal. it led me to develop a plan in the back of my mind to stop caffeine completely. for the month of Ramadan which I always do to avoid sleep disturbances, but then never to go back to it after Ramadan is over.
I later discovered that the depressive episode I went through and the way it changed caffeine for me had led me to incorrectly assume that caffeine caused my depression and it became the target of my anger.
But then God blessed me with the visit of a relative who was a chef and only eight very healthy food, resulting in all our daily meals, becoming much higher in protein and leafy green vegetables and going most days without added sugar. that, along with positive changes at work. resolved my depression/ anhedonia and caffeine began to slowly work wonderfully again, although the process took about six months to reach its peak and it took another few months for the height and sensitivity to negative symptoms to disappear completely.
When it came to Ramadan of 2024, I quit caffeine as usual and although I did not want to quit it for good, I refrained from going back to it for a few days after Ramadan ended just to see how I felt when eating normally but without caffeine.
Honestly, it was absolutely terrible. I had terrible brain fog and felt like there was A blanket wrapped around my head. well, not literally but I think you get the idea.
This was in contrast to all that I have heard in online articles and blog posts about how peoples lives were miraculously changed by giving up caffeine for a month. yes, I know some people say it takes longer than that, but in previous years I have unintentionally quit caffeine for over a year. and I really didn't see any improvement in my life.
I'm not saying that those people have made it up or that their experiences are less valid than mine, just that my journey taught me that caffeine is right for me and hopefully always will be.
Caffeine is one of those things that I think is imprinted into my spirit and will be one of my companions leaving me only when I die.

From the enviable booth at the rear corner of Dee’s Diner—in all its antique, wood-stained glory, and the disembodied bison head, named Chip, staring down at him from its mount behind the coffee station—Mickey Verona, Esq., sipped his incredibly rich coffee and watched as Dr. Smith entered the vestibule disheveled, brushing snow off his tweed coat and unwrapping his scarf.

This was why his spot at Dee’s was the best office in the Flathead Valley. Eventually, everyone came into the diner, so if you stayed long enough you got to watch them. As a student of human nature and an armchair anthropologist, this position suited Mickey well.

The half-moon booth butted against the southwest corner, facing the door; its leather was soft, worn into the exact dimensions of his ass. If he needed a break from all the lawyerly bullshit, he could gaze out at the cradle of a valley formed by the friendly Salish Mountains to the west and the majestic Missions to the east. These two ranges held in their arms the great Flathead Lake—the largest natural body of freshwater west of the Mississippi. It was a moody, aqueous gem that turned, on some days, cobalt, at evening, amethyst, or, as it was now, beneath the snowfall, a granite tombstone. And like all great bodies of water, a folkloric cryptid—portrayed as an orca on postcards—dubbed the Flathead Monster lurked elusively within its volume.

Dee’s food was delicious, and the coffee was strong and always hot. But what kept him coming back for more, day after day for the last five years, was the waitress. Foxy Prewwett, with two Ws for *Wow Wham!* And two Ts for *Tits* and *Tush.*

Five years he had fantasized about popping the pearly buttons of her uniform to free those full, firm milk melons. He imagined the softest, pinkest areolas studded with hard yet tender nipples. And what the hell would he do with her if he could ever—ever in a million years!—grow the cojones to ask her out? Oh, he’d come close a few times, but had always ended up entangled in the wreckage of his own words.

Today, however, was going to be different. It had happened the moment Comstock began shouting at that boy in the interrogation room. Something in his head had popped, a pressure that had been building for years, and in that second, he’d made up his mind that the world needed more love than hate, and that each individual had to do their own part. For Mickey Verona, today was the day. Besides, he wouldn’t be able to look at himself in the mirror if he had to go stag, yet again, to the Lake County Halloween Gala.

“Over here, Doc.” Mickey waved.

Dr. Smith navigated between the tables, bumping the backs of two occupied chairs on the way, oblivious to the sharp looks from their annoyed occupants, to arrive and seat himself across from Mickey.

“Your office?” he asked.

“Best seat in town. Let’s munch and work. I got a few ideas for a defense strategy.” He pushed a menu across the table. “I know it’s lunchtime, but I suggest the Lumberjack Stack. Hot cakes are so fluffy you’d think you were eating a cloud.”

“I’m okay.” Smith pushed the menu aside. “Let’s get to work.”

“Suit yourself, Doc. More for me.”

“Alan,” said the shrink bluntly.

Mickey guessed the man had crested the hill of middle age with as much grace as he walked through restaurants. His brown hair salted with gray, and a few days’ growth of facial hair threatening to bloom into a beard if left unchecked, helped him look the part of his profession.

The aloof stereotype of a shrink would have been his first guess as to the man’s career. Yet, there was a fire in him now that he’d been looking for but hadn’t found back at the jail. Only… he couldn’t discern whether it was a fire of passion or something else. There were a lot of hurting people these days. Perhaps he was a vet and had put his time in fighting FEEN—a fate Mickey was lucky to avoid due to bad genetics and the influence of his father’s doctor: flat feet. Hell, for all he knew, the guy across from him could be on the spin right now. Escape drugs were getting better every year: more addictive, more subtle, more deadly. At the very least, there was a puffy weariness around his eyes that suggested he didn’t sleep well. Was he a drinker?

“Hair of the dog that bit ya?” Mickey ventured. “Foxy stirs a beautiful Bloody Mary.”

“Just coffee, thanks,” said Alan.

Yep, a drinker. Poor guy. In his work, Mickey had met a lot of shrinks. It wasn’t uncommon for them to find a crutch for their depressing careers in either bottle or barbiturate.

“Hey, Mickey, who’s your new friend?” asked the pretty blonde woman holding an order pad.

“Hey there, Foxy. This is Dr. Smith, head shrink extraordinaire. But just call him Alan. He doesn’t like titles. So, toots, you have anything you wanna get off your chest?”

Foxy looked down with long, purple eyelashes at her ample bosom straining against her waitress smock.

“I don’t think so,” she replied, smacking her strawberry-scented bubble gum and straightening the yellow ribbon pin on her lapel, just above the firm slope of her cleavage.

If the boys on the Eastern Front knew they had this depth of warm support back home, it’d stiffen their resolve against FEEN through those long, hard, lonely winter nights.

“You sure? Looks like you do.” Mickey let her catch his wink to Smith.

“Oh, Mickey, you’re so bad!” She smacked him on the shoulder with her order book. “So, what can I get you fellas today, huh?” Foxy was no broad, but she played the part to a T.

“Numero uno, a pot of fresh coffee, and I’ll take the Lumberjack Stack, side of bacon—make them black—and eggs, you know how I like them.”

Foxy giggled. “Sunny side up,” they said in unison.

“And you, doctor, er, Alan?”

“Just coffee, please,” said Alan.

“Oh, cat got your appetite?”

“He’s had a hell of a morning, darling,” said Mickey.

“Okay, I’ll be right back.”

She strutted off to place the order with the kitchen, her shapely hips swaying seductively from side to side with the rhythm of her rump.

Mickey whistled and peeled his lustful gaze away. Alan stared at him narrowly, so he reluctantly dawned his professional façade.

“The way I see it,” said Mickey, “we have certain cards in our hand and need to play them very carefully. There will be an arraignment on Monday in front of Judge Myers. Francis will appear virtually. He’ll plead not guilty, of course. Because of our unfortunate luck in winning the John Taylor lotto, Myers has asked for an emergency calendar session tomorrow morning. We’ll know more about what the prosecution has up its sleeve at that time. In short, this isn’t gonna be over next week.”

“I guess Taylor has an election to win,” said Alan.

“I think what we need is time on this, so maybe a few weeks isn’t a bad thing.”

“Can we get Francis out of there?”

“We’ll try. I’ll make a motion to have him moved to a juvenile facility, but don’t hold your breath. 8 AM. Don’t be late. And don’t wear a red tie. Judge Myers is a confirmed Democrat.”

“I don’t own a tie,” said Alan.

“Even better. Makes you look more relatable.”

“I am relatable,” said Alan.

“Sure you are. My first move will be to try and get the case thrown out on lack of evidence. They don’t have much to go on.”

“CCTV?” asked Alan.

“What appears to be a hug,” said Mickey.

“That’s it?”

“It’s hard to make out. The camera had a glitch.”

“Figures.”

Mickey added, “There’s the play of witness bias. The Winesworth boy’s father is in the High Mountain Rangers, and Mx. Dale, well, *shi*-with-an-*i* has filed complaints against male students three times in as many years.”

“Open and shut then.”

“Not really. Like I said, John Taylor’s daughter has obviously experienced some form of trauma, enough that she’s still mute. You know anything that could cause that?”

Alan shrugged. “If trauma is severe enough it can cause people to stop talking. It’s called psychogenic aphonia. I’ve seen it in soldiers. It’s usually temporary. But I don’t think Francis could have done anything to her in the few minutes they had before class started.”

“Let’s hope she finds her tongue soon. Comstock wasn’t bluffing. You should prepare yourself for the prosecution to elevate this to a sexual offense. It plays better with the jury.”

“Bullshit. This is all bullshit,” said Alan.

“The system knows that,” replied Mickey.

“Our cards aren’t looking so strong.”

“We’ve got to make them strong. It would be nice to have a couple of character witnesses who can attest that Francis is a good boy. Teachers. A friend, preferably White, preferably female. But at this point we’ll take anyone. Maybe his guardian since his folks seem to be out of the picture. Look, I’m going to be filing paperwork all day. Can you drop by where he lives, see if someone can say something on his behalf?”

“I can do that. What if the judge doesn’t dismiss the case?”

Mickey sighed. There was a better chance of getting a tiger-blood snow cone in Hell. But he wouldn’t tell the shrink that. He knew these types of cases. It was important to keep rays of hope, even if they were false.

He looked out the window at the flurries. *Here it comes. The trick knee always wins.*

“You heard him today… magic, hocus-pocus. I think we have a strong case for mental incompetence. He won’t be able to stand trial. That is an option.”

Alan’s hands balled into fists on the tabletop. “I don’t think Francis is crazy. That’ll tarnish his record forever. It’s important we don’t go down that path. Claiming something like that has a way of turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy.”

“Alan,” Mickey used his well-oiled, courtroom voice, “Hunters who? The magic what? He’s psychically leading her where? Down the Yellow Brick Road? That shit is now in the fucking record.”

Alan turned to watch the flakes. Eyes locked on the rough surface of the lake he said, “He’s been abused. He’s got scars all over his body.”

“Christ,” whispered Mickey. “Listen, we’re not gonna mention that fact tomorrow unless we have to. This prosecutor, I know her work. She believes in the doctrine that the abused become the abusers.”

“That’s not where the literature is. It’s a gross oversimplification,” objected Alan.

“Hah! The literature? Welcome to reality, Doc. This is crime and punishment. Entertainment for the masses. The ‘No Touch’ Policy. They wanted that.” He gestured broadly to the smattering of customers throughout the diner. “We have only ourselves to thank. I know it sounds callous, but in today’s world, being officially classified as insane is a hell of a lot better than having ‘sex offender’ printed on your license plates.”

“Fuck, he’s too young,” said Alan. “This is going to destroy him.”

“Welcome to reality, Doc. Nothing is a secret these days. Look,” Mickey pushed his phone across the table. On the screen was a headline from one of the local newspapers: TEEN SEXUALLY ATTACKS CLASSMATE AND TEACHER.

Alan read the caption aloud: *“Names are being withheld because the victim and perpetrator are underage, but sources say a male juvenile was taken into custody on overwhelming evidence and the testimony of several witnesses.”*

“Shit,” said Alan.

“Not just shit,” said Mickey, “a good old fashioned Montana winter shit storm.”",0,1734049954.0,HFY,2,0.5,False

1hczshx,https://www.reddit.com/r/McKinsey_BCG_Bain/comments/1hczshx/big_law_ma_to_big_3/,Big Law M&A to Big 3,"Hey, y’all—been thinking about the jump to MBB from the law for a while now, so wanted to get some of your thoughts/guidance. Apologies in advance if this isn’t the right forum for this question.

For some background: 

In college, I had admittedly terrible grades so I never got the opportunity to interview for banking/consulting like a lot of my friends. After college though, I killed the LSAT, was able to get into a top law school, where I got good grades, and then ended up in M&A big law at a good firm. 

After a couple years in big law, however, I’m starting to get the feeling that the law may not be for me longterm. I love working on deals, but I think working on deals from another, more quantitative perspective would suit me more. 

While I’m ignorant of this industry, I think I could be a somewhat compelling candidate—good communicator, client-facing from early on in my legal career, etc. 

With that context provided, here are my questions to y’all: 

1. What’s the likelihood of a candidate with my profile making the pivot? 

2. Could you recommend me any good resources for learning more about your industry, in particular any good interviewing/recruiting/etc. guides? 

3. Is there anything else that you think might be good to know from my perspective? 

Finally, if anyone is down to talk with me about any of this, I’d be more than happy to send an e-Starbucks gift card or something to make it like a virtual coffee chat.

I’ve been in business a total of 2.5 years, of which a little over 1 year having served as an advisor.

I’m fairly young, having just turned 25–I have some good relationships with other senior advisors in the area at different firms, but I’d like to create my own practice, given my long runway. I had coffee again this morning with an Edward Jones advisor who’s about 5-7 years in, and has found success—he reiterated the power of door knocking during his early years.

-Has anyone done this consistently?
-What has the success rate been like?
-What are best practices? Just a name tag and a card? Pamphlet? Park in one place and canvas the whole neighborhood? Etc
-What other forms of prospecting have been successful?

Prospecting is obviously the million dollar question… I am a part of BNI, and utilize LinkedIn — and will soon be regularly hosting education-only seminars.

We had to completely undress my toddler, and she gave us a Basta tshirt to cover her up with. Then when my daughter was upset and still shaken, Ashely brought a stuffed gingerbread man out for her.

I couldn't believe for a city (probably all of Japan but I haven't been anywhere else for too long to notice) with such a deeply ingrained cycling culture, it doesn't know how to set up or care for their bikes.

I think at least half the bikes I see are running completely flat, and I haven't yet seen one biker with their saddle height set correctly, not even the two roadies I've seen.  Most people have their saddle set so low, you could balance a cup of coffee on their thighs.

Spotting bikes with flat tires has become my new obsession here since I got bored with looking for pylons in stupid places.

On a side note, I got a rental e-bike here, and trying to go at full speed, it is still slower than my 40 pound hard tail I have back home.  But it's only $1.20 CAD for 30 minutes, so it's hard to complain about.",0,1734048774.0,bicycling,19,0.38,False

- leather brown, greens, yellow and oranges pulled from the couch using throw blankets and pillows.

In early 2020, my relationship with Raneem, my younger sister, became strained as her behavior turned erratic and harmful. She began invading my privacy, stealing belongings, and damaging my property, including cutting my jeans and blaming me for her actions. Despite installing a lock on my door, I trusted her with the code, only to realize she was the source of the problem.  
During COVID, Raneem sabotaged the dessert business I started with my sister Hadeel by destroying desserts before delivery. This forced us to shut down the business, not just impacting our income but shattering something I was proud of. The nightly fights at home became unbearable, and our parents refused to hold Raneem accountable. Ultimately, Hadeel and I were kicked out of the house, leaving me deeply hurt and unsupported.

**Part 2: Escaping to Turkey (2021)**  
In 2021, I fled to Turkey for five months to escape the chaos at home. However, my time there was marred by trauma, including near-rape attempts, a $2,000 robbery by a supposed friend, and emotional betrayal. Back home, Raneem continued her destructive behavior, cutting the cord of an expensive coffee machine and breaking Hadeel’s laptop.  
One harrowing moment occurred when my father had a medical emergency, and my family stood idly by for five minutes without calling for help. Hadeel and I took action, but the incident underscored their indifference and left me deeply unsettled.

**Part 3: Continued Abuse and Breaking Points (2022-2023)**  
Raneem’s harassment escalated in 2022, with theft, physical violence, and relentless disruption. My relationship with Hadeel also deteriorated due to financial strain and emotional neglect. She wasted my money, ruined my clothes with bleach, and showed little appreciation for my efforts to maintain the household. 

however end of 2022, we became close to our cousins. after years of not really talking. this was the start of us seeing each other again. we are about 15 cousins total. 

  
2023, things were great, all our cousins saw each other regularly, we were so close. I should note however I was the one everyone relied on while giving little in return. I cooked every meal, cleaned up after everyone, and hosted all gatherings at my house. Despite everyone else having cars, I was the exclusive driver, paying for gas and covering food expenses. These contributions drained my finances, energy, and emotional well-being.  


**Part 4: Isolation and Betrayal (2023-2024)**  
In the summer of 2024, a cottage trip with my cousins and sisters turned sour. I handled all the cooking and planning for nine people, only to be met with ingratitude and selfishness. Hadeel’s tantrum during the Garden Party I meticulously planned was the final straw, leaving me feeling disrespected and unappreciated.

In October 2024, Raneem attacked me, leaving cuts on my neck. Seeking support, I called my cousin Noor whom I am closest too, who initially listened but soon questioned my account, leaving me feeling gaslit and invalidated. Her refusal to condemn Raneem despite knowing my suffering felt like a betrayal.

Raneem’s birthday celebration in November 2024 highlighted the family’s alignment with her despite years of abuse. My cousins and Hadeel defended her, disregarding my pain. Hadeel further isolated me by hosting gatherings at her house, deliberately excluding me.  


**Part 5: The Breaking Point (October-November 2024)**  
In October 2024, Raneem’s violence escalated, marking me physically and emotionally. My family’s refusal to acknowledge her cruelty left me feeling utterly alone. By November, Hadeel continued hosting gatherings with my cousins while excluding me, deepening my isolation.  
The realization that my family and cousins would not stand by me—despite everything I’ve endured—has left me heartbroken. Their choice to remain close to Raneem feels like a complete betrayal. I can no longer sacrifice my well-being for relationships that disregard my suffering.

**Reflection**  
I’ve reached my breaking point. Years of abuse, sacrifice, and betrayal have taken their toll. If my family and cousins continue to align with Raneem, I must walk away to protect my peace and survive. This heartbreak runs deep, but I know I deserve more than to be surrounded by people who ignore my pain. 

  
I should note Even with all I did, my efforts were overlooked and unappreciated. When conflicts arose, I was painted as the problem. My sacrifices—financial, emotional, and physical—were ignored, while others reaped the benefits without gratitude. like I did everything for everyone and you couldn't stand by me not even a little? its crazy because its like they all forgot the things I did. even when I would try to push for a hangout at someone else house, everyone would have an excess or for someone else to drive. 

its been about a month since this happened and am devastated. i'm in very intensive therapy, I haven't seen or spoken to my cousins or sister in a month. they haven't reached out or anything, I deeply miss my cousin, but I have so much rage. she is spineless and doesn't care what happened because she thinks she is taking a mature standpoint and avoiding the conflict, she has a tendency to only see someone as a bad person if they are directly effecting her.  which is driving me insane, how can you only think someone is horrible only when you are effected. thats like if someone was rude to a waiter bit not to you? dont you think you would see them differently? life has been so tough man. im looking for some advice I guess. I unfortunately live at home and moving out is not an option, I cannot afford it. I just graudetd undergrad. im applying to masters, I cannot afford rent in my country. I am in a relationship, we will not move out together, out goal is to eventually live at home, and then one day buy a house, we don't want to live together and waste money on rent. and no I dont want to move to a third world country as a solution.  I am trying to make new friends now to help build a support system, so I can sometimes leave my house and escape and see people. Unfortunately my family was largely part of my social circle.   

  
It feels like my cousins always need a common enemy to unite against, and now that target is me. Previously, it was another cousin who chose to keep their distance, but now they’ve shifted their focus to me. It’s like they’re bonding over their shared dislike of me, and they seem to genuinely enjoy hating on me.

At the same time, my brother and sister are making my life increasingly difficult. Any time I try to speak up about their actions, it’s twisted to make it seem like I’m the one causing problems, rather than their behavior being the real issue. No one is willing to stand by me or acknowledge the harm they’re causing. By allowing this dynamic to continue, everyone is enabling their actions.

My parents don’t care enough to intervene or stand up for me—they never do. This has forced me to become extremely hyper-independent in every area of my life, except for where I live. It’s exhausting to carry so much responsibility while constantly being undermined and unsupported by those around me.",1,1734048413.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False
1hczc9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/RezzyCheck/comments/1hczc9g/advice_always_have_a_friend_or_family_member/,ADVICE: Always have a friend or family member proofread your resume,"Sometimes we spend so much time editing and reviewing our own resume, we fail to see obvious errors.

**Why does this happen?**

* Our brains tend to ""fill in the gaps"" and automatically correct perceived errors, essentially skipping over actual mistakes due to the familiarity with the material.

**How do I prevent this?**

* Take periodic breaks from reviewing & editing your resume. Give your brain a chance to clear its cache.
* Try reading it in different settings, like outside, at a coffee shop, on physically printed paper.
* Have a friend or family member read it and ask for feedback.

**Doesn't spellcheck take care of everything?**

* Not all errors are spelling-related! Alignment, spacing, consistency, grammar, visual appeal (white space, etc.) and flow are all things that can be missed by self-review.

**What else you got, Cam?**

* Using ChatGPT is a good way to catch any obvious mistakes, but remember, your resume will ultimately be reviewed by a human hiring manager. Use AI as a form of proofreading, not as the final product!

A fellow Masshole baptized me with a Dunks coffee spiked off my windshield this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1gf134j/it_took_nearly_40_years_but_it_finally_happened_a/).

I remember it like was yesterday. This wonderfully, beautifully, angry man in a small blue Toyota Yaris took exception to multiple cars honking at him for blocking a left turn lane and decided I would be the beneficiary of his glorious rage. 

I obviously never expected to see him again, what would be the chances?

This happened as you may recall, crossing from Everett into Chelsea, as I was heading to work in East Boston. A key detail is I street park often on a street which is very much not gentrified and very much long-time EB residents. A few days after the baptism I saw a small, blue Toyota Yaris parked on the same block and had a little chuckle to myself... what if? But no way. Right?

I've it seen a few more times over the past weeks, and each time the details have stuck out a little more. The creative body tape work holding on the front bumper, the other dings and dents, the stickers.... what if? But still, no way right?

But today, I saw him. I came back from lunch and pulled up to park and saw him with his driver's side window down talking to another resident. It was him. All that was missing was him screaming what I am sure were the most gloriously offensive insults at me the morning of the baptism. 

My question is, what do I do now? I would love to thank him for welcoming me into the Fellowship of the Masshole and granting me now the right to baptize the next acolyte but I bet he doesn't even remember me. I feel like it would be awkward to just approach him? Do I write him a letter? If so I think I have a pretty good [template to follow here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6cEOk7x4HA) with some obvious tweaks. 

I think the best play is that I maybe just leave a Dunks gift card on his windshield next time I see it? I feel like he would know who it was from. 

Thoughts? Suggestions?

**Devotional: Welcoming the Stranger – Embracing Our Christian Duty to Serve Immigrants**

**Scripture Reading:**  
“Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.” — Hebrews 13:2 (ESV)

**Reflection:**  
As followers of Christ, we are called to reflect His love and compassion in every aspect of our lives. One of the most profound ways we can embody this calling is by welcoming the stranger among us, particularly immigrants seeking refuge and a better life. In a world often marked by division and fear, our Christian duty compels us to extend open arms and loving hearts to those who are different from us.

In the Bible, we see countless examples of God’s heart for the sojourner. From the Israelites, who were reminded to care for the foreigner in their midst (Exodus 22:21), to Jesus Himself, who embraced the marginalized and disenfranchised, our faith is built on the foundation of hospitality and kindness. The phrase “love your neighbor as yourself” (Mark 12:31) transcends geographical and cultural barriers. It calls us into action, urging us to become advocates for those who may feel voiceless.

**Educate:**  
Understanding the narratives and struggles faced by immigrants is an essential first step in fulfilling this call. Many arrive in search of safety, opportunity, or simply a chance to thrive. They come bearing stories of resilience and hope, though they often confront challenges ranging from language barriers and legal hardships to cultural adjustments and isolation.

By educating ourselves about the realities of immigration, we equip ourselves to better love and serve these individuals. This might involve engaging with local immigrant communities, volunteering with organizations that support refugees and asylum seekers, or simply taking time to listen to the stories of those around us.

**Encouragement:**  
Welcoming the stranger does not require us to have all the answers; it requires a willingness to be present. Each act of kindness, no matter how small, contributes to a greater culture of inclusion. When we offer hospitality—whether through a warm meal, a listening ear, or simply a smile—we mirror the heart of Jesus.

Remember the words of Matthew 25:35: “For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.” This invitation beckons us to recognize that in serving others, we serve Christ Himself.

**Prayer:**  
Heavenly Father, help us to see Your image in everyone we encounter, especially those who are outsiders in our communities. Grant us compassionate hearts and teach us to embrace the stranger with love and hospitality. Open our eyes to the stories of those around us and ignite in us a passion to serve and advocate for the marginalized. May we always remember that in welcoming them, we welcome You. In Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen.

**Call to Action:**  
This week, challenge yourself to reach out to someone from a different background. It could be a neighbor, a co-worker, or a local immigrant organization. Invite them for coffee, listen to their story, and learn about their experiences. Look for opportunities to serve, advocate, and celebrate diversity in your community. Together, let’s honor our calling to love and welcome the stranger, reflecting the inclusive love of Christ.

1hcz7ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hcz7ot/relationship_help/,Relationship help,"I need some advice. I’ve been married for 13 years. I met my husband when I was 17 and he was 19. We’ve always had a pretty good relationship overall. However, I got pregnant six months into the relationship and had our daughter when I was 18. It was tough being a young mom—navigating motherhood and a new relationship, which was barely over a year old by the time our daughter was born.

The challenges came quickly: both of us were studying at university, struggling financially while living on Centrelink, juggling bills, and raising a child. Two years later, we had another child. At the time, our logic was to “get the chaos over with” while we were already in it. Was it the right choice? Who knows—but it’s what we did, and now our kids are 10 and 12.

Over the years, our relationship has had its ups and downs, as I assume most do. We’ve both brought things to the relationship that could have been handled better—how we treat each other, prioritize each other, and show respect. I know I’ve done many wonderful things as a partner, but I also recognize times I’ve fallen short, especially in how I’ve handled conflict or differences of opinion.

Three years ago, my husband told me he had kissed another woman. Once in 2019 and again in 2021, both at work functions with heavy drinking. He said it didn’t go beyond kissing, but it broke me. It felt like such a betrayal. He’s also always struggled with a porn addiction and has a much higher sex drive than I do, which has led to inconsistencies in intimacy over the years. There have been times when his interactions with other women came across as flirting, which concerned me, but he always insisted nothing more happened.

We’ve worked through some of these issues, and he even saw a psychologist for a while, which helped. But this year has been one of the hardest we’ve faced: career challenges for both of us, both kids being diagnosed with ADHD, multiple health issues, a family member with cancer, conflict with his family, and more. The strain has been undeniable, and I feel like we’ve drifted into a “roommate phase.” We both stopped prioritizing each other and have felt the toll.

Four days ago, we had an argument that didn’t resolve well. It seemed to stem from misaligned expectations and poor communication. We both could have handled it better, but it snowballed. Two nights ago, we finally sat down to talk. My husband told me he’s unhappy in our marriage and feels dissatisfied with the state of our relationship. He mentioned recent conflicts and how I’ve handled them poorly (which I admit I could have done better), as well as feeling rejected due to a lack of intimacy—small gestures like a kiss goodbye—and times he’s felt invalidated by my words or actions.  
I acknowledged my faults, apologised, and expressed my intentions to improve. I suggested we work on reconnecting through date nights and prioritizing each other like we do for everyone else in our lives—our kids, friends, work, and gym. But he said he feels it’s too late. He mentioned he’s tried to bring these issues up before, but I wasn’t receptive, which, looking back, may be true.

Then last night, he told me something else: three years ago, when he admitted to kissing those other women, he left out another incident. At the time, he had been flirting with a colleague I already had concerns about. He admitted to kissing her and having a “relationship” of sorts for about a month. They went on walks, had coffee and lunch together, and were emotionally close. He says it didn’t go beyond kissing and ended after a month, though he found it difficult to cut things off.

Earlier this year, in 2024, she messaged him again, claiming she’d made a new Facebook account. He admitted he initially felt tempted to engage but ultimately told her they couldn’t continue communicating and blocked her. He says this has been weighing on him, and he felt he needed to tell me.

I feel heartbroken all over again. He says he loves me and wants to work on himself and our marriage, but he also admitted he sometimes feels ashamed of being a teen parent and finds it hard to talk about having kids and a wife when people ask. He feels like people judge him for it, but he also admitted that some women flirt with him when he shares this, and he enjoys the attention.

I value marriage and commitment, but I feel so hurt and betrayed. I know relationships are two-sided, and I’ve made mistakes, but I don’t feel like I deserve this. Is it possible for him to change? Can he change? He says he’ll see a psychologist again, but can we truly get through this?

I’ve always thought of cheating as black-and-white and if it happened to me I would leave, but being in this situation has clouded everything for me. I plan to seek help for myself, but I can’t see my psychologist until February. I know posting Reddit isn’t a solution, but has anyone been through something similar? Is there hope?

It's a bit of a story, but I'm hoping some of y'all could give me advice on this. 

End of October, this guy hits me up on Grindr. I think ""oh he wants to hookup"", but he actually wants to make conversation and doesn't immediately ask me for nudes. Three hours of chatting later, I'm getting the vibe that he possibly wants more than a hookup.

During that initial convo, he mentioned that he's got plans to move down to the states in about a year or two. I immediately had second thoughts when I saw this, and so I asked him, ""so what are you looking for out of this?"" - he said ""fun, friends, dates, maybe something more with the right person"". A bit vague yeah, but I took this as a green light to keep pursuing things, especially with that last part. I thought ""you know, that's still a year or two off - let's explore this together for now and cross that bridge if/when we get to it."" This is important context.

We trade socials and chat daily for a couple weeks until we finally meet up for our first date at a coffee shop. Things go amazing - instant chemistry, and we sat there talking about everything for two and a half hours. Got back to his place where he made the first move by putting his arm around me, and we cuddle for a couple more hours, eventually making it into bed where he kisses me first. After making sure that was okay, we started making out. That's pretty much how the night went - cuddles and making out and chatting, until we decide it's time for me to head out, but before I do, we plan our next meetup. He walks me down to my car, quick kiss before I leave, seems to be going great.

Next time we meet up, he (again) invited me into bed, and this time we fuck, yada yada it's a great time and he takes me out for dinner and even pays for me afterward. Again, absolutely no sign of anything wrong. So you can see a pattern here - I'm letting him set the pace.

Now third date rolls around, we get in bed/cuddle/go out for dinner and all that, and here's where things blew up. Up to this point, things had been going well (as usual), but before I headed off, I decided to do a quick check in to see where he's at - I said, ""hey, I'm really enjoying getting to know you and stuff - I think you're an awesome guy. How are you feeling about things?"" You know, which I thought was a simple and appropriate question to ask on the third date after a month of knowing each other. And his reaction was... unexpected, to say the least. Like a switch flipped.

He immediately seemed taken aback, saying that he actually thinks he's emotionally unavailable and he needs to focus on his move, and that I was coming off too strong by asking such a question; it was 'scaring him off', he said. He also mentioned that some of my compliments were overwhelming at times. It ended with him saying that he doesn't see things going anywhere.

Now I'm like... the fuck? I really didn't think it was that deep of a question - his reaction was as if I had asked him to be exclusive right now, or something. Which wasn't my intention at all. And even so, if he had an issue with something I was doing, why not just... communicate that instead of letting it blow up in my face and shutting things down entirely? Feels like I'd been robbed of a chance to adjust if that's really what he wanted.

Now the thing I'm most irritated about is that I predicted something like this could happen, and I tried to *avoid this exact situation* by asking what his intentions were at first. I would not have gone forward with things if he had said he's looking for casual only; nor would I have gotten so attached if he didn't do all these romantic things during the times we were together. And yet it happened anyway, and I'm sitting here wondering what went wrong.

Great to find this resource.

I’ve had multiple nasal surgeries following early botched ones. Unfortunately, a surgeon who was supposed to aid my breathing, took apart my nasal bridge and rebuilt it while I was unconscious, later telling me he had “noticed some asymmetry” and “fixed it for me at the same time”. It turns out he broke and reset all my nasal bones without discussion. He later accidentally e-mailed me (was meant for his secretary) about keeping me onside. In other words, he knew bad practice had been implemented. I haven’t done any legal issues as the stress would be awful and it’s my word vs his plus I signed things on the day I guess. What an awful world. Anyway since then I’ve had chronic, intense nasal bridge pain all day every day, stiffness, tightness and what feels like severe, shooting nerve damage, as well as terrible airways and a slightly (though nothing drastic) strange appearance. 

The fixes I’ve been offered involve airway solutions but surgeons are scared to go as high as the bones saying they don’t want to cause further damage to what that maniac did. There are chips and ridges I can feel in the bones. 

I don’t know what to do and have been in a very dark place facing some very bleak, lonely choices. I recently had a female barista approach me at a regular coffee spot, and we dated for a bit, but with my chronic pain and the depression/anxiety from surgical abuse, I couldn’t perform as my libido is broken. She has since dumped me (obviously due to these reasons) leaving me feeling even worse. Clearly I shouldn’t have attempted anything while suffering this badly, but as she came to me and she was very attractive, I gave it a go, and predictably failed.

For the nasal trauma, nerve damage etc I am hoping there is some numbing injection, though doctors are being awkward about this. The antidepressant medications which are supposed to help with nerves just make me feel woozy and give me heart palpitations. 

Regarding the libido side of things, I imagine that is common in this sub due to our minds being absorbed by the pain we are constantly in. I assume the best advice would be to either stay single until doing better, or find a very supportive girl who is not high libido wanting to be manhandled all the time, as opposed to the one I was just with, who left me feeling very demoralised I wasn’t able to match her standards due to chronic pain and fatigue, and broke it off via text message despite two months of trying very hard for her.

Either way, results speak for themselves, and Stage 3 is also ready and awaiting your perusal.

1hcyso4,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1hcyso4/bottom_not_cumming/,Bottom Not Cumming,"This has been discussed in this group before but I believe my situation to be a little bit different so here it is:

I started seeing someone about 2 months ago. We met through Hinge and the connection was mostly sexual as he had pictures of himself in underwear and my first comment to him was something along the lines of me wanting to cuddle with him with naked.

Anyway, our first date was meeting at a coffee shop with the understanding that we'd fuck after. Turns out we had a pretty good conversation about our backgrounds and similarities in culture (we're both of Mexican descent). We go to lunch after coffee where the great conversation continues and then his place where I topped him. He's a strict bottom and I'm a strict top. I made him cum twice while we fucked and I myself came 3 times. 

We met again the weekend after for a dinner date and once again fucked after where we both came. 

As the weeks have progressed, we pretty much slid into the ""talking"" ""seeing each other"" phase with constant fucking. At minimum once per week. 

The problem that I'm having is that ever since that second date, he hasn't cummed at all while we fuck. Not during and not after. Pretty early on I asked him if he needed to cum to feel pleasure and he confidently said no. However, I'm wondering if he's just not that turned on as before or isn't getting as much pleasure out of it as he used to. 

I cum everytime we fuck. And I've been with bottoms that don't cum during sex before. But with him it's different because I want to make sure he's also having as good of a time as I am. And he claims he is. But given those first 2 encounters where he came quite easily, im just convinced that maybe he's not that into me anymore. 

It happened again just now. He came over to bring me lunch and fuck. We're at the point where he's met my friends and I've met his. Hell, he even took me to have wine with his dad (was very casual, not one of those ""here's my boyfriend"" situations)

It's too soon to talk with him about relationship stuff I think but that may be why I'm nervous about him not cumming.

I wouldn't be offended if he tells me he's just not getting that much of a kick out of it anymore. But he keeps sticking around and acts very turned on while we fuck... but doesn't cum. 

Idk. I guess I'm just trying to get some clarity from strict bottoms out there who have been on the opposite side. Is pleasure without cumming truly possible? Am I not doing enough for him?

1hcys5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/jeuretro/comments/1hcys5d/what_to_buy_on_amazon_a_practical_guide_to_making/,What to Buy on Amazon: A Practical Guide to Making the Most of the Marketplace,"Amazon’s vast online catalog can feel overwhelming. With millions of products—from everyday essentials to niche gadgets you never knew you needed—it’s easy to fall into an endless scroll. If you’re looking for some guidance on what’s worth your money, here’s a breakdown of categories and strategies that can help you zero in on the best purchases.

### Everyday Essentials at Your Doorstep

**1. Household Staples**:  
Think toiletries, cleaning supplies, pantry items, and pet food. Amazon’s Subscribe & Save program often provides discounts for recurring deliveries, saving you time and money in the long run.

**2. Office & School Supplies**:  
From printer paper and ink cartridges to notebooks and laptop stands, you can often find bulk deals and brand variety. Keep an eye out for AmazonBasics products—they’re usually well-reviewed, affordable, and reliable.

### Electronics & Gadgets

**1. Amazon Devices**:  
Echo speakers, Kindle e-readers, and Fire tablets are frequently on sale. These are great if you’re entrenched in the Amazon ecosystem and want voice-enabled convenience, a dedicated reading device, or a budget tablet.

**2. Computer Accessories**:  
Look for deals on cables, external hard drives, routers, headphones, and keyboards. Check reviews and Q&A sections to ensure quality—tech brands like Anker, Logitech, and TP-Link often have solid reputations.

**3. Smart Home Essentials**:  
Smart bulbs, plugs, and security cameras are often competitively priced. Just make sure the devices are compatible with your existing smart home system.

### Fashion & Personal Car

**1. Basics and Essentials**:  
Socks, underwear, plain tees, and workout gear from brands like Hanes or Gildan often come in multi-packs at reasonable prices. 

**2. Skincare and Beauty**:  
Amazon stocks a wide range of brands, from drugstore staples to K-beauty favorites. Just be sure to read reviews carefully and watch out for third-party sellers. Stick to products “Shipped and Sold by Amazon” or well-known retailers for authenticity.

**3. Seasonal Sales**:  
Check Amazon’s seasonal sales (Prime Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday) for deeper discounts on clothing and accessories. 

### Books, Entertainment & Media

**1. Kindle Books & eBooks**:  
If you have a Kindle or the Kindle app, keep an eye on daily or monthly eBook deals. You can stock up on new reads for a fraction of the cost of physical books.

**2. Board Games & Hobbies**:  
Find niche board games, puzzles, and crafting supplies. For niche hobbies—like knitting, painting miniatures, or playing D&D—Amazon often has a broader selection than local stores.

**3. Streaming & Subscriptions**:  
Beyond physical products, Amazon Prime members get access to Prime Video. If you’re looking for entertainment, consider browsing the included TV shows and movies before purchasing new DVDs or Blu-rays.

### Kitchen & Home Upgrades

**1. Small Appliances**:  
Air fryers, coffee makers, and blenders are some of Amazon’s best-selling kitchen gadgets. Compare top brands (Ninja, Instant, Cuisinart) and look at the number of reviews to gauge reliability.

**2. Storage & Organization**:  
From closet organizers and shelving units to pantry containers, Amazon has myriad options to declutter your home. The review section often includes customer photos, which help determine if a product will fit your space.

**3. Cookware & Utensils**:  
Quality cookware from brands like Lodge (for cast iron) or OXO (for utensils) can be found at competitive prices. Look for bundle deals or sets that offer better value than buying individual pieces.

### How to Find the Best Deals

**1. Use the “Today’s Deals” Page**:  
Amazon’s “Today’s Deals” section showcases Lightning Deals, Daily Deals, and Warehouse Deals. Bookmark this page and check periodically for discounts on items in your wish list.

**2. Keep a Wish List**:  
Add items you’re interested in to a wish list and monitor their prices over time. You’ll receive notifications if prices drop, helping you snag the best deal.

**3. Read Reviews & Check Q&A**:  
Before hitting “Add to Cart,” skim through the top-rated reviews and the Q&A section. Look for patterns in customer feedback—if multiple reviewers praise or criticize the same aspect, it’s likely accurate.

### Balancing Quality and Price

While Amazon is convenient, always weigh cost against quality. Not every cheap gadget will last, and not every high-priced product is worth the investment. Leverage the massive review database to guide your decisions, and don’t hesitate to return items if they don’t meet your expectations.

### Conclusion

There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to “what to buy on Amazon,” but focusing on everyday essentials, well-reviewed electronics, reliable home goods, and sought-after hobbies can help you get the best bang for your buck. With strategic browsing, careful reading of reviews, and smart shopping habits, you can transform the overwhelming expanse of Amazon’s marketplace into a personalized shopping resource that consistently delivers value.

Review: I got a brewed coffee of the day of Starbucks once and I loved it. It was fruity, slightly bitter, nice caffeine kick. But I was not aware that it changes. so far, when I am in the mood, I would drop by a Starbucks and try the brewed coffee of the day. I am still trying to figure out which one was the first one that I liked. So far I have tried the following:

Mystery Blend - 5/5
Kenya - 1/5 - bitter, very acidic, bleh...
Verands - 3/5 - aromatic, but acidic too
House Blend - 3/5 (no milk), 3.5/5 (w/milk) reminds me of Dunkin coffee... requested steam milk to be added...

Me (18m) and my gf(18f) are going through a rough patch and she says she 'doesnt want a relationship'. what should we do to prevent a breakup?

So idk how to segway from the title to the text but basically we are in a really big point atm and i know i need help. 

(Also the original title was how do i understand and stuff but the automod didnt like that)

Weve dated for 5 months after meeting in a coffee shop. Ive done some things in the past and only stopped it recently because i was motivated by her to be a law abiding citizen, but i had and still have big plans that was a point of contention in our relationship. 

Around a week before thanksgiving i sent her a note of my grievences because i was unhappy with some things and reading all that made her rethink everything up to that point. We took some space for a week while she gathered her thoughts.

The day we decided to talk again we had a really long talk and during her space she came to the conclusion that we should break up because of some of my ambitions and wants and stuff, but the main reason was that she didnt want a relationship with anyone. She feels like she loses herself in one and that she cant grow if shes in one. 

I convinced her to stay to try until the new year to see if her positive feelings of our relationship outweighed the negative feelings of not wanting to be in a relationship and for the next 2 weeks weve enjoyed each others time and discussed and mostly rwsolved the other 2 problems because i thought those were the main problems.

Only today did i realize that the main problem was her just not wanting a relationship. We talked a lot and its basically like, she loves me, she loves what we have, and she doesnt want to lose me. Shes fine with kissing shes fine with the sex shes fine with cuddling etc, its just that the title of being in a relationship, and the expectations associated with it she dislikes.

Ive talking with her to try to find ig a compromise but i dont know what to do anymore and she encouraged me to post here if i felt like it.

I guess im looking for advice or new perspectives. If you have any thoughts on why this might be, what i should ask her, topics i should bring up, solutions maybe, or anything at all.

Ill answer any questions i get too because i really love this girl, like no other i have before, she makes me happy beyond words i have available to me and i want nothing less than to spend my life with her.

Anything and everything is appreciated

1hcyoii,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hcyoii/my_moms_gentle_silent_petty_revenge/,"My Mom's Gentle, Silent, Petty Revenge!","Hello Charlotte, you make me laugh, I love your videos!! 

So this is a story from years ago when my mom finally retired from working at McDonald's. No, she was not a corporate employee; she was always in the kitchen making food. Sorry in advance; this story is long, and I'm not a great writer. And used I even used Grammarly. So eep!

To give you a bit of context, my family has never been well off, but we are a family of hard workers. My Mother was an industrial seamstress before I was born. But she left that career due to a miscarriage. Fast forward 3 kids later, she took on fast food jobs, and McDonald's was the restaurant that gave her a very steady, stable income. She worked at many Micky D's from 1992 to the early 2000s. When my parents managed to live their dream of owning a home, Mom applied at the local McDonald's near the house. And, of course, they will give her a job; she has all the experience.

However, my mom never wanted to become the manager or any of those responsibilities. She was really weird about that. She was already the de facto kitchen manager, so why not have the title and pay to go with it? She always responded, ""It's just more work and not that much more in pay."" In the late '90s and early 2000s, that definitely was the case. Now, because my mom had been working at Micky D's for so long, she did get noticed by corporate and franchise owners, and they knew her by name. My Mother even had regulars who would wait for her or request for her to make their breakfast. (When she made a breakfast burrito, she'd give you your money's worth)  Mom only worked in the mornings to the end of the lunch shift. 

Now, this is important to the story. Just wait. Mom would open the store every now and again. It works because an employee and a manager would open together. The manager does manager stuff, counting money, opening registers, etc. The employee would start making coffee and doing meal prep. On infrequent occasions, my Mother would open the store all by herself. That only happened sometimes when there was no other way.The policy at that store stated that a manager had to be present when opening or closing. 

Okay, sorry for being long-winded, I need to set the scene, so here we go. So, after many years of working at this place,  a manager leaves for better opportunities, and this new one comes.

Mom does not like him.

New Manager does not like anyone at this store. 

I'm going to call him El Gringo, 'cause that is what she called him; at least the nice version. El Gringo did not like the international feel of this McDonald's store. He consistently complained to the employees that they needed to speak English. Everyone spoke English, fyi. Could it have been better? I don't know, but it was used. Because not everyone who worked there spoke Spanish, Hindi, Yoruba, or Portuguese. So, English was the common language because it had to be. It never was a problem till El Gringo. 

If you know a Libra, you know they do not like to be messed with. My mom was Libra. And she would argue and fight back. If you've ever argued with a Libra, I don't know how you survived not being a Pisces like me. 

Anywho, El Gringo hated Mom, cause her nature of not letting herself be bullied did not sit well with him. 

El Gringo would schedule my Mother to work at **3am** to open the store. **By. Her. Self!** Yes, that is a no, no. But he did it anyway. Yes, he blamed her when things didn't get done. Even though no one else would be scheduled for opening, and he would roll in 3hrs after. This cycle of abuse made my dad so mad he was going to go have a conversation with the guy. My mom and I knew it would eventually involve law enforcement, and we didn't have the bail money. So that ""conversation"" didn't happen. She told Dad she could handle herself, and I told her she should quit. But she wanted to stay on. 

Okay, so McDonald's does inspections. And before getting notified of an inspection for the next day, El Gringo was bullying Mom, and she was having none of it. Of course, he wasn't winning any arguments against her, so in a fit, he told her he would fire her. Gringo went to his office to start the paperwork but read an email about the inspection. He knew that the higher-ups loved my mom. El Gringo knew that they'd ask for her by name. She'd been there so long she was like a mascot. Plus, regardless of what bull he'd throw at her, she was a badass and knew how to get everything done. So, for that whole day, he'd tell her at every chance, that he would fire her *after* the inspection.

So my Mother, (hee, hee) went to every person working that day and told them, ""Today is my last day. But you didn't know anything."" She even called the lady scheduled to come in the following day and told her what was up. And said her goodbyes and what have you.

Well, the following morning, Mom did not come to work. No one was there to open the McDonalds. Remember, El Gringo wouldn't roll in till after she opened and did all the work. Well, because of the inspection, he came 20 minutes before the store officially opened to the public. Which is early for him. He called my mom, and she had disconnected the phone. He called the lady who was scheduled for later that morning. She could not receive phone calls either for some reason and came in at her scheduled time. NO ONE took his calls that morning. He had to rush to do everything and managed to do nothing. Customers were unhappy about the slow service and lack of organization. And regulars were unhappy that my mom, who is usually there, was not making breakfast. Inspectors came, and it didn't go smoothly. Apparently, there was a very long meeting with them and El Gringo in his office. 

 Later on, Mother learned the details when she came to pick up her last paycheck. The other manager was there to give her the gossip. I was there to be my mom's taxi and in case El Gringo showed up. They happily recounted the day full of small fires. And how the higher-ups were none too pleased with how things were being run. They also criticized his unkept appearance and notified him that there had been complaints from customers about how he treated, not only the employees, but also the customers. He had gotten a write-up that day. Bwahaha! We all had a great laugh. 

Mom took retirement and didn't go back to work. So yeah, this dude was bullying a 4 foot 9 inch 65-year-old Latina mom of 3. If this hadn't happened, she would have continued to work, maybe well into her 70s. She didn't want to sign up for retirement because she thought she'd get bored. But she later found out that retirement was alright.

As for El Gringo, he was caught stealing and got himself fired. Not even a week after receiving disciplinary action, he did this. He was seen working at another fast food place but got fired shortly after getting that job. After that, I don't know what happened to him.

So that is how my mom got gentle, silent, petty revenge! Cheers!",5,1734046493.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False
1hcyoe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hcyoe3/my_new_years_resolution_was_to_change_my_life/,"My New Year's resolution was to change my life. Nearly a year later, I'm terrified. ","I have always been my own worst enemy. On more occasions than I dare to count, two irrepressible traits of mine have led me to wreck nearly every good thing I've ever managed to have going for me: my low tolerance for boredom and my unshakable propensity for self-destruction in all its most beguiling forms. Both drew me towards my own undoing like a moth to a flame. I reduced my life to chaotic shambles over and over again with nothing more to show for it than fleeting gratification that was swiftly followed by guilt, regret, and a burning shame so overpowering that I felt sickened by it. I became painfully acquainted with the agony of self-loathing until it felt like my only remaining companion; anyone who ever made the mistake of caring about me had given up long ago.

I badly wanted to change, and swore to myself many times that I would. *No more,* I'd vow. *Never again.*

All of my promises never amounted to anything, of course. My word was as worthless as the rest of me.

And so I had no one but myself to blame for the fact that I would be entering another year alone, with nothing better to do on the last few cold nights of December than whittle away my time reflecting on everything I'd done wrong. I took my usual seat at the bar and ordered my usual drink; I was out of work once again and running alarmingly low on funds, but I would have gladly spent the last cent left to my name if it meant being distracted—however briefly—from my endless troubles and the storm in my head.

As I drank, I started thinking about everything I typically fought hard to suppress. In a matter of days yet another wasted year would be coming to a close. I thought of my many miseries and missteps and misdeeds, and found myself wondering what my life would be like if I were someone else. I wanted to be the kind of person who possessed enough strength and determination to resist falling back into the familiar arms of defeat, someone who was capable of holding down a job for more than a handful of months and lived in a home that wasn't a crumbling apartment with an eviction notice slapped onto the door, someone who knew when it was time to walk away and—

“Rough night?”

I lifted my head and peered to my right to see a weary-faced man seated on the bar stool beside me, hunched over his drink as if he were shouldering a burdensome despair even heavier than my own. I'd been so absorbed in my melancholic rumination that I suspect I would never have taken notice of him had he not spoken.

The man's appearance was strikingly disheveled, almost appallingly so. He looked as if he'd rolled out of bed and dressed his slovenly, pallid form in dirty clothes gathered from a pile on the floor before walking out the door without so much as glancing at a mirror. He wore a wrinkled pair of black trousers that were in dire need of washing and a collared shirt that appeared to have once been white but was now a slight shade of yellow and missing more than a few buttons; both garments were baggy and at least a size too big for him. His unkempt hair was the color of wet sand and clung damply to his forehead with sweat despite the night's wintry temperature. A gloomy, fatigued frown was etched into the drooping lines of his sallow mouth. The somber stranger seemed neither inebriated nor ill; his feeble presence struck me as the wounded disposition of a man who had surrendered himself to complete and utter resignation after growing far too weak to combat whatever hardships had taken their obvious toll on him.

“I could ask you the same thing,” I replied thickly, but there was no contempt in my tone. I recognized the man as a kindred spirit despite having only just met him, a fellow wayward soul who sought to drown his sorrows on a restless night just as I had on countless nights before.

The man shrugged noncommittally. It appeared no offense had been taken. “Yes, I suppose you could,” he said tiredly, his voice heavy and dull as he stared down into his drink. “I've certainly seen better nights.”

“Is that so?”

“Oh, yes. Better nights, better days. Better years.” Despite his dismal visage, the man spoke with surprising clarity.

“I'm sorry to hear that, my friend.” My compassion was sincere; as pathetic as I considered myself to be, I felt almost fortunate in comparison to the miserable figure sitting beside me.

He acknowledged me with another shrug. We sat in silence for a moment before the stranger spoke again.

“I hate my job,” he stated abruptly. “I absolutely *hate* it.”

“Ah.” I realized then that he wanted someone to talk to. “Well, I've been there more times than I care to admit. I'm actually between jobs myself. Here's hoping that something better comes along for us both.”

I raised my glass, but the man just scratched at the stubble on his pasty chin.

“That's unlikely,” he replied flatly.

I frowned. “Alright then.”

“Unlikely for me, anyway. Maybe you'll turn things around, but my own problems are hopeless.”

“That bad, huh?”

He gave me a sullen nod. I wasn't sure what to say next. “Is there anything you can do to improve the situation?” I finally offered. It was a clumsy attempt at optimism; cheerful words tasted sour in my mouth.

The woeful stranger shook his bedraggled head. “Doubtful. I believe that ship sailed long ago.”

“Hmm.” I felt foolish for trying to lighten the mood of someone so committed to their own unhappiness. Still, I pressed on. “Well, even if that's true, it doesn't mean you can't still turn things around.”

“Oh, but I'm afraid that's exactly what it means.”

“Come on now. You're still here, aren't you? Your heart's still beating. As long as you're living, you've got the opportunity to change.”

He looked up from his glass to face me. The dark circles under his eyes made it apparent that an unbearably long period had passed since he'd last enjoyed a good night's sleep. I wondered if perhaps the man was unwell after all.

“Listen, I appreciate what you're trying to do,” he said wearily, and I believe he truly meant it. “You seem like a decent person. So please don't take this the wrong way, but your advice would be far better suited for someone who might actually benefit from it.”

I shifted uncomfortably in my seat. “I'm sorry if I've offended you,” I replied carefully. “I didn't mean—”

He raised a hand to silence me. “You've done nothing wrong. We're just different people.”

“I guess so. It's just...you seem like someone who maybe isn't so different from me, that's all.”

“What makes you say that?”

I shrugged my shoulders. “Well, you're here, aren't you?”

The stranger said nothing. For an instant I regretted my words, but when he gave no indication that I had upset him I decided to continue.

“I suspect it isn't just your job that you hate. You hate the idea of things going on the same way they have been for God knows how long, but you've become so lost in your own misery that you can't imagine ever finding your way back out again. You hate waking up after getting precious little sleep, and you hate the effort it takes to keep your eyes open when the only thing you want to do is crawl back into bed so you can toss and turn all over again. You hate every second of your existence and you hate every choice you've ever made that's led you to this point. But most of all, you hate yourself so much that you can't even stand to look at your own reflection.”

The man stared at me. A tense, silent moment passed.

“Well,” he said finally, his voice devoid of any anger or bitterness, “I suppose you're not entirely wrong.”

I shrugged again. “Like I said, I don't think we're so different. And take it from somebody who knows: sitting at this bar won't solve any of your problems.”

“And what do you think would?”

“Well, that's up to you to decide. You can try to salvage what you have now, or maybe it'd be better to start a new beginning somewhere else.”

“I don't know. Would you want to start all over again?”

“Sure, why not? I've done it many times before.”

The man turned away from me and returned his gaze to his glass. I considered ordering another drink, but a glance inside my wallet revealed that I barely had enough money to cover my tab. I got up and went to the bar's restroom; when I returned, the man was gone.

A week later, I lost my apartment when I failed to come up with the back rent I owed. With nowhere left to go, I swallowed what little remained of my pride and asked my father for help. Dad took pity on me and let me move in with him on the other side of town, but not without setting some ground rules first: he told me that what I'd done in the past wasn't going to be tolerated this time around, and if I went back to my old ways then I was on my own for good. I agreed and shook his hand. Dad's apartment was a small one-bedroom, which meant that the living room couch also served as my sleeping quarters. He pulled a few strings and got me a job at an office building where he used to work; it didn't pay much, but Dad wasn't charging me rent and the work kept me busy. Slowly but surely, the storm in my head began to dissipate.

All of my problems didn't simply go away, of course. Sometimes I'd lie awake on the couch, staring up at the ceiling as the sound of Dad's snoring drifted down the hallway, and find myself yearning for the chaos I had been mired in for so very long. The temptation to slip back into my former habits threatened to devour me alive. But I held on tightly to my newfound determination, and as the weeks turned into months I eventually started to feel something that resembled optimism.

One night in March I came home later than usual after pulling some extra hours. I showered and carefully navigated my way through the dark living room, doing my best not to wake up Dad, before sinking onto the couch with a tired sigh and picking up my phone. I don't use social media and rarely have any calls to return or texts to respond to, but I've developed the routine of unwinding before bed by catching up on the day's news. As I scrolled through the headlines, a particularly macabre string of words caught my eye.

***Nineteen people killed in local nightclub fire; death toll expected to rise.***

I pulled up the article and flipped through its accompanying photo gallery. When I got to the final image, I saw something so startling that I nearly dropped my phone.

Among a mournful crowd that had gathered around the burnt remnants of the club stood someone familiar: the morose man I'd met in the bar on that cold December night, now clean-shaven and dressed in an impeccable black suit, his sleek form a far cry from the disarrayed figure I'd encountered months ago. Like the grief-stricken faces surrounding him, the man was openly weeping.

I stared at my phone in disbelief. Seeing the stranger's profound despair in an image of devastation and agony was as unsettling as it was shocking. My eyes remained fixated on the screen as I wrapped my blanket tightly around my shoulders, chilled by the cold wave of sadness washing over me.

When my father trudged drowsily towards the kitchen in the early hours of the morning he found me wide-awake on the couch.

“Everything alright, son? Didn't you work late last night?”

I crossed the room and handed him my phone. “Dad, look.”

Dad wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his robe and peered down the at the screen, furrowing his brow as he read.

“Oh, that's awful,” Dad said. “Those poor people.”

“You see that guy in the suit? I met him right before I moved here.”

Dad squinted and brought the phone closer to his face. “What guy?”

“The one wearing a black suit. He's the only person who's dressed up.”

“I don't see who you're talking about.”

I took the phone out of my father's grasp and looked at the screen. My eyes widened when I saw that the man was no longer in the photo.

“Are you feeling okay?” Dad's expression had shifted from sluggish and sleepy to a concerned frown.

I tried to swallow the feeling of dread threatening to climb its way up my throat and spill out of my mouth. I didn't understand what was going on, but I also didn't know how to explain it to Dad without making him think that I was losing my mind.

“Yeah, Dad,” I answered in as casual of a tone as I could muster. “I'm fine. I'm just tired and thought I saw somebody that I recognized, that's all.”

I slipped my phone into the pocket of my sweatpants and gave him what I hoped was a reassuring smile, but Dad still seemed uneasy.

“Why don't you sit down? I'll brew some coffee.”

Dad continued to talk to me as he moved throughout the kitchen, but I was so lost in my own thoughts that I barely heard a word he said. I wanted to believe that I'd been mistaken, that exhaustion and working long hours had caused me to see something that wasn't really there. But I knew that wasn't true even as I tried to convince myself otherwise; I had stared at the photo for what felt like hours, immersed in the grief it exuded, and not once had it changed until the moment my father laid eyes on it.

But how was that possible?

Three weeks later, I read about a pair of local newlyweds who perished when a drunk driver slammed into their car as they drove to the airport for catch a flight for their honeymoon. The article included images of the wreckage; pictured weeping beside the mangled car was the bereaved stranger, his sorrow as poignant as it'd been at the scene of the burned-down nightclub. The following month I saw a photo of him sadly observing a recovery team as they solemnly searched a reservoir for a drowned child's body, and not long after that I saw him again in the background of an image depicting a despondent woman standing on the edge of a bridge as officers tried in vain to talk her down seconds before she leapt to her death.

Each time I showed my father the pictures, the man would disappear from them entirely. I stopped after Dad told me that he had grown alarmed by my recent obsession with morbid events, but as the months have passed by I've continued to see the man from the bar appear in photos of regional tragedies. I don't understand who—or what—he is. I have often wondered if he is some sort of messenger or guide, arriving at scenes of death to assist the departed in whatever comes next, or if perhaps he is drawn towards grief and compelled to appear like a designated mourner attending a funeral. But it has also occurred to me that his role could be something more ominous and grim; perhaps the man I met is an architect of suffering, overcome with remorse as he observes the pain he has been assigned to create, weeping over the knowledge that it will be only a matter of time before he must construct another demise.

December has arrived once again. I have managed to hold onto my job, and living with Dad has proven to be stable and uneventful. But all my hopes for the future are gone; in their place lies the inescapable knowledge that something terrible is about to happen.

Tonight a holiday party was held at my workplace. One of the secretaries brought her instant camera, the kind that prints out photos. I didn't realize she was taking my picture until I saw the white flash. She laughed when she saw my confused expression and assured me that she wouldn't include the photo with the others she'd pinned onto the festively-decorated bulletin board. She handed it to me the instant it developed, then gave me a small smile before making her departure.

And now I've locked myself in one of the empty offices, more terrified than I've ever been before in my life. I don't know what to do. I want nothing more than to go home, but I'm too afraid to leave for fear of what I might encounter. I can't stay hidden in this office. If everyone turns off the lights and locks the doors and leaves me behind, blissfully unaware that I'm still here, then I'll be left alone in the dark—at least, I pray that I'll be alone.

I know I'm only prolonging the inevitable. There's no outrunning whatever it is that awaits me.

You see, when I looked down at the photograph I saw something that made my stomach drop. I had been sitting by myself at one of the small tables set up for the party when the picture was snapped, several feet away from all my socializing coworkers, but the photo revealed that I wasn't alone.

UPDATE: Got that error cleared by tightening the stepper motor (screw was a few turns too lose) and adjusting the encoder.

1hcymzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1hcymzp/just_tested_the_new_sabrina_carpenter_perfume_me/,Just tested the new Sabrina Carpenter perfume- “Me Espresso”… Here’s my thoughts: ,"The notes for Sabrina’s new perfume are (this is from the ScentBeauty website fyi): “…rich Cocoa Powder and Espresso Bean with the sensual allure of Night-Blooming Jasmine and Vanilla Orchid. Buttery Biscotti adds a delectable sweetness, while a finish of Caramel Drizzle, Sugared Amber, and Whipped Cream creates an irresistible warmth. Feel bold, confident, and unforgettable—get them addicted to your essence and leave a lasting impression with every spritz.”

I bought this thinking it would be a cozy, very gourmand warm/ coffee scent. It really sounded like it would be a deep sensual cafe- type vibe. Those were my expectations before trying it out. I just got it in the mail and spritzed it on me here are my thoughts-

Initial spritz, I get the coffee/espresso at the top but it quickly disappears as soon as you spray it pretty much. 

On my skin, once it’s dried down I’m getting the jasmine notes the strongest. It’s a clean “blue” feeling jasmine, partnered with the vanilla orchid coming in close second. This is very pretty, heavy-ish jasmine. It smells like clean laundry to me. If I smelled this on someone passing by I might think they smell fresh and clean and maybe that was a smell of their clothes being freshly washed in a slightly floral detergent. It is really pretty- I don’t think it’s a bad scent at all, actually it’s very nice and cozy in its own way. It’s cozy and clean. 

To me this smells similar to Gucci Gorgeous Orchid , maybe mixed with some Warm & Cozy by PINK. (not gourmand to me at all, but I’m not that upset by it since it’s still very pleasant smelling). The vanilla orchid and floral notes is probably what makes it similar to Gorgeous Orchid. 

I picture this being a scent if you want to cozy up, take a nice shower and maybe fold laundry, light some candles and relax at home. It’s just that relaxing clean smell. And it’s uplifting. 

I wouldn’t buy this if you’re looking for a gourmand perfume like Bianco Latte, it’s not similar like that perfume at all. It could be me and the way my sense of smell is- but no gourmand notes to me personally. I’m not sure if I will return this or not. A side note- the 60ml bottle is quite big and it’s almost too big. I was hoping for 30ml but I blind bought what was available. 

Anyway this is my (personal) review! I hope someone finds it entertaining or helpful. I’m also hoping to hang onto it for a little bit this week and see if it “macerates” more into a gourmand scent, since it is a really new perfume- who knows! The scent could change with time.

I usually last a year before quitting due to burnout given that they need me that bad and are willing to deal with me being late constantly. Eg. small businesses, restaurants, day cares. Or I get fired if I stay despite being burnt out. Keep in mind it became worse and almost unmanageable after I left a narcissistic abuse situation. But it was also only after that discovered I could have adhd. (And only recently considering audhd)
It would seem like I got better. The beginning of a job is interesting and then once I’m an expert I’m fighting to get rid of boredom like it’s made out of spikes but trying to force it away is like leather pants on a trampoline house. Then rinse and repeat. 
I’ve done a lot of research worked on myself with patience. Giving myself wins when I can. Learning to be kinder to a possible disability. Making goals like getting diagnosed and treated and other life goals/burdens. 

Fast forward, I recovered from my most recent burnout and I have the motivation to get a new job. It’s great. Attendance is measured per month along with performance. That’s wonderful for me. I’m at the job site so it’s easier to go back to work. They had great tasting water(I got a water bottle and drank so much water), free coffee (I bought a tumbler and had my daily coffee), they had a snack stall and sandwiches or cup noodles. I still haven’t learned how to meal prep so this was great. My boss sat right behind me, so accountability right there, or if I was sleepy I’d stand and look around the cubicles. I was allowed to crochet!!! On calls!!! Or do puzzles or draw?? I was learning new words everyday (interpreter) and no call was ever the same so the intrigue is there. Not everyday was interesting but in the same hand it wasn’t boring everyday. I loved driving in the morning but also have an intense fear of driving sleepy so it actually motivated me to go to sleep on time. Instead of pushing I knew that no one else would be mad if I said I have to drive in the morning for 25 min (20  but I always over estimated). I learned to lie to myself in terms of time to my benefit. Etc etc you get the gist. 

Then the company went remote. My car broke down. I had no choice but to sign up to be one of the 1st home when I wanted to be last. Its been one month. One month. I’m burnt out. I want to cry. I used ALL 50+ hours of PTO/PST. I’m struggling on 2-4 every two weeks. It only becomes less. This month while remote has been my worst month and if I do it again for December (with nothing to cover me) I’ll possibly get terminated. I finally got health insurance through them. Finally on the road to potential diagnosis.. 
today, during lunch I took a nap because I couldn’t focus. Didn’t sleep well per usual since home. I slept with my partner who is autistic and we suspect audhd as well. And he’s not the best motivator to help me get out of bed. We just go back to sleep. It’s dreadful having to get out and him being there was better, but worse due to the consequences. So an issue is not being able to split ways. However he is my accountability buddy when I work. Him being in the room while I work helps lessen the leather pants in my trampoline house. 
But no free coffee, I’m 95% responsible for my own food, no pressure to sleep early, no water dispenser, desk I have is small no space to crochet. It’s a nightmare. And I need help. I have no motivation to keep up or relearn a new system. Not quick enough at least. ",1,1734045909.0,AuDHDWomen,0,0.99,False

1hcygjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/cliobra/comments/1hcygjk/microinvesting_apps_can_spare_change_turn_into/,Micro-Investing Apps: Can Spare Change Turn into Wealth?,"Do you think investing is only for people with loads of cash?

Think again.

Micro-investing apps are flipping the script, turning *spare change* into a legitimate path to building wealth.

But is it all it’s cracked up to be?

Let’s break it down.

# What’s the Deal with Micro-Investing?

Micro-investing apps let you invest tiny amounts of money.

Think pennies, nickels, dimes.

They round up your purchases and toss the spare change into an investment portfolio.

**Here’s the thing:** It’s not about the size of the investment.

It’s about consistency.

That $0.72 from your morning coffee? It adds up.

# Why Are People Talking About It?

The buzz is real for three reasons:

1. **No Big Bucks Needed** You can start with next to nothing—no giant paycheck, no big risk.
2. **Set It and Forget It** The apps automate everything. No spreadsheets. No headaches.
3. **Financial Literacy on Steroids** These platforms teach you the basics, so you’re not flying blind.

# Does It Really Work? Let’s See the Numbers

* The global market for micro-investing platforms was worth **$665.7 million** in 2024.
* It’s projected to hit **$4.47 billion by 2034**, growing at a wild **21% CAGR**.

Translation: This is not a fad.

# What’s the Catch?

Here’s the honest truth:

* **Fees Can Be a Sneaky Drain** If you’re only investing a few bucks a month, a $1 fee eats into your returns fast.
* **Slow Growth Isn’t for Everyone** Spare change investing won’t make you a millionaire overnight. But it’s a long game, and patience pays.
* **Limited Control** Some apps pick where your money goes. Want to invest in specific companies or funds? Not all platforms allow that.

# How Much Could You Actually Make?

The potential is real, but it’s not magic.

Let’s say you invest $30 a month using spare change.

* With a 7% annual return (a common average for stock markets), you’d have about **$12,000 after 20 years**.
* Add in regular contributions or increase your amount, and the numbers grow fast.

# Top Micro-Investing Apps to Know About

Not all apps are created equal.

Here are some crowd favorites:

# 1. Acorns

* Rounds up your purchases and invests automatically.
* Portfolios are diversified based on your goals.

# 2. Stash

* Invest in fractional shares of big companies.
* Provides bite-sized financial lessons for beginners.

# 3. Robinhood

* Commission-free trading.
* Perfect for those who want to handpick their investments.

# 4. Raiz

* Popular in Australia.
* Focuses on long-term ETF investing, also with round-ups.

# 5. Moneybox (UK)

* Rounds up change and invests in stocks, pensions, or savings.
* Simple and flexible.

# Is It Worth It?

If you’re someone who’s always said, “I’ll invest when I have more money,” this might be your chance to start now.

* **Low Barrier to Entry**: Spare change isn’t missed.
* **Habit Building**: It turns saving and investing into second nature.
* **Long-Term Potential**: Small amounts grow big when given enough time.

# Quick Tips to Get Started

* **Pick an App That Fits Your Goals** Want control? Try Robinhood. Prefer automation? Acorns or Raiz are your friends.
* **Watch the Fees** A $1 monthly fee doesn’t seem like much, but for tiny investments, it adds up.
* **Don’t Rely on Micro-Investing Alone** Use it as a supplement, not your entire strategy. Combine it with larger investments as your income grows.

# Final Thoughts

Can spare change turn into wealth?

Yes—but only if you’re patient, consistent, and choose the right tools.

Micro-investing apps aren’t get-rich-quick schemes.

They’re a stepping stone—a way to dip your toes into the investing world without needing a fat wallet.

Take the first step.

I would see her often at my parish. For probably about 2.5 months I noticed her playing eye contact games with me. I always caught her staring. I looked for all the signals to approach you could find: lingering, eye contact, proximity, etc. Eventually, I finally approached her and introduced myself. Fast forward a week, I approached again and asked her out and to my excitement she said yes! We went on one date for coffee and it went really well. It turns out, she had confirmed all my usual suspicions of what I was feeling and she definitely noticed me. She confirmed there were some other mutual friends over the last month telling her about me too, attempting to introduce the two of us, but ultimately the move had to be on me. She also confirmed she was kind of waiting for me to do something. Then we went on another date that went equally well. She's says attracted to me and I make her nervous. However she went in depth about how her last breakup 7 months ago really hurt her and she's very guarded and an overthinker. Then the next day she calls me and says ""I took it to prayer and I don't think we should continue this, I'm not ready, and I have no answer if we are going to revisit this"" Why even say yes to the date? Am I just being let down easy? I shouldn't be bummed but I kind of am and I don't usually care for rejection, this just feels a little different. She's probably one of the most pious and holy girls I've ever taken on a date, after going on so many dates with all kinds of girls, non-christian, christian, catholic etc. It doesn't help that I see her at daily mass multiple times a week too.

There is a friend of ours who has been a bit flirty with him, and we discussed it previously. Yesterday, we didn’t talk much but he came to my job with her, and when I ran out to get dinner and returned they were gone. He sent me a photo of him at her house with one of her pets. When I asked him if he was at her house he said he only dropped her off. When he came back he slightly changed him story and after some pressing he starting slowly telling me exactly what happened. 

Apparently he was walking, they saw each out walked together, then he drove her somewhere, went and got coffee, then they went to her house, where he said they watched tv and he played with her pet. He told me that he was going to tell me everything when he saw me again, but it just felt sketchy. 

I don’t think they had sex, but this has made me very insecure, especially considering she flirts with him, and just the lack of communication. 

Please any perspective would be much appreciated.

1hcydwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hcydwn/rejection_that_stings_a_little_different/,Rejection that stings a little different,"I've been crushing on this girl for a while now. I would see her often at church. For probably about 2.5 months I noticed her playing eye contact games with me. I always caught her staring. I looked for all the signals to approach you could find: lingering, eye contact, proximity, etc. Eventually, I finally approached her and introduced myself. Fast forward a week, I approached again and asked her out and to my excitement she said yes! We went on one date for coffee and it went really well. It turns out, she had confirmed all my usual suspicions of what I was feeling and she definitely noticed me. She confirmed there were some other mutual friends over the last month telling her about me too, attempting to introduce the two of us, but ultimately the move had to be on me. She also confirmed she was kind of waiting for me to do something. Then we went on another date that went equally well. She's says attracted to me and I make her nervous. However she went in depth about how her last breakup 7 months ago really hurt her and she's very guarded and an overthinker.

For example, I normally drink Oat milk for my coffee and recently I made a change to Cashew milk because I wanted to try something new. For a few dates now, I hardly make #2. 

Another time this happened was when I chanced the type of water I drink. I typically drink purified water, but once I went to springwater for only a few days, my digestive system changed again. I was hardly going to the bathroom to make #2 and always felt so bloated.

I've done a tarot mechanic, a banes and boons mechanic, and some creative work with death saves to make them more engaging and cinematic. I also run combat way more complicated than it needs to be to keep life interesting for me behind the screen during a part of dnd that makes my brain hurt. So let's just say I really enjoy making my life way harder than it needs to be. 

I also love giving DM Inspiration to my players as rewards for being super in character, making me and the whole table laugh, or bribing me (if you bring me coffee, salty carbs, and redbull to run a marathon 8-12 hour long game I love you forever you earned the d20 reroll let's be real). I know there's a new mechanic in the 2024 ruleset for heroic inspiration but, I want it to be more than just rerolling a dice.

The problem we've had is we're a bunch of adhd bastards, so when you give inspiration it expires at the end of the session more often than not forgotten and unused. So I'm wanting to try something home brewed for our game and what I've come up with is this:

I have about 100 of these neat cardstock fantasy book marks. 

On the back of the bookmarks (I doubt I'll use all 100 of them) I'm going to write buffs and boons that aren't completely game breaking, and when a player does something that would normally earn a dm inspiration, I'm going to pick five at random and let the player choose one of them sight unseen. They can have up to three at any given time. Use them once ONE AT A TIME and then they go back into the stack.

Yeah this might sound stupid and overly complicated to some, but we love a good physical little trinket reminder of something and it feels good to know you're not going to waste that reroll trying again and failing anyway... so this is what I want to do. If it doesn't work out, I'm out like four dollars and a bit of wasted time. 

Some of my ideas are:

+2 to AC until end of turn
+4 to an attack roll
1 reroll of any d20 roll
impose disadvantage on an opposing roll
Auto succeed one skill check

I'm looking for some input on more ideas for things to use on these from the community. Any ideas on things to use be appreciated, from players and dms alike!

I'm an amateur writer, mainly focused on but not limited to dark, horror and fantasy themes. I mainly write as a hobby (most of which I post online) or to supplement/contribute my music and art projects. I plan on having my work published as a book in the near future which I currently am working on. I draw inspiration from mythology, tabletop roleplaying games, video games and franchises that involves a large scope of worldbuilding and lore,

I offer writing, ghostwriting, research, editing and proofreading, mainly but not limited to stories, prose and poetry, essays, blogs and articles. My writing style is mostly narrative-driven that may include character-making and world-building. I have also done commissions for school/college papers, thesis and dissertations for about 2-3 years back in college. I'm going by the standard, minimum rate of P1/word for larger projects, while smaller ones can go as low as a cup of coffee! Writing is a fun and therapeutic activity for me, especially when you're able to bring scenes and characters to life that are only limited by the depths of the imagination. So let's maximize that and let's build something together!

So I have an electric wheelchair with a VERY temperamental battery which I tend to need to top up a lot since it's died on me one too many times. 

I'm headed into Brum tomorrow and I'll be meeting with a friend on Birmingham New street station and hanging around the city!

Does anyone know of anywhere in and around Brum (preferably somewhere I can stay for a bit like a coffee shop that's accessible) that has plug sockets? (my chair can't charge with a usb) 

I know the library does, but I'll kill my battery just getting to and from there as it's very out of the way. 

Any suggestions are welcome! Tysm!

1hcybe5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDDSharing/comments/1hcybe5/pmdd_high_acidity/,PMDD & high acidity!,"Hi everyone 💗 I shared this in the other group and was invited to share here! 

I have had some bad symptoms of PMDD the last few months and discovered the connection of histamine intolerance in the body and PMDD caused high acid in the body. There’s a lot of doctors talking about it on YouTube. 

I saw a lot of recommendations for famotidine as a helpful over the counter solution but it doesn’t get to the root cause. Famotidine just blocks the histamine receptor so it is really just a mask for a problem that is still occurring in the body but your brain isn’t registering it (sorry if my non-doc terms don’t work for you). 
Anyways, I was having a BAD time on Sunday while I was doing this research, but it made sense because I’ve had allergic reactions in the past from histamine and had to take daily allergy meds a year before I was diagnosed with PMDD (almost 8 years ago). I’ve had acid reflux since I was 12. Everything was just adding up.

Monday-Wednesday I decided to combat the histamine intolerance with a low histamine diet (mostly avoiding dairy, coffee, and tomatoes) and by adding 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to my water, and taking magnesium, and turmeric at night like I should’ve been doing.

I’m noticing a difference and felt less viscerally reactive. My period actually came on time vs. dragging me through the mud an extra 3 days (which happens to me sometimes).

I’m still having problems with my boyfriend but there’s issues we both need to work on that I really need to take into consideration before continuing our relationship. It’s no surprise that PMDD just exacerbates some of those issues.

The question is how to tackle the root cause of high acid in the body.

Anyways, I’ll keep experimenting and report back! I was having a meltdown and felt so much better when I drank the baking soda in my water. Even my breast pain subsided. Interesting.

1hcy6yo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hcy6yo,What’s the best way to clean an antique velveteen (?) couch and chair?,"I got a matching couch and chair set off of Facebook marketplace recently. They’re at least 40 years old and were reupholstered at some point, but that company closed a few years so I can’t ask them for care instructions.

I’m fairly sure that the fabric is velveteen. The color is brighter in the folds where the tufting is, but I’m not sure if the fading is from sun exposure or not being cleaned. There are a couple small holes in the fabric, and I believe that the back cushions will need a bit more stuffing at some point. There’s also some damage to the frame and a missing piece of one of the arms.

But my main goal at the moment is just to clean it as much as possible without deconstructing it.

The seat cushions are removable and have zippers, so I might be able to pull out the stuffing and throw them in the laundry (unless that would be a bad idea?).

The back cushions aren’t removable, and I have no idea how best to tackle cleaning them. A damp microfiber cloth to remove dust? Some sort of specialized upholstery cleaner?

Any tips/advice would be appreciated! And let me know if I need to add more photos. Thanks!",2,1734045086.0,furniturerestoration,1,1.0,False

Is the hot chocolate from the kiosk supposed to taste like it has coffee in it? It's a brand new location and they're busy because people are a bit feral about new stuff around here and if it was an honest mistake, no big deal. If this is how it's supposed to taste, also not a big deal; I just won't order the hot chocolate again. I got the chocolate cream one first, didn't finish it because it tasted like it had just a bit of coffee in it, hoped it was a fluke and got a cookies and cream hot chocolate instead.

It also tastes the same. I would like to repeat it was from the kiosk and made behind the counter; the hot chocolate machine that's self-service was for hot water only at the time I ordered these.

Oats deserve more to them! Here are some suggestions I have for oats:

Homemade Granola Bars: Classic travel snack, making a good bite for the road. Would last a good while and be fairly calorie dense. Would potentially use oats, maple syrup, peanut butter, condensed milk, or acorns. Would have to be left outside to cool before being ready to eat. The tradeoff for being a good travel food would be cooking time.

Oatcakes: Another travel food with a bit of Canadian heritage. and often ate with tea or coffee. Fairly good calorie density. Would use oats, flour, salt, cooking oil, and water.

Non-food idea: Oats could be spread around outside in forested locations as wildlife bait. Checking back the next day, deer, rabbits, or even a moose might show up.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

Additionally, you can often add a personal touch, such as a message or special design, making the gift feel unique.

### No Expiration Worries

By giving the gift of a gift card, you’re allowing someone to step outside their comfort zone.

### Budget-Friendly

Gift cards can be budget-friendly gifts. You can set a spending limit that works for you. This flexibility helps to avoid overspending.

Let's face it, bad breath, or halitosis as it’s clinically known, can be a real social hand grenade. It can knock your confidence down a peg or two and make even the simplest interactions feel awkward. You brush, you floss, you gargle, but the problem persists. So, what's the next step? That’s where the search for ""bad breath doctors near me"" comes into play. This article delves into everything you need to know about finding the right professional to help you conquer chronic bad breath, understand its underlying causes, and ultimately, breathe easy again. We'll cover everything from different types of specialists to treatment options, ensuring you're equipped with the knowledge to freshen up your oral health journey.

Bad Breath Doctors Near Me: Who Are They?
-----------------------------------------

Looking for a ""bad breath doctors near me"" often starts with a general internet search. But who are these professionals, really? Well, several types of specialists can help, and understanding their roles is key to finding the right fit for you. Let's break it down:

### 1. Dentists: Your First Line of Defense

Your general dentist is a great starting point. They can identify common oral hygiene issues contributing to bad breath, such as gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis), cavities, and lingering food particles. Regular checkups and cleanings are crucial for preventing and managing these problems. Think of your dentist as the quarterback of your oral health team, coordinating your care and making referrals if needed.

### 2. Periodontists: Gum Disease Gurus

If gum disease is suspected as the culprit behind your breath woes, a periodontist is your go-to expert. These specialists focus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of gum disease, including advanced procedures like scaling and root planing. They’re like the specialized mechanics of your mouth, getting deep into the engine room to fix the underlying issues.

### 3. Oral Surgeons: Addressing Underlying Issues

In rarer cases, bad breath can stem from more complex oral health conditions like impacted wisdom teeth or oral infections. That's where an oral surgeon comes in. They can perform surgical procedures to address these issues, eliminating the source of the bad breath. Consider them the surgeons of your mouth, tackling the bigger, more complex cases.

### 4. ENT Specialists: Beyond the Mouth

Sometimes, the root cause of bad breath isn't in your mouth at all! Ear, nose, and throat specialists (ENTs) can investigate issues like sinus infections, tonsillitis, or post-nasal drip, all of which can contribute to halitosis. They’re like detectives, searching for clues beyond the usual suspects in your mouth.

Bad Breath Doctors Near Me: Deciphering the Causes
--------------------------------------------------

So, you’ve typed ""bad breath doctors near me"" into your search bar. But before you book that appointment, it’s helpful to understand the potential causes of your bad breath. This understanding can help guide your search for the right type of “bad breath doctors near me” and ensure you receive the most appropriate care. Here's the lowdown:

- **Poor Oral Hygiene:** This is the most common culprit. Leftover food particles become a breeding ground for bacteria, releasing those unpleasant sulfur compounds that cause bad breath. Regular brushing, flossing, and tongue scraping are your best weapons against this.
- **Gum Disease:** Infections in the gums, like gingivitis and periodontitis, harbor bacteria that produce foul-smelling byproducts. These infections can lead to more serious issues if left untreated, so addressing them is crucial.
- **Dry Mouth (Xerostomia):** Saliva acts like a natural mouthwash, rinsing away bacteria and food particles. A dry mouth creates a perfect environment for bacteria to thrive. Various medications, medical conditions, and even dehydration can contribute to dry mouth.
- **Food and Drink:** Garlic, onions, and coffee are notorious for leaving their mark on your breath. But don’t worry, this type of bad breath is usually temporary and easily remedied.
- **Medical Conditions:** In some cases, bad breath can be a symptom of underlying medical conditions like diabetes, acid reflux, or kidney or liver problems. If your dentist suspects a medical issue, they might refer you to a specialist for further investigation.
- **Tobacco Use:** Smoking dries out your mouth and leaves a distinct, unpleasant odor. Quitting tobacco is one of the best things you can do for your overall health, including your breath.

Finding the Right Bad Breath Doctors Near Me: Tips and Tricks
-------------------------------------------------------------

The internet is a vast ocean of information, and finding the right ""bad breath doctors near me"" can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. But don't fret! Here are some tips to streamline your search and find the perfect professional to address your halitosis concerns:

1. **Use Specific Keywords:** Don't just search for ""dentist."" Try more targeted phrases like ""halitosis treatment near me,"" ""periodontist for bad breath,"" or ""ENT specialist for chronic bad breath.""
2. **Check Reviews:** Online reviews can offer valuable insights into other patients' experiences. Look for patterns in positive and negative feedback.
3. **Ask for Referrals:** Tap into your network! Ask your friends, family, and even your primary care physician for recommendations.
4. **Verify Credentials:** Ensure the professionals you consider are licensed and board-certified. This information is usually available on their websites or through professional organizations.
5. **Consider Insurance Coverage:** Contact your insurance provider to understand your coverage for different specialists and procedures.
6. **Schedule Consultations:** Meeting with a few different professionals can help you find the best fit in terms of personality, approach, and expertise. Don't be shy – ask questions about their experience treating halitosis and their proposed treatment plan.

Bad Breath Treatment: What to Expect
------------------------------------

Once you've found the right ""bad breath doctors near me,"" what can you expect in terms of treatment? Well, it depends on the underlying cause of your halitosis. Here's a general overview:

- **Improved Oral Hygiene Practices:** Your dentist might recommend specific brushing and flossing techniques, tongue scraping, or antimicrobial mouthwashes.
- **Professional Cleaning:** Removing plaque and tartar buildup through professional cleaning is often the first step in addressing bad breath caused by gum disease.
- **Gum Disease Treatment:** Scaling and root planing, antibiotic therapy, or even surgery might be necessary for more advanced cases of gum disease.
- **Treatment of Underlying Medical Conditions:** If a medical condition is contributing to your bad breath, managing that condition will likely improve your breath as well.
- **Lifestyle Changes:** Addressing dry mouth might involve lifestyle changes like increasing water intake, chewing sugar-free gum, or using a humidifier.

Beyond the Doctor's Office: Maintaining Fresh Breath
----------------------------------------------------

Finding ""bad breath doctors near me"" and addressing the underlying causes of halitosis is a great start. But maintaining fresh breath is an ongoing process. Here are some home remedies and tips to keep your breath minty fresh between appointments:

- **Hydration is Key:** Water is your best friend when it comes to fighting bad breath. It helps rinse away food particles and bacteria, keeping your mouth clean and fresh.
- **Chew Sugar-Free Gum:** Stimulating saliva production is like turning on your mouth's natural cleaning system. Sugar-free gum can help do just that.
- **Eat Crunchy Fruits and Vegetables:** Apples, carrots, and celery act like natural toothbrushes, scrubbing away debris and stimulating saliva production.
- **Maintain a Healthy Diet:** Limiting sugary foods and drinks can help reduce the bacteria in your mouth, leading to fresher breath.
- **Avoid Trigger Foods:** If you know certain foods contribute to your bad breath, try to limit your intake or brush your teeth immediately after consuming them.

""Bad Breath Doctors Near Me"": Your Journey to Fresher Breath

Dealing with bad breath can be a drag, both socially and emotionally. But finding the right “bad breath doctors near me”, understanding the underlying causes, and adopting a proactive approach to oral hygiene can transform your breath and boost your confidence.

""Discover the SECRET of Fresh breath for Dog https://freepage.pro/samutores/dogfresh""

It’s a universal truth that dogs, our lovable furry companions, bring immense joy and unconditional love into our lives. But let’s face it, there are those moments when you’ve given your pup a bath, or they’ve just had a good roll in the rain, and suddenly, your home is infused with an unmistakable odor. You can’t help but wonder: *Why do dogs smell bad when wet?*

This phenomenon is something every dog owner has experienced at one point or another. It’s rather puzzling—why does your dog, who usually radiates the sweet scent of puppy love, now resemble something akin to a wet mop? This article delves deep into the science and reasons behind that unpleasant odor. We’ll explore the biology of dogs, the composition of their skin, and some practical tips to keep them smelling fresh. So grab a cup of coffee and settle in as we uncover the mystery!

The Science of Smell: Understanding Your Dog’s Unique Aroma
-----------------------------------------------------------

Before jumping into why dogs smell bad when wet, let’s take a moment to appreciate the unique olfactory landscape that comes with owning a dog. Our canine companions have a phenomenal sense of smell, estimated to be anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 times more acute than ours! This incredible ability isn’t just for show—it plays a crucial role in their everyday lives.

### Dog Skin and Its Natural Oils

Dogs have a protective layer on their skin that secretes natural oils. These oils serve several purposes. They:

- Keep the skin hydrated
- Provide a barrier against environmental factors
- Help maintain a healthy coat

However, these natural oils can also be a part of the equation when it comes to that less-than-pleasant odor. When wet, these oils interact with water and can lead to the development of a smell that some owners might describe as ""musty"" or ""fishy.""

### Bacteria and Yeast: Uninvited Guests

Another player is the bacteria and yeast that naturally live on a dog’s skin. While these microorganisms are generally harmless, they can produce odors, especially when they come into contact with moisture. When your dog gets wet, this environment becomes a breeding ground for these little buggers. Moisture creates the perfect conditions for bacteria to multiply, and the result? Yep, you guessed it—a strong odor that could knock your socks off!

Common Reasons Dogs Smell Bad When Wet
--------------------------------------

After laying the groundwork, let’s dive into some specific reasons behind that distinct wet dog smell.

### 1. Damp Fur and Undercoat

When your pup is wet, their fur traps moisture. Depending on the breed and type of coat, especially with dogs that have thick undercoats like Golden Retrievers or German Shepherds, this trapped moisture doesn’t dry quickly. As time goes on, bacteria begin to thrive in the dampness, much like a soggy carpet after a rainy day—it’s not long before things start to be a bit ripe.

### 2. Skin Issues

Sometimes, dogs with underlying skin conditions may have a stronger odor when wet. Conditions like dermatitis or allergies can lead to inflammation of the skin, which makes it even more susceptible to bacterial growth. If you notice a persistent smell despite regular grooming and baths, it might be worth checking in with your veterinarian.

### 3. Diet Matters

You wouldn’t think about it, but what goes into your dog’s belly can impact how they smell. Just like people, dogs can have body odors related to their diet. Foods rich in certain fats or protein sources can lead to body odor when their skin gets wet. Consider this: if your dog eats a diet high in fish, it may not only affect their breath but could also linger when they're damp.

### 4. Environmental Factors

Let’s not forget that the world outside can leave its mark—and scent—on your dog. From mud puddles to sea salt from a beach outing, various environmental factors can blend with your dog's natural oils. Think of it as a recipe for odor; add in a splash of moisture, and you’ve got yourself an aromatic cocktail of wet dog!

### 5. Poor Grooming Habits

Last but not least is the grooming aspect. Regular grooming can significantly reduce that wet dog odor. It helps remove dirt, dander, and dead hair that can contribute to an unpleasant smell. If brushing your dog feels like a chore, remember that neglecting it can lead to issues—not just olfactory ones!

Tips to Minimize That Wet Dog Smell
-----------------------------------

Now that we’ve dissected why dogs smell bad when wet, let’s explore some simple and effective ways to keep your furry friend smelling fresh.

### Regular Baths

While too many baths can strip your dog’s coat of its natural oils, regular bathing (about once a month or as needed) using a gentle dog shampoo can help. Look for shampoos with deodorizing properties to combat odors.

### Thorough Drying

When your dog comes in from the rain or after swimming, make sure to dry them thoroughly. A dog towel or a pet-friendly drying device can work wonders. Remember, the drier they are, the lesser the chance of that dreaded smell.

### Clean Their Bedding

If your dog spends a lot of time on their bed, it’s essential to wash their bedding regularly. Otherwise, those odors can seep into their favorite napping spot and transfer back onto them.

### Choose the Right Diet

As mentioned earlier, a balanced diet can have a significant effect on your dog’s smell. Ensure you feed high-quality food appropriate for their age, breed, and activity level. Consulting with a veterinarian can give you insights into what dietary adjustments might keep your pet smelling fresher.

### Get Regular Grooming

No one enjoys having a shaggy look—especially if that shag comes with an odor! Regular grooming not only helps to mitigate smells, it can also keep your pet comfortable and reduce shedding. If you’re not up for it, consider taking them to a professional groomer every few months.

The Science of Deodorization
----------------------------

So what happens when your dog gets wet, and the odors start to creep in? Let’s break it down scientifically.

### The Role of pH Levels

Dog skin has a pH balance that differs from humans'. When wet, changes in pH levels can cause the natural oils to become imbalanced, resulting in a stronger odor. If your dog has sensitive skin, controlling the pH with special shampoos can help.

### Water and Bacteria

Water typically aids in cleansing, but in this case, it provides a medium for bacteria to flourish. Most bacteria are harmless, but when combined with oils and moisture, they can produce foul-smelling compounds. Once the skin dries, the lingering smell can take time to dissipate completely.

### The Microbiome Factor

Just like humans, dogs have a unique skin microbiome—an ecosystem of microorganisms living on their skin. When these organisms multiply in a damp environment, they can create an odor that’s hard to shake off. Understanding this can help us appreciate how important it is to maintain balance through proper skincare and grooming.

When to See a Vet
-----------------

If your furry friend consistently emits a strong odor, especially when they’re wet, it might warrant a trip to the vet. Here are some signs that could indicate a bigger issue:

- **Persistent Foul Smell**: If the odorous aroma sticks around even after a bath.
- **Skin Irritation**: Redness, itching, or any sores on the skin may suggest an infection or allergies.
- **Changes in Behavior**: Lethargy, excessive scratching, or changes in appetite can all be warning signs.

For many pet owners, dogs are family members. Keeping them in good health is essential not just for their comfort but also for your peace of mind!

Conclusion
----------

So, why do dogs smell bad when wet? It boils down to a mixture of natural oils, bacteria, environmental factors, and even their diet. While it can be quite the puzzle, understanding the biology behind your pup's odor can empower you to tackle it head-on.

Maintaining a routine of regular baths, grooming, and a proper diet can go a long way in minimizing that distressing wet dog smell. And remember, those adorable, furry faces and wagging tails bring so much joy that a little smell here and there is often just part of the package.

Next time you give your pup a bath, enjoy the process—even if the result isn't always a delightful scent! After all, there’s nothing quite like a wet dog cuddle, right?

So, I was in a pinch and wanted to get a quick and dirty test under my belt. This was about as quick and dirty as it can get. 

I used a laptop, streaming a song, LFE feed was a 3.5mm jack audio out splitter (split from my computer speaker feed) and this splitter converted into a pair of RCA cables which fed into an inexpensive Fosi  TP-02 subwoofer amp that then terminated in the enclosure. This was all tested while on a 30 year old rickety, metal cart on wobbly wheels. 

See? That’s about as dirty as it gets. Haha. 

Since many people were asking about whether or not a DOS setup cancels out excessive vibrations, I put a coffee mug on top so you could see the activity. 

I was blown away with how rich the sound was. I can’t wait until I find my REAL sub amp and get it set up properly. 

I did notice some air leaks from some seams, so I will be opening it up and using epoxy on every single seam in about a week or so. 

Overall, I am super happy!!

Here’s what I’ve noticed so far:

> Tabex actually works. Ever since my first pill cigarettes became nasty, tasted and smelled like burned plastic. Still felt like smoking every hour or so up until day 3, then almost felt like I was forcing myself to go outside for a smoke, just out of habit.

> Cravings are easy to overcome, but they’re there. Drinking tea, eating some snacks and physical activity drown out the cravings very quickly.

> Smells! Everything smells, bad and good, but I’m so happy to notice what I couldn’t before. It’s like my nose was operating at 20% just a day ago.

> Breathing is much easier and more pleasurable, the air outside is almost sweet. Also feels like my lungs could only fit in half of the air they normally should.

Adding to that, breathing techniques (not some mumbo-jumbo) help out whenever cravings come back. I have a habit of going outside for a smoke and coffee/tea at work, and instead of actually smoking a cigarette I breathe in as full as I can and exhale twice as slow. Repeat a few times, head gets a little spinny and I don’t want to smoke anymore. Pretty much the same as smoking minus the harm and bad smell from cigs. 

> Sleepiness, I’m definitely feeling more noticeably drowsy and my head refuses to think as quickly as it used to. Not sure when this will pass, but looking forward to recovering from this nasty addiction quickly. 

> Appetite hit like a truck, I definitely eat more and it’s much more pleasant to enjoy a meal now that senses of smell and taste are recovering.

> Erections got quicker and better. Maybe placebo (or not?), I’m only a couple years shy of 30, but I did notice worse erections lately every so often. Seems like cigs and mental stuff were the culprit, and since I now think of myself as someone who beat this awful drug I also get boners as strong as I did 10 years ago.


Tips I’d put into TL;DR:

> First and foremost you have to find a reason to quit and treat it not as a “quit” but rather a “refuse”. “I’m not quitting smoking, I refuse to smoke”. Might sound obvious, might sound dumb, but this fortifies your stance on this, because you’re not making an attempt, you’re refusing to smoke any longer. You’re not losing anything when you stop smoking, you’re getting your health back, actually. 

> Breathe like you’re smoking without smoking whenever cravings get bad. Slow deep breath in, slower exhale out. Repeat 2-3 times. 

> Tabex/Cytisine, even if you’re a sceptic: pills work, cigs become nasty and you’d feel like throwing up at day 3-5. Really helps you start hating cigs and cigarette smoke.

> Physical activity: even if you’re lazy or don’t have the time, get up and stretch well, invest a few minutes to be at least somehow active, really does help you feel better physically and mentally. 

> No substitutes: quitting with vapes, IQOS, GLO or whatever else doesn’t work, if you’re quitting taking in poison quit everything altogether.

> Think of smokes as drinking poison: would you drink a cup of poison little by little every day, knowing you’re slowly causing your inner organs to fail? Would you keep doing so even though it tasted bad and you feel worse with each day, just because you’re “addicted”?

> “Cigarettes help me calm my nerves and pass time”: — This is backwards thinking. Cigarettes CAUSE your anxiety, not calm it. This is something I didn’t understand for years and finally pinpointed now. I didn’t die from anxiety, nothing bad happened, I didn’t burst out crying when anything that could make me uneasy arose. Trust me on this, I’m living through a wartime right now, if I could force myself to quit even though I can’t be sure I’ll make it another day, then you can as well!


A short summary of my thoughts over the last day and some, today is day 2 with nothing in my lungs apart from fresh cold air. Needed to type this out to reinforce my beliefs in the evil that is cigarettes, as well as hopefully motivate someone else to read, think and stop/keep staying away from wasting their health away. 

I’m 2,5+ years clean of alcohol and 10+ months clean of weed as well, so if I could quit these habits so can you. I’m just some guy after all, not better or stronger than you. 

Again, don’t treat it like you’re trying to quit and stay away from “evil”, treat it as being done doing stupid shit to your body. It’s not some medicine that keeps you alive, it’s disgusting chemicals that are slowly taking your life.

1hcxv1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hcxv1l/recently_married_and_an_ex_reaches_out/,Recently married and an ex reaches out.. ,"30M been married 4 months, my only significant ex reaches out randomly. For context, we have had absolutely no contact what so ever for 8 years… 
I knew she got married when I was in college but learned she’s now divorced for 4 years herself, I missed the call and was surprised to see a text (I have the same number). Didn’t know it was her until I saw the text. 
I was definitely caught off guard but curious to see why she was reaching out so I told her to give me a call the next day. I did tell my wife that same day I spoke to her because I didn’t want to keep it a secret. 

My ex says she didn’t know I got married and wouldn’t have reached out if she knew I did…but it was nice catching up because we didn’t end on the best of terms. It seems like she’s being respectful of the fact that I am married. 

But is it wrong to have an open line of communication with her? If she wants to meet up for coffee to chat in person do I entertain that? Or do I just not engage any further at all, it feels like playing with fire a bit ",0,1734044166.0,AskMenAdvice,58,0.44,False
