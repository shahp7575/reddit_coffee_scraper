The primary function of a tumbler lid is to prevent spills, and the effectiveness of the design is crucial.

Advanced designs may include sliding closures, flip-top mechanisms, or screw-on tops with integrated gaskets to create a reliable, leak-proof barrier.the ability to easily open and close the lid with one hand is also a significant advantage.

**Ventilation**

Proper ventilation is essential for comfortable drinking and prevents pressure buildup inside the tumbler. Well-designed lids will incorporate a small vent hole or channel that allows air to flow smoothly while still preventing leaks. The vent should be designed to minimize splashing and ensure a consistent pour, whether you're sipping a hot coffee or enjoying a cold beverage. The location and design of the vent can greatly impact the overall drinking experiance.

**Compatibility**

Compatibility is a major consideration when selecting a tumbler lid replacement. Knowing the brand, model, and capacity of your tumbler is crucial for finding a lid that fits properly.Many manufacturers offer replacement lids specifically designed for their tumblers, ensuring a perfect fit and optimal performance. Some global lid options are available as well, but it's critically important to check the dimensions carefully to ensure compatibility. The diameter of the opening and the thread type (if applicable) are especially important.**Ease of Cleaning**

A tumbler lid that's easy to clean is essential for maintaining hygiene and preventing the buildup of bacteria and odors. Look for lids that are dishwasher-safe and have a simple design with minimal crevices where residue can accumulate. Some lids feature removable components, such as silicone rings or gaskets, that can be easily cleaned separately.The material should also be resistant to staining and retain its appearance even after multiple washes.

## Core Benefits

investing in a high-quality tumbler lid replacement offers several significant benefits, enhancing the overall user experience and extending the lifespan of your favorite tumbler.

A good replacement lid can restore your tumbler to its original functionality and prevent it from becoming obsolete due to a minor issue. This extends the investment already made in that tumbler.

**Enhanced Spill Prevention:** A properly fitting and well-designed tumbler lid replacement provides a secure seal that prevents spills and leaks, especially during travel or outdoor activities.

A massive domed stadium under blackout lights. Thunder cracks. The crowd roars.
The match? One for history: All of Blue Lock's greatest on one pitch. But the final battle isn't between teams—it's between egos.
No coaches. No formations.

---

The match kicks off in chaos. Barou tries to assert dominance, charging down the center like a warlord—but before he can shoot—

 BOOM.

Out of nowhere, Shidou Ryusei slams into the scene like a wild animal, bodies flying as he elbows past Reo and Karasu.

> Shidou (snarling):
""Don’t block my fun cucks, I'm gonna paint the pitch in blood.""

He feints left—then does a heel flick over Kunigami’s head. Kunigami lunges—misses.
Shidou lands, spins midair, then launches a flaming bicycle kick before Gagamaru can even dive.

GOAL.
1–0 

He glares at the sky, flexing. His jersey half torn, teeth bared like a beast.
The stadium trembles with fear and awe.

> Barou (growling): ""That rabid mfr…""

-

The Blue Lock players realign—but no commands, just instinct.

Isagi tries coordinating: “Flow with me, Nagi!”
But Nagi doesn’t even nod. He just floats across the pitch, untouched by chaos.

Suddenly, Reo lobs a risky long ball high into the sky. It's spinning. It's falling.
Everyone thinks it’s too high—even Bachira hesitates.

But Nagi, the alien, leaps.
Time slows.
He traps it midair with his heel, pirouettes, and lands like a ghost behind the defenders.

Three defenders collapse.

> Nagi (softly):
""Let’s make this fun.""

He flicks the ball behind him while falling—no look. The ball curves between Rin and Niko.

Then—boom.

Outside foot volley. Net tears. GOAL.

---

The match seems headed to overtime. Everyone’s breathing heavy. Even Rin looks confused.
Shidou’s grinning. Nagi’s expressionless. Barou’s frothing. The field is war.

Then—a whistle.

The crowd turns.
Heels click.

A suited figure walks in from the tunnel.

Anri Teieri.

Yes, Anri-chan. The Blue Lock program director.
She drops her blazer. She’s in boots and shorts underneath.

> Anri (smiling):
""You boys always forget… I designed this program.""

She steps onto the pitch. Everyone pauses. Even Ego in the booth drops his coffee.

Ball rolls to her. Rin charges. So does Shidou.

But Anri... rainbow flicks over Rin. Nutmegs Shidou.

Then—Nagi tries to intercept her. But she feints with a no-motion backheel pass to herself around him.

Barou? Bulldozed.
Isagi? Bamboozled.

She’s at the box. One shot. One swing.

Top bins. GOAL.

2–1. Anri wins the game.

The crowd goes dead silent.
All egos… shattered.

“And in the land of monsters, it wasn’t the demon, the genius, or the king who claimed the final goal...
It was the architect. The queen behind the curtain.
Anri Teieri: Crowd Silencer.”

A lot of women skip dinner on a first date — not because they’re not hungry, but because they’re *intentional*.

Dinner means being stuck for an hour or more with someone she just met.  
And let’s be real — safety, vibe, and energy all matter.

So when a woman says yes to coffee, a walk, or a short meet-up, she’s not settling.  
She’s setting the tone.  
She’s prioritizing comfort, not free calories.

## Key Features Analysis

The ‌versatility and appeal of stone candle holders lie in a few key features that set them apart from other options.Understanding those features can⁤ make your buying decisions much easier.

**Material Composition**

The primary material in these candle holders is, of course, stone. this can‌ range ⁢from ⁣marble‍ and granite to slate and sandstone. The type of stone considerably impacts the holder's ⁢appearance, weight, and durability. Marble offers a sleek,‌ polished look with varied‍ veining patterns. Granite brings robustness and a⁢ grainy texture, while slate offers ​a rugged, layered aesthetic. Sandstone gives a warm, earthy tone frequently enough with visible sediment layers. Ultimately, the stone choice ⁤reflects the aesthetic ⁤and level⁢ of maintenance you’re after.**Size and Dimensions**

Stone candle holders come in various sizes, from petite tea light ⁤holders to substantial pillar candle platforms.Dimensions‌ directly effect the candle holder's visual impact and stability. smaller holders⁤ are ideal for clustered groupings to‍ illuminate a coffee table, mantle, or windowsill, offering delicate accents. Larger⁤ holders are more suitable as centerpieces or focal points, making a more meaningful statement and capable of holding larger, heavier candles. Always consider the dimensions of your space and the size of the candles you plan to use.

**Design and Aesthetics**

The design of a stone candle holder plays ⁤a critical‍ role in its overall appeal. Some ‍feature minimalist, geometric shapes, while⁣ others ‍boast intricately carved details.The finish can range ‌from⁤ raw ​and unpolished to smooth and ​highly refined.Some holders are designed to showcase⁢ the natural⁣ beauty of the stone, while ​others are crafted to complement specific decor styles such as modern, rustic, or bohemian. The ‌design should harmonize ‍with your personal taste and the overall theme of your existing⁢ interior.

**Weight ​and Stability**

Stone candle holders are generally heavier than those made of glass, metal, ⁤or wood, contributing to their inherent ⁤stability. This is a crucial safety factor, reducing ⁢the risk​ of tipping over, especially when the candle is lit. The weight ​also ⁤provides ​a sense of quality and durability. Though, excessively heavy holders might ⁣potentially be arduous to move‌ or reposition frequently.Balancing⁤ weight with the intended placement ‍and frequency of rearrangement leads to ‌a suitable choice.

**Heat Resistance Properties**

Good stone candle holders should possess excellent heat resistance. Stone is naturally resistant to high temperatures, making it an ideal material for containing⁢ burning candles. This property is critical to ‍preventing damage to the holder itself and safeguarding⁢ the surrounding ⁢surfaces. The choice of stone and its⁣ treatment impact​ heat resistance. For ‍instance,a highly polished finish may‌ be less resistant to heat than a rough,natural surface.Check ⁤that any sealants ⁤applied are heat-resistant as well.**Compatibility with Candle Types**

Stone candle holders ⁢accommodate various types of candles, including tea​ lights, votives, pillar candles, and tapers. Compatibility depends on the holder's dimensions, the design of the candle seat, and the depth ​of the receptacle. Some holders have shallow wells for tea lights or votives, ⁣while others feature deep recesses for pillar candles. Taper holders typically incorporate a narrow opening to securely hold the candle. Consider the types of candles you plan to use most often ⁣to guarantee a perfect fit.

Track your protocols, labs, and progress with the [TRT Tracker IOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trt-tracker-injections-log/id6747364258)


Ever woken up feeling like you barely slept, even after a full night in bed? Maybe you're dragging through your day, feeling a bit foggy, or just not quite like your old self. It's easy to blame stress or a busy schedule, but what if I told you that one of the most powerful levers for optimizing your male hormones-and by extension, your energy, mood, and drive-is something you do every single night?

Yep, I'm talking about sleep.

You might be thinking, ""Sleep? Really? I thought it was all about testosterone shots or fancy supplements."" And while those have their place in some scenarios, I've found that the foundational piece often gets overlooked. Better sleep isn't just about feeling rested; it's a profound hormonal reset. In this post, we're going to dive deep into how quality sleep impacts your male hormones, what that means for your well-being, and how you can harness this nightly power-up.

**The Nightly Reset - How Sleep Directly Impacts Your Hormones**

Think of sleep as your body's nightly maintenance crew. While you're dreaming, it's busy repairing, reorganizing, and most importantly for our topic, producing and regulating hormones. When you skimp on sleep, this crew can't do its job properly, and your hormonal balance starts to lean in the wrong direction.

**Testosterone - Your Prime Mover**

This is probably the big one you're thinking about. Testosterone, crucial for energy, muscle mass, bone density, and libido, is produced in a pulsatile fashion, with the highest levels typically during deep sleep.
* **Less sleep means less T production.** Studies have shown that even a week of restricted sleep (say, 5 hours a night) can significantly drop testosterone levels in healthy young men.
* **It's not just about quantity, but quality.** Fragmented sleep, even if you're in bed for 8 hours, won't give you the deep, restorative cycles needed for optimal T production.

**Estrogen (E2) and SHBG - The Balancing Act**

It's not just testosterone that sleep influences. Your body's estrogen levels (yes, men have it too, and it's important!) and Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) are also impacted.
* **Estrogen metabolism:** Poor sleep can impair your liver's ability to properly metabolize estrogen, potentially leading to higher E2 levels relative to testosterone. While some E2 is vital, too much can contribute to fatigue, mood changes, and even gynecomastia.
* **SHBG's role:** SHBG is a protein that binds to testosterone, making it unavailable for your body to use. When SHBG is too high, even if your Total T looks okay on paper, your **Free Testosterone**-the usable form-can be low. Sleep deprivation can actually increase SHBG, effectively ""locking up"" more of your valuable T.

**Prolactin - The Often-Overlooked Player**

Prolactin is a hormone typically associated with lactation in women, but men have it too. Elevated prolactin levels in men can lead to:
* **Reduced libido.**
* **Erectile dysfunction.**
* **Fatigue.**
* **Mood changes.**
Guess what? Chronic sleep deprivation can contribute to elevated prolactin. It's a domino effect, really.

**Cortisol - The Stress Hormone**

Sleep deprivation is a stressor. When you don't get enough quality sleep, your body responds by ramping up cortisol production.
* **Cortisol's impact:** While vital for stress response, chronically high cortisol can suppress testosterone production. It's a direct hormonal tug-of-war, and cortisol often wins when you're sleep-deprived.
* **Nighttime levels:** Ideally, cortisol should be low at night to allow for restorative sleep. Poor sleep hygiene often keeps it elevated, creating a vicious cycle.

**Beyond the Basics - Your Bloodwork and Sleep's Footprint**

When you get your bloodwork done, you're looking at a snapshot. But that snapshot is heavily influenced by your lifestyle, and sleep is a massive piece of that puzzle. It's not just about fixing a clinical deficiency; it's about achieving **optimal levels** for how you feel and perform daily.

**Interpreting Your Numbers Through a Sleep Lens**

When you look at your results for Total T, Free T, Estradiol (E2), SHBG, and Prolactin, consider your sleep habits.
* **Low Total T/Free T?** Before jumping to conclusions, ask yourself: Am I consistently getting 7-9 hours of *quality* sleep? Is it deep, uninterrupted sleep?
* **Higher E2 or SHBG?** While diet and body fat play a role, inadequate sleep can certainly contribute to these imbalances, making your testosterone less effective.
* **Elevated Prolactin?** Beyond other potential causes, chronic sleep issues are a common culprit.

I've seen firsthand how men who prioritize and optimize their sleep can see significant, positive shifts in these markers. It's a powerful first step on the path to hormonal balance.

**The Holistic Blueprint - Sleep as Your Hormonal Foundation**

Optimizing your hormones is a multi-faceted journey, but sleep truly is the bedrock. Without it, even the best nutrition or exercise routine will struggle to yield optimal results.

**Sleep Hygiene - Your Non-Negotiable Strategy**

This is where the rubber meets the road. Small, consistent changes can make a huge difference.
* **Consistency is king:** Go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time every day, even on weekends. This trains your circadian rhythm.
* **Create a sleep sanctuary:**
 * **Darkness:** Make your bedroom as dark as possible. Blackout curtains are your friend. Even small lights can disrupt melatonin production.
 * **Coolness:** Keep your room cool-around 65-68 degreesF (18-20 degreesC) is often ideal.
 * **Quiet:** Use earplugs or a white noise machine if needed.
* **Wind-down routine:** About an hour before bed, dim the lights, avoid screens (TV, phone, tablet), and do something relaxing like reading a physical book, meditating, or taking a warm bath.
* **Limit stimulants:** Cut off caffeine intake in the afternoon and avoid alcohol close to bedtime. While alcohol might make you feel sleepy, it fragments your sleep quality.

**Nutrition & Exercise - Complementary Powerhouses**

While sleep is the star of this show, remember that nutrition and exercise are crucial supporting cast members.
* **Nutrient timing:** Eating a balanced diet rich in whole foods supports overall hormonal health and can indirectly improve sleep quality. Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime.
* **Strategic movement:** Regular exercise, especially resistance training, is fantastic for testosterone. But time it right-intense workouts too close to bedtime can rev you up and make it harder to fall asleep. Morning or early afternoon workouts are often best.

**Smart Supplementation - Boosting Your Zzz's and T**

Certain supplements can support both sleep quality and hormonal health. These aren't magic bullets, but they can be helpful alongside a solid sleep hygiene routine.
* **Vitamin D:** Crucial for testosterone production and also linked to sleep quality. Get your levels checked!
* **Zinc:** Involved in hundreds of enzymatic reactions, including testosterone synthesis. It's also known to support sleep.
* **Magnesium:** A mineral many men are deficient in. It plays a role in muscle relaxation, nerve function, and can significantly improve sleep quality.
* **Boron:** A trace mineral that can help increase Free Testosterone and decrease Estradiol. It also has a positive impact on sleep architecture.
* **Ashwagandha:** An adaptogenic herb that helps the body manage stress, which can directly improve sleep and reduce cortisol, indirectly benefiting testosterone.

**The Payoff - What Optimal Hormones Feel Like**

So, why go through all this effort for better sleep and balanced hormones? Because the payoff is immense. This isn't just about numbers on a lab report; it's about how you **feel** and **perform** in your daily life.

**Energy, Focus, and Mood**

When your hormones are humming along, fueled by quality sleep, you'll notice:
* **Sustained energy:** No more afternoon crashes or relying on endless coffee.
* **Sharper focus:** Less brain fog, improved concentration, and better decision-making.
* **Stable mood:** Reduced irritability, better stress resilience, and an overall more positive outlook.

**Libido and Performance**

This is often a big motivator for men, and for good reason.
* **Revitalized libido:** Testosterone is directly linked to sex drive. Better sleep means better T, which often means a healthier libido.
* **Overall vitality:** You'll simply feel more ""on,"" more robust, and ready to tackle life's challenges.

**Mental Clarity and Resilience**

Optimal hormones contribute to a better-functioning brain.
* **Clearer thinking:** Decision-making becomes easier, and you're less prone to mental fatigue.
* **Improved stress handling:** With balanced cortisol and more restorative sleep, your body is better equipped to handle daily stressors without getting overwhelmed.

**Embrace the Power of Sleep**

It's easy to dismiss sleep as just ""downtime,"" but for men's hormonal health, it's a critical, active process. You don't need to jump straight to aggressive interventions when simple, consistent improvements to your sleep can unlock so much potential. Start small, be consistent, and observe the incredible changes in your energy, mood, and overall vitality. Your hormones-and your whole self-will thank you for it.

He's 7 now. As the years tick by I'm starting to believe the money may be best served in an ABLE account instead. I don't need financial support, but I want to save for his future. I can't open an ABLE account unless he's considered disabled by social security. He's really on the edge of qualifying in my opinion. I don't know if my hope of progress is blinding me to reality or if we'll see rapid improvement eventually.

He was diagnosed level 2 at 4 years old. He can't answer a question unless it has a keyword he knows like favorite foods, shower, brushing teeth, book, Mario, truck, tricycle etc.. Easily 100's if not 1000's of those words. We get by communicating to him entirely with those words. His responses are usually yes or no or small sentences like, I don't want xxx. However, any open ended questions like, what did you learn at school, how old are you, what's you're favorite xx, are all answered with good, yes, no or ignored. He sometimes pauses to think, but gives up. He has echolalia, has been in speech for years, and also spent 2 years in ABA, but stopped last year. He doesn't comprehend math. He knows his ABC's and can count to 100. He can read letters and numbers, but almost no words. He won't draw, just scribbles. He can write his first name and trace letters. He does speak with some basic sentences like, come on dad, let's go grocery store, I'm back, where's xxx, daddy gibberish pink donut, please can have turn, go to xx, it's coffee, it's soda, let's go to pool, etc.. The number of sentences keeps growing. He always wants to be near other kids and run around together, but it is hard if they don't understand.

His stimming rotates, but is often loud sounds, barking, and ear flapping. He is easily frustrated and very easily becomes anxious. (He has a strong phobia of dogs and won't touch other animals) Anything that doesn't go his way results in loud screaming and sometimes throwing stuff, though not in public.

He is still always improving. He doesn't appear like a loopy child, just a quiet one.

Hoping to get some insight from the community as I can’t get ahold of my doctor and I only just went off birth control and started trying to conceive so am still learning about this stuff. The first day of my last period was July 1st and I am pretty sure I ovulated on July 15th. It’s still 8 days before my next period is due to arrive and I had 4 positive pregnancy tests this morning. The first 3 were from Premom and then my partner went and got a First Response Early Result test which I took later in the morning after coffee and water around 10:30 AM. The First Response test appears to be a “dye stealer” where the test line is darker than the control. The 3 Premom tests have extremely dark lines. Is this even possible when I’m still so close to having ovulated and the test wasn’t even taken when I first woke up? Is this a sign of anything negative, or just the possibility of twins?

I am building an AI learning engine called Glia — an app that personalizes learning journeys. Over time, Glia learns about the user’s unique curiosity patterns and existing knowledge and curates the learning content and experience for the user. 

Glia’s mission is to democratize learning for everyone – in the world of AI, education has the power to become more and more personalized, and we deserve better learning tools that can help us grow into fuller versions of ourselves. We want to build a humanistic experience for the natural rhythm of learning.

People are already spending so much time seeking intellectual stimulation - they're just doing it inefficiently through random content consumption (social media, scattered articles, long podcast queues, etc.). Glia wants to replace that fragmented experience with an AI companion that learns how the user thinks and maps out learning curricula – as personalized as Spotify Discover, as accessible as Duolingo.

We are in private beta, get an invite code here: [www.gliahq.com](http://www.gliahq.com) 

I’m looking for a cofounder who is passionate about:

* Education! 
* Formation of knowledge and how we learn
* Building next-generation ed-tech that is creative, beautiful, and humanistic
* Shaping the future of human-computer interface

… with technical skills that can build from 0 to 1 to 100:

* AI engineering
* Preferably full-stack dev – but we can always learn together!
* Passion
* Creativity
* **Cracked** energy
* Kindness 
* Authenticity 

**About me**

I see myself as a polymath who loves creative problem-solving. With a relentless curiosity about how the world works, I dedicate myself to work that shapes it for the better. Technology has made our societies flourish, but I also care deeply about the more nuanced kind of human flourishing – art, wellness, and unlocking individual possibilities.

I’ve worked in UI/UX since I was 19 (first as an UX lead at a startup backed by Alibaba). I’ve also worked in foresight and business consulting, economic research, writing, community-building, etc. 

I write on Substack, you can find more of my thoughts and values there: [https://substack.com/@ericahu](https://substack.com/@ericahu) 

And my LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/erica-hu/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erica-hu/) 

On the agenda

* Currently fundraising for seed round ($500k) with some commits
* Beta 2.0 is launching at the end of July!
* Partnerships on the horizon
* We also have a podcast, and I’m building more quality content for Glia
* Co-working space at LSE GenDen (for alumni founders)
* …

It’s been quite a journey as a solo founder – lots to celebrate, but lots more to strive for, but imagine how much we’d accomplish as a dream team :)

I don’t usually do this, but I think I’ve finally hit my “main character meltdown” arc and need to put this somewhere other than my group chat.

Also, Charlotte Dobre — if you’re reading this:
Hiiii queen!!! 💕
Congrats on your engagement! You looked absolutely stunning — the dress, the energy, the glow?? Literal perfection. Wishing you and Mike a lifetime of love, laughter, and endless good vibes 🧿 💍✨

Okay. Back to my corporate horror movie.

So I used to love working.

Having a routine, getting dressed, being independent — I truly enjoyed all of it. But since joining this company, work feels less like a job and more like a weird simulation designed to destroy me emotionally.


Let’s talk about the people.

No one talks about actual tasks. Instead, the focus is 24/7 on everyone’s personal life. I’ve had coworkers say:
	•	“Why are you quiet today?”
	•	“You didn’t go out this weekend?”
	•	“Who were you texting during lunch?”
	•	“Why don’t you share more?”

Like… am I on a payroll or a reality show?

Then I start setting healthy boundaries, and suddenly I’m labeled “cold,” “secretive,” “stand-offish.” Apparently, not trauma bonding over stale office coffee makes you suspicious now.

Enter: The Rich Girl Narrative™ (that I didn’t ask for)

So I live in a nice apartment complex. Not a mansion, not a penthouse — just a decent place with solid lighting and functioning plumbing.

Coincidentally, my best friend at work (let’s call her Sunshine, because that’s what she has been) lives there too. We met at the office, clicked immediately, and then found out we’re neighbors. It was fate. She’s my work soulmate.

But the second people here found out where we live?

Instant villain arc.

The passive-aggressive comments started flying:
	•	“Must be nice living there.”
	•	“You probably don’t need this job anyway.”

Like… if I were actually rich, do you think I’d be working HERE??
In Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, and Outlook — all open in BROWSER TABS — on Microsoft Edge???

I’ll attach a picture. It’s as painful as it sounds. I feel like I’m doing data entry on a 2005 school computer.


The LinkedIn Surveillance Era

I liked a competitor’s post on LinkedIn — just a like — and I got warned.

Warned.

Apparently we’re not supposed to interact with anything or anyone that isn’t part of “the company.” It’s giving stalker. It’s giving “we monitor your free time.” It’s giving you need therapy and a hobby.

And since Sunshine left the company (yes, she got a way better job next door 🥹), I’ve now been unofficially advised to “limit contact” with her.

Limit contact??? That’s my neighbor. My ride-or-die. My serotonin provider.
To which I said (very calmly, very professionally):

“Absolutely not. You don’t own me.”


And HR? A whole subplot.

On my first day, the HR lady looked at my ring and told me:

“We have a dating policy. No relationships in the office.”

Cool. Makes sense, I’m married.

But then she said:

“Still… if you ever have bad days in your marriage and want someone else, just don’t do it here.”

????

Girl what?! That’s not policy — that’s a red flag wrapped in an HR blazer.

And yesterday, one of my new friends was literally crying at her desk — while HR sat right next to her gossiping. Not helping. Not checking in. Just… gossiping. Like the office TMZ.


Let’s talk about the FEVER.

Every time I enter this building, I start burning up. Head pressure. Body aches. Nausea. Like my body is physically rejecting the energy of this place.

And the second I step outside? Poof. All symptoms gone.
I genuinely think something is cursed. Like someone saged the office in reverse.


So… am I overthinking?

Because this is what I’m dealing with:
	•	I’m being watched on LinkedIn
	•	I’m not allowed to speak to sunshine — my literal neighbor
	•	HR is acting like a gossip blog
	•	People think I’m “too rich” to be there
	•	I get fevers just from entering the building
	•	And I’m working out of browser tabs in 2025

If your job doesn’t track your social media, doesn’t restrict your friendships, and lets you use actual apps — count your blessings.

I’m out here surviving on sarcasm, caffeine, and picture of my browser-based misery.

Thanks for reading. And again —
Charlotte — if you’re here, hiiii again 💕
You’re doing God’s work. If you ever want stories for a workplace horror series… I got a full season.

Love,
Your not-rich, LinkedIn-watched, browser-tab-survivor,
🖤

1m7jhe5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7jhe5,July Trip Report: Older Family (itinerary and cost included),"First, thank you to several of the people in this sub for posting helpful content, and for responding to the few posts I made before my trip! I’ve traveled to over 50 countries and I’m a big planner. Only recently have I discovered the wealth of information and knowledge Reddit has to offer in terms of trip planning!

Some background on our travel: 
This was my third trip to Iceland! The first in January 2014, the second in August 2021. I was traveling to celebrate my mom’s 60th birthday with my wife (we’re in our 30’s), my parents (in their 60’s), and my sister and her boyfriend (in their 20’s). My wife, dad, and sister have all been to Iceland once before. My mom and my sister’s boyfriend have never been. This presented an interesting planning challenge for me, as I wanted to give the first timers a great experience with some of the biggest/most popular highlights, while not being too repetitive for myself or the others who have been before. We also all had fairly limited budgets (teachers, nurse, retired firefighter- not wealthy haha), but did splurge for this special trip a bit. I decided to do parts of the south coast and the Golden Circle before ending in Reykjavik. 

Cost:
Our pre-trip expenses include round trip flights from NYC, all hotels, car rental (a 9 person van from Blue Car Rentals), and all (multiple) excursions. The cost per person totaled $2,144 USD for the 8-ish day trip (I’m quite proud of this, as months before booking I gave cost estimates for several destination options for this trip - I came within $100 of my estimate, only going over because my family decided they wanted to ATV!). 

Once on the trip, we spent an additional ~$330 USD (total, so $55 per person) on gas and parking fees. The food cost was roughly around $150-$200 USD per person. We went out to eat at least once per day (but often hot dogs or fries - we have picky eaters in the group), and made multiple grocery store stops to buy sandwiches or prepackaged food to have on the go. Every hotel except the first one had free breakfast. 

Itinerary:
July 4th: Depart

July 5th: Arrive
- Breakfast at Aura Hotel while we waited for everyone to arrive (walkable from airport)
- Rental car pickup 
- 11 AM Blue Lagoon for a few hours 
- Grocery store stop for dinner/snacks

Hotel: a wonderful apartment in Keflavik called IQ Apartments 1. The apartment was huge, clean, inexpensive, and the perfect spot for our first night. No included breakfast, but free parking. 

(Note: everyone overall liked the Blue Lagoon, but I can confidently say after three times I feel no desire to return. It was very crowded in the locker rooms, the drinks were unexciting, and even though we did three face masks we had to wait in line for the fresh water to wash off each one. The amount of kids also made it harder for me to relax. My first experience back in early 2014 was amazing but this time around, just mediocre.)

July 6th: 
- Stop at Týnda Bakaríið for coffee 
- 11 AM Lava Tunnel Tour (standard 1 hour)
- Hike Fagradalsfjall Volcano (parking lot 1, hiking trail A)
- Drive to Selfoss
- Dinner at Old Dairy Food Hall
- Ice Cream at Groovis
- Check into hotel
- Night visit to Kerid Volcanic Crater

Hotel: Selfoss Hotel, a perfect location with included parking and a large included breakfast selection. My parents’ room had a lovely view of the bridge and water!

(Notes: the cafe was tiny and lovely, a quick find on Google Maps. 

The Lava Tunnel tour was something recommended to me on Reddit as an activity most people might miss their first time in Iceland - it was a BIG hit with our entire group, and something I wouldn’t have thought to do without the recommendation. You get headlights and helmets and optional walking sticks, which was good for my mom who is a little uneasy about hikes. The guide was funny and informative- we learned a lot!

The volcano hike was a little tricky to figure out, and I’m sure now more so with the most recent eruption. Our group is not the most physically active, and with my parents being older, we only did about half of trail A, but it worked out perfectly. We saw remnants of previous eruptions super close up, and although it was steep in some areas, it was not nearly as steep as the first time I hiked it in 2021 (on a different trail) and we also approached the site fairly quickly (not the mile or so of flat nothingness I had seen previously). 

Old Dairy Food Hall was packed! The food was okay, but allowed everyone to explore different options. Groovis Ice cream was crazy! They are giant, sugary masses of ice cream with cotton candy. 

Kerid was a first for all of us, a fairly quick stop with really cool nighttime views. We were there around sunset, 11PMish, and the lighting was awesome.)

July 7th: Island Day
- 12 PM ferry to Heimaey (with the car)
- Puffin Lookout
- Eldheimar Museum
- The Viking Town
- Pitsugerdin Pizza (we got a discount from The Viking Town)
- 8 PM Ferry back to mainland 

Hotel: The Drangshlid Inn in Skogar (we stayed here for three nights). Simple but relatively cheap place, close enough to Vik and many other sights. Parking and breakfast included, and the dining area is large, lovely, and always clean despite being open for communal use 24/7 (people stored food in the small fridge, coffee/tea/hot chocolate always available for all). 

(Notes: Heimaey was a first for everyone, including me, and we loved it! An excellent place to see Puffins and it was extremely easy to get around with a car. After seeing the puffins, the ferry was my second favorite part of the day! Only about a 40 minute ride, we got great views and I enjoyed having coffee while watching the island get closer and closer. It was tiny, but my wife absolutely loved The Viking Town and reading about the mythology-based history of the island. It was also cool that they include some food and vodka samples in the price of the ticket! I would have liked to spend more time walking the lava field, but it got rainy towards the end of the day and we ended up spending about 30 minutes just waiting in the car for our ferry back.) 

July 8th: Waterfalls
- Skogafoss (& a brief hike up)
- Mia’s Country Van for lunch
- Seljalandsfoss and Gljufrabui 
- Dinner at The Soup Company 
- 9 PM Lava Show in Vik (with behind the scenes tour afterwards)

Hotel: The Drangshlid Inn in Skogar (night 2)

(Notes: It was nice to have a slower morning with fewer timed events. Staying outside of Vik also made it very easy to see these waterfalls and then return to our hotel to change out of wet clothes right away before heading into Vik for dinner! My mom was very excited about (and happy with) The Lava Show. We knew it would be extremely unlikely to see lava otherwise so booking these tickets allowed us to safely get up close with real lava (from the 1918 Katla eruption). The behind the scenes tour was cheap and worth it - it was informative, interesting, and the people were very nice!)

July 9th: Black Sand
- 10 AM ATV tour of plane wreck and black sand beach
- Coffee at Skool Beans
- Crepes at Crepes.is 
- Reynisfjara Beach 
- Black Crust Pizza
- Solheimajokull Glacier 

Hotel: The Drangshlid Inn in Skogar (night 3)

(Notes: The ATV tour was a huge hit with everyone, including my mom who was nervous about driving (she eventually rode with my dad and I took over her ATV instead of riding with my wife), and myself who only drives a car once or twice a year. I had wanted to see the plane wreck for awhile, but didn’t feel it was worth a long and boring hike, so the ATV tour was a good way to check it off the list. The beach and countryside riding was also a lot of fun!

Skool Beans was so incredibly cute, even though we didn’t get to see the cat! I got a Cucumber White Hot Chocolate and it was absolutely amazing! Crepes.is was expensive for crepes, but they were good and the little crepe stand was also cute. 

At Reynisfjara we not only saw the black sand beach and cliffs, but also puffins (from a distance)! 

Black Crust Pizza had an insane line, but it went quick and even though it’s a hyped up tourist spot, the pizza was still good and filling. 

It was around 10 when we saw the glacier and very few people were around. We actually heard part of the glacier cave and crack off, and a local who was also there said it was rare to see!)

July 10th: Golden Circle
- 11:45 AM Geothermal Bread Tour at Fontana Geothermal Baths 
- 1 PM swim at Fontana
- Ice cream at Efstidalur Farm
- Bruarfoss Waterfall
- Check into our Yurts
- Gullfoss Waterfall
- Geysir

Hotel: Nattura Yurtel, where each couple had their own yurt that included a private toilet! I can’t believe how easy, and again relatively cheap, these were to book. The yurts were so nice, spacious, a comfortable temperature, and situated in a perfect location with included parking. For dinner we drove to a restaurant 2 minutes away (although we could have walked if we weren’t sight seeing after dinner), and for the rest of the evening we enjoyed nature! The showers and shared bathrooms were very clean, and the included breakfast was also lovely. I’m sad we only spent one night!

(Notes: Fontana was another first for everyone, and I really enjoyed it. It’s fairly small and I was disappointed the lake was closed (I’m assuming due to nearby construction) for swimming/cold plunge, but the bread tour was quick and interesting to see. Since it was a slow day, they didn’t limit us to the two hours allotted with our ticket, but we didn’t spend much more time than originally planned (although we spoke to someone who had been there all day!). We got drinks and chilled out for a bit, and the locker room was a notably better experience here than at Blue Lagoon. 

The ice cream at the farm was a great stop. We all enjoyed seeing the cows and some Icelandic horses up close!

Bruarfoss was my mom’s favorite waterfall because of the blue color. She enjoyed it more than Gullfoss! We saw the Geysir area around midnight, which was great because there were no tour buses of tourists. There were, however, some scientists making observations and chatting with people about their work!)

July 11th: Reykjavik / Departure
- Bru Horse Farm (bring coins for horse candy to feed the horses)

This is where my wife and I left the rest of our family for a weekend in Nuuk, Greenland! We took the Flybus from Reykjavik and flew with Icelandair to get there. The rest of them stayed behind and saw:
- Hallgrímskirkja Church
- Cafe Loki
- Penis Museum 
- Hus Mals og Menningar (bookstore bar)

July 12th: Departure


After returning from Greenland, my wife and I spent one night at Hotel Reykjavik Centrum. It was central to the main tourist spots in Reykjavik and a lovely hotel, although I really only spent the money on it because I had a travel credit through my credit card. In the few short hours we have before our flight home, we went to:
- Braud & Co for pastries (honestly overrated in my opinion)
- Geocaching near Harpa (we did this throughout our trip, but this one is big!)
- Coffee at Kattakaffihusid (cat cafe)
- Shopping for nonsense / silly souvenirs

I hope sharing this might help some people out when planning their own trip! I put a lot of thought and effort into this itinerary, and had a ton of fun exploring Iceland. Out of all the places I’ve been, it’s one of the very rare places I would choose to return to over seeing somewhere completely new (I’m already thinking about how I can visit in the winter for my 4th trip!). For anyone who may be interested, I will also eventually post more detailed reviews of specific places on TripAdvisor under this same username (not a pitch - I don’t get paid for any of this haha, I just like the idea of contributing to resources I find helpful). 

Also sharing some pictures from my DSLR just for fun :)

Looked around and decided on a k6 and v60 to start of my journey. I was telling myself I would wait, but after trying an easydrip coffee I needed to have my own coffee at home. Pulled the trigger and today it all came. 
I made my first cup, a Hoffman v60 brew to start off. Dialing the grinder, weighing the beans(even adding that one extra bean to get the right weight), grinding the bunch up with some muscles. Wetting the filter, getting really exited it’s finally going to happen. Carefully pouring in steps, looking at times with one eye, grams in the other, finding my third eye to see my pouring. And after pouring it all waiting in anticipation for it the finish dripping. 

Here it was, my first home brew. And damn, it was almost tasteless XD. Clearly to little extraction, but nevertheless better than the coffee at work. Even though it “failed” I liked the process, had to stop myself making another cup to retry with finer grind settings. What a great mindful moment making coffee, and an “ah” when taking the first sip.

I don't suppress or hide anything. The ""difference"" in how I act in say, school vs in my room alone, is because school is a professional setting and it must be respected. I sit completely still, don't talk out of line, speak to the teacher respectfuly, etc.. this is not hiding or suppression of anything. It is simply being polite and professional. Everyone must do these things and it annoys me so deeply that nobody does.

And in non professional setting like a coffee shop or something, I still sit still and talk quietly because that is polite and well mannered. Not because I'm surpressing any behaviours. I value manners deeply and so I respect them.

Maybe it helps that I'm a very quiet person generally, I don't have any vocal stims (I hate any type of unnecessary noise even if I make it. It irritates me so much) and am not in groups very often and most of the times, it's purely for academic purposes and I only talk about that purpose because why would I talk about anything else. And the times where I'm with ""my friends"" I want them to stop talking so we can do activities like baking or games that I either can't do alone, or it'd be more fun and enjoyable to do in a group(if everyone obeyed the rules and didn't want to ""goof around"" for not reason)

My parents and most of my classmates have called me antisocial numerous times so I'd say those are not ""good"" traits to have but the teachers and professors love it since they always say to me/my parents when I was in highschool that I'm on the right path and that I don't get distracted from the core subject/academics with people and partys or whatever, and I always listen to them. Maybe it'll get bad after I graduate university, but, I don't really see why it would.

Slightly unrelated but my mom also calls me ""little dictator"" because of how much I want to enforce my ideas about manners and respecting the place you're at and makes fun of how I feel this will be extremely beneficial to everybody in the long run and also how I wear suits and ties and clothing that'd be considered extremely formal everywhere.

I Got out of bed, brushed my teeth, and had a cup of coffee. Booted up the pc and pulled up twitter on the side to see what amazing things people were saying about the new expansion and new portal tab they added. 

To my surprise, the community was praising the devs for the amazing job they did with the ""expansion"". Then I noticed it, I had an unread message from the main man himself, Pete Parson. It read, ""thank you very much for supporting Destiny and all the amazing devs over at bungie, none of this could've been possible without you and the constant support of our amazing community"". 

I couldn't believe it, Pete Parson himself wrote to me to say thanks, total shocker. Then out of nowhere I got a knock on my door. I went to see who it was and as I go to open the door it was him, Cayde 6, standing right in front of me, along with Colonel. He said, "" I believe... you're looking... for this"" as he handed me a signed copy of Destiny 3. 

Then the worse thing imaginable happened. I woke up in my bed and realized it was all just a dream. The new ""expansion"" in reality was just a glorified roguelike with seasonal resets and seasonal armor bonuses much like Diablo or POE. But hey at least I actually got that message from Pete telling me thanks for buying the new ""content"". 

I thanked him and he sent me a picture of himself throwing up a middle finger towards me while driving his new $300k car. What a nice guy.


Bungie is actually beyond cooked. I slowly realized that all the past seasons were just breadcrumbs leading towards what we have now with the new portal system. They decided to turn a FPS looter shooter into a roguelike shooter with barely any loot and no roguelike seasonal activity. But hey, at least we got seasonal resets and armor bonuses just like in some other roguelikes that won't matter by the time the next season rolls around.

1m7jeoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1m7jeoc/sending_a_little_hope_to_all_of_the_parents_of/,Sending a little hope to all of the parents of reflux babies!,"As a FTM, I spent too many late nights desperately reading all reddit threads that had anything to do with reflux, so here’s one from me.

To start, my son is amazing and I love him so much, but those first 3 months were brutal. He had colic and reflux. We had witching hours (plural!) every day, and he was losing literal ounces all day every day on us, on him, the house, the car seat, the stroller, the sidewalk, EVERYWHERE.

However, because he was gaining weight, we got almost no help from our doctors. So this for you if you’re like me, and desperately looking for absolutely anything else you can try.

**What worked for us:**

* Cutting tomatoes, citrus fruits, coffee, carbonated drinks, chocolate, and candy from my diet.
* Working hard to help him meet those physical milestones and build muscles–think rolling, sitting up, crawling, etc
   * Fisher Price Glow & Grow Kick Pad and Sit Me Up ftw.
* Stopped trying to breastfeed, switched to exclusively pumping.
* Burping every ounce until he could burp on his own \~4 months.
* Famotidine/Pepcid. This wasn’t night-and-day like some people say, but collectively it made a difference.
* And time, unfortunately. I know that sucks to hear. I hated hearing it. But at 7 months, right when he started to crawl and sit up, things went away practically overnight.

**Things that didn’t work for us:**

* Cutting dairy (and cows-milk protein) and soy from my diet
* Introducing solids (hello colorful spit up!)
* Biogaia probiotics
* SNOO leg lifters
* Switching bottles, anti-colic bottles, etc.
* Special feeding positions, wedge pillows for after feeds
* Prilosec/Omeprazole

I also want to say my son is fed breastmilk and we didn’t try formula, but there’s lots of good advice that that can help too!

Since things have settled with my son’s colic, and now reflux, he’s just a happier baby. He smiles and giggles and anyone who says the newborn stage is easier is not talking about you. Hang in there. I know it can feel so tough when you're in the thick of it, but there is hope. You’ve got this and things will get better!

(Oh, and just tell anyone who says “all babies have reflux” to fuck off because it’s not the same)

Since then I haven’t saw her. One morning I was with her young daughter ( was still 8) I liked a short of hers , two T-shirt and a belt it was cool so I took them. 
I apologize many times to her, my uncle , my mom (she hated me for 2years for that ), my dad. 
A year later, I brought it up again just me and her, I apologize from the bottom of my heart truly I made a big mistake and I regret it but I was young they should forgive me but …..
This is the first time I’ve seen them in three years and I’m being left out my her and her sister, it all began yesterday my brother was with me and them two we were in a mall we played pool she teamed up with my brother (they were both goooood at it) she left me with her sister. Then they played another game, I sat down because obviously they didn’t want me. In our way out my bro called me to leave. The one I stoled from was next to me, my bro and her sis were in front of us, she was acting like she was going to tickle her sister but I knew she didn’t enjoy my company and liked my bro more so I was left behind alone ✌🏻then we went to do horse riding, she asked me if I could help her remove the reins I was happy she actually talked to me but when I helped her she was actually making excuses just to go to my bro and her sis, once again we were in a restaurant my bro said he was going somewhere so we stayed just me and her in the table ONE second later she said I’m GOING !!!!! Wtf 
Today in the evening we are going out us four, my brother suggested we stayed in the house a little bit just so the weather could be cooler. Now they’re in his room her, her sister and my brother laughing, talking, etc 
Her sister was always left out and I always stayed with her but now…. 
There was this one time we were in the coffee shop her sister was going to a store just next to like next to it and she told GO WITH HER she can be lost (her sister is 25….)

Walked past him on the street (he was wearing sunglasses and a bucket hat) and was like 70% sure it was him. I went to the coffee shop he entered and approached him. Told him I’m a huge fan, love Atlanta and his music. He was genuinely one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met. Talked to me, my brother, and my mom for 10 mins about his kids, the area / restaurants, etc. 

I then approached him again about 5 minutes later when he had sat down and was talking to a friend. I didn’t want to be rude, but as someone going into film I saw this as an invaluable opportunity for advice. I asked for advice and he stopped his conversation and talked to me for another 10 minutes, unbothered and engaged. He seemed like he really cared about what he was saying. The guy he was with was a director of photography and also gave some good advice and it was cool to hear about his experiences as well. 

People say never meet your heroes but this definitely didn’t apply to Donald Glover! Such a cool guy who gave some great advice. Very approachable. Down to earth. My heart was pounding when I first approached him but he instantly made that nerve go away and it didn’t feel like I was talking to a celebrity. At the end I said “I hate to ask but can I get a picture” and he laughed and got up to take a picture with me and my brother. My mom was so blown away by how nice he was that she started listening to his music lol. All around great experience. ",45,1753300420.0,donaldglover,6,1.0,False

So I (F in my 30s) was talking to this guy (M 38) for about a week. Yesterday (Tue) in the afternoon he asked me what were my plans for the weekend, I told him I didn’t have any, and he asked to meet me for coffee Saturday afternoon (he told me he would’ve asked me out for drinks but since he is going to be babysitting a friend’s kid that night that wouldn’t work). I agreed. We kept chatting throughout the day, very normal. I think the last thing I asked him was “what are your dealbreakers?”, because he had asked me that earlier and I replied but hadn’t ask back. Well, when I opened the app again at night, with the intention of exchanging phone numbers, his name had moved to the top of the “they ended the chat” pile. My stomach sunk, I was truly looking forward to meeting this guy. TBH I’m not even sure it would be anything, but I had a good feeling, I don’t even know why, just attraction, I guess.

So, I kinda convinced myself that it was some sort of accidental unmatch, and I found his Facebook profile (he has a not very common name, so it was easy, only took me a minute) and I’m very tempted to send him a message there to make sure he unmatched me on purpose. I’ve never done anything like this, and I’m pretty sure nobody even check their Facebook messenger anymore, let alone the “requests” folder that even I didn’t realized existed until very recently. But I was excited about meeting him, and I think it will take this off my mind once and for all if I do message him, but it’s actually a really stupid thing to do, right? 

I get unmatching someone, or ghosting, before meeting for the first time. But setting up a date, and then not saying anything, just unmatch on that same day is so disrespectful. Either don’t ask me out, or tell me you changed your mind…

Its been helpful. Ive never like the plastic cup that comes with the Hot and Savory meals as you have to stir the food up which means rubbing against the plastic walls and getting (more) microplastics into your food. Its also plastic and does not hold heat in, causing some meals to hydrated well but not dry enough to enjoy.

Ive been using an a 16oz insulated coffee mug (ideus brand if your wondering) that I got off amazon. It was on sale for prime day. Yes its more, about $22 vs $5, but it keeps the food warmer, longer, and without the guess work of ""will it be done on time this time?"" and as an insulated cup, its good for tea or other hot drinks. The lid to close it is not screw down but is sealed with a rubber ring. That may or may not be your thing. But the lid has an option to open up just enough to sip from. You cant stack it like you can the cups but Im willing to deal with that trade off. For the rubber ring of the lid, replacement ones are only a few bucks when it goes out after a few years of use. 

The cups dont have a fill line on them as they are not made for huel. I found the right amount to fill it by simply filling the Hot and Savory cup like I normally would then dumping it into the insulated cup. I got it right the first time.

As I eat at work, I also bought a small set of metal cutlery as well with a carrying case. No need to throw away plastic cutlery every day. I can rinse everything right after use and its good for the next day. ",2,1753300232.0,Huel,1,1.0,False

I've been wrestling with the ideas of modern loneliness and disconnection, and it seems to be getting worse.

She also enjoys napping, she’s a big firm believer in naps!!! 

What she’s looking for: 
A down to earth guy with a sense of humor who’s financially established. Obviously the basic things as caring, Islamic values where both spouses can help one another in elevating their relationship with Allah swt. Someone between the ages of 30-36.

After months of late nights and probably too much coffee, I finally launched a project I've been passionate about - a completely free Pokémon knowledge quiz platform called Poké Learn.

**Why I built this:** I've been a Pokémon fan since Red/Blue, and I always loved testing my knowledge, but couldn't find a comprehensive quiz site that was both educational and safe for younger trainers. So I decided to build one with my 5-year-old son as my guide :D

**What it does:**

* Test your knowledge with different quiz types (silhouettes, type matchups, evolution chains)
* Track your learning progress over time
* Compete on leaderboards without any toxic elements
* More to be added

**It's completely free** \- no paywalls, no premium subscriptions.

As a solo developer and fellow Pokémon fan, I'd really appreciate it if you could check it out and let me know what you think. What features would make it better? What quiz types would you want to see? Any bugs I missed?

The site is [pokelearn.net](http://pokelearn.net/)

This is a fan-made project (not affiliated with Nintendo/Pokémon Company) created solely for educational purposes and our shared love of Pokémon.

Happy to answer any questions about the project and gain your feedback ofc! 🎮

Day before (part one)

I woke up early in the morning and got up right away. I was excited. Really, really excited. Tomorrow is my birthday. Tomorrow I will be eighteen and I will meet my wolf. I couldn’t wait to shift for the first time. They say it is painful, but I didn’t care about that part. It is just for a little while, and it gets easier later. I can survive a little bit of pain. 

I just wished that my parents were here to see me shift for the first time. It had been eight years since they died, and it hadn’t gotten any easier. 

They were killed in a rogue attack. 

Rogues are wolves that don’t belong to a pack. They become rogues by being exiled from their packs for committing various crimes. Some of them choose to leave their packs and live like rogues. That is rare, though. We wolves are pack animals. We don’t like being alone. When a wolf chooses to become a rogue, it is mostly because something bad has happened to them in their pack or they have lost their mate, gone crazy and left the pack. 

The rogues live alone. They don’t work with other wolves. But when they attacked our pack, they were working together. It was very odd. Since that night, our Alpha learned that there is a rogue wolf who has gathered other rogues to attack various packs. They call him the Rogue King. The attacks haven’t stopped since. They attacked our and other packs multiple times.

On the night of the attack, rogues tried to kill our Alpha’s son. We were celebrating his 18th birthday and his first shift. He was supposed to start his training to become a new Alpha and take over the pack.

However, that night, rogues killed his father, our former Alpha Luke. He was forced to become an Alpha right away. And he did an amazing job. He finished his training early and he made our pack one of the strongest ones.

My father was Alpha Luke’s Beta. He and my mom died protecting Alpha, Luna, and their son. That was their job.

After their deaths, my brother Andrew became Beta. He and our Alpha were best friends since childhood, and now they run our pack together.

My brother is an amazing Beta, and an even better brother. He was 17 when our parents died, and after that, he had to take care of our pack and me. He never complained. He took those responsibilities and did the best he could. And he did great. He always made sure I was safe and taken care of. He still does.

I finished high school a few months ago, and all I have to do now is train. After the attacks, my brother and our Alpha decided that all pack members must train to be able to defend ourselves.

The rule in our pack is that we all must go through high school. It is something similar to a human high school, but we learn werewolf and pack history, pack laws, and everything needed to help the pack function properly. For example, if a wolf is interested in working for Alpha, he or she will learn a bit more about running the pack. If a wolf is interested in agriculture, he or she will learn about plants and our crops to help sustain our food supplies. If a wolf is interested in defending the pack, he or she will learn about defense techniques, attack formations, and they will have to spend more time training than the rest of us. I chose to help the Alpha run our pack. It was natural to me. My brother is the Beta and I wanted to help him as much as I could. So, I learned all about pack laws and everything else needed to successfully run our pack.

The Alpha, Beta and pack healer are the only ones who leave the pack to go train for their positions. They go to different packs where they learn everything needed for their positions in a pack. The training lasts for about a year.

Considering our pack was attacked and our former Alpha was killed, our new Alpha and Beta finished their training in only a couple of months. The pack needed them, and it had to be done quicker than usual. I missed my brother when he left, but I knew it was something he had to do.

We have to train every day, but tomorrow I get a day off because it is my birthday and my first shift. It is a special occasion. The first shift is important because you get to meet your wolf, and your mate.

Mates are important in wolf culture. A mate is your special someone, picked by our Moon Goddess. It is the connection of two souls. Your mate becomes the most important thing to you. You love them instantly. You want and need to be with them and protect them. 

My brother still hasn’t found his mate. And neither did our Alpha. So, until he does, his mother, Gloria, still has the Luna title and does the Luna duties. 

She had a hard time after her mate, our former Alpha, passed away. She almost didn’t make it. She didn’t eat, sleep or do anything. That is what happens when you lose your mate. Your will to live goes away. However, she recovered, and she is an amazing Luna. I love her a lot. She helped me and my brother after our parents died, and she and I have a special relationship. She is like a mother to me.

I asked her to be present for my first shift. She accepted and gave me a big hug. It is a big deal to be present for a wolf’s first shift. At least in our pack. Each pack has its own tradition, but in ours, only the wolves you choose get to witness your first shift. And it was an honor to be chosen.

I chose my brother, Luna Gloria, and my friends Amy and Jacob. They were all honored and excited for me. 

I couldn’t wait to shift. It will be amazing. And maybe I will be luckier than my brother and meet my mate soon.

I had to go to training soon, so I brushed my teeth, took a quick shower, and got dressed. I put on my black tights, training bra, grey hoodie, and my black Nike sneakers. I tied my long brown hair into a ponytail and went downstairs.

Day before (part two)

I was unpleasantly surprised when I came downstairs. Sienna was standing in my kitchen looking at me like she wanted to kill me.

She is my brother’s and Alpha’s best friend. She is 25, just like my brother and Alpha, and she has been hanging out with them since childhood. Now, she is clinging on to them like they are a lifeboat. She was devastated when she found out that neither my brother nor Alpha were her mates. That didn’t stop her from trying to become Luna. She is always around Alpha, proving herself and trying to convince him to take her as his chosen mate.

Werewolves can do that. If their mate dies or they don’t find their true mate, they can take a chosen one. It is frowned upon, especially in our pack, because we take mates very seriously. Most packs do, actually. But some have a milder attitude toward chosen mates.

Sienna was tall, blonde, and perfect. Her make up was always on point. Her hair was always combed and styled to perfection. But she destroyed all that with the way she behaved. She was bitchy, mean, and disrespectful. She hated me and treated me like I was trash. But only when we were alone. When we were around my brother or Alpha, she was a totally different person. She was nice to me, and she once told my brother that I was like a little sister to her. Yuck. I tried telling my brother about her, but he didn’t believe me. He told me I was jealous of her and how much time they spent together. 

“Sienna.” I said coldly and grabbed a mug from a cupboard.

“Good morning, ugly.” she said and smirked. “It must be good to sleep as long as you do.”

“Maybe you should try it to.” I said as I poured coffee into my mug. “You need as much beauty sleep as you can get.”

I turned towards her with a smirk on my face. She was pissed. 

“You little bitch.” she said through her teeth. “I will become Luna soon and I will exile you so soon you will not be able to blink.”

She always did this. She threatened to exile me when she would become a Luna. I knew she would actually do it, and I could only hope she didn’t become a Luna.

I wanted to say something back, but I heard the front door open. My brother and our Alpha walked into our kitchen. Sienna quickly put on the biggest fake smile on her face.

I rolled my eyes. How didn’t anybody see how fake she was?

“Good morning, little one.” my brother said and kissed my forehead.

That was his favorite nickname for me. I was small, smaller than any wolf my age, and he liked to point that out. Especially because he was huge. 6’4, and had muscles all over his body, just like Alpha.

We looked a lot alike. We both had brown hair and bright blue eyes. He was more tanned than me, though. I inherited my mom’s pale complexion. I wa out in the sun all the time, but I couldn’t seem to get tanned. 

“Good morning, Andrew. Good morning, Logan.” I said and smiled.

I get to call Alpha by his first name only in the privacy of our homes. On other occasions, I must refer to him as Alpha. Or Alpha Logan. 

Sienna didn’t like that. She gave me an ‘I will kill you’ look over their shoulders. 

“Good morning, Emma.” Logan said as he sat at our kitchen table.

“What are your plans today, Em?” Andrew asked as he poured coffee for himself and Logan.

“Nothing much.” I responded. “I have a training session in an hour and then I will just hang out with Amy and Jacob.”

“Tomorrow is your first shift. Are you excited?” Logan asked me and took his coffee mug from my brother.

“Yes.” I said and smiled brightly. “I can’t wait to meet my wolf.”

“Maybe you will find your mate, Emma.” Sienna said coldly. “And maybe we will lose you to him tomorrow.” 

She gave a fake sad look to my brother. Goddess, they were so blind if they didn’t see through her act.

“Don’t worry, Sienna.” my brother said. “She will always be our little sister. No mate will take that away from us.”

I wanted to scream and throw up. She was not my sister! She was a fake bitch who couldn’t wait to get rid of me! But I couldn’t say anything, so I just gave him a fake smile.

“After your shift, you can start working at a pack house.” Logan said. “You went to high school to work at the pack office, right?”

“I did.” I said and smiled. “I can’t wait to start working.”

“Good.” Logan said and smiled.

He was handsome, even more when he smiled. And that was rare. He was usually very serious and focused only on his job as an Alpha. He always did what’s best for his pack. That was why he was so successful.

He was as tall and as muscular as my brother. Maybe even more. The alpha and beta of the pack were always the strongest wolves. And it always showed. You could always see who alpha and beta were. He had dark blonde hair and green eyes. His jaw and his nose were chiseled perfectly, and his lips looked soft. He was hot. No wonder Sienna was all over him. 

She drooled after my brother as well but being Beta’s mate wasn’t good enough for her. Although, if my brother took her as his chosen mate, she would accept that as well. She was only after the title and power. Too bad they couldn’t see that. 

A doorbell interrupted my thoughts. Jacob was here.

Day before (part three)

“Is that Jacob?” my brother asked.

I nodded and put the mug in the dishwasher.

“I will see you tonight. Goodbye, Logan. Sienna” I said and gave my brother a kiss on the cheek.

Logan smiled at me, and Sienna gave me a cold stare. Bitch.

I walked out of the kitchen and opened the front door. My friend Jacob was standing there, smiling at me.

I always had a crush on him. I still do. He is handsome, tall, muscular and has black hair. His dark brown eyes look like a pool of chocolate. And I love chocolate. Sometimes I wish he would be my mate. We would be great together, and I know he likes me. He told me himself.

We never dated or even talked about it. We saved ourselves for our mates. It isn’t forbidden to have sex with others, but it is frowned upon, mostly by our pack elders. The rest of the pack agrees that we should wait for our mates but turns away when they see someone dating outside of a mate bond. Not all of us saved ourselves for our mates, though. I know for a fact that my brother and Logan had their share of she-wolves. I think Logan even slept with Sienna, which only added to her belief that she would be his Luna. Jake and I never talked about it, but I think he slept with some she-wolves as well. 

Jacob is 22, but he still hasn’t found his mate. So maybe he is mine and I am his. I will not be happy to know that he slept around if he is my mate, but I don’t want to hold his past against him. 

“Good morning, beautiful.” he said and gave me a kiss on the cheek.

“Morning, Jake.” I said and closed the front door.

“Are you excited?” he asked and took my hand in his.

“Yes, I am.” I said with a big smile on my face. “I can’t wait to shift.”

“It will be amazing.” he said. “You will be amazing. I am really honored that you asked me to be there.”

“Of course, I did.” I said. “You and Amy are my best friends. I want you there.”

“Maybe I will be something else to you as well.” he said and winked.

I laughed. “Maybe you will.”

We walked over to the training grounds together.

Amy was already there, waiting for us. She is a year older than me, and we met at high school. She introduced me to Jacob. They are cousins.

She and Jacob look a lot alike. She has the same black hair as he does. Her eyes are a little bit lighter than his, though. 

“Well, if it isn’t my two favorite wolves.” she said and smiled brightly.

“Hello, Amy.” Jake said and gave her a kiss on her cheek.

She gave me a big hug. “I can’t wait to meet your wolf tomorrow, Emmy. Our wolves will be best friends, I just know it. Just like we are.”

“Oh, I am sure Alora will love my wolf.” I said with a huge grin.

Our wolves have their own names. Amy’s wolf is named Alora, and Jake’s is named Jared. I can’t wait to learn my wolf’s name.

“Enough chitchatting, girls. Time to train. I will see you later.” Jake said and walked over to his training ground.

Jacob works as a patrol wolf, so he trains harder and differently than us. Patrol wolves train separately from the rest of us. Amy works at a greenhouse. She is amazing with plants.

Jacob and I sometimes trained together. He taught me a little bit about what they do at their training sessions. He said he wanted me to know as much as possible to be able to defend myself. He wanted me safe.

After an hour and a half, we were done with our daily training session. Jake still had an hour left so Amy and I went home to shower and change. 

We would meet at a diner we always went to.

When I came home, Andrew was not there. He is out dealing with pack stuff. Being a Beta is not like other jobs when you work from nine to five. There is always something to do. Especially when your Alpha is Logan.

I quickly showered and changed into a pair of jeans, a white sweater and my black Converse sneakers. I dried my hair and let it fall down to my waist.

When I came to the diner, Amy was already sitting at our usual booth.

“Hey, lady.” she said. “You look amazing.”

“Thank you.” I smiled. “Not as amazing as you do.”

She is gorgeous, tall, skinny but with curves in all the right places and totally confident. All the boys want her.

“So, tomorrow is a big day.” she said, sipping her chocolate milkshake.

“Yes. I am so excited.” 

“Maybe Jake will be your mate and we will be family.” she said with a big smile on her face.

“I would love that.” I said. “You know I love Jake. He would be a great mate.”

“And he is totally in love with you.” she laughed. “Most boys are, actually.”

“What are you talking about?” I said and frowned. 

The waitress brought me my strawberry milkshake, and I thanked her before taking a sip. It is amazing.

“Come on, Emma.” she said and rolled her eyes. “You are beautiful and hot. I can’t believe you never noticed the looks you are getting. It makes Jake totally jealous.”

“I always thought they were looking at you.” I said and smirked.

Amy laughed. “Well, they do. But I am not the only one they are looking at.”

I blushed and looked down at my hands. “Well, I don’t care. I will wait for my mate.”

“And here he comes.” Amy said and pointed at the door.

Jake was walking in. He gave us a big smile and walked over to our booth. He sat down beside me and kissed my cheek.

“Hey, girls. What are we talking about?” he asked.

“Mates.” Amy said with a huge grin on her face. 

“I can’t wait to revisit that topic tomorrow.” Jake said and winked at me.

I laughed and blushed. “Okay, stop making me blush.”

Jake laughed and pinched my cheek. “Why? There is no prettier sight.”

“Okay, love birds. Enough.” Amy said and laughed. “Emma, when are we meeting tomorrow?”

“Well, I will have lunch with my brother and spend the day with him, and we will meet at the shift site at 8 pm.” I said.

My brother and I have a tradition of spending our birthdays together. No other people. Just him and me. We always have breakfast and lunch together. After that, we watch a movie and eat as much cake as we can. I love our tradition. 

“Great. I can’t wait to see if your wolf will be as small as you.” Amy said and laughed.

Jake joined her as I glared at them. “You bitches.”

“Oh, come on, Emmy.” Jake said laughing. “We love how small you are.”

I frowned but joined their laughter. 

We spent the rest of the day talking, laughing, and making plans for our first run together. 

It was late when I came home, but Andrew was still out. I quickly showered, put on my pajamas, and got under my covers. I can’t wait to see what’s to come tomorrow. 

18

‘Good morning, Emma.’

I turned towards the door to greet my brother, but nobody was standing there. I am alone. But whose voice was that?

‘It is me, silly. Your wolf.’

I flinched. Of course, it is my birthday. I got my wolf today. It is weird, though, to hear a voice inside my head.

‘You will get used to it.’ A voice said.

‘It will take some time.’ I responded.

‘We have all the time in the world.’ My wolf said.

‘What is your name?’ I asked her.

‘Eliza.’ 

‘I like it.’ I told her. 

‘I know you do, Emma. Now, get up and go spend the day with your brother. Asher has already sensed my presence, and he can’t wait to meet me.’ She said.

I got up excited and full of energy. I can’t wait to see Eliza.

I brushed my teeth, showered, and put on sweats and a hoodie. Perfect for a lazy birthday day with my brother.

When I came downstairs, Andrew had already made pancakes. It was our traditional birthday breakfast. 

“Happy birthday, Emma!” he yelled and gave me a big hug. “Asher sensed Eliza. He is so excited to finally meet his sister.”

“She can’t wait to meet him too.” I said and gave him a big smile.

I adore Asher. He is the best wolf there is. 

“Come on, let’s eat.” he said and pulled me to the table.

After we were full, we went to the living room to start our first movie of the day. We always watched the Avenger series. Humans did a great job on those movies.

At around 1 pm, Andrew and I went to the kitchen to start making lunch. On my birthday we have my favorite meal, lasagna. On his birthday, we have his favorite meal, pizza. 

I started making the lasagna while Andrew sat down at the kitchen table.

“Maybe you will find your mate soon.” he said.

“Maybe.” I said, not looking up at him. 

I don’t like talking to him about this. He is my brother, and talking about mating is weird. And I don’t want to leave him, ever. It will be really hard for me to leave with my mate.

“Maybe it will be Jacob.” he said.

I looked up at him. “Would you be okay with that?”

“Yes.” he said and shrugged. “He is one of our best warriors, so I know you would be safe with him. And I know you like him already. It would be easier for you to go with him.”

I walked over and sat beside him. “It won’t be easy for me to leave. No matter who my mate is. You are my family. I don’t want to leave you.”

“I know, Em.” he said and smiled. “I don’t want you to leave. But if you find your mate you will. And we will be okay.”

“Maybe I won’t find him.” I said and got back up. “You never did.”

“Yes.” he nodded. “But I have a pretty good feeling you will, and it will be Jacob.”

I smiled and rolled my eyes. “We will see.”

He got up and helped me finish our lunch. After we ate, we went back to the living room to watch another movie.

At around 7 pm, Andrew told me to go and get ready. We had to walk for about 20 minutes to reach the shifting site in the forest. 

It is a small clearing in the middle of the forest where all wolves go for their first shift. It is special because it is the only place in the forest where the moon can shine on you completely. Our forest is so thick that moon can barely shine through the trees. The clearing is the only place it shines freely. 

I put on my white dress, chosen especially for this night. It is tradition to wear white on the night of our first shift. I put on my shoes and went back downstairs.

Andrew was waiting for me at the door. He handed me my jacket and we left the house.

My heart was pounding in my chest. Andrew probably heard it because he grabbed my hand and pulled me closer to him.

“Don’t be scared, Emma.” he said quietly. “It will be amazing. And I will be there for you.”

“Thank you.” I said. “I love you.”

“I love you too, little one.” he said and gave me a side hug.

After about 20 minutes, we arrived at the clearing. My friends and Luna Gloria were already there, waiting for us.

Luna approached me first. “Happy birthday, sweetie. I can’t wait to meet your wolf.”

“Thank you, aunt Gloria. She is excited to meet you too.” I said with a big smile.

Amy and Jacob came towards me with big smiles on their faces.

“Happy birthday, Emmy.” Amy said and gave me a tight hug.

“Happy birthday, Emma.” Jake said and kissed my cheek. “Now, let’s meet your wolf. It is cold and I don’t want you to get sick.”

He is right. It is December and the only thing I am wearing is a dress. I do have a jacket, but it is not keeping me warm. The only reason I am not shivering is excitement.

“He is right, Emma.” Andrew said. “Give me your jacket and stand in the middle of the clearing.”

I did what he said and stood in the middle of the clearing. They all gave me an encouraging smile and turned around to give me some privacy to remove my clothes. 

I carefully removed my dress, underwear, and shoes and folded them neatly into a pile. I stood back up and looked up at the moon.

‘Are you ready, Emma?’ My wolf said.

‘I am.’ I responded. ‘How do I do this?’

‘Just let go. It will hurt. But don’t fight it. It will be over soon. Let go and give me control.’ She said.

I did what she said. I took a deep breath and let her take control of our mind and body. I started to feel my bones break. I let out a little scream and fell down on my knees.

“That’s right, Em.” I heard my brother’s voice. “It will be okay. Just let go.”

The pain was unbearable. It was like breaking all of your bones at the same time. 

I fought the urge to throw up and focused on letting go of my control.

The first shift

A few moments later, I was standing on all fours, my white fur shimmering under the moonlight. I took a deep breath and lifted my head proudly.

My friends and family turned around and gasped.

“She is white.” Luna Gloria said.

I looked at her and cocked my wolf head. Is that something special?

‘We are a pure white wolf, Emma. Nobody is a pure white wolf.’ Eliza said.

‘What do you mean?’ I asked her. ‘There are white wolves. I have seen them before.’

‘Yes. But none of them are pure white.’ She said proudly. ‘They all have a spot in a different color, or their paws are different. We are all white.’

“What does that mean?” Amy asked quietly.

“I don’t know.” my brother said, not taking his eyes off of my wolf. “But she is beautiful.”

“She is.” Jacob said quietly.

I looked at him and immediately felt disappointed. No sparks. No connection. He is not my mate.

‘We are not his.’ Eliza said. ‘We belong to somebody else.’ 

‘What do you mean, Eliza?’ I asked, surprised. ‘Do you know who our mate is?’

‘I do.’ She said. ‘You will know soon.’

‘Who is he?’ I asked. ‘How do you know?’ 

It isn’t common for a wolf to know who his or hers mate is. They only know when they see them. But not before. What is going on?

‘I am not talking to you about it.’ Eliza said. ‘Now, stop thinking about this and focus on your friends and family. Andrew is trying to mind-link you.’

I pulled my focus away from our conversation and focused on my brother’s voice inside my head. Now that I shifted, I can mind-link the entire pack.

Emma? He called me. Emma, can you hear me?

Yes. I responded. Sorry, I was talking to Eliza.

You are beautiful, Emma. He said proudly. Do you want to go for a run?

Yes! I said with excitement in my voice.

My brother told the rest of the group to shift, and we all went for a run. Eliza met all the wolves, and I could tell she loved them all. And they loved her. Especially Asher. He was attentive and careful with Eliza, just like Andrew is with me.

When I had enough, I mind-linked Andrew to tell him to go back. All the excitement and nervousness got to me, and I was tired. 

We got back to the clearing and took our clothes into our mouths. We all went behind a tree to shift and change.

Shifting back hurt as well, but not like the first time.

‘Each time we do this, it will be easier.’ Eliza said. ‘After a while, it won’t hurt at all.’

I walked back to the clearing, and my friends and family were already there. They hugged me and gave me a lot of kisses. They are proud of me and happy that I finally have my wolf. Nobody mentioned that I am a pure white again, so I just decided to forget about it. It is nothing special. I am nothing special.

Luna Gloria left first. We stayed at the clearing for a while, just chatting and laughing. After a few minutes, we started walking back.

Jacob walked beside me, and Andrew and Amy were in front of us.

“So, we are not mates.” he said with sadness in his voice.

“I guess not.” I responded, not looking up at him.

“That doesn’t mean we can’t be.” he said. “I would choose you as my mate. I love you, Emma.”

I looked up at him, surprised. But before I could say anything, my brother interfered.

“Jacob, no.” he said strictly. “At least not yet. I know you love my sister, but she is only 18 and there is a chance she will meet her true mate. If she doesn’t in a few years, and if you don’t find your mate by then, you can make her your chosen mate. If she wants to get a chosen mate. But not before she has had a chance to find her true mate.”

I looked between Andrew and Jacob. 

Jacob wanted to fight, but he knew my brother was right. I love Jake, but I deserve a chance to find my true mate.

After a few seconds of Andrew and Jake just glaring at each other, Jacob nodded and lowered his head.

“You are right.” he said quietly. “But I will wait for her.”

“I am sorry, Jake.” I said and took his hand in mine.

“You have nothing to be sorry about.” he said and gave me a small smile.

Amy was quiet the whole time, but I could tell she was sad. She really hoped Jake and I would be mates. 

We continued our walk through the forest, and soon we were back at our house. Jake and Amy said their goodbyes and went home. 

Andrew and I went back inside the house, and I looked at my watch. It was 10 pm. 

“Hey, do you want to watch another movie? It is not too late.” Andrew asked and took my jacket to put it away.

“I would, but I am so tired.” I said.

He smiled. “Yeah. The first shift will do that to you.”

“I will just go to bed.” I said. “Thank you for today. I loved it.”

“I loved it too, little one.” he said with a big smile. “Asher and I love your wolf.”

“We love you too.” I said and smiled.

I walked upstairs, and Andrew went to the living room.

I hopped in the shower and put on my pajamas. I got under the covers and closed my eyes immediately.

I don’t think I slept long when I was awoken by a loud knock on our front door.

Mate

I looked at my watch and saw that it was 11 pm. Who was here this late?

I removed the covers and went toward my bedroom door. I opened them in time to hear my brother’s voice.

“Logan?” he said. “What are you doing here?”

“Where is she? Where is Emma?” Logan asked nervously.

His voice was the most amazing sound I have ever heard. It was like music to my ears. What was wrong with me? It never sounded like that before. It must have been because I was tired.

But he sounded cold, rushed. I didn’t know why he was asking for me, but I had a feeling that I was in trouble. But I didn’t do anything wrong. 

“Emma?” my brother asked. “She is sleeping. Why?”

I could hear surprise and confusion in his voice.

I started walking toward the stairs and was instantly hit with the most amazing smell, pine needles and snow. It smelled like a winter forest.

‘Mate!’ Eliza screamed in my head.

‘What?!’ I asked and froze. 

‘It is Logan, Emma. He is our mate. Go to him.’ Eliza said, excited.

Logan? The Alpha? He is my mate? I am a Luna? 

I had a million questions in my head. My feet started moving against my will. It was like something was pulling me downstairs. Well, not something. The mate bond. 

“Wake her up.” Logan growled. “Now.”

He sounded mad. Why was he mad?

“I am awake.” I said and started walking down the stairs.

I stopped in the middle to look at Logan.

Everything shifted when I looked into his eyes. He was now the center of my world. He was everything. I felt this incredible need to touch him, to be in his arms. 

I wanted to run to him, but I stopped myself when I saw how cold his stare was. What was going on?

“Logan?” my brother called him.

“She is my mate.” Logan said through his teeth.

My brother gasped and looked up at me. I nodded and looked back at Logan. He was standing there looking at me with a cold expression on his face. His fists were clenched, and his posture was rigid. 

He didn’t want me. That’s why he was so angry. I was not good enough to be his Luna. 

“Emma.” Andrew called my name. “Go to your room. Now.”

He must have seen how angry Logan was and wanted to talk to him about this. I turned away and walked back upstairs. 

But there was no way I was going back into my room. I wanted to hear what Logan would say. I had a feeling I knew, though. 

I heard them walking to the kitchen, and I sat at the top of the stairs. I would be able to hear them talk and, hopefully, they would be focused on their conversation and would not be able to hear or sense me. I just had to be very quiet.

I hugged my knees and waited.

“Talk.” my brother said coldly. “How did you know before you even saw her?”

“I don’t know.” Logan sighed. “I could sense and smell her. It happened about an hour ago. At first, I thought I was going crazy, but then I decided to follow that smell. I knew for sure when I came closer to your house. Leon started going crazy.”

“That is weird.” my brother said. “Mates usually know when they see each other. They can’t sense it before.”

“I know. But I did.” Logan growled.

My brother sighed. “Why are you angry?”

“She can’t be my Luna, Andrew.” Logan said.

My heart broke. I hugged my knees even tighter. I felt warm tears running down my cheeks. Nothing hurts like your mate’s rejection.

“What? Why?” my brother asked angrily.

“She is a child.” Logan said. “She is not strong enough to be a Luna. I need someone stronger.”

“You are kidding me, right?” my brother yelled. “You are going to throw away Goddess’ gift because you don’t think she is strong enough?!”

“It is for the pack.” Logan said calmly. “You know our pack needs strong leadership. Especially now that rogues are attacking even more frequently.”

“Alpha is always stronger when he has his Luna by his side.” my brother growled.

“He is. And I will have my Luna.” Logan said. “I am thinking about taking Sienna as my chosen mate.”

My heart stopped beating. He was choosing another she-wolf instead of me. And not just any wolf. Sienna. She wanted to get rid of me. And she will. She will become a Luna and she will exile me from my pack. Maybe she will even kill me when she finds out I am Logan’s true mate. 

“Why didn’t you already do that if you think she will be a great Luna?” my brother asked angrily.

“I wanted to wait for my true mate.” Logan answered. “To see if I was gifted with a strong she-wolf. But now that I see that is not the case, I can freely choose somebody else.”

“I can’t believe this.” my brother said quietly.

“You know I am right, Andrew.” Logan said. “You know that you, me, and Sienna will be great leaders, and the pack will benefit greatly from our leadership. We can’t do that with your sister. She is only 18.”

My brother said nothing, and I think he agreed with Logan. He thought that I was not strong. I didn’t think my heart could break even more. 

I’ve heard enough. I got up and walked to my room. 

My heart was breaking into a million tiny pieces. I didn’t think that I would ever be able to put it back together. And he hasn’t officially rejected me yet. I didn’t know how I would survive when he does.

Mates can reject each other. It doesn’t break the bond, though. Nothing does. It is only words. But it lets you know that your mate doesn’t want you, and it is horrible. The bond is alive, but you can’t do anything about it. 

Being exiled by Sienna and becoming a rogue suddenly didn’t sound so bad. It was better than staying here, watching them together. It would kill me slowly. 

‘Eliza?’ I called my wolf. ‘Are you okay?’

‘No, Emma.’ She whined. ‘I am in pain.’

‘I know.’ I said. ‘I am sorry.’

‘His wolf wants us.’ She whined. ‘Leon wants us. It is Logan who is fighting the bond.’

I didn’t respond and I felt her going further back in my mind. I didn’t think I would hear from her again tonight. She needed to heal. 

I couldn’t stay here. I couldn’t see my brother. I couldn’t see him. 

I quickly put on my tights, a hoodie, and sneakers. I grabbed a jacket from my wardrobe and opened my window.

My room was on the second floor, but there was a roof just underneath it. I always sneaked out this way when my brother forbade me from going out with Amy. He never caught me. I hoped that tonight would be the same.

I carefully climbed out onto the roof and made my way down. I had to be really careful not to make any noise. I was in a house with an Alpha and a Beta werewolf. Their hearing was even better than other werewolves’. I just hoped they were still talking and focused on their conversation. 

I climbed down and started walking toward the forest. There was a cave nearby where Amy, Jake, and I always went to hang out when we wanted to be alone. I needed to go there and think. 

Rejection

Logan POV

I wanted to reject her on the spot. 

But when I saw her standing there on the stairs, I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t say those words.

I saw that she was happy when she looked at me. She wanted to go to me. But she saw my cold stare and she stopped herself. 

Goddess, she was beautiful. I always thought that she was pretty and hot, but now that she was my mate, she was even more beautiful than before. She smelled like strawberries and watermelon. Her long brown hair was falling freely down her back and her blue eyes were an ocean I want to swim in. Her lips were perfect. Her small body was perfect. Every curve was made for me.

*Bernie and Guy invited the visitors to have coffee across the way in the RV Park Rec Room. CANDACE, however, saw ADIL, Coach LOLITA, and another student heading toward the school. She decided to wait for them and hear straight from the horse’s mouth how everything went.*

CANDANCE: So, how did it go in the Pool?

ZOEY: Hi, my name is ZOEY. ADIL is a great swimmer! No matter how many times we challenged him to race us, he beat us again and again. We thought we’d get him tired out, but we were the ones who got tired!

CANDACE: Is this true, ADIL? *(silence from his end, but a sheepish “yes” nod)*

LOLITA: Don’t be modest, ADIL! *(To CANDACE)* He is a great swimmer and I’m glad you started him swimming at an early age. ZOEY is our top girl swimmer in the fourth grade and I asked her to join us here. When I look at them, I see future Olympians! But they need training!

ZOEY: I know what you are going to say next, Coach. You are going to quote the Bible, ""To whom much is given, much is required."" Then you are going to give us quotes ([sample](https://motivationmaze.com/mickeys-advice-to-rocky/)) from Rocky’s trainer Mickey.

ADIL: Who’s Mickey? Who’s Rocky?

ZOEY: OMG! OMG! OMG! 

LOLITA: Don’t let ZOEY spook you! You’ll catch up with the Rocky stuff soon enough.

ZOEY: Better watch out, ADIL, here comes the “People of Color” and the “Will to Achieve” speeches!

ADIL: What???

LOLITA: ZOEY, stop it! But actually she’s right again, ADIL. Most of the students and staff here are from the nearby indigenous community or people of color. I’m a POC, too; as you can plainly see, my skin is about as black as it gets. People like us have to work three or four times as much as DOMs.

ADIL: What are DOMs? 

LOLITA: People of privilege or folk from the dominant culture—even those without privilege. 

CANDACE: Wait a second! I don’t want my son classifying people by labels.

ZOEY: Your name is Ms. CANDACE, right?

CANDACE: Happy to meet you, ZOEY. Please call me just CANDACE.

ZOEY: I’m only ten, too, and I understand what you mean, “Just” CANDACE. But what Coach is saying is true. Every one of us knows it. And we work and study harder than anyone else. We've heard the same mantra since we started here: “The will to achieve, the will to achieve, the will to achieve.” Our teachers and friends can help us wake it up. But it really depends on us to turn the flame to high. CANDACE, won’t you consider sending ADIL to Longhouse School next year? Our classmates will help him find and feed his own flame.

CANDACE: I don’t know what to say. I was not expecting this from a student! Sure, we’ll put Longhouse toward the top of our list for schools next year!

LOLITA: We teachers cannot do it ourselves, CANDACE. Ultimately, it’s shared accountability. My mentor, Daisaku Ikeda, once spoke about a phenomenon in education he called “the flight from learning.” We need to switch that to “the flight to learning.” James Coleman’s research going back to 1966 points to needing the family, community, and peer groups to help students turn up that flame. Once lit there is nothing that can stop them!

ZOEY: Can I say something else? It’s not just swimming. Coach pushes us really hard to run, exercise, dance, and ARTICULATE in her drama plays. All the teachers push us in all of our classes. And we push each other, too. We weren’t so nice to Ms. AUDRA when she came here as a new teacher. But we worked through all of that. I think she’s our best teacher now. Oops, sorry, Coach!

LOLITA: No worries, none at all.

ZOEY: Please think about coming here, ADIL. I want a second chance to beat your ass in swimming. And in math. And reading. And community studies. And in STEM Gym. It’s OK, don’t feel bad. You can keep second place!

ADIL: (laughing). Deal’s on!

LOLITA: Thanks for being a good sport, CANDACE. But I think we ran out of things to say. ADIL, I am sure you and your parents will make the best decision for your school next year. If you decide to come to Longhouse, you can start getting ready for me with some fun swim training exercises [here](https://instaswimusa.com/swimming-drills-for-young-swimmers/#:~:text=Vertical%20Kicking:%20Have%20swimmers%20practice,muscles%20and%20improve%20kicking%20endurance).

I've lurked a lot around here, and today in therapy decided to take the dive and source some ideas.

I'm blind and spend a lot of time by myself working 1.5+ jobs, and it's starting to really mess with my mental health. I'd love to make more local friends, and am curious of ideas. My love languages are food, coffee, comedy, music, books. I'd love to do something that would be more tactile or fun; I love cooking, reading, crafting.

I gave the community thing a shot when I first moved here and I joined a makerspace. It was an amazing area and there were some cool people there, but it didn't really lend itself to being able to meet people as most there seemed to already have groups of friends and would come to work on a project, but that's the type of nerdy fun thing I was really excited about.

He says things like “I want to live with you forever” (Cries diring exchanges), tells my wife “I wish you were my real mom”, “am I a bad person because I like eating animals” , “please don’t pack sandwich today my vegan mom gets mad” (on exchange days at school for his lunch) sometimes he doesn’t finish it completely but its his favorite lunch. “My step dad says my mom cries when I leave her do you cry for me?”,

Today at the grocery store he asks what he always asks “Can I stay im the car, I said no, you can not stay alone anywhere its dangerous and you are too young” he said “cause the cops will take me away?” I said that could happen yes, but its just not good because bad things can happen and mom and I have to be there to watch over you when you are with us or them. “He said but my vegan mom (IDK why he calls her that and not just mom) always lets me stay in the car when she goes to the store”

This is going to sound paranoid but hear me out. I've been living with my roommate Sarah (22F) for about 8 months now and things were fine until about 6 weeks ago. I'm 23F btw.

It started small - she'd leave dishes in the sink that weren't mine and then text me asking when I was going to clean ""my mess."" Then she started having really loud phone calls at like 11pm right outside my bedroom door. When I asked her to keep it down she was like ""this is the living room, I can talk wherever I want.""

Last week she told me her boyfriend Mike needs to stay here ""temporarily"" because his lease is up. I said okay thinking it would be a few days but he's been here every single night and they're basically treating me like a third wheel in my own apartment. They take over the living room, eat my food from the fridge, and yesterday I caught Mike using my coffee maker without asking.

We went to the same dealership my wife's car is/was leased at but a different manufacturer, same building, same service bay. The trade-in was in good shape, was under miles, and I still owed a few payments, but the dealership was sending mailers to bring it in to get us into something new. So we go to test drive the SUV we wanted, **a 2025 model.** I told the salesguy ""we are trading in our lease"" and put down a deposit on the SUV trim/color we wanted, it was in the next state they'd have it in tomorrow. Okay, tomorrow comes, ""We got the car in but its the wrong color/trim"" ""Oh and by the way the price is more because we could only get a 2026 in that color/trim."" I should have walked right then. Then it was back and forth to get to a price I could live with, okay... and we aren't going to get the SUV until Saturday *I will drop it off at your home*.!"" Deal (it's a little more than what I was hoping but still fair) I did all the lease paperwork online... **and you are taking the Subaru?** ""Yes"" OKAY ***here is where I fucked up***. I should have pressed them more on the trade in.

Saturday comes, we're busy doing family stuff, car is coming at 3pm. Salesman calls to drop off the new car and he'll take back the trade-in... Hands me an envelope, shows me and my wife the car... cool. Next morning I'm having a coffee and reading through the lease deal to make sure they didn't miss anything... Um there is NOTHING FOR THE TRADE IN. AND NO DEALER INCENTIVES APPLIED  Nothing at all, they took the keys, took the car... And I feel like a chump...

I didn't sleep Sunday night, Monday morning I call the salesguy and ask about the trade-in. ""I gave the keys to the lease manager next door."" So you never coordinated with them? ""Well, no"". When the price went up I figured it was because maybe the trade in wasn't as even as I thought it was and I had to make up the difference. NOPE, they just gouged me on the sales price and then took my car, and now I have to make $2500 in lease payments + the new car lease payments.

Salesguy is in the Hospital, sales manager finally got back with me ""Our used car division is only valuing your car at  $20,000 (as they have the same one on their lot with double the miles for another $7500). I said ""Can I please have me car back?"" If I'm going to be making payments I want the car. We can't do that it has already gone to auction!!!???? WTF!!!!! We are working on it, the most you may have to pay is $1000, but I'm trying to resolve it with management so you don't owe anything more.

I then decided I was going to see him the next day. Morning came and I had a few signs that today I HAD to see him no matter what!

1. First thing is I go to make a coffee (I was out!) Then asked my neice before she went to school (lives next door) if she had any coffee... nope they only had tea... My Dad drank tea religiously.
2. A single magpie appeared on my fence and started skwawking so loudly it made my sister call the hospital to see how he was. For me that magpie was shouting ""go and see him!""
3. I couldn't get a coffee anywhere until I got halfway!
4. One of the stops (took a train) was Petersfield (Dad's name is Peter)

Got to the hospital and stayed for 3+hrs with him, made my way home got there about 9pm, then got a call at 11:26pm saying he'd passed 😭😭😭

Sweets are rare and all soda I drink are zero sugar versions. Ice creams are very rare for me too, but I want to fully get rid of sugar now to eliminate risk.

Lunch - soya chunks/paneer fried rice + 1 omelet/bacon 
Dinner - 250gm or 120gm sauted chicken + whatever random dinner (there is no routine for last meal)

This research shows that **psilocybin may directly influence cellular regeneration and longevity**, unlocking new paths in the quest for human vitality and mental wellness.

The study suggests that **psilocybin, when microdosed consistently, can activate certain neural and cellular pathways associated with mitochondrial rejuvenation and stress resistance;** core components of what we understand as “biological youth.” This reinforces Matrix Genetix’s belief that the mushroom is not just a medicine, it’s a **key to unlocking our fullest, longest, and most vibrant lives**.

“We’ve always said mushrooms don’t give you visions, they clear the static,” said a Matrix Genetix spokesperson. “Now science is catching up. This is no longer fringe. This is the future of well-being.”

In response, Matrix Genetix will fast-track a new wave of psilocybin-enhanced biohacking products, including:

* Microdose stacks targeted at cellular longevity
* Morning vitality mushroom coffees
* Psilocybin + NAD+ Immortalis capsules
* Mood + mitochondrial blends built for daily clarity and regeneration",1,1753298179.0,matrixgenetix,0,1.0,False

1m7ib25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m7ib25/what_do_i_do_about_my_roommate/,What do i do about my roommate,"Sorry in advance for the lengthy post. In January i (20f) moved in with my roommate (20f) , we were good friends before & she seemed very clean and normal. Before we moved in we laid some boundaries about cleaning up after ourselves and i told her i was going to get cats and if she wasnt okay with kitties we probably shouldnt room together. She said she was a super clean person and was totally cool if i got cats. 

Fast forward a month and i came to realize shes very dirty, never clean the counters when she spills crumbs, never does dishes or rinses them off before letting them sit, her coffee brewer is constantly moldy, never vacuums or cleans any appliances. Not to mention i've boughten us every single cleaning product as well because she just never does it. At the time she had a more busy work schedule than me so i cleaned everything for the both of us. 

Then it only got worse, she invited friends over to play on my pole in MY room while i was at work constantly despite me asking her thousands of time not to, i get paid in cash and its all stored in my room that shes inviting strangers into, she even lied one time and said she didnt while her bf at the time told me she wasnt telling the truth and definitely did let them in my room. Not only did she ignore me all those times but even knocked my pole out of place??? I had to get a lock on my door and lock it from the outside because she wouldnt stop. Which she got mad about me doing, She then brought over people to our pool and they all got too drunk, broke glass, and threw up all over the pool area which violated our lease and resulted in a pretty hefty fine against us. STILL i gave her the benefit of the doubt. 

Recently though im at my last straw, on top of her messy life she has just become a bad friend. She stopped caring about me personally or asking how i am and only came to me to rant about which boy is making her mad this time, shed cry or complain to me, id comfort her, give her advice, shed ignore my advice and the cycle would continue. She started treating me like a therapist and weirdly always had something super urgent every time i go see my boyfriend. I mean like 5+ calls a night if i left to spend time with him. If i picked up the phone it was something so minuscule or about a boy, and my boyfriend pointed out that it seems like shes doing it on purpose to disrupt our time together. Idk how true that is though. 

Then she gets this ""boyfriend"" and basically moved him in. Hes here 5+ days a week, even when shes not home, hes just as messy as she is, hes used my bathroom (#2) and didnt flush?, he left a rotting watermelon on our counter and sticky juice got everywhere, our power bill has DOUBLED, and i constantly hear them having intimate time. The last one i can excuse if its once in a while but its 3+ times a day to a point where im uncomfortable even being in my living room cuz its even louder in there. She also yells about their sex life or his masturbation habits with the door wide open and i hear everything. 

I asked to go out with her one night cuz i was building alot of resentment towards her and started to feel bad, i figured a fun night out might help. But then when we get to the bar she proceeded to call me a bitch for not talking to her anymore and claim im always with my boyfriend (i see him maybe twice a week) while hers practically lives here, and says im either doing that or with my own friends, trying to say ive been completely ignoring her recently. I admittedly started brushing off her boy drama and didn't entertain the 1 hour rants any longer but i certainly didnt ignore her. I find it hard to get a conversation in with her anyways cuz her man is ALWAYS here.

Then she started locking my cats in my room when im not home despite her saying shes fine with them and me telling her they really shouldn't be locked in there. Now she's completely ignoring me and i believe its because i asked her and her boyfriend if they could have their intimate conversation with the door closed, that or that she overheard me talking about being excited to live with my boyfriend instead. She also has no job now and only sits at home so im not sure how she plans on paying rent, or why she cant clean up after herself with all the free time she has. We have 8 months of our lease left and i truly dont know what to do. Ive talked to her so many times about these things before and she just gets mad at me for the next week if i say anything critical to her, even if i say NOTHING to her at all then shes mad cuz ""i dont talk to her anymore""

Should i break my lease or should i suck it up. Or is there some other answer i could be missing to get her to finally respect that this is my space as well. 

Edit to add: I do still love her, she was a really good friend and sometimes (very occasionally) we will have fun or cute conversations. I dont think all these things she does are 100% coming from intention or animosity, i think alot of it comes from ignorance. And also we live in a very large apartment complex ",4,1753298063.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I can’t say whether or not it helped me because I hadn’t noticed any difference. I started it close to a time when things were changing in my life such as returning to school in the fall. After a few months, I told my doctor I don’t think it’s working so she gave me Bupropion (Wellbutrin) to take alongside it. Again, I didn’t notice any significant difference to want to continue taking it. After trying that, I was doing some research on ADHD in women as I thought maybe I was treating the wrong thing. Some of the signs resonated with me - specifically Binge Eating Disorder as it is something I have struggled with on and off. So, my doctor started me on a low dose of Vyvanse - starting from 15mcg now up to 30mcg. The only thing I noticed with this was the first couple days I felt oddly calm and like I wasn’t in a rush for anything. After taking it for a few months, now I just find it makes me less hungry and a little more wired like if I drank coffee.

To tie it back, I have been struggling for years with anxiety and reoccurring depression, but it never seemed as bad as this past year. I don’t think I’ve ever had a panic attack; I just constantly feel overwhelmed and worried about things. I find myself dealing with major mood swings because of the overwhelm. I am a very kind and overall likeable person - but I get so damn irritated. If I am stressed and someone is walking too slow or doing something that annoys me, I feel so frustrated. The only people that have really had to deal with the irritableness are those close to me such as my parents and boyfriend. I find myself apologizing often after lashing out because I was so overwhelmed by something that had nothing to do with who I was getting irritated with. Also, no matter how much I sleep, how well I eat, drink water, etc. I am ALWAYS tired. It is so bad to the point where I will skip a social gathering because I know I will be sleepy and I have to take naps almost everyday to function. It is exhausting living like this because I don’t have the energy or mood to do the things that I want to do. I have gotten my blood work done and it came back fine. 

Is this just anxiety? Or is there some mood disorder that could be at play? I feel so hopeless because I don’t want to keep trying medication since the withdrawals are rough. Any suggestions would be appreciated 🙂

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of European titans! Germany and Spain meet in a semi-final that’s as nerve-wracking as a toddler on a trampoline. Let’s break it down.

**Odds & Stats**: While no explicit odds are provided, history suggests these teams are evenly matched. Germany’s recent penalty-kick victory over France (6-5 after a 0-0 draw) proves they thrive under pressure—like a coffee addict in a 24-hour race. Spain, meanwhile, dispatched Switzerland 2-0, showcasing clinical efficiency. Their defense? Tighter than a single’s dating profile.

**Injury Report**: Germany’s star striker, Alexandra Bergström, is *unharmed* but might be emotionally scarred from that penalty shootout. Spain’s captain, Irene Paredes, is fully fit and probably still dreaming about that 2-0 shutout.

**Humor Injection**: Germany’s offense is like a vegan at a steakhouse—present, but not particularly effective. Spain’s defense? A Swiss Army knife with a PhD in “How to Not Let You Score.”

**Prediction**: Spain edges out Germany. Why? Because while Germany’s “never-say-die” spirit is admirable, Spain’s disciplined attack is less likely to blow a 2-0 lead (unlike Switzerland). Bet on Spain unless you enjoy last-minute German comebacks that make your heart do the cha-cha.

**Le Mans vs. Guingamp Preseason Friendly**  
Now, let’s pivot to a match that’s less “title decider” and more “let’s see who trips over their cleats first.”

Somehow, we all naturally fell into a morning routine and managed to get out the door together without ever fighting over mirror time or shower slots. We had only known each other for a few days, but we already felt like a team.

The school day started around 9:30 a.m. We’d begin with one teacher and then switch to another mid-morning. At 11:30, we got a 30-minute break to use the bathroom or grab a coffee, but a lot of us just stayed in the classroom, chatting or helping each other fill in notes we might have missed. There was a strong sense of camaraderie from the beginning.

After our break, we had two more lessons. Our class was pretty big, so we were split into two groups to make it more manageable. One of my favorite parts of the week was Thursday — that’s when we had Czech language class with Radka. It was our first real taste of what it’s like to be in the shoes of a language learner. And honestly? It was super motivating. It helped connect the dots between what we were being taught and how it actually applied to creating lessons from scratch.  
  
Then we’d get an hour-long lunch break, usually around 1:00 p.m.  
In the first week, this was a lot more relaxed. We had time to walk over to the Palladium and have a sit down meal at the restaurants, or even heading back to the dorms for food and a power nap. Although that flexibility quickly disappeared once the real workload kicked in.

But after that first week, lunch became more like a working break. Most of us stayed in the classroom or nearby, going over our lesson plans, stressing over materials, or just mentally preparing for teaching practice later in the day.

We had to be back at the school by 2:00 p.m.  
During Week 1, this time was spent learning how to create our first lessons and working in small groups. On that first Monday after class, the school took us on a walking tour of Prague, led by the lovely Andrea, which ended at a bar where we all got drinks and received our first peer teaching assignments.

Tuesday and Wednesday, we focused on group lesson planning and presenting mini-lessons to our classmates. That helped ease us into what was coming.

Then on Wednesday evening, we got our first real teaching assignment. We were told we’d each be teaching a 20-minute lesson to a group of Czech students, they'd end up being the same students we’d be teaching for the rest of the course. (The students stayed in their assigned levels while we rotated as teachers.) My first group was level A1, and I remember being equally excited and terrified. Luckily, there was a comedian in my group who helped break the tension and made it a fun experience for all of us.

Starting Thursday and continuing throughout the rest of the course, our afternoons were dedicated to teaching practice from 2:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.  
Each of us taught a 30–45 minute lesson, followed by another trainee’s turn. We’d take notes during each other’s lessons to give peer feedback, and then after everyone finished, our observer would sit with us individually and give detailed feedback, usually for 30 to 45 minutes each, on what we did well and where we could improve.

Fridays were our breather days! No teaching practice, and we were usually done by 1:00 p.m. That gave us the rest of the day... and weekend to relax, catch up on assignments, or go explore Prague.

Let me know in the comments if you’ve taken a TEFL course! Was your daily schedule anything like this? And if you’re thinking of doing one, what do you want to know about the day-to-day?(:",3,1753297609.0,teachinginprague,2,1.0,False

This struck me as a highly anticipated book, due to how must advertising there was for it at Barnes and Nobles, much like when Onyx Storm (Empyrian book series) first released.

What I remember from the cover of this book was that it was a paperback cover, and the front was a pretty colorful background with an illustration of a guy and a girl. Based on what I have found online, this is a very popular front cover style for romcom / romance fiction books written for YA.

The only detail I remember from the actual story was from the first page, since I did not purchase this book, was describing the setting of the story and the beginning of what I assume to be the main character's love story.

The female main character, whose name I do not know, worked at a coffee shop as a barista or waitress, when she saw the cute boy from her 11th grade english class (pressumed love interest) walk inside the store. Another detail that I remember was that when the boy walked in, autumn leaves followed, seemingly from the recent fall season in the setting of the story.

Details about the boy specifically being in an 11th grade english class, indicating that they are high schoolers, leads me to believe that this is most likely a romcom or romance novel for young adults, despite me not knowing other details of the story. If I had to guess a page number count, I would estimate between 150-350 pages, with the letters being decently big, so it was a fairly short story. I am not sure if this was part of a book series, maybe the beginning of one, but it leads me to believe it might have been due to all the advertising and promoting.

The language of the original book is English and the Barnes and Nobles was in the U.S.

Thank you for your help, and I am sorry for the ambiguity. If there are other subreddits that can better help me find this book with the amount of information I have, please indicate them to me. Thank you!",2,1753297585.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False
1m7i3f6,https://v.redd.it/965jaxht6oef1,I electrified my Comandante!,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share a project I have been working on: electrifying my Comandante C40 grinder. A year ago, I gave this my first try with a decent result that has served me well until now. However, I felt that I could improve on it, so I developed this second version pictured here. The concept is loosely based on the Skope X, which is a commercially available product that essentially does the same thing. But that was too expensive (especially with shipping), and designing things is fun, so I made my own instead!

Some of the features it has:

* **Brushless DC motor:** not only are these quieter and more powerful than brushed DC motors, but they also have the ability to control the position of the motor, in addition to the speed. This enables me to use the same motor to also adjust the grind size automatically. I used a 20:1 planetary reduction gearbox to increase the torque, giving a maximum speed just north of 180 RPM. So far, I have ground coffee espresso fine (Red Clix setting 9) without any issues.
* **Automatic grind size adjustment**: In the second part of the video, you can see the immobilizing unit that snaps into place magnetically to keep the grind adjustment screw stationary. If the motor is then turned a set amount of degrees, the grind size can be adjusted. Naturally, the microprocessor keeps track of the previous grind size so you don't have to remember. Since you shouldn't be able to use the grinder while the screw is immobilized, a magnetic field sensor (Hall sensor) detects when the screw is immobilized automatically by the presence of a small magnet in the immobilizing assembly.
* **Bellows**: Some people dislike these, but I found some sort of retention minimizing solution to be unavoidable. Since the C40 is designed as a hand grinder, bean retention was not factored into the design of the grinder itself because you would naturally be shaking it around while using it under normal circumstances.
* **Adjustable Grind Speed**: Recent research has shown that grind speed affects the production of fines and ultimately the taste of the coffee in the cup. The speed is therefore adjustable from 30-180 RPM (going more slowly, the speed controller struggles to accurately control the speed).  
* **Portafilter-style locking mechanism:** Although not shown in the video, the grinder can easily be removed and used as a hand grinder via a portafilter-style locking mechanism. There is a small collar that has two prongs which lock onto the 3D-printed housing. The collar is self-tightening when pulled up (i.e. suspended), but can easily be removed by pulling it down the grinder. 
* **Screen:** The screen built into the RP2040 microprocessor shows the current grind speed, or grind size, depending on the context. There was no need to add any more complexity and a 7-segment display probably would have sufficed, but I wanted the ability to display more information in the future if I decided to give this project a software update.
* **USB-C port:** The USB-C port of the RP2040 is exposed, allowing for future software updates such as a recipe book for grind sizes, or whatever else I can think of in future.

  
I'd love to hear your feedback on the design and the features! If you are curious to recreate this project, let me know. If there is sufficient interest, I may make a how-to guide and sell you the CAD model. If you would like to buy this kind of product, also let me know please and approximately how much you would be willing to pay for it.

Jasmine and I were classmates in grad school, however, I recently decided I did not want to pursue my degree anymore, so I left. I was moving out, and had to get rid of a small coffee table, dining table, and 2 chairs, which I was planning to sell for $100. I was originally planning to post an ad for it in our class group chat. I also told Jasmine, and she offered to buy it for $70, to which I agreed (I needed it gone fast). The next day, she offered to pay for my brunch, which was $20, in a way to pay back for the furniture. (She's the only person I've met who paid me back in food/stuff. This has never fucking been the case with ANY of my friends). This happened in mid-May.

I live 6 hours away from this grad school, and weeks later, Jasmine and her bf invited me to attend a trading card convention with them. I agreed, as I've never been to one before. I knew there was an entry fee to pay. Jasmine talked to me over the phone, and said that she would take care of the $35 entry fee and I would not need to pay her back; she just wanted to see me. I drive to their city, where they host me in their apartment. She took us 3 out for dinner. When it was time to pay for the food, she said that she would pay for everyone (around $80) and I wouldn't have to worry about paying her back (around $25). The next day, we go to the convention. I paid for what I wanted, except at this one table, there was a vendor that didn't except credit card, only cash/Venmo. Jasmine gave some money to Andrew to pay $25 for my gaming cards, and I said I'd buy them food.

At lunch, I brought up paying them back for the cards. I told her she still owed me money for the furniture ($50 now), and asked if the cost of the furniture could cover the cards. She agreed. Andrew then made a remark that he thought that I gave the furniture for FREE out of the kindness of my heart. Jasmine told him then that she had agreed to buy the furniture for $70. Then she went back on her word and said that the cost of the convention entry fee would be covered by the furniture fee. I was so upset hearing this. I didn't want to ruin the moment, so I kept quiet.

Later, we decide to get ice cream, which totaled to around $50, and I paid for the 3 of us share. I paid $28 for their ice creams, which, to my understanding, would be reimbursed by Jasmine. We then got Korean BBQ, which was honestly expensive. Going into this, 1) I didn't know where we were going (there were several places) and 2) I didn't know it would be expensive for 1 meal. Jasmine and Andrew chose their favorite place and we ate there. Jasmine paid around $115 for the three of us, (which included $30 for my meal). She said I could reimburse her back via food/service/items.

This is bothering me for weeks now; she STILL owes me money. I want to text her and ask for my roughly $22 back.

WIBTA if I ask Jasmine to pay me back?

Their quality and quantity of inventory in the PX/BX is way down. Their prices are usually higher than off base, even though they act like they are “saving” you money by not charging taxes. With the exception of the occasional sale, they are overpriced. The exchange seems dead all the time also, as it appears most people avoid them and shop off post. 

The barber shops are more expensive than off post, and you don’t always get the best haircut either. 

The food courts at both are disgusting. Dirty tables, overflowing trash, floors covered in garbage, half of the drink fountains do not work and the staff are dirty. Not to mention, the food is more expensive than off base and the quality is way down, along with portion sizes.

24 hour shopettes are a thing of the past. They were not “making enough money” to stay open 24/7. What about the drills, the MP’s/Security Forces, medical personell, staff duty and CQ duty who might need a cup of coffee or want a snack? Are they JUST there to make a profit now, or serve the Soldiers and Airmen they are supposed to serve? 

It is sad what has happened to AAFES. I remember when I came into the military 20 years ago, these issues were not a thing. They served the bases and people very well. I hope they can return the exchange to what it once was. ",41,1753297398.0,AirForce,17,0.86,False

After living here for 5 years and taking countless visitors around, this tour has become my go-to recommendation.

I've done the math - Oahu's perimeter is roughly 112 miles. Even if you walked 12 hours a day at a steady pace, it would take about 5-6 days to complete. Plus, some coastal areas aren't accessible by foot.

Instead, I highly recommend taking a guided tour that covers all the major highlights in just 8 hours. Last month, I joined the Circle Island Tour again (I try to go once a year), and it reminded me why it's such a perfect introduction to Oahu.

The tour starts early in Waikiki, which I actually appreciate because you beat the crowds at popular spots. Our first stop was Diamond Head lookout - the morning light there is something else. From there, we wound our way along the coast, stopping at Halona Blowhole where we spotted whales breaching (if you're lucky like we were).

The North Shore portion was my favorite part. We stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach and hit up the local fruit stands. The fresh coconuts and pineapple there taste nothing like what you get on the mainland.

A major highlight was Waimea Valley and its waterfall. Unlike many tourist spots, this one lets you actually swim in the falls. Pro tip: bring your swimsuit and a quick-dry towel. The botanical gardens there are incredible too - you'll see plants you never knew existed.

I've found this particular tour (which you can book here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) offers the best value for your money. For $154, you get:
- All entrance fees included
- An actual local guide (not just a driver with a script)
- Comfortable air-conditioned transport
- Coffee and macadamia nut tastings
- Perfect photo opportunities at all the major spots

The small group size (max 24 people) means you're not herded around like cattle. Our guide shared fascinating stories about Hawaiian history and culture that you won't find in guidebooks.

From my experience, doing this exact route independently would cost more in car rental, gas, and entrance fees - not to mention the stress of navigation and parking.

One thing I particularly appreciate is the flexible cancellation policy. You can book now and cancel up to 24 hours before if your plans change. I've used this feature myself when island weather got unpredictable.

So while walking around Oahu sounds adventurous, a well-organized circle island tour is the smarter way to experience the island's diversity in a single day. You'll see everything from volcanic formations to tropical rainforests, historic sites to modern Hawaiian culture.

Bottom line: If you're visiting Oahu and want to see it all without spending a week walking, this tour is your best bet. Just remember to book in advance - the good tours fill up fast, especially during peak season.",1,1753297329.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

1m7ht6f,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0T90yOGY6Q,I wrote a song as a gift...would you appreciate it?,"I have always wanted to write and perform a song of my own but always stumbled at the first hurdle of writing lyrics.

I set a goal this year of finally completing something from start to finish. Turns out what I needed was a subject and reason to write. When I decided I was going to gift my brother and fiancée a song as a wedding present (getting married in October) it gave me the inspiration and drive to get it done.

The song uses elements of their love story, first date, humour and things they enjoy with an overall theme of autumn leaves as this is when they got engaged and they are getting married in their favourite place Richmond Park, London.

I’d love some feedback, any tips of how to improve or progress, I’ve really enjoyed creating this, even if it has taken 6 months so far!!

Thanks in advance!

Lyrics:



**Verse 1**

Waking up with you, I feel alive

Like a hit of Autumn air.

Makes me want to dive, into life with you

A whole world without a care.



**Pre chorus** 

The seasons come and go,

Our love never dies.

Oh when I’m with you,

365.



**Chorus**

Were like the Autumn leaves

But our love is all year round.

We’re just like the trees,

I’m so glad we found.

No matter where we go,

We’ll make time for a show.

The world is our stage, 

You make me glow.



**Verse 2**

Hand in hand with you, 

Our quiet place.

Reminds me of the time.

We tried to watch that film, 

On our first date,

When I knew you would be mine.



**Pre chorus** 

Because we had a surprise,

Vin diesel arrived.

It’s fast and furious 10,

Haven’t seen the other nine.



**Chorus**

Were like the Autumn leaves

But our love is all year round.

We’re just like the trees,

I’m so glad we found.

No matter where we go,

We’ll make time for a show.

The world is our stage, 

You make me glow.



**Post Chorus**

We love the finer things,

Fancy chocolate, coffee and treats.

A few of our favourite things,

Don’t compare to the Autumn leaves.

But these last for all four seasons,

I can’t count up all the reasons.

Why my love for you,

Is like the Autumn leaves.",2,1753296931.0,Songwriting,3,1.0,False

1m7hs2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1m7hs2l/why_choose_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop_coffee_maker/,Why Choose the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee Maker for Your Morning Brew?,"Compact and versatile, the Nespresso ENV92B has been a part of my daily routine for weeks now. I’ve tested it thoroughly, from brewing small espressos to crafting larger iced coffees, and I’m glad to say this little machine meets the hype—mostly. The sleek Liquorice Black design stands out without being overly flashy, and its petite dimensions make it a perfect fit for my cluttered kitchen countertop. Let me walk you through my hands-on experience with this coffee and espresso machine and all the highs (and a couple of lows) that come with it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the machine’s compact size and unique shape were the first things to catch my eye. Measuring just 14 inches deep, 8.6 inches wide, and 10.4 inches tall, it slides into small spaces effortlessly. It’s crafted from 35% recycled plastic, and while it doesn’t feel super premium, the sturdy build gave me enough confidence to fiddle around with its adjustable drip tray and removable water tank without feeling like I’d accidentally break something. 

The color is perfect—Liquorice Black has a chic, modern vibe that complements any decor, whether in a sterile office environment or a cozy, colorful kitchen. Whoever designed this clearly had aesthetics and functionality in mind.

**Brewing Performance**  
Performance is top-tier here, thanks to Nespresso’s Centrifusion technology. This machine reads the barcode on each Vertuo capsule to automatically adjust brewing parameters like temperature, water amount, and spin speed. It’s nerdy tech for coffee lovers, and honestly, I found it fascinating. My favorite feature? The ability to brew five cup sizes! Whether I wanted a single shot of espresso or to sip on an XL iced coffee during a long workday, the machine handled it all effortlessly.

I timed the heat-up, and it never took more than 30 seconds to get going. That’s faster than most other machines I’ve used. The crema (you know, that frothy, decadent layer on top of your coffee) was gorgeous every single time. Espresso purists may argue about its authenticity, but I loved the consistency and flavor.

**Pluses**  
- Stylish, compact design fits into small spaces.  
- Centrifusion technology ensures a perfect brew every time.  
- Brews five different cup sizes, offering flexibility.  
- Fast heat-up time (just 30 seconds).

**Ease of Operation and Connectivity**  
User-friendliness is where the Nespresso ENV92B shines. Its one-touch brewing system is as simple as it gets—pop in a Vertuo coffee capsule, press the button, and let the machine do its thing. I even had my coffee-averse roommate try it, and she couldn’t mess it up.

The connectivity features were a bit of a pleasant surprise. I connected it to my smartphone, and from there, I could calibrate brew strength, set reminders for cleaning or descaling, and even update the machine’s software. This connectivity keeps the device running at its best, and while I don’t use it daily, it’s been handy a few times.

**Taste and Capsule Options**  
Nespresso capsules are expensive, but there’s no denying the quality. Each capsule is hermetically sealed to keep the coffee fresh, and the variety is immense. While I stuck primarily to espresso and iced coffee capsules, exploring the extended range for different brews like Gran Lungo was fun. The machine utilizes its barcode scanning technology to adapt its brewing process to each capsule automatically.

I will say, though, that using only proprietary capsules is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it guarantees compatibility and a consistent outcome; on the other, I wished for the option to use third-party coffee pods to experiment a bit more freely.

**Shortcomings**  
- Limited to Nespresso’s proprietary Vertuo capsules.  
- Capsule costs can add up over time.  

**Other Options**  
In its price range, the Nespresso Vertuo Next and Keurig K-Supreme are worth mentioning as competitors. While the Vertuo Next offers a similar brewing setup and tech, its narrower cup range might turn off some buyers. Keurig, meanwhile, wins on versatility with both K-pods and third-party pod compatibility, but the taste and crema quality don’t match Nespresso’s. If you’re after variety or have a tighter budget, Keurig might be more appealing, but for richer flavors and sophistication, Nespresso is the way to go.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
The machine sits in a slightly premium bracket for single-serve coffee makers but justifies it with perks like premium coffee quality, state-of-the-art tech features, and a stylish aesthetic. Capsule costs might make consistent daily usage tough on your wallet. However, if you’re someone who values quality over quantity or frequently treats yourself to fancy coffees at cafes anyway, this machine’s offerings feel worth the investment.

How do I start breaking down why I'm feeling it this way?,"I have been in a relationship of four years with my boyfriend (26M). We met in university and are now freshly out of grad school and are PhD students. Ever since I've started my relationship I've started engaging less in my hobbies and my lifestyle has changed. I no longer go to the gym every day (I go maximum once a month), don't visit bookstores to read every week, meet my friends often.



My lifestyle has also changed quite a bit. I've always kept to a very strict diet, but it's become much unhealthier ever since entering this relationship. To note, we both work at universities around an hour away from each other, so we just end up spending the weekend together in bed cuddling, going out for food, and maybe going to a coffee shop to do work together. I used to wake up at 5am everyday to start the day. But sometimes he comes over during the week to stay at my place, and that also breaks my rhythm, as I use the time I could go to the gym or read to cook and spend time with him, and I also wake up later so that I don't disturb his sleep.



I don't dislike the conversations we have nor the weekends we share at the moment, but I feel like I have changed. I have become more of a listener although I myself am a very talkative person. And it's only at this four year mark that I've realised I feel unhealthier and less fulfilled because I have not engaged in my hobbies.



I know that this unhappiness could probably stems from me tailoring myself and my lifestyle to my boyfriend's, but I know these are not the only compromises I have made – my friendships and my relationship with my family members because my boyfriend does not have many friends and does not prioritise his family in the same way.



I feel compelled to solve this situation as my boyfriend has suggested moving in together. I also don't know what I am doing wrong, and I don't know how to break down why I feel this way.

 



I’d like to know whether I am unhappy because I am in an incompatible relationship in the first place, or whether I’m just overthinking some small compromises I should be making anyways, since partners are never perfectly compatible. Is there also something I should be doing to prioritise my hobbies or myself in the relationship? Any book recommendations are also welcome.

1m7hqww,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1m7hqww/toys_part_i/,[TOYS] - Part I,"The house was a steal.

Two stories, right in the middle of town. A winding staircase, the kind I always wish I had as a kid. Ample kitchen with brand new appliances and a ceiling in the living room I couldn’t reach even if I jumped with my arms up. It was an old house and it sat right in the middle of an equally old square in a town that was small enough and far enough away from the city you could see the stars at night, but not so small that we weren’t in walking distance from an old ice cream shop, a diner, a couple restaurants. Charm and character, in both the house and where it was located.

The house was ideal.  At least, it should have been.

It was a big step for the three of us. My wife and I and our daughter. Our only. She had just turned three and part of why we moved out of the city was for her – cliché reasons really, the kind you always hear when young parents migrate: the search for better schools, safety. Being closer to family.

But the other reasons were for us. We wanted a house we could afford, one that felt like we weren’t stuffing ourselves and our belongings inside like sardines. A place we could call our own, that we could fill with new and better memories.

It should have been that house.

I still remember walking into the room the day we met with our realtor.

“This is Win’s room,” Jess had said, almost as soon as she stepped in. And following her inside, I saw why.

The room was the second largest bedroom in the house. The color of the carpet was different – a verdant green. The windows were lower; with wide ledges I could just see becoming the perfect stages for Win’s already impressive collection of toys. An ample closet, the only one in the house that didn’t have any loose nails hanging from the paneled interior.

And then there was the nook.

We thought it was a second closet at first, just one without a door. It had a sloping roof that ran down one side of the small space to the carpeted floor. A perfect little play area, one we knew Win with her already exploding imagination could make her own. The kind of play space we both wish we would have had as kids. And it was right next door to our room, so we’d be able to hear her through the walls if she woke up in the middle of the night.

“Oh, good thinking,” the realtor said, smiling and stepping into the threshold of the nook with us, “this was the former owner’s kid’s room too. They left this here.”

She pointed to a section of the interior, wooden boards supporting a shelf near the entrance. There were names there, written in what looked like a pink magic marker. Candace. Marie. Next to each a date and what looked like at first glance to be dates. Written in cleaner script than the names, probably the parent’s handwriting.

“06/19/99” next to Candace.

“08/02/01” for Marie.

“I thought to leave that,” the realtor said, smiling at the way we were examining the names, “some houses need a little record of good memories.”

We agreed. And, in hindsight, seeing that room was what sold us. What helped us overlook the work we’d need to put into the place, the sloping floors next to the front door and the unfinished basement. The spackling it so badly needed, the doorknobs that needed replacing on nearly every door.

It was the idea that this house had already been lived in, that it had cherished memories in its bones. A feeling we thought to add to, a good kind of haunting. One we could add to.

The move was an ordeal for us. We weren’t exactly out in the boonies, but we were still pretty far from the city. My wife still had a job downtown and until she found something else would have to commute there and back – over an hour one way. She worked at a software company and recently got a promotion, which meant she had to work later as well. We shared a car since I started working from home, which meant the first few weeks after we moved she was gone for long stretches.

Sunup to sundown.

My work was pretty laid back, which was a blessing – it meant that I could watch Win during the day. Our parents weren’t far, and we could get either set of them to sit for us if we needed but – I don’t know. I guess I had this thought that I could really build some good memories with her those first few weeks. We’d been so caught up in life in the city, and our apartment there was so small. We'd nearly spent the entirety of our daughter's first three years on top of each other. I wanted to give her a space she could explore - a space she could settle into and find out was her own.

I wanted her to play.

“How did we live with all of this before?” Jess asked me. We were unpacking Win’s clothes and toys in her room while she watched TV downstairs. The TV was the first thing we had set up, and our daughter’s room was next on the list. Our things were still in boxes.

“I don’t know,” I said, unloading a box filled with stuffed animals and a variety of small, plastic bugs. She was a tomboy, and we knew that already. She was obsessed with bugs, with playing in the dirt. Animals. She had less of an interest in princesses and more of a taste for what lived in the dirt. For what lived under rocks.

“She’s going to grow out of all of this so fast,” Jess said, a little t-shirt in her hands as she folded it and put it in Win’s dresser, “in a few years we’ll just be packing all of this away and taking it to Goodwill.”

“I guess so,” I said, unpacking my own box, “or maybe we’ll find someone to give it all to. Hand-me-downs.”

“Maybe,” Jess said, her back still to me, “or maybe we’ll just hold on to them. In case we need some toddler clothes again in a couple of years.”

I looked at her, my face lighting up with a smile. Warmth shooting through me – giddy and sudden. She didn’t turn around, but I could tell she said it with a smile in her voice. We were going to make this place our home, a real home. We had years and years’ worth of dreaming to fill every corner of the house. We were going to grow our family here.

It was one of the first joyful moments in that new house.

Here was another:

Every night before we tucked Win into bed, I set out her toys for her in the morning. She had a few favorites – a pink bunny we thrifted while Jess was still pregnant, some bright and speckled blocks. A brown plastic spider, a green grasshopper. Plastic flowers she could take apart and put back together again – stem and leaf and bud. A plastic spade and shovel with miniature handles and a set of tiny toads.

Before, at our cramped apartment, I had laid each of them out at the foot of her bed, burying the bugs and toads in her comforter. Setting up the flowers in their pieces, the blocks next to her dig site, and the bunny behind the rest – to watch over them all. And Win had the same routine every morning: as soon as she woke up she would take the spade and the shovel and dig out her friends. Finding them in the “dirt” and saying “there you are” with each one she unearthed.

She had a hard time saying “toad” so she said “frog” instead, or “fog” to be more precise. “Spider” was “Spider” but “Grasshopper” was “Grass-y-hopper”. The pink bunny was dubbed “Snacks” and she often talked to him as she dug up the rest of her friends with the plastic shovel and spade in her comforter, narrating her excavations aloud.

The first night we spent in that house, I decided to make a change. I took her baby blanket, the one she no longer slept with but still dragged around with her sometimes into our room or to take in front of the TV and buried her friends underneath. Taking them all over to her nook. Setting Snacks in the threshold of the door to lead the way.

The first morning she woke up in her own bed (getting her to sleep that night had been its own sort of trial), I watched from the doorway of her bedroom. My wife had left already as the sun was coming up so she could get ahead of traffic and I had a few hours more until I had to make a show of doing any sort of real work in my office downstairs.

So, I spent the beginning of my day watching my little girl wake up. Sitting up in her bed, watching the daze of sleep wear off as she looked around – half-wondering where she was in the same way we all do when we wake up some place new and strange.

I saw her look to the foot of her bed for her friends. Her puzzled expression at their absence lasted only a few moments before Snacks caught her eye, sitting in the corner; her fluffy pink sign that led to her own little rabbit hole, lighting the way.

I smiled, trying to stifle a pleased little chuckle, as I watched her get up. Her face lit up as she walked over to her nook to see what I had laid out there while she slept.

Just like that we had a new routine. Win had her own space to play – her own little chamber for her imagination. And it didn’t take her long at all to get to work. Talking aloud to Snacks, her sentences filling up more and more every day. My special gift so well received.

I wish I could have lived in that time forever.

I had no idea what the next few weeks had in store for me. For us.  Before the Lonely Way. Before Milkshake.

Because if I did know? I would have picked up my little girl in my arms and ran out of that house.

I would have run away and never looked back.

\*\*

“Babe?” Jess said, sticking her head out of our room.

I’d been carrying a few boxes into the storage room, the one we hadn’t decided what to do with yet. It might become an office, or a place for Jess to work if she was able to work from home anytime soon. Maybe a library like the one I always wanted as a kid. We had the books for it.

“Yeah,” I answered, setting down my load in the doorway. Win’s room was across the hall, the door shut. It was just after sundown and I could still hear the movie we’d left on for her on her tablet playing inside – she went through favorite films in waves, and the latest was Alice in Wonderland. I could see Alice trapped in the bottle from the other side of the door.

Still, I tried to keep my voice down.

“Come here,” Jess said, hushed. Her eyes were wide, her mouth open.

I didn’t like that look.

I made my way into our bedroom, quickly, my instinct telling me to shut the door behind me after I saw Jess’s expression. I was already preparing myself for some kind of bad news or the start of a fight, spinning, trying to think if there was something I said that I could get ahead of.

Instead, when I turned around, I saw our closet door was open. Jess standing right by it, her arms crossed. Pale.

The room had been an obvious pick for us when we toured the house. It was right across the hall from the bathroom, and even though we’d been wishing for an en suite, the walk-in closet had swayed us. It was huge, lined with shelves and rails for hangers, and slots for shoes. And Jess, being one of those rare breeds of women who owned a lot of clothes, had lit up almost as bright as when she’d seen Win’s room for the first time. I suppose the space was a kind of nook for her, a place she could fill with her own expression. I was happy to see that look then.

But that memory was losing its color now.

“What?” I said, still hushed, still in quiet Dad mode.

“I,” she said, blushing, “I was trying to fit some boxes up on the top shelf and I was shoving them back.”

I looked up to the farthest shelf at the back of the closet and saw what she was going to say even before she said it.

A section of the wall had slid to the side. What looked, upon our first inspection, to be a solid wall was actually a painted panel. It was hanging askew, the corner of it pushed into a darkened space that I didn’t know about.

“I’m sorry,” she said, “I think I, I don’t know, shouldn’t there be a wall there?”

“There should be,” I said, frowning. Stepping closer to the back of the closet.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. Mildew and old wood. Old paint. It made my nose itch and the back of my mouth water.

“I got some dust, or paint chips, or something on some of the boxes,” she said, behind me.

“That’s alright,” I said, half-paying attention. My gaze was focused on the corner of dark that appeared in the back of our closet.

I reached out, taking the loose panel in my hands. I tugged on it, lightly at first. It gave a little and I pulled harder until it was free.

“It’s plywood,” I said, “it’s like, really flimsy plywood.”

I turned around to her.

“Help me take some of these down really quick?”

She nodded, some of the worry fallen off of her face. She was with me, and I with her – both of us curious as hell.

It only took a few minutes to move most of what we’d stored in the closet aside, pushing everything as far back away from the wall as we could. When it was done, I moved next to the shadow square in our wall to try the panel next to it.

“I think they were nailed together once,” I said, feeling it come loose after a few careful tugs.'

“But why?” she asked, taking the panel with gentle hands and laying it next to us at the back of the closet.

It wasn’t much longer until we found our answer. There were four panels in all, each one pried free and laid beside us. Jess took out her phone, flicking open her flashlight and shining it inside.

It was an old staircase, dusty in the dark, with boarded steps rising at a sharp incline, summiting before a thick wooden panel covering a hatch above.

“An attic?” Jess said beside me. She sounded louder, close to me in the space.

I wondered if her heart was beating as fast as mine was.

“Yeah,” I said, shaking my head, “an attic.”

In hindsight, it made sense – the slanted wall of Win's nook, her perfect little play place, must have been under the closet stairs: sloping down towards the carpet, the hidden stairs rising towards the ceiling on the wall’s other side.

“Well, we have to go up there,” Jess said beside me, taking a step forward.

“Hold on a second,” I said, trying to get in front of her, “we don’t know how sturdy those stairs are.”

But Jess was determined. And, in the half-decade we’d been married, I learned quite well that getting in her way when she made up her mind about something would do either of us any good. So I settled for following her, close behind, wincing as I put my foot on the bottom stair.

“There’s more plywood over the doorway,” she said, almost halfway up to the top.

“I know,” I said, “hey, maybe we should wait until morning. Maybe it’s filled in or something.”

“People fill in pools, not attics,” she said.

I shrugged.

“Besides,” she went on, her fingers splaying wide over the piece of wood above her, “I’m not going to sleep in this room for one second knowing there’s some fucking secret space above me.”

And she had a good point there.

I met her at the top of the stairs, both of us leaning against the walls of the narrow flight and helped her push the piece of wood up. It was heavier than the false panels we had taken out of the closet, and we both put our shoulders into it, genuinely straining.

But then the wood gave and – together – we stared into the unknown dark.

“Oh my god,” Jess said, steering her flashlight up and into the black, “oh my fucking god.”

It was an attic alright. Bare wooden beams from the underside of the roof crisscrossed above us. High above us. As we stepped farther up the steps and Jess’s beam showed farther the way forward, we fell into a shocked silence.

It was fucking huge.

And absolutely empty – Jess’s light stretched into the far corners of the space. It was unfinished but not unwalkable – wooden floorboards lined the floor, placed in careful precision.  Looking around, both of us quiet and wide-eyed, we didn’t see a single item. Not a single abandoned box or ancient chest, dress form, or pile of coats. Nothing.

It was a giant, extra room the size of our three bedrooms put together, hidden above us the whole week we’d been living in our new home.

“Babe,” she said, turning to me, both of us smushed up against each other standing halfway out of the stair into the new place, “did we just win a bonus attic?”

I smiled, even in the dark, even though the dark, musty air made my eyes water.

“Yeah,” I said, “I think we did.”

\*\*

Look, I know – I’ve seen horror movies. I’ve seen the one where the new family moves into the new house and everything seems perfect until…

Well, we all know what could be hiding at the end of that thought.  

I’d be lying if I said that the thought didn’t cross my mind while taking apart the panels at the back of the closet. And again at some point through the following weeks. It was a persistent echo, a little whisper in the back of my head growing long in tooth and throat, harder and harsher.

Until it was too late. Until it was screaming.

But you know what scares away the spookies? Sitting up in bed with Jess that night, talking way later than we meant to, dreaming while awake about all of the things we could do with that attic – a playroom, a bigger office, a super-cool bedroom for Win when she got older. We imagined our girl as a full-blown teenager, sneaking out of the tiny attic window we spotted in the far corner to the roof, climbing down the tree in the front yard to meet her friends for some late-night teenager mischief.

There were other joys too. Win’s growing routine in her nook, the way she looked up at us and smiled after running around in the backyard and turning over rocks for earthworms. The way the sun came in the kitchen and lit Jess’s face up on the slow mornings we had most weekends. The walk we all took together down the street, noticing how close we were to the elementary school even if the years when we’d need to think about that seemed so far away. So measured.

I was even starting to love the way the floorboards creaked on the stairs on my way down each morning. All of the sounds the old house made were little symphonies. Accompanying our shared and growing chord that this boon, this place we found and were both so willing to fall in love with, was our home.

A house is what you put in it, and we put in a lot of love and hope in those early days. I wish it would have caught. I wish it had been enough.

But life’s not like that. Our house…our *home*, wouldn't allow our dream to last. I’ve always wanted to tell a story, and I thought the story that was unfolding for us in that precious time would be one of happiness – of joy and growth and life. That was the story I wanted to hold within me.

That was the story I thought I deserved to tell.

But instead, it goes like this:

A couple weeks later I woke in the middle of the night, shooting straight up in bed. An aching peal shook me from a dream. It was decidedly new – a slow, hollow ache – not like the stairs or the walls settling, not like the tinkering branches dancing along the side of the house in the wind. It was a yawn, wooden, a long and mournful creak.

I sat there in the dark with Jess deep asleep beside me and listened for a moment – unsure of its origin, or if it was even real. I was having a nightmare, I remember, where I was locked away somewhere in the dark. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t move, and all around me were muffled voices I could almost recognize. They murmured – obscure, strange in tone, and soaked by sorrow.

I ignored it then. Thinking it must have been another voice joining the strange chorus of this old house. But come morning while arranging Win’s toys for her, I found something odd.

I found a new toy in my daughter’s room – one I didn’t remember laying out for her.

There, on the carpet, was a stuffed snake. Crocheted with yarn made of old brittle wool, it looked home-made, but never in our home. I bent down to pick it up, grasping its limp length. As I did, I felt it *crunch* in my grasp.

Its pattern was like a milk snake’s. But off-colored – the hallmark yellow and orange pattern along the spine instead an array of grey hues. Shades of ash standing out against its black, curling length.

Only the eyes looked real. Litle red beads ruby bright even in the shadow of the nook.

“Daddy?” Win asked.

I turned around to see her standing behind me. She was rubbing her eyes and looking at the thing in my hand.

“Honey,” I said, confused, “what is this?”

She shrugged. I looked down at it again, frowning, catching a whiff of something lousy. I brought it to my nose and breathed in, hard.  

It smelled like mildew. Like wet and damp. Like somewhere old.

“It looks like a milk snake,” I said, out loud, pushing the toy away from my face.

“Milkshake?” Win asked.

I looked at her, and even then it was hard not to break out into a smile. When she was a little girl, she came up with half-way names for things all the time. Bumblebees were “bumbbie-bees”. Rocks were “shocks”, and every car was a “tuck” unless it was mine, my old Corolla, which she called “Corolla”.

The echo of that small stretch of time, of who she was and who she had grown out of, lit a little mirth in me. I couldn’t help it.

“Sure darling,” I said, crouching down to meet her eyes, “Milkshake. Where did you get this?”

She took a few steps closer, taking the toy from my hand. I was glad to be rid of it. It felt cold despite where I’d found it – bent on the carpet in a wash of warm morning sun from the window.

“The toybox Daddy,” she said.

My frown returned and deeper this time. I’d only been up for an hour – reading emails and drinking coffee on the porch after Jess left. I never came into Win’s room until the sun was up, until I was sure she would be stirring out of sleep, just in case my little arrangement woke her up.

“There’s not a toybox honey,” I said, “maybe mom brought it in before she left for work?”

But Win shook her head.          

“There is,” she said.

“Where baby?” I asked. Craning my head around the room – taking in her bed, her closet. The nook.

“There *is*,” she said, louder this time, the edge of a rising tantrum cutting her words.

“Where Win?” I asked, ready for some kind of game. A toybox could be a closet drawer, it could be a shoe. It could be a pillowcase, and maybe Jess had snuck in in the middle of the night to slide the toy somewhere Win would find it. Maybe she was trying to get in herself on the game, her own little secret addition to the ritual.

“Show me then,” I said, ready to be led. I stuck out my hand.

Win took it, turning away from me and leading me to the nook. And those three steps across the carpet of her bedroom were the last easy ones I ever took there.

Because when we came to the nook, to the shadows nestled in its mouth, I saw something in the corner. A toybox, the wood slick and dark. Glistening, like a carapace, like black-licorice candy so freshly sucked.

Its lid was closed. I caught a whiff of something breathy. Of spoil and sick.

My heart dropped, my legs felt weak.

“Where did you get that?” I asked, almost automatically.

“It’s IN there,” Win said, I thought she said, stomping her foot, a habit she’d picked up from Jess when there was nothing else to do and she was overwhelmed. I flinched, I stared down at her, my breath catching.

“I know it’s in there,” I said, “but how- “

And that’s when I realized – I’d misheard her. She hadn’t said the toybox was *in* there. But that it had *been* there.

It’s been there. Been there all along.",2,1753296786.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

I’ve done everything possible: refined my resume, crafted tailored cover letters with the right keywords to get through ATS systems, and aligned every detail to the job description. I’ve reached out to recruiters, analyzed which applications led to interviews, and committed myself fully to the job search for over a year and seven months.

Last year, I even conducted a full self-evaluation to better understand how I was spending my time. I did a personal 360 review for all of 2024 and found that over 50% of my time was spent applying for jobs. The rest went toward maintaining my mental health at the gym and supporting my Aunt and Uncle. I built structure and held myself accountable, doing everything within my power to improve my chances.

During this time, the gym has been my only consistent mental break, Monday through Saturday. While I do my best to stay optimistic, the truth is I’m scared. I’m running out of options and on the brink of homelessness. I’ve exhausted my savings and cut back on nearly all social interactions to stretch every dollar. Coffee helps keep me going, and I often limit my food just to get by.

This has been the hardest period of my life.

And my intuition keeps telling me something deeper is going on. Maybe there simply aren’t enough jobs, or the AT system itself is broken. It’s not just me. I’ve spoken to so many qualified, hard-working people in the same situation. We are doing all the right things: tailoring resumes, networking, staying positive, yet doors remain closed. It’s exhausting, and it makes you question whether the job market is truly based on merit anymore or if we are stuck in a system that no longer works for the people who built it.

Currently in Effect:

Meeting virtually with recruiting agencies and recruiters via Zoom.

Tailoring cover letters and resumes to align with each job description.

Continuously revising and simplifying my resume for better clarity and impact

Attending local hiring events in San Francisco to network. 

I recently attended a hiring event in San Francisco near the old Safeway in Japantown. My projection was to secure at least one interview. Unfortunately, the outcome was disappointing most companies were not hiring, and I did not receive any callbacks.

I also applied to a position at the Success Center in San Francisco, but my application was rejected.

I recognize the importance of meeting recruiters in person to better showcase my qualifications, accomplishments, and potential. I know I’m capable of doing incredible work, and I’m eager to share that more directly in face-to-face conversations.

1m7hiuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1m7hiuq/toys_part_i/,TOYS Part I,"The house was a steal.

Two stories, right in the middle of town. A winding staircase, the kind I always wish I had as a kid. Ample kitchen with brand new appliances and a ceiling in the living room I couldn’t reach even if I jumped with my arms up. It was an old house and it sat right in the middle of an equally old square in a town that was small enough and far enough away from the city you could see the stars at night, but not so small that we weren’t in walking distance from an old ice cream shop, a diner, a couple restaurants. Charm and character, in both the house and where it was located.

The house was ideal.  At least, it should have been.

It was a big step for the three of us. My wife and I and our daughter. Our only. She had just turned three and part of why we moved out of the city was for her – cliché reasons really, the kind you always hear when young parents migrate: the search for better schools, safety. Being closer to family.

But the other reasons were for us. We wanted a house we could afford, one that felt like we weren’t stuffing ourselves and our belongings inside like sardines. A place we could call our own, that we could fill with new and better memories.

It should have been that house.

I still remember walking into the room the day we met with our realtor.

“This is Win’s room,” Jess had said, almost as soon as she stepped in. And following her inside, I saw why.

The room was the second largest bedroom in the house. The color of the carpet was different – a verdant green. The windows were lower; with wide ledges I could just see becoming the perfect stages for Win’s already impressive collection of toys. An ample closet, the only one in the house that didn’t have any loose nails hanging from the paneled interior.

And then there was the nook.

We thought it was a second closet at first, just one without a door. It had a sloping roof that ran down one side of the small space to the carpeted floor. A perfect little play area, one we knew Win with her already exploding imagination could make her own. The kind of play space we both wish we would have had as kids. And it was right next door to our room, so we’d be able to hear her through the walls if she woke up in the middle of the night.

“Oh, good thinking,” the realtor said, smiling and stepping into the threshold of the nook with us, “this was the former owner’s kid’s room too. They left this here.”

She pointed to a section of the interior, wooden boards supporting a shelf near the entrance. There were names there, written in what looked like a pink magic marker. Candace. Marie. Next to each a date and what looked like at first glance to be dates. Written in cleaner script than the names, probably the parent’s handwriting.

“06/19/99” next to Candace.

“08/02/01” for Marie.

“I thought to leave that,” the realtor said, smiling at the way we were examining the names, “some houses need a little record of good memories.”

We agreed. And, in hindsight, seeing that room was what sold us. What helped us overlook the work we’d need to put into the place, the sloping floors next to the front door and the unfinished basement. The spackling it so badly needed, the doorknobs that needed replacing on nearly every door.

It was the idea that this house had already been lived in, that it had cherished memories in its bones. A feeling we thought to add to, a good kind of haunting. One we could add to.

The move was an ordeal for us. We weren’t exactly out in the boonies, but we were still pretty far from the city. My wife still had a job downtown and until she found something else would have to commute there and back – over an hour one way. She worked at a software company and recently got a promotion, which meant she had to work later as well. We shared a car since I started working from home, which meant the first few weeks after we moved she was gone for long stretches.

Sunup to sundown.

My work was pretty laid back, which was a blessing – it meant that I could watch Win during the day. Our parents weren’t far, and we could get either set of them to sit for us if we needed but – I don’t know. I guess I had this thought that I could really build some good memories with her those first few weeks. We’d been so caught up in life in the city, and our apartment there was so small. We'd nearly spent the entirety of our daughter's first three years on top of each other. I wanted to give her a space she could explore - a space she could settle into and find out was her own.

I wanted her to play.

“How did we live with all of this before?” Jess asked me. We were unpacking Win’s clothes and toys in her room while she watched TV downstairs. The TV was the first thing we had set up, and our daughter’s room was next on the list. Our things were still in boxes.

“I don’t know,” I said, unloading a box filled with stuffed animals and a variety of small, plastic bugs. She was a tomboy, and we knew that already. She was obsessed with bugs, with playing in the dirt. Animals. She had less of an interest in princesses and more of a taste for what lived in the dirt. For what lived under rocks.

“She’s going to grow out of all of this so fast,” Jess said, a little t-shirt in her hands as she folded it and put it in Win’s dresser, “in a few years we’ll just be packing all of this away and taking it to Goodwill.”

“I guess so,” I said, unpacking my own box, “or maybe we’ll find someone to give it all to. Hand-me-downs.”

“Maybe,” Jess said, her back still to me, “or maybe we’ll just hold on to them. In case we need some toddler clothes again in a couple of years.”

I looked at her, my face lighting up with a smile. Warmth shooting through me – giddy and sudden. She didn’t turn around, but I could tell she said it with a smile in her voice. We were going to make this place our home, a real home. We had years and years’ worth of dreaming to fill every corner of the house. We were going to grow our family here.

It was one of the first joyful moments in that new house.

Here was another:

Every night before we tucked Win into bed, I set out her toys for her in the morning. She had a few favorites – a pink bunny we thrifted while Jess was still pregnant, some bright and speckled blocks. A brown plastic spider, a green grasshopper. Plastic flowers she could take apart and put back together again – stem and leaf and bud. A plastic spade and shovel with miniature handles and a set of tiny toads.

Before, at our cramped apartment, I had laid each of them out at the foot of her bed, burying the bugs and toads in her comforter. Setting up the flowers in their pieces, the blocks next to her dig site, and the bunny behind the rest – to watch over them all. And Win had the same routine every morning: as soon as she woke up she would take the spade and the shovel and dig out her friends. Finding them in the “dirt” and saying “there you are” with each one she unearthed.

She had a hard time saying “toad” so she said “frog” instead, or “fog” to be more precise. “Spider” was “Spider” but “Grasshopper” was “Grass-y-hopper”. The pink bunny was dubbed “Snacks” and she often talked to him as she dug up the rest of her friends with the plastic shovel and spade in her comforter, narrating her excavations aloud.

The first night we spent in that house, I decided to make a change. I took her baby blanket, the one she no longer slept with but still dragged around with her sometimes into our room or to take in front of the TV and buried her friends underneath. Taking them all over to her nook. Setting Snacks in the threshold of the door to lead the way.

The first morning she woke up in her own bed (getting her to sleep that night had been its own sort of trial), I watched from the doorway of her bedroom. My wife had left already as the sun was coming up so she could get ahead of traffic and I had a few hours more until I had to make a show of doing any sort of real work in my office downstairs.

So, I spent the beginning of my day watching my little girl wake up. Sitting up in her bed, watching the daze of sleep wear off as she looked around – half-wondering where she was in the same way we all do when we wake up some place new and strange.

I saw her look to the foot of her bed for her friends. Her puzzled expression at their absence lasted only a few moments before Snacks caught her eye, sitting in the corner; her fluffy pink sign that led to her own little rabbit hole, lighting the way.

I smiled, trying to stifle a pleased little chuckle, as I watched her get up. Her face lit up as she walked over to her nook to see what I had laid out there while she slept.

Just like that we had a new routine. Win had her own space to play – her own little chamber for her imagination. And it didn’t take her long at all to get to work. Talking aloud to Snacks, her sentences filling up more and more every day. My special gift so well received.

I wish I could have lived in that time forever.

I had no idea what the next few weeks had in store for me. For us.  Before the Lonely Way. Before Milkshake.

Because if I did know? I would have picked up my little girl in my arms and ran out of that house.

I would have run away and never looked back.

\*\*

“Babe?” Jess said, sticking her head out of our room.

I’d been carrying a few boxes into the storage room, the one we hadn’t decided what to do with yet. It might become an office, or a place for Jess to work if she was able to work from home anytime soon. Maybe a library like the one I always wanted as a kid. We had the books for it.

“Yeah,” I answered, setting down my load in the doorway. Win’s room was across the hall, the door shut. It was just after sundown and I could still hear the movie we’d left on for her on her tablet playing inside – she went through favorite films in waves, and the latest was Alice in Wonderland. I could see Alice trapped in the bottle from the other side of the door.

Still, I tried to keep my voice down.

“Come here,” Jess said, hushed. Her eyes were wide, her mouth open.

I didn’t like that look.

I made my way into our bedroom, quickly, my instinct telling me to shut the door behind me after I saw Jess’s expression. I was already preparing myself for some kind of bad news or the start of a fight, spinning, trying to think if there was something I said that I could get ahead of.

Instead, when I turned around, I saw our closet door was open. Jess standing right by it, her arms crossed. Pale.

The room had been an obvious pick for us when we toured the house. It was right across the hall from the bathroom, and even though we’d been wishing for an en suite, the walk-in closet had swayed us. It was huge, lined with shelves and rails for hangers, and slots for shoes. And Jess, being one of those rare breeds of women who owned a lot of clothes, had lit up almost as bright as when she’d seen Win’s room for the first time. I suppose the space was a kind of nook for her, a place she could fill with her own expression. I was happy to see that look then.

But that memory was losing its color now.

“What?” I said, still hushed, still in quiet Dad mode.

“I,” she said, blushing, “I was trying to fit some boxes up on the top shelf and I was shoving them back.”

I looked up to the farthest shelf at the back of the closet and saw what she was going to say even before she said it.

A section of the wall had slid to the side. What looked, upon our first inspection, to be a solid wall was actually a painted panel. It was hanging askew, the corner of it pushed into a darkened space that I didn’t know about.

“I’m sorry,” she said, “I think I, I don’t know, shouldn’t there be a wall there?”

“There should be,” I said, frowning. Stepping closer to the back of the closet.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. Mildew and old wood. Old paint. It made my nose itch and the back of my mouth water.

“I got some dust, or paint chips, or something on some of the boxes,” she said, behind me.

“That’s alright,” I said, half-paying attention. My gaze was focused on the corner of dark that appeared in the back of our closet.

I reached out, taking the loose panel in my hands. I tugged on it, lightly at first. It gave a little and I pulled harder until it was free.

“It’s plywood,” I said, “it’s like, really flimsy plywood.”

I turned around to her.

“Help me take some of these down really quick?”

She nodded, some of the worry fallen off of her face. She was with me, and I with her – both of us curious as hell.

It only took a few minutes to move most of what we’d stored in the closet aside, pushing everything as far back away from the wall as we could. When it was done, I moved next to the shadow square in our wall to try the panel next to it.

“I think they were nailed together once,” I said, feeling it come loose after a few careful tugs.'

“But why?” she asked, taking the panel with gentle hands and laying it next to us at the back of the closet.

It wasn’t much longer until we found our answer. There were four panels in all, each one pried free and laid beside us. Jess took out her phone, flicking open her flashlight and shining it inside.

It was an old staircase, dusty in the dark, with boarded steps rising at a sharp incline, summiting before a thick wooden panel covering a hatch above.

“An attic?” Jess said beside me. She sounded louder, close to me in the space.

I wondered if her heart was beating as fast as mine was.

“Yeah,” I said, shaking my head, “an attic.”

In hindsight, it made sense – the slanted wall of Win's nook, her perfect little play place, must have been under the closet stairs: sloping down towards the carpet, the hidden stairs rising towards the ceiling on the wall’s other side.

“Well, we have to go up there,” Jess said beside me, taking a step forward.

“Hold on a second,” I said, trying to get in front of her, “we don’t know how sturdy those stairs are.”

But Jess was determined. And, in the half-decade we’d been married, I learned quite well that getting in her way when she made up her mind about something would do either of us any good. So I settled for following her, close behind, wincing as I put my foot on the bottom stair.

“There’s more plywood over the doorway,” she said, almost halfway up to the top.

“I know,” I said, “hey, maybe we should wait until morning. Maybe it’s filled in or something.”

“People fill in pools, not attics,” she said.

I shrugged.

“Besides,” she went on, her fingers splaying wide over the piece of wood above her, “I’m not going to sleep in this room for one second knowing there’s some fucking secret space above me.”

And she had a good point there.

I met her at the top of the stairs, both of us leaning against the walls of the narrow flight and helped her push the piece of wood up. It was heavier than the false panels we had taken out of the closet, and we both put our shoulders into it, genuinely straining.

But then the wood gave and – together – we stared into the unknown dark.

“Oh my god,” Jess said, steering her flashlight up and into the black, “oh my fucking god.”

It was an attic alright. Bare wooden beams from the underside of the roof crisscrossed above us. High above us. As we stepped farther up the steps and Jess’s beam showed farther the way forward, we fell into a shocked silence.

It was fucking huge.

And absolutely empty – Jess’s light stretched into the far corners of the space. It was unfinished but not unwalkable – wooden floorboards lined the floor, placed in careful precision.  Looking around, both of us quiet and wide-eyed, we didn’t see a single item. Not a single abandoned box or ancient chest, dress form, or pile of coats. Nothing.

It was a giant, extra room the size of our three bedrooms put together, hidden above us the whole week we’d been living in our new home.

“Babe,” she said, turning to me, both of us smushed up against each other standing halfway out of the stair into the new place, “did we just win a bonus attic?”

I smiled, even in the dark, even though the dark, musty air made my eyes water.

“Yeah,” I said, “I think we did.”

\*\*

Look, I know – I’ve seen horror movies. I’ve seen the one where the new family moves into the new house and everything seems perfect until…

Well, we all know what could be hiding at the end of that thought.  

I’d be lying if I said that the thought didn’t cross my mind while taking apart the panels at the back of the closet. And again at some point through the following weeks. It was a persistent echo, a little whisper in the back of my head growing long in tooth and throat, harder and harsher.

Until it was too late. Until it was screaming.

But you know what scares away the spookies? Sitting up in bed with Jess that night, talking way later than we meant to, dreaming while awake about all of the things we could do with that attic – a playroom, a bigger office, a super-cool bedroom for Win when she got older. We imagined our girl as a full-blown teenager, sneaking out of the tiny attic window we spotted in the far corner to the roof, climbing down the tree in the front yard to meet her friends for some late-night teenager mischief.

There were other joys too. Win’s growing routine in her nook, the way she looked up at us and smiled after running around in the backyard and turning over rocks for earthworms. The way the sun came in the kitchen and lit Jess’s face up on the slow mornings we had most weekends. The walk we all took together down the street, noticing how close we were to the elementary school even if the years when we’d need to think about that seemed so far away. So measured.

I was even starting to love the way the floorboards creaked on the stairs on my way down each morning. All of the sounds the old house made were little symphonies. Accompanying our shared and growing chord that this boon, this place we found and were both so willing to fall in love with, was our home.

A house is what you put in it, and we put in a lot of love and hope in those early days. I wish it would have caught. I wish it had been enough.

But life’s not like that. Our house…our *home*, wouldn't allow our dream to last. I’ve always wanted to tell a story, and I thought the story that was unfolding for us in that precious time would be one of happiness – of joy and growth and life. That was the story I wanted to hold within me.

That was the story I thought I deserved to tell.

But instead, it goes like this:

A couple weeks later I woke in the middle of the night, shooting straight up in bed. An aching peal shook me from a dream. It was decidedly new – a slow, hollow ache – not like the stairs or the walls settling, not like the tinkering branches dancing along the side of the house in the wind. It was a yawn, wooden, a long and mournful creak.

I sat there in the dark with Jess deep asleep beside me and listened for a moment – unsure of its origin, or if it was even real. I was having a nightmare, I remember, where I was locked away somewhere in the dark. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t move, and all around me were muffled voices I could almost recognize. They murmured – obscure, strange in tone, and soaked by sorrow.

I ignored it then. Thinking it must have been another voice joining the strange chorus of this old house. But come morning while arranging Win’s toys for her, I found something odd.

I found a new toy in my daughter’s room – one I didn’t remember laying out for her.

There, on the carpet, was a stuffed snake. Crocheted with yarn made of old brittle wool, it looked home-made, but never in our home. I bent down to pick it up, grasping its limp length. As I did, I felt it *crunch* in my grasp.

Its pattern was like a milk snake’s. But off-colored – the hallmark yellow and orange pattern along the spine instead an array of grey hues. Shades of ash standing out against its black, curling length.

Only the eyes looked real. Litle red beads ruby bright even in the shadow of the nook.

“Daddy?” Win asked.

I turned around to see her standing behind me. She was rubbing her eyes and looking at the thing in my hand.

“Honey,” I said, confused, “what is this?”

She shrugged. I looked down at it again, frowning, catching a whiff of something lousy. I brought it to my nose and breathed in, hard.  

It smelled like mildew. Like wet and damp. Like somewhere old.

“It looks like a milk snake,” I said, out loud, pushing the toy away from my face.

“Milkshake?” Win asked.

I looked at her, and even then it was hard not to break out into a smile. When she was a little girl, she came up with half-way names for things all the time. Bumblebees were “bumbbie-bees”. Rocks were “shocks”, and every car was a “tuck” unless it was mine, my old Corolla, which she called “Corolla”.

The echo of that small stretch of time, of who she was and who she had grown out of, lit a little mirth in me. I couldn’t help it.

“Sure darling,” I said, crouching down to meet her eyes, “Milkshake. Where did you get this?”

She took a few steps closer, taking the toy from my hand. I was glad to be rid of it. It felt cold despite where I’d found it – bent on the carpet in a wash of warm morning sun from the window.

“The toybox Daddy,” she said.

My frown returned and deeper this time. I’d only been up for an hour – reading emails and drinking coffee on the porch after Jess left. I never came into Win’s room until the sun was up, until I was sure she would be stirring out of sleep, just in case my little arrangement woke her up.

“There’s not a toybox honey,” I said, “maybe mom brought it in before she left for work?”

But Win shook her head.          

“There is,” she said.

“Where baby?” I asked. Craning my head around the room – taking in her bed, her closet. The nook.

“There *is*,” she said, louder this time, the edge of a rising tantrum cutting her words.

“Where Win?” I asked, ready for some kind of game. A toybox could be a closet drawer, it could be a shoe. It could be a pillowcase, and maybe Jess had snuck in in the middle of the night to slide the toy somewhere Win would find it. Maybe she was trying to get in herself on the game, her own little secret addition to the ritual.

“Show me then,” I said, ready to be led. I stuck out my hand.

Win took it, turning away from me and leading me to the nook. And those three steps across the carpet of her bedroom were the last easy ones I ever took there.

Because when we came to the nook, to the shadows nestled in its mouth, I saw something in the corner. A toybox, the wood slick and dark. Glistening, like a carapace, like black-licorice candy so freshly sucked.

Its lid was closed. I caught a whiff of something breathy. Of spoil and sick.

My heart dropped, my legs felt weak.

“Where did you get that?” I asked, almost automatically.

“It’s IN there,” Win said, I thought she said, stomping her foot, a habit she’d picked up from Jess when there was nothing else to do and she was overwhelmed. I flinched, I stared down at her, my breath catching.

“I know it’s in there,” I said, “but how- “

And that’s when I realized – I’d misheard her. She hadn’t said the toybox was *in* there. But that it had *been* there.

It’s been there. Been there all along.",4,1753296276.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False

Two stories, right in the middle of town. A winding staircase, the kind I always wish I had as a kid. Ample kitchen with brand new appliances and a ceiling in the living room I couldn’t reach even if I jumped with my arms up. It was an old house and it sat right in the middle of an equally old square in a town that was small enough and far enough away from the city you could see the stars at night, but not so small that we weren’t in walking distance from an old ice cream shop, a diner, a couple restaurants. Charm and character, in both the house and where it was located.

The house was ideal.  At least, it should have been.

It was a big step for the three of us. My wife and I and our daughter. Our only. She had just turned three and part of why we moved out of the city was for her – cliché reasons really, the kind you always hear when young parents migrate: the search for better schools, safety. Being closer to family.

But the other reasons were for us. We wanted a house we could afford, one that felt like we weren’t stuffing ourselves and our belongings inside like sardines. A place we could call our own, that we could fill with new and better memories.

It should have been that house.

I still remember walking into the room the day we met with our realtor.

“This is Win’s room,” Jess had said, almost as soon as she stepped in. And following her inside, I saw why.

The room was the second largest bedroom in the house. The color of the carpet was different – a verdant green. The windows were lower; with wide ledges I could just see becoming the perfect stages for Win’s already impressive collection of toys. An ample closet, the only one in the house that didn’t have any loose nails hanging from the paneled interior.

And then there was the nook.

We thought it was a second closet at first, just one without a door. It had a sloping roof that ran down one side of the small space to the carpeted floor. A perfect little play area, one we knew Win with her already exploding imagination could make her own. The kind of play space we both wish we would have had as kids. And it was right next door to our room, so we’d be able to hear her through the walls if she woke up in the middle of the night.

“Oh, good thinking,” the realtor said, smiling and stepping into the threshold of the nook with us, “this was the former owner’s kid’s room too. They left this here.”

She pointed to a section of the interior, wooden boards supporting a shelf near the entrance. There were names there, written in what looked like a pink magic marker. Candace. Marie. Next to each a date and what looked like at first glance to be dates. Written in cleaner script than the names, probably the parent’s handwriting.

“06/19/99” next to Candace.

“08/02/01” for Marie.

“I thought to leave that,” the realtor said, smiling at the way we were examining the names, “some houses need a little record of good memories.”

We agreed. And, in hindsight, seeing that room was what sold us. What helped us overlook the work we’d need to put into the place, the sloping floors next to the front door and the unfinished basement. The spackling it so badly needed, the doorknobs that needed replacing on nearly every door.

It was the idea that this house had already been lived in, that it had cherished memories in its bones. A feeling we thought to add to, a good kind of haunting. One we could add to.

The move was an ordeal for us. We weren’t exactly out in the boonies, but we were still pretty far from the city. My wife still had a job downtown and until she found something else would have to commute there and back – over an hour one way. She worked at a software company and recently got a promotion, which meant she had to work later as well. We shared a car since I started working from home, which meant the first few weeks after we moved she was gone for long stretches.

Sunup to sundown.

My work was pretty laid back, which was a blessing – it meant that I could watch Win during the day. Our parents weren’t far, and we could get either set of them to sit for us if we needed but – I don’t know. I guess I had this thought that I could really build some good memories with her those first few weeks. We’d been so caught up in life in the city, and our apartment there was so small. We'd nearly spent the entirety of our daughter's first three years on top of each other. I wanted to give her a space she could explore - a space she could settle into and find out was her own.

I wanted her to play.

“How did we live with all of this before?” Jess asked me. We were unpacking Win’s clothes and toys in her room while she watched TV downstairs. The TV was the first thing we had set up, and our daughter’s room was next on the list. Our things were still in boxes.

“I don’t know,” I said, unloading a box filled with stuffed animals and a variety of small, plastic bugs. She was a tomboy, and we knew that already. She was obsessed with bugs, with playing in the dirt. Animals. She had less of an interest in princesses and more of a taste for what lived in the dirt. For what lived under rocks.

“She’s going to grow out of all of this so fast,” Jess said, a little t-shirt in her hands as she folded it and put it in Win’s dresser, “in a few years we’ll just be packing all of this away and taking it to Goodwill.”

“I guess so,” I said, unpacking my own box, “or maybe we’ll find someone to give it all to. Hand-me-downs.”

“Maybe,” Jess said, her back still to me, “or maybe we’ll just hold on to them. In case we need some toddler clothes again in a couple of years.”

I looked at her, my face lighting up with a smile. Warmth shooting through me – giddy and sudden. She didn’t turn around, but I could tell she said it with a smile in her voice. We were going to make this place our home, a real home. We had years and years’ worth of dreaming to fill every corner of the house. We were going to grow our family here.

It was one of the first joyful moments in that new house.

Here was another:

Every night before we tucked Win into bed, I set out her toys for her in the morning. She had a few favorites – a pink bunny we thrifted while Jess was still pregnant, some bright and speckled blocks. A brown plastic spider, a green grasshopper. Plastic flowers she could take apart and put back together again – stem and leaf and bud. A plastic spade and shovel with miniature handles and a set of tiny toads.

Before, at our cramped apartment, I had laid each of them out at the foot of her bed, burying the bugs and toads in her comforter. Setting up the flowers in their pieces, the blocks next to her dig site, and the bunny behind the rest – to watch over them all. And Win had the same routine every morning: as soon as she woke up she would take the spade and the shovel and dig out her friends. Finding them in the “dirt” and saying “there you are” with each one she unearthed.

She had a hard time saying “toad” so she said “frog” instead, or “fog” to be more precise. “Spider” was “Spider” but “Grasshopper” was “Grass-y-hopper”. The pink bunny was dubbed “Snacks” and she often talked to him as she dug up the rest of her friends with the plastic shovel and spade in her comforter, narrating her excavations aloud.

The first night we spent in that house, I decided to make a change. I took her baby blanket, the one she no longer slept with but still dragged around with her sometimes into our room or to take in front of the TV and buried her friends underneath. Taking them all over to her nook. Setting Snacks in the threshold of the door to lead the way.

The first morning she woke up in her own bed (getting her to sleep that night had been its own sort of trial), I watched from the doorway of her bedroom. My wife had left already as the sun was coming up so she could get ahead of traffic and I had a few hours more until I had to make a show of doing any sort of real work in my office downstairs.

So, I spent the beginning of my day watching my little girl wake up. Sitting up in her bed, watching the daze of sleep wear off as she looked around – half-wondering where she was in the same way we all do when we wake up some place new and strange.

I saw her look to the foot of her bed for her friends. Her puzzled expression at their absence lasted only a few moments before Snacks caught her eye, sitting in the corner; her fluffy pink sign that led to her own little rabbit hole, lighting the way.

I smiled, trying to stifle a pleased little chuckle, as I watched her get up. Her face lit up as she walked over to her nook to see what I had laid out there while she slept.

Just like that we had a new routine. Win had her own space to play – her own little chamber for her imagination. And it didn’t take her long at all to get to work. Talking aloud to Snacks, her sentences filling up more and more every day. My special gift so well received.

I wish I could have lived in that time forever.

I had no idea what the next few weeks had in store for me. For us.  Before the Lonely Way. Before Milkshake.

Because if I did know? I would have picked up my little girl in my arms and ran out of that house.

I would have run away and never looked back.

\*\*

“Babe?” Jess said, sticking her head out of our room.

I’d been carrying a few boxes into the storage room, the one we hadn’t decided what to do with yet. It might become an office, or a place for Jess to work if she was able to work from home anytime soon. Maybe a library like the one I always wanted as a kid. We had the books for it.

“Yeah,” I answered, setting down my load in the doorway. Win’s room was across the hall, the door shut. It was just after sundown and I could still hear the movie we’d left on for her on her tablet playing inside – she went through favorite films in waves, and the latest was Alice in Wonderland. I could see Alice trapped in the bottle from the other side of the door.

Still, I tried to keep my voice down.

“Come here,” Jess said, hushed. Her eyes were wide, her mouth open.

I didn’t like that look.

I made my way into our bedroom, quickly, my instinct telling me to shut the door behind me after I saw Jess’s expression. I was already preparing myself for some kind of bad news or the start of a fight, spinning, trying to think if there was something I said that I could get ahead of.

Instead, when I turned around, I saw our closet door was open. Jess standing right by it, her arms crossed. Pale.

The room had been an obvious pick for us when we toured the house. It was right across the hall from the bathroom, and even though we’d been wishing for an en suite, the walk-in closet had swayed us. It was huge, lined with shelves and rails for hangers, and slots for shoes. And Jess, being one of those rare breeds of women who owned a lot of clothes, had lit up almost as bright as when she’d seen Win’s room for the first time. I suppose the space was a kind of nook for her, a place she could fill with her own expression. I was happy to see that look then.

But that memory was losing its color now.

“What?” I said, still hushed, still in quiet Dad mode.

“I,” she said, blushing, “I was trying to fit some boxes up on the top shelf and I was shoving them back.”

I looked up to the farthest shelf at the back of the closet and saw what she was going to say even before she said it.

A section of the wall had slid to the side. What looked, upon our first inspection, to be a solid wall was actually a painted panel. It was hanging askew, the corner of it pushed into a darkened space that I didn’t know about.

“I’m sorry,” she said, “I think I, I don’t know, shouldn’t there be a wall there?”

“There should be,” I said, frowning. Stepping closer to the back of the closet.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. Mildew and old wood. Old paint. It made my nose itch and the back of my mouth water.

“I got some dust, or paint chips, or something on some of the boxes,” she said, behind me.

“That’s alright,” I said, half-paying attention. My gaze was focused on the corner of dark that appeared in the back of our closet.

I reached out, taking the loose panel in my hands. I tugged on it, lightly at first. It gave a little and I pulled harder until it was free.

“It’s plywood,” I said, “it’s like, really flimsy plywood.”

I turned around to her.

“Help me take some of these down really quick?”

She nodded, some of the worry fallen off of her face. She was with me, and I with her – both of us curious as hell.

It only took a few minutes to move most of what we’d stored in the closet aside, pushing everything as far back away from the wall as we could. When it was done, I moved next to the shadow square in our wall to try the panel next to it.

“I think they were nailed together once,” I said, feeling it come loose after a few careful tugs.'

“But why?” she asked, taking the panel with gentle hands and laying it next to us at the back of the closet.

It wasn’t much longer until we found our answer. There were four panels in all, each one pried free and laid beside us. Jess took out her phone, flicking open her flashlight and shining it inside.

It was an old staircase, dusty in the dark, with boarded steps rising at a sharp incline, summiting before a thick wooden panel covering a hatch above.

“An attic?” Jess said beside me. She sounded louder, close to me in the space.

I wondered if her heart was beating as fast as mine was.

In hindsight, it made sense – the slanted wall of Win's nook, her perfect little play place, must have been under the closet stairs: sloping down towards the carpet, the hidden stairs rising towards the ceiling on the wall’s other side.

“Well, we have to go up there,” Jess said beside me, taking a step forward.

“Hold on a second,” I said, trying to get in front of her, “we don’t know how sturdy those stairs are.”

But Jess was determined. And, in the half-decade we’d been married, I learned quite well that getting in her way when she made up her mind about something would do either of us any good. So I settled for following her, close behind, wincing as I put my foot on the bottom stair.

“There’s more plywood over the doorway,” she said, almost halfway up to the top.

“It looks like a milk snake,” I said, out loud, pushing the toy away from my face.

“Milkshake?” Win asked.

I looked at her, and even then it was hard not to break out into a smile. When she was a little girl, she came up with half-way names for things all the time. Bumblebees were “bumbbie-bees”. Rocks were “shocks”, and every car was a “tuck” unless it was mine, my old Corolla, which she called “Corolla”.

The echo of that small stretch of time, of who she was and who she had grown out of, lit a little mirth in me. I couldn’t help it.

“Sure darling,” I said, crouching down to meet her eyes, “Milkshake. Where did you get this?”

She took a few steps closer, taking the toy from my hand. I was glad to be rid of it. It felt cold despite where I’d found it – bent on the carpet in a wash of warm morning sun from the window.

“The toybox Daddy,” she said.

My frown returned and deeper this time. I’d only been up for an hour – reading emails and drinking coffee on the porch after Jess left. I never came into Win’s room until the sun was up, until I was sure she would be stirring out of sleep, just in case my little arrangement woke her up.

“There’s not a toybox honey,” I said, “maybe mom brought it in before she left for work?”

But Win shook her head.          

“There is,” she said.

“Where baby?” I asked. Craning my head around the room – taking in her bed, her closet. The nook.

“There *is*,” she said, louder this time, the edge of a rising tantrum cutting her words.

“Where Win?” I asked, ready for some kind of game. A toybox could be a closet drawer, it could be a shoe. It could be a pillowcase, and maybe Jess had snuck in in the middle of the night to slide the toy somewhere Win would find it. Maybe she was trying to get in herself on the game, her own little secret addition to the ritual.

“Show me then,” I said, ready to be led. I stuck out my hand.

Win took it, turning away from me and leading me to the nook. And those three steps across the carpet of her bedroom were the last easy ones I ever took there.

Because when we came to the nook, to the shadows nestled in its mouth, I saw something in the corner. A toybox, the wood slick and dark. Glistening, like a carapace, like black-licorice candy so freshly sucked.

Its lid was closed. I caught a whiff of something breathy. Of spoil and sick.

My heart dropped, my legs felt weak.

“Where did you get that?” I asked, almost automatically.

“It’s IN there,” Win said, I thought she said, stomping her foot, a habit she’d picked up from Jess when there was nothing else to do and she was overwhelmed. I flinched, I stared down at her, my breath catching.

“I know it’s in there,” I said, “but how- “

And that’s when I realized – I’d misheard her. She hadn’t said the toybox was *in* there. But that it had *been* there.

It’s been there. Been there all along.",5,1753296125.0,nosleep,2,0.86,False

The house was a steal.

Two stories, right in the middle of town. A winding staircase, the kind I always wish I had as a kid. Ample kitchen with brand new appliances and a ceiling in the living room I couldn’t reach even if I jumped with my arms up. It was an old house and it sat right in the middle of an equally old square in a town that was small enough and far enough away from the city you could see the stars at night, but not so small that we weren’t in walking distance from an old ice cream shop, a diner, a couple restaurants. Charm and character, in both the house and where it was located.

The house was ideal.  At least, it should have been.

It was a big step for the three of us. My wife and I and our daughter. Our only. She had just turned three and part of why we moved out of the city was for her – cliché reasons really, the kind you always hear when young parents migrate: the search for better schools, safety. Being closer to family.

But the other reasons were for us. We wanted a house we could afford, one that felt like we weren’t stuffing ourselves and our belongings inside like sardines. A place we could call our own, that we could fill with new and better memories.

It should have been that house.

I still remember walking into the room the day we met with our realtor.

“This is Win’s room,” Jess had said, almost as soon as she stepped in. And following her inside, I saw why.

The room was the second largest bedroom in the house. The color of the carpet was different – a verdant green. The windows were lower; with wide ledges I could just see becoming the perfect stages for Win’s already impressive collection of toys. An ample closet, the only one in the house that didn’t have any loose nails hanging from the paneled interior.

And then there was the nook.

We thought it was a second closet at first, just one without a door. It had a sloping roof that ran down one side of the small space to the carpeted floor. A perfect little play area, one we knew Win with her already exploding imagination could make her own. The kind of play space we both wish we would have had as kids. And it was right next door to our room, so we’d be able to hear her through the walls if she woke up in the middle of the night.

“Oh, good thinking,” the realtor said, smiling and stepping into the threshold of the nook with us, “this was the former owner’s kid’s room too. They left this here.”

She pointed to a section of the interior, wooden boards supporting a shelf near the entrance. There were names there, written in what looked like a pink magic marker. Candace. Marie. Next to each a date and what looked like at first glance to be dates. Written in cleaner script than the names, probably the parent’s handwriting.

“06/19/99” next to Candace.

“08/02/01” for Marie.

“I thought to leave that,” the realtor said, smiling at the way we were examining the names, “some houses need a little record of good memories.”

We agreed. And, in hindsight, seeing that room was what sold us. What helped us overlook the work we’d need to put into the place, the sloping floors next to the front door and the unfinished basement. The spackling it so badly needed, the doorknobs that needed replacing on nearly every door.

It was the idea that this house had already been lived in, that it had cherished memories in its bones. A feeling we thought to add to, a good kind of haunting. One we could add to.

The move was an ordeal for us. We weren’t exactly out in the boonies, but we were still pretty far from the city. My wife still had a job downtown and until she found something else would have to commute there and back – over an hour one way. She worked at a software company and recently got a promotion, which meant she had to work later as well. We shared a car since I started working from home, which meant the first few weeks after we moved she was gone for long stretches.

Sunup to sundown.

My work was pretty laid back, which was a blessing – it meant that I could watch Win during the day. Our parents weren’t far, and we could get either set of them to sit for us if we needed but – I don’t know. I guess I had this thought that I could really build some good memories with her those first few weeks. We’d been so caught up in life in the city, and our apartment there was so small. We'd nearly spent the entirety of our daughter's first three years on top of each other. I wanted to give her a space she could explore - a space she could settle into and find out was her own.

I wanted her to play.

“How did we live with all of this before?” Jess asked me. We were unpacking Win’s clothes and toys in her room while she watched TV downstairs. The TV was the first thing we had set up, and our daughter’s room was next on the list. Our things were still in boxes.

“I don’t know,” I said, unloading a box filled with stuffed animals and a variety of small, plastic bugs. She was a tomboy, and we knew that already. She was obsessed with bugs, with playing in the dirt. Animals. She had less of an interest in princesses and more of a taste for what lived in the dirt. For what lived under rocks.

“She’s going to grow out of all of this so fast,” Jess said, a little t-shirt in her hands as she folded it and put it in Win’s dresser, “in a few years we’ll just be packing all of this away and taking it to Goodwill.”

“I guess so,” I said, unpacking my own box, “or maybe we’ll find someone to give it all to. Hand-me-downs.”

“Maybe,” Jess said, her back still to me, “or maybe we’ll just hold on to them. In case we need some toddler clothes again in a couple of years.”

I looked at her, my face lighting up with a smile. Warmth shooting through me – giddy and sudden. She didn’t turn around, but I could tell she said it with a smile in her voice. We were going to make this place our home, a real home. We had years and years’ worth of dreaming to fill every corner of the house. We were going to grow our family here.

It was one of the first joyful moments in that new house.

Here was another:

Every night before we tucked Win into bed, I set out her toys for her in the morning. She had a few favorites – a pink bunny we thrifted while Jess was still pregnant, some bright and speckled blocks. A brown plastic spider, a green grasshopper. Plastic flowers she could take apart and put back together again – stem and leaf and bud. A plastic spade and shovel with miniature handles and a set of tiny toads.

Before, at our cramped apartment, I had laid each of them out at the foot of her bed, burying the bugs and toads in her comforter. Setting up the flowers in their pieces, the blocks next to her dig site, and the bunny behind the rest – to watch over them all. And Win had the same routine every morning: as soon as she woke up she would take the spade and the shovel and dig out her friends. Finding them in the “dirt” and saying “there you are” with each one she unearthed.

She had a hard time saying “toad” so she said “frog” instead, or “fog” to be more precise. “Spider” was “Spider” but “Grasshopper” was “Grass-y-hopper”. The pink bunny was dubbed “Snacks” and she often talked to him as she dug up the rest of her friends with the plastic shovel and spade in her comforter, narrating her excavations aloud.

The first night we spent in that house, I decided to make a change. I took her baby blanket, the one she no longer slept with but still dragged around with her sometimes into our room or to take in front of the TV and buried her friends underneath. Taking them all over to her nook. Setting Snacks in the threshold of the door to lead the way.

The first morning she woke up in her own bed (getting her to sleep that night had been its own sort of trial), I watched from the doorway of her bedroom. My wife had left already as the sun was coming up so she could get ahead of traffic and I had a few hours more until I had to make a show of doing any sort of real work in my office downstairs.

So, I spent the beginning of my day watching my little girl wake up. Sitting up in her bed, watching the daze of sleep wear off as she looked around – half-wondering where she was in the same way we all do when we wake up some place new and strange.

I saw her look to the foot of her bed for her friends. Her puzzled expression at their absence lasted only a few moments before Snacks caught her eye, sitting in the corner; her fluffy pink sign that led to her own little rabbit hole, lighting the way.

I smiled, trying to stifle a pleased little chuckle, as I watched her get up. Her face lit up as she walked over to her nook to see what I had laid out there while she slept.

Just like that we had a new routine. Win had her own space to play – her own little chamber for her imagination. And it didn’t take her long at all to get to work. Talking aloud to Snacks, her sentences filling up more and more every day. My special gift so well received.

I wish I could have lived in that time forever.

I had no idea what the next few weeks had in store for me. For us.  Before the Lonely Way. Before Milkshake.

Because if I did know? I would have picked up my little girl in my arms and ran out of that house.

I would have run away and never looked back.

\*\*

“Babe?” Jess said, sticking her head out of our room.

I’d been carrying a few boxes into the storage room, the one we hadn’t decided what to do with yet. It might become an office, or a place for Jess to work if she was able to work from home anytime soon. Maybe a library like the one I always wanted as a kid. We had the books for it.

“Yeah,” I answered, setting down my load in the doorway. Win’s room was across the hall, the door shut. It was just after sundown and I could still hear the movie we’d left on for her on her tablet playing inside – she went through favorite films in waves, and the latest was Alice in Wonderland. I could see Alice trapped in the bottle from the other side of the door.

Still, I tried to keep my voice down.

“Come here,” Jess said, hushed. Her eyes were wide, her mouth open.

I didn’t like that look.

I made my way into our bedroom, quickly, my instinct telling me to shut the door behind me after I saw Jess’s expression. I was already preparing myself for some kind of bad news or the start of a fight, spinning, trying to think if there was something I said that I could get ahead of.

Instead, when I turned around, I saw our closet door was open. Jess standing right by it, her arms crossed. Pale.

The room had been an obvious pick for us when we toured the house. It was right across the hall from the bathroom, and even though we’d been wishing for an en suite, the walk-in closet had swayed us. It was huge, lined with shelves and rails for hangers, and slots for shoes. And Jess, being one of those rare breeds of women who owned a lot of clothes, had lit up almost as bright as when she’d seen Win’s room for the first time. I suppose the space was a kind of nook for her, a place she could fill with her own expression. I was happy to see that look then.

But that memory was losing its color now.

“What?” I said, still hushed, still in quiet Dad mode.

“I,” she said, blushing, “I was trying to fit some boxes up on the top shelf and I was shoving them back.”

I looked up to the farthest shelf at the back of the closet and saw what she was going to say even before she said it.

A section of the wall had slid to the side. What looked, upon our first inspection, to be a solid wall was actually a painted panel. It was hanging askew, the corner of it pushed into a darkened space that I didn’t know about.

“I’m sorry,” she said, “I think I, I don’t know, shouldn’t there be a wall there?”

“There should be,” I said, frowning. Stepping closer to the back of the closet.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. Mildew and old wood. Old paint. It made my nose itch and the back of my mouth water.

“I got some dust, or paint chips, or something on some of the boxes,” she said, behind me.

“That’s alright,” I said, half-paying attention. My gaze was focused on the corner of dark that appeared in the back of our closet.

I reached out, taking the loose panel in my hands. I tugged on it, lightly at first. It gave a little and I pulled harder until it was free.

“It’s plywood,” I said, “it’s like, really flimsy plywood.”

I turned around to her.

“Help me take some of these down really quick?”

She nodded, some of the worry fallen off of her face. She was with me, and I with her – both of us curious as hell.

It only took a few minutes to move most of what we’d stored in the closet aside, pushing everything as far back away from the wall as we could. When it was done, I moved next to the shadow square in our wall to try the panel next to it.

“I think they were nailed together once,” I said, feeling it come loose after a few careful tugs.'

“But why?” she asked, taking the panel with gentle hands and laying it next to us at the back of the closet.

It wasn’t much longer until we found our answer. There were four panels in all, each one pried free and laid beside us. Jess took out her phone, flicking open her flashlight and shining it inside.

It was an old staircase, dusty in the dark, with boarded steps rising at a sharp incline, summiting before a thick wooden panel covering a hatch above.

“An attic?” Jess said beside me. She sounded louder, close to me in the space.

I wondered if her heart was beating as fast as mine was.

“Yeah,” I said, shaking my head, “an attic.”

In hindsight, it made sense – the slanted wall of Win's nook, her perfect little play place, must have been under the closet stairs: sloping down towards the carpet, the hidden stairs rising towards the ceiling on the wall’s other side.

“Well, we have to go up there,” Jess said beside me, taking a step forward.

“Hold on a second,” I said, trying to get in front of her, “we don’t know how sturdy those stairs are.”

But Jess was determined. And, in the half-decade we’d been married, I learned quite well that getting in her way when she made up her mind about something would do either of us any good. So I settled for following her, close behind, wincing as I put my foot on the bottom stair.

“There’s more plywood over the doorway,” she said, almost halfway up to the top.

“I know,” I said, “hey, maybe we should wait until morning. Maybe it’s filled in or something.”

“People fill in pools, not attics,” she said.

I shrugged.

“Besides,” she went on, her fingers splaying wide over the piece of wood above her, “I’m not going to sleep in this room for one second knowing there’s some fucking secret space above me.”

And she had a good point there.

I met her at the top of the stairs, both of us leaning against the walls of the narrow flight and helped her push the piece of wood up. It was heavier than the false panels we had taken out of the closet, and we both put our shoulders into it, genuinely straining.

But then the wood gave and – together – we stared into the unknown dark.

“Oh my god,” Jess said, steering her flashlight up and into the black, “oh my fucking god.”

It was an attic alright. Bare wooden beams from the underside of the roof crisscrossed above us. High above us. As we stepped farther up the steps and Jess’s beam showed farther the way forward, we fell into a shocked silence.

It was fucking huge.

And absolutely empty – Jess’s light stretched into the far corners of the space. It was unfinished but not unwalkable – wooden floorboards lined the floor, placed in careful precision.  Looking around, both of us quiet and wide-eyed, we didn’t see a single item. Not a single abandoned box or ancient chest, dress form, or pile of coats. Nothing.

It was a giant, extra room the size of our three bedrooms put together, hidden above us the whole week we’d been living in our new home.

“Babe,” she said, turning to me, both of us smushed up against each other standing halfway out of the stair into the new place, “did we just win a bonus attic?”

I smiled, even in the dark, even though the dark, musty air made my eyes water.

“Yeah,” I said, “I think we did.”

\*\*

Look, I know – I’ve seen horror movies. I’ve seen the one where the new family moves into the new house and everything seems perfect until…

Well, we all know what could be hiding at the end of that thought.  

I’d be lying if I said that the thought didn’t cross my mind while taking apart the panels at the back of the closet. And again at some point through the following weeks. It was a persistent echo, a little whisper in the back of my head growing long in tooth and throat, harder and harsher.

Until it was too late. Until it was screaming.

But you know what scares away the spookies? Sitting up in bed with Jess that night, talking way later than we meant to, dreaming while awake about all of the things we could do with that attic – a playroom, a bigger office, a super-cool bedroom for Win when she got older. We imagined our girl as a full-blown teenager, sneaking out of the tiny attic window we spotted in the far corner to the roof, climbing down the tree in the front yard to meet her friends for some late-night teenager mischief.

There were other joys too. Win’s growing routine in her nook, the way she looked up at us and smiled after running around in the backyard and turning over rocks for earthworms. The way the sun came in the kitchen and lit Jess’s face up on the slow mornings we had most weekends. The walk we all took together down the street, noticing how close we were to the elementary school even if the years when we’d need to think about that seemed so far away. So measured.

I was even starting to love the way the floorboards creaked on the stairs on my way down each morning. All of the sounds the old house made were little symphonies. Accompanying our shared and growing chord that this boon, this place we found and were both so willing to fall in love with, was our home.

A house is what you put in it, and we put in a lot of love and hope in those early days. I wish it would have caught. I wish it had been enough.

But life’s not like that. Our house…our *home*, wouldn't allow our dream to last. I’ve always wanted to tell a story, and I thought the story that was unfolding for us in that precious time would be one of happiness – of joy and growth and life. That was the story I wanted to hold within me.

That was the story I thought I deserved to tell.

But instead, it goes like this:

A couple weeks later I woke in the middle of the night, shooting straight up in bed. An aching peal shook me from a dream. It was decidedly new – a slow, hollow ache – not like the stairs or the walls settling, not like the tinkering branches dancing along the side of the house in the wind. It was a yawn, wooden, a long and mournful creak.

I sat there in the dark with Jess deep asleep beside me and listened for a moment – unsure of its origin, or if it was even real. I was having a nightmare, I remember, where I was locked away somewhere in the dark. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t move, and all around me were muffled voices I could almost recognize. They murmured – obscure, strange in tone, and soaked by sorrow.

I ignored it then. Thinking it must have been another voice joining the strange chorus of this old house. But come morning while arranging Win’s toys for her, I found something odd.

I found a new toy in my daughter’s room – one I didn’t remember laying out for her.

There, on the carpet, was a stuffed snake. Crocheted with yarn made of old brittle wool, it looked home-made, but never in our home. I bent down to pick it up, grasping its limp length. As I did, I felt it *crunch* in my grasp.

Its pattern was like a milk snake’s. But off-colored – the hallmark yellow and orange pattern along the spine instead an array of grey hues. Shades of ash standing out against its black, curling length.

Only the eyes looked real. Litle red beads ruby bright even in the shadow of the nook.

“Daddy?” Win asked.

I turned around to see her standing behind me. She was rubbing her eyes and looking at the thing in my hand.

“Honey,” I said, confused, “what is this?”

She shrugged. I looked down at it again, frowning, catching a whiff of something lousy. I brought it to my nose and breathed in, hard.  

It smelled like mildew. Like wet and damp. Like somewhere old.

“It looks like a milk snake,” I said, out loud, pushing the toy away from my face.

“Milkshake?” Win asked.

I looked at her, and even then it was hard not to break out into a smile. When she was a little girl, she came up with half-way names for things all the time. Bumblebees were “bumbbie-bees”. Rocks were “shocks”, and every car was a “tuck” unless it was mine, my old Corolla, which she called “Corolla”.

The echo of that small stretch of time, of who she was and who she had grown out of, lit a little mirth in me. I couldn’t help it.

“Sure darling,” I said, crouching down to meet her eyes, “Milkshake. Where did you get this?”

She took a few steps closer, taking the toy from my hand. I was glad to be rid of it. It felt cold despite where I’d found it – bent on the carpet in a wash of warm morning sun from the window.

“The toybox Daddy,” she said.

My frown returned and deeper this time. I’d only been up for an hour – reading emails and drinking coffee on the porch after Jess left. I never came into Win’s room until the sun was up, until I was sure she would be stirring out of sleep, just in case my little arrangement woke her up.

“There’s not a toybox honey,” I said, “maybe mom brought it in before she left for work?”

But Win shook her head.          

“There is,” she said.

“Where baby?” I asked. Craning my head around the room – taking in her bed, her closet. The nook.

“There *is*,” she said, louder this time, the edge of a rising tantrum cutting her words.

“Where Win?” I asked, ready for some kind of game. A toybox could be a closet drawer, it could be a shoe. It could be a pillowcase, and maybe Jess had snuck in in the middle of the night to slide the toy somewhere Win would find it. Maybe she was trying to get in herself on the game, her own little secret addition to the ritual.

“Show me then,” I said, ready to be led. I stuck out my hand.

Win took it, turning away from me and leading me to the nook. And those three steps across the carpet of her bedroom were the last easy ones I ever took there.

Because when we came to the nook, to the shadows nestled in its mouth, I saw something in the corner. A toybox, the wood slick and dark. Glistening, like a carapace, like black-licorice candy so freshly sucked.

Its lid was closed. I caught a whiff of something breathy. Of spoil and sick.

My heart dropped, my legs felt weak.

“Where did you get that?” I asked, almost automatically.

“It’s IN there,” Win said, I thought she said, stomping her foot, a habit she’d picked up from Jess when there was nothing else to do and she was overwhelmed. I flinched, I stared down at her, my breath catching.

“I know it’s in there,” I said, “but how- “

TL;DR at the bottom

I’m a Dallas born and bred hoops fan who’s been feeling a little lost. Grew up watching the Mavs and used to attend their youth camp around the time Dirk got drafted. I remember going to games at Reunion Arena before the AAC was built. Remember the agonizing heartbreak of losing the ‘06 Finals. Dirk’s MVP season. And of course the glory of the incredible 2011 title run. We had some rough years at the end of Dirk’s career with a handful of exciting players, but none that could compare to some young Slovenian kid we got in 2018. 

I didn’t know a lot about Luka when we drafted him. I was cautiously optimistic and thought maybe he was slightly overrated, but believed he would at least pan out to be a potential all-star caliber player after a few years in the league. Of course I don’t need to explain how that turned out. 

In 2018 if you asked any local who’s the face of Dallas sports, they would have said Dirk. And much like Dirk’s legacy, Luka started building one of his own from day 1. Fast forward to the end of the 2024 season - Luka is the pinnacle of Dallas sports culture and arguably more popular than Dirk ever was, even fresh off our 2011 chip. 

I was hanging out with a childhood best friend who’s also a die-hard Luka fan when we read the Shams tweet. Not hyperbole, it felt like finding out a close friend or relative died. I’m sure a lot of you read the posts and fallout over in r/Mavericks afterwards. I’ve never felt so disgusted by anything in sports in my life and for a solid month it was the very first thing I thought of when I’d wake up in the morning.

I’ll never forget nor forgive the Mavs FO for betraying Mavs fans everywhere. I went from watching every single game to having zero interest whatsoever. The only games I could stomach were against the Lakers to watch Luka pop off and stick it to the people who dealt him. As a huge Luka fan, I finally understand and (sadly) relate to LeBron stans who only had allegiance to a player, not a team. Problem is, fuck rooting for the Lakers. Luka could go anywhere else and I’d sign over my fandom - even if he somehow landed in SA next to Wemby. But that’s not the reality. 

I still strongly support the core of the current Mavs roster that surrounded Luka while I was a fan, and wish those players tons of success. But even with the crazy coincidence of landing Flagg in the draft and watching him in summer league, I just can’t support the Mavs while Nico and the current owners are around. Seeing some fans “get over it” grosses me out. I want to watch and enjoy the NBA again and have a team to support, so naturally I’ve been looking around and I really dig the Blazers. 

I have some great memories of visiting Oregon as a kid and became a fan of Portland by way of Portlandia (corny, I know) and friends’ anecdotal experiences of trips up there. Last year I finally got to visit your beautiful city and had an absolute blast. The food, the parks, the music venues, the theaters, the neighborhoods, the thriving small businesses, the feeling of a strong community… I’d never been anywhere like it. Went back in April and loved it even more - even got to check out the Ladd’s 500 and take a few laps with a beer in hand. I’m now seriously looking at moving there. 

Basketball wise, you guys seem to have a positive reputation as a die-hard fanbase and yet you’re not obnoxious af like some other places (e.g. OKC). I’ve always been a huge Dame fan and I’m so happy he’s coming back and hopefully going to finish his career at home. Despite leaving briefly, his loyalty to his city is reminiscent of Dirk’s. Not to mention the low-key stacked roster y’all have built, especially with Hansen coming in. I’m honestly WAY more stoked to see his career arc than Flagg’s. I also love that y’all are a smaller market team with a chip on your shoulder. Even though Dallas is a huge market, I know what that’s like. Dirk and the Mavs were constantly disrespected and dismissed until 2011. Embracing that negativity and turning it into “fuck you” energy can be a lot of fun. 

I guess what I’m saying is, I’m sad to be turning away from the team I grew up with and I’ll always be rooting for Luka’s success (again, fuck LA), but I’m excited to jump on the Blazers bandwagon indefinitely. I’m planning to visit PDX again in the fall and hope to make a visit to the Moda Center, dressed appropriately. Who knows, I might even finally move out of Texas and find myself in my favorite city in the country 🌹🌹🌹

Thanks for reading. I just slammed a ton of coffee so apologies for the long ass post. Cheers y’all 

TL;DR - Fuck Nico, fuck the Adelson family and fuck having to watch Luka wear purple and gold. I got a new team now.

He’s really cute and we get along so well. We laugh a lot together, we get each others’ sense of humour and have a lot in common. I truly enjoy his company and can see us being friends outside of the doctors office.

We constantly flirt with each other, and while I enjoy it and think it’s fun, I was under the impression that he is gay so I never put any stock into it. 

Here’s my dilemma: on my last visit, he asked me if I have a boyfriend. The question was thrown into a joke about something else so I didn’t answer. Then he ended our visit by saying that the next time we see each other, we should go for coffee.

It might be innocent, but I’m pretty sure that was his way of asking me out. The vibes were heavy in flirtation mode when he said it. I kind of breezed through it by saying « sounds good »

If the coffee thing does happen, can I bring up the fact that I think he’s gay? I need clarity. 
I’m not looking for a fun time, I’m dating to find a husband. If he is straight, I’d definitely give him a chance.

1m7h74x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1m7h74x/how_to_overcome_the_fear_of_death_its_unyielding/,How to overcome the fear of death - it's unyielding.,"\*\* Trigger Warning - Death  
Hello everyone,

  I'm coming to this thread because I don't know how to cope with or manage my fear of death and I'm hoping that some of you may have overcome this or know someone who has and can offer advice.  
  I'll try to make this quick! I've suffered with anxiety and depression as far back as I can remember - officially diagnosed by my pediatrician when I was in 6th grade. I've always been able to manage it myself with brief periods here and there of it feeling out of control but I've always been able to, with help from friends and family, be okay. In 2023, I became pregnant and I've never felt better. I'm not sure if it was instinct to protect my little one, if something changed in my brain - I have no idea but I hadn't felt so in control of my mental health in my entire life. About 3 - 4 months after my son was born, I remember laying on the couch and having an uncontrollable thought - ""What will my last day on Earth be like?"" and since then, I have not been able to escape this escalating fear of death.   
  I've tried everything I can think of outside of seeking professional help. I've told myself that worrying about it won't change anything, that it's probably way more normal for this to have happened because now I'm a parent and life means so much more, that I'm not dying today so I shouldn't spend time being anxious about it but nothing seems to help. I know that this is something that will happen to all of us collectively, I know that I should be enjoying and squeezing out every ounce of joy that life has to offer but I can't escape this fear. It's taken me a long time to even sit down and type this out and, as I am, my chest feels extremely tight and it's hard to breathe. 

  I'm a stay at home Mom and I'm desperately trying to fill my days because any moment where there's quiet, the thoughts creep in. Before nap time, we do quiet time in my son's room where the lights are dimmed and it makes me anxious - it's so quiet that it gives me time to reflect and these thoughts of ""what if something happens to me and I can't be here for him"" or ""how much time do I have left with him"" - it's awful. I have to watch something to go to sleep because, if not, I'll give in to these thoughts and cry myself to sleep. If I wake up in the middle of the night to drink water or use the restroom, I immediately think to myself ""Great, now how can I avoid these thoughts so I can go back to sleep?"". My husband is encouraging me, softly, to face this fear but how do I overcome something that is 100% going to happen and I'm terrified of it. I try to be logical, try to get up and breathe and name five things I can see, try to instead reflect on how wonderful it is that I get to experience this life with people I love and care about, try to enjoy the little things like a good cup of coffee or sunshine or my son's laughter but in those quiet spaces, the fear lingers. I feel like I can't control my thoughts surrounding the fear and I'm tired, scared and desperate to heal this part of me. I don't want to feel this way - I want and need to overcome it. I want to enjoy my life and my family - it's such a waste of time to be so horribly anxious and it's honestly just so cryptic.   
  Most of all, if my son ever develops anxiety or depression, I want to do the work of figuring out how to handle this so that he doesn't have to. I want to heal myself so that if my son struggles, we know exactly how to help and we can do as much as we can.   
Please, if you have any advice, I would so vey much appreciate you sharing. ",3,1753295544.0,Anxiety,4,1.0,False

“Ella, hurry up or you’re going to be late for school!” This is the second time my mother has yelled upstairs for me, but I just sit here, on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall.

I tell myself that it’s going to be a good day, but who am I kidding? I haven’t had a good day at school in two years. Only six more months left of my senior year, and then it will be all over. I’m not sure how I feel about it yet, and that’s the most messed up part. I’m eighteen years old, about to graduate high school, and I have a full scholarship to pretty much any college I want to go.

My name is Ella Baxter and I’m a nerd who has no friends, I never break any rules, and I have a deep need to please everyone, but myself. I haven’t always been this way, but circumstances bring on change, and for me, it was not for the better. I used to have a lot of friends; two of them being my best friends, Amy and Bree. We were inseparable throughout middle school and junior high. It wasn’t until the beginning of sophomore year when I had to distance myself from everyone in my life except for my family.

“Honey! Are you coming down or not?” Once again, my mother’s voice reaches me. Sighing, I reach down, grabbing my backpack, and head down before mom has a coronary.

I paste a smile on my face as I round the corner to the kitchen, where my younger sister and brother sit with a bowl of cereal. Eli, my nine-year-old brother has his bowl tipped back as he slurps the milk out. Meanwhile, my fifteen-year-old sister, Elise, is dripping milk on the table every time she spoons the cereal into her mouth because her eyes are glue to her cellphone. This is an everyday occurrence in the Baxter household.

I roll my eyes and lean down, giving my dad a kiss on his cheek, “Good morning, daddy.”

“Morning, sweetie, did you oversleep again?” His concern for my wellbeing is written all over his face. I’ve always been his little girl, and it shows in the way he babies me over everything. I don’t complain though, because I need all the love and attention that I can get these days.

“No, daddy.” I don’t add anything else, but I do smile at him. I could have lied and made something up, but again, I’m a goodie goodie; I would never lie to my parents. He only hesitates a moment before going back to his newspaper.

Taking my seat beside my dad, my mother sets my two slices of peanut butter toast and a banana down in front of me. Unlike my siblings, I’m not a fan of cold cereal. I prefer something more substantial in my stomach before starting a grueling day at school.

“This is the third day in a row that I had to holler for you to come down more than once, Ella,” Mom takes her place across from me, on my father’s other side, as she sips her black coffee, “Please don’t make it a habit, my throat is starting to hurt.”

My father chuckles behind his paper, earning himself a slap on the arm from his wife, “Behave, Ethan!”

I’ve been around my parents enough to know how they are. They are both in their early forties, and still have their good looks. Unfortunately, they also still have a high sex drive, so I can only imagine what my dad’s chuckle was insinuating. Being around them every day, you get used to it. Besides, I think it’s so cute that, even after all these years, they are still madly in love with one another. I hope I find a love like theirs in my lifetime.

“Oh! Before I forget,” Mom turns back to me, “I have a PTA meeting at Eli’s school this evening. I’ll have a casserole in the oven but will need you to make sure your brother and sister eat.”

“Sure, no problem.” My mom is always volunteering here and there, and she is the head of the PTA, so she is always busy with that. “Will you be home for supper, dad?”

“I’m not sure, honey. I have a meeting with a client, and it may run late. Just put a plate in the warmer for me if I don’t make it in time.” I nod. My dad is a partner at his Law Firm, so it’s no surprise when he doesn’t make it home on time. Sometimes my mom will bring dinner to him and his client if the meeting runs over.

Finishing up the last of my breakfast, I take my plate to the dishwasher and then scoop my bag up, “The train is leaving!” I call out to Eli and Elise. Driving them to school every morning is our little morning ritual. It’s the only time that we get with each other these days. Elise is always busy with her friends, now that she’s a freshman, and Eli locks himself in his room and plays video games all evening.

As soon as we get into the car, Elise cranks up the radio, and our morning karaoke session begins. Ed Sheeran’s song, Shivers, my sister’s favorite song, is playing, and she squeals. She starts to dance as she belts out the words, and I can’t help but to laugh as I watch her strawberry blonde curls bounce around. Her blue eyes sparkle when they find mine, and she gives me a big smile. Unlike some sisters, we actually get along very well, but it’s times like this that I envy her innocence. I hope she never has to experience a day of what my life is like, because I’m afraid it may break her.

The second bell that starts the first class of the day is about to ring as I slam my locker closed. With my laptop bag slung across my body, I quickly make my way to my first class before anybody can stop me. Mr. Miller, our math teacher, sits at his desk, shuffling through papers while we all file into the room. I breathe a sigh of relief once my butt touches my chair, knowing that for the next ninety minutes, I’ll have some semblance of peace.

Unfortunately, Mr. Miller had us working on our next assignment, which kept me busy through the whole class, and before I know it, the bell rings. Packing my laptop away, I turn to leave and accidentally bump into someone, I curse under my breath when I see who it is.

“Watch where you’re going, nerd!” Kaylee Simpson glares at me as though I had done it on purpose.

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.”

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.” She mimics and then shoves past me, “How about you accidentally jump off a bridge?” Her friend, Callie, snickers at her lame attempt to insult me as they walk out.

Bumping into the captain of the school’s dance team first thing in the morning pretty much tells me exactly what kind of day I’m going to have. Kaylee doesn’t even know why she hates me so much. We used to be acquaintances, not really running in the same crowd, but still talking between classes and outside of school. Now she treats me like the dirt under her feet. Like everybody else, she dropped me like last season’s fashion line two years ago. One Friday night we were talking at a friend’s party, and then come Monday morning, Kaylee and most of the senior class started to ignore me. It had only taken about a week, and then the rest of the school abandoned me as well. That’s when it all started; it’s when Jace Palmer decided to make my life hell.

# Chapter 2 Friends No More - Pt.

As next door neighbors, Jace and I grew up playing together. Our parents are very good friends and were always bringing our families together for summer barbeques, holidays, birthdays, anything…you name it…our families celebrated together. Jace knows everything about me, and I, him, since we were best friends; wherever Jace was, I was right there with him. That is until we entered our sophomore year in high school. It was as though he had developed amnesia and didn’t remember that we were best friends.

I remember as if it were only yesterday. It was the third Friday after the school year had started, and we had hung with a group of friends after school let out for the weekend. We were excited and talking about the party we were all going to that night. As always, Jace had driven us over to the party. I was having a good time even though I wasn’t drinking any of the alcohol that was available to us, but Jace was. Not that it was unusual for him to be drinking, because I was always the DD for him afterwards.

At one point, I spotted Jace standing in a corner talking to some girl named Madison, that had just moved to town. Her and her brother were fraternal twins, but complete opposites. Her brother, Mason, was more on the wild side, and a bit cocky, whereas she was more reserved. It looked like Jace was enjoying the conversation, so I wandered around, stopping a few times to chit chat. When Mason had stopped me, he handed me a bottle of water, and I remember thinking to myself that it was very kind of him to notice that I wasn’t drinking.

The night went on, and Mason stuck to my side, flirting with me the whole time. Kaylee had come over, and we talked for a good thirty minutes before she moved on to talk to others. When I looked around the room, Jace was nowhere to be seen. The party was slowly dwindling down when Mason asked if I needed a ride home. I had thanked him and told him that Jace was my ride, but then he informed me that Jace already left the party with his sister. That hadn’t sat well with me, because it wasn’t like him to just up and leave without telling me.

I began searching the house for him, because I just couldn't believe that he had left me stranded. When I couldn’t find him, I looked outside for his car, but it was gone, the spot where he parked was empty. I tried calling his cell phone, but it kept going straight to voicemail. I was officially pissed off with my best friend, and he was going to get an earful when I talked to him the next day. I had no choice but to take Mason up on his offer to drive me home.

After giving Mason my address, I buckled myself into the passenger seat and tried texting Jace, but he never replied back. Messaging him on social media had the same outcome, although, with those messages, I could see that he was reading them, but ignoring me completely. I started to become worried, and when I lifted my head to say something to Mason about Jace ignoring me, I noticed that he wasn’t heading to my house. Instead, he was pulling into a secluded area where teenagers go to make-out or just get laid.

There were a few other cars in the clearing as we pulled in and he parked his car. I had tried to tell him that I wanted to go home, that I didn’t want to be there with him. He tried to sweet talk me into staying, and eventually told me that he would only take me home if I gave him a kiss. What’s one little kiss going to do, right? I gave in and leaned over to give him a quick kiss, but he grabbed me and hauled me over the middle counsel, and crashed his mouth against mine.

I started to object when he took the opportunity to shove his tongue into my mouth. He was stealing the kind of kiss that I was saving for someone special. My fists started pounding against his chest, trying to get him to stop. With all of my thrashing around, I somehow got him between the legs with one of my limbs, causing him to grunt and pull back. Climbing back to the passenger side, I had demanded that he take me back home right away. After glaring at me for a moment, and then a few curse words, he started his car, and took me home.

When we pulled up in front of my house, I could see that Jace’s bedroom light was on. I grabbed the door handle and went to open it, but Mason locked it before I was able to. He tried apologizing for his actions, explaining that he really liked me and wanted me to give him a chance. It wasn’t until I agreed to think about it, that he unlocked the door so I could get out. I was trying to hurry because I wanted to try calling Jace again, but then I notice that his bedroom light was now off, and flooded in darkness. Sighing, I went inside and went to bed myself. I never did get to talk to Jace the next day, or the day after that, and by the end of my first class on Monday morning, I was officially ostracized.

# Chapter 3 Obey Me - Pt. 1

I spend my school days trying to avoid Jace. Luckily, I only have one class with him, and that is last period Study Hall. Most of the time I skip it because I’m so far ahead in my schoolwork that the teachers don’t bother me about leaving. Today was like any other day, I quickly make my way through the halls, avoiding the areas that I know Jace tends to be in. Sometimes I get lucky and make it, and sometimes I don’t.

Watching where I’m going, while zigzagging through the halls, and staying aware of my surroundings, I suddenly feel a tight grip around my arm. I’m yanked into the now empty Art room, and tossed against the wall. The lock clicks, and then I’m staring into a pair of green eyes as the person turns my way. Jace has a smirk on his face as he looks me up and down. He normally slams me against lockers, trips me, and even steals my things, tossing them around with his friends, playing keep-away, like they were kids. This is a new low for him, though.

I’ve done everything possible: refined my resume, crafted tailored cover letters with the right keywords to get through ATS systems, and aligned every detail to the job description. I’ve reached out to recruiters, analyzed which applications led to interviews, and committed myself fully to the job search for over a year and seven months.

Last year, I even conducted a full self-evaluation to better understand how I was spending my time. I did a personal 360 review for all of 2024 and found that over 50% of my time was spent applying for jobs. The rest went toward maintaining my mental health at the gym and supporting my Aunt and Uncle. I built structure and held myself accountable, doing everything within my power to improve my chances.

During this time, the gym has been my only consistent mental break, Monday through Saturday. While I do my best to stay optimistic, the truth is I’m scared. I’m running out of options and on the brink of homelessness. I’ve exhausted my savings and cut back on nearly all social interactions to stretch every dollar. Coffee helps keep me going, and I often limit my food just to get by.

This has been the hardest period of my life.

And my intuition keeps telling me something deeper is going on. Maybe there simply aren’t enough jobs, or the AT system itself is broken. It’s not just me. I’ve spoken to so many qualified, hard-working people in the same situation. We are doing all the right things: tailoring resumes, networking, staying positive, yet doors remain closed. It’s exhausting, and it makes you question whether the job market is truly based on merit anymore or if we are stuck in a system that no longer works for the people who built it.

I’m currently reaching out to Recruiting agencies in San Francisco to look new Opportunies, that may help build & align a potential partnership with companies hiring and looking for C-level support & business operations.

One product category experiencing resurgence in vending machines is toys and collectibles. Machines offering mystery boxes, playing cards, or limited-edition action figures attract both kids and adults, tapping into the growing collectibles market. For example, machines that dispense small action figures, keychains, or plush toys have been incredibly successful in high-traffic areas like malls, arcades, and theme parks. The low cost of production combined with a high mark-up makes these items particularly profitable. With the growth of fandom culture and the appeal of collectibles, this product category is expected to continue its upward trajectory in 2025.

# Hot Foods: The Future of Convenience Dining

Hot food vending machines are gaining traction, especially in areas with high foot traffic such as airports, office buildings, and universities. From pizza to gourmet ramen and burritos, these machines offer freshly prepared meals without the need for a restaurant visit. Machines like the “Let’s Pizza” in Europe make personal-sized pizzas in under three minutes, while similar concepts offer hot burgers, soups, and sandwiches. As more consumers seek fast, convenient meals, hot food vending machines could be among the most profitable options due to their premium pricing and the growing demand for quick dining alternatives​.

# Hot Drinks: A Comforting Trend on the Rise

Another rising trend in vending machines is the inclusion of hot drinks, particularly premium coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Machines offering fresh-brewed, barista-quality coffee have become a hit in places like office buildings, transit stations, and universities, where consumers appreciate a quick caffeine fix. These machines often allow for customization, enabling customers to select their preferred type of coffee, milk, or flavorings. Given the growing global love for specialty coffee and the convenience of on-demand drinks, hot drink vending machines are proving to be both popular and profitable. With demand for coffee expected to remain strong in 2025, this product category presents a lucrative opportunity for businesses.

# Cold Foods and Healthy Options: Meeting the Demand for Freshness

Health-conscious consumers are driving the demand for vending machines offering fresh salads, sandwiches, and smoothies. These machines are often found in gyms, corporate offices, and health clinics where customers prefer nutritious options over sugary snacks. The shift toward healthier lifestyles opens opportunities for vending businesses to offer cold-pressed juices, protein bars, and even gluten-free or vegan meals. As workplace wellness programs expand and the demand for healthier, on-the-go foods rises, cold food vending machines are poised to become a profitable and sustainable investment​.

# Medicinal and Health-Related Products

Vending machines offering over-the-counter medicines such as pain relievers, allergy tablets, or first-aid supplies are becoming common in airports, malls, and gyms. The convenience of being able to purchase items like ibuprofen or band-aids without visiting a pharmacy is incredibly valuable, especially in emergency situations. Additionally, machines providing wellness products like CBD oils and vitamins cater to a growing segment of consumers focused on personal health. These high-margin products can offer significant profits, particularly when placed in well-trafficked locations​.

# Company Swag: Branding on the Go

Custom vending machines that sell company-branded merchandise (swag) are a growing trend, particularly at events and corporate headquarters.

1m7h0h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TripWanderers/comments/1m7h0h4/where_do_famous_people_go_in_orlando/,Where do famous people go in Orlando?,"Just got back from an incredible week exploring Orlando's hotspots, and I've got to share where celebrities actually hang out when they visit. It's not always where you'd expect!

I've been living in Orlando for years, and one spot that consistently attracts A-listers is the Four Seasons Resort at Walt Disney World. Last month, I spotted John Travolta in the lobby - he's known to be a regular guest. The resort's rooftop restaurant, Capa, is particularly popular with celebs looking for privacy and those stunning Disney fireworks views.

Discovery Cove is another celebrity magnet. Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel were spotted here last year. It makes sense - it's more exclusive than typical theme parks, with limited daily attendance and private cabanas. Plus, who doesn't want to swim with dolphins?

But here's something interesting - many celebrities are actually skipping the typical tourist spots and heading to the outskirts of Orlando for more authentic experiences. The Everglades airboat tours have become increasingly popular with famous visitors. I recently took one of these tours (https://athometouch.com/Orlando) and our guide mentioned how they've hosted several Hollywood stars who want to experience ""real Florida.""

Winter Park, just north of downtown Orlando, is another celebrity haven. The upscale Park Avenue area is where you might spot locals like Joey Fatone grabbing coffee at Barnie's or shopping at the boutiques. The Alfond Inn here regularly hosts celebrity guests who prefer its boutique atmosphere over larger hotels.

For dining, Victoria & Albert's at Disney's Grand Floridian is a major celebrity spot. It's one of only a handful of AAA Five Diamond restaurants in Florida. Jimmy Fallon was seen there during his last Orlando visit.

Universal CityWalk's The Palm restaurant is another favorite. The walls are covered with caricatures of famous guests who've dined there. It's especially busy during film premieres at Universal Studios.

Speaking of Universal, celebrities filming at the parks often stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. The Gibson Presidential Suite there has hosted everyone from rock stars to movie actors.

Lake Nona's booming restaurant scene is attracting more famous residents and visitors lately. Norman's is particularly popular with golf celebrities, given the area's prestigious golf courses.

If you're really interested in spotting celebrities while experiencing something unique, I highly recommend that Everglades tour I mentioned earlier. It's away from the tourist crowds, and you might just end up on an airboat with someone famous! The tour company (book here: https://athometouch.com/Orlando) is actually run by a local family that's been featured in several TV shows.

One last insider tip: Many celebrities visit during off-peak seasons (September-November) when the crowds are smaller. That's also when you'll get the best deals on attractions and accommodations.

Remember though - if you do spot a celebrity, be respectful of their privacy. That's why they choose these locations in the first place!",1,1753295139.0,TripWanderers,0,1.0,False

# Character One: Beginning of SP-01

Glorsku General:

Comrades and comrades!

I stand here before you as the commander of the Portal Star project, established right here in liberated Glorsku - in a country that only a few months ago was bleeding under the boot of Nazi oppression.

This place, where we now gather, was recently shaken by artillery fire during the Prague offensive. Well today - today we are here as free people. Not as victors over one regime, but as pioneers of a new era, an era of revolutionary science and socialist progress.

If the Nazi command had claimed authority over Lieutenant Białyslaw Pańtwosky, make no doubt about it - their Gestapo would have dragged Captains GG-02 and GG-03 into my command room. And in the worst case - it also executed them. But our men would face death without hesitation - because we are revolutionaries, not slaves!

Today we face a new threat. Not with a swastika, but with a dark force from beyond the stars.

Bram's weapon—that diabolical machine that creates portal passages between worlds—is a tool that can fall into the wrong hands. But know that an electromagnetic pulse, properly directed, can stop its entire course. Just as one single person can stand in the way of evil.

We have to learn from it. Comrades! We can resist. Not just alien invaders. Not just imperialist capitalism. But also despair, betrayal, indifference! And if we meet fascists, Americans, or capitalists in need - we will help them. Not because of them, but because of humanity itself. Because a true revolutionary knows that a person is more than an ideology.

Revolution does not spread by force, comrades. We don't need tanks to spread the truth. Our enemies - not excluding the Americans - may tempt the world, but they do not offer it a soul.

We are not fighting for conquest! We fear for the future! We are fighting for a revolution. For socialism. For the stars.

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!!

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!!!

1951, a calm sky stretches overhead, with large clouds drifting swiftly across the sunlit day above a military base. And, Autumn forest turns from green to yellow like a lime color. Around its perimeter, protesters begin to gather. The bunker door starts to seal shut, guarded firmly by the entire army standing its ground. In the air—tense peace.

The protesters wave old Glorsku flags and chant slogans from before the Communist coup. Some shout for freedom. Others cry for bread.

Suddenly, the gate explodes. The crowd surges forward. Protesters breach the base.

“They're anti-communist.”

“Like fascist or capitalist?”

“No. The resistance movement is crucial for keeping our nation united—not to ignite a civil war between Czechs and Slovaks, nor to stage some revolutionary overthrow. We need to stop waging wars with other nations. We should be learning from the mistakes of the Interwar period.”

“They will come down under a united cause. And no—killing in its name will only end in bloodshed…”

“General, you need help—tanks, planes, something.”

“No. We don’t need a counterrevolution on our soil. Wait—who am I talking to? How old are you?”

“I am General Prahasko of the socialist underground. And now, Major General of the Homeland Army. Same age as you, General[ Serebryakov](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=c7370d0d94b48ee2&cs=0&q=Viktoriya+Ivanovna+Serebryakov&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOMwVGI0_sWo65aZXJKZn5eYo-CckViUmFySWlSsoK8QnJieqJCfphCSmFeZqFCSkargWpaZ84uJI97VL8QzJDJ-AwvjKxZ-Ll79dH1DwxwTC8OyYksjhEi6QUlOinFFOkIkw7IoxSQpJw9JTVJaUblRrgWSGhMDi5LCqhSESFq2YXKOiWE5mq4sU3MkNeUZKfHpuWaoairNUyxRRIrNTY0MECJZpjlF5TnlSCZnlZSY52WblKHoyk1PTkpDNTk3yywZVaQoObsEyZw8kwKjDHNku9LSi4wMLJJQRQyTC7ORfJFTnJaWm2G6iFUuLDO7JL8oExjwnmWJeflleYkKwalFqUlFlYnZ-WW32CQZwvzCPydLaD4NbI6N_Wu8aeGltrjvCyZuZZvEIYItQidxiGGPUADzFjTbBgIAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiXj6yepumMAxXWQ_EDHXlkFHYQ7fAIegUIABDIAg).”

“I envy your title. Yet, I have a more important job than you.”

“What’s your post? Where do you operate?”

""Ask Boris, Head of the KGB. But understand this—if any civilian is killed on my bases, I’ll personally have him send *you* to Siberia. And if your men do such a thing under your command, I’ll kill you myself—by his own doctrine, as if I held the KGB chair. Protesters turned into rioters, echoing the Glorsku uprising—speaking again from the tense scenes of May 9th, 1954. But this isn’t May—it’s September 1st, 1955. This is for the government to resolve, not us. In May, it was the army’s task. September belongs to the politicians. But we are general, dummy.""

A few days in the future, “Tanya! We need you for the project. We’ll protect you—for the sake of your family’s future. I understand how much your family meant to you… how your mother’s birth was like the right hand of your core. You’re my aunt, Tanya. Not by blood alone, but by the oath of loyalty that binds us.”

“Erich Ivanov Serebryakov-Kozzacko... You are Rusyn, born of your mother’s homeland—the same homeland that gave me her loyalty with unwavering honor. If you carry her blood, then you carry the same flame I once thought had died with her.”

General Serebryakov-Kozzacko giving her favorite composer from relaxation being ready for her interview of her life in details, top secret information from her last life with non-favor light level of Rohypnol-Benzodiazepines plus high level of Ketamine beer for deep truth of her life. Then drinking drugged water with a light drink headed and slowed speech, generally showing the doctor to come here. “How long will its effects last?”

“It lasted around 11-26 hours for our interview and lasted 12-37 min, the beer effect would be stronger. She drank/ took this before?”

“Yes, I remember she experimented with my mother about drugs plus she was drinking at parties like hers and my mother’s birthday.”

12 minutes later, “I was a Japanese salaryman who was hit by a train by my canceling on man's future with a logical mindset. From my personality as cold-hearted, atheistic, and[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism)social- darwinism atheism by a past that I want to forget. Being X (aka, god of the world) that I am seeing as Ancients from Stargate but more similar to Ori actually because my words sound like false teachings of origins. Never mind that this information was from my timeline with all these events happening 5 years earlier. Not all this event happens now that never happened in my timeline. I learned from this war within my timeline, but it was 10 years earlier than this timeline. I am not a girl for fixing this timeline because I know this from my own past life...”

She keeps talking about it. 11 hours later: “OK. I understand this about your past life, I want to know about this lifetime.”

“Doctor, 11 hours have gone by. She needs to take more?”

“No, she doesn't need to but she has 14 hours more to go away. I need to take Morphine from this to be successful. You can sleep in this interview and I will take it for medical reasons.”

Author’s words: This will be a summary of the interview for the future plots, this information will show about other volumes for you as a reader. Her words are similar to talking to the camera within a Live TV Show like hell’s kitchen.

""My new life in the Empire is one marked by conflict, and from the very beginning, I demonstrate a pragmatic, military-minded intelligence. My military career begins with my rapid rise through the ranks due to my remarkable talent for combat magic and tactical warfare. Despite being physically a child, my mind is that of a seasoned adult, focused on survival and strategic success. I am particularly known for my calculated, ruthless approach to war, gaining me the nickname The Devil of the Rhine.""

""I am not simply a war machine—I am also a victim of Being X’s divine intervention. My primary personal goal becomes escaping the hold of the divine entity that placed me into this world, as I believe that I am being punished for my previous life’s atheism. Being X frequently appears to me as an elusive, god-like force, constantly interfering with my fate, leading to my internal struggle between my atheism and the undeniable existence of a higher power that controls my life.""

""My military tactics are brilliant, but they are also deeply pragmatic and often morally ambiguous. As an officer, I am deeply ruthless in my actions, using my magic and strategic intellect to crush my enemies without hesitation. I am quick to exploit weaknesses in my adversaries and, often, my subordinates as well. My cold pragmatism allows me to survive in a brutal, war-torn world where alliances are temporary, and lives are expendable.""

""My subordinates, such as the members of my elite unit—especially my loyal subordinate, Viktoriya Ivanovna Serebryakov—often find themselves caught between loyalty to me and the sheer terror of my cold, emotionless nature. My leadership style is often marked by my ability to outmaneuver my opponents tactically, exploiting weaknesses and leveraging the power of magic to ensure my dominance on the battlefield. My ascent through the military hierarchy is both a testament to my intelligence and my willingness to do whatever it takes to ensure my survival.""

""The central conflict of my life is my struggle against Being X, who not only controls my fate but also serves as the embodiment of divine providence. I, an atheistic character, loathe this entity and view it as the embodiment of everything I despise: an arbitrary higher power that imposes a predetermined fate upon me. In my previous life, I was a strong believer in self-determination and individual agency, rejecting any notion of divine intervention or guidance.""

""As I rise in military rank, Being X continues to intervene in my life in an attempt to guide me toward a religious awakening or to prove the existence of divine providence. This constant interference from Being X frustrates me, pushing me to confront a series of existential dilemmas. I become increasingly focused on finding a way to escape the divine’s influence, believing that my survival, success, and eventual escape from the god’s manipulation are the ultimate tests of my power and intelligence.""

""My antagonism toward Being X becomes a defining characteristic of my journey, and my attempts to find meaning in a world dominated by war, manipulation, and divine control are central to the storyline. This philosophical battle between my atheism and Being X’s divine machinations becomes one of the core themes of my existence.""

""My worldview is shaped by my experiences in the military. In this world, the Empire and its neighboring nations are embroiled in a brutal, unending war, with alliances shifting as quickly as military strategies. Magic is a powerful tool of warfare, and military leaders are expected to be both powerful mages and skilled tacticians. My leadership and magical abilities make me one of the Empire’s most feared officers, though I am also deeply aware of the human cost of warfare.""

""My pragmatic approach to the violence around me is rooted in the philosophy of survival and the will to power. I subscribe to a form of social Darwinism, believing that only the strong survive and that the weak must be discarded in the face of conflict. While I do not lack a sense of loyalty or responsibility to my comrades, my moral compass is twisted by the harsh realities of the world I inhabit, where survival often comes at the expense of others.""

""Despite my ruthless actions, there are moments where my humanity surfaces. I experience guilt, pain, and doubt, especially when confronted with the futility of the wars I fight or the personal losses I endure. These moments of vulnerability complicate my otherwise cold and calculating persona, highlighting the internal conflict that defines much of my character.""

""My ultimate goal is to escape the clutches of Being X and, in doing so, free myself from the divine interference in my life. Throughout my journey, I am consistently trying to outsmart the divine, using my intellect, military genius, and magic to out-maneuver Being X’s plans. This goal defines much of my character arc and drives my actions in both military engagements and personal decisions.""

""My relationship with my subordinates evolves as well. While I initially treat them as mere tools in my ascent through the ranks, I come to recognize their value and loyalty. My bond with them, particularly with Viktoriya and my other subordinates, is complex—I am both their leader and a person they look to for guidance, but at the same time, my methods often challenge their moral boundaries.""

""As my power grows, so too does the reach of Being X’s influence. The military conflicts I engage in become more complex and catastrophic, and my tactics are both admired and feared by all who witness them. However, as I approach the peak of my military career, my existential struggle with Being X comes to a head. I am faced with a final confrontation that will determine whether I can free myself from the divine's influence and prove that I can control my own fate.""

""The overarching plot of my life touches upon themes of free will versus divine fate, the morality of warfare, the corrupting nature of power, and the philosophical battle between belief and atheism. Throughout my journey, my character evolves from a purely pragmatic military leader to a person grappling with questions of identity, faith, and personal redemption.""

14 hours later: “Erich, what happened in this interview.”

“This interview was 26 hours long, while you had these questions, that you black out. While answering all questions is similar to driving blindness, aunt said that we need to sleep because we need water from too much alcohol that we had without knowing about it. The doctor told me to go on for our interview by pushing sub-conscious.”

Next day, “Aunt , drugging you for my knowledge of you. I know, my mother had this information for you, please don’t be pissed.”

“Erich, I don't do that much. I became friends with Being X, he told me in my dream. It is a secret from everything, I need to think about being X is actually my father from my past life. I can tell you and others about it, resetting them is the mother's secret to the whole family. I need to keep until I die like a full reset like a breaker, you know me more deeper then your mother for my sake.”

**Tanya von Degurechaf Courtroom From A Year Ago:**

A long, dark corridor lit by flickering sodium lamps. The air is damp with mildew and memory. Boots echo across concrete like distant gunfire. Tanya von Degurechaff enters, her posture soldier-straight, but her eyes… hollow. She wears a plain olive-gray coat, stripped of medals and insignia—like a ghost dressed in the shadow of her former self. Faces watch from both sides— soldiers, partisans, tribunal staff. Some in awe. Others in disgust. One old woman spits. At the front sits the panel: A Glorsku general, a Soviet commissar, a Jewish survivor in a modest shawl, and an American observer with a tape recorder. But the central voice is General Prahasko, the scar-faced veteran known for breaking war criminals with only questions.

“Tanya von Degurechaff. Former Commander, Imperial Mage Division. Known aliases: The Devil of the Rhine. Annihilation Angel. Secondhand Godchild. Accused of 21,500 confirmed civilian killings in the First War; indirect responsibility for around 80 million deportations and 4,356 extermination campaigns during the Second. Further accusations: psychological manipulation of child soldiers, deployment of unauthorized weapons upon surrendering forces, and—”

“Stop. Stop now!!! I can hear it any more being I am saying please, forgive me please.”

She picks up a charred photograph from the mountain of documents. A burned village. A dying child’s eyes stare straight at her—captured forever. With her tears like depressed person going do suicide.

“I... remember this one. That day... It was raining ash... I ordered it. I am like Hitler and Stalin in one person but I am the deadliest leader in the world. Fuck me, I was so evil more then worst one in my earth’s history.”

No denial. No apology. No attempt to shift blame. Just a broken soul standing naked before truth. Tanya pulls the files toward her—hands trembling, eyes hollow. And she begins to read aloud, each name, each location, each act. A ritual. A funeral. A courtroom exorcism. Tears stream silently. Each page a bullet into her own mythology.

“The Party has decided not to execute you. Instead—your name, your rank, your identity... will be erased. For the crimes of Tanya von Degurechaff, there will be no legacy. Only shame.”

She slowly removes her overcoat and places it on the cold stone floor. A final act of surrender.

“Then let her die here. With Suicidal mindset. Ashes of the Homeland for a new revolution is not just the overthrow of systems, but the honest facing of memory, guilt, and soul.”

She picks up the new registry document, signs it: Tanya walks alone through white ash and snow, her breath visible. Old barracks collapse in the wind behind her like memories crumbling. Children laugh in the distance, their voices bright but far. She stops. Watches. One tear rolls down her cheek—not for herself, but for the life she burned.

“Why, being X...? Why give me this life again? Perhaps… one soul can still be rebuilt.”

She looks to the pale winter sky. That stopped her depressive mindset and by wanting to start a new life of peace.

**Tanya’s Dream:**

In the heart of a fractured world, where memory and time collide in fractured symphonies, Tanya finds herself on an endless train, racing through endless landscapes of history’s ghosts—wars, revolutions, empires rising and falling in moments, scattered and lost. She sits there, staring out the window, seeing not the road ahead but the smoldering ruins of places she's never been, yet somehow knows deeply, intimately. The train doesn’t stop, but the scenery shifts, constantly changing from one chapter of her life to the next—flashes of victories long forgotten, failures she can't remember, and desires that were never her own. It all merges, a kaleidoscope of past and future worlds, and Tanya is a spectator, but also the director.

Her feet don’t feel the train beneath her—they feel the endless weight of the generations she carries on her shoulders. She tries to step off, but the floor beneath her dissolves, and she is transported into a courtroom, or perhaps a battlefield dressed as a courtroom. A figure sits at the front—her own face, twisted in judgment. She is both accused and accuser, and the crime is too vast to name. She opens her mouth to speak, to explain, to protest, but all that escapes her lips are screams—dissonant, tangled in a reel of static and memories too painful to untangle. The jury is made of faces she recognizes but can't place—those she has loved, and those she has betrayed. They do not speak. No one speaks. The verdict is not theirs to give. Time itself stands still, a frozen weight pressing on her chest.

She’s thrust from this space, as if pulled by invisible hands, and suddenly, she is in an office—an office she never worked in, yet somehow, it’s hers. Papers cover the desk, blank, unreadable, like the future before her. The walls, devoid of pictures, are shifting, constantly rearranging themselves. The air hums with the sound of decisions she hasn’t made, lives she hasn’t lived, promises broken before they could be kept. In the corner of the room stands Viktoriya, a quiet figure, still, hands holding a cup of coffee that never cools. She stares at Tanya with eyes that hold both sympathy and reproach, asking softly, almost as if she already knows the answer: “Will you start over?”

Tanya opens her mouth, but before she can respond, the world itself bends around her. The walls crack, splintering into fragments that rain down like snowflakes, falling into an abyss of water. She doesn’t drown, but she sinks—deeper, deeper, into a cold, silent ocean of her own making. Down below, she sees something. A figure, small, fragile, yet unbroken, stands on the ocean floor. It is herself, only younger—barefoot, untarnished by the wars she fought, unscarred by the lessons she learned too late. This younger version of Tanya looks at her with soft eyes, not full of judgment or pity, but a quiet, painful understanding. The child speaks in a voice that isn’t really a voice, but a pull at her heart: “Remember... and choose.”

And then everything stops. The water stills, the office vanishes, the train ceases its endless motion. Tanya wakes—but she is not where she was. She is not who she was. She is something *new*, something *other*, yet still herself in ways she cannot yet understand. The train, the endless ride, is still there, but now, it no longer holds her captive. She is not rushing to somewhere she must be, nor is she chasing something that no longer matters. She sits, still, and looks out at the passing world with eyes that have finally seen it for what it truly is—fragile, broken, yet beautiful. And for the first time in ages, she doesn't feel the weight of history bearing down on her, nor the responsibility of wars not her own. She feels free.

In this final moment of clarity, she understands that the dream is not hers to conclude. It holds no end, no final destination. It is simply a journey—an endless series of steps she must choose to take, day by day, moment by moment, unburdened by a past that doesn’t belong to her, or a future she cannot control. In the space between what is and what could be, she chooses—not to flee, but to live, to forgive, to remember. To start anew. Even as empires fall and new banners rise, even as Tanya von Degurechaff becomes Tanya Gurečafska, no new name can erase the past. No revolution can erase the memories of the soul. I know I am broken inside, but I will heal from this.

**Her Bedroom:**

Tanya awakens, drenched in cold sweat, her hands trembling as the remnants of her dream linger in the stillness of the room. The nightmare, a shattered mosaic of past and future, leaves her shaken, as though she's been dragged across time itself by forces she cannot name or escape. The weight of her past decisions presses heavily on her chest, suffocating, relentless. She stands there, facing the mirror in her quiet bedroom, staring at her reflection. The woman in the glass is no longer just Tanya von Degurechaff; she is a soul fractured by endless wars, hollow victories, and a future that stretches out, as boundless and empty as the train she was trapped on in her dream.

In this moment of painful clarity, she feels something unfamiliar stir within her—a voice, perhaps her own, perhaps something more, urging her to remember. To choose. To start anew. The young girl she saw beneath the ocean’s depths, untouched by the world’s burdens, gazes at her with quiet understanding. ""Remember... and choose."" A pull at her heart, as though this decision is the key to breaking free from the never-ending cycle of destruction.

Tanya’s gaze shifts from the mirror, where her reflection begins to morph into the figure of her past life as a Japanese salaryman—silent, composed, holding a cup of coffee. Her presence is both soothing and accusatory. ""Will you start over?"" The question lingers in the air, an undeniable challenge. For a brief moment, Tanya freezes, not from fear, but from the weight of what such a choice means. The walls around her crack, shattering like the illusions she has carefully constructed. She sinks—not into despair, but into something deeper, something unspoken, a quiet catharsis.

Tears fall—unexpected, soft, but necessary. For the first time, she does not flee. She does not run from the past, nor from the future. She simply chooses—to live, to forgive, to remember. Not to escape, but to begin again, as if every moment, every decision, is hers to shape. And in that fragile, fleeting moment of clarity, Tanya feels free—free from the past, free from the train, free from the wars that once defined her existence. She is still herself, but a new version. The journey is far from over, and perhaps it never will be, but now, she is no longer a prisoner. She is the one who will choose the next step, even in the face of all that still needs healing.

*Erich didn’t approach me seeking mercy; he approached out of necessity. The world they lived in—fragile, shattered—was on the edge of another catastrophe. New powers were rising from the wreckage of old wars, much like my own world in the 20th century. They needed my tactical brilliance, her understanding of war on a scale no other soul could comprehend.*

""I believed in logic alone. In this life, I believed only in survival. In the next… perhaps I will learn to believe in souls. The higher I rise, the deeper the scars I leave, both on the world and on myself.""

*I eventually come to realize that no victory, no accumulation of power, no clever evasion of Being X’s plans can erase the weight of what I’ve done. The blood of the Rhine, the ashes of the villages, the broken gazes of children—they never wash away, no matter how far I run, or how high I climb.*

But looking back, it was simple—nothing like today’s chaos with social media.

Though the defendant is deceased, the state proceeds with posthumous hearings at the family's request. His murder is name Hiyuchi Mansararu, killed him by impulsive outrage.”

|| || |**Father’s Suicide Letter:** **Dear My Lovely Wife:** If you are reading this, it means I could no longer carry the weight. I’m sorry—I’m so deeply sorry for the pain this may cause you, though I fear my absence will only echo the emptiness that has already begun to take root. Our son is gone. I can’t believe I’m writing those words. I can’t breathe knowing they are true. The light of my life, the boy I held in my arms, taught to walk, taught to speak, and dreamed with—he's gone. And no reason, no explanation, no justice can ever make that right. I tried to be strong for you. For him. But the silence left in his absence is louder than any scream. And when the truth arrived—too late, too sharp—it broke something in me that cannot be repaired. He died, and the world kept turning like nothing had happened. That’s the part I can't live with. What kind of father am I if I can’t protect my son? What kind of man survives while his child is buried beneath questions and grief? Please forgive me. This is not your fault. It’s not even mine alone. It is the fault of a world that waited too long, and a justice system that counts days while we count pieces of our hearts. I cannot endure this timeline any longer. I am coming for him like helping in my next life. Forever yours, Your Beloved Husband| || || ||

**Chapter Two: Journey Begins**

We come back to this reality, a term called SP-01 coming out from some desert that they thought of as Sahara. “Wow, it is successful. Later I thought, GG-01 and GG-02 need to ride on Pionir with me opposite the way of sunset because you know from geology. You need to learn Francois because you know our enemy language (from our occupation by Nazis) for your own good, GG-03 and GG-04 staying next to the portal for sending messages to we made it plus protecting the gateway. Let’s go, we need to come back to our base for making plans then giving it to our government not only saving our comrades.”

A few days later, “where is the other side of the port city called Nouadhibou and New Nouad- hibou is a town that gives a faster path for us by ferry, not ships like in that city.”

“Hey, you sound like autistic. You've been in here before?” Everyone is laughing while the truck is shaking like an earthquake.

“Of course, it was my visit to Henri Joseph Goumenri. He is like us for socialism and anti-imperial, I love his work like Erich will talk about because I want to know you more than you know me like you are doing now. Well we still need to go to New Nouadhibou, you need to go for other topics. Sorry, for that our discussion from my past. Similar question about Greece, like you talked about a girl that you have a crush on?”

“No, no. She isn’t like that for me,” why’ll blush at the same time.

“You know you are cute, when you are blushing. Look at Horizon, New Nouadhibou is close. We will be around an hour, that good that we are not living in the Firefly universe. New Nouadhibou is his hometown, he has few kids that you like spending time with. Someone is attacking the town and city, Nazi pirates. No, it is not them. Resistance freighter, you need to be ready to fight like in Stalingrad. We can fly well because I was banned from flying, they have it. Fuck, I’ll be using it from them. Now, go faster.”

They are shocked about Resistance frights coming from flying overhead on a beetle, “they don’t have armor like they have stolen the tech. We need to fight with French forces for our safety, you need to say to them that we are Glorsku army in exile.”

“Pirate Raid Sirens combined all of Hörmann and Siemens sirens into ones called Sirènes d'occupation system and Siemens one is louder for telling what it is air for example, he is training your skills against resistance like under our nation will have.” They are riding to the town with a non-propaganda song to hide their identity, “Goumenri don’t know about our identity. He will understand about it, better to change the topic about how we are opposites for our own good.”

An hour later, the town is in ruin from the pirate's defensive raid system screaming out like a crying baby from top of the lungs while going into the city. People doing their things then people are punching, they are running into shelters like cattle herds going into processing facilities from the deadliest shot called bunker busters bullet. “Turyści odchodzą od ogona i budynku, do magazynu, a ty możesz popatrzeć na prasę.” - Their misunderstanding from a Pospolita tour guide into their language. “Turisté jdou na chvostu budovám, ke skladování a mohou být staré u tisku.”- what the tour guide actually said.

Children are playing around with their bikes and scooters within bomb craters, “going to the shelter and meeting up with their parents… What up, my old friend and come to bomb shelter with me. I like to talk about our life going on, I heard an Empire dictator looks similar to you.”

“Hey, Tanya! How are you, my old friend.”

“This is Goumenri?” 

“Yes, he is. He will help with our issues, if you ask anything that he will do.”

“I will fight for your city because we are the Free Glorsku Corps of the International Occup- ational Army. I know you need time with Tanya for old pals to do.” 

“Do you know that the Cold War is between National Liberal and Social Liberal from outcry from National Socialism (White Army and Weimarium), I predict the West will be an unholy social liberal like in 1930s-40s.”

“Did you hear about Nazical Watch Trials from members of the Imperiale Weibliche Völkisch Prinzip Ordnungs Partei (Imperial People of Girlhood Order Principle Party)? That truth about your prediction with my own will be like your mindset, the pact of nations will be going opposite paths like we are seeing now in our modern world that people are aware of it. I will teach you about the power of wisdom from scientific magic, I was the master of your general and Tanya came to me to relearn wisdom from god but she didn’t learn from him.”

“O Arabisch Kossacki w pospolity noci a nich, poza Łado senu: O arabských Kozákoch v pospolity noci a ich útoku, póza Lado nespal. Dwaji Dwaji, Ludzisk Pospolitacy od Rzeczpospolita: Dvaji dvaji, obyčejní lidé z Rzeczpospolita.”

They all going into shelter but they don’t know those tourist are spies of Peoples Rzeczpospolita, Rzeczpospolian can speaking Rusynian language put within Sokolia/ Góralska/ Rzeczpos- polita for international language is dialectics per language (this is like paradox from coming from dying language, they don’t know it is there god is dead but other god took over dying world like “The Boy and The Horn” can be called beauty of death by giving alway to other generation).

Top Secret discussion for you, you need to give me — a card for the classified document but you are spying on them under gods eye. If you are an angel that you can go for free, if not you can’t know our secret from Top Earth’s Secret (from your freedom to create dialog).

Kids are playing an artifact that looks like Pokémon ball, “Hey Kids. What type of toy do you have?” The kids that Tanya is talking to, he is confused and afraid that you were a kid that you felt defensive to your toy that you think some will take away from you. “It looks like an artifact not a toy, it looks like a pokémon ball. Where did you find that? I don’t mind you keeping it because finder keepers, I need to take over that pokémon ball factory.”

“What is a Pokémon ball? Pokémon ball, a toy or something else like a grenade?""

“Hey Kid, throw it in the corner with your mother standing next to you to protect you from us.” Then that kid throws the pokémon ball, there is a type of Pokémon.

“Wait. what? That is a Gadmeer or Mewtwo! Mewtwo (from Pokémon) made Gadmeer (Stargate) into their civilizational empire/-s, Mewtwo escaped into Stargate’s Universe by Quantum Window becoming Gadmeer from finding a time machine in their views?”

“Hello, my race is Gadmeer Beta Alius from the pokémon genus called Mewtwo.”

“Ok, you proved my theory about Pokémon's Universe Quantum Windowed Stargate.”

“I want to be your Pokémon because you know my kind and stargate so why’ll.”

“In this reality that we have music and gate guns, Stargate is called Starportal in this reality. I will call you from Taban-bę (Nepanese language of datebase), do you love that? Pokémon can’t exist in this world, what is your main culture?” Nepan is Japan in this reality not Nepal, XP.

“I don’t mind, it may fit you more than my own title. My race is that we are using a Pokémon ball coming from Mewtwo world as an original world like Pokémon ball factories in abandoned islands, it was nuked around a few nuclear bombs per island.” The Pokémon world looks like a type of utopia that comes from the eyes of a kid but the reality is darker or even darker then our timeline/ world like his pre-isekaizian Earth history, “I want to say something and ask a ques- tion. What is your name? How is the quantum window different from the quantum mirror?”

“My name is only cats and pokémon understands, humans need to name us like pets and that is shameful. I want to see your most popular cities and landmarks on Earth, like you have in Roo- sevelt Island Civic Center, New York, New Yorkshire, New England?”

“Yes, we expect that it isn't called New York, New Yorkshire but Yankeeham, Yankeeshire in Angloland and we have Roosevelt-Randall-Ricker-Governor Island Civic Center for the SEM-P system like other nations have there to better control over the nation with Dingecommunism/ Resgemeinsamism from Rzeczpospolitism within Rzeszpospolitism. Kościuszko become frist president of Angloland and he pushed Resgemeinsamism is nationalist with his moment are socialist scheme that they pushing for Dingecommunism, Angloland Civil War had two main problem is Slavery from greedic elites from the Southern part of Angloland but North don’t want it anymore plus Angloland Eastern-Western divided was made people wanting to for Empire are Resgemeinsamism (Polish Philosopher want to make Poland into being like Roman Empire from the word called Rzeszpospolitism) against it could called Dingecommunism (Polish Philosopher want to make Poland into become like family from the word called Rzeczpospolitism).""",1,1753295055.0,Starportalia,1,1.0,False

A small ""treat"" here, a late night online order there. It didn’t feel like a big deal, but over time it added up  wasted money, clutter, and guilt. I finally started asking *why* I buy things I don’t need. What I found was that most of my spending came from emotions  stress, boredom, or even happiness.

Here are 5 simple habits that helped me stop:

**1. The 24-hour (or 30-day) rule:**  
Now, I add things I want to a list - not my cart. I wait at least 24 hours for small things, 30 days for big ones. Most of the time, I don’t even want it anymore.

**2. Spot the emotional triggers:**  
I realized I shop when I’m overwhelmed. Instead of browsing apps, I try to walk, write, or call a friend. That pause helps a lot.

**3. Track everything:**  
I started logging *every* expense in a free app. Coffee, snacks, tiny Amazon buys — it was eye-opening. It made me face the truth and fix leaks.

**4. Use cash for problem areas:**  
If I tend to overspend on takeout, I give myself a set amount in cash. When it’s gone, that’s it. It makes each decision feel more real.

**5. Ask 3 quick questions before buying:**

* Do I *really* need this?
* Does it fit my goals?
* Can I afford it without hurting my savings?

This small pause changed everything. It turned off autopilot mode.

Since doing this, I've saved more, felt less guilty, and even enjoyed the things I *do* buy more. I’m still working on it  but these steps helped me break out of the spend-regret-repeat loop.

Do you have other tricks that help stop impulse spending?

The waitress smiles with her baby blue eyes and blonde hair. Everything reminds me of her.

“Your usual spot, Ben?” she asks. 

“Please.”

Tucked away in the corner of a small countryside diner, a booth with the perfect view of a small patch of pine trees. It’s her favorite spot.

I sit. The wood from the booth shifts and creaks of age.

“Would you like anything to drink while you wait?” 

“A coffee and an orange juice.”

“Alright, anything else?” 

I shake my head. She sets the two drinks in front of me.

Coffee is bold and bitter. Orange juice is tart and sweet. Together, it’s a perfect pair, their smooth poignant aroma floats in the air—bitterness and brightness side by side.

The sun beams through the window illuminating the steam from the coffee. It's a warm embrace like her winter sweater against my skin. 

Summer is her favorite. Winter is mine. She loves the scent of fresh flowers blooming in the open fields. All I see is the pesky mosquitoes nagging at my legs. 

We are different. Some people would say we are too different, but I say we are perfect in our differences. 

The Bluebirds flutter in the trees as they did that morning. Their beautiful blue wings shine as bright as the soft glow of her eyes. 

They puff out their golden brown chests as they sing into the morning sky. Brown and blue. Two different colors coming together to make the bluebird. 

I hated them once. Now, I watch them each morning, hoping they’ll carry something back. 

I reach for my black bag by my feet. The soft wooden frame brushes against my hand. 
I lift it and place it so her smile meets me again. 

“Happy birthday, my love,” I say, my voice cracking as I hold back the tears. I try to match her unwavering glow. The bright blue to my brown. The sweet to my bitter. The warm to my cold.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a walker tray hinges on several critical features that impact its usability and effectiveness. Understanding these specifications is crucial for choosing a tray that aligns with your individual needs and preferences.**Size and Dimensions**

The size of the tray directly affects its ability to hold items securely. Larger trays offer more surface area, accommodating full meals or multiple objects, while smaller trays may be more maneuverable in tight spaces.Consider the dimensions of the tray in relation to the width of your walker and the typical items you plan to carry.

**Material and Durability**

The material used in the tray's construction determines its durability and ease of cleaning. Common materials include durable plastics, lightweight aluminum, or a combination of both. Evaluate the material's resistance to scratches,stains,and impacts to ensure it can withstand daily use.

**Weight Capacity**

Each tray has a specific weight capacity, indicating the maximum load it can safely support. Exceeding this limit can compromise the tray's stability and possibly lead to accidents. Review the weight capacity and ensure it's sufficient for the items you intend to carry, accounting for the weight of plates, cups, and other accessories.

**Attachment Mechanism**

Some trays may require tools for installation, while others offer tool-free setups.

**Edge Design and Spill Prevention**

The presence of raised edges or spill-resistant features can significantly minimize the risk of spills and accidents.

Consider this feature if you frequently carry beverages or other potentially spillable items.

**Compatibility with Walker Types**

Ensure the tray is compatible with the specific type of walker you own. Walkers vary in size, shape, and construction, and not all trays are universally compatible.

I’m from Kalyan Nagar, Bangalore, and lately I’ve been trying to break out of my usual bubble and be more social — especially with women, not in a creepy way, but just because I wanna grow, connect better, and see where good conversations go.

Not looking for a meetup or party invite. More like casual chats, voice notes, or a walk with good coffee and chaotic life theories. Music, memes, ADHD, late-night overthinking? I’m in.

If you’re someone who vibes with that — guy or girl — drop a message. No expectations. Just real convos and fresh energy.",1,1753294692.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

Jasmine and I were classmates in grad school, however, I recently decided I did not want to pursue my degree anymore, so I left. I was moving out, and had to get rid of a small coffee table, dining table, and 2 chairs, which I was planning to sell for $100. I was originally planning to post an ad for it in our class group chat. I also told Jasmine, and she offered to buy it for $70, to which I agreed (I needed it gone fast). The next day, she offered to pay for my brunch, which was $20, in a way to pay back for the furniture. (She's the only person I've met who paid me back in food/stuff. This has never fucking been the case with ANY of my friends). This happened in mid-May.

I live 6 hours away from this grad school, and weeks later, Jasmine and her bf invited me to attend a trading card convention with them. I agreed, as I've never been to one before. I knew there was an entry fee to pay. Jasmine talked to me over the phone, and said that she would take care of the $35 entry fee and I would not need to pay her back; she just wanted to see me. I drive to their city, where they host me in their apartment. She took us 3 out for dinner. When it was time to pay for the food, she said that she would pay for everyone (around $80) and I wouldn't have to worry about paying her back (around $25). The next day, we go to the convention. I paid for what I wanted, except at this one table, there was a vendor that didn't except credit card, only cash/Venmo. Jasmine gave some money to Andrew to pay $25 for my gaming cards, and I said I'd buy them food.

At lunch, I brought up paying them back for the cards. I told her she still owed me money for the furniture ($50 now), and asked if the cost of the furniture could cover the cards. She agreed. Andrew then made a remark that he thought that I gave the furniture for FREE out of the kindness of my heart. Jasmine told him then that she had agreed to buy the furniture for $70. Then she went back on her word and said that the cost of the convention entry fee would be covered by the furniture fee. I was so upset hearing this. I didn't want to ruin the moment, so I kept quiet.

Later, we decide to get ice cream, which totaled to around $50, and I paid for the 3 of us share. I paid $28 for their ice creams, which, to my understanding, would be reimbursed by Jasmine. We then got Korean BBQ, which was honestly expensive. Going into this, 1) I didn't know where we were going (there were several places) and 2) I didn't know it would be expensive for 1 meal. Jasmine and Andrew chose their favorite place and we ate there. Jasmine paid around $115 for the three of us, (which included $30 for my meal). She said I could reimburse her back via food/service/items.

This is bothering me for weeks now; she STILL owes me money. I want to text her and ask for my roughly $22 back.
