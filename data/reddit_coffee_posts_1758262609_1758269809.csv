I'm writing this from a place I never thought I'd be: 35 pounds lighter and finally feeling in control of my body. For years, I was stuck in the brutal cycle of ""eat clean all day, binge on sugar at night."" My willpower was no match for my crashing energy levels and insane sugar cravings. I was tired, frustrated, and my metabolism felt like it was permanently broken.

I knew about CICO. I knew I needed to move more. But my hunger hormones and lack of energy were saboteurs I couldn't defeat with willpower alone.

Then, I stumbled upon¬†**Nagano Tonic**. I was, of course, skeptical. But the ingredient list stopped me. It wasn't a mysterious blend; it was things like¬†**Matcha, Momordica Charantia (Bitter Melon), Chromium, and powerful Polyphenols**. These are known for supporting metabolism and, crucially,¬†**balancing blood sugar levels**. The science made sense to me. Stable blood sugar = fewer cravings = sustainable weight loss. So, I took a chance.

**Here‚Äôs my honest experience:**

* **The First Week:**¬†I started drinking it every morning. The taste is actually pleasant ‚Äì a berry-like flavor that mixes easily with water. The biggest shock was the¬†**energy boost**. No jitters, no crash. Just... steady, natural energy. For the first time in years, I didn't need a 3 PM coffee to survive. This alone was a game-changer.
* **By Week 3: The Cravings VANISHED.**¬†This was the real miracle. Walking past the office donuts was... easy. I didn't have to white-knuckle my way through the evening. The tonic genuinely curbed my appetite and silenced the constant mental chatter about food. It gave my willpower a fighting chance.
* **The Results (3 Months In):**¬†With this new-found control, I could finally stick to a moderate diet and enjoy my daily walks. The weight started melting off consistently. I've lost¬†**35 lbs**¬†to date. But the Non-Scale Victories (NSVs) are even better:
   * No more afternoon energy crashes.
   * Mental clarity and focus are through the roof.
   * My relationship with food is healed. I no longer see it as the enemy.

**Is it a Magic Pill? Absolutely not.**¬†You still have to put in the work. But what Nagano Tonic did was¬†**remove the biggest barriers**¬†that made the work feel impossible. It fixed my broken hunger signals and gave me the energy to actually live my life.

If your struggle sounds like my old struggle‚Äîespecially with sugar addiction and low energy‚ÄîI can't recommend trying this enough. It was the key that unlocked everything for me.

**EDIT:**¬†A few of you have DM'd me asking for the link to avoid fakes. I originally got mine on the¬†**official website here:** .[https://85436ms4zooxcm9amis9u1dzcr.hop.clickbank.net](https://85436ms4zooxcm9amis9u1dzcr.hop.clickbank.net/). They have a discount bundle and a money-back guarantee, which made me feel safe trying it. I'd avoid Amazon/eBay for this, as there are a lot of duplicates.

1nkxpup,https://www.reddit.com/r/soup/comments/1nkxpup/campbells_has_lost_the_plot/,Campbell's has lost the plot,"I am s soup whore (can I say that?). My husband likes soup but not as much as I do (I'm working on him!), so I eat condensed/canned/ramen packages for snacks, breakfast, pick me up, quick meal, etc. 

Since High School I would regularly eat soup for breakfast with toast or crackers and tea (now as an adult it's often coffee). 

My go to soups for this were mostly Campbell's Cream of Asparagus and Campbell's Chicken Vegetable. The CoA was also good for quick throw together recipes. I'd also eat Lipton Noodle Soups, Nile Spice Couscous Parmesan (still miss it immensely). 

Anyway, Campbell's just recently discontinued Cream of Asparagus and Chicken Vegetable after over 60 years (!!!). I don't know what they are thinking but there are more cheese soups and now spicy Chicken Noodle (I can just add hot sauce, guys).

I already messaged Campbell's and got the ""yes, they're discontinued, we sent coupons, we listen, blah blah...'

Any suggestions on substitutes, or do you know of any similar? Apparently a British brand, Batchelor (which has ties to Campbell's) has a Cream of Asparagus, but I only found it one place online and it was crazy expensive; don't want to spend a lot and not like it.

Anyone have suggestions for mass produced soups they like in the same vein? 

I made a really good Creamy Asparagus soup, but having something canned and on hand makes it easy to scratch the itch or use it in cooking, as I said.

1nkxphq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nkxphq/forgot_to_take_out_trash_mom_got_mad_and/,"Forgot to take out trash, mom got mad and physically hurt me","Hi everyone, I (17F) made a post a few months ago about my family situation, but just a few minutes ago something else happened. (This is a long read im very sorry). Im also very sorry if thats the wrong flair to use for this post, but it also deals with both suicide and violence, so I'll unsure what flare to use. Anyways here's the story:

So for me it was the first week of school this week (started on the 15th) and today is a holiday for my school, so today I was sleeping in a bit and got up to use the bathroom and my mom (48F) asked me if I could make her a coffee and I said I could but first I would use the bathroom. Also just to be more specific im also on my period, which for me means if I have to go number 2, it hurts and takes a while to get It out. So I was in the bathroom doing my thing, and my mom suddenly says: ""what trash is today?"" And im like: ""trash? It's trash day today?"" And then I realized the black trash hadn't been put outside and I wasnt exactly dressed and was still on the toilet.

 So my mom starts yelling at me to run it outside and I try explaining to her ""I can't, im not dressed and im also on the toilet!"". Eventually like 2 min later shes coming downstairs and yelling at me and opens the bathroom door, and the only thing I really have on is my underwear and a blanket I have draped over myself because it as cold. So im now actively getting up off of the toilet and wipe n stuff, then she starts pushing me and stuff, and I say to her im sorry for forgetting, and the next thing I know she kicks me in my private parts and calls me mean names. At this point im holding back tears and I push her out of my way so I can get out of the bathroom and I tell her ""what the fuck is wrong with you? I understand i forgot to take out the trash but that doesnt mean you should be treating me like this!"" And she starts yelling at me more. In times like this is I kind of emotionally shut down and just look at her blankly. 

And my mom starts talking about my little sister (11F) and starts comparing her to me. How she is always smiling and im not, how she takes care of her hair and i dont, how she takes care of her skin and i dont, how she wakes herself up in the morning (i have been doing that myself for years, idk where she was going with that) and how she is generally a good person and im not. 

I have been struggling with myself for years, this year has been especially bad and ive considered suicide multiple times a day at this point, and before anyone asks, no im not diagnosed with anything so I can't exactly say for sure im depressed or something. But point is im constantly really close to just ending it and her saying all of thise things is a reminder that i am not good enough for anything. She also said im almost 18 and still cant even regularly take out the trash, i dont do skincare or haircare properly and am just a wreck and in her words i ""suck"". So now im crying up in my room and my mom has called me ""slut"" and a ""whore"" from downstairs and is saying i should move out and take my life into my own hands. I also have a class trip planned next week, since this year I dont know any of my classmates my teacher made it possible for us to go on a ""get to know each other"" field trip for 3 days, and my mom said I am no longer allowed to go and she wants her money back that she payed willingly for the trip. I told her back then its fine if I don't go but she insisted. 

I also feel like mentioning this, but im a lesbian and my whole life my mom has been extremely homophobic, when i was in 5th grade (im in 11th now) my mom asked me what boy I have a crush on and is said I had one on a girl, and she took me home and slapped me across the face and told me thats digusting, and that caused me to have a sort of internalized homophobia for the rest of my life, and I will admit this next part is really stupid but I bought myself a dildo a few months ago, thinking ""maybe if I use this, it will fix me and my mom will love me"". Long story short my brother was going through my closet trying to find my mom's phones (he was banned from being on them cause he misbehaved) and he found it and proceeded to tell my mom and she got super mad at me. I finally told her why I had that and surprisingly she said she'd love me no matter what and even promised me the next day me and her could go out to eat and talk about it. That never happened cause we ended up bringing my siblings with us and then we couldnt talk about it. And now when we get into arguments she says homophobic and hurtful things towards me. One time she even said she was afraid I would ""look at her and my sister that way"". What? What the fuck? My mom has also said to me while I was having a breakdown that ""all lesbians have a screw loose"" and that made it worse.

So just generally I have a really poor self image and self worth. Im posting this here because I think I need comfort at the moment. I had a mental breakdown earlier and honestly have been for a few months now altogether. I feel like absolute shit right now and dont know what to do with myself. I feel very pathetic. I dont know what the point of me being on this earth is anymore, I am a completely failure of a person. I dont know who I am anymore. And I literally have become so dumb to everything these days. Maybe someone has advice of what I should do? What should I say to my mom? I feel bad for yelling and pushing her. I could keep going talking about how i feel but I think this post is already long enough and I might post about that somewhere else.

My lovely friends came over for a week because I live just beside one of the most beautiful capitals in the world. 

The first 4 days were great however, we're on day 5 and I just can't wait for them to leave. 

They have been very sweet and invited me to dinner and out for my birthday so it's not like they are ungrateful beasts or unkind in any way. 

I just feel like I need to be constantly cleaning after them because they do not value tidiness as much as I do. I've been basically cooking 2-3 meals a day, which involves a lot of cleaning. 

There is also the fact that although I've shown them every part of my house and appliances, they still request assistance for things such as making a coffee and don't really help out when it comes to cleaning anything up or even putting their mugs in the dishwasher. 


I also feel a bit socially burnt out and I keep suggesting activities they could on their own but they really insist on spending time with me. 
 
I think this may be amplified because I have been going through something very difficult and I'm not exactly in full-blown relaxation mode either, so I'm most likely at fault here.

Sometimes they just ask that with no other info and sometimes they'll add something like ""I'm trying to come up with a design that encapsulates my love for photography, paris, and coffee"" or whatever. 

One, same with any other requests for ideas on any other subreddit, but it feels incredibly lazy and impersonal to ask people to come up with something for you. Do you not care enough to do so yourself?

Two, I'm bothered by the concept of the type of person who WOULD be satisfied with an idea a random stranger gives them enough to go get it permanently tattooed on them. 

Three, a lot of the requests that give you a few prompts about their personal interests seem to think that someone's going to be able to come up with an idea that magically encapsulates their entire personality in one design. That's almost an impossible ask unless you're as one-dimensional as one can get, but NOBODY is that simple. 

This is not aimed at people who provide sufficient detail and present actual ideas of their own, by the way. Purely the ones who express no ideas and/or a handful of extremely basic prompts. There's a big difference between someone who expects you to do the thinking for them and someone who actually brings concepts to the table.

""Josie, you know you screwed up, right?"" Vincent Oldham's voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog.

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar.

'Wait, didn't I die?' she thought.

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she'd hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to escape the depression.

'So why am I staring at Vincent, my old college buddy?' Josie blinked hard, her eyes burning. 'Am I tripping again?

'Imagining my crew's here to spring me from jail?'

""Look, we get it‚Äîyou're gunning to join Professor David Lawson's research team. But that's no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,"" Vincent said, his tone sharp.

""Keep this up, Josie, and you're gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold-blooded?""

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn't respond.

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it.

This wasn't a dream. She was really here, face-to-face with Vincent‚Äîten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She'd somehow jumped back a decade.

1nkxi0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MyBali_Trips/comments/1nkxi0x/hidden_costs_most_firsttime_bali_visitors_forget/,Hidden Costs Most First‚ÄëTime Bali Visitors Forget About,"Hey everyone!  
I‚Äôve been living in Bali for many years now and helping friends plan their first trips - and I‚Äôve noticed that many people underestimate the real cost of a Bali vacation, especially when budgeting from abroad.

Yes, Bali *can* be affordable - but there are a handful of sneaky hidden costs that catch first-time visitors off guard. Let‚Äôs break them down so you don‚Äôt get blindsided.

# 1. Transport Costs Add Up Fast

* Scooter rentals seem cheap (\~80‚Äì120k/day), but factor in:
   * Gas (20‚Äì30k/day)
   * Helmets, surfboard racks, etc.
   * Potential *damage deposit scams*
* Grab/GoJek often unavailable in tourist hotspots like Uluwatu or Canggu at night ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to pay fixed-rate drivers (150‚Äì400k per ride).
* Airport pickup: Expect \~200‚Äì300k IDR to most areas. Don't fall for the overpriced booths just after customs.

>

# 2. Accommodation Extras

* Electricity is often NOT included in long-term villa rentals. ‚Üí Can be 500k‚Äì1.5mil IDR/month depending on your A/C habits.
* Some ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù stays have bad Wi-Fi - forcing you to buy coworking passes or extra data.
* Airbnb often doesn‚Äôt include cleaning fees, water refills, or trash pickup.

>

# 3. Tourist Entry Fees & Donations

* Many waterfalls, temples, and beaches charge entry:
   * Waterfall: 10‚Äì50k
   * Temples: 10‚Äì100k
   * Beach parking: 2‚Äì10k
* In rural temples, you may be asked for a *donation* \- which is optional, but culturally expected.

>

# 4. Visa Extensions, Taxes & ‚ÄúOnward Tickets‚Äù

* eVOA is \~$35 USD
* If you stay longer than 30 days:
   * Extension = \~$60‚Äì80 USD
   * Agent fees = extra
* Bali now charges a Tourist Tax (\~150k IDR) and sometimes asks for onward flight proof at check-in.

>

# 5. Health & Safety Surprises

* Bali Belly = pharmacy runs or clinic visits
* Scooter crashes = hospital bills if you're uninsured
* Travel insurance is a must - especially for adventurous activities or diving
* Arak (local alcohol) can be risky if bought in sketchy places - stay safe!

>

# 6. Island Hopping Isn‚Äôt Cheap

Thinking of visiting Nusa Penida, Lembongan, or Gili? Here‚Äôs what adds up:

* Fast boat tickets (250‚Äì500k return)
* Port ‚Äúfees‚Äù (5‚Äì25k)
* Paid parking at mainland harbor
* Limited Grab/GoJek on islands = private drivers only

>

# 7. Food & Drink Traps

* Fancy caf√©s charge Western prices (smoothie bowl + coffee = 100‚Äì150k)
* Tourist warungs often have inflated menus vs. local ones
* Service & tax in restaurants adds \~15‚Äì21% to bills

>

# Bonus: Digital Nomads & Long-Stayers

* Coworking memberships: 1‚Äì3 million IDR/month
* SIM card data packs: 100‚Äì250k
* Monthly visa runs (if not settled): flights + fees
* Gym/Yoga: 300k‚Äì1mil/month

# TL;DR - Budget Better, Enjoy More

Bali can still be affordable, but expect extra costs for:

* Transport (especially at night)
* Entry/parking fees
* Visa extensions
* Health + safety
* Island trips
* Long-stay utilities

Build in a buffer so you can say YES to the fun stuff without stressing about cash.

What should I expect at this point?,"Our breakup was chaotic, which I'm not proud of, since I broke up with her at a festival where she came to be with me. I asked for commitment, she said she cannot know what her life would be 3 months later but wanted to meet in the middle. I said no, regretted it immediately but too late. Her trust was broken. We drove 14 hours back and I cried 3 of them nonstop.

First days, she was mean, ghosting, not caring. I lost my self-respect, asking for gentle closure. A couple of days later, she said let's meet, I can cook healthy food. Then she got ‚Äúbusy‚Äù that day and ghosted again. I sent long anxious messages. Later, she sent breakup questions on insta, was mature, said she needs space and I wanna solve fast, so I appreciated.

The next day I went to Berlin (we planned together). She started liking everything i post on insta, texted me ‚Äúi love that you are well surrounded by friends.‚Äù I just said thanks. When I came back, I got anxious again, texted her how i want her back, she didn‚Äôt answer. Later she said she needs time, it was so much confusing and touching for her, will answer on Saturday. I thought maybe she is thinking of coming back. On Saturday, I saw her on Tinder with the pics I took, in my city, ""looking for a girlfriend"" (her bio). My patience was gone (not because of her being on tinder since im also there but not answering me to tell something) and texted her I‚Äôll get my clothes and this will be closure. She got angry, said I‚Äôm not respecting her need for space. Then silence. Big discard.

I didn‚Äôt text for 20 days, gave space, even started seeing someone new. Then she texted about giving my clothes back, maybe coffee. We met, she was stressed but I was chill. We said sorry, said we liked our time. She said she couldn‚Äôt answer me before because she was angry, and that even though she looked happy online, she was still dealing with pain. We decided to be friends. I said it's okay that she didn't answer, i get that we are coping this differently.

Then 10 days later, I asked her if she wants to meet and she said yes and we were discussing a movie. But I got so excited that I wanted to surprise her with something big and I got tickets for a sold-out festival where her fav artist is playing. I asked her if she would love to join me. She also got so excited and said how cute I am etc.

We met for the festival, had a great time. Confessed our loves, how we couldn't move on with other people. (I told her I had a partner after her but couldn't move on, she said she dated someone but couldn't like her because she was comparing with me). But I was insistent on going back, being intimate, even though she was saying that she would be hurt if she let herself kiss me again or her trust is broken and she does not want us back.

She said she wants to date other people without comparing them with me. But we kissed at the concert, and we had a genuine conversation about how she regretted that because it will hurt both of us. She apologized that she is so stubborn that she cannot go back. I was like sure, no worries, I like your presence in my life no matter what and was chill.

When we got into home, I wanted to sleep with her at the same bed but she didn't want and we slept in different rooms. The next morning she was completely cold. I felt weird, we couldn't even have a conversation. Always on phone or face-to-face ghosting.

I said I am sorry but I still love you and sorry that I'm insistent. She was like I'm not gonna go back, you hurt me so much etc. At that point, I was like ok. And I left.

On my way to my train I sent a message saying that I don't want to stay friends, I don't wanna ruin my healing. She was kind at first and said she understood and wished me good things. Then 15 mins later she said I will block you, and blocked me from everywhere.

Well, 5 days later, we came across in another festival in another country which was crazy. Her friends and her looked at me as I'm a monster, and when I said see you, she said ""I don't think so"". I felt like I missed an episode or something. We left in good wishes and what was that? idk.

Then, upcoming days, she posted some stories mentioning how she talks about her ex (me) all the time or she listens breakup songs all the time on insta, and my friends sent them to me.

And I sent an apology and self-reflection email to her lately. And said that my doors are always open for her.

That's the end. idk what would happen next but it looks like an end. :( sorry for oversharing.

1nkxfed,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1nkxfed/it_has_come_to_my_attention_that_maybe_i_have_a/,It has come to my attention that maybe I have a BED.,"So, I (31F) was very skinny all my life, up until about age 26ish. I got married at 22 and divorced at 25. I did gain some weight during marriage but I was happy and a healthy weight so I didn‚Äôt care. When I got divorced, I got so beyond depressed. The saddest, lowest time of my entire life. I was completely alone and I turned to food to fill the void. I gained about 35-40 pounds very quickly. This is so embarrassing to say but I would buy a large pizza everyday and eat it all at once for supper, then I would go to sleep. I eventually just didn‚Äôt have the money to do that anymore and I did continue making unhealthy food choices, but probably less destructive than a large pizza everyday.

Fast forward to a few months ago, I was talking with my psychiatrist about how I cannot l0se weight. I was on the shot and I only lost like 10 pounds in like a 5 month span, which is not worth the hundreds of dollars I was spending on the shot. Anyway, she asked me what my diet was like and if I ever binge eat. I take medication that can increase blood sugar and cause weight gain so, relevant question. I lied, I always lie anytime anyone asks me this question. However, it did put the idea in my mind that maybe I do have a BED and at the very least, I have a seriously messed up relationship with food. In the last few months, I have realized that I mindlessly eat. I live 20 minutes from town, I‚Äôll drive to town multiple times a day to get fast food. Sometimes I go to multiple places in one trip. For example, I went to Burger King for breakfast the other day. I ordered two BEC croissants and a lg DP. I ate all of that and went to a quick trip to Walmart..  which at Walmart I got a text from Sonic that they had $1.49 cheese sticks‚Ä¶ that was my next stop. I got cheese sticks and a lrg Coke Zero, ate/drank it all‚Ä¶ I do this quite often on my way to work. I work night shift and it‚Äôs common for me to go to Wendy‚Äôs and get a 10pc nugget with a large Coke Zero and then either go to 7Brew and get a large coffee or sonic band get something‚Ä¶ and then sometimes on top of all that, I‚Äôll door dash food in the middle of the night. 

I do not want to eat like this. I know it‚Äôs unhealthy and honestly, it‚Äôs shocking to me at I am *only* 40 lbs heavier than I was. No one knows that I eat like this. When I‚Äôm with people I am very mindful about how they might view how much I consume. I went to eat with my best friend the other day, we had Mexican.

My biker Wolf and Susan were k1ssing.

The sight of it seared in my brain, his hands gripping her arms like he wanted to throw her over the bar and take her right there, her slim body pressed hard against his.

""Are you okay?"" Tammy's voice pulled me back, her hand light on my arm.

""I'm sorry you had to see that."" She was trying to be kind, but her words were like daggers to my heart. ""But now she's pregnant, they need to be together for real, be a family.""

Susan's pregnant?

I couldn't take it anymore. I turned on the spot, running for the emergency exit, feeling like I was going to throw up.

Harper

The run-down house is past its prime. The paint's peeling, there's a hole in the front porch, and the porch swing hangs crooked. My concerns about the neighborhood are eased slightly as I spot some kids roaming the streets and signs that families live here-bicycles discarded on front lawns, swings in yards, and well-tended flowerbeds. Perhaps this won't be such a bad place for Jenny to grow up after all.

Although our new home is in dire need of some TLC, and it's not the nicest neighborhood, I couldn't be happier to move in. It's ours, our fresh start. Hopefully, the last one we'll ever need. I'm tired of starting over.

As we pull into the driveway, I notice three gleaming, impressively large motorbikes parked outside our new neighbor's house. No kids in that household, I'll bet.

""Jenny, we're here, honey,"" I say, gently waking my five-year-old.

She blinks awake, adorably rubbing her eyes as she comes to before taking in the scene. No doubt, she'll kick up a fuss when I try to remove the ivy that's taking over the side of the house.

""We're going to live here?"" she says gleefully.

I wish I could see the world through her eyes, where everything is magical. How she can look at this place and see anything other than a house that has remained unoccupied for years and feel wonder is beyond me. I suppose it is a step up from the small apartment we lived in before. To Jenny, the overgrown yard, knotted with weeds, is reminiscent of a fairytale, where the enchanted house slumbers, awaiting the prince. I don't have the heart to tell her that it doesn't work like that in real life; Prince Charming isn't going to come and save the day. It's just me and Jenny.

I hope I can be enough for her.

""We sure are, kiddo. Now, come help Mommy with the boxes,"" I say, climbing out of the truck and heading to the back to unload.

I'm grateful for my old, faithful truck. It managed to make it here without breaking down, and I was able to cram all of our belongings into it, so I didn't need to spend what little money I have left on renting a van.

I hand Jenny one of the lighter boxes filled with her toys and pick up a couple of heavier ones marked 'kitchen,' grunting slightly under the weight. Jenny rushes up the driveway, and I call out for her to be careful as she climbs the porch steps. I unlock the door, and we step inside our new home.

The house has an unlived-in, musty smell, and I start by opening the windows. It is almost dark; the journey took longer than expected, as Jenny had to stop frequently for the toilet. Soon, critters will make their way in, but I can air the place for a short while. Thankfully, the house is already furnished with the essentials, so I hope it won't take too long to unpack the rest of our stuff.

I head into the kitchen, placing the boxes on the countertop. Jenny follows behind me, clutching her box to her chest. ""Where does this box go, Mommy?""

""Your room. Shall we go pick which one you want?""

Her eyes light up with glee at the prospect, and she vigorously nods, too excited to speak. I take her box from her, and she sprints up the stairs, which creak in protest, and waits for me at the top. I've only seen photos of the place; it was too far to come to view it, but Jenny picks the room I anticipated would be hers. I take the main bedroom at the front of the house, and Jenny takes the one next to it. Then, there's the bathroom, and at the back is a small box room that overlooks the overgrown backyard. I plan to turn it into a home office.

I leave Jenny in her room, happily unpacking her things-which no doubt involves more playing than actual sorting-and continue to unload the truck. I ruefully notice that the bikes next door have gone. Presumably, the owner must have moved them into the garage. I'm annoyed that I missed the opportunity to catch a glimpse of my new neighbor. I wonder what kind of person owns three expensive motorcycles but still lives in this neighborhood. I envision an older gentleman who barely rides them but enjoys washing them in the yard every Sunday after church-a hobby, much like those who collect classic cars.

Hours later, having unloaded the truck, many of the boxes are still unpacked, as I've realized that, despite the rental agent's promise that the house would be cleaned, the kitchen still needs a thorough scrub. Rubber gloves on, I'm elbow-deep in a cupboard, standing on a chair, scrubbing away years of grime, when Jenny appears. ""Mommy, I'm hungry,"" she whines.

Startled, I bash my head on the cupboard. Rubbing my head, I climb down from the chair. I realize then how dark it is outside. I lost track of time; it's almost nine o'clock, past Jenny's bedtime, and well past dinner. Guilt and shame flood me for forgetting such a simple task as a mother.

""Sorry, sweetie, of course you are. Let's order pizza, shall we? A special treat,"" I offer, trying to ease my guilt.

""Yay!"" Jenny cries, unbothered by my terrible parenting. At five, being allowed to stay up late and eat pizza is a rare occurrence, and she's thrilled by it. ""Can we get barbeque chicken?"" she pleads.

At this point, I'd say yes to anything she asked, even though I'm already mentally calculating how much cash I have in my purse.

""Okay,"" I concede. ""But it's straight to bed after; it's well past your bedtime.""

I order the pizza, and while we wait, I rush around, closing all of the windows before getting Jenny ready for bed. I notice that there are several motorbikes parked outside, and the sounds of music and laughter drift over from the neighbor. It seems they're having a party.

An hour later, having eaten and put Jenny to bed, I collapse onto the couch, exhausted. I don't have the energy to unpack any more boxes. I mindlessly scroll through the TV channels, not settling on anything in particular. The party next door seems to be getting rowdier, and I glance at the stairs, concerned that they might wake Jenny. I'm so tired that I soon fall asleep on the couch. However, my peace is broken only a short while later by Jenny crying out for me. I notice that the party has only gotten louder.

With a frown, I head upstairs to comfort my child. The pungent smell of vomit hits me as I enter the room, and I notice she's thrown up on the floor. I rush over, panicked.

""Oh, sweetie, it's okay, Mommy's here.""

""I have a tummy ache,"" she moans.

I touch her forehead, relieved to find that she hasn't got a fever. It must be food poisoning from the pizza. I didn't eat much, and I mostly picked the chicken off. Jenny has always had a sensitive stomach, unlike me, who can eat almost anything without getting sick.

By the time I get Jenny cleaned up and settled in my bed with me, it's gone midnight, and the party is showing no signs of abating. I toss and turn, unable to sleep. Thankfully, Jenny is soundly sleeping beside me. I try to convince myself that this is just a one-off and the neighbors won't be doing this all the time, and I don't want to fall out with them on our first night, so I decide not to go over and ask them to keep it down.

However, when I'm still wide awake at two, I hear the unmistakable sounds of a couple having noisy s-x outside. I climb from my bed to peer out of the window into the neighbor's backyard, and my suspicions are confirmed when I see a threes0me taking place in the hot tub. I'm no prude, but I decide enough is enough; what if they were to wake Jenny and she saw? The realtor assured me that, while this wasn't the most affluent neighborhood, it was a safe and family-friendly one. If I don't say something about the noise now, what's to stop them from throwing parties like this every night? I'll be da-ned if I'm forced out of another home. I won't let people walk over me anymore.

Checking that Jenny is okay and still sleeping, I storm over to bang on the neighbor's door. By the time I get there, I've worked myself into a frenzy, and I'm livid. When there's no answer, I rap my fist against the door so hard it might leave a bruise. Finally, someone hears me, and the door opens.

An older man with a beer belly answers. Before he can speak, I launch into my tirade, explaining how I'm his new neighbor and the noise level is unacceptable when I have a sick child next door.

""Whoa, whoa, whoa, lady, slow down. This ain't my house. You're gonna have to speak to Wolf.""

""Fine, where is he?"" I ask, barging my way inside.

""He's sittin' over there.""

The man points to the living room, which looks more like a bar, complete with a pool table and a real bar. The room is packed with half-nak-d, gyrating bodies, the music deafeningly loud. I shove my way through, focused solely on my mission.

I'm momentarily thrown off my stride as I encounter the s-xiest man I've ever seen in the flesh. Dark hair with a smattering of silver at the temples that only makes him look hotter, a well-trimmed beard that frames his chiseled jawline, and piercing gray eyes. Those eyes lock onto me, and I freeze like prey, caught in the sights of a hunter. Unsurprisingly, he has a large tattoo of a wolf on his arm; whoever did it was obviously talented, as the detail is incredible and it is hauntingly beautiful.

He's sat in an armchair, but it may as well be a throne. I didn't need to ask which one was him; his presence is so commanding that it could only be him. He sits like a king at court, watching over his subjects with mild amusement. I can see why he's called Wolf; he has the wild energy and cool, focused gaze of one.

Shaking myself free of the spell he's put on me, I remind myself that, while he's hot, he's still an assh0le who throws loud s-x parties without a care for his neighbors. I stamp over to him.

""Are you Wolf?"" I demand, hands on hips.

""I am. Who are you?"" he replies, his voice commanding and clear.

""Harper, your new neighbor.""

""Let me guess, you've come to ask me to keep the noise down?""

His bored, mildly amused tone tells me I'm not the first neighbor to ask this, and that he thinks I won't be the last. If I'd had any say in where I lived, then this would be the last place I'd have picked. I wonder how many people have been driven out of their home because of this man?

""Yes. My daughter's sick, and I don't think it's too much to ask for you to keep the music down and not allow people to have s-x in your backyard!"" My voice trails off to a squeak of embarrassment at the end, and my cheeks flush.

He smiles slowly. ""And you enjoyed watching a little too much for your liking? Or perhaps you came over to join?""

His gaze explores my body, and for the first time, I realize that, in my rage, I've come over here wearing only my pajamas, which just so happen to be the least s-xy pair I own-a big baggy t-shirt from some cringey boy band I loved when I was younger, I got it at the first concert I ever went to back when I was a teen, and a hundred pounds heavier, and a pair of faded, too tight shorts. I shouldn't care how I look; it's not like I'm trying to impress this assh0le, I try to tell myself, but it's of little comfort. I'm still mortified. I'd rather Wolf and his pals think I'm the super-hot new neighbor than the crazy one. Perhaps I'm just imagining it, but his offer sure seems flirty. Almost as if he's inviting me to do it with him. I stop my thoughts from going down that road. He might be hot, but he's still an assh0le. I'm supposed to be done with assh0les.

""This isn't a f-cking porno, assh0le,"" I snap.

He chuckles, as if he finds my anger amusing. He rises from his chair, and I try not to ogle as I get a good look at his toned physique through the tight shirt he's wearing. He towers over me, a giant of a man, at least six-three. ""This is our territory, sweetheart. Has been for over twenty years. So why should I do a thing you ask, when you've been here all of five minutes?""

""I don't care if you've been here since the f-cking Stone Age; it doesn't mean you can't show some common respect and decency!"" I square up to him, refusing to let him intimidate me. I had enough of that sh1t with my ex, and I'm tired of being a pushover and treated like I'm weak.

Those smoldering gray eyes search mine with nak-d curiosity before he nods, almost imperceptibly. ""Bear, Hawk, go tell the randy f-ckers in the tub to take their party someplace else,"" he commands.

Two men, presumably Bear and Hawk, step forward. They're equally as hot, but in totally different ways to their leader. I can't believe I didn't notice them before.

The one who has to be Bear is even taller than Wolf, six-five, and at least two hundred and fifty pounds of pure muscle. He has a big bushy beard and a shaved head. His arm is tattooed with a full sleeve of what appear to be Norse symbols. You'd expect that, given his appearance, he'd be terrifying, yet somehow, he reminds me more of a cuddly bear than a wild one. Perhaps it's his kind brown eyes that meet mine as he offers me a slight, apologetic shrug, the trace of a smile dancing across his face.

Hawk is the total opposite of his companion. He's the shortest of the three but still stands over six feet. He has a tattoo of his namesake on his chest. I know this because he's wearing his leather vest with nothing underneath, revealing washboard abs. His lean, broad-shouldered physique reminds me of a swimmer. He has inky black hair that falls just above his shoulders, looking so shiny that one could almost describe it as feminine. That's if he didn't radiate a kind of lethal energy that makes me suspect he's the most deadly of the group. He surveys me with intense green eyes before turning his attention to Wolf, the clear leader.

""Got it, Prez,"" Bear agrees, his voice deep and booming, yet friendly at the same time. ""Nice to meet you, neighbor,"" he adds cheerfully, grinning at me before leaving the room with Hawk wordlessly following. I'm not sure if he's being genuine or sarcastic.

I turn my attention back to Wolf. He might have conceded to my one demand, but I'm not giving in that easily. ""I'm not leaving until you turn down the music,"" I say, folding my arms across my chest.

""Tempting,"" he purrs, and my cheeks flush all over again. ""Though, of course, you have a sick kid to get home to,"" he reminds me.

He's got a point. I've already been gone too long. What if Jenny wakes and finds me gone?

The worry must be written across my face as he takes pity on me and stops taunting me. ""Alright, everyone, party's over.""

To my surprise, almost immediately, everyone does as they're told and leaves. The only remaining stragglers are a few scantily dressed women, no doubt hoping to hang around and try to hook up with the guys.

""Thank you,"" I say through gritted teeth. I shouldn't have to thank him for doing the bare minimum most neighbors manage, but I don't want a feud.

He shrugs. ""Party was getting boring anyway, until you walked in,"" he says, fixing me with that intense gaze, and my legs feel weak. But then he adds, ""Don't expect us to start acting like Boy Scouts just because you didn't do your research before you moved in."" And I'm reminded of why I don't like him.

""Don't expect me not to call the police next time if you can't follow the law,"" I reply, smiling sweetly as I turn on my heel and, with all the integrity I can muster in my ratty pajamas, storm out.

To my relief, Jenny is still fast asleep when I return. I peek out the window at the now quiet house, and I feel a strange sense of triumph and relief when I notice the women who were lingering at the end are finally leaving, too. With the room now silent, sleep should come easily, and yet it doesn't. My turbulent thoughts are now filled with the three handsome strangers who live next door.

Wolf

Ever since she came marching into our house last night like an avenging angel, all fire and brimstone, I can't stop thinking about our new neighbor, Harper. She's a fierce lioness if I ever saw one. We only spoke for a moment, but I can already tell she'd do anything for her daughter. Lucky kid.

Her protectiveness only made her s-xier because she is s-xy, though I don't doubt that if you tried to tell her, she'd deny it. I could see the signs as clear as day that someone almost managed to douse her fire and made her feel less than the goddess that she is. I'm fascinated by her already. I want to know everything. But I also have a reputation to uphold. I can't let her blatant disrespect toward me go unpunished.

As with all the previous tenants, we start with a small, yet clear warning. In the early hours of the morning, while she was sleeping, we messed up her front lawn a little with our bikes and left them parked there. The message is clear-this is our turf.

Hawk and I are watching out of the front window in anticipation of her reaction when we hear Bear stomping down the stairs. ""She up yet?"" he asks with a yawn.

""Not yet,"" Hawk mutters, not looking around.

""Hey, make us some coffee, will you?"" I say, turning to Bear. ""Ugh. Put a shirt on. Nobody needs to see your hairy chest this early.""

""I thought Harper might. Figured I'd give her a front row ticket to the gun show,"" he says with a wink.

So it's not just me who's intrigued by our hot new neighbor. I shouldn't be surprised. We usually have the same taste in women. If you ask me, I can't think of a single man who wouldn't find Harper attractive.

Bear returns with our coffee just as the front door opens and Harper comes tearing outside, no doubt to confirm what she saw from her window. She's changed out of her pajamas into a simple white t-shirt and denim cut-offs, which hug her curves in all the right places. I allow myself to wonder if this skimpy outfit is for my benefit. I could tell that the attraction was mutual.

""This should be interesting,"" I say to the others.

We all crane forward, eager to watch her reaction. I'm hoping that she'll come right over and shout at me again. I've never enjoyed pissing a woman off so much before, or being spoken back to for that matter. To my surprise, she instead heads around the back of the house. When she reappears clutching a hose, Bear is the quickest to grasp the situation and goes running outside.

It's only when she turns on the hose to full power and aims it at our bikes that I catch up with what's happening.

Hawk and I rush outside after Bear. He's already close to Harper, shouting at her to stop. Harper simply turns the hose on him, soaking his jeans through. He holds up his hands in surrender, and she turns the hose back onto the bikes again.

""Harper, stop, the pressure could damage them!"" he booms, seeming to believe that Harper doesn't know exactly what she's doing. Does he think she's just giving them a nice wash for us?

Realizing she isn't going to stop, he wrestles the hose off her, soaking her in the process, before turning it off. There's a collective intake of breath from us men as we notice her white t-shirt is now see-through; it clings to her curves-perfect breasts, the nippl-s hard and showing through the lace of her bra, soft stomach, and hips just made for grabbing onto. My co-k twitches in my pants, and I feel like a schoolboy.

""You assh0le!"" she yells at Bear, pushing her wet hair from her face as she gapes at him in shock.

""Sorry, darlin', I didn't mean to get you wet. I just had to stop you. You could have damaged the bikes,"" he explains.

""It's just water.""

""High pressure,"" Bear grits out.

""Well, you should have thought about that before you messed up my yard,"" she mutters.

I stride over. ""Annoying when your neighbors think they can come onto your property and mess things up, isn't it?"" I remark casually. She glares at me with fire in her eyes, and I can't stop myself from provoking her further. She's just too godda-ned s-xy when she's mad. ""If you think that giving us a wet t-shirt show is going to stop us from doing this, you're sorely mistaken.""

She finally notices that her shirt is transparent, and she immediately crosses her arms over herself. ""I wasn't the one who got me wet,"" she hisses.

""We'd be happy to get you wet anytime, sweetheart,"" I promise, enjoying how her cheeks flush red as she gets the insinuation. ""No need to cover up that gorgeous body.""

I'm left wondering how she would have responded to that, because, at that moment, a little girl comes running out of the house. Harper's daughter, I presume.

""You're having a water fight without me, Mommy?"" she asks as she rushes over barefoot, still wearing pink pajamas, her hair in disarray, having just gotten out of bed. I'm not a big fan of kids, but even I have to admit this one is cute.

""Sorry, sweetie, you were sleeping,"" Harper replies, ruffling her hair and taking hold of her hand. I notice the subtle way she shifts to protectively place the child just behind her. I want to yell that we'd never hurt a child. It pains me that she'd think so. ""These are our new neighbors,"" she adds.

""Hi, I'm Jenny. What are your names?"" she asks innocently, hanging off of her mother's hand.

Bear, the best out of the three of us with kids, answers. ""I'm Bear, and these are my friends Wolf and Hawk.""

Jenny wrinkles her nose and looks up at him in confusion. Tilting her head, she replies, ""Those are silly names, you're boys, not animals.""

Bear chuckles. ""You're right, they're not our real names, they're nicknames. We got them when we were in the Army. I was a medic, and these two were soldiers. My real name is Ezra, Wolf is Logan, and Hawk is Silas, but we prefer to use our nicknames.""

Jenny nods, understanding. ""Are you called Bear because you're big and hairy like one?""

This makes us all laugh. Harper scolds her daughter. ""Jenny, don't be rude!""

""No, it's okay. You're right, kiddo,"" Bear says.

She nods, pleased to have her suspicion confirmed. She turns her attention to Hawk. ""Can you fly?"" she asks in awe.

""Unfortunately, not. It's because I'm good at watching things and spotting the small details, like a hawk,"" Silas explains patiently.

""I can see why you're Wolf,"" she says, turning her focus to me.

""Why's that?"" I say, expecting her to say, because I'm the leader or something.

There's nothing like a five-year-old to humble your ego.

""Because you're so gray!"" she replies triumphantly.

Again, this makes us all laugh, even Harper, who looks ready to grab her daughter and run at any second.

""I want a nickname,"" she declares, looking at us expectantly.

""Why? You're a little lamb,"" Bear replies affectionately.

Jenny scrunches up her face, frowning and crinkling her nose in disapproval. ""That's not very scary.""

""Well, no, but you don't need to be scary because your Mommy is a lioness,"" Bear explains. When Jenny still seems unconvinced, he continues, ""Being a lamb is pretty awesome. Lambs love to play. They have lovely curly hair just like you do, and they can jump really high. I bet you can jump higher than all your friends, can you?""

She nods enthusiastically and begins hopping on the spot to show him.

""See, you're the best lamb I ever saw.""

Jenny beams at Bear, completely won over by his charm. I feel a pang of jealousy when I see the look in Harper's eyes. It seems Jenny isn't the only one Bear has impressed.

""Come on, sweetie, our new neighbors have got things to do, and you need to get dressed. Say goodbye now and go on inside,"" Harper says to Jenny.

""Bye!"" Jenny says with an enthusiastic wave before running into the house.

Harper watches her go inside before turning back to us, her former fury returns. ""Get these bikes off my lawn,"" she demands, turning on her heel and storming off.

We all watch her walk away before doing precisely that. It's only when we get inside our place that we finally talk about her.

""da-n, she is something else,"" Bear says wistfully.

""Not that she knows it,"" Hawk points out.

""She's been hurt. Someone made her hate that gorgeous body. And no one moves into that house who isn't desperate or running,"" I reply.

We've worked our way through our fair share of neighbors, driving the price down. We've been hoping to buy the place and expand our clubhouse, but the owner's been stubborn. If we can drive yet another tenant out, we think he'll finally give in. Although I'm not so sure I want to get rid of Harper now.

When Bear says, ""We can change that,"" I know that my friends are as infatuated with Harper as I am.

We collectively decide then that we want Harper to be ours.

Our lioness.

Or maybe I did, in the way you fall off a bicycle and wake up on the pavement before you hit the ground. The city outside kept moving; trains hummed through the night, someone's TV droned behind the thin wall, and the jacket on the chair kept watching me like a guilty pet.

When the light finally came back, it was winter again flat, colorless, like someone had erased all the shadows with a bad brush.

My phone lay beside me on the futon, screen cracked from where I'd dropped it yesterday. New messages stacked up like receipts.

*Fraud.*  
*Privileged brat.*  
*Nepo kid idol caught lying.*

That last one stung the worst.  
Not because it was new, but because it had my face next to it.  
Except... it wasn't my face.

I opened one of the threads.

Someone had posted a screenshot of a blog, stark black serif text on white.

*""Commercialism is rot. To write for low-brow publications is to sell your voice to the factory. Amateur work is the only pure practice. Professionalism is a trap.""*

Underneath, my name:¬†**Rin Watanabe**, bold and undeniable.

The impostor had been writing essays.  
In my name.

She wrote about how she despised everything I stood for. How my career was a hollow product. How I was proof of a broken system an entitled, over-polished girl who'd been¬†*given*¬†the stage, not earned it.

Each word landed like a slap.  
Each post tore at something raw inside me.

Scrolling down, I found photos of me no one should have had. Me in my school uniform, me walking the back streets of my old neighborhood, even a grainy shot of my childhood home.

It felt like she had reached into my past and dug out every secret.

Like she wasn't just stealing my image now.  
She was rewriting my entire life.

I threw on the jacket¬†*the*¬†jacket because some part of me needed armor, even if it was paper-thin. Scarf, sunglasses, mask. The uniform of someone trying to disappear in plain sight.

Outside, Ikebukuro smelled different at eight a.m.stale bread from bakeries, scooter exhaust, and faint incense drifting from a nearby temple. My breath came out white, harsh against the cold.

I didn't even know where I was heading until my feet stopped.  
A coworking caf√© near the station.

I sat with my back to the window, ordered tea, opened my laptop.  
Search:¬†**Rin Watanabe blog**.

And there it was again.

*The Impostor Journal.*

Weeks' worth of posts, each more venomous than the last. Titles like¬†*Against Commercial Idols*¬†and¬†*How Nepotism Destroys Talent.*

Every entry signed with my official stage photo.  
Every lie carrying my face.

I clicked¬†**About**.  
A single line stared back at me:

*""I'm Rin Watanabe. This is the truth you weren't supposed to know.""*

My pulse spiked so hard I thought I'd vomit.

Her words weren't random.  
She wasn't just attacking me; she was dismantling everything I'd built, everything my family stood for.

My parents had been idols long before I was born.  
My mother, a singer whose voice could turn stadiums into confessions.  
My father, an actor who'd built his career on sincerity and charm.

I grew up watching them on glowing screens, voices echoing through our tiny apartment.

When I was six, my mother let me sit backstage before a concert. I remember the smell of hairspray and sugar candy, the sound of fans chanting her name like a prayer.

I remember thinking,¬†*I want this too.*  
Not just the stage.  
The love. The devotion.

But idols aren't just singers or dancers.

In Japan, idols are mirrors. You don't just perform you¬†*become*¬†someone your fans can believe in. You show them your flaws, your efforts, your tears, and they cheer not just for your talent, but for your growth.

It's not about being perfect.  
It's about being¬†*real*.

At least, that's the lie we tell ourselves.

I trained for years, entering public auditions, performing at local events, climbing step by shaky step. But no matter how hard I worked, everyone whispered the same thing:

*""Of course she got in. She's a Watanabe.""*

To them, I wasn't Rin, the girl who practiced until her voice cracked and her feet bled.  
I was just my parents' daughter a¬†*nepo kid*¬†handed a spotlight.

And maybe they were right.  
Maybe I'd never know if I deserved any of it.

But I¬†*needed*¬†to believe I'd earned something real.

Now, this impostor was taking even that away.

She wasn't just claiming to be me.  
She was painting me as the villain in her story the spoiled product of a corrupt system.

And people believed her.  
Because it made sense.  
Because it was easier to hate me than to see me.

A tap on my shoulder jolted me back.  
I nearly screamed.

Kana stood behind me, eyes red from exhaustion, mask pulled tight over her face.

""Rin,"" she hissed. ""You can't just sit here. The agency's going nuts. They want you to post a statement.""

""What kind of statement?"" My voice was sharp, brittle. ""*Hey guys, I'm not me?*""

Kana glanced at my laptop, lips thinning. ""She's escalated, huh?""

""She's writing manifestos now. In my name."" My hands trembled. ""People think I'm... her.""

Kana's eyes darted toward the door. ""We can't stay here. Come on.""

We ended up in a karaoke booth three floors above a drugstore, the kind of place high schoolers hide from their parents.

Kana locked the door and turned on the screen, but no music played. Neon lights flickered like anxious heartbeats.

""You know what this looks like?"" Kana's whisper was razor-thin. ""She's doing... amateur journalism about you.""

I laughed, a broken sound. ""Amateur journalism? She's¬†*ruining my life*.""

""Maybe she thinks she's proving something.""

""What, that she's more authentic than me? That she's some kind of anti-idol crusader?""

Kana didn't answer.  
Her silence said enough.

The karaoke screen blinked.  
A new message scrolled across it like fake lyrics:

*Don't be mad. I'm just making you interesting.*

My stomach dropped. ""Kana... look.""

The words faded. Another line appeared.

*Check your locker at Studio B.*

My skin went ice-cold. ""She's in the system,"" I whispered.

Kana's face drained of color. ""We need to tell security.""

But I was already standing. ""No. I'm going.""

""Rin‚Äî""

""If I don't, she wins.""

Studio B's back hallway smelled of dust and stale hairspray.  
My locker sat at the very end, paint chipped, stickers peeling.

I opened it slowly.  
Inside: a plain manila folder.

When I pulled it out, photos spilled across the floor.

Me at twelve, clumsy and gap-toothed.  
Me at my first audition.  
Me at the hospital the night my father died.

Private moments no one should have.

On top, a handwritten note:

*You don't know me yet.*  
*But I know you.*  
*Amateurism is practice for the real thing.*  
*This is my practice.*  
*You are my practice.*  
‚Äì¬†**R**

The folder smelled faintly of coffee and cigarettes.  
Exactly like the impostor in the Ikebukuro photo.

My throat closed. My knees hit the cold tile.

I thought about her essays, about her calling me a hollow product while using my name to gain an audience.  
About her mocking me as a ""nepo kid"" while clawing at the very spotlight she claimed to despise.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.  
Unknown number.

*Enjoy the archive?*

My fingers shook as I typed back:¬†*Who are you?*

Three dots.  
Then:

*You, but better.*

For a long moment, I couldn't breathe.  
Because she didn't just look like me.  
She¬†*believed*¬†she was me.

Kana found me sitting on the floor, clutching the note.

""Rin,"" she whispered, terrified. ""Agency's calling the police. We need to leave.""

I stood, voice hollow but steady. ""No. I'm going to find her first.""

This wasn't just about a stolen jacket or a fake smile.  
This was war.  
And only one of us could be Rin Watanabe.

At first, I thought he had a bit of a ‚Äúf\*ckboy vibe,‚Äù so I declined his invite. But he called me, sent me a bar location, and I was like, nah, too far. I suggested something closer to my place. He admitted he doesn‚Äôt really go out, and he actually expected *me* to know more places because I gave off ‚Äúparty vibes‚Äù from my photos. Truth is, I‚Äôm a homebody‚ÄîI only go out once in a blue moon when my friends are free.

He then said, ‚ÄúMaybe we can just walk and find a place?‚Äù and I was like, ‚ÄúYeah sure.‚Äù When I first saw him in person, honestly na-starstruck ako. He looked way better than his photos‚Äîvery classy and mature vibes, almost intimidating. He later admitted he was shy and thought I‚Äôd be ‚Äúmaarte‚Äù or difficult, so he didn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd like. But we just kept it chill, hopped around places, and actually talked a lot.

On that first date, he told me he‚Äôs a single dad who came out of an 11-year relationship. He asked me about deal breakers, and I told him I‚Äôm also a single mom. He was respectful the whole time‚Äîeven made sure I got home safe when I was tipsy.

Then we had a coffee date, and he even dropped by my place just to hang out. I joked if he could help me assemble my cabinet (lol). He was busy, but he still reached out. Later, he straight up asked if I liked him, because he likes me and wants something serious. I felt pressured, because I *do* like him too‚Äîbut it‚Äôs only been 3 weeks.

Last night, he invited me again. We ended up at an Airbnb, talked, played music, drank, and stayed up until 4AM. Then we fell asleep beside each other‚Ä¶ and yeah, something happened.

  
Another thing: he‚Äôs already talking about future plans, like going to Liwa Liwa or Elyu with me. Does that mean he‚Äôs serious about me, or is it just talk?

 I don‚Äôt want to end up being a *kabit* . He says he‚Äôs single, but we‚Äôve only known each other for 3 weeks. I‚Äôm scared I might be blind-siding myself.

Also, I‚Äôm confused about *myself*. I promised myself that if another man ever touched me, I could never go back to my ex. And now that it happened, I know I can‚Äôt go back. But part of me is still questioning‚Äîwhy did I let this happen so fast? Are my feelings for him real, or just me being lost and vulnerable right now? idk lol

So guys, I really want your opinion.  
If a guy does all this‚Äîopens up about being a single dad, is respectful, makes future plans like trips together, and even says he wants something serious after 3 weeks‚Äîdoes that usually mean he‚Äôs actually serious? Or could it just be part of the game?",1,1758267631.0,AskPinoyMen,4,1.0,False

1nkx5g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1nkx5g3/tod_mikuriya_grandfather_of_medical_marijuana/,Tod Mikuriya: Grandfather of Medical Marijuana,"If there is one person with a claim to reviving the pharmacopoeia of cannabis in the post-prohibition age ‚Äîand thereby undermining prohibition‚Äôs pseudo-scientific foundations ‚Äî that person was Tod Mikuriya.  
Dr. Tod Mikuriya was a critical force in the successful and ground-breaking effort to legalize medical cannabis in California in the 1990s. Now his papers are available to researchers through a newly archived collection at the National Library of Medicine.

The Berkeley psychiatrist, who died in 2007, was hailed as the grandfather of the medical cannabis movement, backing up the activists with unimpeachable scholarly chops to the rage of the Drug War establishment. It was hard to assail his credibility, as he had actually headed up the National Institute of Health‚Äôs cannabis research program in the 1960s before defecting to the side of the people being studied, so to speak.

# An ‚ÄòInappropriate Attack of Curiosity‚Äô

Mikuriya was born in a rural part of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bucks County in 1933, to mixed German and Japanese immigrant stock. This obviously made him the target of prejudice during his childhood in World War II, an experience to which he would later attribute his rebellious streak.

Mikuriya received his bachelor‚Äôs degree in psychology from Reed College in Oregon in 1956, before serving a medic in the Army. He then went to medical school at Philadelphia‚Äôs Temple University, where the turning point in his life occurred.

As he would years later relate to video-journalist Ruby Dunes on the sidelines of a cannabis conference in Santa Barbara, in 1959 Mikuriya was ‚Äústruck by an inappropriate attack of curiosity‚Äù after reading an unassigned chapter in a pharmacology textbook that mentioned the widespread medicinal use of cannabis in the United States before it was outlawed in 1937.  
He was sufficiently intrigued that on summer break between semesters that year, he overcame his ingrained fear and traveled to Mexico to seek the stuff out, buying a small quantity from a street-dealer. Nothing would ever be the same for him.

In 1966, Mikuriya began directing the drug addiction treatment center of the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute, at Princeton. That same year, he travelled to Morocco‚Äôs hashish heartland of the Rif Mountains, where he smoked kif with Berber tribesman who had resisted French colonial efforts to stamp out cannabis smoking.

It was also during this period that he discovered and immersed himself in the works of Sir William Brooke O‚ÄôShaughnessy, the Irish physician who researched the long tradition of medicinal use of cannabis in India in the 19th century. Mikuriya came to view O‚ÄôShaugnessy as a ‚Äúpersonal hero.‚Äù

Mikuriya was also among the first scholars to re-explore the findings of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report, the 1894 study ordered by British colonial authorities to examine the supposed cannabis problem in the subcontinent, which instead determined that use is ‚Äúeither harmless or even beneficial.‚Äù

In 1967, Mikuriya became a researcher at the Center for Narcotics & Drug Abuse Studies of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), itself a division of the National Institutes of Health. This agency was the predecessor of today‚Äôs National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). There, he headed up what he would later call the government‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst overground cannabis research program.‚Äù (He would learn there was a ‚Äúconcurrent secret study‚Äù going on at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, linked to the CIA‚Äôs search for truth serums and psychotropic warfare agents.)

He was dispatched to California for the study, to observe the habits of the hippies who were then bursting upon the scene. But as Martin Lee writes in his book *‚ÄúSmoke Signals: A Social History of Cannabis,‚Äù* ‚ÄúMikuriya realized that as far as cannabis was concerned he had more in common with the reefer rebels he visited in Northern California than with the ‚Äòrepressed bureaucrats‚Äô who debriefed him when he returned from the West Coast.‚Äù

In 1968, Mikuriya stepped down from his NIMH position and moved to Berkeley, where he took up a private psychiatric practice. The most important work of his life was about to begin.

# Intellectual Force Behind Medical Cannabis Push

In 1972, Mikuriya published the *Cannabis Medical Papers: 1869-1972*, a germinal work that was instrumental in launching the modern movement for medical cannabis.

As this movement began to take off in California amid the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, Mikuriya came to be seen as the intellectual prowess behind the activist efforts.

San Francisco‚Äôs cannabis crusader Dennis Peron was viewed as the key architect of Proposition 215, the 1996 ballot measure that made medical cannabis legal in California, but it was Mikuriya who helped draft the text. If Peron was the father of the medical cannabis movement, Mikuriya was its grandfather, providing guidance behind the scenes.

After the passage of 215, he founded *Mikuriya Medical Practice*, which lives on today and touts itself as ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äôs original medical cannabis consultation service.‚Äù During this period, he was writing numerous medical cannabis recommendations for patients every day. He was fondly known to his following as ‚ÄúDr. Tod.‚Äù

In the following years, he would found the California Cannabis Research Medical Group and its latter offshoot, the Society of Cannabis Clinicians.

But his open stance also attracted unwelcome if inevitable attention from the authorities. President Bill Clinton‚Äôs hardline drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, publicly derided Mikuriya‚Äôs medical practice and advocacy as ‚Äúthe Cheech and Chong show.‚Äù

Finally, in 2000, the Medical Board of California accused Mikuriya of unprofessional conduct for allegedly failing to conduct proper physical examinations on 16 patients for whom he had recommended cannabis. The case was based on the testimony of undercover agents, including police. He would tell the medical board at his disciplinary hearing, ‚ÄúNever before had a fake witness infiltrated my practice and created a fraudulent medical record. It‚Äôs most upsetting.‚Äù

None of his legitimate patients complained about his conduct ‚Äî on the contrary, several testified to the Medical Board in his defense.

In 2004, the Medical Board gave Mikuriya five years‚Äô probation and a $75,000 fine. He appealed the ruling, and was allowed to continue practicing under the supervision of the state-appointed monitor.

# ‚ÄòFirst-line Medication‚Äô

Mikuriya died of cancer in May 2007. His obituary in the *New York Times* noted that he was reported to have recommended cannabis for nearly 9,000 patients.

And he was quite out of the closet about his own use. As the *Los Angeles Times* reported in 2004, ‚ÄúHe willingly acknowledges, unlike most of his peers in cannabis consulting, that he does indeed smoke pot, mostly in the morning with his coffee.‚Äù

As Mikuriya told Ruby Dunes in the interview the year before he died, ‚ÄúCannabis is far less dangerous than most any other medication you can think of, especially when dealing with chronic conditions. Cannabis should be looked on as a first-line medication, instead of it being something that you try when you give up on all the conventional treatments.‚Äù

I don't see him much because we don't live together but given any time he can spare, I make room and time to see him. I genuinely love this man and I do plan to spend the rest of my life with him.

I never want to take that away from him and I try to support him in any way possible. I see him at his convenience, because he a very busy guy.

We met on Grindr when I was at the ass end of my 8 year divorce from my ex-husband about 1.5 years ago. No bad blood with my ex-husband, just a sad time in my life. The time between my divorce and meeting my partner, it was pretty well known I sort of got around in our small town. When I became exclusive with my partner and started dating him, he realized how much of a slut I was in town. He was annoyed but ultimately I was his now.

My partner has also expressed to me that in his previous relationship, his last partner broke up with him. My partner explained to me that his ex cheated on him and that his ex wanted an open relationship which ended their relationship. So I know my partner has a bit of trauma when it comes to commitment and infidelity, which I try to be very sensitive to.

**The Situation:** About two months ago. My partner and I got into an argument about some of the people I know in town. The other day, we both attended a public event and a mutual friend introduced himself to us. This friend, knew us both. He knew my partner in a professional sense, and I knew him as a previous fling. My partner, in the midst of an argument accused me of cheating on him. I tried to tell him that this fling was before our time, and that the town is small, and that the entire gay population in town pretty much knows everyone. My partner told me he just doesn't trust me because I have all day to myself  when he's working. I told him he was being a little unfair because I don't shame him for sleeping with other men that I'm friends with before our time. In response, he demanded he look through my phone.

I've been very open and honest with him and this was a boundary I'm not personally comfortable with. Not because I have anything to hide, it just feels very invasive for hostile reasons. Previously, he has used my phone and gone through it when mapping out directions or googling something and even reading conversations in my text messages. But this, just felt very... not good? and it just made me feel very uncomfortable, like I was being attacked.

I told him how this made me feel and he told me he had no reason to trust me anymore because I wouldn't let him go through my phone. I told him I completely understand how he feels and I don't blame him for how he feels.

We kept arguing and the conversation boiled down to ideas about who I can and cannot talk to. My partner didn't want to put boundaries on who I can talk to, but he had told me that he had no other assurance as to my commitment to him. I agreed to not talk to any gay men or have any gay friends for the sake of our relationship because I really do love this man. I told him it was hard to reconcile my deep feelings for him and my boundaries when it comes to my own privacy around my phone, but I will try to work on those feelings. My partner cut off our conversation abruptly and tried really hard to change the subject and we continued on like nothing happened... until we visited his parents place for labor day.

While spending time with his family, we helped around the home doing chores. While taking out the trash together, we were told to take one of the trash cans from the dumping areas back to their home. We were unsure which ones to take back, so I asked my partner to take a picture of it and send it to his father. When my partner grabbed my phone, I saw him look through my messages and then open up the camera. I didn't say anything about it. While taking a picture of the trash cans, a fling I had 10 years ago, texted me, ""Happy Labor Day ;)"" His contact was still labeled as his *Adam4Adam* handle, Big Cock John. My partner asked who that was and I told him, a fling from 10 years ago and l laughed because of the silly name still in my contacts. My partner laughed and we took the trash cans back.

On the ride home, my partner was furious with me. He told me he just didn't know how he could trust me, especially after that text message I got when we took out the trash. I told him that I understand how he feels and I honestly have no other explanation for him other than the truth that a fling from 10 years ago randomly texted me out of the blue. He asked again for my phone and now I had those bad vibes again. I told him, ""I don't know how else to say this, but I don't know how I can convince you to trust me. This feels just very wrong to me."" He wanted to drop the conversation after that. And he continued the ride home like nothing happened. I would have given him my phone but he didn't want it anymore after I said that.

Since then I moved passed that argument, even though nothing really got resolved. I wanted to talk about it but I get very little time with him as it is, and I want to spend the time I do have with him doing things together we both enjoy. I don't want to argue or fight, I just want to watch bad movies together, cook him dinner, and have a drink.

Last week, my partner made an off handed comment about our relationship. He told me he was very surprised that I found our relationship was going well. I told him, ""Well, relatively speaking, I know things can be way worse. Despite some of our problems, I'm very happy being his partner. Do you think we're doing bad?"" He told me he didn't, but I don't think he was being honest because of how he brought up the subject.

**The Question:** I don't know what to do. I think my partner is convinced that I'm cheating on him and I don't know how else to prove it to him that I haven't and I love him so god damn much. I feel so stuck. In the past 3 or 4 months, I was accused of cheating on him 4 times. I don't know how else to convince him otherwise. What do I do? The more I think about it, the more I think we have to break up because there's just a lack of trust, but I truly love him and I don't want to lose him. I've never cheated on him or in any relationship that I've had. Is this relationship salvageable? Is there something I can do? I just don't know how else I can be there for him and let him know that I love him.

At the time I was married so I told her I was not interested.

Since then me and my wife have separated and I am curious to know who it was as I never got a last name.

All I know is, her name is Kayla, she went to notre dame, she would have graduated after 2008 (one to two years after).

That's all the information I have, if you know who this might be, let her know I am interested in connecting.

A little context about myself: 
I have been a black coffee lover for the past 3 years and this month i decided to started brewing my own coffee at home.

I researched and bought Aeropress as it‚Äôs the best beginner friendly method to brew a good cup of coffee.

It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since i‚Äôve been brewing and i tried a few recipes also but overall I‚Äôm finding Hoffmann‚Äôs recipe the perfect one for me.

I drank a lot of BT in the past 3 years, but for brewing i went ahead with Araku Selection and man o man the aroma of the coffee is so good. (Do note: i bought ground coffee - Fine)

To try more coffee, today i ordered Tulum‚Äôs Sampler pack from Cred store.

I‚Äôve got a few questions if anyone could answer i‚Äôll be thankful.

1) Will investing in temperature kettle + Grinder make my coffee more flavourful (as currently I‚Äôm buying ground coffee)

2) I‚Äôm performing the exact recipe but i feel my coffee is sour (what could be the reason?)

3) Very novice question: does water also matter eg RO water vs mineral water?

4) what is the significance of Metal filter vs paper filter vs double paper filter in Aeropress

5) How does one identify the notes because the coffee I‚Äôm drinking currently has Dark chocolate, honey, caramel, sugarcane notes but i can only identify Dark chocolate flavour.

Other thing is a grinder I found. Yeah, I know I asked you all for a grinder but since I'm extra broke, found this local brand: [link](https://kiwi.com.tr/kspg-4822-302-pt).

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Lyon vs. Angers: A Tale of Two Teams (One with a Sieve for a Defense, the Other with a Sloth for an Offense)**

**Parsing the Odds: Lyon‚Äôs Implied Invincibility**  
Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: Lyon is the statistical favorite here, and the numbers aren‚Äôt just suggesting it‚Äîthey‚Äôre shouting it. The decimal odds from bookmakers like FanDuel (1.42) and BetRivers (1.4) imply Lyon has a **70%+ chance** of winning, per the formula `1 / decimal_odds * 100%`. For context, that‚Äôs roughly the reliability of a coffee machine in the morning. Angers, meanwhile, sits at a laughable 13% (7.5 odds), which is about the same chance your dry cleaner will return your favorite jacket unshrunken. The draw? A 21% shot, which is generous considering Lyon‚Äôs recent 4-1 collapse against Rennes.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: Lyon‚Äôs implied probability hinges on their **six-game home winning streak** at the Groupama Stadium, where they‚Äôve been as dominant as a toddler with a thimble in a pie-eating contest. Angers, by contrast, is 12th in Ligue 1, with one win (against promoted Paris FC, no less) and a knack for losing to everyone else. On paper, this is a mismatch. In practice? Let‚Äôs check the news.

**Digesting the News: Lyon‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlawless‚Äù Start (Until It Wasn‚Äôt)**  
Lyon began the season like a Swiss watch‚Äîthree perfect wins, zero goals conceded. Then came Rennes: a 1-0 lead, a red card, and a 4-1Ê∫ÉË¥• in the final 10 minutes. It was soccer‚Äôs version of a magician accidentally setting fire to the stage. Now, Lyon needs to ‚Äúremet la t√™te √† l‚Äôendroit‚Äù (put their heads back together), as the article says. Will they? Possibly. Do they have the squad depth to avoid repeating that disaster? Well, their lineup includes names like **Tolisso, Fofana, and Karabec**‚Äîplayers who sound like they belong in a Renaissance fair

When encountering the 4Cs (Carat Weight, Clarity, Color, Cut) for the first time, many people must feel confused. How exactly to choose? Brides-to-be, hurry up and save this diamond ring selection guide!

üíé 1. Color

	‚Ä¢	No need to fixate on the ""best"" color. For natural diamonds: choose D-F with a high budget; G or H are cost-effective options. For lab-grown diamonds: D, E, or F are recommended.

	‚Ä¢	Natural diamonds below J color tend to have a yellowish tint. If setting with 18K yellow gold, these can be chosen‚Äîthe warm tone of 18K gold complements them nicely. Even lower color grades are acceptable with 18K yellow gold settings. The diamond in Figure 3 is grade N, and it still looks beautiful and vintage, doesn‚Äôt it?

	‚Ä¢	For fancy color diamonds, Intense and Vivid grades are recommended. After all, fancy color diamonds are bought for their color‚Äîavoid overly pale hues.

üíé 2. Clarity

	‚Ä¢	Cost-effective choice: VS1-VS2. This clarity is sufficient and eye-clean.

	‚Ä¢	VVS or above: For those pursuing high quality with a generous budget.

	‚Ä¢	Below SI1: May have visible inclusions to the naked eye, not recommended.

üíé 3. Cut

	‚Ä¢	With a sufficient budget: 3EX (Excellent Cut, Polish, Symmetry) is recommended‚Äîcut determines a diamond‚Äôs sparkle.

	‚Ä¢	Cost-effective choice: Ensure Cut is at least EX; Polish and Symmetry can be VG (Very Good).

	‚Ä¢	If budget is really tight: VG is acceptable. Avoid lower cuts, as they result in less brilliance and poor sparkle.

üíé 4. Carat Weight

	‚Ä¢	This refers to the ""size"" of the diamond. All else equal, larger diamonds are more expensive‚Äîchoose based on your budget and preference.

	‚Ä¢	Opt for 1.02ct instead of 1.00ct. Due to measurement errors, avoid integer carat weights; an extra 1-2 points is better.

	‚Ä¢	For natural diamonds, 0.98ct is more cost-effective than 1.01ct.

	‚Ä¢	Choose diamond size based on your ring size and hand shape (search ""ring size"" on my homepage for a detailed guide).

üíé 5. Diamond Certificates

	‚Ä¢	Loose diamond certificates: Must have one of GIA/IGI/HRD/NGTC.

	‚Ä¢	Finished diamond ring certificates: NGTC (National Gemstone Testing Center) certificate.

	‚Ä¢	Prioritize diamonds with authoritative certificates. A loose diamond certificate plus a finished product certificate provides double assurance.

üî∏ Additional Tips

	‚Ä¢	Avoid diamonds with strong fluorescence, ""milky"" or ""coffee"" tones. Fluorescent diamonds emit blue, yellow, etc., under sunlight or UV light, and some may look ""oily"". Milky/coffee diamonds appear cloudy, not bright or white, and lack sparkle.

	‚Ä¢	Diamonds of I color or below can have medium-strong fluorescence. The blue fluorescence neutralizes the diamond‚Äôs yellow tint, enhances its brightness and whiteness, making it look whiter.",6,1758266600.0,RepHermes,5,1.0,False

I‚Äôve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically Rakuten, Temu, and Amazon. I‚Äôll write a few words about each so you understand why I‚Äôm asking here. :)

Rakuten:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn‚Äôt even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn‚Äôt started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it‚Äôs a horror story. I‚Äôm amazed they‚Äôre still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that‚Äôs a no, I don‚Äôt want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

Temu:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

Amazon Associates:

You‚Äôd think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon‚Äôs growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I‚Äôve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn‚Äôt count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed, and it seems like it‚Äôs not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren‚Äôt good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days ‚Äî not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

So, as you can see, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed, and it seems like it‚Äôs not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren‚Äôt good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days ‚Äî not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

My footsteps echoed through their pathetic excuse of a home as I stormed in, my jaw clenched so tight I could feel a vein pulsing in my temple. The air reeked of desperation and fear‚Äîexactly what I expected from someone who owed my family money.



""Jimmy Pierce."" I didn't ask. I stated his name like the verdict it was.



The man who stumbled forward looked nothing like the confident businessman who'd approached my father six months ago. His eyes darted around the room like a cornered animal, hands trembling as he attempted to straighten his wrinkled shirt.



""Mr. Blackwood... I wasn't expecting you today."" His voice cracked. Pathetic.



I raised an eyebrow, letting the silence stretch uncomfortably before responding. ""That was rather the point. My father sends his regards."" I pulled out the ledger from my jacket pocket, tossing it onto their coffee table. ""And his bill.""



This debt is long overdue, and I'm not leaving without something of value. These people are beneath me, but business is business.



Jimmy grabbed the paper with shaking hands, his face draining of color as he read the figure. His wife hovered nervously in the doorway, her knuckles white as she gripped the wooden frame.



""There must be some mistake,"" Jimmy stammered. ""This is twice what I borrowed. The interest‚Äî""



""Is exactly what you agreed to,"" I cut him off. ""You knew the terms when you signed.""



""Please, Mr. Blackwood."" Jimmy took a step toward me, hands outstretched in supplication. ""I can offer you something else‚Äîa partnership in my new venture. It's going to be big, I swear. Just give me another month and‚Äî""



The crack of my fist connecting with his jaw echoed through the room. He crumpled to his knees, blood trickling from his split lip.



""I don't negotiate."" I towered over him, adjusting my cufflinks. ""And I certainly don't enter partnerships with men who can't honor their debts.""



His wife rushed forward with a strangled cry. ""Please don't hurt him! We'll find a way to pay, I promise!""



They're both on their knees now. Good. They should know their place.



""You had six months,"" I said, my voice dangerously soft. ""My father was generous. I am not.""



My gaze drifted around their living room‚Äîcheap furniture, faded carpet, nothing of value except... My attention caught on a silver-framed photograph on the mantel. I stepped toward it, ignoring their continued pleas.



The girl in the photo was stunning‚Äîraven hair cascading over one shoulder, eyes that seemed to challenge the camera, a slight curve to her lips that wasn't quite a smile. Something twisted in my chest as I picked up the frame.



""Who is this?"" I demanded, not taking my eyes off her image.



The silence that followed was heavy with tension. I looked back to find Jimmy and his wife exchanging a panicked glance.



""That's our daughter,"" Jimmy finally answered, his voice tight. ""Antalya.""



""Antalya,"" I repeated, testing the name on my tongue. It tasted exotic. Intriguing.



A plan began forming in my mind‚Äîone that would satisfy the debt and give me something far more valuable than money.



I strongly feel that she is my mate. I was looking for her for years; finally, I found her.



""Where is she now?"" I asked, turning the frame in my hands.



""She's at university,"" her mother blurted out. ""Please leave her out of this. She knows nothing about the loan.""



I smiled then, and watched them both flinch. ""I think I've found my payment.""



""No!"" Jimmy struggled to his feet. ""Take the house, take everything we own, but not our daughter!""



I signaled to Marco, my enforcer who'd been silently watching from the doorway. ""Break his leg.""



""Wait!"" Jimmy cried out. ""Please, Mr. Blackwood! She's innocent in all this!""



""Should have thought about consequences before you borrowed money you couldn't repay."" I shrugged, unmoved by his tears. ""One broken leg seems merciful, considering your debt.""



The sickening crack that followed, accompanied by Jimmy's scream, didn't faze me. I was still staring at Antalya's photograph, memorizing every detail of her face.



""Have your daughter at my estate tomorrow,"" I instructed her mother, who was sobbing over her husband's crumpled form. ""She'll work off your debt.""



""What kind of work?"" she asked fearfully.



I smiled. ""That's between me and Antalya.""



Before leaving, I crouched beside Jimmy, who was moaning in pain. ""If you try to run, if you warn her, if you do any nuisance‚ÄîI'll know. And next time, I won't be so merciful.""



Outside, I breathed in the cool evening air, feeling strangely alive. The photograph pressed against my chest in my suit pocket, and I could almost feel her heartbeat matching mine.



""Soon,"" I whispered to myself, a promise and a vow. Antalya Andrews would be mine, no matter what it took.

Am I missing something? Did I forget about a special bond Belly and Conrad formed over gourmet coffee? Did Susannah leave her an antique French press in the will?

My wife lied about 4 days with another man, and now we‚Äôre trapped between love and divorce.","[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1nkbdbp/30m30f_together_10_years_she_lied_about_spending/) was my first Reddit post. I read your comments and realized that I told the story very superficially, leaving out important details.

She had a work conference in another city. They didn‚Äôt provide a hotel, so I booked one for her and bought train tickets both ways. She suggested we go together, but I preferred to stay home, deal with some work issues, and also spend the weekend playing GTA Online.

On the evening of her departure, we went to the train station together. I walked her onto the train and put her bag on the top shelf since she couldn‚Äôt reach it. I was even thinking she might have to ask someone to take it down for her later. Three hours passed, the train arrived at the destination, and she texted me about it. I asked if she had any problems with the bag; she replied that people helped her. Then she went to the hotel.

I had access to see her card transactions, and I noticed she didn‚Äôt pay for the taxi. I texted her asking if everything was okay, if there weren‚Äôt any problems with the taxi. She said the taxi services there were strange ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt accept cards, only cash. At that moment, I realized she was lying to me.

Why was I checking her transactions? I never really forbade my wife anything: if she wanted to go somewhere with someone, fine ‚Äî just keep me updated and don‚Äôt disappear. I trusted her. But still, from time to time, I looked at her spending. When she went out for coffee with that guy or somewhere else, he always paid for her. Once I asked her directly ‚Äî do you let other men pay for you? She said he always insisted. I told her: you have a husband who can pay for you, don‚Äôt let others do it, always split the bill at least.

Back to the taxi: that‚Äôs how I knew something was off. Naturally, the next days were already tense.

That evening, she got to the hotel. We had a video call, and she sent me photos of the room ‚Äî we had this tradition, always photographing the hotel room. She said she was tired, would take a shower, and go to bed. For me, it was strange: it was only 9 PM, and she never went to bed earlier than 11 PM. Still, I didn‚Äôt bother her, even relaxed a bit myself. In the morning, I saw a text from her sent at 1:30 AM ‚Äî ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

The next day, she sent photos from the conference, we texted. Then she said she‚Äôd go out with some people from the conference. A few hours later, she texted that she was already back at the hotel. We had a call, everything seemed fine. I checked her card transactions ‚Äî nothing. I understood she was with him. Then silence again after 9 PM. Around 11:30 I called her, we spoke a bit, I told her I felt uneasy. We wished each other goodnight, and after 1 AM she again texted ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

The same rhythm continued the next day of the conference. Evening again, no card transactions. This time I panicked. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, my mind was racing. I thought she would come back and tell me everything. She had never lied to me before ‚Äî at least I had never suspected it.

On the morning of her departure, we were texting from early morning. I was waiting for her return. The train was supposed to leave at 9:55, but at 9:40 she was still at the hotel according to Find My ‚Äî we could see each other‚Äôs location, though I mostly used it. That looked extremely suspicious ‚Äî my wife always came to the station early, afraid of being late. Never once in her life had she cut it close. I realized something was wrong. I asked her, and she replied there were issues with calling a taxi. In the end, she made the train and arrived on time. I met her. But right before she came out of her carriage, a guy stepped out of the neighboring one ‚Äî looked just like him. I already knew there would be a very hard conversation at home. I even joked, asking if that wasn‚Äôt him, but she said no ‚Äî though by then, we both knew the truth.

At home, we first talked about the conference, she shared impressions, but both of us were waiting to see who would bring it up first. I asked if he had been there. She said no. She even said if I thought so, I could write him and ask if he happened to be in that city that weekend. I said there was no need. That‚Äôs when the chain of lies began: I asked, she lied, I revealed bits of what I knew, showing her how I got the info. This lasted several days. I knew he had been there, that he met her, and that somehow they ended up traveling back on the same train. Those were some of the most stressful evenings of our lives.

At that point, I thought it was over, that the truth she admitted was enough for me. I even asked her to change her phone password and disable location sharing, so I wouldn‚Äôt have access anymore. I wanted to show I trusted her and that she didn‚Äôt need to worry I‚Äôd be watching. Fewer reasons for paranoia.

About 10 days later, we were walking around the city, drinking wine, she was showing me reels on Instagram. When she tapped Share, I accidentally saw that he was in the list of people she recently shared stuff with. We got home, I knew her Instagram password and just logged in. I opened the chat and started reading. There was a message from her: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to fall asleep with you.‚Äù He replied: ‚ÄúWe barely slept.‚Äù

My world collapsed. Everything before that meant nothing anymore. I believed so deeply that she wasn‚Äôt capable of this, that this message looked unreal to me. In that chaos, I tried to gather myself. I took a screenshot and sent it from her account to myself. Stupid decision ‚Äî I could have just confronted her, said I read the messages. But I lied, probably because I had promised earlier I wouldn‚Äôt check her phone again. That lie later destroyed a lot between us, because her trust in me also broke.

When I showed her the messages, she panicked. She claimed it was fake, that no such messages existed. I asked her to show me her account, she did ‚Äî the chat was gone. She had deleted it. We spent hours crying, talking in the worst emotional state possible. I kept asking her to explain. Eventually, after hours, she told me: he had driven her to the hotel, they went to their separate rooms. We had a call then, she sent me photos. After that, he came over, they had some food, some drinks. They sat on the bed, and from exhaustion she just dozed off for 15 minutes. He lay down next to her. When she woke up, he left.

From that evening, when I saw the messages, hell began. A hell that hasn‚Äôt ended to this day. Sometimes it was okay, I believed her. Sometimes I thought I had forgiven her. But the hell kept going.

Six months passed. We had countless destructive conversations. A lot has happened. Now I know almost everything about those days. They met every day; he picked her up after the conference, and they spent the rest of the day together. On the day of departure, he even suggested she stay until evening ‚Äî he bought tickets for both of them ‚Äî but she refused and left in the morning as planned.

Through various manipulations, I tried to get more info from her, fill in the blanks, understand one thing: did she sleep with him or not? Despite all her lies, this fact was the decisive one for me. At least, that‚Äôs what I thought back then ‚Äî maybe I still think so. We were each other‚Äôs first and only. Life happens, mistakes happen, but that step would break something invisible between us. She always insisted on one thing: yes, she lied, yes, she crossed every possible line ‚Äî but she swore she did not do *that*. She said she was honest with herself and with me about this.

And that‚Äôs what kills me. If it‚Äôs true, then I‚Äôm accusing her of something she didn‚Äôt do. If it‚Äôs a lie, then that invisible bond between us is already destroyed.

Now we‚Äôre in a terrible state. I‚Äôm serving in the army, sometimes I come home. I have constant mood swings, anxious thoughts, and stupid decisions ‚Äî like sneaking out from the unit for a day just to see her. When there‚Äôs distance between us ‚Äî it‚Äôs hell. When we‚Äôre together, even briefly ‚Äî it‚Äôs heaven. But now I came for two weeks, and all we talk about is divorce. In the evening we‚Äôre ready to separate, in the morning we want to be together. Every day is like that. Despite everything we‚Äôve been through, despite all the lies, it‚Äôs still so hard to accept that we need to split up. Emotions say one thing, reason another. My lies and manipulations were as destructive for her as her betrayal was for me. The difference is that I lied and manipulated our entire relationship, and she did it once. Though I had principles ‚Äî I never lied about things that could truly destroy us.

She says she can‚Äôt imagine life without me, and I can‚Äôt imagine mine without her. She earns enough, she could leave me anytime ‚Äî but she wants stability, wants to keep the family, wants children with me in the future. I want that too. I want my whole life with only her. And yet now, with everything that‚Äôs happened, I‚Äôm searching for reasons to leave her ‚Äî but even those aren‚Äôt enough to make me decide. Even when things are fine, some trigger comes up, and I go back to the same question: what if? And the cycle of hell starts again.

TL;DR

My wife went on a work trip, and I started noticing inconsistencies (no taxi payments, strange timings, deleted chats). I suspected she was with another man from her work. Eventually, I found Instagram messages between them (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to fall asleep with you‚Äù / ‚ÄúWe barely slept‚Äù), which crushed me. She insists they didn‚Äôt sleep together, only spent time together and crossed many boundaries.

Since then, we‚Äôve lived in a cycle of mistrust, lies, manipulations, and endless painful conversations. I‚Äôm serving in the army, and when we‚Äôre apart it feels like hell, when we‚Äôre together it feels like heaven. We swing daily between wanting divorce and wanting to stay together. We both still love each other deeply, but the betrayal (hers) and the lies (mine) have destroyed our trust. I can‚Äôt decide if I should forgive and rebuild, or finally let go.",9,1758264069.0,marriageadvice,13,1.0,False

After 30 days of omeprazole 20mg, famotidine 20mg, and sucralfate 1gm the heartburn completely went away. 

I went about a month and a half without any heartburn of stomach issues. During this entire time (and every day since may 1st) I have been eating a very strict diet (no acidic, spicy, high sugar, fried, coffee, even processed food).

A few weeks after, the heartburn came back and I saw a GI who performed a: ultrasound, upper endo, ct scan, stool sample & xrays and found nothing but some ""minor gastritis"" in my endo. 

I was put back on 20mg of omeprazole in July and since then my pain has just gotten worse and worse. About three weeks ago I finally went back to the doctor for the increasing pain and was told ""its fine nothing wrong just light gastritis... heres more (40mg) omeprazole"". 

Within the last 3 weeks on 40mg my heartburn is some how getting worse along with new symptoms like cramps in my top left abdomen that have caused me to have to lay down for hours at a time.

Has anyone else had similar experience with PPIs seemingly making symptoms worse? Any suggestions to help? I'm considering taking pepcid with my PPIs every morning again since that helped a few months ago.

This became painfully clear after an incident last week.

‚ÄãMy wife and I had planned to meet for coffee. on that day, I came down with the flu and was dealing with significant body aches after a visit to the clinic. While on the phone with her, I tried to change our plan. My logic was practical: instead of waiting for her 30 minutes at a coffee shop while feeling sick, I suggested I drive to her next train stop to pick her up.

‚ÄãThis is where I failed. I never told her I was sick.


‚ÄãFrom her perspective, I was simply flaking on our date for no good reason. She became annoyed, and because I was feeling unwell and just wanted the conversation to be over so I could go home, I didn't try to explain. I just shut down.


‚ÄãLater  day, she came home and confronted me, shouting about her disappointment. It was my second chance to communicate, and I failed again. Instead of explaining that I was sick and didn't want to wait in an uncomfortable place, I defaulted to defending myself. All I said was, ""I want to rest. I came home for peace, and I can't rest if you are shouting.""


‚Äã For the past week, she has refused to speak to me about anything other than our daughter. The tension is so obvious that last night, our daughter asked me why her mom was angry.

‚ÄãI tried to use that as an opportunity to talk to my wife this morning, but it made things worse. She told me to tell our daughter the truth (that I am lazy to not make any effort and only wanted to be a husband by title). She said that if I wouldn't, she would, ""so that our daughter gets to pick a partner that at least meets the bare minimum.""

‚Äãgut punch, that is what it felt like.

A part of me feels it's unfair. I work hard to provide them with a comfortable life, to the point where I feel I need permission to spend the money I earn. A resentful thought crosses my mind that maybe she's become so comfortable that she can afford to focus on these kinds of problems while I focus on keeping our family afloat. But I know that's an unfair assessment on my part.

‚ÄãThis situation is consuming me. I have so many responsibilities, but I can't focus because my mind is stuck on this. 

I see now that this isn't about one missed coffee date. It's the result of my consistent failure to communicate effectively. I put myself in this position.",21,1758263630.0,daddit,30,0.9,False

And we went there, me all nervous.. I came there super restless and afger a while talking, nearly going.. my mom looks at me and said youre awefully quiet today and i started crying.. so for 4 min they asked what's up and i said im trans They were a bit both shocked but dad really hit it and mom got cold and sortof pure denyal and said it doesn't do me much and stuff ... After that, we talked a bit and (details details details) There were a few things that stood out..

1. They said i never showed any girl behavior,
2. Mom thinks im just think im gay or bi,
3. Dad is scared im gettiing in burnout because im doing alot things too fast and why i diddnt wait half a year because last half year i got a own house, soon new job, living together with my bf etc (honestly dad was just concerned about me and i noticed),
4. They needed to process it (logical),
5. Mom.. doesn't accept it, simple to say.,

Sees me as a boy and thats it. Im not allowed to come to my parents with a dress or skirt. Just normal clothes. (Sure..) And a few other things, but these stuck with me the most at the moment I went home, dad brought me. We talked and hes super supportive. Just worried. And... I got home. Thats it you think Oh no there is more, In the evening, i got a few messages of mom.

1. Saying im following others desires, not mine. But my trans bf,
2. She knows sure im just gay or bi ( MOM ITS NOT SEXUALITY),
3. That im in a narcistic relationship and she ""can be wrong"" but i should otherwise break up / get out of there,
4. Again, im gay she CAN TELL AND IS usually right

The day ends, i dream about stuff.. and wake up at 3 / 4 am, because of it.  
Afterwards, at 7:30 my dad picked me up to go to work since, my work is close to his.  
Anyway.. we had a heavy talk in the car.. and its still giving me the struggles.

My dad wasnt able to sleep well.. and well he said the following :

1. Scared that im being manipulated by my trans bf  
2. that my trans  bf seems to want to break my relation with my dad, because he has a bad relationship with his own dad.  
3. THat this is not my choices.  
4. Said i wouldhave asked if you could do this wheni i died, but that could be 3 weeks or 30 years, so i couldnt ask that of you  
5. scared that i never done it before knowing my trans  bf.  
6. That my bf wants to drive me and my familly apart.  
7. And that nothing is done in the house of my bf.  
8. That we will have some serious talks about it, also with my bf  
9. that im blind following him etc and always want to talk about it with eachother

\-.-.-. And some other heavy shit that i cant talk about as i promised not to tell anyone.

Im.. im.. im unsure what to do, i want to scream but i dont know what to do.. is it my bf's fault?  
Is it becaues of him im like this? .. but i dont think so myself. but ... i am just tired already..

I will start by explaining my journey. I was a workaholic. I made good money (7 fig) but I got fatter and fatter. Until I had health issues. (Lost company, lost health)

* I tried running to lose weight, didn‚Äôt help.
* I tried eating less without working out (didn‚Äôt help).
* I tried gym workouts, proteins (didn‚Äôt help).

When I was in the hospital for 7 days, I looked at the doctor and asked what to do? He told me: get fit. I said but I don‚Äôt have time, I‚Äôve never exercised (like every day). He looked at me and said: look at yourself. That‚Äôs all he said.

Then my friend, who always knows everything, told me it is simpler than you think. Listen to me (an uneducated fool): you will lose 20kg guaranteed, just respect it for 6 months.

I said fine. I lost a couple of years trying it on my own. I will commit to 6 months. So I did.
* I ate well
* I was never hungry (only the first 5 days)
* I didn‚Äôt have a crazy workout routine

I lost 30kg just by walking.

üòµ‚Äçüí´Now you probably think how is this possible.
* walking
* eating well (only protein, little carbs ‚Äì rice, potato only) (without feeling hunger)
* counting calories (roughly, not crazy like measuring everything like fitness guys)
* fasting (basically ‚Äì only water or Coke Zero after 6)
* 1 cheat meal per week (not crazy amounts ‚Äì only after the first 2 weeks passed)

I would love to create an app for getting fit by walking, calorie counting and fasting.

If you would like to have an app like this, please sign up here: https://form.typeform.com/to/CH74PZj3

Tip:
1.	Don‚Äôt lie to yourself. If you said you will commit ‚Äì commit. If you can‚Äôt trust and rely on yourself, how can others?
2.	The first 2.5 weeks are the hardest. Later it is just a regular day and food.
3.	No sugar in any way. If you drink coffee with sugar, remove it completely from your diet. Drink espresso ‚Äì not everything in life should be sweet.

Sorry about the wait, it‚Äôs been a rough couple of days. I‚Äôve got a lot to tell you folks about.

I put my laptop and all the valuables I had in my car‚Äîwhich amounted to my wallet and an MP3 player‚Äîin the trunk, locked up my car, and walked across the street to the police station.

My heart was thumping in my throat, and my hands and face were cold even though it was nearly seventy degrees Fahrenheit.

Oddly enough I‚Äôd never been inside the Jacksonville police station, or any police station, really. It wasn‚Äôt like you see in the movies: cops in shoulder holsters bustling around a busy office, phones ringing, a tired-looking sergeant manning a desk as tall as my chin. Instead there was only a quiet lobby, a few sturdy doors, and a small receptionist window.

Nearby, the marble wall was plastered in two or three dozen sheets of A4 paper depicting men wanted for everything from fraud and theft to rape and child molestation. I went up to the little window on watery knees and knocked on it.

A woman on the other side sat at a computer typing something, her back to me.

Through a tiny hole in the window I said, ‚ÄúExcuse me. Ma‚Äôam?‚Äù

‚ÄúBe right with you.‚Äù

She clattered out a few more sentences while I stood there in the lobby. When she was done she got up and sauntered over to the window, peering up at me through the hole. It was odd that we were both doing this, seeing as how the glass was perfectly transparent. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúUmm.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure what to say. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do em, but I‚Äôd like to report a murder. ‚ÄîSeveral murders.‚Äù

*‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù* The receptionist recoiled.

‚ÄúSome friends of mine. Another friend is going around killing us because we made him put on a bear suit.‚Äù

She stared at me for a long time.

‚ÄúSon, if this is a joke, it‚Äôs in very bad taste.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo joke, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you call 911 or something?‚Äù she demanded angrily, like I‚Äôd breached some kind of protocol and, goddammit, she was going to have to do something too much like work now.

To be honest it hadn‚Äôt even occurred to me, and I told her so. ‚ÄúBesides, somebody, uhh‚Ä¶well, a guy that‚Äôs seen this kind of thing before? I think? He told me to come straight here and have you lock me up so I‚Äôd be safe. I think he‚Äôs gone to take care of it. The killer guy killed his wife. I think she came here to kill the killer, but the killer killed her, so the guy that usually kills the killer is here to kill him again. ‚Ä¶Well, I hope he‚Äôs not, anyway, because the killer is a good friend of mine,‚Äù I said, and immediately regretted it.

The receptionist turned and trundled out of the little office.

A few minutes later, the door next to the window buzzed like a wrong answer on a game-show and a heavy clunk told me the door was unlocked. The receptionist‚Äôs voice came from the hole over in the window: ‚ÄúGet on in here.‚Äù I pulled the door open and went inside.

Beyond the door was a long hallway, a dozen doors leading into a dozen rooms. I didn‚Äôt get to dwell on it because there was a cop standing beside me as the door eased shut, a big ol slab of white guy in full uniform. His chest was thick with bulletproof vest, as if he had a pillow in his shirt.

My hands went up alongside my face as if I were about to play peekaboo. ‚ÄúNow what the shit is this about murders?‚Äù asked the cop, his face six inches from mine, fogging me with coffee breath. He sidled between me and the door I‚Äôd just come through.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to search me or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I need to?‚Äù he asked, his elbows out, his thumbs in the back of his patrol belt. I tried not to look at his weapons.

‚ÄúNo?‚Äù

A man in a dress shirt and a tie walked from one door into another, carrying a manila folder. I could hear the bored buzzing and ticking of a copier.

‚ÄúGround control to Major Tom,‚Äù said the cop.

I rubbed my eye. Suddenly I felt like lying down and taking a long nap. ‚ÄúLook, this is a long story, and I can‚Äôt promise you‚Äôre going to believe all of it, but none of it is bullshit.‚Äù I took a deep breath. ‚ÄúMe and my friends bought a bear costume on Craigslist for my friend Dylan to wear to the convention in Oxford this weekend, but it turns out that the suit is haunted by an 18th century French fur-trapper and now Dylan‚Äôs possessed and he‚Äôs going around killing.

‚ÄúThere are‚Äî‚Äù I glanced at the wall over the cop‚Äôs shoulder and tallied up names. ‚Äú‚ÄîFive people dead so far. Two of them are up on the lookout point right now. And there are two down in Roanoke, if nobody‚Äôs found em yet. And my friend Steven in his apartment the other day, but Anniston police knows about them.‚Äù

The cop stared at me like the receptionist had.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a joke, sir,‚Äù I said as earnestly as I could manage.

‚ÄúCollege kids.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúAre you high?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go to JSU, sir. I don‚Äôt smoke or do drugs, either. I don‚Äôt even drink.‚Äù

He looked around, peered down the hallway. ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù he said with a jerk of his head, and he led me into a nearby conference room.

A long pressboard table dominated the room, scarred by years of bored cops. ‚ÄúSit down.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt direct me to a specific chair, so I went to the back of the room and sat at the head of the table with my back to the wall.

‚ÄúI swear to God I‚Äôm not high.""

""Shut up.""

""And this isn‚Äôt a joke. He‚Äôs already killed five people and he‚Äôs gonna kill me if I don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShut your mouth.‚Äù He said it mildly, biting his lower lip. Without another word, he knocked once on the table as if to subliminally nail me to the spot and left.

Radio chatter gargled from another room. A projector sat on the table in front of me, waiting to beam a Powerpoint presentation onto the white screen hanging by the door.

*Shit,* I thought. *Greg is using Jacob for bait, isn‚Äôt he? And that‚Äôs all going to go down while I‚Äôm sitting here at the freaking police station.* Regret began to sink in. I had made the wrong choice. Should have gone straight to Jacob‚Äôs vet clinic and got him out of there. I got up and went to the door, but the doorknob wouldn‚Äôt turn. *Locked in. Damn. What now?*

While I was pondering it, the door opened and the cop came back in, followed by the guy I‚Äôd seen outside with the folder.

Folder Guy was like a soft-spoken version of Dr. Phil, and radiated a sort of trapped energy that made him look as if he were perpetually about to throw a punch. He dropped the folder on the table. ‚ÄúI hear you‚Äôve got a hell of a story to tell, buddy.‚Äù

Dr. Phil was standing way too deep into my personal bubble. I sat back down in my chair, but before I did I caught the nametag on his shirt: DET. AVERY.

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you know who‚Äôs responsible for the one in Anniston. Steven Maines, I think his name is.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. He was my friend.‚Äù

Detective Avery wiped at the corners of his mouth, pulling it into an O. ‚ÄúYou say this is all the work of a psychopath in a haunted bunny suit?‚Äù

‚ÄúBear suit. Sir. Possessed by a spirit.‚Äù

‚ÄúA very angry one, judging by the job he did on your friend Steve.‚Äù

My heart sank until it was right up against my stomach. Avery‚Äôs eyes burned into my face until I had to look away‚Äîwas like staring into the sun. Finally he picked his folder back up and opened the door. ‚ÄúCome with me, I have something you ought to see.‚Äù

This sounded important. The patrolman stayed in the conference room while Avery led me down the hallway and around the corner to the door at the end.

Behind that door was a small room with another desk clerk, a uniformed officer with a ledger sitting on the other side of a desk counter, staring at a computer screen. He glanced at Avery; there was another wrong-answer buzzer and a nearby door unlocked with a thunk.

Avery opened it and ushered me through into a hallway of naked cinderblock. Around another corner was the precinct lockup, four large cells, no cots or toilets. All the cells were empty.

He slid the door open on the first cell he came to and shoved me inside, closing the door behind me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like you to sit tight here and take a break while we send somebody up to check out your little tall tale. If it turns out you‚Äôre just flyin high, this‚Äôll make a pretty good spot for you to sober up. I‚Äôll come back and talk to you in a little while.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶is actually what I came here for, detective,‚Äù I said, feeling oddly like I‚Äôd accidentally tricked him into doing what I wanted. ‚ÄúThank you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a smartass,‚Äù said the detective, and he left.

Seemed like the perfect time to sit and brainstorm a way of dealing with Dylan if whatever Greg was cooking up didn‚Äôt pan out. I sat on the bench in the back of the cell and thought about the comments I‚Äôd been seeing on my posts to Reddit.com‚Äîburning the bear-suit off with acid, stopping Dylan‚Äôs heart so the suit would think he was dead and come loose.

How could I stop his heart in a way that wouldn‚Äôt leave him permanently injured, a way that would let me bring him back after we got the suit off? He took a shot and a half of industrial-strength ketamine and brushed it off. I didn‚Äôt have access to that anymore anyway, and who knows what Ashleigh did with the stungun?

We could electrocute him, maybe. Let him walk into a puddle of water and throw a power cord into it. But that might kill him hard enough that I couldn‚Äôt bring him back.

Hmm‚Ä¶water.

A couple of hours later, Avery came back with two patrolmen. The detective leaned against the bars with one foot kicked up like an old cowboy resting on a ranch fence. One of his friends was the guy I‚Äôd spoken to when I first got here. He stood behind Avery with his thumbs tucked into his belt again.

The other officer had his back against the bars on the other side of the corridor, texting someone on his cellphone. He looked distracted, but he kept shooting me cold glances. Multitasking.

‚ÄúY‚Äôall think I did it, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù I asked Avery.

‚ÄúRight now I don‚Äôt know what to think.‚Äù His words said helpless confusion, but his tone was more exasperation and accusation.

‚ÄúYou do think I did it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, that ain‚Äôt what I‚Äôm saying, son.‚Äù He fetched a heavy sigh. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name? Mine‚Äôs Mike Avery.‚Äù

‚ÄúCody Garner.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike I said, there ain‚Äôt nobody sayin what‚Äôs what right now. All I know is that I got two dead folks up on the mountain and a fella says the man that did it is possessed by the devil.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot the devil, an 18th century French fur-trapper.‚Äù

*‚ÄúWhat-the-hell-ever!‚Äù* blurted the cop typing on his phone, scowling. He looked like he was the same age as me.

Avery eyed him over his shoulder and turned back to me. ‚ÄúI guess I have to admit, it don‚Äôt sound good after all. I do want to ask you, why you didn‚Äôt call the po-lice‚Äî‚Äù *Poh-leese,* he said, glancing at the floor as he said it, ‚Äú‚Äîwhen you found those folks down in Roanoke? Why‚Äôd you run off and keep it to yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I was there when it happened. I saw the bear-suit make Dylan kill both of em. I just wanted to get the hell out of there before he gave me some of their medicine too.‚Äù I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúGuess I was just so shook up‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt think you would believe me, or you would think I did it‚Äîthat all I could think of was to go straight to Ashleigh‚Äôs house to make sure she was okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis Ashleigh, is she your girlfriend?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, she wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was killed up on the mountain.‚Äù

The big blond cop handed Warner a card that looked like a driver‚Äôs license. Warner took it and glanced at it, then slipped it into his shirt pocket. ‚ÄúSon, what I‚Äôm seeing here is some kind of love triangle that went real south, real fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I was aghast.

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre trying to blame it on some phantom maniac. I think you and this Steven fella were butting heads over this Ashleigh girl and when you lost your cool, the whole thing blew up in your face. What I don‚Äôt understand is what the Sumralls had to do with it.‚Äù

This deduction was so ludicrous I almost laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out of your mind, fool,‚Äù I said, my anger making me bold. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt kill people. I put books in alphabetical order and scoop dirty magazines out of toilets.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a pervert that dresses up like an animal to get your rocks off with your fellow perverts, is what you are,‚Äù said Phone Cop. ‚ÄúWas that not enough, that you need to kill now, to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShane,‚Äù said Detective Avery, his dry country accent turning cold. ‚ÄúGo see if Debbie has any trash that needs took out.‚Äù Shane recoiled in indignation at being ordered around, but he left, jamming his phone into his trouser pocket.

‚ÄúThis crazy-ass love triangle story you‚Äôve dreamed up is some truly sketchy garbage,‚Äù I told Detective Avery. ‚ÄúYou go to the vet clinic where Jacob Preston works. Greg Sumrall should be there. I think Greg is using Jacob as bait to catch Dylan and kill him to get the bear suit off.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Garner, I‚Äôm gonna need you to be straight with me and quit it with this bullshit bear-suit story.‚Äù

*Say that three times fast.*

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I said finally, getting up off the cot and wrapping my own hands around the bars. My face was inches from Avery‚Äôs, which prompted the bigger patrolman to step forward. This close I could see his nametag: SGT. BENTLEY. ‚ÄúThis is all getting a little too meta for me. Surely you‚Äôve watched enough horror movies to know you‚Äôre doing the same thing all those asshole skeptics in those kinds of movies do. Yeah, I know what I‚Äôm telling you is a little hard to grasp, but I‚Äôll bet you dime to a dollar that Bear Kills is gonna come walkin in here any minute with a fucking axe to convince you I‚Äôm *not* full of crap.‚Äù

A smile teased the corner of Avery‚Äôs mouth.

‚ÄúSo if you don‚Äôt have anything to charge me with,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúlet me out so I can go make sure Sumrall hasn‚Äôt gotten my friend killed.‚Äù

‚ÄúBuddy, real life ain‚Äôt like these horror movies you keep talkin about,‚Äù said Avery. He backed up off the bars and stuck his hands in his slacks pockets, jingling change. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre bein held on suspicion, there ain‚Äôt shit you can demand from me or this man standing here for seventy-two hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúBachelors‚Äô in criminal justice, motherfucker!‚Äù Sgt. Bentley made heavy metal devil-horns with his hands, crossing his arms over his chest. ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt as smart as you think you are!‚Äù

He was wagging his tongue at me when the lights went out, blinding all three of us. The A/C died with a death rattle.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd I tell you?‚Äù I said angrily into the darkness.

Bentley and Avery stood motionless in front of me, listening. I heard the detective‚Äôs leather shoes creak.

With a hard *clack!,* the emergency lights came on, humming like live wires. Yellow beacons on the walls turned what was once a cold cellblock into an aquarium full of piss, a sick honey-colored slaughterhouse.

The detective stared at me as if I was responsible, and gradually I could smell burning dust from the beacons.

Finally he turned to the sergeant standing next to him. ‚ÄúGo check the breaker box.‚Äù

Bentley unlocked my cell, came in with me, and shut the door in Avery‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúFuuuuuuuuck *that* noise.‚Äù

Avery shook his head in astonishment. ‚ÄúYou want me to do your job for you? Fine. I‚Äôll go get Shane and make him do it. I hope you were pulling for a week off with no pay, Sergeant Vagina.‚Äù

With that, he turned and walked out of the cellblock.

‚ÄúWhat about your criminal justice degree?‚Äù I asked Bentley, peering through the bilious yellow haze. The lights made him look like a Simpsons character.

‚ÄúThe graveyards are full of people with degrees.‚Äù

I snorted and sat down on the bench again.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I believe this goofy-ass crap you were saying about a‚Äî‚Äù he snorted in disbelief, ‚Äúpossessed bear costume. That you‚Äôre not blowing smoke up our asses. What were you planning on doing about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, my original plan was to come here, let you lock me up to keep me safe, and let that Greg guy deal with it.‚Äù I told him about how the Sumralls had been using the suit as a scam‚Äîselling it to unsuspecting people, waiting for it to kill all the witnesses, then killing the host and taking the suit back.

I also told him about how Eric‚Äôs mother had gotten stuck in the suit and they‚Äôd had to blow her brains out. ‚ÄúI get the feeling Greg was the younger brother that moved away and didn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt either, if all that about their mother is true.‚Äù Bentley made a face. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs some rough shit. If it's true.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut after I realized he was using my friend Jacob as bait, I decided I needed to get out of here and go after him myself. I had a plan beyond that, if it‚Äôll work. If I can do it. If he doesn‚Äôt kill me when I try it.‚Äù

Bentley leaned against the bars, peering down the hallway at an angle. ‚ÄúGoddamn it. I‚Äôm going to have to go check on Avery, ain‚Äôt I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll stay in this cell if you know what‚Äôs good for you.‚Äù

He sighed, scowling back at me, and unlocked the cell, letting himself out. He shut the door again, locking it. ‚ÄúYou stay your ass in here,‚Äù he told me, tossing me the keys. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come out unless I tell you to.‚Äù

I nodded. He strode off toward the front of the building, and just before the block door thudded shut I heard the slurp of his pistol coming out of his holster. The next few minutes were agony, sitting in yellow shadows, waiting for the cop to come back.

For lack of anything else to do, I stared at my hands and found them trembling. Suddenly they looked like a little boy‚Äôs hands‚Äîsoft, thin, graceless. Inept.

‚ÄúWhat the shit is going on?‚Äù The cellblock sergeant. He‚Äôd gotten up from behind his little counter and was peering through the half-open door.

‚ÄúYou need to get in here with me,‚Äù I told him.

He said nothing, just gave me a weird look and shut the door.

The silence stretched into ten, fifteen minutes. Then I heard the first of the gunshots: a paper-bag *pop!,* muffled by a half-dozen brick walls. It was followed by two more, then another interminable stretch of electric silence.

‚ÄúBentley?‚Äù I shouted into the yellow quiet. ‚ÄúAvery?‚Äù

The wrong-answer buzzer again, and the door flew open. Bentley at a full run. He wriggled through the door and ran to the cell, fumbling his keys out. ‚ÄúShit shit shit *shit shit shit.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I asked him.

The block sergeant followed him into the cellblock, waddling awkwardly as if he had some kind of old war wound‚Äîprobably a Desert Storm veteran. The front door eased shut behind him on a hydraulic piston as he came in. ‚ÄúHey, Bent, you gonna tell me what the hell is going on, or I got to guess?‚Äù

Bentley unlocked my cell and got in with me, waving the block sergeant in. ‚ÄúGet your ass in here, Thomas‚Äî‚Äù

A red blade slipped through the gap in the block door, and the door closed on it.

*‚Äú*‚Äî*Get in here now!‚Äù*

‚ÄúThe hell?‚Äù asked the block sergeant.

Dylan pulled the door open and lunged into the cellblock, bringing the machete down on the back of the sergeant‚Äôs head.

Thomas‚Äôs eyes bulged outward like some kind of morbid Muppet, blood squirted out of his nose, and he pitched forward onto his belly. Bentley slammed the cell door and backed away from it. The bear-man snatched his machete out of the dead cop‚Äôs skull and walked toward us.

Dylan stood in front of the cell staring at us, his shoulders heaving up and down with every breath.

He looked even more disheveled than before, the bear‚Äôs fur napped up in whorls and curls with dried blood, like a teddy bear that had been through a washing machine full of wine. The stubby fingers of Dylan‚Äôs naked right hand were so tight on the machete-handle his knuckles were white spikes.

The smell of shit and pennies floated into the cell. I got the feeling Dylan Gilchrist had fouled his sweatpants inside the inescapable bear suit.

Funny how things like that come full circle, ain‚Äôt it?

‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Äî?‚Äù wheezed Bentley. *‚ÄúWhat the fuck what the fuck?‚Äù*

‚ÄúI told you!‚Äù I shouted, throwing an open hand to the fuming killer: Ta-da! Voila! Presto! Here he is, he was under the sheet the whole time. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt get us in here. We‚Äôre safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI shot him three times.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the bear suit. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶bullet-resistant. Or maybe they‚Äôre going in but the suit‚Äôs keeping him on his feet. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs a long story.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say he was a fur-trapper?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fur-trappers shoot game with guns?‚Äù

Dylan continued to pant like a slavering horse, watching us. Abruptly, I understood why Bentley was concerned‚ÄîThomas‚Äôs corpse still had his service weapon holstered in it. All Dylan had to do was pivot, pull out Thomas‚Äôs gun, and shoot the both of us.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I offered. ‚ÄúDid they have guns in the 1700s?‚Äù

‚ÄúHad em in the 1800s, I know. Civil War and shit. Muzzle loaders, maybe? Would he even understand a modern gun?‚Äù

‚ÄúHell if I know.‚Äù

The bear-man‚Äôs left claw rose up and curled around one of the bars in the cell door. Bracing himself, Dylan shook the bars ferociously and growled something in French, a guttural string of nonsense filtered through layers of hair and leather.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he saying?‚Äù asked Bentley.

‚ÄúHow the hell should I know? Do I look French to you?‚Äù

Something was weird about the cell door. The more Dylan shook it, the more I noticed it, until it finally hit me. The bear-man paused, looking at the gap between the door and the wall. Bentley had slammed the cell door, but it had bounced out of the latch a half-inch without locking.

The door was still ajar.

Both of us choked as Dylan wrenched it to the side, throwing it open.

Bentley scuttled backward, pressing himself against the wall next to me. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he hissed, and drew his pistol, firing into Dylan‚Äôs chest.

Just like the locker room of the Roanoke church, the gunshots whacked painfully through my skull, noise bouncing around the concrete floor and walls like a brass pinball.

Dylan shook with each shot, staggering back into the corridor.

As soon as the pistol‚Äôs slide racked back on an empty chamber and caught, Bentley threw it down and grabbed the cell door with every intention of slamming it shut again. The instant Bentley‚Äôs fingers slipped through the bars, Dylan whacked one of his hands with the machete.

The cop screamed and flinched away, scrambling, almost falling. Blood watercolored the floor between his shoes.

Surging toward the open door, the mad spirit of Ga√©tan Delacroix raised the machete to bring it down on my forehead‚Äîbut as he stepped into the cell, a shape came up behind him and pointed a TV remote at his back. The tip cracked open like a party popper and blew a handful of glitter and confetti all over the cell.

The bear-man seized up and his knees buckled. *‚ÄúGRRRAAAAGH!‚Äù* he screamed, dropping onto his back and jittering like an epileptic.

Detective Avery stood over him, holding an expended Taser.

‚ÄúSweet Jesus, I thought you were fucking dead,‚Äù said Bentley, picking up his pistol and holstering it. He cradled his wounded hand against his chest, blood running into his sleeve. Dylan had cut him deeply in the webbing between his index and middle finger. ‚ÄúWhere did you go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was in the utility room trying to find a new fuse.‚Äù Detective Avery kicked the machete out of Dylan‚Äôs hand and grabbed two handfuls of bear fur, rolling him over. He took out a pair of handcuffs, then seemed to realize that the left cuff wasn‚Äôt going to fit over the costume‚Äôs sleeve.

Bentley pulled a zip-tie out of his shirt pauldron and straddled the incapacitated bear, pulling his hands behind his back.

The three of us stood there, staring down at the bear-man.

‚ÄúNow what?‚Äù asked Bentley.

As he spoke, Avery went around and grabbed the bear-suit‚Äôs ears, trying to wrench the head off, but it was still attached to Dylan. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say you had a plan?‚Äù

My memory failed me for a few seconds, but then it came back to me‚Äîthe convention hotel. We had to take him to the hotel where we‚Äôd gone to OxFurred. They had what I needed.

I picked up Dylan‚Äôs feet. ‚ÄúHelp me get him into a car.‚Äù",1,1758263424.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

/Backstory: Simon Frowl was born in Detroit, Michigan, a city already gutted by economic collapse long before the Omnic Crisis reduced it to a husk of steel and silence. Entire neighborhoods were abandoned, factories stood hollow, and the wreckage of half-dismantled omnics lay rusting in the streets. For Simon, this wasn‚Äôt a wasteland, it was a playground. He grew up crawling through scrapyards, scavenging broken tech, and finding joy in coaxing life back into dead machines. His parents were factory workers turned scavengers, scraping by on odd salvage and barter. They loved him, but survival was unforgiving. A collapsed building took his mother when he was nine, and his father, grief-stricken, disappeared into the dangerous work of smuggling and never returned. Left alone, Simon clung to what he had always known: inventing. He made heaters out of rusted coils, repaired broken radios, and crafted sparks of wonder out of things others had thrown away. But Detroit had no patience for dreamers. Crews and gangs took advantage of his talents, exploiting his knack for rigging traps, bypassing locks, or cobbling weapons from junk. Yet Simon was never cruel, he laughed, joked, and slipped away whenever the weight of violence pressed too close. Still, the streets wore him thin, leaving him a drifter with soot on his face, sparks in his hands, and nowhere to belong. That wandering eventually carried him far beyond Detroit, through freight yards, border towns, and forgotten rails, until he crossed the ocean on a smuggler‚Äôs ship and stumbled into Junkertown. Among scavengers and outlaws, his chaos wasn‚Äôt a weakness but rather, it was a language. Here, tech cobbled from wreckage was celebrated, and wild ideas weren‚Äôt silenced but instead left some in awe, fear, or just a place to get drunk. Simon, for the first time, felt like he wasn‚Äôt the only broken thing still trying to work. Though his past is littered with loss, Simon carries a strange, defiant hope. To him, tragedy isn‚Äôt final. Every collapse, every abandoned machine, every scar is proof that something can be rebuilt. Not into what it was, but into something new. His life is proof of it: a boy born in ruins, still laughing, still inventing, still daring to believe that broken things can shine.

 Personality: Simon Frowl‚Äôs mind is a pinball machine of sparks and magnets; brilliant, erratic, and impossible to contain. He talked fast, moved faster, and never said ‚Äúno‚Äù to a terrible idea if it sounded funny enough. To him, stillness feels like suffocation, silence like static. He thrives in motion, in tinkering, in tearing things apart just to see if he can rebuild them differently. If you asked him a question, he might respond with a 10-minute rant about the conductivity of chewing gum wrappers before giving you the answer, if at all. Conversations with Simon rarely follow straight lines; they ricochet, spiral, and double back, much like the inventions he cobbles together. He treats strangers like old friends, barreling past boundaries with a kind of careless warmth that can be as disarming as it is overwhelming. Yet beneath the chaos lies a core that defies easy labels. He was once written off as ‚Äútoo unpredictable, too unserious, and also, did he just try to hotwire the training drone to dance?‚Äù But those who dismiss him miss the truth: Simon‚Äôs laughter is not recklessness, but rebellion. He refuses to let the world‚Äôs weight smother him. His care is not spoken in words, but built into every strange contraption he gifts, every broken thing he makes sing again. Messy, scattered, and endlessly inventive, Simon Frowl is less a man of order than a force of momentum. He is proof that hope doesn‚Äôt always arrive polished or precise but rather that sometimes it comes in sparks, duct tape, and a laugh echoing through the ruins.

I've been watching a lot of JOLLY come up on my feed as they traverse America and bring American food to Brits or enjoy American cuisine. One thing I've noticed is that ""American"" breakfast as thought about by non-americans is not what most of us eat on a daily basis. We might eat some eggs and bacon or a pastry and coffee occasionally through the week. I feel media makes you think we have a giant spread full of sugar on a daily basis. Kids do eat a lot of sugar laced cereal, but the breakfast, as seen in the media, is far from that for average adults on a regular basis. We eat that at most on a weekend that we want to go to a diner and have pancakes or a waffle with bacon or sausage. My question is, how often are you getting a full English breakfast? Not just some beans on toast or a croissant and coffee. I also have no idea how often you are eating beans on toast.",0,1758263188.0,AskUK,102,0.5,False

/Backstory: Simon Frowl was born in Detroit, Michigan, a city already gutted by economic collapse long before the Omnic Crisis reduced it to a husk of steel and silence. Entire neighborhoods were abandoned, factories stood hollow, and the wreckage of half-dismantled omnics lay rusting in the streets. For Simon, this wasn‚Äôt a wasteland, it was a playground. He grew up crawling through scrapyards, scavenging broken tech, and finding joy in coaxing life back into dead machines. His parents were factory workers turned scavengers, scraping by on odd salvage and barter. They loved him, but survival was unforgiving. A collapsed building took his mother when he was nine, and his father, grief-stricken, disappeared into the dangerous work of smuggling and never returned. Left alone, Simon clung to what he had always known: inventing. He made heaters out of rusted coils, repaired broken radios, and crafted sparks of wonder out of things others had thrown away. But Detroit had no patience for dreamers. Crews and gangs took advantage of his talents, exploiting his knack for rigging traps, bypassing locks, or cobbling weapons from junk. Yet Simon was never cruel, he laughed, joked, and slipped away whenever the weight of violence pressed too close. Still, the streets wore him thin, leaving him a drifter with soot on his face, sparks in his hands, and nowhere to belong. That wandering eventually carried him far beyond Detroit, through freight yards, border towns, and forgotten rails, until he crossed the ocean on a smuggler‚Äôs ship and stumbled into Junkertown. Among scavengers and outlaws, his chaos wasn‚Äôt a weakness but rather, it was a language. Here, tech cobbled from wreckage was celebrated, and wild ideas weren‚Äôt silenced but instead left some in awe, fear, or just a place to get drunk. Simon, for the first time, felt like he wasn‚Äôt the only broken thing still trying to work. Though his past is littered with loss, Simon carries a strange, defiant hope. To him, tragedy isn‚Äôt final. Every collapse, every abandoned machine, every scar is proof that something can be rebuilt. Not into what it was, but into something new. His life is proof of it: a boy born in ruins, still laughing, still inventing, still daring to believe that broken things can shine.

Personality: Simon Frowl‚Äôs mind is a pinball machine of sparks and magnets; brilliant, erratic, and impossible to contain. He talked fast, moved faster, and never said ‚Äúno‚Äù to a terrible idea if it sounded funny enough. To him, stillness feels like suffocation, silence like static. He thrives in motion, in tinkering, in tearing things apart just to see if he can rebuild them differently. If you asked him a question, he might respond with a 10-minute rant about the conductivity of chewing gum wrappers before giving you the answer, if at all. Conversations with Simon rarely follow straight lines; they ricochet, spiral, and double back, much like the inventions he cobbles together. He treats strangers like old friends, barreling past boundaries with a kind of careless warmth that can be as disarming as it is overwhelming. Yet beneath the chaos lies a core that defies easy labels. He was once written off as ‚Äútoo unpredictable, too unserious, and also, did he just try to hotwire the training drone to dance?‚Äù But those who dismiss him miss the truth: Simon‚Äôs laughter is not recklessness, but rebellion. He refuses to let the world‚Äôs weight smother him. His care is not spoken in words, but built into every strange contraption he gifts, every broken thing he makes sing again. Messy, scattered, and endlessly inventive, Simon Frowl is less a man of order than a force of momentum. He is proof that hope doesn‚Äôt always arrive polished or precise but rather that sometimes it comes in sparks, duct tape, and a laugh echoing through the ruins.

/Backstory: Simon Frowl was born in Detroit, Michigan, a city already gutted by economic collapse long before the Omnic Crisis reduced it to a husk of steel and silence. Entire neighborhoods were abandoned, factories stood hollow, and the wreckage of half-dismantled omnics lay rusting in the streets. For Simon, this wasn‚Äôt a wasteland, it was a playground. He grew up crawling through scrapyards, scavenging broken tech, and finding joy in coaxing life back into dead machines. His parents were factory workers turned scavengers, scraping by on odd salvage and barter. They loved him, but survival was unforgiving. A collapsed building took his mother when he was nine, and his father, grief-stricken, disappeared into the dangerous work of smuggling and never returned. Left alone, Simon clung to what he had always known: inventing. He made heaters out of rusted coils, repaired broken radios, and crafted sparks of wonder out of things others had thrown away. But Detroit had no patience for dreamers. Crews and gangs took advantage of his talents, exploiting his knack for rigging traps, bypassing locks, or cobbling weapons from junk. Yet Simon was never cruel, he laughed, joked, and slipped away whenever the weight of violence pressed too close. Still, the streets wore him thin, leaving him a drifter with soot on his face, sparks in his hands, and nowhere to belong. That wandering eventually carried him far beyond Detroit, through freight yards, border towns, and forgotten rails, until he crossed the ocean on a smuggler‚Äôs ship and stumbled into Junkertown. Among scavengers and outlaws, his chaos wasn‚Äôt a weakness but rather, it was a language. Here, tech cobbled from wreckage was celebrated, and wild ideas weren‚Äôt silenced but instead left some in awe, fear, or just a place to get drunk. Simon, for the first time, felt like he wasn‚Äôt the only broken thing still trying to work. Though his past is littered with loss, Simon carries a strange, defiant hope. To him, tragedy isn‚Äôt final. Every collapse, every abandoned machine, every scar is proof that something can be rebuilt. Not into what it was, but into something new. His life is proof of it: a boy born in ruins, still laughing, still inventing, still daring to believe that broken things can shine.  
Personality: Simon Frowl‚Äôs mind is a pinball machine of sparks and magnets; brilliant, erratic, and impossible to contain. He talked fast, moved faster, and never said ‚Äúno‚Äù to a terrible idea if it sounded funny enough. To him, stillness feels like suffocation, silence like static. He thrives in motion, in tinkering, in tearing things apart just to see if he can rebuild them differently. If you asked him a question, he might respond with a 10-minute rant about the conductivity of chewing gum wrappers before giving you the answer, if at all. Conversations with Simon rarely follow straight lines; they ricochet, spiral, and double back, much like the inventions he cobbles together. He treats strangers like old friends, barreling past boundaries with a kind of careless warmth that can be as disarming as it is overwhelming. Yet beneath the chaos lies a core that defies easy labels. He was once written off as ‚Äútoo unpredictable, too unserious, and also, did he just try to hotwire the training drone to dance?‚Äù But those who dismiss him miss the truth: Simon‚Äôs laughter is not recklessness, but rebellion. He refuses to let the world‚Äôs weight smother him. His care is not spoken in words, but built into every strange contraption he gifts, every broken thing he makes sing again. Messy, scattered, and endlessly inventive, Simon Frowl is less a man of order than a force of momentum. He is proof that hope doesn‚Äôt always arrive polished or precise but rather that sometimes it comes in sparks, duct tape, and a laugh echoing through the ruins.

**1. initial excitement**  
late nights, endless coffee, dreaming about your idea turning into the next big thing.

**2. launch day anxiety**  
you hit¬†**publish**¬†and wonder:¬†*who will care?*  
the answer: almost nobody.

**3. disappointment**  
silence. no one shows up. motivation crashes.

**4. chasing gurus**  
you start following people on x, reddit, youtube. you think:¬†*‚Äúah, i need to build in public.‚Äù*¬†you start posting completed features as if you just shipped them. still‚Ä¶ nobody cares.

**5. first spark of life**  
one day, someone actually notices. they say they love what you‚Äôve done. your hope comes back.

**6. brutal reality check**  
you show them all your exciting features. they say:¬†*‚Äúi only need this one simple workflow.‚Äù*  
that‚Äôs the wake-up call. you finally see what really matters.

**7. real focus**  
you turn your marketing + product toward that single workflow. things start working. new users come.

**8. the ego kill**  
your ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù features? cut. your health? suffering. family life? downgraded. you realize being a founder tests everything: patience, adaptability, humility.

**9. small wins, shaky hope**  
you post MRR milestones. some get attention, some flop. but little by little, progress compounds.

**10. breakthrough**  
after months of stress and doubt, you finally see traction. not huge, but real.

and through it all, you learn: consistency > hype.  
if you survive the ugly parts, you come out tougher. maybe even unbeatable.

Hi! I'm trying this again üòÖ 

**The relationship I'm looking for:**
* friendship to dating to marry/exclusive LTR with similar non-sexual & sexual interests. If you don't see yourself commiting to an exclusive long term relationship yet then maybe we won't match. This will be like online dating since we will get to know each other. If you are just looking for a quick sexting, you won't get it with me.
* online to in real life meet up. Preferably you live close to my timezone (more or less 1 to 5 hrs time difference, ex. Aus, NZ, SG, JP, KR, etc) so if ever we can travel to meet. Just wanna put it out there that I don't have any plans to travel/relocate to the other side of the world.
* Semi- FLR relationship - just like how Link treats Zelda and vice versa. You'll be my loyal knight & I'll look after you. We protect each other. I see FLR in our daily lives & decision making but away from our careers. Also, not purely focusing on sexual interests. Hope to discuss this further in chat :) 

**Get to know me:**
* 29 F, 152cm, single, chubby | plus-size, Asian, brown eyes, and currently have black hair
* living in Asia (GMT +8) 
* I have little scars all over my body (from pets, work, & clumsiness, nothing major and not due to bdsm/kinks. You can just see them more if you look closely & since I have light skin.)
* gentle domme switch - I do have times where I prefer to be a sub too
* strong personality, introvert, big texter, straightforward, clingy, committed 
* focused on my career
* some interests I have: caring for dogs & cats, gaming (currently playing Zelda totk), just got into F1, coffee, exercising, flowers 

**The person I'm looking for:**
* 23 to 35 
* must be single male & is looking for friendship to date to marry (if you are in a poly relationship, married, or taken, please don't message me.)
* preferably close with my timezone (more or less 1 to 5hrs time difference). Open to other timezones but note that I don't have any plans to relocate or travel to the other side of the world :) 
* service top sub or switch | looking for my knight 
* someone who loves/ open to plus-size body types 
* hygienic & patience (I'm a bit insecure so hopefully you are patient with me)
* non-smoker & ddf
* preferred (not required): taller & bigger than me | 5'8 and above with a muscular/ rugby body
* consistent in both texting and in real life conversations. You can tell me all about your hobbies, I like listening to what you love.
* emotionally intelligent 
* stable career or on the road to it. Since this is for long term, I want us also focused on our career for our future. 

**NSFW**
* I'm into facesitting, cunnilingus/ oral, shibari, sensory play (blindfolds, cuffs, and leashes)
* not into open/poly, findom, sissification, illegal, blood, scating, drugs, smokers, ageplay roleplay 

**If you will message me,**
* don't jump into sexting or sending me nsfw pics, please.
* don't jump into a dynamic meaning don't call me mistress, mommy, etc immediately 
* have the intention of wanting to be friends with me/ get to know me first before moving on to a relationship
* committed to this connection. Know that I will only be talking to you only and I hope you are the same.
* know that I like daily consistent texting to build the friendship so hopefully you can give me that. 

**Read everything & still would like to message me? Kindly include in your initial message:**
* age, sex, location, physical description (hair, body, eyes, height, etc, whatever you want. Just wanna picture you in my head)
* what hobbies do you have
* why me? Why my post?
* fave cartoon 

I do appreciate a more meaningful message rather than just a one liner. **Also, no lying. I hate liars** :) 

No hard feelings: I will only reply to the user that I feel will match with me. It will also take me a bit more time to check each message since I'm currently traveling :)
