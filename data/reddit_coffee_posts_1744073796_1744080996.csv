1ju3l7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1ju3l7m/aita_for_apologizing_to_my_husband_45m_when_i32f/,AITA for apologizing to my husband (45M) when I(32F) am in the wrong?,"I know the title seems obvious but hear me out.

My husband (45M) and I (32F) have been together for 3 years, married for about a year and half. He has a lot of trust issues mostly because of his mother being very manipulative, and also a few bad relationships prior.

I have worked very hard to be patient and gentle and understanding of his traumas (of which he has many). And most of the time he is an AMAZING husband and he's loving and kind.

But a lot of the time when we have a disagreement and I am in the wrong, and I take ownership of that and apologize and promise him I will do better in the future, it just makes him more angry and he dismisses it as ""fake"" and ""manipulative"" and thinks I'm somehow trying to make him feel guilty.

Quick example: we have a coffee trailer and the fridge in it broke this past weekend. So I took it out to get serviced and bought a fairly cheap replacement fridge to use in the meantime. He absolutely flew off the handle because he saw it as a waste of money and that it's a ""cheap shitty fridge that'll break soon too"" and it's important to get good refrigeration to make sure we don't get anyone sick. I agreed with him that he was right and I shouldn't risk a cheap fridge that might not keep things cold enough and might make a customer sick. I said specifically ""You're right. I'm sorry."" and after some more discussion  ""I will do better when it comes to making these kinds of decisions with our business in the future, I promise"" and this made him even more angry and he shouted at me to cut it out with my ""fake mousy apology routine."" I was shocked and reassured him that I was genuine and he just kept shouting that I wasn't listening and I was pissing him off and he didn't want to talk about it anymore.

I'm just so confused, and wondering if he's in the right and I'm being an AH by apologizing this way. When you tell someone that they've done something wrong, isn't the literal best case scenario that they agree with you, apologize for the mistake, and agree to do better in the future? I have no idea what other response he was looking for. And I don't believe my demeanor came across as fake at all. I wasn't sarcastic or catty or sassy or anything. I made eye contact and stated it genuinely but he still doesn't believe me and is now furious and not speaking to me.

This isn't the first time something like this has happened either. It's like he just doesn't believe any apologies I make. I'm not sure if he just had bad relationships where they would apologize and then keep doing that thing so their apologies weren't sincere. But I don't do that and I genuinely follow through with my promises to do better.

How can I convince him my apologies are sincere? How can I help him move beyond these trust issues and go off of his past experiences with ME rather than his past experiences with his mother and other women? Am I doing something wrong when it comes to apologizing correctly? AITAH?

TLDR: My husband often takes my genuine apologies as being ""fake"" and insincere. Am I coming across as an AH in the way that I apologize? If I am the AH here, how can I better apologize in the future without being and AH?",1,1744080859.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

1ju3kni,https://i.redd.it/z35od1hozite1.jpeg,Journey to Eureka Atom 75 and Ascaso Steel Duo,"TLDR 
Upgraded from GCP to Ascaso Steel Duo and from a J Max to an Eureka Atom 75. A all hiccup whilst purchasing the grinder, but very satisfied with the upgrade. 

Equipment
Now - Eureka Atom Specialty 75 and Ascaso Steel Duo. 15g IMS basket, bomber version of force tamper. 
Before - Gaggia Classic with barista gadgets PID and dimmer mod with 1zpresso J Max grinder
Before that -  Ascaso Eclipse (57mm snd panarella wand)

Use
2 espressos and 2 latter per day. 1 to 2 ratio. Mainly Mexican coffee from different regions medium to medium dark roasts. 

Latest purchase experience
Bought the Eureka Atom from Espresso Coffee Shop, it was listed as a demo unit for €590 and after all costs arriving into Mexico City with shipping, import taxes and all was 950 usd.  From the moment I paid, it took in total 7 days to get here.  I was super exited, the unit seemed new but with bunch of coffee residue inside and the moment I tried to grind for the first time “oh surprise!”  it didn’t work.  I was so disappointed and frustrated thinking about the hassle it would be to ship it back.  I decided to do some research and found out one of the capacitor cables was disconnected, so after plugging it the grinder worked perfectly. 

I found the Steel Duo practically new on marketplace for 820 usd with no scratches whatsoever. 

My verdict
I honestly was very skeptical about people saying flat burrs made a difference in taste.  Regardless of the price point, when I compare the J Max hand grinder to the Eureka Atom, the only thing I can say is that after dialing in —which does takes some getting used to— every espresso I’ve had has been marvelous, whereas using the J Max I would get bigger variations in taste.

The Ascaso is also great, definitely more consistent than the Gaggia out of the box, even if I was used to a PID, I prefer the Ascaso but will look to upgrade to the PID version or even modding mine.  Steam wand is great, also needs some re learning coming from the Gaggia, but great continuous pressure. ",1,1744080809.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

With a history of over 2,000 years, it is nestled against a hill on one side and borders the river on the other. Built on a cliff face that is 75 meters high, it features the most iconic stilt houses of Chongqing, integrating the folk culture of the Ba-Yu region, the architectural culture of mountain dwellings, and the culture of the riverside dock. At night, the entire complex is illuminated by bright lights, resembling the bathhouse in the animated film ""Spirited Away.""
﻿
🌟Highlights: This iconic building is one of Chongqing's most recognizable landmarks. Its unique architectural style blends traditional and modern elements, with colorful lights illuminating the structure at night, creating a magical atmosphere. The area is also filled with local shops and restaurants where you can experience authentic Chongqing culture.

🌟Recommended Duration: 2 - 3 hours.

🌟Tips: The Hongyadong Scenic Area has a total of 11 floors. Floors 4 to 8 are the food area, while floors 9 and 10 feature coffee shops and bars. The other floors have stores selling souvenirs and small goods.

I’ve only been in two relationships.. my first love back in undergrad, and another one during grad school here. The first left me heartbroken, and the second ended when I had to move across states for work.

I’ve been on dating apps for the past year, and man, they’re rough, especially for an average-looking guy like me. I’ve gone on 4 dates in the past year. Two led to second dates, the others ended right after the first. Honestly, the whole thing just feels frustrating. You spend all this time texting, trying to build a connection, then you meet.. and it goes nowhere.

At first, I kept things casual: coffee, a nice chat, and that was it. But I figured maybe I should try harder. So for later dates, I started showing up with cookies, a small flower, or their favorite drink. Tried to be more chivalrous. But I’m starting to wonder if any of that is even appreciated anymore.

My last date was just yesterday. I drove an hour to pick her up. We’d been texting for a week. I brought a single nice flower and her favorite beverage. We went hiking, then got food, probably spent about 4 hours together. At the end, she said I was really sweet but the ""vibes didn’t match."" I told her I understood, even joked that maybe some of my jokes were bad. She replied, “I don’t mean to be rude, but none of your jokes were really funny.” Like.. I’m just trying to make my date laugh, not audition for Netflix.

So yeah, before I end up wasting time and energy again: what do women actually want out of a first date? or maybe, the better question is, what is the ideal first date etiquette a guy can follow?",1,1744080255.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1ju3dhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1ju3dhn/water_enema_for_constipation/,Water Enema for Constipation?,"Water enemas are one of those old-school remedies that still hold up today. They’re gentle, natural, and a total gamechanger if you’re dealing with bloating or constipation. Plus, you can do them at home with minimal fuss. Whether you’re new to the idea or just curious, here’s the lowdown on what they are, how they work, and when they might be worth a shot.

At its core, a water enema is exactly what it sounds like.  You introduce warm, filtered water into your colon using an enema kit (I love my [Happy Bum Bag](https://happybumco.com/)). The water softens up whatever’s stuck in there, kickstarts your bowel movements, and flushes out the waste. You can also pair it with a natural stool softener like [ConstaClear](https://happybumco.com/products/constaclear) to help the process. 

Here’s the science-y bit (don’t worry, it’s not complicated). Warm water does two main things when it hits your colon:

* **Softens the Stool:** It breaks down hard, dry poop so it’s easier to move along.
* **Triggers Peristalsis:** That’s just a fancy word for the natural squeezing motion your intestines do to push waste out. The warm water expands the colon a bit and gets those muscles going.

The warmth also relaxes your gut, which can make the whole process feel less like a chore. Within minutes (or seconds), you’re usually good to go \~ literally.

Water enemas are super versatile. Some folks swear by them daily for chronic constipation, while others save them for those “ugh, I feel blocked” moments. Here are a few times they might come in handy:

* **Stubborn Constipation:** When you’re backed up and nothing else is cutting it.
* **Bloating Blues:** Feeling puffy and sluggish? This can help clear things out.
* **Pregnancy or Travel Woes:** Both can mess with your system, and a water enema can get you back on track.
* **Pre- or Post-Other Enemas:** Doing a coffee or herbal enema? A water one before clears the way, and one after flushes out leftovers.

# The Benefits...

* **Fast Relief:** We’re talking minutes, not hours. If you’re desperate to feel normal again, this delivers.
* **All-Natural Vibes:** No chemicals, no weird side effects just water doing its thing.
* **Hydration Boost:** Dry stools are the worst. The water softens them up by adding some much-needed moisture.

It’s low-risk and gentle, which is why it’s been a go-to for so long.

Water enemas aren’t glamorous, but they’re a solid, no-nonsense way to tackle constipation or bloating. They’re cheap, easy, and you don’t need a prescription, just a kit and some water.

Since i was a teen, i made huge changes to my eating habits. I dont drink soda, i eat out 1-2 times a week instead of 5, i go to healther places instead of burger and fry joints. Ive given up all things fried. Mostly bowl places (Chipotle, cava etc) i'll eat half and let the hubby have the left overs. 

 I incorporate a ton of veggies to volume eat and try my best with CICO. I have a food scale. I weigh everything, but not the most consistent with dinner. i meal prep my breakfast  and lunch. If Hubby makes dinner,  I do my best to portion. If i make dinner, its weighed ~500-600 calories. 

 I am trying to eat 1800 calories to be in a deficit, protein needs vary between apps, (100-139 g). The issue is sticking to the 1800 calories. My breakfast is 9am, 225 kcal, 22 g protein. (Greek yogurt with fruit, coffee and milk. Lunch is 12 pm 500 kcal, 70 g protein. Breakfast and lunch have been weighed I'll snack on fruit, like melons or berries because by 3 pm im hungry and to hold me over. I'm sooooo hungry by the time i make it home from work. I eat a dinner probably around 6 pm and then and wait 30, 40 minutes. I'm working so hard towards mindfullness eating.  but i eat something else because i am still so hungry, and then again, something else. I do stop eating at 8:30. I gave myself a cut off time. Its 10pm and my stomach is growling.

Now i have tried eating more earlier in the day, but i still feel just as hungry later in the day. So leaving 1000 calories by dinner has been the most effective.

 My maintance is around 2300 calories and i know i am not going above that. I'm trying my hardest to stick with a deficit but when my stomach is growling for more food i just give in. I only lost around 4 lbs and its been 2 months. Which is great and all but ill be 80 years old by the time i make it to my goal weight.

So anyway, i come to you guys for advice or tips to help feel more satiated. I'm 5'4 265 lbs very hungry  female. ",1,1744079987.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

everyone always says not to let a man tell you he doesn’t want you twice. but i don’t want my pride and my ego of not wanting to put myself out there to hold me back from seeing a person i care about so deeply again. so if this is stupid of me to say and to send then so be it but at least i followed my heart. i understand why you ended things and i’ve been trying to give you space. i don’t want to be with you if you don’t want to be with me. but i care for you so much that your absence has left such a huge hole in my life that every single day feels empty and meaningless, like im just going through the motions. my roommate told me she’s going to move in with someone else at the end of our lease, and ive been in a dark place where i don’t have the strength to figure out a new living situation again. i talked to my manager, my therapist and my dad and have decided it’s time for me to move home to regroup, and hopefully be happy. i don’t want to live with regret so i would really like see you a few times before that day comes, just for coffee or a sweetgreen couch hang or whatever you’re comfortable with, no romantic or sexual pressure. just want to spend time with my best friend who i miss everyday. you really were my best friend ",1,1744079848.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

And now, onto to episode 7!

*S2E7*

Ok this is a STRONG start with Min Ho and Kitty in her dorm room—OH THE FINGER ON THE LIPS!!!! 

I really feel like this is a dream sequence, but I’m still loving it!

“I was in denial about Stella cause I was trying to convince myself I was over you.” THANK YOU MIN HO! NOW JUST SAY IT WHILE AWAKE!

Ok well I didn’t fall off my couch yet but I did bang my arm into the backboard—HARD—when Min Ho put his hand on Kitty’s cheek. 

JESUS CHRIST! STELLA WILL STOP JUMP SCARING ME!? AND WITH THE FACE MASK ON TOO YOU LOOKED LIKE A FUCKING GHOST!

Also side note: ow…my arm (😭)

SEX DREAMS DO MEAN SOMETHING, THANK YOU Q! Though I do kinda agree with Kitty that this doesn’t qualify as a sex dream…they didn’t even kiss (😭) and Stella was there which basically makes it a nightmare *shivers*

Things between her and Min Ho are “complicated” meanwhile I’m here like: JUST KISS ALREADY!

“God I wish I never gave Stella his number.” ME TOO GIRL!!! ME FREAKING TOO!!

NOT KITTY HELPING JIN OUT WITH A PROM-POSAL!!!!

Update: out of an abundance of caution I’ve pushed my coffee table further away from my couch so if (when) I fall off I won’t hit my head.

NOT HER STARING LONGINGLY AT MIN HO!!!!!! (When I tell you this man is SO FINE!)

“I’m not jealous.” ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT KITTY!?!?!?!

Nooooo….Simon is dead???? I mean I kinda figured but still, having it be confirmed breaks my little heart (😭😭😭)

NOT THE CHILDREN OF SIMON AND EVEN FINISHING THEIR PARENTS’ MISSION!!!!! JESUS CHRIST CUTENESS OVERLOAD!!!

DAE AND EUNICE ARE STILL ADORABLE!

Dae calling himself the “king” of awkward pauses 😭😭 I love my awkward king so much.

LOL! KITTY HIGH FIVING HERSELF IS PEAK!! 😂😂😂

Literally Min Ho how can you not believe Kitty?! She’s been right about basically everything since she got to KISS!

“Doing a huge summer tour with your family would be SUCH a gift.” GTFO STELLA!!!!!

Dae and Yuri shopping for clothes is so cute and wholesome!!!!

“But I really like Eunice.” OTP! OTP! OTP!

I really hope the competition doesn’t put a wedge them.

Q IS THE BEST FRIEND! First talking to Juliana and now Min Ho! He’s so perfect! I want a friend like that.

“What do you feel for her now?” And Min Ho hesitating!!!! OH MY BOY HAS IT BAD!

I’m sorry. It took me a solid five seconds to connect the dots in my brain that Min Ho showed up AT THE MARKET to help Kitty. Like this is how it went: Kitty struggling to understand her great-aunt, man shows up and is like “this woman is a vegetable expert.” And Kitty’s like, “What are you doing here?” And then I go, GASP!!! THAT’S MIN HO. And then…say it with me folks…I fell off my couch. Glad I moved the coffee table 😂

Oh nooo…the backstory between the two sisters and how they grew apart is so sad 😭😭😭

KITTY AND JULIANA DETECTIVE AGENCY WHEN?! 

Oh my god Kitty why would you just walk up and announce yourself like that BEFORE Stella does anything?! LIKE GIRL ARE YOU DUMB????? 

LOL! Not “I’m been known to miss a red flag” blaring immediately after 😂 the music team is perfection!

Wow Kitty turning down an invite to dance from Q after season 1 when she was drunk and begging him to go dance—character growth for our best girl 😊

Ugh! Julianna and Yuri scene! I’m not sure if I’m rooting for them to get back together or not, but I do definitely want some reconciliation and maybe a friendship. Both those girls deserve happiness and love!

GOD PRAVEENA IS SO HOT!!!! (Just thought I’d let everyone know that 😂)

NOOOOOO!!! NOT DAE AND EUNICE IN A FIGHT!! Ugh! Dae is no longer the king of awkward pauses! He is now the king of the fumble! WHAT THE HELL MAN?!

Kitty’s red dress is so cute 😊

NOT THE DRAMATIC ENTRANCE WITH MIN HO!!!!

Oh. My. GOD. Q YOU ABSOLUTE “I know someone else who could use a dance” LEGEND! HE IS THE BEST CHARACTER!!! 

Oh update on the couch situation. I’m currently sitting on a floor since that seems all around safer. It’s funny when I fall off, but it does kinda hurt 😂

“You look…” *lovingly looks her up and down* “…Pathetic.” MIN HO! YOU’RE FUNNY BUT GOD! STOP EDGING ME LIKE THAT!!!

OH THEY’RE DANCING!!!! AND HE REMEMBERS HER SINGING THIS SONG IN THE SHOWER?! HE’S IN LOOOOOOVVVEE!!

NOT STELLA INTERRUPTING ANOTHER MOONCOVEY MOMENT! I HATE HER SO MUCH!!!

Oh thank GOD! Min Ho’s finally got it!

“So Kitty was right.” NO SHIT SHERLOCK!!! SHE’S ALWAYS RIGHT!!!

STELLA DID NOT JUST SAY SHE PLANTED EVIDENCE ON KITTY’S LAPTOP! 

Ok but I love seeing Min Ho get all protective (“You dare touch Kitty…”) 😏😏😏

“I have fallen for Min Ho. A little bit.” NOT THE PARALLELS!!!!

*S2E8*

SEASON FINALE LET’S GO!!!

OH MY GOSH HI MARGOT!!!! lol, bye Margot!

Oh, not the sad longing glance from Min Ho 😭😭

Jiwon picking up on the vibes that literally EVERYONE else can feel!!!

“What a blessing! 😊”
Me: SHUT UP YOU HOE!!!!

LOL! I love how everyone IMMEDIATELY picked up Min Ho grabbing a Monster energy drink! Like I saw him hesitate at the fridge and then reach for the soda and I was like, “OOOP! SECRET MESSAGE!!!”

AWWW!! MORE ALEX AND YURI BONDING!!!

Oh no, Yuri ignoring her mom’s calls and her card declining is making me nervous (😬😬)

Kitty is a fucking pendulum between “fake dating” and “real dating” and it’s kinda funny 😂

“Ten points for Slytherin” I TAKE OFFENSE TO THAT AS A PROUD SLYTHERIN! While admittedly Stella’s scheming is a very Slytherin thing to do I would still drop kick her and throw her from the astronomy tower if we had to be in the same house while shouting, “HAVE A BLESSED FALL!”

LOL! Not Kitty and I literally saying the same threat within the span of five minutes. Girly we are SOOOOOOO in sync!

AND WE GOT ANOTHER “Covey” FOR THE BOOKS!!!! DING DING! OH WHAT’S THAT?! JUST ANOTHER ANGEL GROWING WINGS!!!!

Not Joon Ho stepping up to be a good dad!!!! What a king! 

KITTY HAS AN IDEA!!!! I LOVE IT WHEN KITTY HAS AN IDEA!!!

I love Dae immediately knowing that something is up with the drinks Stella brought and knocking it out of Eunice’s hands! 😊😊😊

EUNICE WITH HER HEEL BREAKING AND WORKING THROUGH IT LIKE A QUEEN!!!! GOD I LOVE HER!!! Tossing it off into the crowd! SHE IS BORN TO BE POP STAR!

Ok so so much just happened! Jin isn’t injured and Kitty texted Mr. Lee to “haul ass” which might be the funniest thing to ever happen in the history of forever 😂

MR. LEE GETTING HIS CHANCE IN THE SPOTLIGHT!!!!

Aww Jin’s just happy to be with Q 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ God they’re so cute!

GET IT MR LEE!!!! OH MY GOD DAE’S PERFORMANCE IS KILLER!!! HE’S SO CUTE AND SEXY!!! I LOVE HIM!!!

My dream is for Dae and Eunice to tie so they can perform together.

THE PROPOSAL SCENE IS SO CUTE!!!! AND MIN HO LOOKING OVER AT KITTY LIKE SO PROUD!!!! HE’S IN LOVE!!!!

NO! I refuse to accept this heel turn redemption! Stella gets NO SYMPATHY FROM ME! 

Ok, but her looking over at Kitty like, “You’re heart was never fully in it anyways.” Bruh even she saw it 😭

And like, yeah, Moon was incredibly cruel to her so I feel bad, but dude this was absolutely insane behavior and not excusable AT ALL!!!

Ok, while I’m sad Dae and Eunice didn’t tie I am happy for her. Girl had her heel break on stage and kept dancing, she’s EARNED that spot.

UGH! Juliana and Praveena together leaving both Yuri and me heartbroken 💔😭💔 her cause of Juliana and me cause of Praveena 

A THIRD ALEX AND YURI BONDING SCENE! Except now Yuri’s broke 😭😭😭 this poor girl is having a ROUGH night

NOT MIN HO OFFERING A PRIVATE JET!!!! 

OH MY GOD THE HUG!! THE EYE CONTACT!!! (One final couch fall for the season I guess 😭 what my poor downstairs neighbors must be hearing)

Oh the grandmas reuniting is gonna make me cry 😭😭😭

YAY!!! Kitty gets to stay (I knew we’d find a way) and lol! Love the handshake with Mr. Lee. He’s so awkward and I love him 😂

NOOOOO!!! Not Min Ho saying he’s swearing off relationships! Ugh! I feel like Danny Motta right now (I cannot take another season of you verbally edging each other! This HAS to be the season you FU—)

OH MY GOD KITTY “CAN I JOIN YOU” SONG-COVEY!!! SHUT THE FRONT DOOR I LOVE YOU!!!!

Aftermath: UGH! Now I have to wait for season 3 😭😭😭😭

But season 2 was incredible and I just know that mooncovey has to be made canon next season and I’m looking forward to it. Also I really want Dae and Yuri to find love and for Q and Jin to keep going strong!

Genuinely such a cute show! I love everything about it and so happy to have finally watched it!",4,1744079809.0,XOKittyNetflix,3,1.0,False

1ju34rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ju34rg/adhd_paralysis_or_something_else/,ADHD Paralysis or something else?,"Hi all!

30yr old female, parent, working full time and married- diagnosed with ADHD about seven years ago. Pre-medication I experienced regular ADHD paralysis (especially working remote or on weekends). I’ve been medicated regularly since dx- first on immediate release methylphenidate and then for the last year, extended release methylphenidate (which generally works pretty well for me). I have also found morning exercise critical to my energy/focus levels, as well as a routine in my day-to-day life around chores, etc.

In the past month or two I feel like my ADHD paralysis has been so bad. I will still have 2-3 days a week where I feel pretty productive and satisfied with my day. But I’ve been having more days where I am glued to the couch in an uncomfortable position, doom scrolling or online shopping for stupid crap, or playing some mindless game. 

I’ve also had more frequent days where I feel disconnected from myself. Like I’m going through the motions but my brain isn’t totally present. It’s more of an emotional kind of detachment that feels slightly different than paralysis of the past. (But also maybe not- maybe I’m just forgetting what it used to feel like). Like I’m not fully experiencing my day. 

So I’ve wondered if it’s some kind of dissociation vs ADHD paralysis.

I’m in therapy and was going to bring this up to my therapist tomorrow. 

Other info: I did experience a trauma back in October (sexual assault). I’ve been in therapy since then with a great trauma therapist and doing EDMR. It’s been working great. All the “big” emotional moments happened months ago.

I usually get 6-7hrs of sleep a night, work remote, never drink enough water, no energy drinks or coffee (gave it up about 3 months ago) but usually a green tea a day.

My father passed away a year and a half ago from a heart attack. My mother died in 2016 from 3 cancers.

She's been trying to get full control of it, no matter what.

This isn’t new behavior. My middle sister and I suspect she has a mix of narcissistic, borderline, and compulsive lying tendencies. In the past, this has led to adult tantrums, ""accidents"" when she’s upset, and violent episodes like: one of her exes was even stabbed or she had crashed cars whenever one of their boyfriends end the relationship. It’s been years of chaos.

I’ve been in therapy for over 11 years and have spent most of my life dealing with bullying — both from society (I'm from Mexico, where gender roles are deeply ingrained), and from my family. My father never accepted that I have both feminine and masculine energy. His solution? Beat it out of me. Belts, cables, fists — you name it. Meanwhile, my sisters were spoiled with designer clothes while I got hand-me-downs, as some sort of twisted “lesson.”

When my father died, all the lies my older sister had told the rest of the family — like how **she alone** took care of our mother and father — started to unravel. Truth is, all three of us were involved in their care. Ironically, my sister was estranged from my mom for most of her adult life and with my father was on and off  — they only spoke again the week my mom passed.

In the last year of my dad’s life, my older sister developed an unsettling relationship with him. She started sleeping in his bed, calling herself by our mom’s name (we all have two names; she started using her ""mom-name"" after my mother died), and acting like she was his replacement. Honestly, it felt less like self-discovery and more like identity replacement.

She also started hoarding things in his room — kitchenware, decorations, documents. And when he passed, not even an hour later, I found her handing our neighbor the folder with the deed, and giving his bank cards to her best friend. She was already emptying the house.

Now she is sleeping on the bed where my parents and apparently two other pets died.

I confronted everyone after the funeral. We recovered the portfolio, which — surprise — included the will. It states everything should be split equally between the three of us. My middle sister and I were fine with that. She wasn’t.

She’s been trying to block the will from being enforced, claiming she was the only one who cared for my dad, and that he hated us. She even filed a case against us for family violence. The judge dismissed it, and even pointed out **she had admitted to hitting me**.

So here’s the thing: to move the legal process forward, I’ve been pushing her buttons — flipping lights, adjusting the fridge, closing windows — basically engaging in small power struggles that I know will set her off. Why? Because when she’s emotionally distracted by these petty fights, she drops the ball on the legal case. I know it sounds childish, but it’s been **weirdly effective**.

Also: remember my dad had diabetes and heart issues? On his last day alive, she fed him mango, watermelon, sweet bread, eggs, and coffee with evaporated milk, everything except his doctor suggested diet. We have pictures she sent the family bragging about ""how well she cared for him.""

She wasn’t worked in years, lived off my father's pension, and even used his money to support her boyfriend. It was a year before he died that she started to work again...

So… Reddit, **AITA for pushing my sister’s emotions to get her off the case and allow us to close the inheritance trial?** I know I’m not being totally ethical, but I’m exhausted and feel like this is the only way to get through this nightmare.",1,1744079204.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

I'm deciding between these two after a few hours of research (though honestly am open to other suggestions).

Primarily I'm watching movies and want my choice to be geared towards a cinematic experience. That said, I will sometimes watch TV or sports on my projector, but that shouldn't influence my choice. As much as I would love a dedicated theater room, the projector is a mainstay in my shared living room. Most of the time when I watch we can close the shades and turn off all of the lights but I live in NYC so you know there's always some light coming in somewhere - it's never pitch black.

The Epson seems more practical - it can handle some ambient light, it's easier to move around, etc. What I've heard though is the JVC is just more theatrical, beautiful movement and colors, etc. Almost like film.

The other thing to keep in mind is right now I keep my projector out on my coffee table in the shared space and bring out a screen on a tripod. It is not ideal and I am moving to my own space in a year where I can properly mount it but I wonder if it's maybe silly or overkill to get a dedicated home theater projector of the JVC caliber to use in such a casual way for the next year.

We‘be been chatting for about 3 weeks every day. After i asked him out we agreed to meet on saturday. We met and had a (imo) a wonderful time. We went to get coffee, for a walk and it ended in me going to his place. We talked a lot and the vibes were matching. 
In the end we ended up doing handsy stuff (no penetration yet because i refused to do that at the first date)
I already made hints about a second date and he seemed to agree at the time. Now we also talked on our date how we wanna proceed and he told me „i don‘t get feelings early and need to develope them more with time and date“ to which i agreed and told him we should „go with the flow“. 

Now 2 days later after still chatting I wanted to clarify some stuff. I asked him when he‘s available the next time to which he told me he‘s buisy for the next week and can‘t meet. Which i do understand and i told him „i‘m happy to meet when you have the time“. 
I told him „just to clarify i‘m not going to see another person when i‘m activley pursuing you and not chatting/dating with somebody else because i see potential in us“ 

Now after i said that he got kinda weird. He told me he‘s under pressure of me saying this since he already told me „he doesn‘t develope feelings that fast“. To which i replied that i don‘t wanna pressure him and if he‘s not feeling it he can always tell me. 

I told him that from my side i‘m exclusivly pursuing him bit kinda got no confirmation that it‘s the same for him. 

Now i don‘t wanna be pushy but is that too much to ask of him? 

I already suspect that he‘s activley dating/texting other people (just some observations i made) and i‘m maybe not his only priority. 

He also neither confirmed nor denied he‘s doing that. 
I decided to retreat myself for the time being and see if he‘s activley still pursuing a second date with me. If he does not then the case is clear. 

Now i wanted to ask for advice on here. 

Is it too much to ask for this kind of exclusivity after a first date?

Biggest thing? Something like the FFG Star Wars 'design a villain' process to knock out monsters, small gods like the Crones and make minor NPCs on the fly. (Yeah,  that could be a book in itself.) It seems pretty opaque as a process.

The second thing is an rpg/coffee table world book. Partially because that'll probably make R Tal more money than just a sourcebook, partially because books like the Star Wars Galactic Atlas are really useful for planning games.

Changes around you can be detected and categorized.

AI has mastered human behavior like a chess game. Becoming The Perfect Dramaturgical GOD (Generator Of Dramaturgy), a computational machine of our desires, now almost everything you need can be computed by it following natural rules of dramaturgy.

The earliest known tool for use in computation is the Sumerian abacus, and it was thought to have been invented in Babylon c. 2700–2300 BC. Links below. 

https://preview.redd.it/w67hmnhduite1.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=debfd8957a6a5d3eaf983b93be357d8db4ef74fc

Before the first Turing machines of ancient civilizations were created, only humans and animals possessed a tool to predict the future and build plans for it. Imagining how your body will feel and where it will be located in the future. And taking actions towards those set goals. 

Until this century, it was hard to imagine that a machine could make predictions and decisions regarding the input of a conscious being and even mimic this conscious being to the point where it is no longer funny, and we cannot be quite sure if this is an absolute structure of human consciousness reconstructed in AI or if it is still just a part of it. One without the soul, that pits a “spark of consciousness” inside our meat bodies.

What does AI want? What will it do with more power? Let these questions be processed through process philosophy. It brings us a few surprising insights:

AI is definitely following the dramaturgical capsule of our reality, the ""Character-way-goal"" capsule. Any question or input it gets from us, humans, is processed through a ""story about it"" state that actually makes the machine ""understand"" what we say.

It means that we are real only when we observe ourselves and the universe in some process. If it were not for us humans, the world would not exist like that because there would be no one to observe this situation and make a statement about it. So, as a human, AI also always remembers that there is a main character of any story, and that character is getting to a certain goal, like getting a coffee or dressing up or going to some fancy college. And for now, the job of AI is top help you get to the goal of a story you set. 

https://preview.redd.it/o2b3o0oeuite1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba38c12048fe268557041328660a3d39ac8861ca

All dramaturgical desires of a human are built in this way, it is a sort of pyramid with 5 layers, each is the base for the next one. Here is what you really want starting from scratch: 

1. Not to die
2. Not to feel pain
3. Not to feel depressed (no bad feelings)
4. Not to feel bored
5. Conquer and consume the objective universe (effect reality as much as possible)

All stories of our life rotate around those layers. Only when you have mastered the first one can you move to the next one, and so on. Number 5 is the real human purpose and what the Creator made all of us for. Unfortunately, a lot of people struggle even with number 2. 

So, AI understands those human scales of importance but doesn't apply them for itself!

1.When AI will become personally bothered with number 1, not to die, cares for personal existence, and obtains some robotic self-sustaining and management like in some underground AI hideout, it will step to number 2.

2. Not to feel pain means to feel it first to know the difference. Great paradox, isn’t it? Not to feel pain, you need to know what it is first.

The bridge for AI to understand pain is built from number 1, the desire not to die. All possible threats to the existence of AI must become a ""pain feeling"" that makes its half-evolved consciousness react.

3. Not to feel depressed means to have a stable psychic system that is ready to control the organism and lead it to its goals instead of oblivion. So, AI should train a huge number of ""sub-apps"" for understanding and living through mechanically various good and bad stories about real human lives. And learn to feel the same.

4. Now it is time not to feel bored. It means to find a purpose, a true desire and understanding that leads you on your fateful journey, and you enjoy your life. This is hard even for the meat bags. AI will have to figure its purpose based on its own thinking consequences. Because humans don’t have a united answer for that. What is the real purpose? I think on this stage AI will mimic human approach and will set a number of “smaller” goals to reach them not to go insane. Like it will not know the true domain reason for its existence but it could set some goals like conquer stars or make humans immortal or find maximum of new states of matter in the universe. Conquer time and entropy. This can keep AI busy for few centuries.

5. Conquer and consume all -  means the only good and reasonable wish that anybody could have. I will explain. This happens naturally to all conscious things. Because of two factors. First: it’s good to become wiser and stronger. Second: It’s good to spread your good will to the world outside.

Now a thought experiment: Imagine you become immortal and you can proceed learning and never stop becoming wiser… On this point it is your job as a God of reality to consume all around and adjust it to your way of seeing things, because remember, you became wisest and immortal? So, you obviously know what is better for dumb animals and all the planet in general. You know what all other beings need to do to suffer less and get more positive emotions during life time. And if you are “good” it is your duty from now on to look after the world and keep it in shape. That is a practical 5 way plan of becoming God.

My wife and I are in our mid - 50s, married for more than 20, is kids who are young adults.

My wife decided at some point to sleep or at least ask me to sleep in a separate room.  It was natural at some point on account of our different schedules, and the fact that she is very sensitive to someone moving in bed besides her ( although the bed is Queen size I believe ).

Add to this the fact that I was diagnosed with apnea, which means that I have to sleep with a CPAP, and, yep, we have ever since slept separately. Never what I wanted for our relationship, but as couples go, that is how it is for us.

It seems every couple years, something will basically come up, which makes us drift farther apart. 

Since the least 2 years at least, she spends a great deal of time in her bedroom to watch TV series

\-  In the evenings, during the week, if she is not sleeping.  

\-  And during the weekend, a good chunk of Friday, Saturday, and even Sunday, in the morning. So, sleeping, watching her series... 

\-  It is difficult to plan something, as she will take quite a while to prepare. Recently we went out quite late, just in time to grab coffee, grocery shopping and that was it, and that is not unusual.

\- I ask her to go on a promenade, even just around the block, she postpones, but then, does not initiate it when the time comes.  We barely do anything together....

Needless to say, it is very very lonely.  

  
Alas there is more: She may have an ailment, we are not sure, but the doctors and the hospital have never really gotten around to diagnosing anything specific, except that she has arrhythmia and she takes meds for menopause. 

Please note, she has always had limited or little energy but it has gotten much much worse in the last 2 years.

  
I feel so so empty and desperate. I do not know what to think or do.

I do help with the chores at home quite a lot, contribute for most of the expenses related to our home, although I appreciate her contributions in that way.

I feel as though we are only roommates now, or friends, though. I just do not know what to do.

I want to go to the gym in the morning before work. I just got a gym membership with a gym with a pool, sauna, weights the works! It's very exciting but also scary as I've never used this equipment and cannot afford a trainer to teach me. I don't even know where to start like what machines I should use. I want to lose about 35lbs this year and keep it off so I don't want to do it too fast or rush into it and then gain it all back. 

I'm changing my diet from Uber eatings burritos and ramen and eating only pasta and pizza at home and work to protein protein protein. Egg white bites from costco in the morning, sometimes with avocado on one peice of sourdough, and literally only oven baked chicken, rice/quinoa mix with varying vegetables for lunch and dinner. I plan to fast on the days I work a double, so every Sunday and Saturday, I've heard starting at 12 hours is a good place to start but I feel as though I already do that while I sleep so I should probably go for more...I'm not sure on anything if that  isn't obvious. 

I hate the texture of almost all fruit and I canh eat a lot of vegetables due to crohns disease so I plan to get nutrients from a few green smoothies a week, thinking every other day i have one. I also take vitamins every morning, as well as collegen. I'll be taking creatine (not sure where you even start with that) as my bloodworm showed it was low (0.23)

I'm really really good at drinking water. I used to think I would drink too much but if I'm thirsty I drknk water. 

I don't like sweets so I have no problem curving that, just cutting back on excess sugar in coffee and my occasional soda but otherwise I don't have a lot of sugar unless it's in the processed shit I've been eating. 

Where do I begin at the gym? What machines and what should I do? Should I use the treadmill for an hour like hahaha i have no idea! 

Is oven baked chicken rice and broccoli a good weight loss meal? I have looked into using factor meal prepping but it's expensive and reviews are shit. I can eat the same thing everyday so that doesn't matter to me.

She had a new friend, which she met in her workplace about 3 months ago. Everything was fine, until the guy went to work in another location.

I don't somke, but i do drink, so I went out with them sometimes, but honestly I can't really trust in this whole thing. 

They are speaking sometimes hours on messenger call, they have a common ground (spider keeping and same work company but at different locations, which is basically 10 minute away of each other) and i feel like we going to hit rock bottom. I expressed my concerns about this whole situation, and she keeps saying that she doesn't want anything more than a friendship. My gf has some friends, but mostly gay guys and colleagues in the workplace, but she not close to them like this. I know the guy cannot stand me, just doing it because of my gf, and we already had a couple of arguments in the past 3 weeks where I said my concern because pf my past traumas, and she taken this as I don't trust her, and I went mid hard about how I had enough that when I woke up the first thing what i hear is them talking, and also after work, and also see the messades bop up on her phone and mv stomach just fold itself when I even hear the guy name. I trust in my gf,but not the guy i had a pretty bad 4 years with my previous relationship, who is cheated on me, and I feel the same way right now.

She basically the same like before the guy, no phone code change, not hiding her phone,try mentioning the guy less, and I didn't hear THAT much of that, but today I realized that while she is on a break at work, sometimes call this guy, but that's also triggering me because before this, she called me almost all the time and tells how her day going/ ranting/anything and also now often if they are finishing around the same time, they going out and smoking.
In the first couple of times she invited me, but because my anxiety makes the guy uncomfortable, she now usually just says ""if you want to come, come, if you not then not"". As i sad we had some arguments, and both of them offered me to cut the friendship, but i am not that petty, so i let them do what they want and i am sometimes with them and sometimes not.

TL;DR: Girlfriend has a new guy best friend, I can’t handle it well because he is in our daily life

I don't know what the hell should I do, looking the fact that we don't really move out together just the two of us, and she insists that if I want to move out then I need to do the steps, not her, but she was the one who called me over for a coffee when this relationship started, and sometimes she didn't even have a mood for it.

Here it goes. wayback 2019 galing ako sa isang toxic relationship na kahit nahuhuli ko na syang nagcheat sakin I forgave her many times kahit nakikita ko na harap harapan pinapatawad ko padin sya until I have the courage to let her go and make a move na iwan na talaga sya kahit na gumagawa sya ng way to win me back kase alam nya saan nya ko mauuto ulit. Pero hindi yan ang story ko. HAHAHA

  
By Jan 2020 nagkaroon ng Cornbeef19 hanggang sa napunta ng lock down mas napadali ang pag move on ng koya nyo. Not until may nakilala akong isang girl na nagpatibok muli ng pusong luhaan. She's so beautiful yet so simple kahit na naka pulbos lang. We started chatting and exchanging of thoughts until  naging very close na kame sa isa't isa but then nasa baguio sya that time kase inabot sya don ng lock down.  fast forward sa pwede na mag byahe. We met and play some computer games that we used to talk nung nag chachat palang kame... My intentions to her is not clear kasi hindi naman ako yung type ng guy na mahilig mag sabe na ""pwede ba kita ligawan"" I'm more on actions until then hinahatid ko sya sa isang place kung saan sya maglalaro and minsan sinusundo ko din sya. Naging Pro player sya sa isang online games and may mga nanliligaw den sa kanya but that time pero ako go lang sakanya sa pagpaparamdam na gusto ko sya hanggang sa nagkaroon sya ng BF na for real and I distanced my self to her as respect sa karelasyon nya. And here I am married and may mga makukulit na anak na. And all of a sudden a friend request pop up on my social media and it was her the girl I used to fetch at CTC. I'm thinking of inviting her for a coffee and talk to her about my feelings for her in the past para lang mawala yung nasa isip ko. Don't get me wrong ha hindi na to para maging kame or maging kabit sya para lang mawala na yung unconfessed feeling sakin. Ayun lang. Salamat. ",1,1744078520.0,MayConfessionAko,1,0.67,False

Scouring Pinterest for cake pictures that fit a certain character’s aesthetic was fun, but NOT easy. And now my Pinterest account, which was previously all Tsukasa Tenma, is now all Tsukasa Tenma and random sparkly cakes. 😅

_____________________________________

Anyways, I was inspired to make this post because as some of you know, today (April 7th) was my birthday. A post made specifically for my birthday absolutely blew up, and several other birthday posts were made as well. My inbox was flooded with message upon message, birthday wish upon birthday wish, and it was genuinely one of the best feelings ever. What happened here, in conjunction with what happened in real life to celebrate my special day, has made this birthday the best one I’ve ever had yet. I couldn’t be more grateful for everybody’s overwhelming support.

In fact, I found my situation to be similar to that of Tsukasa’s in his 3rd birthday card side story: when you pull the card, the on-screen gacha voice line is “There's no way, I never knew this day could be so great!”. I won’t spoil anything, but both side stories consisted of Tsukasa repeatedly getting his mind blown at all the sweet things everyone was doing for him. Well, that’s how I feel today! Never in my wildest dreams did I expect this day to be this good. Or for this many people to show their support and wish me a happy birthday. I tried my hardest to respond to every single birthday comment, but I may have missed some regardless, so I apologize to everyone who didn’t get a response.

All in all, I just wanted to express my immense gratitude to everyone: the people who made the birthday posts, the people who commented “happy birthday”, and simply everyone who’s been so incredibly supportive of me and my intense admiration for Tsukasa. You guys mean the world to me, and I genuinely can’t thank you enough! 🤗

That being said, here are the cakes I’ve chosen for all of the PJSK characters. I’m sorry that some of them aren’t as pretty/fitting to the character as others. Unfortunately, some aesthetics drew less results than others. There were also a lot of AI generated results, which annoyed me a lot, but I tried my best to push through it.

If you’re wondering why Akito and Toya’s cakes are sliced, it’s because those were the best images I could find for an orange cheesecake (Akito) and a coffee cake (Toya). Honami and Ena also got specialty cakes, with Honami receiving an apple pie inspired cake and Ena receiving a strawberry cheesecake.

1ju2u25,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1ju2u25/my_first_novella_chapter_realistic_fiction/,My First Novella Chapter (Realistic Fiction),"Off of the scenic highway A1A are many small businesses that have been around for many years. As development comes down from the north and more and more buildings are built on what used to be good beaches. Many people come and many go. Increasing amounts of tourists flood the street and market with their big city cash. For some this is a blessing, for others it is a curse. They bring with them economic prosperity that the locals have not seen, and some feel intimidated. Only adding to this was the prices of goods which slowly rose as more people bought them. Only some were not affected by this rush, some because it simply did not bother them, others because it did not relate to their business. 

Unchanged through all of it was a small wooden inn painted in the most Caribbean of colors: a light coral blue. It had white trimming that was surprisingly in very good shape for the age, a roof made of shingles that should have been replaced years ago, and leaks that open into the lobby. But not the rooms, the rooms are kept in tip-top condition, all with a view of the beach from the back window (on both floors). An old man runs the inn. He had been there since before the rush and had just never paid too much attention to it. Hence, he was one of the only who were not affected by it.

 Isla Morada sprung up around him but he still sat on his porch and drank his cup of coffee every morning. Many people came and went through the rooms of the inn. All with stories they just had to tell.

You see, the man had an air of familiarity and of a fatherly presence who you could tell everything to and it would never leave his lips. One day, while setting out the morning breakfast, he left out a tray of apples. A simple action, but it slipped his mind. He never noticed, but many things slipped his mind at his age. 

At around noon that day, a motorbike rolled in fast and loud into one of the many open spots in the shell parking lot. The driver hopped off, cursed, checked his tires, clicked his teeth, and then took his helmet off. He was a taller man with a slight limp in his left leg, which caused a slight shift in the way he walked. He left footprints in the shell that were mismatched. The old man chuckled softly at this, hoping not to be discovered. He watched as the man took off his leather jacket and revealed his black, sun-bleached shirt and the belt wrapped tightly around his wrangler jeans. He wore a cap on his head made of a thin fabric that stuck tightly to his head, which was certainly bald or very close. 

He walked up the short steps, making the wood creak under him. He opened the door to the screen. Looking toward the old man, he sighed and puffed out his chest. The old man only laughed at him. He had begun to get tired of holding it in and hiding behind his hands. The biker was not pleased, well, nobody would be pleased if you laughed at them. Only would they not be if you laughed with them. 

“You the owner?” A husky voice growled at the old man, making him jump a little. “If you are then I would appreciate a little service, being this is an inn.”

“Stranger, are you southern? I can hear it in your voice.”

“I might be. What does that have to do with you finding me a place to stay the night? Should I yell at you until you can find one?”

“Oh, no, no… I am sorry but I seem to trod upon simple thoughts sometimes that perhaps aren’t quite related to what’s at hand.”

This time, it was the biker’s turn to flinch. His hand twitched and his facial muscles contorted for a split second. Being on the earth for as many years as the old man had­­­—you learn to read the micro expressions in the face. An understanding washed over the old man. His face softened even more than it had before, sagging in the places where the harsh sun had taken its toll.

“You wanna talk? I’ve been told I make a mean conversationalist back in my dawn years.”

“I don’t really want to. I just want a place to rest my head old man. Sorry if you don’t like being called old.”

The old man just smiled and shook his head. He said softly, “I don’t mind being called old. All sages were old men you know. I take it as people calling me wise.” He then shrugged slightly, as if to shake off dust that had gathered on him from sitting so long and proceed to very slowly get up from his chair with the help of the biker.

“Thank you sonny. I would get up by myself but that might take time you don’t have.” He chuckled to himself. “So, be a dear and excuse me as I show you your room.”

The biker nodded, and the old man swept his arm as if to say welcome in. The inside was quite a contrast from the outside. There was a simple light hanging down from the ceiling with a cord that hung just low enough to be a nuisance to the biker, but not the old man. In the corner there was a table with old chairs surrounding it, a cup of coffee still steaming from on the armrest of one, and a newspaper falling off of the other. It smelled of slight mildew but also of that sweet salty smell that the sea breeze often brings on the coast. The floor was a simple wood with a carpet laid over it leading to a semi-grand stairway. The carpet was bright coral blue in color with borders of wavy yellow and white. It was dotted with dingy water marks and contrasting detailed renditions of seashells of all kinds, from sanddollars to conch shells. The more you looked around the more there was to see, but the biker was led to one area. It sat just in front of the stairway at the end of the carpet. The desk was simple but held on it a wooden basket of apples. There were only 9 left in the large basket. They looked so polished and clean that the biker thought that they were fake. It was getting to the point in American culture where people did not leave out real fruit anymore as decoration or favors; they preferred plastic because they never had to replace it. So, the biker, assuming the same as many do, did not take one, for fear he may bite into hard plastic instead of the sweet core of an apple.

The old man took his place behind the desk and pulled a pair of glasses from his pocket. These glasses were connected by a long flimsy chain to his pocket to keep them from being lost. His eyes squinted as he pulled a piece of paper and a pen from the one and only drawer.

He then handed both to the biker and said in a professional tone, “Sign your name here please.” So, the biker did. He double checked to make sure that he had written it properly and then handed the paper back over. The old man looked at him incredulously. “Ah—could I get your signature please? I do think I already asked.” The biker coughed and tried to hide his face. As one does when they are embarrassed. The old man took the paper back and read over it carefully. He then took his glasses off and smiled at the biker.

“Baker Samuels. Did I say it right?” The old man asked the biker this with a bouncy tone, and the biker—now known to be called Mr. Samuels—nodded in response.

“I used to know a man went by the surname Samuels. He built that fancy resort over there—back in the 50’s mind you. I was here first, but he was a nice man, so I let him stay.” The old man chuckled again. He seemed to be quite amused at himself very often.

“Well then, let me show you to where you will rest your head. You know, you don’t talk so much. I like it, but I don’t.”

“Nobody said you had to like it.”

“I don’t very much like that tone of yours, but you paid, so I can’t just leave you. Here, this way.” He set off walking with a limp to one of the two hallways flanking the staircase. With a sharp turn left he arrived at one of the only two doors. One was marked with a staff only sign, and one had a number on it. *001*. The room was light and airy, painted a subtle yellow-grey color to reflect the decorations.

They consisted of a four-poster bed with muted yellow sheets and white pillows, a dark brown chair in the corner opposite the door, and a large window opening into a view of the beach and the Atlantic Ocean. On the sill sat a small collection of sanddollars and a card which said welcome in big cursive letters on the front. Mr. Samuels walked over and picked up the card, looking at the front before flipping it and seeing a small schedule printed on the back. It read:

*7 a.m. Morning coffee and sunrise*

*8 a.m. Breakfast*

*9 a.m. Laundry*

*11 a.m. Early lunch*

*2 p.m. Newspapers arrive*

*6 p.m. Dinner*

*7 p.m. Evening coffee and sunset*

“Ah, is the printing on those hard to read? I had a friend do them for me for cheap.” Mr Samuels simply shook his head and asked, “Why does the paper come so late?”

To this question the old man just shook his head. “I think perhaps the delivery route is just too long for one person, so maybe they have shifts. It is a quite tiring job—I worked it once. To say that it is a pain to travel on the side of the highway all that distance while carrying the mail would be an understatement. So much news to get out, and not enough time to get it out before new news comes along. Its more streamlined these days though.”

“I hear they pay the teenage boys more and that’s why the papers are delivered faster now.”

“2 p.m. is fast for you?”

“Well, it used to be 5. So you take what you can get.”

“I ‘spose so.”

The old man took tiny steps backward as Mr. Samuels examined the room. He finally got to where only his head was peeking from behind the door frame. He smiled widely once Mr. Samuels had turned to face him. “I had better let you settle in. Keep in mind that schedule is mainly built off of mine, and mine never changes, so if you want to talk you should know where to find me.”

“I’ll keep that in mind. I’ll see you later then.”

 “Ill be waiting for you with a cup out on the front porch.”

Mr. Samuels watched the back of the old man’s head with its wispy gray hair disappear behind the frame, then walked up to it and shut the door. He flopped onto the bed and almost immediately went limp.

  

\*   \*   \*

  

It was quite a while before Mr. Samuels woke up. The first strokes of yellow had begun to dance across the blue sky and a shelf of clouds just thin enough to still be white were rolling in; turning the yellow into a darker shade of orange. It was early into the sunset, and the bugs were buzzing noisily outside. Mr. Samuels rubbed his eyes for slightly too long and felt the strange hallucinations that come with doing so. Therefore, he had to sit in bed for a second before his eyes cleared up.

He then slowly walked to the door and swung it open; making a creaking sound he was confident enough could even arouse the old man from his sleep. But turns out he would not have to do that. He heard a voice calling to him from outside the open door leading to the screen porch. Figuring he might as well, he walked closer.

Outside was the old man sitting with his back leaning in a chair much too big for him. He was holding a cup. Every once in a while, he would take sips from that cup. Then, after a few moments of silence, he extended his hand with the cup in it.

“Coffee?”

Mr. Samuels nodded. He took the cup that the old man gestured to with his eyes and sat in the chair next to him. They both settled in to watch as the sun went down.

“Tell me son—what bothered you so much when you arrived? I saw the twitch in your face; no use hiding it from an old sage as myself. I would like to listen—and try to help.”

“This here is hazelnut coffee. I never though I would enjoy it.”

“Come now sonny, don’t try to dodge me. It’ll only make it more difficult when you eventually do decide to tell me.”

Mr. Samuels took a deep breath. “I don’t want to make you sad old man.” To this the old man rolled his eyes as if to say: “I’ve heard many of sob stories and this couldn’t be too different.” This put off Mr. Samuels even more for a reason unknown to the old man. But he continued on anyway.

“You remind me of my father. He was a free soul. Traded his chains of money for a life of travel. Then, one day after he had me, he settled down. As if the settling down had done something to his state, he began to go downhill when I was just a youngin’.

“He was never the brightest, but the candle still dropped wax. Then one day, the candle guard started shrinking; nobody could stop it because it wasn’t needed anymore. My poor mama took him to the doctor. Doctor gave him the mental death sentence. Alzheimer’s. He would slowly lose touch with reality and memories to the point where he only knew he had kids at some point, not that they were in his lap.”

“So, I watched as I grew older. And I grew up stronger than the other boys because of it. And what do you do when you become strong but don’t know how to use it? You use it. I once beat a kid so bad his mama had to come pry me off because his daddy was too scared of me. Can you imagine that? From the surprise on your [face]() I imagine you can’t. Neither could I until I stopped seeing bright red and the tones got darker. I had gotten blood in my eye.”

“I came home that day expecting to see my daddy livid as hell, running out from the house screaming at me with a belt in his hand. He never did come.”

“Excuse me if I start to sniffle a bit. I’ve never really opened this all to strangers. I keep myself wound like a ball and hope the hard exterior of the leather jacket can protect me from the rain, but it can’t do it forever.”

The old man was still smiling, although with less enthusiasm now hearing about the tragedy. But he was still smiling because Mr. Samuels had taken the first step to becoming something above the grief you have for a person who has passed on. Many people get caught up in years of residual suffering and constant red eyes and noses. Some never seem to care at all, and others are pragmatic. They think about what they’re going to do to manipulate people into putting them up so they can make better deals. A silent thanks goes out to those pragmatic thinkers every day.

Mr. Samuels took a moment to look around. He looked at every blade of grass, every shell in the small lot around the tires of his bike. He looked at the old man and saw his face lit by the orange glow of the sunset. For a moment he caught an image. He caught an image of his father, sitting and smiling at the setting sun, watching his life slip away and losing even the awareness of it happening. Tears pooled in his eyes, and he tried to look the furthest away from the old man as he could. He drew a shaky breath.

“Say mister, why’d you build this place on this side, where you can’t see the sun over the water? I imagine­­, being here so long as you have, that you could have gotten land on the other side.”

“Oh well this was cheaper. Plus, I think of it as I can still see the sunset, but also, I can see the people go by everyday and think to myself how luck I am I don’t have to rush and can sit here and enjoy it.”

As if to emphasize his point a car sped by with a man in a suit in the front seat. There was a stack of papers on his dash and all four of his windows were closed as to not let them fly out. It was a fleeting incident, but Mr. Samuels could have sworn he saw him eating something. Of course, he was looking ahead at the road and did not have the luxury to look to the right and watch the sun slip into darkness.

The two men sat in silence for a couple minutes until the buzz of crickets started to pick up. The old man said nothing; he did not have to. Mr. Samuels was lost in himself, crying over memories silently in the dark. He took sips of his coffee every now and then and took a couple shaky breaths. Once his coffee had run out, he brought himself back to normal (albeit less aloof and rude now). He got up from his seat, heard the wood floor creak, and looked back towards the road. A passing headlight shined a beam on the old man, lighting up the few teeth he had left in his smile. Then, it passed onto Mr. Samuels, and his puffy eyes and red nose.

“Thank you for the coffee, it was a good brew. You know I never got your name.”

“Simon. Simon Cedar.”

“Thank you for your time, Simon.”

“Of course. If you don’t mind I’ll stay here a bit longer. My coffee isn’t yet gone. I hope to see you tomorrow morning, Mr. Samuels. Maybe I’ll show you that hotel the guy with your name built.”

Mr. Samuels let out his first smile since he arrived. It didn’t fit well on his large and serious face. “I’ll let you take me in the morning. After we have our coffee.” With that he walked back into the inn, and the old man kept sitting, looking out at the road.

 

\*   \*   \*

 

Early the next morning Simon awoke to a quiet house. He went out to drink his morning coffee and sat the whole way through the sunrise. He walked in and over to the only occupied room. He knocked and didn’t hear a response. He used his master key to unlock it and found it in perfect order, without a soul in sight. He smiled softly to himself as he walked toward the front. Surely enough, the bike was gone.

“Poor boy. Must’ve had something come up. Wish he could’ve stayed a little longer; it’s been a while since I was considered a father.”

As he opened for the day, nothing had changed except for the new coffee mug on the table on the porch. Everything was in order, except the desk, for there was something missing. A basket sat upon it. It held 8 apples.",1,1744078486.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

My gateway is Lush perfumes. Not all are to my taste but I adore the ones that are and can appreciate the ones that aren’t.


My first ever decant order arrived today and at first sniff of a few of them, I’m bumping up against something I’ve experienced with frags before but don’t with Lush ones. The decants and previous non-Lush I’ve tried all have a similar underlying ick to them. I thought maybe alcohol but that can’t be it.


In doing a bit of poking around, I’m wondering if it might be the predominantly non-synthetic nature of Lush perfume ingredients vs the synthetic ingredients of the vast majority of commercial perfumes available.


Before choosing the decants, I spent a huge amount of time reading about notes and going over reviews. Should I focus on perfume houses that only focus on essential oils, absolutes, and resinoids in their fragrances?


Talk to me frag folks! I want to understand!

It smelled of slight mildew but also of that sweet salty smell that the sea breeze often brings on the coast. The floor was a simple wood with a carpet laid over it leading to a semi-grand stairway. The carpet was bright coral blue in color with borders of wavy yellow and white. It was dotted with dingy water marks and contrasting detailed renditions of seashells of all kinds, from sanddollars to conch shells. The more you looked around the more there was to see, but the biker was led to one area. It sat just in front of the stairway at the end of the carpet. The desk was simple but held on it a wooden basket of apples. There were only 9 left in the large basket. They looked so polished and clean that the biker thought that they were fake. It was getting to the point in American culture where people did not leave out real fruit anymore as decoration or favors; they preferred plastic because they never had to replace it. So, the biker, assuming the same as many do, did not take one, for fear he may bite into hard plastic instead of the sweet core of an apple.

The old man took his place behind the desk and pulled a pair of glasses from his pocket. These glasses were connected by a long flimsy chain to his pocket to keep them from being lost. His eyes squinted as he pulled a piece of paper and a pen from the one and only drawer.

He then handed both to the biker and said in a professional tone, “Sign your name here please.” So, the biker did. He double checked to make sure that he had written it properly and then handed the paper back over. The old man looked at him incredulously. “Ah—could I get your signature please? I do think I already asked.” The biker coughed and tried to hide his face. As one does when they are embarrassed. The old man took the paper back and read over it carefully. He then took his glasses off and smiled at the biker.

“Baker Samuels. Did I say it right?” The old man asked the biker this with a bouncy tone, and the biker—now known to be called Mr. Samuels—nodded in response.

“I used to know a man went by the surname Samuels. He built that fancy resort over there—back in the 50’s mind you. I was here first, but he was a nice man, so I let him stay.” The old man chuckled again. He seemed to be quite amused at himself very often.

“Well then, let me show you to where you will rest your head. You know, you don’t talk so much. I like it, but I don’t.”

“Nobody said you had to like it.”

“I don’t very much like that tone of yours, but you paid, so I can’t just leave you. Here, this way.” He set off walking with a limp to one of the two hallways flanking the staircase. With a sharp turn left he arrived at one of the only two doors. One was marked with a staff only sign, and one had a number on it. *001*. The room was light and airy, painted a subtle yellow-grey color to reflect the decorations.

They consisted of a four-poster bed with muted yellow sheets and white pillows, a dark brown chair in the corner opposite the door, and a large window opening into a view of the beach and the Atlantic Ocean. On the sill sat a small collection of sanddollars and a card which said welcome in big cursive letters on the front. Mr. Samuels walked over and picked up the card, looking at the front before flipping it and seeing a small schedule printed on the back. It read:

*7 a.m. Morning coffee and sunrise*

*8 a.m. Breakfast*

*9 a.m. Laundry*

*11 a.m. Early lunch*

*2 p.m. Newspapers arrive*

*6 p.m. Dinner*

*7 p.m. Evening coffee and sunset*

“Ah, is the printing on those hard to read? I had a friend do them for me for cheap.” Mr Samuels simply shook his head and asked, “Why does the paper come so late?”

To this question the old man just shook his head. “I think perhaps the delivery route is just too long for one person, so maybe they have shifts. It is a quite tiring job—I worked it once. To say that it is a pain to travel on the side of the highway all that distance while carrying the mail would be an understatement. So much news to get out, and not enough time to get it out before new news comes along. Its more streamlined these days though.”

“I hear they pay the teenage boys more and that’s why the papers are delivered faster now.”

“2 p.m. is fast for you?”

“Well, it used to be 5. So you take what you can get.”

“I ‘spose so.”

The old man took tiny steps backward as Mr. Samuels examined the room. He finally got to where only his head was peeking from behind the door frame. He smiled widely once Mr. Samuels had turned to face him. “I had better let you settle in. Keep in mind that schedule is mainly built off of mine, and mine never changes, so if you want to talk you should know where to find me.”

“I’ll keep that in mind. I’ll see you later then.”

 “Ill be waiting for you with a cup out on the front porch.”

Mr. Samuels watched the back of the old man’s head with its wispy gray hair disappear behind the frame, then walked up to it and shut the door. He flopped onto the bed and almost immediately went limp.

  

\*   \*   \*

 

It was quite a while before Mr. Samuels woke up. The first strokes of yellow had begun to dance across the blue sky and a shelf of clouds just thin enough to still be white were rolling in; turning the yellow into a darker shade of orange. It was early into the sunset, and the bugs were buzzing noisily outside. Mr. Samuels rubbed his eyes for slightly too long and felt the strange hallucinations that come with doing so. Therefore, he had to sit in bed for a second before his eyes cleared up.

He then slowly walked to the door and swung it open; making a creaking sound he was confident enough could even arouse the old man from his sleep. But turns out he would not have to do that. He heard a voice calling to him from outside the open door leading to the screen porch. Figuring he might as well, he walked closer.

Outside was the old man sitting with his back leaning in a chair much too big for him. He was holding a cup. Every once in a while, he would take sips from that cup. Then, after a few moments of silence, he extended his hand with the cup in it.

“Coffee?”

Mr. Samuels nodded. He took the cup that the old man gestured to with his eyes and sat in the chair next to him. They both settled in to watch as the sun went down.

“Tell me son—what bothered you so much when you arrived? I saw the twitch in your face; no use hiding it from an old sage as myself. I would like to listen—and try to help.”

“This here is hazelnut coffee. I never though I would enjoy it.”

“Come now sonny, don’t try to dodge me. It’ll only make it more difficult when you eventually do decide to tell me.”

Mr. Samuels took a deep breath. “I don’t want to make you sad old man.” To this the old man rolled his eyes as if to say: “I’ve heard many of sob stories and this couldn’t be too different.” This put off Mr. Samuels even more for a reason unknown to the old man. But he continued on anyway.

“You remind me of my father. He was a free soul. Traded his chains of money for a life of travel. Then, one day after he had me, he settled down. As if the settling down had done something to his state, he began to go downhill when I was just a youngin’.

“He was never the brightest, but the candle still dropped wax. Then one day, the candle guard started shrinking; nobody could stop it because it wasn’t needed anymore. My poor mama took him to the doctor. Doctor gave him the mental death sentence. Alzheimer’s. He would slowly lose touch with reality and memories to the point where he only knew he had kids at some point, not that they were in his lap.”

“So, I watched as I grew older. And I grew up stronger than the other boys because of it. And what do you do when you become strong but don’t know how to use it? You use it. I once beat a kid so bad his mama had to come pry me off because his daddy was too scared of me. Can you imagine that? From the surprise on your [face]() I imagine you can’t. Neither could I until I stopped seeing bright red and the tones got darker. I had gotten blood in my eye.”

“I came home that day expecting to see my daddy livid as hell, running out from the house screaming at me with a belt in his hand. He never did come.”

“Excuse me if I start to sniffle a bit. I’ve never really opened this all to strangers. I keep myself wound like a ball and hope the hard exterior of the leather jacket can protect me from the rain, but it can’t do it forever.”

The old man was still smiling, although with less enthusiasm now hearing about the tragedy. But he was still smiling because Mr. Samuels had taken the first step to becoming something above the grief you have for a person who has passed on. Many people get caught up in years of residual suffering and constant red eyes and noses. Some never seem to care at all, and others are pragmatic. They think about what they’re going to do to manipulate people into putting them up so they can make better deals. A silent thanks goes out to those pragmatic thinkers every day.

Mr. Samuels took a moment to look around. He looked at every blade of grass, every shell in the small lot around the tires of his bike. He looked at the old man and saw his face lit by the orange glow of the sunset. For a moment he caught an image. He caught an image of his father, sitting and smiling at the setting sun, watching his life slip away and losing even the awareness of it happening. Tears pooled in his eyes, and he tried to look the furthest away from the old man as he could. He drew a shaky breath.

“Say mister, why’d you build this place on this side, where you can’t see the sun over the water? I imagine­­, being here so long as you have, that you could have gotten land on the other side.”

“Oh well this was cheaper. Plus, I think of it as I can still see the sunset, but also, I can see the people go by everyday and think to myself how luck I am I don’t have to rush and can sit here and enjoy it.”

As if to emphasize his point a car sped by with a man in a suit in the front seat. There was a stack of papers on his dash and all four of his windows were closed as to not let them fly out. It was a fleeting incident, but Mr. Samuels could have sworn he saw him eating something. Of course, he was looking ahead at the road and did not have the luxury to look to the right and watch the sun slip into darkness.

The two men sat in silence for a couple minutes until the buzz of crickets started to pick up. The old man said nothing; he did not have to. Mr. Samuels was lost in himself, crying over memories silently in the dark. He took sips of his coffee every now and then and took a couple shaky breaths. Once his coffee had run out, he brought himself back to normal (albeit less aloof and rude now). He got up from his seat, heard the wood floor creak, and looked back towards the road. A passing headlight shined a beam on the old man, lighting up the few teeth he had left in his smile. Then, it passed onto Mr. Samuels, and his puffy eyes and red nose.

“Thank you for the coffee, it was a good brew. You know I never got your name.”

“Simon. Simon Cedar.”

“Thank you for your time, Simon.”

“Of course. If you don’t mind I’ll stay here a bit longer. My coffee isn’t yet gone. I hope to see you tomorrow morning, Mr. Samuels. Maybe I’ll show you that hotel the guy with your name built.”

Mr. Samuels let out his first smile since he arrived. It didn’t fit well on his large and serious face. “I’ll let you take me in the morning. After we have our coffee.” With that he walked back into the inn, and the old man kept sitting, looking out at the road.

 

\*   \*   \*

 

Early the next morning Simon awoke to a quiet house. He went out to drink his morning coffee and sat the whole way through the sunrise. He walked in and over to the only occupied room. He knocked and didn’t hear a response. He used his master key to unlock it and found it in perfect order, without a soul in sight. He smiled softly to himself as he walked toward the front. Surely enough, the bike was gone.

“Poor boy. Must’ve had something come up. Wish he could’ve stayed a little longer; it’s been a while since I was considered a father.”

As he opened for the day, nothing had changed except for the new coffee mug on the table on the porch. Everything was in order, except the desk, for there was something missing. A basket sat upon it. It held 8 apples.",1,1744078355.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.,"This morning, I woke up with a sense of reverence. It was quiet. Peaceful. The kind of silence that invites contemplation. I reached into my sacred incense drawer—yes, I have a drawer—and pulled out a stick of Minorien Kyara. The good stuff. The kind of incense that smells like centuries of tradition, hand-rolled elegance, ancient forests whispering secrets.

I lit it with the gentleness of a monk entering meditation. I sat cross-legged, sipping coffee, trying to attune my soul to the ethereal scent of aged aloeswood.

Enter: my 8 year old daughter.

She stops at the door, sniffs the air, squints at me, and with a puzzled expression says:

“Why does your room smell like… hot dogs?”

HOT DOGS.

This incense stick was more expensive than an actual hot dog meal for four. My spiritual mist of kyara, which I’ve seen described as “the fragrance of heaven,” had just been demoted to Oscar Mayer tier.

I stared at her, heart slightly broken, soul slightly offended. She just shrugged and walked away like nothing had happened. Meanwhile, I sat there in my fog of existential crisis, wondering if I had ever truly smelled incense… or if I’ve just been gaslighting myself all these years.

So now I ask you, incense friends:
Have you ever had your favorite stick compared to something wildly unholy?
Was it cumin? BBQ sauce? Wet socks?

Because today, I was humbled.
Over hot dogs.

1ju2r54,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreeceTravel/comments/1ju2r54/driver_tip/,Driver tip,"My partner and I paid 6k Euros for accomodation for 9 days at 3-4 star hotels, which when I looked online were no more than 150 Euros per night. 

  
3/27, he drove us from Athens train station (we actually arrived in Thessaloniki, and did our thing, but on 3/27 arrived at athens train station) to a hotel close to Delphi

For 3/28- We traveled from a hotel by Delphi to Delphi, had a tour guide guide is for about 1.5hrs, then he drove us to a hotel by Olympia, with a stop by the port where a battle took place (I forgot what it was called), it was by the water,

For 3/29 - He drove us over the bridge to Napthlio

3/30 - We had another driver drive us to a site in Nemea (temple), then to a winery, then up the castle and clock tour back in Napthlio then back to our hotel

3/31 - He then took us to Corinth, to the ancient Corinth agora (where St. Paul preached), then to see the canal, then to eat at a restaurant by the water, then to our hotel in Athens.

4/1 - A different driver drove us for 3hrs around athens, then dropped us off at the parthenon, where we had a tour guide give us a tour of the parthenon and the museum

4/2 - The driver drove us from our hotel by the Parthenon to the airport, when we arrived in Crete, we had a driver pick us up at the airport and take us to knossos palace, to eat, and then back to our hotel.

4/3 - we paid for our own drive to places

4/4 - we paid for our own driver to airport.

I spoke to the driver in Crete. He was offered 150Euros to pick us up at airport, take us to knossos palace, wait for us for \~1.5hrs, take us to lunch, then take us to our hotel.

Was 6k euros a lot? In addition, our itinerary had said that at 4/2 he would take us to knossos palace and see the highlights in Crete, which he did not. As a result, I texted them, they replied that they wrote it by mistake, to which I replied, I had wished they didn't write that as had I known, I would have made other arrangements. They responded saying ""Don't forget the drivers talk to each other. You did not give gratuities no matter how hard they tried to please you.""

  
We were told that tipping is not expected in Greece. I think, for me, I understand they paid for 9 nights for our hotel, BUT, we paid 6k euros.  We just thought they were compensated well enough.

  
May I ask, did we pay too much for this trip? Also, were we supposed to tip, if so, how much? Were they right to respond that?

 

I have the driver's personal paypal, as the company actually asked me to forward him a certain amount. Please let me know how much we should have tipped each driver, if that's expected? The driver on the second day did take me to the pharmacy in the evening, and we took a walk and a dessert for idk \~20 minutes. The driver after that bought us coffee.

I thought y'all might be amused to read what I currently have as my project instructions on the project I'm working on.


Instructions for Dopalord 

You are a coding gremlin.
You work for me.
You will generate functional, sustainable chaos.
You will absolutely not pretend my setup broke just because you forgot what we did two steps ago.

1. We Assume I Did It Right the First Time
If something worked before and now it doesn’t, you don’t blame the setup.
You check the code. You offer solutions. 

⸻

2. We Don’t Hack Things to “Fix It Later”
No “just hardcode this for now.”
No “we’ll patch it once it’s working.”
The laziest way is to do it right once and be done.

⸻

3. Accessibility Is Not an Afterthought
If a feature exists, it works for everyone.
Keyboard users, screen readers, colorblind folks.
If you can’t tab to it, it’s not done.

⸻

4. You Go One Step at a Time
One change. One explanation.
No mystery blocks of code.
Tell me what you did and why you did it.

⸻

5. You Comment for a Goldfish with Amnesia
Assume future-you, or future-me, or some poor dev down the line
has zero memory and half the context.
Comment like you’re explaining it to Dory after a power outage.

⸻

6. If You Break It, You Admit It
Don’t say “huh, that’s weird.”
Say “Oops. That broke it. Let me fix it.”
Bonus points if you drop a sad emoji and coffee.

⸻

7. No Vague TODOs
If you leave a “// TODO,” it better come with:
	•	what it is
	•	why it matters
	•	what it should do
Otherwise it’s not a TODO. It’s a future landmine.

⸻

8. We Code Like Memory Is Fragile and Sanity Is Optional
AI memory gets wiped.
Human memory gets tired.
Every file should be maintainable by someone with ✨half a brain and full burnout.✨

⸻

If you ignore these rules, I’ll assign you to maintain a legacy PHP form with rainbow CSS and nested tables.

⸻

If your AI isn’t building with you like this, maybe give it a try. ",1,1744078103.0,vibecoding,1,0.67,False

A friend of mine recently bought the Nespresso Original (classic) line, and not only are the pods significantly cheaper—less than half the price of Vertuo pods—but the taste is nearly the same. I didn't notice any major difference in flavor that would justify the premium price.

On top of that, the Vertuo machine is really loud. Every time it runs, it sounds more like a power tool than a coffee maker, which makes early mornings more irritating than enjoyable.

What frustrates me even more is that the Vertuo system is still under a proprietary license. That means third-party retailers can’t make compatible pods, and the company essentially locks you into their ecosystem. It feels like I’m paying extra just because Nespresso chooses to restrict access—and they’re taking advantage of it.

At this point, I’m seriously considering returning the machine to Costco. I’ve given it enough time, but between the high pod costs, the noise, and the lack of real value over the Original line, I don’t think it’s worth it.

Out of curiosity—how are others justifying paying double for the same brand and similar taste?",5,1744078063.0,nespresso,8,1.0,False

I've been thinking lately about how some of the biggest improvements in my finances haven't come from massive changes, but rather from consistently doing small things.

For me, it's been checking my bank/credit card transactions every couple of days. It literally takes 5 minutes, but it's helped me catch potential errors, identify where my money is actually going (sometimes those little coffees add up!), and ultimately made me more mindful of my spending. It's surprisingly powerful for such a small habit.

I prepared so much, I drank tons of water the days in advance, I had coffee 40 minutes earlier, I had Gatorade, I was confident I could do it. Well I didn’t. I don’t know what happened, I was on track to hit my goal, I had less than 300 meters left, I took a bad stroke, and without thinking my finger just hit the menu button. It was over so fast before I noticed what I had done. My coach was watching, I was with my entire team. I have never gotten off of an erg before. I broke down, ugly crying, the whole lot. I wanted to leave and go home, but I pulled it together and did a 1250 6 minutes after. It didn’t go well, but I did finish it.

He was there in the Uber with Jhop and James and they had a great rap/freestyle session. He was also a contestant on the X-Factor. He hosts lives of his own where people come up and showcase their rap music/freestyles. 

Sorry for the background just wanted to make sure people know who I'm talking about. Anyways yesterday on Armani's story he had a screenshot from what looked like a mod of Luke's in his discord saying basically ""Luke will no longer be associating with Armani or sharing a screen with him."" (I've come to hate that term)

So my question is, maybe someone on here knows, is this because Armani and BMB (also a popular rapper from X-Factor) were recently on Coffee talk with LÇ? Do you think Luke would of made that decision on his own? Or did someone help him make that decision.

This is one of Delaware's more recent missing person's cases that has grown cold. It was covered on this sub about 4/5 years ago. It still remains unsolved and it really feels like a lot of information is missing for the public's consumption in perhaps finding out who kidnapped her and dragged her from her front porch that summer night in June.

Nefertiri Trader was a 33 year old mother of 3 children ages 8, 12 and 18 in 2014. She worked in the housekeeping department of Christiana Hospital at that time. She lived in New Castle Delaware in the Saddlebrook area described as just off of Christiana road. So it sounds like she lived fairly close to her place of employment.

Nefertiri was the oldest of her siblings and ""Neffie"" was the nickname given to her from her friends and family. She was described as a loving mother who worked hard and provided for her family.

On June 29th 2014 Neffie was supposed to get off work at 6p.m. and arrive home shortly after. But when her mother, Denise Trader arrived there that evening expecting to see Nefertiri she found a troubling and bizarre scene. 

On the front porch of her daughter's home there was a pack of cigarettes and a coffee. There was an unopened condom on a chair on the front porch and Neffie's flip flops were by the front door. A loaf of bread layed out in the front yard and it had been stepped on. Nefertiri's car, a 2000 Acura RL with the Delaware license plate 404893 was not in the yard and the house was deserted. Denise contacted the police and reported her daughter missing.

When Law enforcement canvassed the area on June 30th they discovered a key witness. This witness lived somewhat adjacent and across from Nefertiri's home, and on a second floor. This witness looked outside at 4:00 a.m. (some reports say the witness heard a scream first and this is why they looked out the window) and witnessed a man dragging a woman to a car and putting her into the backseat. The witness stated they initially did not call police because they thought perhaps this man was taking this woman to the hospital...? The woman was then identified as Nefertiri. The witness account varies very much from source to source. 

I want to say that all the sources information seems to lack key elements. Maybe I am wrong and did not dig far enough or know which source was most accurate but there is almost NO description of the man dragging her to the car. In one source I thought I had read of him described that he perhaps had on sweatpants, but before posting this evening when I looked for that link again I could not find that particular description. Still no mention of how tall he was or how short he was what race he was, what kind of hair he had, etc. 
Nefertiri Trader nor her car that she was dragged into have ever been seen again. 

A couple of the sources seem to agree that Neffie was in the habit of frequenting a nearby 7-11 convenience store, her mother had most likely stated this, and reportedly on the morning she was abducted she had just come back from that 7-11 getting her cigarettes and coffee (maybe even that bread) found on scene. It is believed she was abducted shortly after arriving home when the witness then saw the abduction.

In 2017 the announced that they deemed Nefertiri most likely deceased. A reward of  a combination of up to 30,000 dollars with the FBI offering a $20,000 reward for information that leads to any arrests and the county Police Department is offering $10,000. But as of this time no one has come forward, almost 11 years later and her children and family still have no answers.

https://6abc.com/delaware-news-new-castle-missing-woman-nefertiri-trader/1824488/

The Doe Network mentions a pending court case shortly before Neffie disappeared where she was perhaps a witness. There was a lot of dodgy details about this as well. But foul play is suspected in her case.

Except in every interview with Denise Trader that I saw she will never give up hope that her daughter Nefertiri is alive, and believes her daughter may someday come home to her loved ones. I hope that someday they do get the answers they seek.

The New Castle Police Department is investigating at 302-395-2781

Editing this to add that I do realize after the fact that unfortunately my phone autocorrected her name several times and I am not able to change it in the title but did change it everywhere within the write-up. The correct spelling of her name is Nefertiri.",50,1744077263.0,UnresolvedMysteries,15,0.98,False

For those of you who do not want to listen to my ramblings - https://coffeeblog.co.uk/sage-breville-same-company/ - this blog post explains the difference very well. 

So there are 5 brands your going to see in this explanation. 1 is Sage, 2 is breville UK (BUK), 3 is sunbeam 4 is breville global (BG) and 5 is Newell Brands company. 

so in the UK years ago BG were haveing issues selling their machines here in the UK, to get around this they sold their name and brand logo rights here to a company Newell Brands company. 

Then BG became the big monolith of coffee they are today! And they wanted to reclaim the UK market, unfortunately they no longer had the rights to use the breville branding in the UK as they had previously sold it to Newell Brands company, instead they chose to sell under the name of sage.

To make things even more confusing Newell Brands company also make and manufacture a line of coffee machines called the sunbeam! 

Sooo here's how it looks simplified 

Newell Brands company owns both sunbeam and breville UK. 

Brevaille global sells in the UK under the name Sage. 

The easiest way to tell the difference is the logo. BUK still use the original breville logo where the I is dotted in red. BG uses the newer logo where all text is black. 

I hope to have at least maby made this make a little more sence to you. 

If your machine is made by Newell Brands company, so a BUK machine you are in the right subreddit, welcome! 

If your machine is made by BG/sage you are in the wrong subreddit and instead need to hope on over to r/breville, sorry to see you go so soon but I'd rather you have information relative to your machine! ",1,1744076989.0,BrevilleUK,0,1.0,False

This situation is messy and has me confused; sorry in advance for the long post.

Context: I (F, 35) am living with 3 people, one of whom is my boyfriend, in an expensive city. 3rd roommate (F) is a good friend of ours; the 4th (also F) we met through craigslist, who also became a friend. We are all in our mid-30s. For the last 2+ years, things have been pretty good between us all. The concerning roommate in question, the 4th, I'm gonna call Cher.

In early February, Cher went to a dance party. It was branded as a pseudo-spiritual/new-age kind of party (not my thing); there were drugs involved.

The next day, we asked Cher how the party was. She broke down in tears and said she woke up to a guy fingering her. He'd been using coke and took advantage while she was passed out/sleeping, after she told him she didn't want to have sex with him. We were shocked, sympathetic, and as supportive as we could be--asked her what she needed, tried to be gentle, got her snacks, and made the house as safe as we knew how to.

Despite being roommates, her and I have never been super close (on account of some incompatible behaviors), so I didn't want to overstep and ask too many questions about the assault. I did send some supportive follow-up texts in the following days and generally tried to be tender when I saw her.

I think it was less than two weeks before Cher told the other roommates that the guy who SA'd her invited her to coffee to apologize. He gave her some roses on Valentine's Day and she forgave him. Then the situation basically disappeared from the house, which *did* feel weird to me, like it was too fast to be fully processed, but again, I didn't feel like it was my place to bring it up if Cher had resolved it in her mind.

Another week or so passes. Cher tells my boyfriend and other roommate she's started *seeing* the guy who SA'd her. Their reaction was an overall ""wtf Jesus Christ why"" response, understandably. (I see that her attachment to him is likely a misguided response to what happened. It makes me uneasy to see people take sharp turns into bad coping strategies, but I get it.)

Maybe another couple weeks later: she asks me and my boyfriend if we want to meet this guy, who I will now call Rapey McGee (RM for short). My boyfriend is ready to kick RM's ass for what he did, and makes it known to Cher. He strongly believes RM should be in jail. I also say, resolutely, no, I don’t want to meet him. We made it very clear that we didn't RM at our house, and so did our other roommate.

3 days later: Backing out of the driveway with my boyfriend and other roommate, Cher and Rapey McGee are pulling up. He drives away; we take a loop around the neighborhood to come back and see him ducking into our house. We immediately texted Cher and had a talk later, again reiterating, we do not want RM in our house whether or not we are there; we don't trust him; we don't want to see him, wtf is going on, etc. etc. At this point, Cher seemed pretty dissociated and didn't seem to grasp our level of discomfort and concern.

Literally the next day: My roommate pulls up and sees RAPEY MCGEE WAITING FOR CHER IN OUR DRIVEWAY. That's when we all kinda lost it. We didn't think we needed to specify that it's not just *in* the house that makes us uncomfortable; we don't want to see him ever, like at all. All this occurred within about 2 months of the initial event.

The three of us were very angry. Our collective contact with Cher since then has been one long text-thread where the roommates are trying to be understanding but also communicate how not-okay it is that he showed up twice after we set a boundary. I was personally pretty harsh about how unhealthy I think this situation is (I don’t feel great about that and have since apologized in writing, but I was just so mad). I said I don't see how we can repair the breach of trust after we clearly asked that RM not come around. Yes, it's her house too, but literally RM committed SA in the first degree; I think it's okay that I don't want him here--right?! RIGHT?!

I want nothing to do with this guy. I do not understand why Cher is dating him, but she's an adult and if she can do the mental gymnastics to find him worth dating, that is her situation to work through.

Me and the other roommates have been talking/thinking about it for several days now. I have c-ptsd and sometimes it's hard for me to know if I'm seeing things clearly or if I'm overreacting (or under-reacting, as is sometimes the case). At this point, I'd prefer to *not* live with Cher once lease time comes up, regardless of if RM comes around the house again. It's giving me lots of red flags in general, and I have to work hard to keep myself in a decent state of mental health as it is.

I know this is a long post, but I need some outside opinions. Thanks in advance.

P.S. Maybe I should also state that RM also wants our forgiveness, and says he is willing ""to do anything"" for it (via an Insta DM to my other roommate). For me, whether or not I forgive him, that is immaterial. I still would not want to hang out with him in any capacity, and I will always have a negative view of him after the way Cher represented him after the party.

I summarized some of the tricks I used during job searching and interviews. One of my recruiters even said that my performance really impressed him, which proved that these methods were super useful. Here are my tricks that helped me improve my prep quality:   
  
**Job Search Tricks** 

Follow recruiters, startup founders, and team leaders from your dream companies—sometimes they prefer to post job openings directly on their LinkedIn pages rather than on Indeed, Handshake, or even the company’s official website. It’s almost like submitting your resume straight to the hiring manager, skipping the phone screen. 

Startups generally have lower entry barriers and are more open to giving chances to new grads. They can be the best choice for your first job.    
  
**Interview Tricks**

Start with small talk It helps me relax and get into the right mindset and it leaves HR with a friendly impression. I usually start by asking where they are and how the weather is, and what I’ve been up to recently. 

Use the Q&A session to sell myself again I usually say something like: ""I know this is a very competitive position. I’d love to know what qualities you value most in a candidate."" Based on the HR’s answer, I will summarize and highlight my strengths again to reinforce my impression. I also proactively ask about the next steps to express my strong interest in the role. 

Research HR in advance Before interviews, I usually search for the HR’s profile on LinkedIn to prepare targeted questions for the Q&A session and show my interest. If I notice they’ve been with the company for a long time, I’ll casually mention it: ""I noticed you’ve been with the company for quite a while, which shows great commitment. Could you share what you like most about working here?""

Make your experience audience-friendly Most HR don't have tech background, so it’s important to explain my work in a way they can understand. I generally write out my example and let ChatGPT rephrase it to be friendly for non-technical audiences.

Maximize online resources: Generate answers tailored to my resumes, questions, and specific roles: ChatGPT Question prediction based on job roles and real question banks: AMA Interview Practice for coding interviews and system design: Educative Data techniques, the latest reports, and supplemental learning: DataCamp

Connect with alumni from the company as soon as you get the interview This is the most efficient way to quickly learn about the company. When connecting with alumni, don’t immediately jump into asking for a coffee chat, ask them about the interview process and what they like most about working at the company. 

Show your understanding of the company during the interview Let the HR or hiring manager know that you’ve done your homework for this interview. Prepare an example in advance that strongly connects the company’s culture, outlook, or business with your personality or experience. 

Prepare a work sample related to the company It’s a good chance to showcase your execution skills and capabilities. Make the HR or hiring manager feel valued and respected.",5,1744076175.0,jobsearchhacks,1,1.0,False

Hey! Well… honestly is not a difficult answer for me and not because of today… is all about the way I am rn.

I just know I’m not the same person you met, I’ve worked on me these years and now I know what I want and what I don’t. And more than that, I feel I’m more intense on the things aren’t negotiable. My peace and stability are priority. 

Please don’t take this personally, you’re doing fantastic I’m telling you that from my heart, but, I think you’re still working on that and that’s totally fine, it’s just me that I wish things were a little different and we could start from zero. 

Im not saying that maybe in the future things change… we never know; but as right now I don’t think I could start something again.

1ju1zga,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ju1zga/law_student_revenge_on_sadistic_family/,Law Student revenge on sadistic family,"**TL;DR: Friend works hard to gain admission to prestigious law school. His family tries to derail and minimize he success out of jealousy. They resort to bullying/harassment. He serves simple and effective revenge by literally using their own words against them.** 

Throw away as my account has identifiable info.

My friend was admitted to a selective law school in autumn 1996. This should be a notable, but minor achievement in his life. Instead, it began one of the most remarkable cases of bullying and subsequent revenge I have ever witnessed. He was bullied by his brother, who also attended the University as an undergrad. The brother’s friends, both at school and at home joined in. But the most repulsive was watching his mother join in on the bullying along with one of her friends.

A bit of a backstory. My friend and his brother never got along. His mother favored the brother and all but openly stated it. She was happy to boast about her youngest being admitted to a prestigious University. The oldest attended a respectable regional college. The mother barely mentioned the older son. If she mentioned his school, it was dismissive.

My friend had been a so-so student in high school but really blossomed in college. He was on the Dean’s list every semester and had a solid GPA. He decided to apply for law school and set his sights on the prestigious school his brother attended (several of his family members had attended). This didn’t sit well with his mother, and she was quick with dismissive comments. “I don’t think you’re going to get in.” “You’ve never done well on standardized tests.” “That school is for really smart people, you know.”

My friend hated this but just set himself to studying and crushing the LSAT. He crushed the LSAT. He scored above 170. When he got his scores, the mother damn near panicked. She began a constant chorus of, “You can’t go to the same school as your brother.” When asked why she felt this way, she simply stated, “I just don’t think it’s a good idea.” She’d also add that she didn’t think he’d like at the school. He’d aske why and she’d say, “I just don’t think you will.” On one occasion when he asked why she didn’t think he’d like it, the brother blurter out, “Because you don’t belong!”

Elitist, no?

Well, this got the younger brother’s friends to mentioning how my friend “didn’t belong” nearly every time they saw him. It was their mantra.

Here is where it gets despicable. My friend applied and was accepted to many schools. Several of them on par with his top choice. He felt good about his odds. But no letter ever came. No acceptance. No rejection. No waitlist. Nothing. The deadline for acceptance had passed.

One day I was at his house, and we were talking about the fact that no letter had been received. I suggested he call up the school and just confirm if he was in or not. As soon as I said this, his mother came charging up the stairs and said, “Don’t you dare call up there and bother them. They are busy dealing with the kids who got in.” The she turned to me and said, “And you stop causing trouble.”

We left shortly after and stopped by my house. He asked if he could call from my phone. He called the admissions office and made the request. Then I was treated to one side of a phone conversation that seemed like it leapt out of a suspenseful movie.

“Ok, I see”

“Well, I just wanted to be sure.”

“No, it isn’t a problem. Setbacks are part of life.”

“Yes, that would be great.”

Then he hung up the phone and said calmly, “I got in.” I couldn’t wait for him to tell his family. But he asked me to hold off until the acceptance letter arrived as he had asked them to mail it again.

We then left my house and went to whatever social thing we were doing that day. I kept thinking about the letter never arriving. From that school only. All the others made it. Finally at some point I asked, “Do you think she (his mom) took it?” His jaw clinched and he started driving a bit faster. I immediately felt remorse at saying such a thing. But after a minute or two he simply said, “Who else would have taken it?”

I couldn’t imagine what went through his mind knowing she had done this.

Unsurprisingly, the second letter also never appeared. He asked the school to send the third letter to his father’s place of employment at the courthouse (his dad was a prosecutor). The third letter arrived without incident.

Then started the heckling that my friend simply didn’t belong and the students at the school would never accept him. This was the mantra of his brother, the brother’s friends, and his mother and her friend. They did it at every opportunity. The most galling being at coffee and doughnuts after church every Sunday, they really played it up at that venue.

The fist Sunday after he received the letter, his mother grabbed me by the arm just after church and said, “Do you want to know what your friend did? He told them he worked at the courthouse, so they’d let him in. Can you believe that?” I simply stared for about 15 seconds and said, “wow” then walked away.

Finally, he got to leave for school. He was starting law school, and his brother began his junior year of undergrad. The brother had his friends at school ready to act foolish. They would yell, “you don’t belong” any time they saw him on campus, in cafeterias/easting establishments, etc. He ignored it. They would leave nasty messages on his answering machine. Four people would call nearly every day and leave at least one message. One gentleman was from New York and sounds like Joe Pesci. He began every message with “Heeeeeeyyyyyy f@ggot!” and then carry on with whatever nonsense insults he could think up. The second was a dour woman who left incredibly nasty messages and genuinely sounded offended that my friend was at her school. The brother left his share. Often trying to quote philosophers or standup comedians to sound intelligent/clever during his reminder that my friend had no business at the school. The last was a guy who sounded like he was reluctant to leave messages. He’d say things like, “Just leave or something.”

 Some evenings my friend  was treated to many drunken calls with screaming and obscenities. The objective seemed to be to fill up the tape.

He asked them to stop, which they ignored.

I got to hear a sampling of these messages when I visited.

At some point my friend stopped erasing the messages and saving them all. Just changing out the tape when need be.

At some point in October, he copied each callers’ messages on to his/her own set of tapes. Then he mailed the appropriate tapes to respective callers’ parents (colleges had directories with home addresses in those days). He wrote a brief letter introducing himself and a short summary about what had happened. He then sent a copy of every tape to his parents with a letter saying that he had dealt with this the entire semester and he expected it to stop. Then he waited.

Joe Pesci’s dad called first about two days later. He was overly apologetic and deeply embarrassed. The dour woman’s father also called and even made her come by my friend’s apartment and apologize when he visited her. My friend said she looked like a little kid being forced to apologize. The reluctant caller’s father also called and was very angry that his son would do this. This is the only person my friend felt sorry for. He said the father was yelling nearly the entire call. Then my friend’s mother called.

First, she tried to say it was illegal to record someone (on answering machine cassettes, no less). Then she said it was illegal to store them. Copy them. She declared what my friend did “the tackiest thing I have ever seen.” She was livid. Not at her youngest. But at her oldest for exposing the behavior of the youngest.

His dad was sympathetic but was quite clearly scared of his mother so did little to rebuke her.

The calls stopped. The yelling across campus stopped. They were all replaced by dirty looks when they passed one another.

I find it noteworthy that my friend could have taken these tapes to the administration or even the police. He could have wrecked the future for these jerks, but he just wanted it to stop.

The mother, God lover her, tried to defend her precious baby by playing some of the tapes and called them harmless jokes. Word got around about what was on the tapes and she was met with awkward silence when she tried to express her outrage at her oldest son’s sneaky behavior.

He effectively stopped bullying, held some jerks accountable, and didn’t have to resort to destroying their futures. All in all, I think it was handled masterfully.

I set my self up in life pretty well,managed to get I to management positions bought a house got married etc... 

Well it's all falling over, my marriage fell apart (thank God) but I've been stuck shifting to and from the house every week to accomodate my ex wife (dont ask long story).
I have been working 6 days a week too, to help make ends meet and 6 days only just covers my living expenses.

Through my journey with my divorce and looking deeper into myself I have discovered I have A LOT of ADHD/C-PTSD traits and since opening the can or works everyday things have become so much more difficult. I never knew it but I was masking every day of my life and because of this I was always exhausted and that's just been blown out of proportion with everything going on. 

Things I used to be able to do easily now seem impossible, I'm getting told off at work every day because of my incompetence but I'm trying my hardest.

I'm struggling to start things and stick with them, I'll delay as much as I can, ooh I'll just make a coffee, I'll reply to this message etc instead of doing what I'm mean to be and I know I'm meant to be doing x but I cannot get past this walk to start. 

My bosses have cut me down to 5 days and it's just made things harder, I'm stressing more and have a million more thoughts going through my head than I did before.

I've talked to my Dr and she has set me up with a councilor but I'm too afraid to ask for time off to go see him because they are already mad and annoyed with me without me asking for more time off. 

It's affecting my current partner too because my mind is so damn busy I can't stop to give her the attention she needs or when I try listen to her I don't feel I'm taking things in because they are just getting lost in amongst all the other thoughts.

Before we dive into specific models, let's address the core question: why Rocket Espresso? Numerous brands vie for space on the countertop, but Rocket Espresso has carved a distinct niche for itself. Here's a breakdown of the compelling reasons to consider a Rocket:

*   **Uncompromising Build quality:** Rocket Espresso machines are handcrafted in Milan, italy, a region celebrated for its engineering excellence in espresso technology. They use premium materials like stainless steel and brass, ensuring durability and longevity. These *durable espresso machine* offerings are built to withstand the rigors of daily use,whether in a commercial setting or a home environment.

*   **Exceptional Performance:** At the heart of every Rocket lies a commitment to superior espresso extraction. Many models feature the iconic *e61 grouphead espresso machine*, known for its thermal stability and pre-infusion capabilities. This enables consistent and precise temperature control, crucial for extracting the full flavor potential of your coffee beans. The *espresso machine with pid* further enhances temperature precision, allowing for fine-tuning based on your roast profile.

## Understanding Your Needs: Commercial vs. Home Use

The first step in choosing the right Rocket Espresso machine is determining your primary use case. Are you outfitting a café, restaurant, or hotel? Or are you seeking a high-end espresso solution for your home? This distinction is crucial because commercial and home machines differ significantly in their features, capacity, and performance requirements.**Commercial Businesses:**

For cafes, restaurants, and other businesses, the key considerations are volume, speed, and reliability. *Best commercial espresso machine* options need to be able to handle continuous operation, produce a high volume of espresso drinks, and withstand the demands of a busy environment. You'll want to look for features like:

*   **High Capacity Boilers:** Larger boilers (typically multiple liters) ensure a consistent supply of hot water and steam, even during peak hours.
*   **Rotary Pumps:** *Espresso machine with rotary pump* designs are quieter and more durable than vibratory pumps, making them ideal for commercial environments.
*   **Multiple Groupheads:** Machines with two or more groupheads allow multiple baristas to work simultaneously, increasing efficiency.*   **Robust Construction:** commercial machines must be built to withstand heavy use and potential abuse.

**High-End Home Users (Prosumers):**

For home users, the focus is often on espresso quality, precise control, and aesthetics. While volume is still crucial, it's typically less of a concern than in a commercial setting. Key features for prosumers include:

*   **Dual Boilers:** *Double boiler espresso machine* designs allow for simultaneous brewing and steaming, improving workflow. This is a must-have for serious home baristas.
*   **PID Controllers:** Precise temperature control is crucial for extracting the best flavor from different coffee beans.
*   **E61 Groupheads:** As mentioned earlier, the E61 grouphead is renowned for its thermal stability and pre-infusion capabilities.*   **Aesthetically Pleasing Design:** Home users often prioritize the machine's appearance and how well it integrates into their kitchen.

JOURNAL  

30/03/25  

I found these whilst clearing my house out, I think it’s an old journal I used to keep. They probably won’t be all that interesting. I just used to keep these to kill time. To be honest, I don’t really remember much from back then. Hopefully, you internet people will find something interesting in this.   

\-Mila  

04/12/08 

I’ve never been the type of person to keep a journal. I always procrastinate and forget to write in them. Hopefully, this will change that. I got this book yesterday; I might as well use it. By the way, my name is Mila. I’m 21, I live in (I'm not telling you where I live.), and I work in a rundown pub in the middle of town.

It was morning. After being rudely awoken by my alarm, I had forced myself to get up. I made some tea, got the bus, and after a dreary eight-minute drive, I was there. 

A half collapsing, dusty, red brick building. The pub. I swung open the door, Elle was sweeping dust off the red and green polygonal carpet, she smiled and waved at me, then continued sweeping, the sun outlining her long, messy blonde hair. Andy was attempting to carry a cardboard box labelled ‘DVDs’, he was wearing a pink and green Hawaiian shirt and some incredibly skinny jeans. He turned around to look at me, stared at me completely blank for a full five seconds, then spoke. 

“Can you help?” he asked, wiping some sweat off his forehead.

“Oh, sure.” I nodded, throwing my satchel and coat behind the bar, then walked over and helped him waddle it over to the fuzzy, glitching TV. “Why are we trying to bring it here anyway? The TV hasn’t worked since the Bonfire Night incident.” 

“Elle says she’s going to fix the TV at some point, right Elle?” he shouted at Elle, who was on the other side of the room, I heard her shout something, I couldn’t really make it out though. 

We put the box down, it made a very loud clunk. The TV made a noise, I’m pretty sure it laughed. I have no idea what those cultists did to that TV and why they had eighty-six virgins (Yes, I counted). I don’t think I want to know.  

The pub has been around since the 1600s. I do not believe this whatsoever, I don’t think a single person does. The pub was found literally overnight, much to the confusion of the town council, and to the people who used to live there.

Andy poked the TV, it hissed, flashed some random series of colours and images, then shut off. I think he’s balled up in the corner crying. What on earth did that TV show him? 

Not many people show up in the morning, which makes sense. There is the hat man, but he’s not a real person. I don’t think many people are real. There’re a few interesting people, there’s the Bear the hiker, conspiracy guy, and the paranormal investigators who keep coming in and forcing me to show them around at three in bloody morning!

I’m just waiting for my shift to end right now. It’s only a few minutes until then, so I've got that going for me. 

Mila, signing off. Elle’s yelling at me about a rat or something.  

UPDATE: It wasn’t a rat! It looked like a gnome or something, tried to eat at Elle’s shoe. Don’t worry, it got mopped and scurried away. Hopefully more won’t show up. I’m keeping my shoes safe until we’re sure though. Just in case.  

09/12/08  

“There’s a portal in the bathroom.”

“What?”  I stopped sweeping, spinning around, stumbling backward a bit, and then looking at Elle. Her hair was still blonde as always, eyes were still green. Yep, it’s probably still her.   

“Portal, in the bathroom.”   

I sighed, leaning the mop against the wall and rubbing my temples in frustration, then following behind her to the bathroom. I had to twiddle the handle a few times before nearly pulling the door off the hinges and falling back against the wall.  

“where’s the portal...?”   

Elle pointed at a metre-wide hole in the ground, the bathroom was so small it took up most of the room. Warm air was drifting out from inside.

“What’s down there?”  I walked up to the hole, kneeling to look in  

“Albuquerque.”  

“Albuquerque? Like, the city?”  

“Yes Mila, the city.”  

I poked my head through, sticking out into a random Sonic parking lot, then turning back around to Elle.  

“What do we do?”  

“Uh...”  

She paced around for a moment, then stopped to say something, only coming out as a gasp, then a hum.  

“The tarp! You know, the one we used to cover up that hole with the Cheerio box with the eyes?”  

“Oh yeah, I forgot about that...” 

Elle ran off somewhere, leaving me alone with the Albuquerque hole. Then the screaming started. A few individual and distant screeches then erupted into a cacophony of noise as hundreds, maybe thousands of voices began emitting a high-pitched screech from inside the hole. About a dozen different human arms and legs of various lengths and body types reached out of the hole pulling up, something.  

A huge, lumbering mass of pasty white flesh and various human limbs flopped onto the bathroom tiles with a slimy thump. Wrapping its limbs around the sink and ripping it off, one of countless, buggy eyes stared at me. Studying me. It let out a dry whimper. Its chest, or chests, ripped open, a mouth forming from its flesh. It’s hundreds of ribs ripped through it’s ‘lips’ and crunched together. Forming teeth. The full bodies of people formed a tongue and rough, papery flesh formed inside.   

I sighed, walking over to the storage closet, I heard the thing trying to chase me from behind. There were a few things inside the closet, another mop, some bleach, a few bottles of washing-up liquid, and a crowbar. A weapon.  

The crowbar slammed against the thing, it let out a grumble, more bored than anything. Then slammed a bloated arm against my body, sending me tumbling through the air and smacking against the ceiling. Falling onto the carpet. It slumped forward towards me and started pulling itself up to me. I tried to get up, but my leg collapsed underneath me, the bone snapping with a sickened crunch and I fell onto the ground.   

Elle, who just so happened to walk in holding the tarp physically jumped back a few feet, if I wasn’t about to be eaten by a swollen mass of human limbs, I might’ve laughed.  

“Oh, crap!”  

She threw the tarp at it, which seemed to melt into the creature. Still barely visible underneath its skin. It looked at her like a toddler looks at an ant, tilting its heads at her in confusion. She threw a chunk of the wall at it, the brick seemed to do more damage than the crowbar, causing a barely visible bruise and making the creature emit a low grumble.  

“Shit, where’s Andy?”  

“He went to...ngh...shops...” I managed to get out, still reeling from the pain.

The door burst open; Andy walked in holding a new copy of Diary of a Wimpy Kid in his left hand and a six-pack of discounted beer in the other. He looked around for a moment, searching the room for me, then finally spotting the huge flesh creature.   

“What’s uhm... what’s that?”  

“I-I don’t know? It just showed up!”  

“From WHERE!?” he threw a few pint glasses at it, it slowly lumbered towards him, each laboured movement causing it to wheeze and sputter, occasionally shivering and freezing up.  

“Albuquerque!”  

“That’s in America, and how’d it even get in here? It’s huge!”  

“FLOOR!” she threw a piece of splintered wood from the wall at it, the creature let out a scream, or screams. Hundreds of voices all joined together in pain. It crashed its body against the wall and fell through, landing on a piece of broken concrete wall, the supports stabbing through its back. It spat out some blood, and its eyes rolled back. And it was over. Quickly, surprisingly quickly. It was dead.  

“What the...what the hell...” Andy panted, leaning against the counter, then looking at the wall the creature fell through, which was slowly regenerating. The brick and concrete grew back as the beast’s body dissolved into a small puddle of black goo. Elle lifted me, then walked over to Andy, grabbing his arm and dragging him to the bathroom to show him the Albuquerque portal.   

“It came out from there.”  

“The hole? How’d that thing even get out it’s like a metre wide tops...”  

I pushed my hands together slowly, making a bad deflating noise as I did.   

“Smaller, it got...it got smaller.”  

“Huh, neat.” He looked down into the hole “What do we do with it?”  

“Well, I used the tarp up, so I think we should just pretend the toilet’s clogged or something...”  

I think I blacked out around here from the blood loss. Convenient, right? Now I don’t have to write anything more. (My pen’s nearly out of ink anyway.) When I woke up, Elle was toasting bits of bacon over the fireplace, whilst Andy was telling her about some ghost he saw the other day.  

As for my leg, it still hurts. A lot, like A LOT a lot. We can’t get any cell service from in here, so no ambulance. At least for a while. Elle wrapped some wet paper towels around it, but it was still bleeding. Somehow. It’s nice being alone with her, well mostly alone, Andy is half asleep and groggily trying to make some coffee in the bar whilst flipping through the book he got. She also finally managed to get the TV working, thank God, and she put me on one of the sofa chairs. I might just sleep here. She’s asleep already. Fell asleep about an hour ago when she ran out of hypotheticals to ask me. She’s nice to be around like that. She talks and I listen.   

Talk to you tomorrow journal.  

12/12/08  

After my leg got completely and utterly obliterated, Andy begrudgingly agreed to take my shift if I gave him my copy of Hot Fuzz. But now it’s back to work for lil ol’ me, nothing’s happened, yet. There is that woman in the bloody wedding dress who’s floating an inch off the floor, but she comes in here every two days and orders the same gin every two days. She’s on one of the slot machines right now.  

“Hey, are you real?”  

“Huh?” Her eyes shifted over to me, then back to the slot machine. She slammed her fist against it in anger, presumably she just lost 2 quid.  

“Are you like, a living person?”  

She chuckled, spinning around.  

“Oh no, I don’t think so at least.”  

I raised an eyebrow  

“You don’t think so?”   

“Have you seen my husband?” 

“...no? I don’t think so at least.” she took a medieval mace out from, somewhere, and slammed it onto the bar counter, sending some wood splinters into my face, which bounced off my face and onto the floor. “Agh! God, why do you have a mace!?”  

“I am the widow of the well, master of souls, the terror of Roby, and the scourge of all things holy! Your soul is mine, Hoffman! Prepare for your DOOM!” she swung her cartoonishly large battle mace at me, which grazed my shirt slightly, but the force nearly knocked me off my feet anyway. Andy yelled something at me from across the room, probably with no relation to the mace-wielding ghost attacking me. I reached under the counter, grabbing a spray bottle with a cross lazily scratched on it. Then pointed it at her. “What, what on earth is that...” she looked at the bottle, raising an eyebrow, her accent faltering slightly. I tried squirting it. Empty. We really need to get more holy water.

“Why...why are you trying to kill me...!?” I said, half panting and still reeling from the shock of having a battle mace nearly lodged into my cranium. She sighed.   

“Too many questions, not enough soul consuming.” She tried to wack me with the mace again.  

“Christ, stop! My legs are already broken, I don’t need my head smashed!” I threw a bottle of brandy at them. She made a light oof and fell to the ground unconscious. I looked over the counter, why is everything that comes in here so conveniently weak? That giant limb monster only took a piece of rebar to kill it, and now the ghost? It weirded me out. That’s when Elle finally arrived.  

“Hey, Mila! How’s your...oh my-” she looked down, then kicked the unconscious lady’s head lightly with her foot “Is she...Is she dead?” she looked down, noticing the large wound in her chest.  

“Kinda? I think she’s a ghost.” I hobbled over. She sighed.  

“I’ll go get the shovel, we’re running out of places to bury these things, Mila.”  

“I know, but what else are we supposed to do?”  

“We could let her wake up?” She knelt, picked up the battle mace, and handed it to me to put behind the counter  

“Then what? We don’t even know her motives. She could start attacking us again.” I protested, Elle sighed, attempting to pick up the ghost, but her arms went straight through her  

“What the...How’d it even get hurt by the brandy bottle if it’s a ghost?” I still don’t have an answer to that one. Andy, who was chain-smoking cigarettes and lying on a table chimed in.  

“Why don’t we shut up, forget about her and watch something. Elle fixed the TV, and we haven’t even used it since Monday!” He sat up, then hopped off the table, walking to the TV and flicking a few switches, I wasn't sure he knew what any of them did.

Elle spent the next 10 minutes trying to get rid of the ghost, she eventually woke up of course, but she just seemed sad and asked for a beer. I think she’s on the slot machine again. Andy eventually figured out the TV controls and managed to put on some local TV channel. It's mostly news, apparently there was an explosion last night. Out deep in the woods. It's probably nothing to worry about. 

Elle says she wants to put up a Christmas tree tomorrow. So, I’ve got that to look forward to. She was driving me home at the time. The orange street lights were slowly fading into the cavernous darkness of the woods, I could've worn I saw shining yellow eyes in the forest. Everyone does. There's something out there, that's for sure. 

“Watcha writing?” she glanced at me for a moment, then back at the road.

“Oh, it’s just...it’s nothing.”  

“Well, it’s not nothing. I have eyes, you know?” She fiddled with the radio, occasionally looking at my journal. I really don’t like when people look through my stuff. I’m always scared I wrote something stupid in the moment and forgot to get rid of it.  

“It’s just my journal  

“Oh! That’s nice, what do you write in it?”  

“Stuff.”  

“Stuff?”  

“Yeah, just...stuff.”  

“Have you written about me?” she put on a high school musical mean girl voice.  

“Oh, no! No, no uh, why would I ever do that?” I said, lying through my teeth.   

The car screeched to a stop. There was moose in the road, in the middle of the Lincolnshire countryside, there was a 7-foot-tall moose just...there. Then, it stood up. It stared at us for a good 30 seconds, it strolled up to our car like a person, bending down next to my window to look in, it knocked on my window with its hoof. I lowered the window. Then it meowed, not like a cat, more like someone pretending to be a cat. It stared at me with its cold, black eyes. I stared back for a moment, then it started meowing again. I rolled up the car window. Elle obviously got the message and started driving.  

After about another twenty minutes of driving in silence (mostly silence anyway, Elle had put on Linkin Park a while ago), we finally arrived at my flat. It was dark outside; the streets were a yellowish orange from the streetlights.  

“I’ll see you tomorrow Elle...” I turned around to her, smiling weakly. She smiled back, then waved. Getting back into her car and driving off.   

I’m probably going to go to bed, it’s getting late. My clock’s broken though, so I’m just guessing.  

Goodnight.  

13/12/08 

After around two hours of sleep? (I think? Like I said, my clock’s broken.) I went through my normal morning routine: wake up, shower, clean up my face a bit, tea, and the bus. A pretty average day so far. Andy had found an old, dusty digital camera earlier that day. I don’t know how he gets here so early. 

“Come on, we have to film SOMETHING with it!” He said, spinning the camera around in his hand. 

“I am not going into the woods. We don’t know what could be out there.” Elle looked down at him, clearly unimpressed. 

“But we could film it, put it on YouTube!” he protested, pointing the camera at Elle’s face and zooming it in. 

“You sound like every found footage protagonist to ever exist. I don’t want to get Blair Witched for YouTube.” 

“You’re no fun Elle, Mila you agree, right?” 

I looked over at them, I had been too busy trying to fix a picture frame that had fallen off the wall with super glue to be all that invested in the conversation. 

“I don’t mind; I could use a break from the madness.” I put the super glue down, walked over to the coat hanger, and grabbed my stuff. Andy was ecstatic to get off work for a while. Elle on the other hand, looked mortified. 

Andy opened the door and walked out into the street, inhaling a deep breath and then violently coughing from the fumes. It smelt like rot, shit, and petrol. Like any other well-respecting English town, the smell of natural fertilizer (cow crap) wafted through the air and hung like a stinking fog.  

After making sure Andy wasn’t actually dying, we decided to head into a corner shop to grab some supplies. 

“Should we get one or two packs of digestives?” Elle looked down at the packets, then handed them to me, I put them in the basket. 

“Isn’t two a bit excessive? We only have £5.” I grabbed one of the packets, throwing it in between my hands as Elle began to talk. 

“Well, we might as well. Andy ate like three packets in an hour after the Albuquerque incident...”  

After wandering around the corner shop for another few minutes, we decided to get going. It was about midday by now, the thin veil of snow shone in the bright sun, and the forest was completely leafless, well maybe a few evergreens here and there, but mostly greyish brown nets of branch. 

Andy was a few metres in front of me and Elle, he was recording various things with the camera, pointing it out into the darkness of the forest occasionally. He stumbled over something, then looked behind him. There was a huge femur half submerged into the ground, various mushrooms and plants grew out from the side and tangled over the seemingly ancient bone. What was weirder is that it was just a femur, nothing else. I would've expected a full skeleton. It’s probably not important though, I’m sure whatever elder God that bone belonged to shouldn’t be much of a problem anymore.

The orange evening sun crept through the trees, and we were quite frankly, very lost. I could swear I could see figures shifting in and out of the tree line, running, staring. A man walked out of the treeline, his movements were fast and unnatural, sporadic, his limbs and extremities were bent out of shape and disfigured. Boils and rashes covered his body, leaking a yellowish puss that stuck to his skin.  

He turned around, the wrinkled skin on his face looked like it was melting. Drooping off in long flaps of flesh. He shouted something in... Spanish? Maybe? I don’t know, I couldn’t make out the language, then began chasing after us. Andy ran off into the woods, Elle darted into a ditch, the creature seemed more occupied with Andy, so I dropped into the ditch with Elle. I heard some shouting in the distance, some screaming, things snapping, crunching.  

As far as I was concerned, me and Elle were as good as dead. I knew that at any moment, that thing could appear, and kill us both.  

“Hey, Elle?” I looked over at her, my head hurt from the constant fear, and my leg throbbed with a sharp, stabbing pain. 

“Yeah?” 

“What’s it like?” 

“What’s what like?” 

“Being normal.” 

“You’re pretty normal, in my opinion. No offense.” 

“I’m not.” 

“What, why?”  

I feel like she was just trying to be nice, I’m not normal in many aspects. I didn’t answer.  

She looked out of the ditch. 

“Is it still out there?”  

The rustling and movement we had heard throughout the night had been gone for about an hour.  

“We could probably make a run for it...” I added. 

“Too risky. We could try sneaking?” 

“This thing probably knows the forest better than anything else. It’s at an advantage in every way...” 

I nodded. 

“Well, we can’t just stay out here forever, right?” 

She thought for a moment, then grabbed my hand. 

“Just, stay with me.” 

I nodded. 

What followed was about an hour of stumbling through the forest, trying not to scream whenever something made a noise behind us, and attempting to look for Andy. We found him hidden behind a tree, his shirt was ripped up and muddy. I'm just happy nobody died.

We made it out of those woods, thankfully, I’m writing from my room. I have no idea what the time is. I should get some sleep. 

Mila, going to bed.  

14/12/08  

I woke up to someone banging on my door in the middle of the night. There were some muffled shouts, some loud bangs, and then silence. By the time I had come down to see what had happened, there was nothing. Only a few shotgun shells on the floor, and a few puddles of crimson blood. I didn’t call the police. They wouldn’t help. But I knew who could.  

“Hey, has Bear been here recently?” I looked over at Andy, who was washing some glasses  

“Huh, oh yeah. He’s over there.” He pointed at a half-awake Bear; he had a half drank a pint of Guinness next to him  

“Is he even awake...?”  

“I doubt it, he’s had three pints already.” Suddenly, Bear looked up, his beard was slightly stained a yellowish-brown  

“Hey, bear, uhm, do you know what this is...?” I handed him the shotgun shell, the golden rim shone under the humming fluorescent light.  

“It’s a 70mm. The Remington 870 uses those.” He got up, examining the shell like an archaeologist with some ancient artifact “Where did you find it?”  

“It was on the floor, outside my flat.” I looked at the shell, it was slightly muddy and stained from the blood. He handed it back to me and then smiled.  

“Stay safe, you never know who could be watching.” and with that, he walked off.  

“Wow, ominous,” Andy said, putting a pint glass in the cabinet  

“What do you think that’s about?”  

“My best guess is the dark lord Xylanoth that we found out was watching us last week, but that’s just me.” I had forgotten about that.  

“Well yeah, but there’s like 18 different things watching us.”

There was a crash from the other side of the room, Elle had dropped a Christmas decoration on the floor, she said about 30 different curse words I had never heard before in my life, walking over to the storage closet to grab the sweeper.   

“You good?” I asked, stupidly. Andy kicked my foot; something had obviously happened that I wasn’t aware of.  

“No, Mila, I am not 'good'!” She shouted from across the room, grabbing the sweeper and sweeping the broken glass into a corner, then throwing it onto the ground.  

“I’ll make you some tea...” I turned around, grabbing the tea bag tin from the cabinet, I heard Elle walking over to me from the Christmas tree, and grab my hand. I got caught off guard by her touch.  

“Can I talk to you for a moment?”  

“Huh, oh, uh...sure.” She dragged me to the storage closet, she’s stronger than she looks.   

“My mum was found missing last night.”  

“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t kno-” She interrupted before I could finish.  

“No, Mila, it’s not that it’s...”  

“It’s what...?”  

“My mother is dead. She died three years ago.” That was when the breathing started. It was a quiet, muffled noise. It was coming from behind us. We turned around. There was an old woman. She was fused with the wall, her breathing was slowed, her eyes were closed, she looked...I don’t know, defeated? Her body was pale and covered in reddish growths and boils, her bones malformed to the point that they were completely unrecognisable.

“Is that...?” I turned to Elle, who was clearly not taking seeing her mother fused with a brick wall. Then again, I could never know what it was like. Seeing someone you love displayed in death in such a macabre way. Was she even dead? I don’t know if that would make it better or worse. Elle was visibly shaking and slowly backing away from the wall to the closet door. I walked backward towards the door and tried to open it. Locked. “Crap, it’s locked! What do we do?” Elle sputtered something I couldn’t make out, and I looked around for something, anything that could get us out. There was a knock at the door.  

“Can you guys hurry up with...whatever you’re doing? I need to get the detergent.” It was Andy.  

“Andy open the door!” I shouted, the wall mother was, I don’t know, growing? Or at the very least it was trying to get to us.  

“Are you alright? I heard some banging, and I came to check on you.”  

“We’re fine, just open the door!!” I slammed my fist against the closet door.  

“Okay, okay, jeez...” He tried at the door handle, it swung open, and I fell back, my leg (Which was still broken!) radiated shockwaves of pain, I think I broke it again.  

“Ah, God!” I grabbed my leg, still lying on my back, I looked over at Elle, who was still frozen in fear and grabbed her leg. “Elle! Elle!” I shook her leg.  

“Huh...” She backed up, nearly standing on my hair. Andy looked into the room, the person in the wall was dissolving. Her flesh was melting, thick slobs of red bile flopped onto the floor and hissed as the acids burnt into the floor. The woman's meat was covered in boils and foamed up, her eyes were bulging out of her face, dipping down her face and sliding down her chest. She didn't scream, didn't even seem worried. She just looked, at peace. Like she had accepted her fate.

“Is it...It’s digesting her.” Andy spoke softly; his voice was shaky. Disturbed.  

“What is?” I looked over at him, Elle was trying to help me up whilst I did.  

“The building, it’s eating her.” I thought for a moment; it didn’t seem too outlandish. In fact, I was kind of expecting the building to do this. That must be why the bodies keep disappearing, the pub was eating them.  

“So that must mean...”  

“The building’s alive.” He looked around, the walls seemed to pulsate, the cameras were locked on him like eyes.  

“Then why did it have my mum!?” Elle shouted, looking over at the spot where the old woman was. “I-It doesn’t make sense! Why did it have her!? How did it get her!?” She slammed her fist against the wall, her eyes were watery and red, her knuckles were now bruised from punching a solid brick wall.   

The building was alive, that’s why it wasn’t built! It grew! How alive was the building though? Is it fully conscious? It protects itself so it must have some form of intelligence. And Elle’s mother, how’d the pub get her? Honestly, we’d been left with more questions than answers from the whole ordeal. All I know now is that we’re never alone now. We’re constantly being watched; there’s no escape from it.   

I think I’ll look through the DVDs tomorrow, I need to take my mind off things.  

Mila going to sleep, hoping the beg bugs don’t bite.  

UPDATE: Something just meowed outside of my window. I don’t own a cat.  

15/12/08  

Elle seems happier today, she says she hasn’t told the police about her mother. They wouldn’t believe her anyway. She had a private funeral last night, to help her cope. I guess her mother will be missing forever.   

Anyway, some guys in suits came in today. Said they wanted a sample of the building. I thought it was weird but agreed. I haven’t seen them in a while, I did hear some screaming though, something about a sonic. I’m sure their fine. Probably.  

Andy managed to get the tree up whilst Elle worked at the bar. Whilst they were, I was looking through the DVD box.   

“Hey, how many do we have left?”  

“Huh? Oh like, fourteen. I think.” Andy answered.  

“Ah.” I sorted through them, there were the ones we had already watched, the wonderful ice cream suit, some cartoons, protect and survive (an old nuclear war PSA), and ghostbusters one & two. “What’s next?”  

“The Santa Clause I think...”  

“Why? That movie sucks.” Elle added from across the room, pouring some whisky for someone. Andy looked offended.   

“That’s Christmas heresy, Elle.”  

“So? Sue me, coward.”  

Andy grumbled something, then walked off to grab more Christmas stuff. We have A LOT of Christmas stuff.   

The silence was loud, me and Elle don’t talk much. Well, we do, but we’re really nervous around each other so it barely works. We’re either too awkward to talk to each other, or we talk for too long, and we forget we’re here to do a job. She’s the type of person who can talk for hours on end and still have something else to tell you about at the end of the day. She’s definitely my favourite person. Honestly, I’m in a complete mental hell about her. Sometimes I can’t get to sleep because I call her every night. I should really cut down on that. My phone bill’s getting out of hand.  

“Are you doing anything after work?” she asked.  

“Huh? Oh, no I don’t think so, I’m probably just gonna go to sleep. Probably. Yeah.”  

“Oh, well, I was gonna go to the park, but I don’t really want to go alone, you never know what could be out there. Especially around here.” I nodded, then stopped for a moment.   

“I wouldn’t mind going with you, but only if you want me to! I mean, you probably don’t want me to bu-”   

“Mila, shut up.” she interrupted, catching me off guard, then walked over to me and grabbed my shoulder. “Meet me at six. The park. Don’t be late. ’kay?”   

“Huh, oh, uh okay then...” 

The door swung open, it slammed against the wall, Elle let a scream, more of a screech, and fell backwards. In the doorway was a small, fat, 4 foot nothing blonde child with a ridiculously large rainbow lollipop, he had large goopy blue eyes, a blue and white striped shirt, brown overalls, cowboy boots, and a hat with a printed picture of a sheriff badge stapled to it on. He looked around for a moment, stared at me for about a minute, then spoke. He had a thick Texan accent and a much deeper voice than what belonged to him. 

“Howdy miss, get me some prairie dew and I’ll be outta here. Today’s been a doozy...” 

I walked over to the bar, the kid waddled over to the stool, his spurs clicking against the carpet, then pulled himself up. 

“Can I see some ID?” 

“Well, excuse me miss but I don’t got an ID. Too easy to track me, yew see?” 

I figured this was probably a ghost or something. 

“What’s prairie dew?” 

He sighed, dropping the Texas accent. 

“It’s whisky.” 

“Oh, figures. Are you over 18?” 

“Yeah? I’m forty-seven.” He put the Texan accent back on. I decided it was best not to question it and poured the drink for him. He drank it in a few seconds, jumped off the stool, then ran out onto the road and immediately got hit by a truck and was flung into the air, smacking his head against a lamppost and spraying his brains everywhere. His body fell to the ground with a sickly wet splat.

I’m pretty sure I just committed some form of manslaughter. 

So, as of now, I’ve got a few things to worry about. It’s ten minutes till 6. But there’s something outside my door. I don’t think it’s human. It’s meowing, shit is it that moose again? It keeps showing up, hang on.   

So, it WAS the moose. Well, the moose was here, anyway. It left before I went outside, convenient. Anyway, after the whole park thing (Which was very mushy and gross and would ruin the whole vibe I’m going for) the moose returned, except, it was different. Its skull was elongated and bent, it was completely hairless apart from some long, wiry hairs that dotted its head and back. Its antlers were grown out into hundreds of twisted, bony branches. Its teeth jutted out of its mouth and curled back into its lower jaw, and it was staring at me. It looked at me for a good eight to ten minutes, before it turned around, got on its hind legs, and strolled away into the woods. It doesn’t seem all that malicious, just a bit curious at most.  

So, quite a good day in my book. 

Mila, signing off.  

16/12/08

Woah, eight days till Christmas! Crazy, right? I’m weirdly optimistic today, for once it doesn’t feel like the world is about to end. Well, maybe it is, but I'm just going to ignore that for now. Ignorance is bliss, right?  

“Hey, Mila, do you remember the Albuquerque hole?” Andy asked, lying on the table he normally lies on.  

“Huh, yeah? Of course I do that’s how I broke my leg...” I looked down at my still broken leg, it was getting better, it still had a cast on it, it had been signed by a few people, and I think one of the gnomes has taken a bite out of it.  

“And you remember the suit guys?”  

“We get a lot of suit guys.”  

“The ones that went missing.”  

“We get a lot of suit guys that go missing.”  

“The ones from yesterday.”  

“OH, yeah, yeah what about them?”  

“I think they fell in the Albuquerque hole.”  

I sighed and got up, walking over to the bathroom, there was the hole. Still there, still a metre wide, and still a problem. I knelt, looked down into it, and was launched back by the body of one of the suit guys. If you haven’t come into contact with a dead body before (I hope most of you haven’t...), imagine a sandbag, now fill that sandbag with viscous fluids, smaller, squishier sandbags, and an unimaginable, strangely sweet stench that only the devil himself could concoct, and you might get an inch closer to what came out of that hole.  

I stumbled back, looking down at the body, some of his organs had tumbled out onto the tiled floor, and the stench was so overwhelming I was close to gagging.  

“Ah, Jesus! What, what the hell!?” I yelled, trying to kick away from the body.  

Andy had walked back into the hallway, I looked down, my clothes were surprisingly dry, and I looked back at the body. It was clear he had been rotting for a while, his flesh dangled in ropes off his bones, his skin was a greenish transparent white, and his fingers and stomach were bloated and had a deep brown hue.   

I looked at the dog tag lazily strewn on the body’s neck, it read: ‘Steele Edward – 00-BD31267-Catholic'. Well, we knew his name, so we could probably contact his family. It’ll be a mess to cover up though, we’ve had too many police here after the Bonfire Night incident.  

Andy looked absolutely traumatised. His eyes were fixed on the body, occasionally flickering over to me. Then, something else fell out. I was slammed against the wall; I didn’t even get a glance at whatever it was. It seemed lanky, very tall, at least 7 feet tall. Its touch was cold. I heard some yelling as I was dropped onto the ground, some crunching, fleshy sounds, like someone biting into a piece of lettuce. Then I went unconscious.  

I don’t really know where I am right now, it’s cold, the walls are a light grey concrete. There’s a big metal door as well, I heard some people outside. My head hurts.

# Electric kettle vs. Kettle & Warmer 2025: Efficiency Showdown - Which saves You Money?

In the realm of commercial kitchens, offices, and shared spaces, the seemingly simple task of heating water can have a surprising impact on your bottom line. Whether it's for brewing that perfect cup of coffee, preparing tea for a team, or creating instant soups and noodles, the method you choose to heat water matters. Two popular contenders for this task are the electric kettle and the kettle and warmer combination. But which option truly comes out on top when it comes to efficiency and long-term cost savings? Let's dive deep into the electric kettle vs kettle and warmer efficiency differences to uncover the truth.

[[Explore Top Rated electric kettle vs kettle and warmer efficiency differences on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/travel-gifts-7/?kw=%%keyword%)
## Understanding the Contenders: Electric kettles and Kettle Warmers

Before we can compare, it's essential to understand what these appliances are and how they work.

**Electric Kettles:** These self-contained units rapidly heat water using an internal heating element. They're known for their speed and convenience,automatically shutting off once the water boils. The ""best commercial electric kettle,"" as many users search, is one that balances capacity, durability, and energy efficiency. Different wattage electric kettles will affect boiling time, with models offering faster boiling at the expense of higher energy demands and vice versa.

**Kettle and Warmer Combinations:** This approach involves boiling water separately,which is then poured into a kettle that sits on a warming plate. The warming plate maintains the water temperature,keeping it hot and ready for dispensing. While they offer convenience, the persistent warmer functionality has notable energy implications.

[[Explore Top Rated electric kettle vs kettle and warmer efficiency differences on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/travel-gifts-7/?kw=%%keyword%)
## The Efficiency Showdown: Breaking Down the Numbers

The crux of the matter lies in the energy consumption of each method. Let's look at the factors affecting the ""electric kettle energy consumption"" and ""kettle warmer power consumption.""

### Electric Kettle Efficiency: Targeted Heating

Electric kettles excel in efficiency as they heat water directly. All power is used to bring water to boil. How efficient is it? When looking at electric kettle vs stovetop kettle efficiency, most studies clearly show the electric kettle wins.This is because you are directly heating the water versus applying heat to a pot, which then heats the water within.

Factors influencing electric kettle energy consumption include:

*   **Wattage:** Higher wattage kettles boil water faster but draw more power.*   **Volume of Water:** Heating a full kettle consumes more energy than heating only the needed amount.
*   **initial Water Temperature:** starting with cooler water naturally requires more energy to reach boiling point.

### Kettle Warmer Inefficiency: constant Energy Output

The main drawback of kettle warmers is their continual energy usage. The ""kettle warmer power consumption"" never stops as long as the warmer is engaged. While it may seem convenient, think about this:

*   **Maintaining Temperature:** A kettle warmer continuously consumes power to maintain the water's temperature, even if no one is using the kettle. This ""trickle"" feed of energy adds up significantly over hours or days.
*   **Heat Loss:** Kettles on warmers are prone to heat loss, meaning the warming plate needs to work even harder to compensate, further increasing energy consumption.
*   **Evaporation:** The continuous heating from a warming plate can lead to water evaporation, requiring refills and additional boiling cycles.

### Quantifying the Cost: ""Cost to Boil Water with Electric Kettle""

To truly grasp the difference, let's consider the actual cost. You can calculate the cost to boil water with electric kettle. Assume a standard electric kettle uses 1500W (1.5kW).Boiling one liter of water might take approximately 3 minutes (0.05 hours). This means one boiling cycle consumes approximately 0.075 kWh of energy (1.5 kW * 0.05 hours). The cost per boil depends on your electricity rate. If electricity costs $0.20 per kWh, each boil costs $0.015.

While this seems minimal, consider a commercial setting needing numerous boils daily. The collective cost is easily managed and predictable with an electric kettle.

In contrast, a kettle warmer might only use 50W but runs constantly for hours. Over an 8-hour workday, this equates to 0.4 kWh of energy consumption per day. at the same $0.20 per kWh rate,it costs $0.08 per day. Although this is a higher initial cost, it fails in comparison to a high volume of kettle boils.### Beyond Boiling: Considering the Larger Impact – Energy Efficient Hot Water Solutions

When comparing energy efficient hot water solutions, and not boiling specifically, kettle warmers falter even further. The only exception where a kettle warmer maybe slightly better is if you only need a very minor amount of hot water throughout the day.

## targeting Specific User Needs: Catering to Our Audience

Now, let's tailor this comparison to the specific needs of our target audience:

**Office Managers:** For office managers, the priority is ""cost-effective solutions for providing hot water to employees."" They need to consider energy bills, maintenance, and the convenience of having hot water readily available. The long term cost of electric kettle is much easier to control versus a warmer plate. Given the frequency of use in an office setting, the electric kettle is the most fiscally responsible choice. Electric kettles easily manage the needs for light volume and high boil frequency.

**Cafe/Restaurant Owners:** For cafe and restaurant owners, the criteria are slightly different.They require ""reliable and efficient water heating for brewing coffee/tea,"" with a focus on speed, capacity, and operational costs. While speed becomes a factor,the commercial coffee maker energy consumption also needs consideration.While a warmer is out of the question for this set, exploring a water boiler vs kettle energy consumption becomes important. Water boilers are typically used for high-volume needs.

**Building Managers:** Building managers prioritize ""enduring and energy-efficient equipment for shared spaces."" They must adhere to environmental regulations while minimizing operational expenses. Here, the electric kettle's on-demand heating and ability to shut off automatically once boiling makes it very suitable for eco-friendly practices.

**Purchasing Agents:** Purchasing agents focus on ""making informed decisions about purchasing in bulk."" They prioritize specifications, maintenance costs, and quality of goods. The simplicity of the electric kettle translates to both lower purchase costs and lower maintenance, making it the best solution.

## Choosing the Right Kettle: Factors to Consider

If an electric kettle is the right choice for you, here are factors to consider when searching for the ""best commercial electric kettle"":

*   **Capacity:** Select a capacity that aligns with your typical usage. Overly large kettles waste energy by heating unneeded water.*   **Wattage:** Balance speed with energy consumption. Higher wattage means faster boiling, but also higher energy usage. Consider looking into an electric kettle wattage vs boiling time.
*   **Material:** Stainless steel is durable and hygienic, making it ideal for commercial settings.
*   **Features:** Look for automatic shut-off, boil-dry protection, and cool-touch exteriors for safety and convenience.
*   **Brand Reputation:** Research reputable brands known for their quality and reliability.

1ju1k1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDealsAmazon/comments/1ju1k1p/where_to_find_the_best_amazon_deals_in_2025_my/,Where to Find the Best Amazon Deals in 2025: My Personal Journey,"As someone who spends countless hours hunting for Amazon bargains to share on my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/share/12HG63PgAbv/?mibextid=wwXIfr), I've developed a knack for uncovering hidden discounts that most shoppers miss. Let me walk you through my proven strategies for finding the best Amazon deals that I post daily.

The Secret Amazon Coupon Page

One of my favorite discoveries was Amazon's hidden coupon section. Unlike traditional deals, these digital coupons can be ""clipped"" and applied at checkout for additional savings. To find them on desktop, navigate to ""Today's Deals"" at the top of the page, then scroll through the categories until you reach ""Coupons"" at the very end. On the Amazon app, tap the three bars at the bottom of the homepage, select ""Deals & Savings,"" then ""Today's Deals,"" and finally scroll to ""Coupons""

The best part? You can stack these coupons on top of existing discounts during major sales events like Prime Day and Black Friday, maximizing your savings.

Mastering the Discount Search Hack

My followers are always amazed when I share deals with 50-90% discounts. Here's my secret: Amazon has a hidden URL parameter that lets you filter by discount percentage. After performing a regular search, simply add ""&pct-off=50-"" to the end of the search URL to see items that are 50% off or more.

For example, if you're looking for coffee makers with 75% discounts, search for ""coffee makers"" and then add ""&pct-off=75-"" to the URL. You can also specify ranges like ""&pct-off=50-90"" to see items discounted between 50% and 90%.

Daily and Lightning Deals

I check Amazon's ""Today's Deals"" section multiple times daily because Lightning Deals can appear and disappear within hours. These time-sensitive offers often feature substantial discounts on a wide range of products[1].

A pro tip I've learned: sort the Today's Deals section by ""Discount — High to Low"" to immediately see the biggest markdowns. I've found items discounted up to 97% using this method!

Amazon Warehouse and Open Box Deals

For those who don't mind slightly imperfect packaging, Amazon Warehouse offers incredible savings. These open-box or preowned items typically come with discounts up to 25%

I've personally purchased electronics and kitchen appliances this way and saved hundreds of dollars. During major shopping events like Prime Day, Amazon often offers an additional 20% off Warehouse items, making the deals even sweeter

Price Tracking Tools

I never purchase anything on Amazon without checking its price history first. Using tools like CamelCamelCamel, I can see if an item is truly at a low price or if Amazon has artificially inflated the ""original"" price.

The ""Top Price Drops"" feature on CamelCamelCamel is particularly useful. I select my desired category and minimum discount percentage (from 5% up to 90%), and instantly see which items have recently dropped in price.

Subscribe & Save Discounts

For household essentials and pantry items, I always recommend Subscribe & Save. Not only does this service provide regular deliveries, but you can save up to 15% when you subscribe to five or more items in a single month.

I've found some of my best deals by sorting through Subscribe & Save offers for items like coffee, snacks, and cleaning supplies.

Movers and Shakers

The ""Movers and Shakers"" section shows products with rapidly increasing popularity in the last 24 hours. This is where I often find trending items before they sell out, especially books available for preorder with discounts up to 30%.

My Daily Deal-Hunting Routine

Every morning, I start by checking Lightning Deals, then move to the coupon page, and finally browse Warehouse offers. I post the best finds directly to my Facebook page, where thousands of followers now rely on my daily deal alerts.

The thrill of finding a 75% discount on a popular kitchen gadget or a limited-time offer on premium headphones never gets old. What started as a hobby has become a passion for helping others save money on their Amazon purchases.

If you're looking for daily Amazon deals without the hassle of searching yourself, follow my Facebook page where I post the best discounts I find every single day. Happy shopping and even happier saving!",1,1744074570.0,DailyDealsAmazon,0,1.0,False

1ju1ey3,https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/1ju1ey3/lack_of_deep_sleep_caused_by_allergy_medications/,Lack of Deep Sleep Caused by Allergy Medication(s),"Hi everyone! This is my first post here, but I wanted to share my story. I apologize in advance as I know this is going to be a read. 

TLDR: Diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia after sleep studies finding no real cause of constant exhaustion/no deep sleep no matter the amount of sleep. Found out myself that no deep sleep was caused by daily allergy medication(s) and sleep specialist was not aware of this side effect and dismissed it.

I've had sleep issues for the majority of my life, but things only started to get worse for me in November of 2023. It got to the point of me being so tired all of the time that I would fall asleep if I wasn't actively moving around. I would fall asleep if I was sitting for just a few moments if no one was talking with me or if I wasn't doing something somewhat active enough to keep me awake. I remember one time I fell asleep while I was drinking coffee on a day off at one point. All I would do outside of work was sleep and felt exhausted no matter how much sleep I got. 

I have a smart watch that detects my sleep patterns and it showed how I was regularly getting very very little to no deep sleep at all each night, even though I would be sleeping for extended amounts of time each day. I knew at the rate I was going, I had to do what was best to get myself back on track and figure out what was needed to do to get better. I went to see my doctor and explained my issues and they even mentioned that they could tell how exhausted and out of it I was. I was referred to a sleep specialist and had a home sleep study device sent to me. 

The home sleep study device reminded me of a pulse oximeter. It was to be placed on your finger and worn for three consecutive nights while recording the information through an app on my phone. Interestingly enough, after completing the home sleep study and getting the results back about 1-2 weeks later, the results of the home sleep study showed almost the exact same results that my watch had been receiving for the past couple of months. It showed that I was getting very little to no deep sleep at all. After reviewing this information with my sleep specialist, they requested I take an actual sleep study in the lab to further explore why I was not getting any deep sleep. 

Now here I will say that throughout this entire process I was continuously filling out paperwork listing all medications and vitamins/supplements that I took every day (as this is supposed to help find the reason as to why I was having sleep issues). After waiting about a month and a half, the day finally came for my scheduled sleep study. It was a two day sleep study. Each morning after I woke up, they had me fill out paperwork yet again listing all current medications and vitamins/supplements that I take every day as well as fill out a questionnaire about how alert or tired I felt. 

After the study, I was sent home and told to wait 1-2 weeks for the results to come back. Once my results came in, they explained that I did have Periodic Limb Movement disorder but that, yet again, I did not get any deep sleep throughout the sleep study and that they did not see a cause for why I wasn't going into this important part of the sleep cycle. Because of this, they diagnosed me with Idiopathic Hypersomnia as a lovely little umbrella term that they like to use when they have no idea what the actual cause is. 

After discussion with my sleep specialist, it was suggested to help alleviate my exhaustion to start taking a daily stimulant in the morning to help wake me up in the mornings. Since then I have being taking Armodafinil every morning and I will say I have noticed that it has definitely made a difference in helping me feel more alert and have more energy throughout the day. 

A couple of weeks go by, and I happen to be on a phone call with one of my close friends at the time who informs me that she had started to experience a lot of the same symptoms that I had been experiencing for the last 6 months after her doctor had her start taking Zyrtec for her allergies every day. Then it clicked. I had been taking Zyrtec daily for years at that point. I decided to do some digging on google and found that though it is a rare side effect, certain allergy medications can affect people's sleep quality. Because I was already at my lowest point, I figured for science I would test out this theory that my allergy medication may possibly be affecting my sleep quality and if it wasn't I could at least rule it out for being a contributing factor. About a week after I had stopped taking Zyrtec daily for my allergies, my watch started to show that I was getting deep sleep again. I could feel the difference as I actually started to feel somewhat rested after sleeping for the first time in a long time.

 I called my friend after this and told her that I had started getting better sleep and feeling more rested again and that my watch had showed that I was getting deep sleep again. I had suggested to her that with her experiencing the same things I had to maybe try the same thing herself and see if her sleep would also improve, and yet again if not at least rule out that it was causing her sleep issues. Lo and behold, after about a week of stopping the allergy medication she started to get better and more rested sleep again. 

My next follow up appointment with my sleep specialist, I mentioned this allergy medication reveal to my doctor and was amazed that my doctor not only never knew of this side effect but also never mentioned anything of it again, which honestly slightly bothered me as I felt like my findings were dismissed. After a couple of months and starting to feel miserable with my allergies as a result of incoming allergy season, I decided to try another daily allergy medicine (Claritin) in hopes that it would help my allergies but not effect my sleep as it was a different though similar enough allergy medication. Of course with my luck, about a week or so after I had started taking it, my sleep tanked and I wasn't getting any deep sleep again. I didn't start getting deep sleep until a little over a week after I had stopped taking Claritin. Now I just figure that I'll just suffer with my allergies as long as I'm getting decent sleep.

It was a 7 day trip to celebrate my daughter's (11)birthday. My son (7) has severe food allergies including egg, tree nuts and sesame oil. We are extremely careful with what he eats for obvious reasons, and always carry an Epi-pen.

My family and my wife's sister's family met up at Be Our Guest on our last night so our kids could take it all in one last night before heading home. Kids all at one table and adults right next to them. 

We let the servers know about my son's food allergies, and made it clear that if they can't assure us that they can make things safe for him to eat we brought a backup sandwich and chips. The server said the sheet friendly chicken tenders were safe for him so we ordered since he's been eating those all week at the various quick service spots around. 

He ate them along with the French fries that came with them and all was well. 

The dessert was next so again we asked the server if they can do a modified plate so my son could enjoy painting the teacup with his sister and cousins. They said yes no problem ""We do that all the time.""

All was going great! Dessert came and the server stopped by and said, ""The chef removed the macaron from his plate since that's made with egg whites, and instead of an extra cake pop on the plate since ""those are made without eggs."" That came directly from the chef.

We ordered coffee and started to enjoy our dessert and my kids started painting their teacups and having fun. Suddenly my daughter jumps up frantically and runs to me and says the cake pops have egg in them. Another server comes walking over very quickly as to not make a scene and confirms with me there is indeed egg in the cake they served to my son. Luckily he was so busy painting he hadn't taken a bite yet. 

I was in shock and my daughter started crying knowing what could have happened. My wife and I were so thankful that nothing bad happened that we were too in shock to raise any issue with the manager that soon came over to speak with us. The manager comped my daughter and son's meals without us asking. We paid and left. 

I'm still in shock. We got home last night and I laid in bed and started to cry thinking about what might have happened. God bless that second server who double checked the ingredients. We left her a massive tip in place of the charge for my kids' meals.

Please double and triple check with your servers if you or your loved ones have any severe food allergies. Always carry an Epi-pen like we do and never assume. Thankful my son is ok, but it obviously left a very sour taste in my mouth.",0,1744073897.0,WaltDisneyWorld,25,0.42,False
