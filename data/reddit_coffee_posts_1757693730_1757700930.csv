1nfafsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1nfafsc/evaluate_cottonelle_ultra_clean_toilet_paper/,Evaluate Cottonelle Ultra Clean Toilet Paper Strength and Comfort,"Trying out the Cottonelle Ultra Clean toilet paper with its unique Active CleaningRipples texture felt like I was becoming a connoisseur of bathroom luxuries. Testing a product like this might seem trivial to some, but for those of us who take ""bathroom time"" as seriously as morning coffee, it‚Äôs an essential consideration. This toilet paper is one I used for every trip to the restroom over several weeks, and let me say, the experience was‚Ä¶memorable.

**Design and Texture**  
The textured CleaningRipples design caught my eye as soon as I unwrapped the first roll. You‚Äôd think it‚Äôs a gimmick, but it genuinely makes the process more effective. The ridges aren‚Äôt just for show; they seem to remove more with less effort. Cottonelle touts this toilet paper as 3x stronger than some lesser-known value brands, and I could absolutely feel the difference. Every sheet feels thick, yet soft, making it durable without sacrificing comfort. Even with frequent wiping, it didn‚Äôt tear or dissolve prematurely‚Äîa huge plus for people with sensitive skin like mine.

[Check Cottonelle Ultra Clean Toilet Paper price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b0fcpmlprf/)  

**Effectiveness in Action**  
I tested its claim of removing more in one wipe‚Äîbecause why not? Compared to some budget options I had tried before, it lived up to its promise. The paper seems to grab hold of everything it‚Äôs supposed to without creating an irritating mess. It‚Äôs particularly helpful during ‚Äúmessier‚Äù occasions where you want to minimize repetitive wiping to prevent discomfort. Plus, it somehow feels cleansing rather than abrasive‚Äîa rare thing when it comes to toilet paper.

**Upsides**  
‚Ä¢ Superior CleaningRipples texture that feels effective  
‚Ä¢ Stronger and thicker than most alternatives  
‚Ä¢ Comfortable for sensitive skin  
‚Ä¢ Lasts longer per roll than regular versions  

**Pitfalls**  
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs slightly bulkier in the dispenser, especially for smaller bathrooms  
‚Ä¢ Not the cheapest option on the market, even if it provides value  
‚Ä¢ Packaging could use a bit of an eco-friendly update  

**Longevity and Convenience**  
These family mega rolls claim to last over six times longer than regular rolls, and I have to agree. One roll lasted me almost a week, which is significantly better than I‚Äôm used to. My family didn‚Äôt even manage to tear through it as quickly as they usually do‚Äîeven with the kids pulling off way too many sheets. You get 12 massive rolls in one pack, equating to 66 regular rolls. If restocking less often sounds appealing, this is a major win.

**Hygiene and Septic Safety**  
Toilet paper that‚Äôs strong often makes me nervous about flushing, especially in older plumbing systems, but Cottonelle Ultra Clean is septic-safe, sewer-safe, and clog-resistant. I intentionally threw it into some tough tests to see if my toilet would fight back, and it never did. Those in households prone to clogs (I see you, parents with toddlers) can use this tissue without fear.

**Competing Brands**  
The main challenger to Cottonelle in my stash was Charmin Ultra Strong. While Charmin feels softer, it doesn‚Äôt boast the same kind of effective texturing. On the flip side, it‚Äôs a little less bulky and fits into my bathroom‚Äôs roll holder easier. Meanwhile, budget brands like Scott or the elusive ‚Äústore brands‚Äù simply didn‚Äôt stack up. Stronger doesn‚Äôt always equal scratchy, and Cottonelle delivers strength minus the discomfort. 

**True Value**  
While premium toilet paper often makes you wonder why you're spending more for something that ends up flushed away, this product actually gives you tangible value. Its durability, texture, and longevity justify the cost. The family mega rolls make it even more economical for large households, reducing the frequency of those dreaded ""we‚Äôre out of toilet paper"" emergencies.

I've noticed my PMS symptoms increasing with severity since ending BC, with the most notable symptoms being brain fog, irritability, and anxiety.  BUT the mostly intolerable and noticeable of them all is the extreme levels of fatigue that typically start a few days before my period and can sometimes last throughout my entire cycle of bleeding. 

I'm hardly functioning as I'm writing this, even after getting a full 9 hours of sleep last night, and my period has technically ended. I feel like I pulled an all-nighter.

**Some health stats:**

* I'm not overweight (150 lbs at 5'7"" tall) 
* I drink at least 40 oz of water a day, lightly exercise and walk even on my period
* I only drink 2 cups of coffee a day
* My period is generally heavy (I use a menstrual disc and have been for years), but only lasts 3-4 days max

I don't think it's a matter of my lifestyle that is causing these symptoms. 

**My questions are:**

* Is this considered PMS even if it's lasting throughout my cycle? 
* Is this something I should be seen for? OR
* Are there over-the-counter supplements or vitamins I can take to help support my body during this time?

* The entire article tries to paint India‚Äôs linguistic conflicts as nothing more than emotional tantrums, identity crises, and politically manufactured drama, deliberately ignoring the reality of legitimate resistance. 
* The author **mocks** the perfectly reasonable ask to learn Kannada before moving to Karnataka, by dismissing it as some tired old **JOKE**. 
* Then he drags in Chomsky‚Äôs outdated and frankly bullshit theory, claiming all languages are basically the same, as if that erases cultural and political realities. 
* Finally, he casually throws around the term **‚Äúlinguistic war‚Äù** and blames it on regional pride and political agitation, completely sweeping under the rug the crucial fact that Hindi is institutionally **imposed** on millions across the country. 

# Basically, This article is a thinly veiled attempt to defend Hindi hegemony while silencing and mocking those who stand up for their linguistic rights.

  
This isn‚Äôt some random Tom, Dick, or Harry spouting nonsense on Facebook or any other social media. This is an article straight from **INDIA TODAY**, New Delhi.  
Don‚Äôt be surprised if politicians soon echo this and try to **legalize Hindi imposition,** just like they‚Äôve legalized corruption with electoral bonds.

**Wake up !**

We were under invaders for centuries, under British rule for 200 years, how much longer will we tolerate Hindi hegemony?

1nfa7zr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nfa7zr,A HUGE step for compassionate cuts and homeless outreach,"I‚Äôve spent the past few days looking at vans, the costs of tax and insurance, and how I‚Äôd store items while on the move ‚Äì and it turns out it‚Äôs not as expensive as I first imagined!

To get us on the road ‚Äì buying a van, taxing it, insuring it, and fitting secure storage ‚Äì will cost around ¬£6,000. Small Citro√´n Berlingos are about ¬£3,000, with the rest covering tax, insurance, and storage.

As many of you know, all money that comes into Compassionate Cuts right now goes straight back into the mission ‚Äì travelling to give free haircuts, topping up toiletries, and covering essentials like insurance and sterilising products. I don‚Äôt take a wage, and that‚Äôs okay ‚Äì I started this to make people smile, not to make money. But because of this, there are no savings for a big investment like a van.

Having a van would change everything:
‚ú® It means more time for paid appointments (right now, a 30-minute cut takes me 1.5 hours once you add travel). More appointments = more toiletries bought for those facing homelessness.
‚ú® It makes outreach easier. At the moment, to do one hour at a feeding station (7‚Äì8pm), I‚Äôm out of the house from 5pm until after 10pm, carrying a box, a suitcase, and two bags. A van means I can bring more supplies and give people exactly what they need ‚Äì like deodorant or shaving gear instead of a whole bag they might not use.
‚ú® It gives Compassionate Cuts the freedom to visit more places and attend more events, spreading the word and reaching more people.

I‚Äôve set up a separate fundraiser link so every penny goes only towards the van ‚Äì nothing else. In the background I‚Äôll also be running little fundraisers (coffee mornings, craft fairs, and more), so bear with me for updates.

This van is the next step in growing Compassionate Cuts ‚Äì helping us reach further, carry more, and make an even bigger difference.

*This is a composition of different bits I've written in the past few years, I've put them all together and added pictures*

Three years ago in August 2022 I departed home in the Netherlands for a tour of the Middle East. I covered 22.000km in about four months, through desert and snow, across 22 countries, 15 of which were new to me. I met a large number of amazingly curious and kind people, had one of the worst days of my life struggling with Iraqi bureaucracy, and saw some of the most gorgeous landscapes this planet has to offer. [The Tiger did well](https://i.imgur.com/jTQelSl.jpg), with no problems whatsoever. It had a major service earlier this year, with a new chain and tires (Metzeler Karoo Street) at the start of this trip. I did two oil changes while on the road and that was it basically. I was carrying an assortment of tools and spare parts just in case, but I didn‚Äôt need any of it. Perhaps the [lucky charm](https://i.imgur.com/mck3csu.jpg) that one of my former coworkers knitted for me helped :)

Please forgive me for the meagre amount of photographs. It‚Äôs never been my strong suit, traveling alone I just don‚Äôt stop nearly often enough to take pictures.

**Part 1: Netherlands to Naples**

*All of it was made for you and me / 'Cause it just belongs to you and me / So let's take a ride and see what's mine (Iggy Pop, 1977)*

I left home in August, riding down through Germany to Switzerland and [into](https://i.imgur.com/gXiAYo0.jpg) the [alps](https://i.imgur.com/KUAp03S.jpg). I wanted to do a few hikes around the [ski resorts](https://i.imgur.com/HSX5Mjl.jpg) that I normally only see in winter, and take some of the passes that I hadn‚Äôt so far, notably the [Col Maddelena](https://i.imgur.com/yC8wolo.jpg) and the [Col de la Bonnette](https://i.imgur.com/LAQQeq0.jpg). Also came across the town of Roubion [perched high on a hilltop](https://i.imgur.com/GT8qmDr.jpg). I spent a few days in [Milan](https://i.imgur.com/0l90qMS.jpg) chilling with friends, then headed back up into the Alps to go around the usual suspects, and some of my favorite passes: Albula, Stelvio, and Bernina. East through Austria on the Silvretta, then south through the Brenner, taking the local road this time instead of the motorway, and then south-east by Cortina d‚ÄôAmpezzo towards Venice. I‚Äôd never been to the canal city before, and I was surprised at the size of it. I had imagined something smaller, more bunched up, but it was far larger and more typically Italian than I‚Äôd thought. Dirty abandoned alleys alongside romantic canal side restaurants, beggars and dogs alongside tourists from pretty much all over the world. A nice experience, but not nearly as spectacular as I was made to believe. 

From there on I headed east to visit friends in Hungary, and I got absolutely soaked the last few hours towards Balaton. It was a warm kind of rainstorm thankfully, so not terribly uncomfortable. We spent two days [hiking](https://i.imgur.com/qCJkCHt.jpg) and [sailing](https://i.imgur.com/MvRg7xd.jpg) around Balaton, before I took off again back towards Venice, stopping around Trieste, [Rimini](https://i.imgur.com/oHexagp.jpg), Florence, and [Pisa](https://i.imgur.com/AdDgEG5.jpg), from where I took the [ferry to Corsica](https://i.imgur.com/CmQHNn6.jpg). Northern Italy is quite flat and boring at times, but between San Marino and Florence there are some gorgeous low mountain passes through thick forests and quiet little villages.

Corsica is my first real recommendation to anyone reading this. It‚Äôs French, but don‚Äôt say that too loud, the Corsicans are fiercely independent and [anti-French graffiti](https://i.imgur.com/pfAAgBP.jpg) and posters are everywhere. The island is basically a [mountain range](https://i.imgur.com/x7eQzMW.jpg) [rising from the sea](https://i.imgur.com/L69tTh4.jpg), with [scarcely a straight road around](https://i.imgur.com/qKSOZ4z.jpg). The [coast](https://i.imgur.com/B4Z4bbA.jpg) is mostly [rocky hills](https://i.imgur.com/R8c9oyw.jpg), with innumerable bridges, tunnels, and little seaside villages. [Inland](https://i.imgur.com/EnnXBCu.jpg) is [a bit greener](https://i.imgur.com/yXdebSo.jpg), with scavenging [pigs](https://i.imgur.com/AcAgMEa.jpg) all [around](https://i.imgur.com/zjlHfea.jpg) and sweet hiking trails and a few beautiful [mountain passes](https://i.imgur.com/wHlmsU9.jpg). It's moderately priced too, with affordable BnB‚Äôs and hostels dotted around the cities, campsites throughout the interior, and a tasty twist on French Mediterranean cuisine. It‚Äôs quite small too, and easy to get around despite the curvy madness that is the roads. Whether you like riding, hiking, cycling or simply cruising around taking in the atmosphere, you can‚Äôt really go wrong with Corsica.

From Bonifacio in the south I took the [ferry to Sardegna](https://i.imgur.com/HRfdY39.jpg), which is much larger than Corsica, very Italian, but also culturally distinct from the mainland. The [landscapes](https://i.imgur.com/Jp04Ofd.jpg) are a [bit more varied](https://i.imgur.com/YktQv4u.jpg), with [gorgeous coastlines in the west](https://i.imgur.com/7Z9WMXT.jpg), mountains in the east, and agricultural land and some larger cities in-between. There‚Äôs more to see than just nature though: fascinating megalithic ruins known as the [Nuraghi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuraghe) dot the landscape. Considered ancient ruins already in Roman times, they may have been fortress, house, storage room or temple, their exact purpose remains unknown but there are thousands of them in varying sizes and states of repair all over the island. I found one close to Cagliari that offered a gorgeous view of the city and the harbor. Around Sassari I did a day-long guided [horseback tour](https://i.imgur.com/AroGPqY.jpg). Not having brought my equipment I had to ride in my shorts which seemed like a terrible idea at first, but in the end it didn‚Äôt bother me much. We had an awesome time, riding through farmland across old gravel roads, by ancient churches, and murky pools full of giant tadpoles and salamanders.

In Cagliari I took the ferry to Palermo; a few hours before boarding I came across a French couple in the harbor on a large KTM adventure bike which had battery problems. Together with the Italian AAA we managed to get the bike [loaded on a trailer](https://i.imgur.com/00YtXLc.jpg) and brought to the ship in time for our sailing. The 12 hour boat ride offered a [gorgeous sunset](https://i.imgur.com/NcjTM9L.jpg) and subsequent sunrise again not long after. Once in Palermo the next morning we pushed their bike out the boat to the port where another AAA vehicle was waiting to take it to a garage. 

Now Sicily I was not too impressed with. Palermo and Syracuse are decent enough cities with interesting sights, and here are some exceptional monuments around such as the [Valley of the Temples](https://i.imgur.com/iClcJc0.jpg), [Taormina](https://i.imgur.com/xWKC7MM.jpg), [Siracusa](https://i.imgur.com/UrjsPSJ.jpg), and Piazza Armeria, but in between these highlights the island is poor and filthy. Infrastructure is in an abysmal state, the city peripheries are filthy and stifled with traffic, and lodging and food in the touristy areas is pretty expensive. Giant piles of garbage, plastic, and whatnot are everywhere, as are derelict buildings and abandoned farms and industry. I had a good time, especially the mosaics at Piazza Armeria are [absolutely stunning](https://i.imgur.com/2WryKNl.jpg), and climbing Etna was a unique experience but the entire island gave me a strong feeling of ‚Äòlost potential‚Äô. With just a little more effort and investment it could be an absolutely great destination, but we all know why that isn‚Äôt happening.

From Sicily I took yet another ferry back to the Italian mainland, and slalomed through the [nose of the boot](https://i.imgur.com/JTNc1LU.jpg) towards Naples. [Calabria](https://i.imgur.com/4i4MoAK.jpg) is known for being under Mafia control to a huge degree, perhaps more so than Sicily. It‚Äôs a bit cleaner as well, and features many [pretty mountaintop towns](https://i.imgur.com/2htIGcH.jpg), even the odd ski resort, and [huge forested hill ranges](https://i.imgur.com/KNE7kNc.jpg). Not [an area of Italy](https://i.imgur.com/kFq99cO.jpg) [I was very familiar with](https://i.imgur.com/ZGw6C5A.jpg), it‚Äôs definitely on my list to go back to one day. In Naples I had an appointment with the local Triumph dealer for some maintenance and storage, as I had to fly home for a few days to attend a wedding.

**Part 2: Naples to Kuwait**

*Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command / Your old road is rapidly agin' (Bob Dylan, 1964)*

While all of the above was happening, trouble broke out in Iran. I had my VISA pre-arranged for pickup in Ankara, but not wanting to wait for things to get out of control I decided to make my way there ASAP. The initial plan had been to spend 2-3 weeks going around Greece and Turkey, but that can wait for another time. From Naples again through southern Italy to Bari and Brindisi, and then the [ferry to Igoumenitsa](https://i.imgur.com/hi51lge.jpg) in Greece. Straight shot through Greece to Thessaloniki in the pouring rain, and then into Turkey to Gallipoli. The border was an interesting experience, it‚Äôs basically a long, low bridge with guardhouses every few meters. Border formalities themselves were peanuts, but the sight on the bridge was interesting. The Turks and Greeks have a troubling history, and the guardhouses on each side were manned in full, young lads on the Greek side in full tacticool looking like something out of Call of Duty, whereas the Turks were dressed more like WW1 soldiers, old brown ragged uniforms. As you enter Turkey the differences grow steadily. Donkey carts and ancient tractors on the motor way, but also flashy modern cars. Expensive toll roads and [gas stations with WIFI](https://i.imgur.com/RtFAGhG.jpg), but also tiny villages with what can best be described as huts with sat TV dishes and rusty bicycles.

In Gallipoli harbor with a great view of the absolutely [enormous bridge across the Dardanelles](https://i.imgur.com/uVp4pi6.jpg) I came across a statue of Piri Reis, one of the first scholars to draw up detailed maps of the Mediterranean. I also got to chat with a shopkeeper and one of his sons, who were extremely critical of Erdogan and his ridiculous social and economic policies. The old man proudly showed me the app he had been using to learn English, and he didn‚Äôt mince words. Erdogan is a wannabe dictator, who‚Äôs using religion to control his people. And everywhere you go it‚Äôs there, even the tiniest 10-house village will have a shiny mosque, most likely built quite recently and subsidized by the government. Prayer call is everywhere, but the people in the cities are fed up with it. One of his sons was going off to Ankara to study civil engineering and he was already eyeing a job in Germany. According to them, the younger population is fed up with the conservative bullshit and dictatorial tendencies of the Erdogan and his cronies. They feel powerless however since he has strong support among the clergy and in the rural areas, so when they can they simply leave. 

In Ankara I went to the Iranian embassy to pick up my visa, and everything there was working as usual. Pictures of Khamenei (the religious dictator) and Soleimani (the general assassinated at Baghdad airport by the CIA in January 2020) were all over the waiting room. As the visa had already been granted online there were no questions, just some waiting, payment (75 euros), and pickup. 

From Ankara I went south, through Adana, Gaziantep, [Mardin](https://i.imgur.com/pYlwdrE.jpg) and eventually Yuksekova near the [Iranian border](https://i.imgur.com/UtUcxpu.jpg). The highland around Ankara was cold and windy, the canyon down towards the coast was absolutely gorgeous. Orange trees and olive plantations were everywhere, little farming villages with people working the land and collecting fruits in the orchards. I felt like I had gone 50 years back in time. Heading east the landscape slowly turned desert, the border with first Syria and later Iraq reminding me of Berlin, with giant walls, guard posts, and large swathes of barbed-wire no-mans-land. Everywhere I went and stayed the people were extremely friendly, not all of them spoke English but with google translate as assistance we had many conversations. They echoed the same sentiments as the people in Gallipoli, then again I stayed mostly in the cities. With the collapse of the Turkish Lira (due to Erdogan being an idiot) everything was crazy cheap, and of course Turkish food has a reputation already, so I had a great and affordable time. South-Eastern Turkey between Cizre and [Yuksekova](https://i.imgur.com/QRQiafZ.jpg) felt [desolate, but in a good way](https://i.imgur.com/S3Z32hX.jpg). There‚Äôs hardly any traffic, the road winds round and round the cliffs and gorges that form the border with Iraq. The landscape is beautiful brown/green (copper?) rocks with oases around the places where water collects. There‚Äôs occasional [military base](https://i.imgur.com/3WNzAN1.jpg)s and [checkpoints](https://i.imgur.com/D4umJkf.jpg) on the hilltops and around the passes, but these soldiers were mostly bored and quite surprised to see a traveler come by. I got offered tea a lot, and they wanted to talk about football and other worldly affairs.

The [border with Iran](https://i.imgur.com/kCPGxY4.jpg) was surprisingly easy. No sign of increased security or anything. I got to use the Carnet (import/export document for vehicles) for the first time, which was interesting. Thankfully the customs officer knew exactly what to do with it so the entire crossing was barely a 30-minute affair. Once in Iran I rode into Urmia to try and find a place to change some money, but it was a Friday, the Muslim rest day, so I was SOL since everything was closed. In one of the shopping centers I approached a group of young-ish guys (20-somethings?) and asked if they could help me out, and lo and behold after a short google-translate mediated conversation they arranged for about 50 euro‚Äôs worth of Iranian Rials. Their currency is hilariously worthless, so it came down to about 25 million Rials, a stack [the size of the LOTR single-volume](https://i.imgur.com/KVhMqj7.jpg). 

Everywhere I went in Iran people warned me not to go to the big cities: Tabriz, Tehran et cetera were considered extremely dangerous, as the regime had resorted to outright shooting at the protesters by now. I ended up staying only 4 days in Iran which was a bloody shame, I basically followed the Iraqi border south towards Khorramshahr and then crossed into Iraq. Part of this was Iranian Kurdistan which has historically not been as closely aligned to Tehran (or Baghdad, or Istanbul for that matter) as the rest of the country. Out of dozens upon dozens of encounters with [hotel employees](https://i.imgur.com/QzgkAon.jpg), shopkeepers, [students](https://i.imgur.com/RgUXO8h.jpg), even law enforcement, they all said the same thing more or less. They all want justice for Amini and the countless other killed or hurt by the regime, a lifting of the idiotic religious laws, and more freedoms and opportunities, especially the younger generation. One of the students installed a special VPN on my phone which allowed me to connect to the internet through his mobile hotspot, and at various restaurants and [hotels](https://i.imgur.com/i711CcP.jpg) through WIFI. Even then, the internet often went down for hours at a time. I also came across a rare sight, an [Iranian Suzuki GSXR](https://i.imgur.com/Pkgw21B.jpg), a pretty decent racer. No plates, no helmet, no problem.

[Walking around town](https://i.imgur.com/j7VMd6w.jpg), or just [sitting in a restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/ZYvpUSU.jpg) I got latched on to by groups of younger people wanting to hear about the world and share their story. They feel trapped in their country by the regime, which is plundering the economy and enriching itself at the cost of the population. They don‚Äôt give a shit about Russia, Israel, or the USA, and many are quite moderate when it comes to religion. There weren‚Äôt nearly as many mosques around as in Turkey, and most of the students weren‚Äôt openly religious at all. It was shocking how eager they were to talk about these highly sensitive topics. It gave me a huge blocking feeling of helplessness, hearing these people lament their dictators, wishing, hoping, for a better future where they‚Äôd have a free life, work, be able to travel, be in touch with the world. Keep in mind though this was only in one particular area of the country, the west/northwest along the border with Iraq. I don‚Äôt know if this is representative for the population as a whole. The famous Arab hospitality is all around in Iran as well, multiple times in restaurants other guests stood up and wanted to pay for me, other times people bought me snacks and drinks just for talking to them for a while. I usually tried to accept gracefully and then sneak in payment any way.

In Sanandaj I asked my hotel if it was safe to walk into town to find a restaurant and the lady answered (in fluent English!) that it most certainly wasn‚Äôt, but she could call me a taxi and instruct him to take me by some restaurants? Which I happily agreed to. We drove around town for about two hours, conversing through google translate again. He showed me some monuments, and places were protests had escalated recently, burned out armored vehicles and cars lined the road. Around the main square there were 100+ police and soldiers with big guns (APCs and such) standing around, the giant roundabout next to them full of cars, honking incessantly as a provocation. Some of the drivers even yelled at the police, it was a frightening scene. We then went to a little restaurant to eat kebabs, and the driver showed me pictures of an older man from his neighborhood, who had been shot the week before during a protest. Some girl had lain injured in the street and the old guy (60, 70?) had ran out to help her and they‚Äôd just gunned down both of them. He told me that he didn‚Äôt expect these protests to die down easily, because so many people had been killed and hurt: every time they have a funeral, the victims friends and family gathers, and the anger flares up again. Same with the 40-day Shia mourning period, after which they meet again and the same thing happens. Later that night there were gunshots and explosions in town, about 1-2 miles from my hotel. My heart breaks for these people. It‚Äôs going to take a lot of bloodshed, but I hope they get the freedoms they so strongly desire, and are willing to die for.

As for the riding, Iran is absolutely huge, and has hugely varied landscapes and I‚Äôve only been to a small part of it. The northwest is a [high plateau dotted with hills](https://i.imgur.com/3OJLulW.jpg), mountains to the west in Turkey, and with a large salt lake next to Urmia. Due to climate change the once enormous lake is now little more than a huge salt flat with some wet spots. Towards the south are beautiful hills and [mountain ranges](https://i.imgur.com/fGBXEDB.jpg), canyons, dry riverbeds, and occasional agriculture. As I went further south the landscape slowly became flatter, with [large-scale agriculture](https://i.imgur.com/THOqFYN.jpg) and huge irrigation projects around. Even further south around the Persian Gulf it becomes a proper desert, scorching hot during the day, cool in the nights. [Giant oil refineries](https://i.imgur.com/Iz1asQP.jpg) tower over enormous featureless deserts, long roads with barely any traffic going seemingly nowhere, vanishing into the horizon. [Infrastructure is generally good](https://i.imgur.com/Pu80g7Y.jpg), roads are decent and there‚Äôs even AAA around, trucks with towing equipment providing roadside assistance (indicative of a fairly sophisticated society, in my book). Gas is only about 5 cents a liter, and every time you stop people want to make conversation, you‚Äôre offered tea, baclava, snacks, people want to take pictures with you ‚Äì but at the same time it maintains a certain kind of innocence. There aren‚Äôt a whole lot of tourists in Iran outside the main cities, and I had several people including gas station attendants come up to me shyly, asking in their best English where I was from, what I thought of their country, and if they could please take a photo with me? It was almost endearing at times. Gave me goosebumps, especially considering the international isolation, economic problems, and murderous dictatorship bullshit these people are going through. Not a single time did I feel unsafe, even the more serious looking Basiji/Revolutionary Guard checkpoints were generally courteous and speedy. One thing I‚Äôd like to add here is how forward-thinking the hospitality of many of these people was. From Turkey to Qatar all the way to Israel I got offered more than a dozen phone numbers, with the following reasoning: ‚ÄúHere, take my number. If you‚Äôre ever in front of someone who doesn‚Äôt speak English, call me, give them the phone, and I will translate for you‚Äù. 

In Khorramabad I got spooked a bit, and decided not to stretch my luck and go straight to the Iraqi border and on to Kuwait the next day. Getting out of Iran was easy, but getting into Iraq ended up a crazy struggle with bureaucracy. [I recorded the story later that night](https://soundcloud.com/user909842478/bureaucracy-and-humanity/s-mH9rQ1jaxe2?si=d926794ac5d9418c8fe6d9eb8c8c6d13) in my hotel in Kuwait. It‚Äôs a bit of a long sit at 30 minutes, but if you want to hear a crazy tale of foreign border crossings it might be worth it.

From the audio story: [this is what the Kuwaiti highway 80 looked like](https://i.imgur.com/xtWWEXn.jpg) after the chaotic Iraqi withdrawal during the Gulf War, during which their columns got annihilated by the USAF. Also, [the Kuwaiti customs officials that helped me so nicely](https://i.imgur.com/9pqvmE5.jpg).



**Part 3: Kuwait to Jordan**

*You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name / It felt good to be out of the rain (America, 1971)*

From Kuwait I went on through Saudi Arabia (KSA), to Bahrain and Qatar. Kuwait city wasn‚Äôt very appealing, the city is huge and nobody walks, everyone drives their giant fucking cars everywhere, even though gas isn‚Äôt particularly cheap at about 50 cents a liter. I spent some time around the [water front](https://i.imgur.com/OLqGMW0.jpg) and in the old markets, but [walking around the city](https://i.imgur.com/s74j5ty.jpg) was a PITA because [everything is designed around cars and cars only](https://i.imgur.com/ZCMt7qU.jpg), they really took the wrong lessons from the Americans that stayed after the war. There are some monuments and minor other interesting buildings around, but apart from that it feels like the business district of any other major city. [At least their money is very pretty](https://i.imgur.com/MujG89H.jpg). Two things happened in Kuwait that I want to describe in a little more detail.

When I pulled up to my hotel (City Tower Kuwait, at 80$ a night one of the cheapest hotels in town) a short man with a little black-and-white hat greets me enthusiastically, and gestures where he'd like me to park. Despite my best attempts to dissuade him he insists on carrying my bags to the elevator after I've checked in, and explains that I can use the wheelchair ramp to park the motorcycle right next to the entrance where the reception can keep an eye on it twenty-four-seven. Later, after I've showered the desert sand out of my hair I come across him taking note of the cars parked in front of the hotel in a little booklet. He's impressed with the motorcycle and brings me tea while I sit down to clean and grease the chain. His name is Bahad from Nepal, and he has been in Kuwait for five years now, working for the same hotel all that time. First as room service and cleaner, now as parking attendant and customer representative. The entire country runs on immigrant labor: native Kuwaiti people receive a handsome stipend from the government simply for existing, and as a result they tend not to do any labor. They own most of the businesses though, while people like Bahad do the actual work.

The next morning I went to the Yamaha dealership for an oil change. The service representative initially refuses because my bike is a Triumph and not a Yamaha, but since I got the new filter with me and oil is, well, oil, I convince him to call his boss for me. Essa, a Kuwaiti, raises his eyebrows after seeing my license plate, then shakes my hand warmly and assures me that everything will be alright. His mechanics will take good care of my bike he promises, and asks if I would prefer tea, coffee, or an iced beverage while I wait. I watch as the Indian mechanics roll the bike into the shop, and after receiving a mug of fresh coffee from the garage's bartender I follow them inside. The fully blind shop cat is purring away in the corner, while several machines are being worked on. A Yamaha racer stands gutted on one of the lifts, its engine being revised on the table next to it. Two workers are busy installing floodlights onto a shiny new dune buggy. After the [oil change](https://i.imgur.com/1btpfgH.jpg) the Indian crew checks the tire pressure and fluids, then gives the bike a [thorough wash](https://i.imgur.com/WWMdtV1.jpg) outside in the courtyard, while I stroll around the showroom admiring all the latest motorcycles, generators, and golf carts that Yamaha has to offer. When it's finally time to leave I ask Essa if they accept VISA cards. ""No"", he says. ""There's nothing to pay, this is a gift"".

That night I meet Bahad again in the lobby. It's quiet, and he has time to chat. I ask him about his life in Nepal and his work here in Kuwait city, and he indulges my naivety with extreme politeness. He works five 10-hour shifts a week for 140 Kuwaiti Dinar or about 500 dollars a month. The hotel provides lodging and clothes, and the employees are allowed to take home any leftovers from the daily breakfast buffet. He much prefers the clean hotel environment over construction work, even though the latter pays better. Every day before heading to his little apartment he fills a jerrycan with drinking water from the giant filter in the hotel basement, greatly reducing his living expenses. He sends home most of his salary and the tips he receives. He's not married, but the money provides for his widowed sister and her three children. Nearly 5000 dollars in the past year he explains, beaming with pride.

Crossing from [Kuwait into KSA](https://i.imgur.com/dOQjqOo.jpg) was easy, Kuwait uses the Carnet but KSA has their own vehicle registration system. It took them a few minutes to correctly register my plate as the system kept trying to input it right-to-left the Arabic way, but overall it didn‚Äôt take long. I had my visa pre-arranged, the conditions of which were pretty awesome (140 dollars for a 12-month multiple entry visa including health insurance), and every KSA crossing I did had at least one person who spoke more than a bit of English. I got a lot of interested looks at these border posts, people wanting to take pictures, handing me water, and snacks. They only know my country as ‚ÄòHulanda‚Äô in Arabic, so I often had to explain what the NL on my plate stood for.

Bahrain is a fascinating place, a little island nation connected to KSA through a long causeway built in the 80‚Äôies by Dutch company Ballast Nedam. Bahrain discovered long ago that oil revenues don‚Äôt last forever, and they started attracting business and tourists with a huge financial sector, giant malls, and the GP of course. Saudis refer to it as the Las Vegas of the Middle East. Despite it being essentially a Muslim Emirate there‚Äôs pork, [alcohol](https://i.imgur.com/EelXbrB.jpg), night clubs, [weird souvenirs](https://i.imgur.com/ajdZhPY.jpg), and even prostitution. KSA prohibits most of these things, and as a result Bahrain is filled to the brim with Saudi tourists coming over for a few days to have their fill, then heading off into piety again. It appears that KSA has significant control over the Bahraini government, and both are mostly happy with the arrangement. Riyadh knows that it‚Äôs impossible to completely forbid these things, and they much prefer having them in a controlled environment just off the coast, behind a border, so they can keep up the pretense of purity for their own country.

As a result of all this tourism the KSA-Bahraini border is extremely efficient and speedy. It‚Äôs essentially a stop along the highway, which by definition means there‚Äôs no space or time for extended controls or they‚Äôll just cause a massive traffic jam. Visa is on arrival, 5 bucks, and you can even pay by card lmao. The bike was a little more work, I had to walk into the customs office to get the Carnet stamped. An older officer pointed me to a desk with a very young girl in uniform behind it, she had never seen a Carnet before so me and the old guy talked her through it. Both spoke decent English and were very friendly, and I got the usual offerings of tea and bottled water.

The capital Manama is a strange place, it was murderously hot so walking around town I was ducking into air conditioned bus stops (!) and coffee shops to cool down. Everything is expensive but not terribly so, and at the same time there‚Äôs the same business-district-blandness to most of it. Except for the old town with numerous shops and markets, delicious food from all over the world, and lots of life in the street. I talked to some of the migrant workers in the restaurants and one of them told me loads of Saudis come to Manama to get wasted, then wreck their car drunk driving, but they just scrap it and buy a new one in Damman before heading back home. The scenes on the streets were more varied than in KSA or Kuwait, lots of families from different backgrounds. It was interesting to see that even Saudi men, wearing their Thawb, the formal white robe, have girlfriends or wives, and children that they show affection for when their environment allows for it. My stupid Western brain never really considered this. Dress for women ranged from all-covered for the pious Muslims to not covered at all for most tourists and migrant workers, and everything in between.

From Bahrain I rode back through KSA [to Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/mdd6v9A.jpg). Too early for and not much to do with the World Cup, I just wanted to [see](https://i.imgur.com/fUFFTWi.jpg) the [place](https://i.imgur.com/GpPzMTU.jpg) I guess. It‚Äôs only a hundred miles as the crow flies from Manama to Doha, but there‚Äôs a huge bay in-between which means it took all day. KSA borders were friendly and efficient as before, but the Qatari customs messed with my Carnet, tore out an entire page and refused to elaborate. I took some pictures and a video and contacted ADAC that evening but they said it should be OK. The customs guys got really upset when while filming the Carnet, I lifted the camera up, and demanded I delete the footage. But they didn‚Äôt make me empty the recycle bin lol.

[Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/ZPAT8Yv.jpg) is largely similar to Kuwait, one single big city with not much around, cars everywhere. The Qataris themselves are rich, and [migrants do all the work](https://i.imgur.com/vhTtUtR.jpg). You‚Äôve seen the stories surrounding the world cup no doubt. Doha was also scorching hot, but thankfully a bit easier to walk around than Kuwait City. One month before the WC started there was construction going on everywhere, day and night. The stadiums were pretty much finished but they were still building hotels, walkways, parks, and god knows what else. I talked to some of the Indian workers and they confirmed pretty much everything the news has been saying about Qatar, but they also said they weren‚Äôt entirely unhappy with the situation. They make good money to send home, they get lots of breaks during the hottest parts of the day, and food and lodging is taken care of, depending on which company they work for. It‚Äôs hard work for (looking from the West) meagre pay, but they come here because it‚Äôs much better than what they‚Äôd get back home. Doha again is a pretty bland city, the [old Souk Waaqif](https://i.imgur.com/q0Nw7Bh.jpg) is interesting to walk around with loads of [little shops and craftsmen](https://i.imgur.com/Xrt822d.jpg), but it‚Äôs also extremely touristic and expensive. The best place to me was the [Museum of Islamic Art](https://i.imgur.com/dSQEo2D.jpg), which had a lot of fascinating artefacts and stories from [all over the Middle East](https://i.imgur.com/J7lt9mY.jpg). In Qatar I also came across a [Saudi football fan](https://i.imgur.com/wW7dUSX.jpg) who had been hiking through the desert for months to make it to Doha for the world cup. Even the police wanted to [take pictures with him](https://i.imgur.com/RLLIZkq.jpg).

Now by the time I was in Doha I had started thinking of my return leg. I got some worrying messages that Ethiopia had pretty much closed its borders to foreign motor vehicles, demanding tens of thousands of dollars as collateral at the border. I had really wanted to go to Egypt, but that also was quite expensive to arrange, and then I‚Äôd have the problem of getting the bike out. Transport by air is crazy expensive (5000 to 7000 dollars, plus needs to be drained of all fluids), so I decided to dig into my contact list for an alternative option. Someone had suggested to me some time ago that it‚Äôs possible to ship vehicles from Israel to Greece on a RORO transport (meaning vehicles only, no passengers), which is far cheaper than flying. So I got in touch with Rosenfeld Shipping in Haifa, who informed me they had a weekly service to Lavrion in Greece, which for a motorcycle would only be about 700 dollars. That seemed mighty fine to me, so off towards Haifa I went. 

From Doha to the Jordan border is nearly 2000km, [straight through the desert](https://i.imgur.com/hpJa4s5.jpg). It took me [three day](https://i.imgur.com/RoEBXYc.jpg)s, first to Riyadh, then Hail, and lastly Qurayyat. I was carrying about [3L of water and some food](https://i.imgur.com/3JLBE59.jpg), and even though I was drinking a lot in the desert I never got in trouble in KSA, there‚Äôs always a bit of traffic around and it‚Äôs easy to stock up at gas stations. Although it was a similar [desert](https://i.imgur.com/3cbkMeb.jpg) to Western Sahara it felt much more [‚Äòcivilized‚Äô](https://i.imgur.com/mawQYXp.jpg) because of this. I really wish I could‚Äôve [stayed a bit longer](https://i.imgur.com/bTdC9W9.jpg) in KSA because it‚Äôs a fascinating place. Politically and religiously it‚Äôs obviously a disgusting mess, but the landscapes are spectacular, the people are almost crazy friendly, and riding through the desert for so long really is a boring yet also fascinating experience. [Hours upon hours of nothingness](https://i.imgur.com/7FzOtxN.jpg), even [gas stations](https://i.imgur.com/aB9sisb.jpg) are rare, with sometimes 200+ km between them. There is occasional traffic, and the truck drivers honk and wave back. Giant power lines follow the roads and camels are everywhere. Concrete husks of old gas stations, guard posts and other things are occasionally seen on the side of the road. But above all there is sand, silence, and asphalt. I got lucky with the weather. It was hot but not outrageously so, around 30 degrees during the day, and I even caught a speck of rain around Hail. Also a sandstorm just west of Riyadh which was surreal, everything around you dark yellow and brown, the road below and the sky above covered in streams of sand and dust.

People in the street [looked at me with great interest](https://i.imgur.com/MWKPNDb.jpg) and wanted to talk a lot. In Hail I met a group of Saudi and Chinese visitors who worked in some manufacturing industry who fawned over the bike and wanted to know all about my trip. I ran out of Saudi Riyals in Qurayyat on Thursday evening, and walked into town trying to find a place to get something to eat. On the way a Saudi driver hailed me, guy in a big Pajero, traditional dress. He asked if I was a tourist (yes), and how I was enjoying KSA so far (fine). He asked if I needed anything? So I said well, I need to change some euro‚Äôs for Riyals, about 50 euro‚Äôs worth? He got out his phone and worked out that would be about 175 Riyals. So he took out his wallet and handed me 350 Riyals in exchange for my 50 euros. I tried to convince him otherwise but he wasn‚Äôt having it, so he literally just gave me 50 euro‚Äôs for nothing. He just wanted me to have a good time and be able to buy food and pay for the fees at the border the next day. The hospitality of some of these people truly boggles the mind.

The border with Jordan was rather easy, if expensive. One Jordanian Dinar is about 1 euro 50, and it cost a small fortune to cross: visa (40JD), motorcycle (20JD), motorcycle insurance (36JD), SIM card (14JD). In Jordan I went down the length of the country towards Wadi Rum that same day, on highway 5 through the (Jordanian) Eastern Desert. Like KSA this part of the country was extremely sparsely populated, but at one point I randomly came across two dozen bikes parked on the side of the road and a bunch of guys having lunch. Turned out to be the Amman Motorcycle Club on their weekly tour. They even had a follow car with fuel, water, and a trailer for emergencies. As soon as I stopped I was swarmed by these [jovial guys](https://i.imgur.com/SnYUgpX.jpg) and they immediately handed me some water and snickers bars. We spent some time chatting and eating before going our separate ways. 

Jordan is the second recommendation I'd like to make. The country is small, the parts worth visiting are relatively close together. [Wadi Rum](https://i.imgur.com/CXC89O9.jpg) and [Petra](https://i.imgur.com/Rg4TVlj.jpg) have long been famous and they are worth every second and every penny. It is truly a wonderful, elating feeling to [ride around the desert](https://i.imgur.com/LDDIM4b.jpg) [between the colossal red mesa-like rocks](https://i.imgur.com/aVKe8Tg.jpg) in all sorts of fascinating shapes at Wadi Rum. Petra instead is human made, ‚Äòthe rose-colored city half as old as time itself‚Äô. Already famous in Roman times its location was ‚Äòlost‚Äô for a bit until being rediscovered last century. An entire city worth of buildings, caves, dwellings, [temples](https://i.imgur.com/feeWyot.jpg) carved out of red sandstone, with a fascinating water management system and a huge amphitheater to top it off. From Petra on I rode north following the Dead Sea. The roads across the central Jordanian mountain range were very pretty and [very quiet](https://i.imgur.com/kTLeOqz.jpg). Further north there were lots of kitschy shops selling Dead Sea sand, mud, face masks, all that jazz. Closer to Amman there suddenly was a lot of traffic, and the city itself is massive and sprawling, there‚Äôs not a lot of high rise so with 4 million people it covers a mind-boggling area. I spent a few days there and around Jerash. Amman has loads of interesting sights as well as a pretty decent street and night life, I went to see the Jordan Museum which had some really nice exhibitions and [historical artifacts](https://i.imgur.com/27s8IrM.jpg), the original [Hejaz railway station](https://i.imgur.com/Xpp4EFK.jpg), as well as the Citadel which offers great views of the city center. Jerash has a huge archaeological park with a well preserved [Roman street](https://i.imgur.com/31LjZHW.jpg), and the surrounding hills are dotted with villages and olive orchards. Riding around this part of Jordan isn‚Äôt super interesting in an of itself, it was fairly wet and cold while I was there and the roads are super busy.",0,1757700060.0,motorcycle,2,0.5,False

*This is a composition of different bits I've written in the past few years, I've put them all together and added pictures*

Three years ago in August 2022 I departed home in the Netherlands for a tour of the Middle East. I covered 22.000km in about four months, through desert and snow, across 22 countries, 15 of which were new to me. I met a large number of amazingly curious and kind people, had one of the worst days of my life struggling with Iraqi bureaucracy, and saw some of the most gorgeous landscapes this planet has to offer. [The Tiger did well](https://i.imgur.com/jTQelSl.jpg), with no problems whatsoever. It had a major service earlier this year, with a new chain and tires (Metzeler Karoo Street) at the start of this trip. I did two oil changes while on the road and that was it basically. I was carrying an assortment of tools and spare parts just in case, but I didn‚Äôt need any of it. Perhaps the [lucky charm](https://i.imgur.com/mck3csu.jpg) that one of my former coworkers knitted for me helped :)

Please forgive me for the meagre amount of photographs. It‚Äôs never been my strong suit, traveling alone I just don‚Äôt stop nearly often enough to take pictures.

**Part 1: Netherlands to Naples**

*All of it was made for you and me / 'Cause it just belongs to you and me / So let's take a ride and see what's mine (Iggy Pop, 1977)*

I left home in August, riding down through Germany to Switzerland and [into](https://i.imgur.com/gXiAYo0.jpg) the [alps](https://i.imgur.com/KUAp03S.jpg). I wanted to do a few hikes around the [ski resorts](https://i.imgur.com/HSX5Mjl.jpg) that I normally only see in winter, and take some of the passes that I hadn‚Äôt so far, notably the [Col Maddelena](https://i.imgur.com/yC8wolo.jpg) and the [Col de la Bonnette](https://i.imgur.com/LAQQeq0.jpg). Also came across the town of Roubion [perched high on a hilltop](https://i.imgur.com/GT8qmDr.jpg). I spent a few days in [Milan](https://i.imgur.com/0l90qMS.jpg) chilling with friends, then headed back up into the Alps to go around the usual suspects, and some of my favorite passes: Albula, Stelvio, and Bernina. East through Austria on the Silvretta, then south through the Brenner, taking the local road this time instead of the motorway, and then south-east by Cortina d‚ÄôAmpezzo towards Venice. I‚Äôd never been to the canal city before, and I was surprised at the size of it. I had imagined something smaller, more bunched up, but it was far larger and more typically Italian than I‚Äôd thought. Dirty abandoned alleys alongside romantic canal side restaurants, beggars and dogs alongside tourists from pretty much all over the world. A nice experience, but not nearly as spectacular as I was made to believe. 

From there on I headed east to visit friends in Hungary, and I got absolutely soaked the last few hours towards Balaton. It was a warm kind of rainstorm thankfully, so not terribly uncomfortable. We spent two days [hiking](https://i.imgur.com/qCJkCHt.jpg) and [sailing](https://i.imgur.com/MvRg7xd.jpg) around Balaton, before I took off again back towards Venice, stopping around Trieste, [Rimini](https://i.imgur.com/oHexagp.jpg), Florence, and [Pisa](https://i.imgur.com/AdDgEG5.jpg), from where I took the [ferry to Corsica](https://i.imgur.com/CmQHNn6.jpg). Northern Italy is quite flat and boring at times, but between San Marino and Florence there are some gorgeous low mountain passes through thick forests and quiet little villages.

Corsica is my first real recommendation to anyone reading this. It‚Äôs French, but don‚Äôt say that too loud, the Corsicans are fiercely independent and [anti-French graffiti](https://i.imgur.com/pfAAgBP.jpg) and posters are everywhere. The island is basically a [mountain range](https://i.imgur.com/x7eQzMW.jpg) [rising from the sea](https://i.imgur.com/L69tTh4.jpg), with [scarcely a straight road around](https://i.imgur.com/qKSOZ4z.jpg). The [coast](https://i.imgur.com/B4Z4bbA.jpg) is mostly [rocky hills](https://i.imgur.com/R8c9oyw.jpg), with innumerable bridges, tunnels, and little seaside villages. [Inland](https://i.imgur.com/EnnXBCu.jpg) is [a bit greener](https://i.imgur.com/yXdebSo.jpg), with scavenging [pigs](https://i.imgur.com/AcAgMEa.jpg) all [around](https://i.imgur.com/zjlHfea.jpg) and sweet hiking trails and a few beautiful [mountain passes](https://i.imgur.com/wHlmsU9.jpg). It's moderately priced too, with affordable BnB‚Äôs and hostels dotted around the cities, campsites throughout the interior, and a tasty twist on French Mediterranean cuisine. It‚Äôs quite small too, and easy to get around despite the curvy madness that is the roads. Whether you like riding, hiking, cycling or simply cruising around taking in the atmosphere, you can‚Äôt really go wrong with Corsica.

From Bonifacio in the south I took the [ferry to Sardegna](https://i.imgur.com/HRfdY39.jpg), which is much larger than Corsica, very Italian, but also culturally distinct from the mainland. The [landscapes](https://i.imgur.com/Jp04Ofd.jpg) are a [bit more varied](https://i.imgur.com/YktQv4u.jpg), with [gorgeous coastlines in the west](https://i.imgur.com/7Z9WMXT.jpg), mountains in the east, and agricultural land and some larger cities in-between. There‚Äôs more to see than just nature though: fascinating megalithic ruins known as the [Nuraghi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuraghe) dot the landscape. Considered ancient ruins already in Roman times, they may have been fortress, house, storage room or temple, their exact purpose remains unknown but there are thousands of them in varying sizes and states of repair all over the island. I found one close to Cagliari that offered a gorgeous view of the city and the harbor. Around Sassari I did a day-long guided [horseback tour](https://i.imgur.com/AroGPqY.jpg). Not having brought my equipment I had to ride in my shorts which seemed like a terrible idea at first, but in the end it didn‚Äôt bother me much. We had an awesome time, riding through farmland across old gravel roads, by ancient churches, and murky pools full of giant tadpoles and salamanders.

In Cagliari I took the ferry to Palermo; a few hours before boarding I came across a French couple in the harbor on a large KTM adventure bike which had battery problems. Together with the Italian AAA we managed to get the bike [loaded on a trailer](https://i.imgur.com/00YtXLc.jpg) and brought to the ship in time for our sailing. The 12 hour boat ride offered a [gorgeous sunset](https://i.imgur.com/NcjTM9L.jpg) and subsequent sunrise again not long after. Once in Palermo the next morning we pushed their bike out the boat to the port where another AAA vehicle was waiting to take it to a garage. 

Now Sicily I was not too impressed with. Palermo and Syracuse are decent enough cities with interesting sights, and here are some exceptional monuments around such as the [Valley of the Temples](https://i.imgur.com/iClcJc0.jpg), [Taormina](https://i.imgur.com/xWKC7MM.jpg), [Siracusa](https://i.imgur.com/UrjsPSJ.jpg), and Piazza Armeria, but in between these highlights the island is poor and filthy. Infrastructure is in an abysmal state, the city peripheries are filthy and stifled with traffic, and lodging and food in the touristy areas is pretty expensive. Giant piles of garbage, plastic, and whatnot are everywhere, as are derelict buildings and abandoned farms and industry. I had a good time, especially the mosaics at Piazza Armeria are [absolutely stunning](https://i.imgur.com/2WryKNl.jpg), and climbing Etna was a unique experience but the entire island gave me a strong feeling of ‚Äòlost potential‚Äô. With just a little more effort and investment it could be an absolutely great destination, but we all know why that isn‚Äôt happening.

From Sicily I took yet another ferry back to the Italian mainland, and slalomed through the [nose of the boot](https://i.imgur.com/JTNc1LU.jpg) towards Naples. [Calabria](https://i.imgur.com/4i4MoAK.jpg) is known for being under Mafia control to a huge degree, perhaps more so than Sicily. It‚Äôs a bit cleaner as well, and features many [pretty mountaintop towns](https://i.imgur.com/2htIGcH.jpg), even the odd ski resort, and [huge forested hill ranges](https://i.imgur.com/KNE7kNc.jpg). Not [an area of Italy](https://i.imgur.com/kFq99cO.jpg) [I was very familiar with](https://i.imgur.com/ZGw6C5A.jpg), it‚Äôs definitely on my list to go back to one day. In Naples I had an appointment with the local Triumph dealer for some maintenance and storage, as I had to fly home for a few days to attend a wedding.

**Part 2: Naples to Kuwait**

*Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command / Your old road is rapidly agin' (Bob Dylan, 1964)*

While all of the above was happening, trouble broke out in Iran. I had my VISA pre-arranged for pickup in Ankara, but not wanting to wait for things to get out of control I decided to make my way there ASAP. The initial plan had been to spend 2-3 weeks going around Greece and Turkey, but that can wait for another time. From Naples again through southern Italy to Bari and Brindisi, and then the [ferry to Igoumenitsa](https://i.imgur.com/hi51lge.jpg) in Greece. Straight shot through Greece to Thessaloniki in the pouring rain, and then into Turkey to Gallipoli. The border was an interesting experience, it‚Äôs basically a long, low bridge with guardhouses every few meters. Border formalities themselves were peanuts, but the sight on the bridge was interesting. The Turks and Greeks have a troubling history, and the guardhouses on each side were manned in full, young lads on the Greek side in full tacticool looking like something out of Call of Duty, whereas the Turks were dressed more like WW1 soldiers, old brown ragged uniforms. As you enter Turkey the differences grow steadily. Donkey carts and ancient tractors on the motor way, but also flashy modern cars. Expensive toll roads and [gas stations with WIFI](https://i.imgur.com/RtFAGhG.jpg), but also tiny villages with what can best be described as huts with sat TV dishes and rusty bicycles.

In Gallipoli harbor with a great view of the absolutely [enormous bridge across the Dardanelles](https://i.imgur.com/uVp4pi6.jpg) I came across a statue of Piri Reis, one of the first scholars to draw up detailed maps of the Mediterranean. I also got to chat with a shopkeeper and one of his sons, who were extremely critical of Erdogan and his ridiculous social and economic policies. The old man proudly showed me the app he had been using to learn English, and he didn‚Äôt mince words. Erdogan is a wannabe dictator, who‚Äôs using religion to control his people. And everywhere you go it‚Äôs there, even the tiniest 10-house village will have a shiny mosque, most likely built quite recently and subsidized by the government. Prayer call is everywhere, but the people in the cities are fed up with it. One of his sons was going off to Ankara to study civil engineering and he was already eyeing a job in Germany. According to them, the younger population is fed up with the conservative bullshit and dictatorial tendencies of the Erdogan and his cronies. They feel powerless however since he has strong support among the clergy and in the rural areas, so when they can they simply leave. 

In Ankara I went to the Iranian embassy to pick up my visa, and everything there was working as usual. Pictures of Khamenei (the religious dictator) and Soleimani (the general assassinated at Baghdad airport by the CIA in January 2020) were all over the waiting room. As the visa had already been granted online there were no questions, just some waiting, payment (75 euros), and pickup. 

From Ankara I went south, through Adana, Gaziantep, [Mardin](https://i.imgur.com/pYlwdrE.jpg) and eventually Yuksekova near the [Iranian border](https://i.imgur.com/UtUcxpu.jpg). The highland around Ankara was cold and windy, the canyon down towards the coast was absolutely gorgeous. Orange trees and olive plantations were everywhere, little farming villages with people working the land and collecting fruits in the orchards. I felt like I had gone 50 years back in time. Heading east the landscape slowly turned desert, the border with first Syria and later Iraq reminding me of Berlin, with giant walls, guard posts, and large swathes of barbed-wire no-mans-land. Everywhere I went and stayed the people were extremely friendly, not all of them spoke English but with google translate as assistance we had many conversations. They echoed the same sentiments as the people in Gallipoli, then again I stayed mostly in the cities. With the collapse of the Turkish Lira (due to Erdogan being an idiot) everything was crazy cheap, and of course Turkish food has a reputation already, so I had a great and affordable time. South-Eastern Turkey between Cizre and [Yuksekova](https://i.imgur.com/QRQiafZ.jpg) felt [desolate, but in a good way](https://i.imgur.com/S3Z32hX.jpg). There‚Äôs hardly any traffic, the road winds round and round the cliffs and gorges that form the border with Iraq. The landscape is beautiful brown/green (copper?) rocks with oases around the places where water collects. There‚Äôs occasional [military base](https://i.imgur.com/3WNzAN1.jpg)s and [checkpoints](https://i.imgur.com/D4umJkf.jpg) on the hilltops and around the passes, but these soldiers were mostly bored and quite surprised to see a traveler come by. I got offered tea a lot, and they wanted to talk about football and other worldly affairs.

The [border with Iran](https://i.imgur.com/kCPGxY4.jpg) was surprisingly easy. No sign of increased security or anything. I got to use the Carnet (import/export document for vehicles) for the first time, which was interesting. Thankfully the customs officer knew exactly what to do with it so the entire crossing was barely a 30-minute affair. Once in Iran I rode into Urmia to try and find a place to change some money, but it was a Friday, the Muslim rest day, so I was SOL since everything was closed. In one of the shopping centers I approached a group of young-ish guys (20-somethings?) and asked if they could help me out, and lo and behold after a short google-translate mediated conversation they arranged for about 50 euro‚Äôs worth of Iranian Rials. Their currency is hilariously worthless, so it came down to about 25 million Rials, a stack [the size of the LOTR single-volume](https://i.imgur.com/KVhMqj7.jpg). 

Everywhere I went in Iran people warned me not to go to the big cities: Tabriz, Tehran et cetera were considered extremely dangerous, as the regime had resorted to outright shooting at the protesters by now. I ended up staying only 4 days in Iran which was a bloody shame, I basically followed the Iraqi border south towards Khorramshahr and then crossed into Iraq. Part of this was Iranian Kurdistan which has historically not been as closely aligned to Tehran (or Baghdad, or Istanbul for that matter) as the rest of the country. Out of dozens upon dozens of encounters with [hotel employees](https://i.imgur.com/QzgkAon.jpg), shopkeepers, [students](https://i.imgur.com/RgUXO8h.jpg), even law enforcement, they all said the same thing more or less. They all want justice for Amini and the countless other killed or hurt by the regime, a lifting of the idiotic religious laws, and more freedoms and opportunities, especially the younger generation. One of the students installed a special VPN on my phone which allowed me to connect to the internet through his mobile hotspot, and at various restaurants and [hotels](https://i.imgur.com/i711CcP.jpg) through WIFI. Even then, the internet often went down for hours at a time. I also came across a rare sight, an [Iranian Suzuki GSXR](https://i.imgur.com/Pkgw21B.jpg), a pretty decent racer. No plates, no helmet, no problem.

[Walking around town](https://i.imgur.com/j7VMd6w.jpg), or just [sitting in a restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/ZYvpUSU.jpg) I got latched on to by groups of younger people wanting to hear about the world and share their story. They feel trapped in their country by the regime, which is plundering the economy and enriching itself at the cost of the population. They don‚Äôt give a shit about Russia, Israel, or the USA, and many are quite moderate when it comes to religion. There weren‚Äôt nearly as many mosques around as in Turkey, and most of the students weren‚Äôt openly religious at all. It was shocking how eager they were to talk about these highly sensitive topics. It gave me a huge blocking feeling of helplessness, hearing these people lament their dictators, wishing, hoping, for a better future where they‚Äôd have a free life, work, be able to travel, be in touch with the world. Keep in mind though this was only in one particular area of the country, the west/northwest along the border with Iraq. I don‚Äôt know if this is representative for the population as a whole. The famous Arab hospitality is all around in Iran as well, multiple times in restaurants other guests stood up and wanted to pay for me, other times people bought me snacks and drinks just for talking to them for a while. I usually tried to accept gracefully and then sneak in payment any way.

In Sanandaj I asked my hotel if it was safe to walk into town to find a restaurant and the lady answered (in fluent English!) that it most certainly wasn‚Äôt, but she could call me a taxi and instruct him to take me by some restaurants? Which I happily agreed to. We drove around town for about two hours, conversing through google translate again. He showed me some monuments, and places were protests had escalated recently, burned out armored vehicles and cars lined the road. Around the main square there were 100+ police and soldiers with big guns (APCs and such) standing around, the giant roundabout next to them full of cars, honking incessantly as a provocation. Some of the drivers even yelled at the police, it was a frightening scene. We then went to a little restaurant to eat kebabs, and the driver showed me pictures of an older man from his neighborhood, who had been shot the week before during a protest. Some girl had lain injured in the street and the old guy (60, 70?) had ran out to help her and they‚Äôd just gunned down both of them. He told me that he didn‚Äôt expect these protests to die down easily, because so many people had been killed and hurt: every time they have a funeral, the victims friends and family gathers, and the anger flares up again. Same with the 40-day Shia mourning period, after which they meet again and the same thing happens. Later that night there were gunshots and explosions in town, about 1-2 miles from my hotel. My heart breaks for these people. It‚Äôs going to take a lot of bloodshed, but I hope they get the freedoms they so strongly desire, and are willing to die for.

As for the riding, Iran is absolutely huge, and has hugely varied landscapes and I‚Äôve only been to a small part of it. The northwest is a [high plateau dotted with hills](https://i.imgur.com/3OJLulW.jpg), mountains to the west in Turkey, and with a large salt lake next to Urmia. Due to climate change the once enormous lake is now little more than a huge salt flat with some wet spots. Towards the south are beautiful hills and [mountain ranges](https://i.imgur.com/fGBXEDB.jpg), canyons, dry riverbeds, and occasional agriculture. As I went further south the landscape slowly became flatter, with [large-scale agriculture](https://i.imgur.com/THOqFYN.jpg) and huge irrigation projects around. Even further south around the Persian Gulf it becomes a proper desert, scorching hot during the day, cool in the nights. [Giant oil refineries](https://i.imgur.com/Iz1asQP.jpg) tower over enormous featureless deserts, long roads with barely any traffic going seemingly nowhere, vanishing into the horizon. [Infrastructure is generally good](https://i.imgur.com/Pu80g7Y.jpg), roads are decent and there‚Äôs even AAA around, trucks with towing equipment providing roadside assistance (indicative of a fairly sophisticated society, in my book). Gas is only about 5 cents a liter, and every time you stop people want to make conversation, you‚Äôre offered tea, baclava, snacks, people want to take pictures with you ‚Äì but at the same time it maintains a certain kind of innocence. There aren‚Äôt a whole lot of tourists in Iran outside the main cities, and I had several people including gas station attendants come up to me shyly, asking in their best English where I was from, what I thought of their country, and if they could please take a photo with me? It was almost endearing at times. Gave me goosebumps, especially considering the international isolation, economic problems, and murderous dictatorship bullshit these people are going through. Not a single time did I feel unsafe, even the more serious looking Basiji/Revolutionary Guard checkpoints were generally courteous and speedy. One thing I‚Äôd like to add here is how forward-thinking the hospitality of many of these people was. From Turkey to Qatar all the way to Israel I got offered more than a dozen phone numbers, with the following reasoning: ‚ÄúHere, take my number. If you‚Äôre ever in front of someone who doesn‚Äôt speak English, call me, give them the phone, and I will translate for you‚Äù. 

In Khorramabad I got spooked a bit, and decided not to stretch my luck and go straight to the Iraqi border and on to Kuwait the next day. Getting out of Iran was easy, but getting into Iraq ended up a crazy struggle with bureaucracy. [I recorded the story later that night](https://soundcloud.com/user909842478/bureaucracy-and-humanity/s-mH9rQ1jaxe2?si=d926794ac5d9418c8fe6d9eb8c8c6d13) in my hotel in Kuwait. It‚Äôs a bit of a long sit at 30 minutes, but if you want to hear a crazy tale of foreign border crossings it might be worth it.

From the audio story: [this is what the Kuwaiti highway 80 looked like](https://i.imgur.com/xtWWEXn.jpg) after the chaotic Iraqi withdrawal during the Gulf War, during which their columns got annihilated by the USAF.

**Part 3: Kuwait to Jordan**

*You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name / It felt good to be out of the rain (America, 1971)*

From Kuwait I went on through Saudi Arabia (KSA), to Bahrain and Qatar. Kuwait city wasn‚Äôt very appealing, the city is huge and nobody walks, everyone drives their giant fucking cars everywhere, even though gas isn‚Äôt particularly cheap at about 50 cents a liter. I spent some time around the [water front](https://i.imgur.com/OLqGMW0.jpg) and in the old markets, but [walking around the city](https://i.imgur.com/s74j5ty.jpg) was a PITA because [everything is designed around cars and cars only](https://i.imgur.com/ZCMt7qU.jpg), they really took the wrong lessons from the Americans that stayed after the war. There are some monuments and minor other interesting buildings around, but apart from that it feels like the business district of any other major city. [At least their money is very pretty](https://i.imgur.com/MujG89H.jpg). Two things happened in Kuwait that I want to describe in a little more detail.

When I pulled up to my hotel (City Tower Kuwait, at 80$ a night one of the cheapest hotels in town) a short man with a little black-and-white hat greets me enthusiastically, and gestures where he'd like me to park. Despite my best attempts to dissuade him he insists on carrying my bags to the elevator after I've checked in, and explains that I can use the wheelchair ramp to park the motorcycle right next to the entrance where the reception can keep an eye on it twenty-four-seven. Later, after I've showered the desert sand out of my hair I come across him taking note of the cars parked in front of the hotel in a little booklet. He's impressed with the motorcycle and brings me tea while I sit down to clean and grease the chain. His name is Bahad from Nepal, and he has been in Kuwait for five years now, working for the same hotel all that time. First as room service and cleaner, now as parking attendant and customer representative. The entire country runs on immigrant labor: native Kuwaiti people receive a handsome stipend from the government simply for existing, and as a result they tend not to do any labor. They own most of the businesses though, while people like Bahad do the actual work.

The next morning I went to the Yamaha dealership for an oil change. The service representative initially refuses because my bike is a Triumph and not a Yamaha, but since I got the new filter with me and oil is, well, oil, I convince him to call his boss for me. Essa, a Kuwaiti, raises his eyebrows after seeing my license plate, then shakes my hand warmly and assures me that everything will be alright. His mechanics will take good care of my bike he promises, and asks if I would prefer tea, coffee, or an iced beverage while I wait. I watch as the Indian mechanics roll the bike into the shop, and after receiving a mug of fresh coffee from the garage's bartender I follow them inside. The fully blind shop cat is purring away in the corner, while several machines are being worked on. A Yamaha racer stands gutted on one of the lifts, its engine being revised on the table next to it. Two workers are busy installing floodlights onto a shiny new dune buggy. After the [oil change](https://i.imgur.com/1btpfgH.jpg) the Indian crew checks the tire pressure and fluids, then gives the bike a [thorough wash](https://i.imgur.com/WWMdtV1.jpg) outside in the courtyard, while I stroll around the showroom admiring all the latest motorcycles, generators, and golf carts that Yamaha has to offer. When it's finally time to leave I ask Essa if they accept VISA cards. ""No"", he says. ""There's nothing to pay, this is a gift"".

That night I meet Bahad again in the lobby. It's quiet, and he has time to chat. I ask him about his life in Nepal and his work here in Kuwait city, and he indulges my naivety with extreme politeness. He works five 10-hour shifts a week for 140 Kuwaiti Dinar or about 500 dollars a month. The hotel provides lodging and clothes, and the employees are allowed to take home any leftovers from the daily breakfast buffet. He much prefers the clean hotel environment over construction work, even though the latter pays better. Every day before heading to his little apartment he fills a jerrycan with drinking water from the giant filter in the hotel basement, greatly reducing his living expenses. He sends home most of his salary and the tips he receives. He's not married, but the money provides for his widowed sister and her three children. Nearly 5000 dollars in the past year he explains, beaming with pride.

Crossing from [Kuwait into KSA](https://i.imgur.com/dOQjqOo.jpg) was easy, Kuwait uses the Carnet but KSA has their own vehicle registration system. It took them a few minutes to correctly register my plate as the system kept trying to input it right-to-left the Arabic way, but overall it didn‚Äôt take long. I had my visa pre-arranged, the conditions of which were pretty awesome (140 dollars for a 12-month multiple entry visa including health insurance), and every KSA crossing I did had at least one person who spoke more than a bit of English. I got a lot of interested looks at these border posts, people wanting to take pictures, handing me water, and snacks. They only know my country as ‚ÄòHulanda‚Äô in Arabic, so I often had to explain what the NL on my plate stood for.

Bahrain is a fascinating place, a little island nation connected to KSA through a long causeway built in the 80‚Äôies by Dutch company Ballast Nedam. Bahrain discovered long ago that oil revenues don‚Äôt last forever, and they started attracting business and tourists with a huge financial sector, giant malls, and the GP of course. Saudis refer to it as the Las Vegas of the Middle East. Despite it being essentially a Muslim Emirate there‚Äôs pork, [alcohol](https://i.imgur.com/EelXbrB.jpg), night clubs, [weird souvenirs](https://i.imgur.com/ajdZhPY.jpg), and even prostitution. KSA prohibits most of these things, and as a result Bahrain is filled to the brim with Saudi tourists coming over for a few days to have their fill, then heading off into piety again. It appears that KSA has significant control over the Bahraini government, and both are mostly happy with the arrangement. Riyadh knows that it‚Äôs impossible to completely forbid these things, and they much prefer having them in a controlled environment just off the coast, behind a border, so they can keep up the pretense of purity for their own country.

As a result of all this tourism the KSA-Bahraini border is extremely efficient and speedy. It‚Äôs essentially a stop along the highway, which by definition means there‚Äôs no space or time for extended controls or they‚Äôll just cause a massive traffic jam. Visa is on arrival, 5 bucks, and you can even pay by card lmao. The bike was a little more work, I had to walk into the customs office to get the Carnet stamped. An older officer pointed me to a desk with a very young girl in uniform behind it, she had never seen a Carnet before so me and the old guy talked her through it. Both spoke decent English and were very friendly, and I got the usual offerings of tea and bottled water.

The capital Manama is a strange place, it was murderously hot so walking around town I was ducking into air conditioned bus stops (!) and coffee shops to cool down. Everything is expensive but not terribly so, and at the same time there‚Äôs the same business-district-blandness to most of it. Except for the old town with numerous shops and markets, delicious food from all over the world, and lots of life in the street. I talked to some of the migrant workers in the restaurants and one of them told me loads of Saudis come to Manama to get wasted, then wreck their car drunk driving, but they just scrap it and buy a new one in Damman before heading back home. The scenes on the streets were more varied than in KSA or Kuwait, lots of families from different backgrounds. It was interesting to see that even Saudi men, wearing their Thawb, the formal white robe, have girlfriends or wives, and children that they show affection for when their environment allows for it. My stupid Western brain never really considered this. Dress for women ranged from all-covered for the pious Muslims to not covered at all for most tourists and migrant workers, and everything in between.

From Bahrain I rode back through KSA [to Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/mdd6v9A.jpg). Too early for and not much to do with the World Cup, I just wanted to [see](https://i.imgur.com/fUFFTWi.jpg) the [place](https://i.imgur.com/GpPzMTU.jpg) I guess. It‚Äôs only a hundred miles as the crow flies from Manama to Doha, but there‚Äôs a huge bay in-between which means it took all day. KSA borders were friendly and efficient as before, but the Qatari customs messed with my Carnet, tore out an entire page and refused to elaborate. I took some pictures and a video and contacted ADAC that evening but they said it should be OK. The customs guys got really upset when while filming the Carnet, I lifted the camera up, and demanded I delete the footage. But they didn‚Äôt make me empty the recycle bin lol.

[Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/ZPAT8Yv.jpg) is largely similar to Kuwait, one single big city with not much around, cars everywhere. The Qataris themselves are rich, and [migrants do all the work](https://i.imgur.com/vhTtUtR.jpg). You‚Äôve seen the stories surrounding the world cup no doubt. Doha was also scorching hot, but thankfully a bit easier to walk around than Kuwait City. One month before the WC started there was construction going on everywhere, day and night. The stadiums were pretty much finished but they were still building hotels, walkways, parks, and god knows what else. I talked to some of the Indian workers and they confirmed pretty much everything the news has been saying about Qatar, but they also said they weren‚Äôt entirely unhappy with the situation. They make good money to send home, they get lots of breaks during the hottest parts of the day, and food and lodging is taken care of, depending on which company they work for. It‚Äôs hard work for (looking from the West) meagre pay, but they come here because it‚Äôs much better than what they‚Äôd get back home. Doha again is a pretty bland city, the [old Souk Waaqif](https://i.imgur.com/q0Nw7Bh.jpg) is interesting to walk around with loads of [little shops and craftsmen](https://i.imgur.com/Xrt822d.jpg), but it‚Äôs also extremely touristic and expensive. The best place to me was the [Museum of Islamic Art](https://i.imgur.com/dSQEo2D.jpg), which had a lot of fascinating artefacts and stories from [all over the Middle East](https://i.imgur.com/J7lt9mY.jpg). In Qatar I also came across a [Saudi football fan](https://i.imgur.com/wW7dUSX.jpg) who had been hiking through the desert for months to make it to Doha for the world cup. Even the police wanted to [take pictures with him](https://i.imgur.com/RLLIZkq.jpg).

Now by the time I was in Doha I had started thinking of my return leg. I got some worrying messages that Ethiopia had pretty much closed its borders to foreign motor vehicles, demanding tens of thousands of dollars as collateral at the border. I had really wanted to go to Egypt, but that also was quite expensive to arrange, and then I‚Äôd have the problem of getting the bike out. Transport by air is crazy expensive (5000 to 7000 dollars, plus needs to be drained of all fluids), so I decided to dig into my contact list for an alternative option. Someone had suggested to me some time ago that it‚Äôs possible to ship vehicles from Israel to Greece on a RORO transport (meaning vehicles only, no passengers), which is far cheaper than flying. So I got in touch with Rosenfeld Shipping in Haifa, who informed me they had a weekly service to Lavrion in Greece, which for a motorcycle would only be about 700 dollars. That seemed mighty fine to me, so off towards Haifa I went. 

From Doha to the Jordan border is nearly 2000km, [straight through the desert](https://i.imgur.com/hpJa4s5.jpg). It took me [three day](https://i.imgur.com/RoEBXYc.jpg)s, first to Riyadh, then Hail, and lastly Qurayyat. I was carrying about [3L of water and some food](https://i.imgur.com/3JLBE59.jpg), and even though I was drinking a lot in the desert I never got in trouble in KSA, there‚Äôs always a bit of traffic around and it‚Äôs easy to stock up at gas stations. Although it was a similar [desert](https://i.imgur.com/3cbkMeb.jpg) to Western Sahara it felt much more [‚Äòcivilized‚Äô](https://i.imgur.com/mawQYXp.jpg) because of this. I really wish I could‚Äôve [stayed a bit longer](https://i.imgur.com/bTdC9W9.jpg) in KSA because it‚Äôs a fascinating place. Politically and religiously it‚Äôs obviously a disgusting mess, but the landscapes are spectacular, the people are almost crazy friendly, and riding through the desert for so long really is a boring yet also fascinating experience. [Hours upon hours of nothingness](https://i.imgur.com/7FzOtxN.jpg), even [gas stations](https://i.imgur.com/aB9sisb.jpg) are rare, with sometimes 200+ km between them. There is occasional traffic, and the truck drivers honk and wave back. Giant power lines follow the roads and camels are everywhere. Concrete husks of old gas stations, guard posts and other things are occasionally seen on the side of the road. But above all there is sand, silence, and asphalt. I got lucky with the weather. It was hot but not outrageously so, around 30 degrees during the day, and I even caught a speck of rain around Hail. Also a sandstorm just west of Riyadh which was surreal, everything around you dark yellow and brown, the road below and the sky above covered in streams of sand and dust.

People in the street [looked at me with great interest](https://i.imgur.com/MWKPNDb.jpg) and wanted to talk a lot. In Hail I met a group of Saudi and Chinese visitors who worked in some manufacturing industry who fawned over the bike and wanted to know all about my trip. I ran out of Saudi Riyals in Qurayyat on Thursday evening, and walked into town trying to find a place to get something to eat. On the way a Saudi driver hailed me, guy in a big Pajero, traditional dress. He asked if I was a tourist (yes), and how I was enjoying KSA so far (fine). He asked if I needed anything? So I said well, I need to change some euro‚Äôs for Riyals, about 50 euro‚Äôs worth? He got out his phone and worked out that would be about 175 Riyals. So he took out his wallet and handed me 350 Riyals in exchange for my 50 euros. I tried to convince him otherwise but he wasn‚Äôt having it, so he literally just gave me 50 euro‚Äôs for nothing. He just wanted me to have a good time and be able to buy food and pay for the fees at the border the next day. The hospitality of some of these people truly boggles the mind.

The border with Jordan was rather easy, if expensive. One Jordanian Dinar is about 1 euro 50, and it cost a small fortune to cross: visa (40JD), motorcycle (20JD), motorcycle insurance (36JD), SIM card (14JD). In Jordan I went down the length of the country towards Wadi Rum that same day, on highway 5 through the (Jordanian) Eastern Desert. Like KSA this part of the country was extremely sparsely populated, but at one point I randomly came across two dozen bikes parked on the side of the road and a bunch of guys having lunch. Turned out to be the Amman Motorcycle Club on their weekly tour. They even had a follow car with fuel, water, and a trailer for emergencies. As soon as I stopped I was swarmed by these [jovial guys](https://i.imgur.com/SnYUgpX.jpg) and they immediately handed me some water and snickers bars. We spent some time chatting and eating before going our separate ways. 

Jordan is the second recommendation I'd like to make. The country is small, the parts worth visiting are relatively close together. [Wadi Rum](https://i.imgur.com/CXC89O9.jpg) and [Petra](https://i.imgur.com/Rg4TVlj.jpg) have long been famous and they are worth every second and every penny. It is truly a wonderful, elating feeling to [ride around the desert](https://i.imgur.com/LDDIM4b.jpg) [between the colossal red mesa-like rocks](https://i.imgur.com/aVKe8Tg.jpg) in all sorts of fascinating shapes at Wadi Rum. Petra instead is human made, ‚Äòthe rose-colored city half as old as time itself‚Äô. Already famous in Roman times its location was ‚Äòlost‚Äô for a bit until being rediscovered last century. An entire city worth of buildings, caves, dwellings, [temples](https://i.imgur.com/feeWyot.jpg) carved out of red sandstone, with a fascinating water management system and a huge amphitheater to top it off. From Petra on I rode north following the Dead Sea. The roads across the central Jordanian mountain range were very pretty and [very quiet](https://i.imgur.com/kTLeOqz.jpg). Further north there were lots of kitschy shops selling Dead Sea sand, mud, face masks, all that jazz. Closer to Amman there suddenly was a lot of traffic, and the city itself is massive and sprawling, there‚Äôs not a lot of high rise so with 4 million people it covers a mind-boggling area. I spent a few days there and around Jerash. Amman has loads of interesting sights as well as a pretty decent street and night life, I went to see the Jordan Museum which had some really nice exhibitions and [historical artifacts](https://i.imgur.com/27s8IrM.jpg), the original [Hejaz railway station](https://i.imgur.com/Xpp4EFK.jpg), as well as the Citadel which offers great views of the city center. Jerash has a huge archaeological park with a well preserved [Roman street](https://i.imgur.com/31LjZHW.jpg), and the surrounding hills are dotted with villages and olive orchards. Riding around this part of Jordan isn‚Äôt super interesting in an of itself, it was fairly wet and cold while I was there and the roads are super busy.",1,1757700048.0,Triumph,2,1.0,False

**Serenade Aux Fraises** - Strawberry, passionfruit, plum, Moroccan rose, cream, Tahitian Vanilla, organic sandalwood, violet leaf, musk, and black agar

Tart, sweet, but with some complexity! Dries down very soft and sweet. The strawberry is a bit synthetic but I don't really mind, it's not that syrupy/cloying/cough syrupy sweetness that comes with other synthetic fruit scents. 9/10

**Delizia di Marshmallow** - Marshmallow, vanilla, sugar

Does what it says on the tin. SO sweet. Like sticking your head in a bag of marshmallows, as everyone says. Crazy staying power, but it's also one of my only EDPs so that might be part of it. Ultimately not my thing - much prefer Poesie's marshmallow note. 5/10

**Gateau de Carnaval** - Funnel cake, vanilla latte, toasted brown sugar, and apricot

Toasty apricot and vanilla notes come through, lovely but not blowing my socks off. 6/10

---

**POESIE**

**Villa Diodati**- Rosemary, balsam pine, lakewater, vanilla

I straight up gave this a 2/10 at first. With rest time it's become the ultimate zero to hero - a soft, complex, dark, herby vanilla. 10/10

**Sleepy Ghost** - Marshmallow, lavender

Love this one. Soft and sweet, not a lot of throw but great for bedtime. Planning to FS. 10/10
(companion note - library ghost, similarly soft and sweet but with more of a woody, inky vibe, 8.5/10)

**Madar** - Basmati rice pudding, orange flower water, saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, dried rose petals, sugared pistachios

Turns out I'm a fan of soft and sweet. This one is very much warm spiced rice pudding - not too sweet, not too spicy. Great alternative fall scent if you're not in the mood for pumpkin and apple. 9/10
(companion note - I mentally class this in with Amaterasu, which is another warm spiced rice blend but with a bit more incense and less sweetness, 7.5/10)

**OYSTER!** - Grey musk, ocean brine, bitter cucumber, lemon, elemi resin, angelica

I hate this. This is my most hated scent. Detested it when I first smelled, still can't stand it after rest time. So musky and bitter and briny in the worst ways with no redeeming qualities. Some folks LOVE this one so it's a good guidepost to see if our tastes align -100/10

**Tiny Phantom** - Pink rose, marshmallow buttercream, white musk, mahogany

Grandma florals. Sweet in a cloying, dusty old flowery way. Not a fan. 1/10

---

**HAUS OF GLOI**

**Vice** - Coffee, marshmallow, graham cracker, hazelnuts, black chocolate

Exactly what's advertised - a nutty coffee, chocolate, graham cracker blend. Excellently balanced and especially nice if you're into cocoa/coffee scents (I really like this one but I wouldn't say it's a signature-level scent for me). 7/10

**Elderflower Lemonade** - Lemon, elderflower

LOVE this one. Bright, tart lemon that dries down to a soft, sweet floral with a bit of lingering tartness. Excellent spring/summer scent. 9.5/10

**Cozy Sweater** - Skin musk, faded perfume, Egyptian amber, nag champa incense, aged vanilla

Like the sweater in question was worn by a grandma who liked to wear old perfume and then was stored in an attic for 20 years. I know this one is pretty beloved but I have to give it a 3/10.

**Litchi Milk Tea** - Lychee fruit, black tea, coconut milk

Like if someone was able to make soap out of the essence of play-doh. Immediate scrubber. 0/10

---

**NUI COBALT**

**Grey Cat** - Dry smoked vanilla, fluffy marshmallow creme, fresh blueberries, lavender, Earl Grey.

First one I got full-size. Super realistic blueberries, tart bergamot, soft background notes of lavender, dries down with a general soft floral/vanilla sweetness with unique blueberry notes. 10/10

**Pisces** - Honeydew melon, garden mint, fresh basil, cucumber, elderflower, lemon myrtle, ylang.

Didn't really like this one at first, gave it a 6/10. After some rest time it's delightfully fruity and bright, excellent summer scent (but I was a cucumber melon bitch growing up so no surprise that I love these notes). 8/10",1,1757700007.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

*This is a composition of different bits I've written in the past few years, I've put them all together and added pictures*

Three years ago in August 2022 I departed home in the Netherlands for a tour of the Middle East. I covered 22.000km in about four months, through desert and snow, across 22 countries, 15 of which were new to me. I met a large number of amazingly curious and kind people, had one of the worst days of my life struggling with Iraqi bureaucracy, and saw some of the most gorgeous landscapes this planet has to offer. [The Tiger did well](https://i.imgur.com/jTQelSl.jpg), with no problems whatsoever. It had a major service earlier this year, with a new chain and tires (Metzeler Karoo Street) at the start of this trip. I did two oil changes while on the road and that was it basically. I was carrying an assortment of tools and spare parts just in case, but I didn‚Äôt need any of it. Perhaps the [lucky charm](https://i.imgur.com/mck3csu.jpg) that one of my former coworkers knitted for me helped :)

Please forgive me for the meagre amount of photographs. It‚Äôs never been my strong suit, traveling alone I just don‚Äôt stop nearly often enough to take pictures.

**Part 1: Netherlands to Naples**

*All of it was made for you and me / 'Cause it just belongs to you and me / So let's take a ride and see what's mine (Iggy Pop, 1977)*

I left home in August, riding down through Germany to Switzerland and [into](https://i.imgur.com/gXiAYo0.jpg) the [alps](https://i.imgur.com/KUAp03S.jpg). I wanted to do a few hikes around the [ski resorts](https://i.imgur.com/HSX5Mjl.jpg) that I normally only see in winter, and take some of the passes that I hadn‚Äôt so far, notably the [Col Maddelena](https://i.imgur.com/yC8wolo.jpg) and the [Col de la Bonnette](https://i.imgur.com/LAQQeq0.jpg). Also came across the town of Roubion [perched high on a hilltop](https://i.imgur.com/GT8qmDr.jpg). I spent a few days in [Milan](https://i.imgur.com/0l90qMS.jpg) chilling with friends, then headed back up into the Alps to go around the usual suspects, and some of my favorite passes: Albula, Stelvio, and Bernina. East through Austria on the Silvretta, then south through the Brenner, taking the local road this time instead of the motorway, and then south-east by Cortina d‚ÄôAmpezzo towards Venice. I‚Äôd never been to the canal city before, and I was surprised at the size of it. I had imagined something smaller, more bunched up, but it was far larger and more typically Italian than I‚Äôd thought. Dirty abandoned alleys alongside romantic canal side restaurants, beggars and dogs alongside tourists from pretty much all over the world. A nice experience, but not nearly as spectacular as I was made to believe. 

From there on I headed east to visit friends in Hungary, and I got absolutely soaked the last few hours towards Balaton. It was a warm kind of rainstorm thankfully, so not terribly uncomfortable. We spent two days [hiking](https://i.imgur.com/qCJkCHt.jpg) and [sailing](https://i.imgur.com/MvRg7xd.jpg) around Balaton, before I took off again back towards Venice, stopping around Trieste, [Rimini](https://i.imgur.com/oHexagp.jpg), Florence, and [Pisa](https://i.imgur.com/AdDgEG5.jpg), from where I took the [ferry to Corsica](https://i.imgur.com/CmQHNn6.jpg). Northern Italy is quite flat and boring at times, but between San Marino and Florence there are some gorgeous low mountain passes through thick forests and quiet little villages.

Corsica is my first real recommendation to anyone reading this. It‚Äôs French, but don‚Äôt say that too loud, the Corsicans are fiercely independent and [anti-French graffiti](https://i.imgur.com/pfAAgBP.jpg) and posters are everywhere. The island is basically a [mountain range](https://i.imgur.com/x7eQzMW.jpg) [rising from the sea](https://i.imgur.com/L69tTh4.jpg), with [scarcely a straight road around](https://i.imgur.com/qKSOZ4z.jpg). The [coast](https://i.imgur.com/B4Z4bbA.jpg) is mostly [rocky hills](https://i.imgur.com/R8c9oyw.jpg), with innumerable bridges, tunnels, and little seaside villages. [Inland](https://i.imgur.com/EnnXBCu.jpg) is [a bit greener](https://i.imgur.com/yXdebSo.jpg), with scavenging [pigs](https://i.imgur.com/AcAgMEa.jpg) all [around](https://i.imgur.com/zjlHfea.jpg) and sweet hiking trails and a few beautiful [mountain passes](https://i.imgur.com/wHlmsU9.jpg). It's moderately priced too, with affordable BnB‚Äôs and hostels dotted around the cities, campsites throughout the interior, and a tasty twist on French Mediterranean cuisine. It‚Äôs quite small too, and easy to get around despite the curvy madness that is the roads. Whether you like riding, hiking, cycling or simply cruising around taking in the atmosphere, you can‚Äôt really go wrong with Corsica.

From Bonifacio in the south I took the [ferry to Sardegna](https://i.imgur.com/HRfdY39.jpg), which is much larger than Corsica, very Italian, but also culturally distinct from the mainland. The [landscapes](https://i.imgur.com/Jp04Ofd.jpg) are a [bit more varied](https://i.imgur.com/YktQv4u.jpg), with [gorgeous coastlines in the west](https://i.imgur.com/7Z9WMXT.jpg), mountains in the east, and agricultural land and some larger cities in-between. There‚Äôs more to see than just nature though: fascinating megalithic ruins known as the [Nuraghi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuraghe) dot the landscape. Considered ancient ruins already in Roman times, they may have been fortress, house, storage room or temple, their exact purpose remains unknown but there are thousands of them in varying sizes and states of repair all over the island. I found one close to Cagliari that offered a gorgeous view of the city and the harbor. Around Sassari I did a day-long guided [horseback tour](https://i.imgur.com/AroGPqY.jpg). Not having brought my equipment I had to ride in my shorts which seemed like a terrible idea at first, but in the end it didn‚Äôt bother me much. We had an awesome time, riding through farmland across old gravel roads, by ancient churches, and murky pools full of giant tadpoles and salamanders.

In Cagliari I took the ferry to Palermo; a few hours before boarding I came across a French couple in the harbor on a large KTM adventure bike which had battery problems. Together with the Italian AAA we managed to get the bike [loaded on a trailer](https://i.imgur.com/00YtXLc.jpg) and brought to the ship in time for our sailing. The 12 hour boat ride offered a [gorgeous sunset](https://i.imgur.com/NcjTM9L.jpg) and subsequent sunrise again not long after. Once in Palermo the next morning we pushed their bike out the boat to the port where another AAA vehicle was waiting to take it to a garage. 

Now Sicily I was not too impressed with. Palermo and Syracuse are decent enough cities with interesting sights, and here are some exceptional monuments around such as the [Valley of the Temples](https://i.imgur.com/iClcJc0.jpg), [Taormina](https://i.imgur.com/xWKC7MM.jpg), [Siracusa](https://i.imgur.com/UrjsPSJ.jpg), and Piazza Armeria, but in between these highlights the island is poor and filthy. Infrastructure is in an abysmal state, the city peripheries are filthy and stifled with traffic, and lodging and food in the touristy areas is pretty expensive. Giant piles of garbage, plastic, and whatnot are everywhere, as are derelict buildings and abandoned farms and industry. I had a good time, especially the mosaics at Piazza Armeria are [absolutely stunning](https://i.imgur.com/2WryKNl.jpg), and climbing Etna was a unique experience but the entire island gave me a strong feeling of ‚Äòlost potential‚Äô. With just a little more effort and investment it could be an absolutely great destination, but we all know why that isn‚Äôt happening.

From Sicily I took yet another ferry back to the Italian mainland, and slalomed through the [nose of the boot](https://i.imgur.com/JTNc1LU.jpg) towards Naples. [Calabria](https://i.imgur.com/4i4MoAK.jpg) is known for being under Mafia control to a huge degree, perhaps more so than Sicily. It‚Äôs a bit cleaner as well, and features many [pretty mountaintop towns](https://i.imgur.com/2htIGcH.jpg), even the odd ski resort, and [huge forested hill ranges](https://i.imgur.com/KNE7kNc.jpg). Not [an area of Italy](https://i.imgur.com/kFq99cO.jpg) [I was very familiar with](https://i.imgur.com/ZGw6C5A.jpg), it‚Äôs definitely on my list to go back to one day. In Naples I had an appointment with the local Triumph dealer for some maintenance and storage, as I had to fly home for a few days to attend a wedding.

**Part 2: Naples to Kuwait**

*Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command / Your old road is rapidly agin' (Bob Dylan, 1964)*

While all of the above was happening, trouble broke out in Iran. I had my VISA pre-arranged for pickup in Ankara, but not wanting to wait for things to get out of control I decided to make my way there ASAP. The initial plan had been to spend 2-3 weeks going around Greece and Turkey, but that can wait for another time. From Naples again through southern Italy to Bari and Brindisi, and then the [ferry to Igoumenitsa](https://i.imgur.com/hi51lge.jpg) in Greece. Straight shot through Greece to Thessaloniki in the pouring rain, and then into Turkey to Gallipoli. The border was an interesting experience, it‚Äôs basically a long, low bridge with guardhouses every few meters. Border formalities themselves were peanuts, but the sight on the bridge was interesting. The Turks and Greeks have a troubling history, and the guardhouses on each side were manned in full, young lads on the Greek side in full tacticool looking like something out of Call of Duty, whereas the Turks were dressed more like WW1 soldiers, old brown ragged uniforms. As you enter Turkey the differences grow steadily. Donkey carts and ancient tractors on the motor way, but also flashy modern cars. Expensive toll roads and [gas stations with WIFI](https://i.imgur.com/RtFAGhG.jpg), but also tiny villages with what can best be described as huts with sat TV dishes and rusty bicycles.

In Gallipoli harbor with a great view of the absolutely [enormous bridge across the Dardanelles](https://i.imgur.com/uVp4pi6.jpg) I came across a statue of Piri Reis, one of the first scholars to draw up detailed maps of the Mediterranean. I also got to chat with a shopkeeper and one of his sons, who were extremely critical of Erdogan and his ridiculous social and economic policies. The old man proudly showed me the app he had been using to learn English, and he didn‚Äôt mince words. Erdogan is a wannabe dictator, who‚Äôs using religion to control his people. And everywhere you go it‚Äôs there, even the tiniest 10-house village will have a shiny mosque, most likely built quite recently and subsidized by the government. Prayer call is everywhere, but the people in the cities are fed up with it. One of his sons was going off to Ankara to study civil engineering and he was already eyeing a job in Germany. According to them, the younger population is fed up with the conservative bullshit and dictatorial tendencies of the Erdogan and his cronies. They feel powerless however since he has strong support among the clergy and in the rural areas, so when they can they simply leave. 

In Ankara I went to the Iranian embassy to pick up my visa, and everything there was working as usual. Pictures of Khamenei (the religious dictator) and Soleimani (the general assassinated at Baghdad airport by the CIA in January 2020) were all over the waiting room. As the visa had already been granted online there were no questions, just some waiting, payment (75 euros), and pickup. 

From Ankara I went south, through Adana, Gaziantep, [Mardin](https://i.imgur.com/pYlwdrE.jpg) and eventually Yuksekova near the [Iranian border](https://i.imgur.com/UtUcxpu.jpg). The highland around Ankara was cold and windy, the canyon down towards the coast was absolutely gorgeous. Orange trees and olive plantations were everywhere, little farming villages with people working the land and collecting fruits in the orchards. I felt like I had gone 50 years back in time. Heading east the landscape slowly turned desert, the border with first Syria and later Iraq reminding me of Berlin, with giant walls, guard posts, and large swathes of barbed-wire no-mans-land. Everywhere I went and stayed the people were extremely friendly, not all of them spoke English but with google translate as assistance we had many conversations. They echoed the same sentiments as the people in Gallipoli, then again I stayed mostly in the cities. With the collapse of the Turkish Lira (due to Erdogan being an idiot) everything was crazy cheap, and of course Turkish food has a reputation already, so I had a great and affordable time. South-Eastern Turkey between Cizre and [Yuksekova](https://i.imgur.com/QRQiafZ.jpg) felt [desolate, but in a good way](https://i.imgur.com/S3Z32hX.jpg). There‚Äôs hardly any traffic, the road winds round and round the cliffs and gorges that form the border with Iraq. The landscape is beautiful brown/green (copper?) rocks with oases around the places where water collects. There‚Äôs occasional [military base](https://i.imgur.com/3WNzAN1.jpg)s and [checkpoints](https://i.imgur.com/D4umJkf.jpg) on the hilltops and around the passes, but these soldiers were mostly bored and quite surprised to see a traveler come by. I got offered tea a lot, and they wanted to talk about football and other worldly affairs.

The [border with Iran](https://i.imgur.com/kCPGxY4.jpg) was surprisingly easy. No sign of increased security or anything. I got to use the Carnet (import/export document for vehicles) for the first time, which was interesting. Thankfully the customs officer knew exactly what to do with it so the entire crossing was barely a 30-minute affair. Once in Iran I rode into Urmia to try and find a place to change some money, but it was a Friday, the Muslim rest day, so I was SOL since everything was closed. In one of the shopping centers I approached a group of young-ish guys (20-somethings?) and asked if they could help me out, and lo and behold after a short google-translate mediated conversation they arranged for about 50 euro‚Äôs worth of Iranian Rials. Their currency is hilariously worthless, so it came down to about 25 million Rials, a stack [the size of the LOTR single-volume](https://i.imgur.com/KVhMqj7.jpg). 

Everywhere I went in Iran people warned me not to go to the big cities: Tabriz, Tehran et cetera were considered extremely dangerous, as the regime had resorted to outright shooting at the protesters by now. I ended up staying only 4 days in Iran which was a bloody shame, I basically followed the Iraqi border south towards Khorramshahr and then crossed into Iraq. Part of this was Iranian Kurdistan which has historically not been as closely aligned to Tehran (or Baghdad, or Istanbul for that matter) as the rest of the country. Out of dozens upon dozens of encounters with [hotel employees](https://i.imgur.com/QzgkAon.jpg), shopkeepers, [students](https://i.imgur.com/RgUXO8h.jpg), even law enforcement, they all said the same thing more or less. They all want justice for Amini and the countless other killed or hurt by the regime, a lifting of the idiotic religious laws, and more freedoms and opportunities, especially the younger generation. One of the students installed a special VPN on my phone which allowed me to connect to the internet through his mobile hotspot, and at various restaurants and [hotels](https://i.imgur.com/i711CcP.jpg) through WIFI. Even then, the internet often went down for hours at a time. I also came across a rare sight, an [Iranian Suzuki GSXR](https://i.imgur.com/Pkgw21B.jpg), a pretty decent racer. No plates, no helmet, no problem.

[Walking around town](https://i.imgur.com/j7VMd6w.jpg), or just [sitting in a restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/ZYvpUSU.jpg) I got latched on to by groups of younger people wanting to hear about the world and share their story. They feel trapped in their country by the regime, which is plundering the economy and enriching itself at the cost of the population. They don‚Äôt give a shit about Russia, Israel, or the USA, and many are quite moderate when it comes to religion. There weren‚Äôt nearly as many mosques around as in Turkey, and most of the students weren‚Äôt openly religious at all. It was shocking how eager they were to talk about these highly sensitive topics. It gave me a huge blocking feeling of helplessness, hearing these people lament their dictators, wishing, hoping, for a better future where they‚Äôd have a free life, work, be able to travel, be in touch with the world. Keep in mind though this was only in one particular area of the country, the west/northwest along the border with Iraq. I don‚Äôt know if this is representative for the population as a whole. The famous Arab hospitality is all around in Iran as well, multiple times in restaurants other guests stood up and wanted to pay for me, other times people bought me snacks and drinks just for talking to them for a while. I usually tried to accept gracefully and then sneak in payment any way.

In Sanandaj I asked my hotel if it was safe to walk into town to find a restaurant and the lady answered (in fluent English!) that it most certainly wasn‚Äôt, but she could call me a taxi and instruct him to take me by some restaurants? Which I happily agreed to. We drove around town for about two hours, conversing through google translate again. He showed me some monuments, and places were protests had escalated recently, burned out armored vehicles and cars lined the road. Around the main square there were 100+ police and soldiers with big guns (APCs and such) standing around, the giant roundabout next to them full of cars, honking incessantly as a provocation. Some of the drivers even yelled at the police, it was a frightening scene. We then went to a little restaurant to eat kebabs, and the driver showed me pictures of an older man from his neighborhood, who had been shot the week before during a protest. Some girl had lain injured in the street and the old guy (60, 70?) had ran out to help her and they‚Äôd just gunned down both of them. He told me that he didn‚Äôt expect these protests to die down easily, because so many people had been killed and hurt: every time they have a funeral, the victims friends and family gathers, and the anger flares up again. Same with the 40-day Shia mourning period, after which they meet again and the same thing happens. Later that night there were gunshots and explosions in town, about 1-2 miles from my hotel. My heart breaks for these people. It‚Äôs going to take a lot of bloodshed, but I hope they get the freedoms they so strongly desire, and are willing to die for.

As for the riding, Iran is absolutely huge, and has hugely varied landscapes and I‚Äôve only been to a small part of it. The northwest is a [high plateau dotted with hills](https://i.imgur.com/3OJLulW.jpg), mountains to the west in Turkey, and with a large salt lake next to Urmia. Due to climate change the once enormous lake is now little more than a huge salt flat with some wet spots. Towards the south are beautiful hills and [mountain ranges](https://i.imgur.com/fGBXEDB.jpg), canyons, dry riverbeds, and occasional agriculture. As I went further south the landscape slowly became flatter, with [large-scale agriculture](https://i.imgur.com/THOqFYN.jpg) and huge irrigation projects around. Even further south around the Persian Gulf it becomes a proper desert, scorching hot during the day, cool in the nights. [Giant oil refineries](https://i.imgur.com/Iz1asQP.jpg) tower over enormous featureless deserts, long roads with barely any traffic going seemingly nowhere, vanishing into the horizon. [Infrastructure is generally good](https://i.imgur.com/Pu80g7Y.jpg), roads are decent and there‚Äôs even AAA around, trucks with towing equipment providing roadside assistance (indicative of a fairly sophisticated society, in my book). Gas is only about 5 cents a liter, and every time you stop people want to make conversation, you‚Äôre offered tea, baclava, snacks, people want to take pictures with you ‚Äì but at the same time it maintains a certain kind of innocence. There aren‚Äôt a whole lot of tourists in Iran outside the main cities, and I had several people including gas station attendants come up to me shyly, asking in their best English where I was from, what I thought of their country, and if they could please take a photo with me? It was almost endearing at times. Gave me goosebumps, especially considering the international isolation, economic problems, and murderous dictatorship bullshit these people are going through. Not a single time did I feel unsafe, even the more serious looking Basiji/Revolutionary Guard checkpoints were generally courteous and speedy. One thing I‚Äôd like to add here is how forward-thinking the hospitality of many of these people was. From Turkey to Qatar all the way to Israel I got offered more than a dozen phone numbers, with the following reasoning: ‚ÄúHere, take my number. If you‚Äôre ever in front of someone who doesn‚Äôt speak English, call me, give them the phone, and I will translate for you‚Äù. 

In Khorramabad I got spooked a bit, and decided not to stretch my luck and go straight to the Iraqi border and on to Kuwait the next day. Getting out of Iran was easy, but getting into Iraq ended up a crazy struggle with bureaucracy. [I recorded the story later that night](https://soundcloud.com/user909842478/bureaucracy-and-humanity/s-mH9rQ1jaxe2?si=d926794ac5d9418c8fe6d9eb8c8c6d13) in my hotel in Kuwait. It‚Äôs a bit of a long sit at 30 minutes, but if you want to hear a crazy tale of foreign border crossings it might be worth it.

From the audio story: [this is what the Kuwaiti highway 80 looked like](https://i.imgur.com/xtWWEXn.jpg) after the chaotic Iraqi withdrawal during the Gulf War, during which their columns got annihilated by the USAF. Also, [the Kuwaiti customs officials that helped me so nicely](https://i.imgur.com/9pqvmE5.jpg).



**Part 3: Kuwait to Jordan**

*You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name / It felt good to be out of the rain (America, 1971)*

From Kuwait I went on through Saudi Arabia (KSA), to Bahrain and Qatar. Kuwait city wasn‚Äôt very appealing, the city is huge and nobody walks, everyone drives their giant fucking cars everywhere, even though gas isn‚Äôt particularly cheap at about 50 cents a liter. I spent some time around the [water front](https://i.imgur.com/OLqGMW0.jpg) and in the old markets, but [walking around the city](https://i.imgur.com/s74j5ty.jpg) was a PITA because [everything is designed around cars and cars only](https://i.imgur.com/ZCMt7qU.jpg), they really took the wrong lessons from the Americans that stayed after the war. There are some monuments and minor other interesting buildings around, but apart from that it feels like the business district of any other major city. [At least their money is very pretty](https://i.imgur.com/MujG89H.jpg). Two things happened in Kuwait that I want to describe in a little more detail.

When I pulled up to my hotel (City Tower Kuwait, at 80$ a night one of the cheapest hotels in town) a short man with a little black-and-white hat greets me enthusiastically, and gestures where he'd like me to park. Despite my best attempts to dissuade him he insists on carrying my bags to the elevator after I've checked in, and explains that I can use the wheelchair ramp to park the motorcycle right next to the entrance where the reception can keep an eye on it twenty-four-seven. Later, after I've showered the desert sand out of my hair I come across him taking note of the cars parked in front of the hotel in a little booklet. He's impressed with the motorcycle and brings me tea while I sit down to clean and grease the chain. His name is Bahad from Nepal, and he has been in Kuwait for five years now, working for the same hotel all that time. First as room service and cleaner, now as parking attendant and customer representative. The entire country runs on immigrant labor: native Kuwaiti people receive a handsome stipend from the government simply for existing, and as a result they tend not to do any labor. They own most of the businesses though, while people like Bahad do the actual work.

The next morning I went to the Yamaha dealership for an oil change. The service representative initially refuses because my bike is a Triumph and not a Yamaha, but since I got the new filter with me and oil is, well, oil, I convince him to call his boss for me. Essa, a Kuwaiti, raises his eyebrows after seeing my license plate, then shakes my hand warmly and assures me that everything will be alright. His mechanics will take good care of my bike he promises, and asks if I would prefer tea, coffee, or an iced beverage while I wait. I watch as the Indian mechanics roll the bike into the shop, and after receiving a mug of fresh coffee from the garage's bartender I follow them inside. The fully blind shop cat is purring away in the corner, while several machines are being worked on. A Yamaha racer stands gutted on one of the lifts, its engine being revised on the table next to it. Two workers are busy installing floodlights onto a shiny new dune buggy. After the [oil change](https://i.imgur.com/1btpfgH.jpg) the Indian crew checks the tire pressure and fluids, then gives the bike a [thorough wash](https://i.imgur.com/WWMdtV1.jpg) outside in the courtyard, while I stroll around the showroom admiring all the latest motorcycles, generators, and golf carts that Yamaha has to offer. When it's finally time to leave I ask Essa if they accept VISA cards. ""No"", he says. ""There's nothing to pay, this is a gift"".

That night I meet Bahad again in the lobby. It's quiet, and he has time to chat. I ask him about his life in Nepal and his work here in Kuwait city, and he indulges my naivety with extreme politeness. He works five 10-hour shifts a week for 140 Kuwaiti Dinar or about 500 dollars a month. The hotel provides lodging and clothes, and the employees are allowed to take home any leftovers from the daily breakfast buffet. He much prefers the clean hotel environment over construction work, even though the latter pays better. Every day before heading to his little apartment he fills a jerrycan with drinking water from the giant filter in the hotel basement, greatly reducing his living expenses. He sends home most of his salary and the tips he receives. He's not married, but the money provides for his widowed sister and her three children. Nearly 5000 dollars in the past year he explains, beaming with pride.

Crossing from [Kuwait into KSA](https://i.imgur.com/dOQjqOo.jpg) was easy, Kuwait uses the Carnet but KSA has their own vehicle registration system. It took them a few minutes to correctly register my plate as the system kept trying to input it right-to-left the Arabic way, but overall it didn‚Äôt take long. I had my visa pre-arranged, the conditions of which were pretty awesome (140 dollars for a 12-month multiple entry visa including health insurance), and every KSA crossing I did had at least one person who spoke more than a bit of English. I got a lot of interested looks at these border posts, people wanting to take pictures, handing me water, and snacks. They only know my country as ‚ÄòHulanda‚Äô in Arabic, so I often had to explain what the NL on my plate stood for.

Bahrain is a fascinating place, a little island nation connected to KSA through a long causeway built in the 80‚Äôies by Dutch company Ballast Nedam. Bahrain discovered long ago that oil revenues don‚Äôt last forever, and they started attracting business and tourists with a huge financial sector, giant malls, and the GP of course. Saudis refer to it as the Las Vegas of the Middle East. Despite it being essentially a Muslim Emirate there‚Äôs pork, [alcohol](https://i.imgur.com/EelXbrB.jpg), night clubs, [weird souvenirs](https://i.imgur.com/ajdZhPY.jpg), and even prostitution. KSA prohibits most of these things, and as a result Bahrain is filled to the brim with Saudi tourists coming over for a few days to have their fill, then heading off into piety again. It appears that KSA has significant control over the Bahraini government, and both are mostly happy with the arrangement. Riyadh knows that it‚Äôs impossible to completely forbid these things, and they much prefer having them in a controlled environment just off the coast, behind a border, so they can keep up the pretense of purity for their own country.

As a result of all this tourism the KSA-Bahraini border is extremely efficient and speedy. It‚Äôs essentially a stop along the highway, which by definition means there‚Äôs no space or time for extended controls or they‚Äôll just cause a massive traffic jam. Visa is on arrival, 5 bucks, and you can even pay by card lmao. The bike was a little more work, I had to walk into the customs office to get the Carnet stamped. An older officer pointed me to a desk with a very young girl in uniform behind it, she had never seen a Carnet before so me and the old guy talked her through it. Both spoke decent English and were very friendly, and I got the usual offerings of tea and bottled water.

The capital Manama is a strange place, it was murderously hot so walking around town I was ducking into air conditioned bus stops (!) and coffee shops to cool down. Everything is expensive but not terribly so, and at the same time there‚Äôs the same business-district-blandness to most of it. Except for the old town with numerous shops and markets, delicious food from all over the world, and lots of life in the street. I talked to some of the migrant workers in the restaurants and one of them told me loads of Saudis come to Manama to get wasted, then wreck their car drunk driving, but they just scrap it and buy a new one in Damman before heading back home. The scenes on the streets were more varied than in KSA or Kuwait, lots of families from different backgrounds. It was interesting to see that even Saudi men, wearing their Thawb, the formal white robe, have girlfriends or wives, and children that they show affection for when their environment allows for it. My stupid Western brain never really considered this. Dress for women ranged from all-covered for the pious Muslims to not covered at all for most tourists and migrant workers, and everything in between.

From Bahrain I rode back through KSA [to Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/mdd6v9A.jpg). Too early for and not much to do with the World Cup, I just wanted to [see](https://i.imgur.com/fUFFTWi.jpg) the [place](https://i.imgur.com/GpPzMTU.jpg) I guess. It‚Äôs only a hundred miles as the crow flies from Manama to Doha, but there‚Äôs a huge bay in-between which means it took all day. KSA borders were friendly and efficient as before, but the Qatari customs messed with my Carnet, tore out an entire page and refused to elaborate. I took some pictures and a video and contacted ADAC that evening but they said it should be OK. The customs guys got really upset when while filming the Carnet, I lifted the camera up, and demanded I delete the footage. But they didn‚Äôt make me empty the recycle bin lol.

[Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/ZPAT8Yv.jpg) is largely similar to Kuwait, one single big city with not much around, cars everywhere. The Qataris themselves are rich, and [migrants do all the work](https://i.imgur.com/vhTtUtR.jpg). You‚Äôve seen the stories surrounding the world cup no doubt. Doha was also scorching hot, but thankfully a bit easier to walk around than Kuwait City. One month before the WC started there was construction going on everywhere, day and night. The stadiums were pretty much finished but they were still building hotels, walkways, parks, and god knows what else. I talked to some of the Indian workers and they confirmed pretty much everything the news has been saying about Qatar, but they also said they weren‚Äôt entirely unhappy with the situation. They make good money to send home, they get lots of breaks during the hottest parts of the day, and food and lodging is taken care of, depending on which company they work for. It‚Äôs hard work for (looking from the West) meagre pay, but they come here because it‚Äôs much better than what they‚Äôd get back home. Doha again is a pretty bland city, the [old Souk Waaqif](https://i.imgur.com/q0Nw7Bh.jpg) is interesting to walk around with loads of [little shops and craftsmen](https://i.imgur.com/Xrt822d.jpg), but it‚Äôs also extremely touristic and expensive. The best place to me was the [Museum of Islamic Art](https://i.imgur.com/dSQEo2D.jpg), which had a lot of fascinating artefacts and stories from [all over the Middle East](https://i.imgur.com/J7lt9mY.jpg). In Qatar I also came across a [Saudi football fan](https://i.imgur.com/wW7dUSX.jpg) who had been hiking through the desert for months to make it to Doha for the world cup. Even the police wanted to [take pictures with him](https://i.imgur.com/RLLIZkq.jpg).

Now by the time I was in Doha I had started thinking of my return leg. I got some worrying messages that Ethiopia had pretty much closed its borders to foreign motor vehicles, demanding tens of thousands of dollars as collateral at the border. I had really wanted to go to Egypt, but that also was quite expensive to arrange, and then I‚Äôd have the problem of getting the bike out. Transport by air is crazy expensive (5000 to 7000 dollars, plus needs to be drained of all fluids), so I decided to dig into my contact list for an alternative option. Someone had suggested to me some time ago that it‚Äôs possible to ship vehicles from Israel to Greece on a RORO transport (meaning vehicles only, no passengers), which is far cheaper than flying. So I got in touch with Rosenfeld Shipping in Haifa, who informed me they had a weekly service to Lavrion in Greece, which for a motorcycle would only be about 700 dollars. That seemed mighty fine to me, so off towards Haifa I went. 

From Doha to the Jordan border is nearly 2000km, [straight through the desert](https://i.imgur.com/hpJa4s5.jpg). It took me [three day](https://i.imgur.com/RoEBXYc.jpg)s, first to Riyadh, then Hail, and lastly Qurayyat. I was carrying about [3L of water and some food](https://i.imgur.com/3JLBE59.jpg), and even though I was drinking a lot in the desert I never got in trouble in KSA, there‚Äôs always a bit of traffic around and it‚Äôs easy to stock up at gas stations. Although it was a similar [desert](https://i.imgur.com/3cbkMeb.jpg) to Western Sahara it felt much more [‚Äòcivilized‚Äô](https://i.imgur.com/mawQYXp.jpg) because of this. I really wish I could‚Äôve [stayed a bit longer](https://i.imgur.com/bTdC9W9.jpg) in KSA because it‚Äôs a fascinating place. Politically and religiously it‚Äôs obviously a disgusting mess, but the landscapes are spectacular, the people are almost crazy friendly, and riding through the desert for so long really is a boring yet also fascinating experience. [Hours upon hours of nothingness](https://i.imgur.com/7FzOtxN.jpg), even [gas stations](https://i.imgur.com/aB9sisb.jpg) are rare, with sometimes 200+ km between them. There is occasional traffic, and the truck drivers honk and wave back. Giant power lines follow the roads and camels are everywhere. Concrete husks of old gas stations, guard posts and other things are occasionally seen on the side of the road. But above all there is sand, silence, and asphalt. I got lucky with the weather. It was hot but not outrageously so, around 30 degrees during the day, and I even caught a speck of rain around Hail. Also a sandstorm just west of Riyadh which was surreal, everything around you dark yellow and brown, the road below and the sky above covered in streams of sand and dust.

People in the street [looked at me with great interest](https://i.imgur.com/MWKPNDb.jpg) and wanted to talk a lot. In Hail I met a group of Saudi and Chinese visitors who worked in some manufacturing industry who fawned over the bike and wanted to know all about my trip. I ran out of Saudi Riyals in Qurayyat on Thursday evening, and walked into town trying to find a place to get something to eat. On the way a Saudi driver hailed me, guy in a big Pajero, traditional dress. He asked if I was a tourist (yes), and how I was enjoying KSA so far (fine). He asked if I needed anything? So I said well, I need to change some euro‚Äôs for Riyals, about 50 euro‚Äôs worth? He got out his phone and worked out that would be about 175 Riyals. So he took out his wallet and handed me 350 Riyals in exchange for my 50 euros. I tried to convince him otherwise but he wasn‚Äôt having it, so he literally just gave me 50 euro‚Äôs for nothing. He just wanted me to have a good time and be able to buy food and pay for the fees at the border the next day. The hospitality of some of these people truly boggles the mind.

The border with Jordan was rather easy, if expensive. One Jordanian Dinar is about 1 euro 50, and it cost a small fortune to cross: visa (40JD), motorcycle (20JD), motorcycle insurance (36JD), SIM card (14JD). In Jordan I went down the length of the country towards Wadi Rum that same day, on highway 5 through the (Jordanian) Eastern Desert. Like KSA this part of the country was extremely sparsely populated, but at one point I randomly came across two dozen bikes parked on the side of the road and a bunch of guys having lunch. Turned out to be the Amman Motorcycle Club on their weekly tour. They even had a follow car with fuel, water, and a trailer for emergencies. As soon as I stopped I was swarmed by these [jovial guys](https://i.imgur.com/SnYUgpX.jpg) and they immediately handed me some water and snickers bars. We spent some time chatting and eating before going our separate ways. 

Jordan is the second recommendation I'd like to make. The country is small, the parts worth visiting are relatively close together. [Wadi Rum](https://i.imgur.com/CXC89O9.jpg) and [Petra](https://i.imgur.com/Rg4TVlj.jpg) have long been famous and they are worth every second and every penny. It is truly a wonderful, elating feeling to [ride around the desert](https://i.imgur.com/LDDIM4b.jpg) [between the colossal red mesa-like rocks](https://i.imgur.com/aVKe8Tg.jpg) in all sorts of fascinating shapes at Wadi Rum. Petra instead is human made, ‚Äòthe rose-colored city half as old as time itself‚Äô. Already famous in Roman times its location was ‚Äòlost‚Äô for a bit until being rediscovered last century. An entire city worth of buildings, caves, dwellings, [temples](https://i.imgur.com/feeWyot.jpg) carved out of red sandstone, with a fascinating water management system and a huge amphitheater to top it off. From Petra on I rode north following the Dead Sea. The roads across the central Jordanian mountain range were very pretty and [very quiet](https://i.imgur.com/kTLeOqz.jpg). Further north there were lots of kitschy shops selling Dead Sea sand, mud, face masks, all that jazz. Closer to Amman there suddenly was a lot of traffic, and the city itself is massive and sprawling, there‚Äôs not a lot of high rise so with 4 million people it covers a mind-boggling area. I spent a few days there and around Jerash. Amman has loads of interesting sights as well as a pretty decent street and night life, I went to see the Jordan Museum which had some really nice exhibitions and [historical artifacts](https://i.imgur.com/27s8IrM.jpg), the original [Hejaz railway station](https://i.imgur.com/Xpp4EFK.jpg), as well as the Citadel which offers great views of the city center. Jerash has a huge archaeological park with a well preserved [Roman street](https://i.imgur.com/31LjZHW.jpg), and the surrounding hills are dotted with villages and olive orchards. Riding around this part of Jordan isn‚Äôt super interesting in an of itself, it was fairly wet and cold while I was there and the roads are super busy.",1,1757699997.0,motorcycles,2,1.0,False

*This is a composition of different bits I've written in the past few years, I've put them all together and added pictures*

Three years ago in August 2022 I departed home in the Netherlands for a tour of the Middle East. I covered 22.000km in about four months, through desert and snow, across 22 countries, 15 of which were new to me. I met a large number of amazingly curious and kind people, had one of the worst days of my life struggling with Iraqi bureaucracy, and saw some of the most gorgeous landscapes this planet has to offer. [The Tiger did well](https://i.imgur.com/jTQelSl.jpg), with no problems whatsoever. It had a major service earlier this year, with a new chain and tires (Metzeler Karoo Street) at the start of this trip. I did two oil changes while on the road and that was it basically. I was carrying an assortment of tools and spare parts just in case, but I didn‚Äôt need any of it. Perhaps the [lucky charm](https://i.imgur.com/mck3csu.jpg) that one of my former coworkers knitted for me helped :)

Please forgive me for the meagre amount of photographs. It‚Äôs never been my strong suit, traveling alone I just don‚Äôt stop nearly often enough to take pictures.

**Part 1: Netherlands to Naples**

*All of it was made for you and me / 'Cause it just belongs to you and me / So let's take a ride and see what's mine (Iggy Pop, 1977)*

I left home in August, riding down through Germany to Switzerland and [into](https://i.imgur.com/gXiAYo0.jpg) the [alps](https://i.imgur.com/KUAp03S.jpg). I wanted to do a few hikes around the [ski resorts](https://i.imgur.com/HSX5Mjl.jpg) that I normally only see in winter, and take some of the passes that I hadn‚Äôt so far, notably the [Col Maddelena](https://i.imgur.com/yC8wolo.jpg) and the [Col de la Bonnette](https://i.imgur.com/LAQQeq0.jpg). Also came across the town of Roubion [perched high on a hilltop](https://i.imgur.com/GT8qmDr.jpg). I spent a few days in [Milan](https://i.imgur.com/0l90qMS.jpg) chilling with friends, then headed back up into the Alps to go around the usual suspects, and some of my favorite passes: Albula, Stelvio, and Bernina. East through Austria on the Silvretta, then south through the Brenner, taking the local road this time instead of the motorway, and then south-east by Cortina d‚ÄôAmpezzo towards Venice. I‚Äôd never been to the canal city before, and I was surprised at the size of it. I had imagined something smaller, more bunched up, but it was far larger and more typically Italian than I‚Äôd thought. Dirty abandoned alleys alongside romantic canal side restaurants, beggars and dogs alongside tourists from pretty much all over the world. A nice experience, but not nearly as spectacular as I was made to believe. 

From there on I headed east to visit friends in Hungary, and I got absolutely soaked the last few hours towards Balaton. It was a warm kind of rainstorm thankfully, so not terribly uncomfortable. We spent two days [hiking](https://i.imgur.com/qCJkCHt.jpg) and [sailing](https://i.imgur.com/MvRg7xd.jpg) around Balaton, before I took off again back towards Venice, stopping around Trieste, [Rimini](https://i.imgur.com/oHexagp.jpg), Florence, and [Pisa](https://i.imgur.com/AdDgEG5.jpg), from where I took the [ferry to Corsica](https://i.imgur.com/CmQHNn6.jpg). Northern Italy is quite flat and boring at times, but between San Marino and Florence there are some gorgeous low mountain passes through thick forests and quiet little villages.

Corsica is my first real recommendation to anyone reading this. It‚Äôs French, but don‚Äôt say that too loud, the Corsicans are fiercely independent and [anti-French graffiti](https://i.imgur.com/pfAAgBP.jpg) and posters are everywhere. The island is basically a [mountain range](https://i.imgur.com/x7eQzMW.jpg) [rising from the sea](https://i.imgur.com/L69tTh4.jpg), with [scarcely a straight road around](https://i.imgur.com/qKSOZ4z.jpg). The [coast](https://i.imgur.com/B4Z4bbA.jpg) is mostly [rocky hills](https://i.imgur.com/R8c9oyw.jpg), with innumerable bridges, tunnels, and little seaside villages. [Inland](https://i.imgur.com/EnnXBCu.jpg) is [a bit greener](https://i.imgur.com/yXdebSo.jpg), with scavenging [pigs](https://i.imgur.com/AcAgMEa.jpg) all [around](https://i.imgur.com/zjlHfea.jpg) and sweet hiking trails and a few beautiful [mountain passes](https://i.imgur.com/wHlmsU9.jpg). It's moderately priced too, with affordable BnB‚Äôs and hostels dotted around the cities, campsites throughout the interior, and a tasty twist on French Mediterranean cuisine. It‚Äôs quite small too, and easy to get around despite the curvy madness that is the roads. Whether you like riding, hiking, cycling or simply cruising around taking in the atmosphere, you can‚Äôt really go wrong with Corsica.

From Bonifacio in the south I took the [ferry to Sardegna](https://i.imgur.com/HRfdY39.jpg), which is much larger than Corsica, very Italian, but also culturally distinct from the mainland. The [landscapes](https://i.imgur.com/Jp04Ofd.jpg) are a [bit more varied](https://i.imgur.com/YktQv4u.jpg), with [gorgeous coastlines in the west](https://i.imgur.com/7Z9WMXT.jpg), mountains in the east, and agricultural land and some larger cities in-between. There‚Äôs more to see than just nature though: fascinating megalithic ruins known as the [Nuraghi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuraghe) dot the landscape. Considered ancient ruins already in Roman times, they may have been fortress, house, storage room or temple, their exact purpose remains unknown but there are thousands of them in varying sizes and states of repair all over the island. I found one close to Cagliari that offered a gorgeous view of the city and the harbor. Around Sassari I did a day-long guided [horseback tour](https://i.imgur.com/AroGPqY.jpg). Not having brought my equipment I had to ride in my shorts which seemed like a terrible idea at first, but in the end it didn‚Äôt bother me much. We had an awesome time, riding through farmland across old gravel roads, by ancient churches, and murky pools full of giant tadpoles and salamanders.

In Cagliari I took the ferry to Palermo; a few hours before boarding I came across a French couple in the harbor on a large KTM adventure bike which had battery problems. Together with the Italian AAA we managed to get the bike [loaded on a trailer](https://i.imgur.com/00YtXLc.jpg) and brought to the ship in time for our sailing. The 12 hour boat ride offered a [gorgeous sunset](https://i.imgur.com/NcjTM9L.jpg) and subsequent sunrise again not long after. Once in Palermo the next morning we pushed their bike out the boat to the port where another AAA vehicle was waiting to take it to a garage. 

Now Sicily I was not too impressed with. Palermo and Syracuse are decent enough cities with interesting sights, and here are some exceptional monuments around such as the [Valley of the Temples](https://i.imgur.com/iClcJc0.jpg), [Taormina](https://i.imgur.com/xWKC7MM.jpg), [Siracusa](https://i.imgur.com/UrjsPSJ.jpg), and Piazza Armeria, but in between these highlights the island is poor and filthy. Infrastructure is in an abysmal state, the city peripheries are filthy and stifled with traffic, and lodging and food in the touristy areas is pretty expensive. Giant piles of garbage, plastic, and whatnot are everywhere, as are derelict buildings and abandoned farms and industry. I had a good time, especially the mosaics at Piazza Armeria are [absolutely stunning](https://i.imgur.com/2WryKNl.jpg), and climbing Etna was a unique experience but the entire island gave me a strong feeling of ‚Äòlost potential‚Äô. With just a little more effort and investment it could be an absolutely great destination, but we all know why that isn‚Äôt happening.

From Sicily I took yet another ferry back to the Italian mainland, and slalomed through the [nose of the boot](https://i.imgur.com/JTNc1LU.jpg) towards Naples. [Calabria](https://i.imgur.com/4i4MoAK.jpg) is known for being under Mafia control to a huge degree, perhaps more so than Sicily. It‚Äôs a bit cleaner as well, and features many [pretty mountaintop towns](https://i.imgur.com/2htIGcH.jpg), even the odd ski resort, and [huge forested hill ranges](https://i.imgur.com/KNE7kNc.jpg). Not [an area of Italy](https://i.imgur.com/kFq99cO.jpg) [I was very familiar with](https://i.imgur.com/ZGw6C5A.jpg), it‚Äôs definitely on my list to go back to one day. In Naples I had an appointment with the local Triumph dealer for some maintenance and storage, as I had to fly home for a few days to attend a wedding.

**Part 2: Naples to Kuwait**

*Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command / Your old road is rapidly agin' (Bob Dylan, 1964)*

While all of the above was happening, trouble broke out in Iran. I had my VISA pre-arranged for pickup in Ankara, but not wanting to wait for things to get out of control I decided to make my way there ASAP. The initial plan had been to spend 2-3 weeks going around Greece and Turkey, but that can wait for another time. From Naples again through southern Italy to Bari and Brindisi, and then the [ferry to Igoumenitsa](https://i.imgur.com/hi51lge.jpg) in Greece. Straight shot through Greece to Thessaloniki in the pouring rain, and then into Turkey to Gallipoli. The border was an interesting experience, it‚Äôs basically a long, low bridge with guardhouses every few meters. Border formalities themselves were peanuts, but the sight on the bridge was interesting. The Turks and Greeks have a troubling history, and the guardhouses on each side were manned in full, young lads on the Greek side in full tacticool looking like something out of Call of Duty, whereas the Turks were dressed more like WW1 soldiers, old brown ragged uniforms. As you enter Turkey the differences grow steadily. Donkey carts and ancient tractors on the motor way, but also flashy modern cars. Expensive toll roads and [gas stations with WIFI](https://i.imgur.com/RtFAGhG.jpg), but also tiny villages with what can best be described as huts with sat TV dishes and rusty bicycles.

In Gallipoli harbor with a great view of the absolutely [enormous bridge across the Dardanelles](https://i.imgur.com/uVp4pi6.jpg) I came across a statue of Piri Reis, one of the first scholars to draw up detailed maps of the Mediterranean. I also got to chat with a shopkeeper and one of his sons, who were extremely critical of Erdogan and his ridiculous social and economic policies. The old man proudly showed me the app he had been using to learn English, and he didn‚Äôt mince words. Erdogan is a wannabe dictator, who‚Äôs using religion to control his people. And everywhere you go it‚Äôs there, even the tiniest 10-house village will have a shiny mosque, most likely built quite recently and subsidized by the government. Prayer call is everywhere, but the people in the cities are fed up with it. One of his sons was going off to Ankara to study civil engineering and he was already eyeing a job in Germany. According to them, the younger population is fed up with the conservative bullshit and dictatorial tendencies of the Erdogan and his cronies. They feel powerless however since he has strong support among the clergy and in the rural areas, so when they can they simply leave. 

In Ankara I went to the Iranian embassy to pick up my visa, and everything there was working as usual. Pictures of Khamenei (the religious dictator) and Soleimani (the general assassinated at Baghdad airport by the CIA in January 2020) were all over the waiting room. As the visa had already been granted online there were no questions, just some waiting, payment (75 euros), and pickup. 

From Ankara I went south, through Adana, Gaziantep, [Mardin](https://i.imgur.com/pYlwdrE.jpg) and eventually Yuksekova near the [Iranian border](https://i.imgur.com/UtUcxpu.jpg). The highland around Ankara was cold and windy, the canyon down towards the coast was absolutely gorgeous. Orange trees and olive plantations were everywhere, little farming villages with people working the land and collecting fruits in the orchards. I felt like I had gone 50 years back in time. Heading east the landscape slowly turned desert, the border with first Syria and later Iraq reminding me of Berlin, with giant walls, guard posts, and large swathes of barbed-wire no-mans-land. Everywhere I went and stayed the people were extremely friendly, not all of them spoke English but with google translate as assistance we had many conversations. They echoed the same sentiments as the people in Gallipoli, then again I stayed mostly in the cities. With the collapse of the Turkish Lira (due to Erdogan being an idiot) everything was crazy cheap, and of course Turkish food has a reputation already, so I had a great and affordable time. South-Eastern Turkey between Cizre and [Yuksekova](https://i.imgur.com/QRQiafZ.jpg) felt [desolate, but in a good way](https://i.imgur.com/S3Z32hX.jpg). There‚Äôs hardly any traffic, the road winds round and round the cliffs and gorges that form the border with Iraq. The landscape is beautiful brown/green (copper?) rocks with oases around the places where water collects. There‚Äôs occasional [military base](https://i.imgur.com/3WNzAN1.jpg)s and [checkpoints](https://i.imgur.com/D4umJkf.jpg) on the hilltops and around the passes, but these soldiers were mostly bored and quite surprised to see a traveler come by. I got offered tea a lot, and they wanted to talk about football and other worldly affairs.

The [border with Iran](https://i.imgur.com/kCPGxY4.jpg) was surprisingly easy. No sign of increased security or anything. I got to use the Carnet (import/export document for vehicles) for the first time, which was interesting. Thankfully the customs officer knew exactly what to do with it so the entire crossing was barely a 30-minute affair. Once in Iran I rode into Urmia to try and find a place to change some money, but it was a Friday, the Muslim rest day, so I was SOL since everything was closed. In one of the shopping centers I approached a group of young-ish guys (20-somethings?) and asked if they could help me out, and lo and behold after a short google-translate mediated conversation they arranged for about 50 euro‚Äôs worth of Iranian Rials. Their currency is hilariously worthless, so it came down to about 25 million Rials, a stack [the size of the LOTR single-volume](https://i.imgur.com/KVhMqj7.jpg). 

Everywhere I went in Iran people warned me not to go to the big cities: Tabriz, Tehran et cetera were considered extremely dangerous, as the regime had resorted to outright shooting at the protesters by now. I ended up staying only 4 days in Iran which was a bloody shame, I basically followed the Iraqi border south towards Khorramshahr and then crossed into Iraq. Part of this was Iranian Kurdistan which has historically not been as closely aligned to Tehran (or Baghdad, or Istanbul for that matter) as the rest of the country. Out of dozens upon dozens of encounters with [hotel employees](https://i.imgur.com/QzgkAon.jpg), shopkeepers, [students](https://i.imgur.com/RgUXO8h.jpg), even law enforcement, they all said the same thing more or less. They all want justice for Amini and the countless other killed or hurt by the regime, a lifting of the idiotic religious laws, and more freedoms and opportunities, especially the younger generation. One of the students installed a special VPN on my phone which allowed me to connect to the internet through his mobile hotspot, and at various restaurants and [hotels](https://i.imgur.com/i711CcP.jpg) through WIFI. Even then, the internet often went down for hours at a time. I also came across a rare sight, an [Iranian Suzuki GSXR](https://i.imgur.com/Pkgw21B.jpg), a pretty decent racer. No plates, no helmet, no problem.

[Walking around town](https://i.imgur.com/j7VMd6w.jpg), or just [sitting in a restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/ZYvpUSU.jpg) I got latched on to by groups of younger people wanting to hear about the world and share their story. They feel trapped in their country by the regime, which is plundering the economy and enriching itself at the cost of the population. They don‚Äôt give a shit about Russia, Israel, or the USA, and many are quite moderate when it comes to religion. There weren‚Äôt nearly as many mosques around as in Turkey, and most of the students weren‚Äôt openly religious at all. It was shocking how eager they were to talk about these highly sensitive topics. It gave me a huge blocking feeling of helplessness, hearing these people lament their dictators, wishing, hoping, for a better future where they‚Äôd have a free life, work, be able to travel, be in touch with the world. Keep in mind though this was only in one particular area of the country, the west/northwest along the border with Iraq. I don‚Äôt know if this is representative for the population as a whole. The famous Arab hospitality is all around in Iran as well, multiple times in restaurants other guests stood up and wanted to pay for me, other times people bought me snacks and drinks just for talking to them for a while. I usually tried to accept gracefully and then sneak in payment any way.

In Sanandaj I asked my hotel if it was safe to walk into town to find a restaurant and the lady answered (in fluent English!) that it most certainly wasn‚Äôt, but she could call me a taxi and instruct him to take me by some restaurants? Which I happily agreed to. We drove around town for about two hours, conversing through google translate again. He showed me some monuments, and places were protests had escalated recently, burned out armored vehicles and cars lined the road. Around the main square there were 100+ police and soldiers with big guns (APCs and such) standing around, the giant roundabout next to them full of cars, honking incessantly as a provocation. Some of the drivers even yelled at the police, it was a frightening scene. We then went to a little restaurant to eat kebabs, and the driver showed me pictures of an older man from his neighborhood, who had been shot the week before during a protest. Some girl had lain injured in the street and the old guy (60, 70?) had ran out to help her and they‚Äôd just gunned down both of them. He told me that he didn‚Äôt expect these protests to die down easily, because so many people had been killed and hurt: every time they have a funeral, the victims friends and family gathers, and the anger flares up again. Same with the 40-day Shia mourning period, after which they meet again and the same thing happens. Later that night there were gunshots and explosions in town, about 1-2 miles from my hotel. My heart breaks for these people. It‚Äôs going to take a lot of bloodshed, but I hope they get the freedoms they so strongly desire, and are willing to die for.

As for the riding, Iran is absolutely huge, and has hugely varied landscapes and I‚Äôve only been to a small part of it. The northwest is a [high plateau dotted with hills](https://i.imgur.com/3OJLulW.jpg), mountains to the west in Turkey, and with a large salt lake next to Urmia. Due to climate change the once enormous lake is now little more than a huge salt flat with some wet spots. Towards the south are beautiful hills and [mountain ranges](https://i.imgur.com/fGBXEDB.jpg), canyons, dry riverbeds, and occasional agriculture. As I went further south the landscape slowly became flatter, with [large-scale agriculture](https://i.imgur.com/THOqFYN.jpg) and huge irrigation projects around. Even further south around the Persian Gulf it becomes a proper desert, scorching hot during the day, cool in the nights. [Giant oil refineries](https://i.imgur.com/Iz1asQP.jpg) tower over enormous featureless deserts, long roads with barely any traffic going seemingly nowhere, vanishing into the horizon. [Infrastructure is generally good](https://i.imgur.com/Pu80g7Y.jpg), roads are decent and there‚Äôs even AAA around, trucks with towing equipment providing roadside assistance (indicative of a fairly sophisticated society, in my book). Gas is only about 5 cents a liter, and every time you stop people want to make conversation, you‚Äôre offered tea, baclava, snacks, people want to take pictures with you ‚Äì but at the same time it maintains a certain kind of innocence. There aren‚Äôt a whole lot of tourists in Iran outside the main cities, and I had several people including gas station attendants come up to me shyly, asking in their best English where I was from, what I thought of their country, and if they could please take a photo with me? It was almost endearing at times. Gave me goosebumps, especially considering the international isolation, economic problems, and murderous dictatorship bullshit these people are going through. Not a single time did I feel unsafe, even the more serious looking Basiji/Revolutionary Guard checkpoints were generally courteous and speedy. One thing I‚Äôd like to add here is how forward-thinking the hospitality of many of these people was. From Turkey to Qatar all the way to Israel I got offered more than a dozen phone numbers, with the following reasoning: ‚ÄúHere, take my number. If you‚Äôre ever in front of someone who doesn‚Äôt speak English, call me, give them the phone, and I will translate for you‚Äù. 

In Khorramabad I got spooked a bit, and decided not to stretch my luck and go straight to the Iraqi border and on to Kuwait the next day. Getting out of Iran was easy, but getting into Iraq ended up a crazy struggle with bureaucracy. [I recorded the story later that night](https://soundcloud.com/user909842478/bureaucracy-and-humanity/s-mH9rQ1jaxe2?si=d926794ac5d9418c8fe6d9eb8c8c6d13) in my hotel in Kuwait. It‚Äôs a bit of a long sit at 30 minutes, but if you want to hear a crazy tale of foreign border crossings it might be worth it.

From the audio story: [this is what the Kuwaiti highway 80 looked like](https://i.imgur.com/xtWWEXn.jpg) after the chaotic Iraqi withdrawal during the Gulf War, during which their columns got annihilated by the USAF. Also, [the Kuwaiti customs officials that helped me so nicely](https://i.imgur.com/9pqvmE5.jpg).



**Part 3: Kuwait to Jordan**

*You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name / It felt good to be out of the rain (America, 1971)*

From Kuwait I went on through Saudi Arabia (KSA), to Bahrain and Qatar. Kuwait city wasn‚Äôt very appealing, the city is huge and nobody walks, everyone drives their giant fucking cars everywhere, even though gas isn‚Äôt particularly cheap at about 50 cents a liter. I spent some time around the [water front](https://i.imgur.com/OLqGMW0.jpg) and in the old markets, but [walking around the city](https://i.imgur.com/s74j5ty.jpg) was a PITA because [everything is designed around cars and cars only](https://i.imgur.com/ZCMt7qU.jpg), they really took the wrong lessons from the Americans that stayed after the war. There are some monuments and minor other interesting buildings around, but apart from that it feels like the business district of any other major city. [At least their money is very pretty](https://i.imgur.com/MujG89H.jpg). Two things happened in Kuwait that I want to describe in a little more detail.

When I pulled up to my hotel (City Tower Kuwait, at 80$ a night one of the cheapest hotels in town) a short man with a little black-and-white hat greets me enthusiastically, and gestures where he'd like me to park. Despite my best attempts to dissuade him he insists on carrying my bags to the elevator after I've checked in, and explains that I can use the wheelchair ramp to park the motorcycle right next to the entrance where the reception can keep an eye on it twenty-four-seven. Later, after I've showered the desert sand out of my hair I come across him taking note of the cars parked in front of the hotel in a little booklet. He's impressed with the motorcycle and brings me tea while I sit down to clean and grease the chain. His name is Bahad from Nepal, and he has been in Kuwait for five years now, working for the same hotel all that time. First as room service and cleaner, now as parking attendant and customer representative. The entire country runs on immigrant labor: native Kuwaiti people receive a handsome stipend from the government simply for existing, and as a result they tend not to do any labor. They own most of the businesses though, while people like Bahad do the actual work.

The next morning I went to the Yamaha dealership for an oil change. The service representative initially refuses because my bike is a Triumph and not a Yamaha, but since I got the new filter with me and oil is, well, oil, I convince him to call his boss for me. Essa, a Kuwaiti, raises his eyebrows after seeing my license plate, then shakes my hand warmly and assures me that everything will be alright. His mechanics will take good care of my bike he promises, and asks if I would prefer tea, coffee, or an iced beverage while I wait. I watch as the Indian mechanics roll the bike into the shop, and after receiving a mug of fresh coffee from the garage's bartender I follow them inside. The fully blind shop cat is purring away in the corner, while several machines are being worked on. A Yamaha racer stands gutted on one of the lifts, its engine being revised on the table next to it. Two workers are busy installing floodlights onto a shiny new dune buggy. After the [oil change](https://i.imgur.com/1btpfgH.jpg) the Indian crew checks the tire pressure and fluids, then gives the bike a [thorough wash](https://i.imgur.com/WWMdtV1.jpg) outside in the courtyard, while I stroll around the showroom admiring all the latest motorcycles, generators, and golf carts that Yamaha has to offer. When it's finally time to leave I ask Essa if they accept VISA cards. ""No"", he says. ""There's nothing to pay, this is a gift"".

That night I meet Bahad again in the lobby. It's quiet, and he has time to chat. I ask him about his life in Nepal and his work here in Kuwait city, and he indulges my naivety with extreme politeness. He works five 10-hour shifts a week for 140 Kuwaiti Dinar or about 500 dollars a month. The hotel provides lodging and clothes, and the employees are allowed to take home any leftovers from the daily breakfast buffet. He much prefers the clean hotel environment over construction work, even though the latter pays better. Every day before heading to his little apartment he fills a jerrycan with drinking water from the giant filter in the hotel basement, greatly reducing his living expenses. He sends home most of his salary and the tips he receives. He's not married, but the money provides for his widowed sister and her three children. Nearly 5000 dollars in the past year he explains, beaming with pride.

Crossing from [Kuwait into KSA](https://i.imgur.com/dOQjqOo.jpg) was easy, Kuwait uses the Carnet but KSA has their own vehicle registration system. It took them a few minutes to correctly register my plate as the system kept trying to input it right-to-left the Arabic way, but overall it didn‚Äôt take long. I had my visa pre-arranged, the conditions of which were pretty awesome (140 dollars for a 12-month multiple entry visa including health insurance), and every KSA crossing I did had at least one person who spoke more than a bit of English. I got a lot of interested looks at these border posts, people wanting to take pictures, handing me water, and snacks. They only know my country as ‚ÄòHulanda‚Äô in Arabic, so I often had to explain what the NL on my plate stood for.

Bahrain is a fascinating place, a little island nation connected to KSA through a long causeway built in the 80‚Äôies by Dutch company Ballast Nedam. Bahrain discovered long ago that oil revenues don‚Äôt last forever, and they started attracting business and tourists with a huge financial sector, giant malls, and the GP of course. Saudis refer to it as the Las Vegas of the Middle East. Despite it being essentially a Muslim Emirate there‚Äôs pork, [alcohol](https://i.imgur.com/EelXbrB.jpg), night clubs, [weird souvenirs](https://i.imgur.com/ajdZhPY.jpg), and even prostitution. KSA prohibits most of these things, and as a result Bahrain is filled to the brim with Saudi tourists coming over for a few days to have their fill, then heading off into piety again. It appears that KSA has significant control over the Bahraini government, and both are mostly happy with the arrangement. Riyadh knows that it‚Äôs impossible to completely forbid these things, and they much prefer having them in a controlled environment just off the coast, behind a border, so they can keep up the pretense of purity for their own country.

As a result of all this tourism the KSA-Bahraini border is extremely efficient and speedy. It‚Äôs essentially a stop along the highway, which by definition means there‚Äôs no space or time for extended controls or they‚Äôll just cause a massive traffic jam. Visa is on arrival, 5 bucks, and you can even pay by card lmao. The bike was a little more work, I had to walk into the customs office to get the Carnet stamped. An older officer pointed me to a desk with a very young girl in uniform behind it, she had never seen a Carnet before so me and the old guy talked her through it. Both spoke decent English and were very friendly, and I got the usual offerings of tea and bottled water.

The capital Manama is a strange place, it was murderously hot so walking around town I was ducking into air conditioned bus stops (!) and coffee shops to cool down. Everything is expensive but not terribly so, and at the same time there‚Äôs the same business-district-blandness to most of it. Except for the old town with numerous shops and markets, delicious food from all over the world, and lots of life in the street. I talked to some of the migrant workers in the restaurants and one of them told me loads of Saudis come to Manama to get wasted, then wreck their car drunk driving, but they just scrap it and buy a new one in Damman before heading back home. The scenes on the streets were more varied than in KSA or Kuwait, lots of families from different backgrounds. It was interesting to see that even Saudi men, wearing their Thawb, the formal white robe, have girlfriends or wives, and children that they show affection for when their environment allows for it. My stupid Western brain never really considered this. Dress for women ranged from all-covered for the pious Muslims to not covered at all for most tourists and migrant workers, and everything in between.

From Bahrain I rode back through KSA [to Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/mdd6v9A.jpg). Too early for and not much to do with the World Cup, I just wanted to [see](https://i.imgur.com/fUFFTWi.jpg) the [place](https://i.imgur.com/GpPzMTU.jpg) I guess. It‚Äôs only a hundred miles as the crow flies from Manama to Doha, but there‚Äôs a huge bay in-between which means it took all day. KSA borders were friendly and efficient as before, but the Qatari customs messed with my Carnet, tore out an entire page and refused to elaborate. I took some pictures and a video and contacted ADAC that evening but they said it should be OK. The customs guys got really upset when while filming the Carnet, I lifted the camera up, and demanded I delete the footage. But they didn‚Äôt make me empty the recycle bin lol.

[Qatar](https://i.imgur.com/ZPAT8Yv.jpg) is largely similar to Kuwait, one single big city with not much around, cars everywhere. The Qataris themselves are rich, and [migrants do all the work](https://i.imgur.com/vhTtUtR.jpg). You‚Äôve seen the stories surrounding the world cup no doubt. Doha was also scorching hot, but thankfully a bit easier to walk around than Kuwait City. One month before the WC started there was construction going on everywhere, day and night. The stadiums were pretty much finished but they were still building hotels, walkways, parks, and god knows what else. I talked to some of the Indian workers and they confirmed pretty much everything the news has been saying about Qatar, but they also said they weren‚Äôt entirely unhappy with the situation. They make good money to send home, they get lots of breaks during the hottest parts of the day, and food and lodging is taken care of, depending on which company they work for. It‚Äôs hard work for (looking from the West) meagre pay, but they come here because it‚Äôs much better than what they‚Äôd get back home. Doha again is a pretty bland city, the [old Souk Waaqif](https://i.imgur.com/q0Nw7Bh.jpg) is interesting to walk around with loads of [little shops and craftsmen](https://i.imgur.com/Xrt822d.jpg), but it‚Äôs also extremely touristic and expensive. The best place to me was the [Museum of Islamic Art](https://i.imgur.com/dSQEo2D.jpg), which had a lot of fascinating artefacts and stories from [all over the Middle East](https://i.imgur.com/J7lt9mY.jpg). In Qatar I also came across a [Saudi football fan](https://i.imgur.com/wW7dUSX.jpg) who had been hiking through the desert for months to make it to Doha for the world cup. Even the police wanted to [take pictures with him](https://i.imgur.com/RLLIZkq.jpg).

Now by the time I was in Doha I had started thinking of my return leg. I got some worrying messages that Ethiopia had pretty much closed its borders to foreign motor vehicles, demanding tens of thousands of dollars as collateral at the border. I had really wanted to go to Egypt, but that also was quite expensive to arrange, and then I‚Äôd have the problem of getting the bike out. Transport by air is crazy expensive (5000 to 7000 dollars, plus needs to be drained of all fluids), so I decided to dig into my contact list for an alternative option. Someone had suggested to me some time ago that it‚Äôs possible to ship vehicles from Israel to Greece on a RORO transport (meaning vehicles only, no passengers), which is far cheaper than flying. So I got in touch with Rosenfeld Shipping in Haifa, who informed me they had a weekly service to Lavrion in Greece, which for a motorcycle would only be about 700 dollars. That seemed mighty fine to me, so off towards Haifa I went. 

From Doha to the Jordan border is nearly 2000km, [straight through the desert](https://i.imgur.com/hpJa4s5.jpg). It took me [three day](https://i.imgur.com/RoEBXYc.jpg)s, first to Riyadh, then Hail, and lastly Qurayyat. I was carrying about [3L of water and some food](https://i.imgur.com/3JLBE59.jpg), and even though I was drinking a lot in the desert I never got in trouble in KSA, there‚Äôs always a bit of traffic around and it‚Äôs easy to stock up at gas stations. Although it was a similar [desert](https://i.imgur.com/3cbkMeb.jpg) to Western Sahara it felt much more [‚Äòcivilized‚Äô](https://i.imgur.com/mawQYXp.jpg) because of this. I really wish I could‚Äôve [stayed a bit longer](https://i.imgur.com/bTdC9W9.jpg) in KSA because it‚Äôs a fascinating place. Politically and religiously it‚Äôs obviously a disgusting mess, but the landscapes are spectacular, the people are almost crazy friendly, and riding through the desert for so long really is a boring yet also fascinating experience. [Hours upon hours of nothingness](https://i.imgur.com/7FzOtxN.jpg), even [gas stations](https://i.imgur.com/aB9sisb.jpg) are rare, with sometimes 200+ km between them. There is occasional traffic, and the truck drivers honk and wave back. Giant power lines follow the roads and camels are everywhere. Concrete husks of old gas stations, guard posts and other things are occasionally seen on the side of the road. But above all there is sand, silence, and asphalt. I got lucky with the weather. It was hot but not outrageously so, around 30 degrees during the day, and I even caught a speck of rain around Hail. Also a sandstorm just west of Riyadh which was surreal, everything around you dark yellow and brown, the road below and the sky above covered in streams of sand and dust.

People in the street [looked at me with great interest](https://i.imgur.com/MWKPNDb.jpg) and wanted to talk a lot. In Hail I met a group of Saudi and Chinese visitors who worked in some manufacturing industry who fawned over the bike and wanted to know all about my trip. I ran out of Saudi Riyals in Qurayyat on Thursday evening, and walked into town trying to find a place to get something to eat. On the way a Saudi driver hailed me, guy in a big Pajero, traditional dress. He asked if I was a tourist (yes), and how I was enjoying KSA so far (fine). He asked if I needed anything? So I said well, I need to change some euro‚Äôs for Riyals, about 50 euro‚Äôs worth? He got out his phone and worked out that would be about 175 Riyals. So he took out his wallet and handed me 350 Riyals in exchange for my 50 euros. I tried to convince him otherwise but he wasn‚Äôt having it, so he literally just gave me 50 euro‚Äôs for nothing. He just wanted me to have a good time and be able to buy food and pay for the fees at the border the next day. The hospitality of some of these people truly boggles the mind.

The border with Jordan was rather easy, if expensive. One Jordanian Dinar is about 1 euro 50, and it cost a small fortune to cross: visa (40JD), motorcycle (20JD), motorcycle insurance (36JD), SIM card (14JD). In Jordan I went down the length of the country towards Wadi Rum that same day, on highway 5 through the (Jordanian) Eastern Desert. Like KSA this part of the country was extremely sparsely populated, but at one point I randomly came across two dozen bikes parked on the side of the road and a bunch of guys having lunch. Turned out to be the Amman Motorcycle Club on their weekly tour. They even had a follow car with fuel, water, and a trailer for emergencies. As soon as I stopped I was swarmed by these [jovial guys](https://i.imgur.com/SnYUgpX.jpg) and they immediately handed me some water and snickers bars. We spent some time chatting and eating before going our separate ways. 

Jordan is the second recommendation I'd like to make. The country is small, the parts worth visiting are relatively close together. [Wadi Rum](https://i.imgur.com/CXC89O9.jpg) and [Petra](https://i.imgur.com/Rg4TVlj.jpg) have long been famous and they are worth every second and every penny. It is truly a wonderful, elating feeling to [ride around the desert](https://i.imgur.com/LDDIM4b.jpg) [between the colossal red mesa-like rocks](https://i.imgur.com/aVKe8Tg.jpg) in all sorts of fascinating shapes at Wadi Rum. Petra instead is human made, ‚Äòthe rose-colored city half as old as time itself‚Äô. Already famous in Roman times its location was ‚Äòlost‚Äô for a bit until being rediscovered last century. An entire city worth of buildings, caves, dwellings, [temples](https://i.imgur.com/feeWyot.jpg) carved out of red sandstone, with a fascinating water management system and a huge amphitheater to top it off. From Petra on I rode north following the Dead Sea. The roads across the central Jordanian mountain range were very pretty and [very quiet](https://i.imgur.com/kTLeOqz.jpg). Further north there were lots of kitschy shops selling Dead Sea sand, mud, face masks, all that jazz. Closer to Amman there suddenly was a lot of traffic, and the city itself is massive and sprawling, there‚Äôs not a lot of high rise so with 4 million people it covers a mind-boggling area. I spent a few days there and around Jerash. Amman has loads of interesting sights as well as a pretty decent street and night life, I went to see the Jordan Museum which had some really nice exhibitions and [historical artifacts](https://i.imgur.com/27s8IrM.jpg), the original [Hejaz railway station](https://i.imgur.com/Xpp4EFK.jpg), as well as the Citadel which offers great views of the city center. Jerash has a huge archaeological park with a well preserved [Roman street](https://i.imgur.com/31LjZHW.jpg), and the surrounding hills are dotted with villages and olive orchards. Riding around this part of Jordan isn‚Äôt super interesting in an of itself, it was fairly wet and cold while I was there and the roads are super busy.",2,1757699994.0,EUbikers,2,1.0,False
1nfa5dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBikeReviews/comments/1nfa5dc/explore_jasion_yc1_st_electric_bike_review_is_it/,Explore Jasion YC1 ST Electric Bike Review Is It Worth the Hype?,"**Detailed Review: Jasion YC1/ST Electric Bike for Adults**

Testing out the Jasion YC1/ST Electric Bike has been an adventure. As someone who commutes daily and also loves exploring outdoor trails, I couldn't resist the allure of this electric bike. With a robust 750W peak motor, sleek design, and multiple riding modes, it seemed like the perfect hybrid bike for all my needs. However, while it impressed me in many ways, there are certainly aspects to consider before making it your next purchase.

**Design and Build Quality**

The look of this bike immediately caught my attention. Its light green, elegant finish, combined with high-carbon steel frame material, gives it a sturdy yet appealing aesthetic. Assembly was straightforward, which earned some extra brownie points in my book. The frame feels solid and durable, capable of enduring demanding rides without any worries about structural wear and tear. While the 26-inch aluminum wheels aren't designed for hardcore mountain biking, they glide insanely well on paved roads and moderate trails. This bike also boasts an adjustable seat, which my significant other appreciated when she borrowed it for a spin.

**Power and Performance**

What really sets this ebike apart is the 360Wh battery paired with the 750W peak brushless motor. This combination delivers speeds up to 23 mph and a range of up to 40 miles in pedal-assist mode. One morning, I dared to test the limits, riding purely on this bike's ‚Äúpedal assist‚Äù mode during a long commute, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Admittedly, I‚Äôm not the lightest rider, so I found the 330 lbs max load capacity extremely reassuring. Charging wasn't a hassle either; with two fast-charging options, I was able to get it to full power in just under six hours. My coworker may or may not have been annoyed when I unplugged the office coffee machine to test the removable battery feature, but it works great for easy home or office charging.  

[Ready to buy Jasion YC1/ST? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://expertbiking.com/p/b0dtty2k5k/)

**Flexibility and Riding Modes**

I loved diving into the 3+1 riding modes. Whether I wanted an effortless ride using the pure electric mode or an intense workout with manual pedaling, this bike had me covered. On certain stretches of city riding, I found myself toggling between modes effortlessly, depending on the traffic and terrain. The walking mode came in handy too, especially when I had to push the bike through crowded sidewalks. It feels like this bike wants you to tailor the journey to your mood‚Äîbe it a laid-back ride or an ambitious trek.

**Key Benefits**

- Bright LED headlights and reflective strips enhance safety for nighttime rides.
- The dual disc brakes offer instantaneous stopping power that feels responsive and reliable.
- Multi-function LCD display easily tracks your speed, battery level, and journey metrics.
- Lockable front suspension absorbs shocks from rough paths.
- The 7-speed transmission system makes tackling hills and varying terrains seamless.

**Areas for Improvement**

- At higher speeds, the electric motor can get a bit noisy, which might disturb those craving a quieter experience.
- The removable battery design, while convenient, doesn‚Äôt lock securely in place, which makes me cautiously paranoid around theft-prone areas.
- While the larger tires are great, they don't have advanced tread, so gripping rugged trails isn‚Äôt the best.
- The seat, despite being adjustable, felt rigid for longer rides‚Äîmy solution? Invest in a gel seat cover.

**Market Rivals**

Comparing this bike to some others in its price range, like the Rad Power Bikes RadCity 5 or Aventon Level, there‚Äôs a surprising level of competitiveness here. The Jasion YC1/ST stands out with its ease of maneuverability and appealing safety features like dual-disc brakes and reflective accents. However, rivals like Aventon Level offer slightly better shock absorption and frame geometry suited for dirt trails. RadCity, on the other hand, outdoes Jasion in terms of motor quietness and cargo mounting options. For urban commuting, this ebike holds its ground powerfully, but for pure adventure-seekers, competitors may present sharper features.

**Price Worthiness**

In the realm of electric bikes, you usually get what you pay for, but this ride feels like a lot of bang for the buck. Its mid-range pricing puts it in that sweet spot where features meet affordability. Many competitors offering similar specs tend to nudge a bit higher in cost without diverging much in performance. If commuting and light off-road ventures are your jam, it strikes a balance that many riders may appreciate.

My department is very small, and everyone else has been here for years. They‚Äôre all really close and hang out outside of work, so it feels like I‚Äôve walked into a group of old friends where I don‚Äôt really belong.

I know it‚Äôs not always smart to get too close to coworkers since personal information can sometimes be used against you, but honestly, I‚Äôm feeling really lonely. I want to build relationships that feel genuine, not just for the sake of having someone to talk to, but because I care about growing in my career. Eventually, I‚Äôd like to move into another department, and I know that without building some kind of network, I might miss those opportunities entirely.

One of the hardest parts has been lunch. The team always goes out together, but they never invite me. I‚Äôve asked a few times if I could join, and they always say yes, but when I sit with them, I feel invisible. They don‚Äôt include me in conversations or ask me any questions. I try to engage by asking them things and showing interest, but they usually give short answers that end the conversation. After a while, I stopped going because it felt worse to sit there and be ignored than it did to eat alone.

I‚Äôve tried other ways to connect, like offering to grab coffee for people when I go on breaks or starting casual conversations during downtime, but those attempts also tend to fall flat. I know I shouldn‚Äôt care too much about what they think, but it‚Äôs hard. This is my first real job, and I want to build a strong foundation. I feel like being in an entry-level admin role makes me easy to overlook, even though I know I have a lot of potential. It‚Äôs hard watching new hires in upper management be instantly welcomed and pulled into the group while I‚Äôm barely acknowledged.

I‚Äôve been trying to take initiative in small ways. I ask about people‚Äôs roles, express interest in learning, and have even reached out to see if anyone is open to a quick coffee chat so I can understand more about the company. Most of the time, I get told people are too busy, and then I see them socializing with each other anyway.

I know I‚Äôm still very new and that building real connections takes time. I don‚Äôt expect to be part of the inner circle right away. But I‚Äôm struggling with how to approach this in a way that feels genuine and intentional. I want to position myself with smart career moves, but I don‚Äôt know how or what small steps to take next. I feel awkward a lot of the time, and I‚Äôm scared that if I don‚Äôt figure this out soon, I‚Äôll miss the window to grow and be seen.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you build real connections without forcing it or coming off as desperate? And how did you take early steps to grow your career when you didn‚Äôt feel supported or included?",2,1757699864.0,work,0,1.0,False

I've been riding for more than a decade but my gf, let's call her J., only got her license last year, and two days later we departed for a tour of the Alps. We ended up riding about 4000km through Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and France. Gorgeous, but also well-traveled and well-known territory. 

For this year we wanted to do something a bit more adventurous, and after a lot of deliberation and staring at maps we decided on Crete, because neither of us had been to the Balkans yet, and we wanted to see more of Greece and Italy. We planned, roughly, for 9000km in 5 weeks.

## **Preparations**
***

***Bikes and luggage***

J. really likes the Tiger, and I'd just bought a new SMT in January. When it came to luggage I had a number of bags lying around from my previous trips, and decided to expand the set with a Kriega rackpack. The completed setup was as follows:

* Tiger: 42L top case, 30L Kriega drypack, 10L tank bag. Chain lock wrapped around the rear carrier.
* SMT: Kriega 40L rackpack, Kriega 30L drypack, 5L tank bag. Disc lock in the seat pocket.

The two locks allowed us to quickly [secure the bikes](https://imgur.com/a/KbxDPW7) and helmets anywhere we went. Both bikes also had a bottle holder with a thermos for (cold) drinking water attached to the front crash bars. For each bag we carried a spare strap, as well as some general purpose rokstraps and bungee cords. You never know when something might break, or when stuff falls off and you need to secure it somehow.

We each have a full mesh gear setup: jacket, pants, gloves, and riding sneakers topped off with fitted ear plugs, a buff, and Sena helmet kit. Both of us also carried a light rainjacket, waterproof riding overall, hiking boots, regular light shoes, a sweater, and some light regular clothing. In the tank bag we carried a tourniquet, emergency bandage, pocket knife, lighter, drinking water, some emergency food (energy bars), phone and charger, and miscellaneous stuff like sunglasses, camera, and paper maps. We also had two small first aid kits, a foil blanket, and some regular towels with us.

***Maintenance, spare parts, tools***

The Tiger was sitting at around 230k km and has been burning oil at an accelerating pace. It needs topping up every few days, so we decided to play it safe, and brought a 4L oil can with us, as well as some small spare parts (starter solenoid, sprocket nut and lockwasher). The SMT was brand new with only 9k on it, the main concern being that the 15k service should be done somewhere on the way for warranty purposes. For chain maintenance I carried a 1L bottle of 80w90 gear oil and a brush. We also had [a small toolkit](https://imgur.com/a/0psTdqg) with the basics required to work on the brakes, bodywork, get to the battery and fuses, and make emergency repairs (tape/tiewraps/wire). Both of us have worldwide roadside assistance, and since we weren't planning on straying too far from civilization we didn't carry camping or cooking gear, nor equipment to change tires. While on the road we would grease the chains and give the bikes a good lookover every few days at least.

***Navigation and lodging***

Both bikes have Garmin XTs mounted, and for each day we'd make a GPX in Kurviger and upload it to the navis. We had a general route in mind but the details were usually worked out over dinner the night before with some old-fashioned paper maps and some local information sprinkled in. Apart from the first and the last day we mostly avoided motorways, and on average did about 300km a day. We'd typically ride for 60 - 90 minutes each between breakfast, coffee, lunch, and afternoon drinks, and arrival so about 4 - 6 hours of riding each day. 

When it came to lodging we went with BnB's, apartments, and hotels found through the usual channels. I have done some light camping in the past but never on longer motorcycle trips and never with J., so if we ever wanted to, we'd have to do some practice runs first. We didn't have a strict budget per se, but tried to stay within about ‚Ç¨250 a day on average, including two tanks of fuel.

## **Leg 1: [Netherlands to Macedonia](https://imgur.com/a/EUMKvRV)**
***

* Day 1 and 2: Freiburg, Germany (700km)

We left around 11h00 for an _autobahn_ sit to Freiburg, arriving for dinner with friends of mine who live near the city. I know there's a lot to see in-between: the Ardennes, Luxemburg, the Black Forest, the Vosges.. but we've been to those places many, many times already and when you're on the way south it's preferable to take long strides sometimes. We suffered through heavy rainstorms near Frankfurt but by the time we pulled off the highway two hours later it was warm and dry. The next day we took a bit of a rest and explored the city together with my mates. Freiburg is a large university town with a young vibe and a lovely mix of provincial and cosmopolitan Germany. Worth a stop, if you're ever nearby. 

* Day 3: Lech, Austria (350km)

We took off through the southernmost part of the Black Forest to arrive on the shores of the Bodensee (Lac Konstanz) for a sun-drenched lunch. I'd plotted a route from Bregenz along the [200] and [198] in Tyrol cause I'd never been to that part of Austria yet, and it was pretty decent and a bit quiet. We got some light rain in the afternoon, but generally decent weather. Out hotel for the night was a very cheap but run down classic mountain lodge, with rooms that have been in dire need of an overhaul since about 1995. It seemed to me like the family who owned it was squeezing it for what it was worth without investing anything in the place. [Dinner](https://imgur.com/a/bHbaEXV) and breakfast were decent however, but the wifi and cell reception was nonexistent in the little valley.

* Day 4: Tolmezzo, Italy (350km)

We left in the morning fog towards Imst, a road with great views of the southern Alps across the valley, towards Italy. We took a short bit of highway to get past Innsbruck, then turned south and east to Zell am Ziller and the [Grossglockner](https://imgur.com/a/bVcSklw). I've mostly been to the Swiss and Italian side of the Alps so this famous road was on the to-do list still. We arrived on a weekday just after lunch which meant it was fairly quiet, but I can imagine it being busy and annoying on weekends. The road is great but the toll is outrageous: ‚Ç¨35 per bike. It's worth it, at least for once, because the views and landscape are absolutely stunning. The road was built as a tourist attraction starting in 1930 as it didn't exist as a historical pass or anything, hence the tolls. Once across the GG we went southeast to the beautiful little [Plockenpass into Italy](https://imgur.com/a/YeZ9eFv), and arrived at [our BnB near Tolmezzo](https://imgur.com/a/QdwomvD). From here on the weather was pretty much impeccable for the rest of our trip.

* Day 5: Obrov, Slovenia (350km)

We started with a quiet mountain outing in the morning, towards Paularo and then north over an eerily quiet and narrow road towards the (unpaved) Polentin pass. We didn't take it though, instead continuing east to Pontebba, and then up the Sella Nevea and Predil passes into Slovenia. We followed the [203] and [102] south along the river through countless villages with traffic cameras seemingly every 500 meters. The temperature also built steadily and in the afternoon we were buckling in the 35 degree heat. Took a break near the [Skjocjan Caves](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xMC2N6PriYnVSjrb7) where the Karst landscape has been worn out by rainfall and underground rivers into endless tunnels which at some point collapsed leaving a [giant crater](https://imgur.com/a/g29pmdj) in the landscape, a bizarre and gorgeous sight, but also quiet at this time of day and cool in the forest. We found a gorgeous BnB in the [hills east of Trieste](https://imgur.com/a/A7Dt59x) which included a lovely dinner with local wines, and breakfast.

* Day 6: Bihac, Bosnia and Herzegovina (400km)

This turned out to be one of the more interesting days, cause a lot happened in quick succession. We approached the Adriatic over some beautiful B roads to enjoy morning coffee at the [little boulevard in Bakar](https://imgur.com/a/Uu2Z16G), next to Rijeka. After this we followed the coast, zooming between campers and caravans, with gorgeous views of the sea and numerous islands to our right. At our lunch stop in Senj we were approached by a Dutch couple who just returned from a MotoGymKhana tournament in Zagreb so we spent some time talking bikes with them, and afterwards we went up into the hills towards Dabar and eventualle Zeljava. We saw several 'warning: mines' signs on the side of the road, and in one little village where we stopped for drinks we were greeted by the local car tuning club, bunch of guys with old Audi's and VW's, ogling J., who didn't feel quite at ease. I noticed that several of them had Ustase stickers on their cars (local version of the SS, basically), lovely bunch. Croatia apparently has a bit of a problem with far right extremists. We got the hell outta there as soon as our colas were through. This part of Croatia felt very remote and rough, and although there were plenty of signs advertising apartments and BnB's, there was hardly anyone on the road. Not long after this we arrived at [Zeljava air base](https://imgur.com/a/2USAZA0) which is fairly well known at this point and a nice opportunity for a cheesy picture. [The border with Bosnia](https://imgur.com/a/AdpKuV1) was only a few miles away and was very easy: no inspections, no questions, just a quick glance at our passports and that was it. Immediately afterwards the landscape changed, with occasional [mosques](https://imgur.com/a/QVjhrCU) and orthodox christian churches in the little villages next to the road, old tractors chugging along with carts full of produce, and children playing in the street. One of the staff of our motel in Bihac explained that it was peaceful now, Muslims, Christians, and everyone tolerating each other pretty much. We noticed how the mosque in town _did_ call for prayer like usual but in a rather quiet and short version unlike the minute-long yammering you get in the Middle East, and plenty of restaurants served alcohol. The crowd in the street also seemed varied, could've been anyplace Europe, basically. The town itself was situated along a shallow river with a fairground, restaurants, and bars and loads of people and kids around, it felt very organic and friendly. We had great burgers at a 'wine bar' which turned out to have exactly two kinds of wine, red and white.

* Day 7 and 8: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (300km)

Breakfast was intense: we got eggs, a bunch of baked or steamed vegetables, and no less than three different kinds of sausages as well as bacon and olives, and no coffee (which was off because [Bosnian coffee](https://imgur.com/a/wBJiDYF) in general is quite good). By god did I wish for an espresso and some croissants! We followed the main road along the river all day towards Sarajevo, and saw several more signs indicating mines as well as remnants from the war: numerous buildings, large and small, had bullet holes and even [grenade impacts](https://imgur.com/a/i4z3pxD), which had either been left in place or re-stucced in a different colour for emphasis. Gasoline was only about 1‚Ç¨ per liter which made for easy fueling, and all but the smallest places accepted card payments. We stopped for lunch in Jajce with its [gorgeous waterfalls](https://imgur.com/a/Jo0XbnO), situated among green rolling hills. The roads were generally good and traffic was light. It was quite hot in the afternoon so around Zenica we decided to take the highway for the last hour towards Sarajevo.

The next day we visited one of the [museums](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2JVpHjsi9jetyixZ7) about the siege which was.. a haunting experience. It's truly despicable how the international community sat by and watched while civilians were being starved and shot at daily for nearly four years. We walked around town a good bit and came across numerous monuments and memorials. In the afternoon we took the cable car up to Trebevic hill which gave a great [view of the city](https://imgur.com/a/QIIsjEn) and is the location of the [abandoned bobsled track](https://imgur.com/a/R9kgsk5) from the [1984 winter olympics](https://imgur.com/a/2xMBZj4). Like the rest of Bosnia, Sarajevo was in a reasonably good state and it felt clean, and modern. The old town is extremely touristy with all the garbage trinket shops, ice cream vendors, and tourist traps this brings, but at the same time it maintains a quaint and interesting atmosphere. 

* Day 9: Berane, Montenegro (300km)

About an hour east of Sarajevo we were taking a little roadside break, when suddenly a fluffy little shape walks across the road not 20ft away. I whisper to J. in my mic.. ""_there's a bear cub here, get back on the bike quick and quiet cause we need to go now_"". Really didn't feel like meeting his mom! The [R450] and [R467] feel quiet and remote, and run by some very pretty rocky canyons and little lakes. We crossed into Serbia later morning, just for a short stint cause the [182] goes nowhere except south into Montenegro. Both crossings were extremely quiet and easy without questions or hassle. The [P10] and [E65] south lead through some pretty landscapes, flowing green hills and mountains very much like the past few days, except it had been _desurfaced_ for a distance of nearly 20 miles in anticipation of major repairs/upgrades, so we spent almost an hour driving dead slow along rocky white gravel in a filthy dusty mist thrown up by the cars in front of us. My snot was like clay for hours after this and the bikes looked like they'd been through a [cement](https://imgur.com/a/RXnJg6r) [mixer](https://imgur.com/a/A0iF9OK).

* Day 10: Givgelija, Macedonia (400km)

Our hostel was situated on the ski slopes with a [magnificent breakfast view](https://imgur.com/a/w4JkU1U), after which we took the steep hairpins back down to the main road. We entered Kosovo half an hour later, the border crossing was busier than the others we'd had so far but not much of a hassle. We had to buy temporary insurance worth ‚Ç¨6 per bike since Kosovo is de facto independent from Serbia but not formally recognised by the European insurance companies yet. The [R106] down from the Montegrin mountains onto the Kosovo plain was spectacular with great tarmac, beautiful hairpins, and a sweet view. The central plain south of Pristina was extremely boring and busy and it was crazy hot as well, so we only dipped into the capital briefly for a glance at the Bill Clinton [statue](https://imgur.com/a/O4w0qTJ) (they're grateful to NATO in general and ol' Bill specifically for the 1999 intervention which eventually resulted in their independence) before heading south towards Macedonia. The combination of scorching heat and ferry ticket prices (to Crete) meant that we had to make a bit of speed these days. Highways aren't nearly always boring though, the [E75] southeast of Skopje weaves and bends through a beautiful rocky landscape with the occasional olive grove and winery. It was nice to be able to keep up the speed in the scorching heat. Our place for tonight was the quite luxurious but also very cheap Sky Hotel barely a mile north of the Greek border. We sat on the roof terrace in the still-heavy evening heat enjoying a beer and chatting with the waiter who spoke perfect English and recommended some local dishes to us. One of them seemed a bit like lasagna (oven dish with layers of vegetables, tomatoes, and cheese) however upon my comparison the guy was adamant that I was an idiot and that it was in fact not at all like lasagna.

## **Leg 2: [Greece](https://imgur.com/a/7xJ0zpt)**
***

* Day 11: Kalambaka, Greece (300km)

For most of our time in [Greece](https://imgur.com/a/0fJOzBl) the mid-day temperatures were around 35 degrees and we were stopping every 30-45mins for a drink, and if possible to dunk our buff and gloves in water somewhere which would make the next 30 mins on the bike bearable. This morning we followed the main road south to Thesaloniki and then Katerini, where we turned right into the hills, along the foot of [mount olympos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aGR3VAEcjhqrov846). The inner part of Greece isn't as touristy as the coast and some of the cities, so the roads were fairly quiet, first the [13] and then the [26] and [15] to Kalambaka and [the Meteora](https://imgur.com/a/nnliiNQ). We were absolutely soaking with sweat when we arrived, however the view is.. off this world. I can only imagine the reactions of the first stone-age Greeks as they ventured inland and came across [this landscape](https://imgur.com/a/aZXrn2k) which appears [straight out of a high fantasy series](https://imgur.com/a/hq1yRby). We took a long cold shower then went for a (slow!) walk [around the foot of these hills](https://imgur.com/a/OfmyFEX) (this is funny because I'm a biologist and the sign says MICROBIOLOGIKO) in the evening heat, we'd planned on going a longer circuit but the heat made it impossible. 

* Day 12: Piraeus (350km)

We left very early in the morning to try and beat the some of the worst heat, speeding along the [E65] towards Lamia along a valley which was [a good bit greener](https://imgur.com/a/rxcfHQr) than the rest of Greece, probably due to rain runoff from the surrounding mountains. Giant olive/orange/lime orchards were all over the place and the road was flanked by ancient rock quarries and a snaking railway that seemed rather newly built. Once up in the hills south of Lamia the temperature dropped somewhat and we got to take a number of [remote little roads](https://imgur.com/a/6sJlzDQ)(not pictured: 42 degrees celsius!) full of hairpins which ran straight through villages with very surprised looking old Greek men on the road side. We had a long [lunch and a swim in Antikyra](https://imgur.com/a/t4b6gv7), and around 15h00 we wetted our gear once again to brace against the stifling heat on the road to Athens. We had planned for a curvy coastal road but we were so tired and fed up with the heat that we decided to stick to the main roads and even took a bit of highway. Interesting to note is that the Greek toll system is very different from the French/Spanish/Italian ones, in the sense that you don't take a ticket and pay when you leave the road, but you just stop at a toll station every 10-20km on the road and pay directly for that distance. Oftentimes it was no more than 50 cents, occasionally 1 or 2 euro's. 

Athens and the surroundings suffer from a terrible case of urban heat syndrome and evening traffic made it all the worse, it was close to 40 degrees on the main road into Piraeus. We were splitting at a decent pace between the commuters but still local bikes and scooters zoomed around us every which way.

* Day 13 and 14: Matala (100km)

We boarded the ferry [Piraeus -> Heraklion](https://imgur.com/a/tZ4ERL7) around 08h30 with a large backpack full of groceries: water, bread, olives, snacks, some fruit, etc. The onboard offerings are usually overpriced medium quality so it's best to bring your own. We picked a nice spot in the shade on the rear deck and spent the day gazing our over the mediterranean, reading, or sipping coffee (the only thing worth buying from the bar, basically). At one point I though I saw some dolphins in the distance but was unable to verify :(

Crete is a little cooler than the mainland which felt like a welcome change, and the ride south across the island to [Matala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matala,_Crete) was uneventful. We found a nice little guest house with airconditioning and a good place to park, so all was well. We took a rest the next day, went [hiking](https://imgur.com/a/RlxikkH), swimming, enjoyed a long seaside lunch followed by a siesta, and sauntered along the little town which while rather touristy on the hand, was also small enough to maintain a distinct aura of local innocence on the other. There's a cute little harbour with a small beach and beautiful [rock formations](https://imgur.com/a/Dgdoc9p) right next to it, [hippie graffiti and art](https://img1.vakantio.de/uploads/f83fb11285e4535ba04c81438f9a2a7d_large.avif), as well as a lot of small bars and restaurants. Not a bad place for a break!

* Day 15 and 16: Rethymno (350km)

We rode along the rocky coastal road westwards towards Selia and Komitades, and then north and slightly easy back to Rethymno. The mountains sometimes seem to rise straight from the sea! We passed through [several](https://imgur.com/a/J2PUouS) [rocky gorges](https://imgur.com/a/3a9kxWQ) where all life had gone grey and yellow except right next to what used to be the stream. Even insects were few and far between since it hadn't rained in over a month with consistent 30-degree temperatures. The southern coast is rather quiet with only the occasional tour bus going to the gorges, on the other hand the northern coast is extremely touristy and rather bland. Endless hotels, resorts, restaurants and a huge traffic jam all the way in between. Rethymno itself has a decent boulevard and harbour but the town itself is inundated with tourists and it's difficult to find affordable and authentic places to eat and shop. It's basically the same souvenir store with fridge magnets, coffee cups, and dresses copy-pasted a few hundred times. 

We took a bit of a rest day after this, J. was a bit tired so she hopped on the back of the SMT and we drove a bit west to see the [ruins of Aptera](https://imgur.com/a/BtdR5As) and then went for lunch + a swim in the town of Stavros just north of Chania. Turned out to have been the exact beach location used in the movie [Zorba the Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorba_the_Greek_\(film\)). 

* Day 17: Heraklion (100km)

We left early in the morning because I had an appointment with the KTM garage in Heraklion - it was sitting at nearly 14.000km and the 15k service was near. Napels might also have been an option but that might have been stretching it. Any way we arrived at the shop around 10h00 to find all the lifts occupied and nobody in a rush to help despite the appointment. We had to wait a good half hour before the lead mechanic was finished and told us it'd take at least two hours for the oil change and minor checks, so we spent the rest of the morning and lunch at a nearby caf√© under the blissful air conditiong. We had planned to go for a longer ride in the afternoon towards Arkalohchori but the long wait and the stifling heat killed the mood, so we went for an early check in at our hotel, spending the rest of the afternoon and evening strolling around town, visiting museums and writing postcards. The [Heraklion Archaological Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ficYA6SQZFYV2udB8) was sweet, they had [so much stuff](https://imgur.com/a/3fwLREq) that they could easily split into five different museums each with a proper collection!

* Day 18: Nafplion (200km)

The return [ferry to Piraeus](https://imgur.com/a/BQbSMtZ) left at 09h00 and we were well-prepared again with our bag of groceries. In retrospect it would've been preferable to stay a few more days on Crete considering the costs of the ferry (‚Ç¨120 for a one-way for two pax and two bikes), and I wouldn't have minded spending another day or two in Matala and having another day for a bike trip either to the eastern or western point of the island. But we had a wee bit of a schedule to keep and were also dependent on the Igoumenitsa - Brindisi ferry which was far more expensive and this required careful planning.

It was hot again in Piraeus late afternoon, so we quickly jumped on the bikes and made our way across the Isthmus of Corinth towards Nafplion in the peloponnese. A gorgeous old town with a touristy aftertaste, Nafplion has been an important harbour since Roman times, with several large fortresses either [in the harbour](https://imgur.com/a/tqqWHGm) or [on the hills](https://imgur.com/a/aQFQjTF) right behind it.

* Day 19: Vonitsa (350km)

From Nafplion we drove around the bay to Lerna and then west into the hills of the Arcadia, already famous in ancient times for its 'untouched' landscape. We followed the [7], [111] and the [33] west, then turned north near Agria Triade, towards Patras. It was at this point that the rear hugger of the Tiger broke and started rattling like crazy. We got lucky at one of the gas stations when the clerk had [a drill I could borrow](https://imgur.com/a/rbKit10), and I fixed it with a nice [tiewrap stitch](https://imgur.com/a/DUOX0wB). It was also during this day that J. cried out in pain at some point, when a hornet the size of a fist took a bite out of her leg, right through her mesh suit. Even three weeks later the damn wound hasn't healed completely. It doesn't sound like much but this was one of my favorite days in Greece since it was quiet, green, not _too_ hot in the mountains, and just hours and hours of endless curves and pretty landscapes. From Patras we went north to the little peninsula of Aitoliko which is an extremely run-down town which to be honest should have been a tourist hotspot, considering the location on the coast, and the views.

## **Leg 3: [Italy and back home](https://imgur.com/a/4IfzBCs)**
***

* Day 20: Brindisi, Italy (150km)

Our [ferry to Italy](https://imgur.com/a/SAti71g) left at 14h00 only, so we took a slow morning with breakfast along the shores of the Ambracian gulf, near the location where in 31 BCE Octavian (the later emperor Caesar Augustus) with a little help from Marcus Agrippa [defeated the forces of Marc Antony and Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium), effectively becoming sole ruler of the mediterranean and shaping Europe for the ages. From there we took the sweet coastal road past Lichnos and Sivota and arrived in Igoumenitsa in time for some lunch and grocery shopping. The ferry itself was uneventful and our hostel for the night was a rundown place so I won't waste time on that.

* Day 21 and 22: Sorrento (450km)

We left at 07h00 and made our way along the [E90] to Taranto for breakfast. This part of Apulia is flat with mainly agriculture and a lot of abandoned and ruined farmhouses and industry. Even the roadside is filthy with trash dumped everywhere. After a sweet Italian breakfast and some cappuchinos with a view of the Taranto harbour, we continued north-west into the hills along the [E847], [SP103] and [SS92], coming by some some pretty historical villages (and ruins) such as Pisticci, [Craco](https://imgur.com/a/nIPOew8), and Stigliano. Once near Potenza it was getting awfully hot again so from here on we stuck to the main roads before arriving at the stunning [Amalfi coast](https://imgur.com/a/ciBQWU6) near Salerno. If you're ever in the neighbourhood, go here, rent a bike, and drive the [SS163] here!

The next day we drove down to the Sorrento harbour in [the local biker outfit](https://imgur.com/a/czTDXNu), and took the ferry into Napoli harbour and played tourist for a bit, before taking the train back in the evening. We had real nice BnB on a hill near Vico Equense which offered [sweet views of Napoli bay and the Visuvius](https://imgur.com/a/pzEu5FT)!

* Day 23: Cassino (300km)

We followed the coast towards Pompeii then took a number of quiet mountain roads (which I can't find on the map for the life of me) towards Avellino and Benevento. From there we stuck to the hills all the way towards Piedimonte, Pietrovairano with it's beautiful (and only very recently discovered) [Roman theatre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/imfMfi2Rqo1PftUc8), and eventually Cassino where drove up all the way to [the abbey](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zNfdCF5skY5B63dh6) for a stroll. The abbey was completely destroyed by the USAF in 1944 (along with several hundred refugees sheltering) because intel indicated that the Germans were using it as an observation post (which was false). Look up [the battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino) if you're even remotely interested in history!

* Day 24: Trasimene (350km)

From Cassino we headed to the coast near Latina to circumvent Rome as much as possible (already been there - not keen on traffic!) and had coffee on the beach near the Fiumichino airport. From there we followed the coast all the way to Tarquinia where we turned right towards Viterbo, the ancient [Papal residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Popes_in_Viterbo), then continued inland along the highway towards lake Trasimene, the location of [the second of Hannibals' stunning victories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Trasimene) against the Romans during the second Punic war. The landscape in this part of Italy is green rolling hills, much unlike the dry near-desert of the south. We found an [old-fashioned but affordable](https://imgur.com/a/BtChvyA) and friendly hotel a little ways away from the lake shore.

* Day 25 and 26: Cinque Terre (350km)

From Trasimene we crossed Tuscany towards Siena en Pontedera, a hypertouristic region but also well deserved. The landscape is a characteristic greenish/brown dotted with cypress-lined country lanes, orchards and vineyards, and the architecture is [extremely picturesque](https://iconiclife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tuscany-Italy-countryside.jpg). We went by the iconic [Gladiator filming location](https://imgur.com/a/BEfa0u6) and definitely weren't the only one in line. Foreign license plates are everywhere and traffic in the bigger towns is super busy. There's also wine-tastings advertised every couple miles at least so being on the road here in the late afternoon carries a bit of risk no doubt. Lastly we took a wee bit of highway to La Spezia since it was, again, stupid hot, and once there turned onto the hills just behind Cinque Terre to reach Manarola, our stay for tonight. CT is one of the most touristic places in Italy ([and well-deserved tbh](https://imgur.com/a/CJP7UUv)), and the most iconic five towns are difficult to reach by vehicle, we had to [park nearly a mile outside the little town along the road](https://imgur.com/a/fuLzsrl) and carry our luggage all the way. We managed to find an affordable BnB with a _great_ breakfast for just over ‚Ç¨100 a night; most other places were more than twice as expensive.

The day after we took a nice lazy rest, went swimming in the [little rocky harbour](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bbcf00a9b8fe874ed2f03d0/75b3da41-f663-4d86-9225-4c1bba64f00e/cinque-terre-manarola.jpg?format=2500w), took the train to nearby [Vernazza](https://imgur.com/a/x51YTg6) (absolute _packed_ with tourists: American, Chinese, German mostly it seemed), had an expensive but lovely lunch, and then boated back to Manarola. CT is expensive in the main season but [the coast is stunning](https://imgur.com/a/BwzCJ7X) so if you're ever around and can find a decently-priced place to stay (or simply visit slightly in the off-season..).

* Day 27: Milan (250km)

From Cinque Terre we followed the coast north-west and then slightly inland to Rivarola, from which we took the [SS586], [SP586R] and the [SS45] north-east to Piacenza. The whole region consists of low, [forested mountains](https://imgur.com/a/ly15ci7) and in-between the villages it feels eerily quiet. We met a handful of Italian biker groups and near Marsaglia came across an accident site where a Street Fighter V4 had struck the front end of an oncoming car. The bike was wrecked and the rider was in obvious distress on the road side, his mates however appeared to have things under control and when we continued along we met the ambulance racing to the scene, coming the other way. When we descended towards the Po valley in the early afternoon the temperature shot up to the high thirties, and the Trebbia river which the road followed roughly north was dotted with parasols and playing children. Just south of Piacenza we visited the [battle memorial](https://imgur.com/a/8wPGRXq) near the location where Hannibal inflicted [the first of his three defeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trebia) against the Romans in 218 BCE. Although clearly marked on the map, the memorial doesn't have a dedicated place to park nor even a plaque or sign explaining what it is. From Piacenza we took the highway to Milan - J. was tired after all the mountain roads and by the extreme heat we faced in the afternoon. Milan was a bit of a surprise in mid-August, we found the city more or less abandoned with barely any traffic in the streets and much of the shops and restaurants closed. We spent the evening with friends, wandering around the 'new' part of town ([Piazza Gau Alente](https://imgur.com/a/pDIf9OC) and surroundings) and the ['tree library'](https://imgur.com/a/asCFhiO) next to it (which is really well done), after which we had an elaborate yet bargain dinner in [a tiny Chinese restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zFT87vWYaqZYtfNN7).

* Day 28,29,30: Davos, Switzerland (800km)

From Milan we rode north to Como, then followed the Swiss [2] and [13] along the valley to Bellinzona and eventually [San Bernardino](https://imgur.com/a/FkSe3sV). It's one of my favorite passes, too narrow for trucks and with a [gorgeous lake](https://imgur.com/a/mMCfKbm) at the top, and even the last stretch of the highway towards it has [bloody hairpins](https://imgur.com/a/POJxDWx)! From here we went along the beautiful Graub√ºndner valleys towards Thusis and eventually Davos. I've been coming to Davos regularly for more than a decade and the high season (winter) prices are legendary, however in late summer everything is decidedly more affordable; we managed to snatch a room in a fancy, old fashioned three-star hotel for just 400 francs for three nights. We had a [gorgeous mountain view](https://imgur.com/a/5aRFAn0) [from our balcony](https://imgur.com/a/Y30ghVG) and breakfast was everything you'd expect from a fancy place! 

The next morning we took off early towards the Fluela, Ofen, Fuorn, [Stelvio](https://imgur.com/a/7F82fiR), [Bernina](https://imgur.com/a/Y51T6Dd), and Albula passes respectively ([clockwise from the top](https://imgur.com/a/HcVHAZs)). A long day of [well-trodden mountain territory for both of us](https://imgur.com/a/JjXiquq), but goddamn if [this](https://imgur.com/a/81VqzaX) isn't what riding is about, I don't know what is. Weather was perfect and J. did extremely well even on the heavy tiger. We even got to a cute [couple picture](https://imgur.com/a/Pjbu5oo) taken! ü•∞

On the second rest day we took it real easy with only a short tour of the [Julier](https://imgur.com/a/QuStcLn) and Fluela passes in the morning, and a short hike and a relaxing swim in the afternoon. It was 28 degrees in Davos which is considered somewhat of a heat wave aroun there.

* Day 31: Freiburg, Germany (300km)

From Davos we took a number of minor (and not always very interesting) roads northeast through Switzerland and the Black Forest past Liechtenstein, St. Gallen, and Waldshut, while stopping in Winterthur for lunch with friends. It was extremely hot once more, and the holiday traffic in the Black Forest was exhausting, bloody campervans everywhere. We were happy to crash with friends after a cold shower, and with a cold beer!

* Day 32: Home (700km)

Straight shot north-west on the Autobahn. No irregularities ;)

## **Epilogue**
***

We got home mid-August filthy and tired after [8300km](https://imgur.com/a/ON68EP3). We spent two days washing, cleaning, and sorting through everything, and on the third day we took the bikes to the [car wash](https://imgur.com/a/fxblwlW) for a good scrub. After that, it was time to return to normal life more or less.

The bikes held up fine, only issues were the sometimes nonfunctional cruise control on the SMT, and the broken rear hugger of the Tiger. The latter drank nearly 4.5L of oil, which is a bit frustrating but unsurprising considering its age. I'm curious to see whether it'll hold up another ~60k til 300 without a major breakdown. I'm also very impressed with the SMT. It's comfortable on longer distances, easy to pack with luggage, but at the same time also light and nimble, and an absolute riot in the mountains.

***Favorite roads:*** (in no particular order)

* [Unnamed road between Paularo and Pontebba in north-eastern Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/24768qrnwdibcr1M8). Narrow and curvy, the tarmac was nonexistent at times but the sweet and quiet alpine landscape and the looming peaks were stunning. Navigation will claim that the road is closed due to a landslide but this has been fixed recently. There's a lovely _[agroturismo](https://imgur.com/a/TWcwzEI)_ halfway for coffee and snacks, be sure to bring cash. You can also cross the unpaved Polentin pass into Austria from there.

* [The R467 in Bosnia between Pijesak and the Serbian border](https://maps.app.goo.gl/joRnQFxbVpc6vhwJ8). Gorgeous green hills interspersed with little lakes and rivers. Extremely quiet, and uhh, there's bears. The whole route felt dreamy.

* [The 111 in the Arcadia, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xhAtjT5vMdVMDfzK6). Endlessly long, very quiet, a mix of green and rocky, and decently surfaced with endless curves and spectacular views. Part of it feel like the Alps almost, with ski resorts and wooden lodges.

* [Unnamed coastal road south of Igoumenitsa, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BXybD55hn3GT9Pot9). Stunning views of the rocky coastline with small forested islands dotted about and Corfu looming in the distance. The hulking ferries chugging along on the horizon really put things into perspective.

* [The SS163 on the Amalfi coast, Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2RU3wuSnz8RKBnvg8). This road is a testament to man's arrogance. Endless tunnels, bridges, and little villages with not a level square meter of soil in sight. Do not attempt with a car.


***Personal notes***

Traveling like this with your partner certainly makes things more interesting, it's far more intense than just living together, because there's never a quiet moment: you're always on the road together, resting, eating, sleeping together. You can't bugger off to spend the evening with friends, you can't isolate yourself with games, a book, or garden work. In that sense it's a great relationship test, and the important part is to communicate about the frustrations that arise, because you'll both be going through them. We did fine overall, but there were certainly difficult days and occasions when I really just wanted to have some time to myself. At the same time you do get to know each other better through such circumstances, and I wouldn't trade that for the world.

If you're ever wondering if motorcycle touring is for you - let this tale be of inspiration? Start small, just a few days here and there, then work your way up. Onroad, offroad, camping, hotels, you can do it in whatever way works for you. Collect maps, bags, accessories, tools, and chase that horizon! It's an intense way to travel, but also one of the best to actually _see_ the places you're going through.

# Chapter VII:¬†Torturous

**INT. CAR - HIGHWAY TO SEATTLE**

Max lies sprawled across the back seat, her body arranged in the boneless way of someone who has just expended every ounce of emotional energy they possess. Her sneakers are kicked off, her legs curled beneath her, and her head rests against the cool window glass. The steady thrum of tires on asphalt creates a rhythmic lullaby that pulls her toward sleep.

But sleep feels too ordinary for this moment. Too mundane for the lightning that still courses through her veins.

The euphoria hasn't faded‚Äîif anything, it's intensified during the drive, settling into her bones like warm honey. She keeps replaying the moment: her feet hitting the pavement, the desperate sprint across the hospital grounds, the collision of bodies that felt like the universe clicking back into alignment.

*She did it.*¬†The thought surfaces again and again, each time bringing a fresh wave of disbelief.

For years, the memory of leaving Chloe after William's funeral had lived in her chest like a splinter: sharp, constant, and infected with guilt. Every time she'd seen that lost fourteen-year-old face in her mind, every time she'd remembered the way Chloe had looked through the back window of this very car, the wound had reopened.

But today she'd rewritten history. Not with time manipulation or supernatural intervention, but with something far more powerful: choice. The simple, radical act of refusing to let the pattern repeat.

Max shifts against the seat, a dreamy smile playing at the corners of her mouth. The leather is sun-warmed beneath her cheek, and she can hear her parents talking quietly in the front seat, their voices a comforting murmur.

Already, she misses Chloe with an intensity that should be painful but somehow isn't. Instead, it feels like anticipation. Like the first day of summer vacation when you're a kid, all stretched out ahead of you with infinite possibility.

*""Sweet Chloe""*. Her mind conjures the image without effort: those wide, pleading blue eyes that had looked at her during their embrace. They'd been Chloe's secret weapon since forever, the nuclear option in any argument or disagreement.

Max could be furious about some stupid shit, arms crossed and jaw set in stubborn indignation, and then Chloe would deploy the baby blues... Those ocean eyes would go soft and vulnerable, pupils dilated with something between mischief and genuine remorse, and Max's resolve would crumble like a sandcastle at high tide.

*""Girl... you*¬†***knocks***¬†*me out!""*, Max thought, and the words made her lips twitch in a drowsy smile.

Even now, miles away and growing more distant by the minute, Chloe's presence fills the car. Max can still smell her skin, still feel the desperate strength of her arms, still hear the way her voice cracked when she promised to come back.

The memory slides into her consciousness, unbidden but welcome. Just days ago, back when things still felt normal, before that godforsaken night, before the hospital, before everything fell apart...

**CUT TO:**

**INT. BATHROOM ‚Äì EARLY MORNING - MEMORY**

The mirror is fogged slightly from the earlier shower, the overhead light humming faintly. Max stands at the sink in her pajama, toothbrush in one hand, elbow leaned lazily on the counter. Chloe, only wearing her bra and pair of dark blue flared jeans, extending well past her ankles, brushes beside her, humming something tuneless through the foam.

Max spits, rinses, and wipes her mouth with the back of her sleeve. As Chloe bends over the sink to rinse, Max casually steps onto the bathroom scale tucked beneath the cabinet.

She glances down at a number that's become depressingly familiar. The slow slide downward over the past six months, stress stealing her appetite.

**MAX**  
*(murmuring to herself)*  
Ninety-eight...

Chloe catches the number out of the corner of her eye just as she spits and straightens up.

**CHLOE**  
Whoa! What the fuck?

**MAX**  
*(startled, defensive)*  
What?!

**CHLOE**  
Dude, are you seriously telling me you don't even weigh a hundred pounds?

**MAX**  
Chloe!

**CHLOE**  
*(teasing, raising an eyebrow)*  
Think I saw cats heavier than that.

Max flushes pink, lips parting in disbelief.

**MAX**  
Oh, yeah? Let‚Äôs see yours, tough guy.

Chloe grins and nudges Max aside with her hip, stepping up with theatrical flair. The scale creaks under her bare feet. The needle flies past 98 like a Concorde and kisses the 150.

**CHLOE**  
*(reading it proudly)*  
Boom! Working-class goddess: on the stand.

**MAX**  
*(squinting at it)*  
Damn. You‚Äôve been hauling kegs¬†*and*¬†inhaling my mac and cheese...

**CHLOE**  
*(flexing her arms)*  
Yeah, well. Someone‚Äôs gotta be the muscle in this relationship.

**MAX**  
*(smirking)*  
Guess I'm the brains, huh?

**CHLOE**  
Nah. You're the brains¬†*and*¬†the emotional damage.

Max chuckles and gently punches Chloe‚Äôs arm.

**MAX**  
Jerk.

**CHLOE**  
*(feigning pain)*  
Ow! Assault from under triple digits! Somebody call the cops.

They both laugh, the kind that lingers a little longer than expected.

**MAX**  
*(aroused, eyes flicking up at Chloe‚Äôs reflection in the mirror)*  
I don't even feel safe around you. You could squish me like a lemon.

Chloe freezes mid-step, still on the scale. Then she slowly steps down, the scale thunking back against the tile, her bare feet deliberate and heavy. The humor fades from her face, replaced by something low and smoldering.

She stalks toward Max with slow, theatrical menace. Her shadow overtakes Max in the mirror as she looms over her: taller, broader, more solid. Max swallows hard, her breath catching slightly as Chloe crowds into her space.

**CHLOE**  
*(low, serious)*  
You're goddamn right, Maxine Caulfield.

She leans in, so close her breath grazes Max‚Äôs ear.

**CHLOE**  
You¬†*shouldn‚Äôt*¬†feel safe around me.

Max's eyes widen, her whole body electrified. Her voice is barely a whisper.

**MAX**  
*(half-breath, half-challenge)*  
Then, what are you gonna do about it?

Chloe‚Äôs lips hover just behind her jawline, not touching, just letting the tension coil tighter.

**CHLOE**  
*(teasing)*  
Nothing... unless you¬†*ask*¬†me to.

Max turns slowly to face her, staring up at Chloe like she‚Äôs a thunderstorm she‚Äôs about to kiss.

A long, electric silence.

**MAX**  
*(softly)*  
Please.

Without a word, she reaches for the top button of Max‚Äôs pajama shirt. Her fingers are steady. Slow and reverent. One button at a time, she works her way down, never breaking eye contact.

Max‚Äôs chest rises and falls in shallow breaths, her lips parted slightly, waiting.

Once the last button is undone, Chloe slides the shirt from Max‚Äôs shoulders, letting it dangle behind her like the last defense. Max stands still, goosebumps prickling her skin from the cool air ‚Äî or maybe from the way Chloe looks at her.

Then, to Max‚Äôs surprise, Chloe slips her arms into the shirt herself.

**MAX**  
*(confused, breathy)*  
What are you‚Ä¶?

Chloe doesn‚Äôt answer. She just starts forcing the shirt on, arm by arm. The sleeves are laughably short, barely reaching past her elbows. Her broad shoulders stretch the seams as she tries to pull it across her chest.

She struggles to button it, managing a few with effort, the fabric pulling taut around her torso like a rubber band on the verge of snapping.

**CHLOE**  
*(flatly)*  
This shirt is a bit tight...

She grins, mischief returning to her eyes.

Then she turns her back to Max, plants her feet, and lets out a deep breath as she spreads her lats like she‚Äôs striking a pose at a bodybuilding competition.

**RIPPPPPP.**

The shirt¬†**explodes at the seams**, shredded down the back, threads flying like popcorn. One button¬†*pings*¬†off the sink.

Max lets out a soft gasp, somewhere between awe and arousal.

**MAX**  
*(barely breathing)*  
Fuck, Chloe‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs so hot‚Ä¶

Chloe turns around, what‚Äôs left of the shirt hanging off her like tissue paper.

**CHLOE**  
*(raising an eyebrow, voice low)*  
You're into Hulk cosplay now?

Max nods slowly, eyes wide, voice trembling with hunger.

**MAX**  
*(smiling)*  
Only if you promise to smash...

They both burst into laughter, the kind that breaks tension without deflating it, because behind the jokes, the heat still simmers. Chloe takes a step forward.

**CHLOE**  
Oh, I‚Äôm gonna smash, alright.

Without warning, Chloe drops low, wraps one strong arm behind Max‚Äôs knees, and in one seamless motion hoists her up with almost insulting ease, like a prize won at the county fair.

**MAX**  
*(startled)*  
Chloe!

Her legs dangle mid-air, toes wiggling helplessly as she‚Äôs carried through the doorway. Chloe moves like it‚Äôs nothing.

She strides into the bedroom with purpose and launches Max onto the bed with a bounce. Max lands on the mattress with a muffled yelp, limbs splayed like a starfish.

**CHLOE**  
*(grinning, ripping off the torn pajama shirt)*  
Okay, let‚Äôs see if I can do¬†*even more*¬†damage.

She shrugs out of what‚Äôs left of the shirt, letting it fall like battlefield debris, and begins climbing onto the bed, straddling Max with a predator‚Äôs grin.

But just as Chloe braces herself, ready to pounce‚Äî

**MAX**  
*(low, breathless)*  
Chloe...

Chloe pauses, not quite catching it.

**MAX**  
*(again, softer)*  
Chloe.

Chloe blinks, still hovering above her.

**CHLOE**  
What¬†*is*¬†it?

**MAX**  
*(staring at the ceiling, utterly spent)*  
I... think I‚Äôm done.

Chloe furrows her brow, not understanding.

**CHLOE**  
*(confused)*  
What do you mean, you're done?

**MAX**  
I mean... I'm¬†*done*.

A second of stunned silence. Chloe leans back slightly, eyes narrowing.

Then, realization dawns. Her jaw drops.

**CHLOE**  
No.  
Fucking.  
*Way.*

**MAX**  
*(murmuring, drained)*  
Yes, way...

Chloe slowly sits back on her heels, eyes wide like she just witnessed a solar eclipse.

**CHLOE**  
*(in awe)*  
I mean...¬†*how*¬†is that even possible?

**MAX**  
*(half-asleep)*  
I dunno... you're a menace...

Chloe stands and stumbles backward like she‚Äôs just been knighted, grabbing the nearest chair and collapsing into it, still staring at Max like she‚Äôs an alien species.

She exhales a stunned, slow breath. A smile begins to creep across her face.

**CHLOE**  
*(to herself, reverently)*  
Goddamn. I guess I really¬†*am*¬†the working-class goddess.

She leans forward, elbows on her knees, unable to stop grinning.

**CHLOE**  
I mean... I'm¬†*that*¬†good?

She glances toward Max.

**CHLOE**  
I never even thought that was possible.

**CHLOE**  
*(to Max, half-laughing)*  
Right?

Silence.

**CHLOE**  
*(leaning forward)*  
*Right*?

She finally looks... and sees Max.

Out cold.

Face buried in the pillow. Mouth slightly open. Completely unconscious.

Chloe sits back in the chair, slack-jawed.

**CHLOE**  
*(staring at her like she just dropped dead)*  
You‚Äôve gotta be shitting me.

A beat. She lets out a small, proud snort, shaking her head.

**CHLOE**  
I didn‚Äôt even get my pants off...

**CUT TO:**

**INT. CAR - HIGHWAY TO SEATTLE - CONTINUOUS**

Max's eyes flutter closed, a flush creeping up her neck despite the cool air conditioning. The memory burns bright and vivid behind her eyelids, every detail crystal clear. She can almost feel the phantom weight of Chloe's hands on her skin, can almost hear the low rumble of her voice saying her name like a prayer.

A soft sigh escapes her lips, and she shifts against the seat, suddenly hyper-aware of her parents in the front seat. The mundane sounds of the highway, the turn signal clicking... feel absurdly ordinary compared to the fire still burning in her chest.

*God, what she wouldn't give for ten minutes of privacy right now.*

But instead she's trapped in the back seat of her parents' car, miles from the person who makes her feel most alive, surrounded by the careful quiet of adult concern. The irony isn't lost on her. Here she is, probably having just made the most adult decision of her life, and she's reduced to stealing moments of memory like a teenager hiding contraband.

She opens her eyes and stares out at the passing landscape, Washington state rolling by in shades of green and gray. Somewhere behind them, Chloe is probably settling into her hospital routine, probably missing Max as much as Max misses her.

The memory of Chloe's promise echoes in her mind. Max smiles, closing her eyes again. She can wait. After all, some things are worth waiting for. The car continues north, carrying Max toward Seattle and toward whatever comes next. But part of her heart stays behind, tethered to a girl in hospital scrubs who promised to fight her way back to living.

**EXT. CAULFIELD HOUSE - SEATTLE - AFTERNOON**

The family car pulls into the familiar cul-de-sac, its tires crunching softly over the asphalt. The Caulfield house looks exactly the same as it did when Max last left it: pale siding, tidy flowerbeds, a welcome mat faded by years of rain. Nothing‚Äôs changed, except her.

Max lingers in the driveway, her sneakers sinking into the gravel. She stares up at her old window, blinds drawn against the setting sun. She hasn‚Äôt slept in that room for months, not since those frantic weeks after Arcadia Bay, when she and Chloe had crashed here before bolting to Salem.

Her heart gives a small, traitorous skip. For a second, she expects to see blue hair in the window, a silhouette waiting for her. Of course it‚Äôs empty. The realization lands in her body with a dull ache, like something has been surgically removed and the phantom pain still lingers.

**INT. MAX‚ÄôS BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER**

Max steps inside cautiously, as though entering a museum exhibit of her own life. Everything is preserved: her camera gear stacked neatly on the desk, fairy lights coiled over the corkboard, a half-finished roll of film left abandoned near her dresser. The air smells faintly of dust and lavender detergent.

She runs a hand across the comforter, the fabric oddly foreign under her fingertips. The last time she‚Äôd been here, Chloe had sprawled across that bed, scrolling through Max‚Äôs playlists and loudly mocking her taste in indie folk. Now the room feels cavernous, too neat, too untouched.

The glee from the car ride falters. That warm honey in her bones curdles, leaving a hollow coldness. She sinks onto the mattress, her hand automatically reaching across the space beside her. Empty.

Her chest tightens. Something's missing.

**INT. MAX‚ÄôS BEDROOM - EVENING**

After a nap that feels more like a blackout, Max blinks awake to the dim glow of her fairy lights. For a moment she‚Äôs disoriented, half expecting Chloe‚Äôs raspy voice to tease her awake. Instead there‚Äôs only the faint clatter of dishes from the kitchen downstairs.

Loneliness presses in, quiet but insistent. Her parents are here, and that helps, but it‚Äôs not the connection she‚Äôs desperate for. She grabs her phone, thumb hovering over contacts she hasn‚Äôt scrolled through in months.

KRISTEN.  
FERNANDO.

Her old Seattle crew. The last people she ghosted before Arcadia swallowed her whole. She hasn‚Äôt spoken to them since September, almost a year ago. The idea of reaching out knots her stomach. It feels like opening a door to a past version of herself she promised she‚Äôd outgrow.

Max exhales, rubbing her face with both hands. She knows why the urge is clawing at her now. Old habits. The same avoidant reflex that kept her from answering Chloe‚Äôs messages for years. The same cowardice dressed up as self-preservation.

She closes her eyes, whispering into the stillness:

**MAX**¬†(V.O.)  
Not again. Not doing that again.

Her thumb hovers, trembling, between ‚Äúcall‚Äù and ‚Äúexit.‚Äù

The line rings. Once. Twice.  
A click.

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
*(over speaker, cheerful but rushed)*  
Max? Oh my god! I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre actually calling me.

**MAX**  
*(softly)*  
Yeah. Hey, Kris.

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
Wow, it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ forever. Like, almost a year? What‚Äôs going on? You back in Seattle?

**MAX**  
Yeah. Got in today. Just‚Ä¶ settling back in, I guess.

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
That‚Äôs wild. I honestly thought you were still in Oregon. Where even were you? Arcadia Bay was all over the news...

**MAX**  
Yeah, came back for a while, but I left for Salem shorty after.

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
Well, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre okay. So‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs up?

**MAX**  
Nothing much. Just thought maybe we could hang out, catch up? It‚Äôs been so long.

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
Oh, uh‚Ä¶ wow. Yeah, that‚Äôd be‚Ä¶ fun. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ tonight‚Äôs kinda tough. I‚Äôve got a lot going on.

**MAX**  
Oh?

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
Well, um‚Ä¶ I promised my mom I‚Äôd help her with some house stuff. And, uh‚Ä¶ homework. Still taking night classes, you know.

Max frowns slightly, sensing the dodge.

**MAX**  
It doesn‚Äôt have to be tonight. Maybe tomorrow?

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
Tomorrow‚Äôs‚Ä¶ tricky too. Brandon‚Äîuh, my boyfriend‚Äîhe‚Äôs taking me out. Sort of a tradition now, Wednesday dinners.

**MAX**  
Boyfriend, huh? That‚Äôs new.

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
*(laughing nervously)*  
Yeah. We‚Äôve been together a few months. He‚Äôs great. You‚Äôd love him. Super funny. Anyway, yeah, we‚Äôve got plans. And honestly the rest of this week‚Äôs kind of crazy too.

**MAX**  
*(pushing, gently)*  
We could even just grab coffee, twenty minutes. Nothing big.

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
God, I‚Äôd love to, Max, really. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ everything‚Äôs so slammed right now. Work, school, Brandon‚Ä¶ you know how it is.

Silence stretches. Kristen fills it with another rushed laugh.

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
But hey, it‚Äôs awesome hearing your voice. We should definitely plan something soon. When things calm down.

**MAX**  
Yeah. Totally. No worries.

**KRISTEN**¬†(O.S.)  
Cool. I‚Äôll text you, okay? Promise.

**MAX**  
Okay, then. C ya soon.

The call ends. Max stares at her reflection in the dark glass, her smile collapsing. For a moment, it feels like something caves in. She sets the phone down beside her, curls forward, hands gripping her knees.

**MAX**¬†(V.O.)  
Well, fuck you too, Kris. Wait, that's unfair... Who cares? Big whoop. Is this how it's gonna be, huh? Fuck, I'm such a bitch. No. Not my fault. Not this time. But isn't it, though? I mean... FUCK! Nope, not doing this again!

Her thumb drifts back to her contacts. FERNANDO. She hesitates, then presses call.

**SPLIT SCREEN ‚Äî INTERCUT BETWEEN MAX‚ÄôS ROOM AND FERNANDO‚ÄôS LIVING ROOM**

FERNANDO picks up on the third ring. He‚Äôs lounging on a couch, textbooks and a laptop spread around him.

**FERNANDO**  
*(laughing lightly)*  
Holy crap. Max Caulfield? Thought you got abducted by aliens or something.

**MAX**  
*(chuckling nervously)*  
Close enough.

Awkward silence for a beat.

**MAX**  
I‚Äôm back in Seattle. Been‚Ä¶ a while.

**FERNANDO**  
No kidding. Last time I saw you, you had braces.

**MAX**  
Jesus. Don‚Äôt remind me.

They laugh. The ice cracks just enough.

**FERNANDO**  
So what‚Äôs up? You wanna hang?

**MAX**  
Yeah. I mean, if you‚Äôre not busy.

**FERNANDO**  
Nah, just drowning in homework. But I could use a break. Come by around, say, 7:30?

**MAX**  
*(relieved)*  
Yeah, that's perfect.

**FERNANDO**  
Cool. Same place as always. Don‚Äôt get lost.

**MAX**  
*(smiling faintly)*  
I won‚Äôt.

They hang up. Max exhales, lying back on her bed. The ceiling stares back at her, blank and pale. Her chest feels lighter, not fixed, not whole, but lighter.

She grabs her camera from the desk and snaps a picture of the fairy lights. The shutter click breaks the silence.

**EXT. FERNANDO‚ÄôS NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHTFALL**

Max walks briskly through familiar suburban streets, hands stuffed into her hoodie pocket, her camera slung at her side. Porch lights flicker on one by one, illuminating patches of sidewalk. She stops at a modest two-story house, paint a little chipped but warm with life. The muffled sound of voices filters through an open window.

She takes a breath, steels herself, and rings the doorbell.

**INT. FERNANDO‚ÄôS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS**

The door swings open. FERNANDO stands there with his easy grin. For a beat, Max feels like she‚Äôs never left.

**FERNANDO**  
Well, look who it is! Come here.

They hug, brief but genuine. Max smiles faintly, a little shy.

**MAX**  
Hey, Fer. You look‚Ä¶ older.

**FERNANDO**  
(laughs)  
Yeah, happens when time doesn‚Äôt stop. Come on in.

**INT. FERNANDO‚ÄôS LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER**

The room is cozy, a big TV dominating one wall. A couch, an armchair, a low coffee table covered in snacks‚Äîchips, soda cans, half a pizza box. Fernando tosses Max a soda before flopping onto the couch.

**FERNANDO**  
So, how‚Äôs it feel being back?

**MAX**  
I dunno, kinda weird.

**FERNANDO**  
I bet. After all that happened in Arcadia...

**MAX**  
Yeah.

**FERNANDO**  
It was crazy what happened. I wanted to contact you, thought that maybe you needed some space after everything, you know...

**MAX**  
Yeah, it's fine, just... a lot of people...

Before she can finish, the front door opens again. Three other guys spill in, laughing, carrying more snacks. They‚Äôre all Fernando‚Äôs age: loud, comfortable, at home.

**FERNANDO**  
*(to the group)*  
Hey, this is Max. Old friend from way back.

The boys mumble casual hellos, already unpacking controllers. Max raises a polite hand.

**MAX**  
Hey.

**LATER**

**INT. FERNANDO‚ÄôS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT**

**MUSIC CUE**:¬†[*Promise*](https://song.link/i/1440805209)¬†by¬†***Ben Howard***¬†begins playing.

The game roars on. Laughter. Shouts. The boys are fully locked in, controllers clicking, trash talk flying. Fernando is animated, leaning forward, yelling at the screen. Max sits in the armchair, hands curled around a soda can gone flat.

At first, she smiles. Their laughter is infectious. She tries to ride the wave, nodding along when Fernando glances her way. But soon the jokes pile up‚Äînames she doesn‚Äôt know, stories she wasn‚Äôt there for. The laughter grows louder, faster, shutting her out. Her smile falters. She shifts in her seat.

She studies Fernando‚Äôs face: alive, bright, so different from the boy she remembers. She should be happy for him. Instead, a hollow ache spreads in her chest. She stares at the untouched chips on the table. The laughter stings sharper now, like a reminder:¬†*You don‚Äôt belong here.*

Max presses the soda can against her temple, the cold sting grounding her. Still, her body feels heavier, her thoughts slipping inward. She watches Fernando high-five one of the guys. Inside jokes she doesn't get. More laughter. Her heart sinks.

**MAX**¬†(V.O.)  
This was a terrible mistake. What the hell am I doing here? Thought you could just swoop in like nothing happened, huh? Stupid Max.

She sets the soda can down quietly, as if afraid to disturb the rhythm of their world. She stands, moving carefully toward the door. Nobody notices. Nobody stops her. She slips outside.

**EXT. FERNANDO‚ÄôS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS**

The night air hits her lungs sharp and cold. Max lingers on the step, wrapping her arms around herself. Her face twists‚Äîhurt, disappointment, anger‚Äîbut mostly, the unbearable weight of loneliness. She swallows it down, blinking hard. The muffled laughter inside rattles her a bit.

She steps off the porch, walking slowly down the sidewalk. Each footfall feels heavier than the last. Her throat burns, but no tears fall.¬†*Keep moving,*¬†she tells herself.

Behind her, the door creaks open.

**FERNANDO**  
*(confused, calling softly)*  
Max? You‚Äôre leaving?

Max freezes mid-step, shoulders tight. She slowly turns. Fernando stands in the doorway, framed by warm light and the muffled shouts of his friends behind him.

**MAX**  
*(quiet, hesitant)*  
Yeah‚Ä¶ I should probably go.

**FERNANDO**  
*(stepping out, frowning)*  
Why? You just got here.

**MAX**  
*(shrugging)*  
I dunno. I don‚Äôt really fit in with‚Ä¶ all that.

She gestures vaguely toward the laughter inside. Fernando follows her gaze, then looks back at her. His smile fades.

**FERNANDO**  
They‚Äôre just some friends. I'm sorry, I should have probably told you...

**MAX**  
*(quickly)*  
No, it's totally fine. I guess I just got a bit ahead of myself. They‚Äôre your people now. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ crashing the party.

**FERNANDO**  
That‚Äôs bullshit. You‚Äôre not crashing anything. You‚Äôre my friend, Max. I never forgot.

Max looks down, her sneakers scuffing against the sidewalk.

**MAX**  
It doesn‚Äôt feel that way. Everything moved on while I was gone. Kristen, you, everyone‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ stuck.

**FERNANDO**  
Max‚Ä¶

He steps closer, lowering his voice. He sees her pale face in the streetlight, the tired eyes she can‚Äôt hide. Fernando notices there's something seriously wrong behind Max's eyes. Not as he remembers them. He closes the door gently behind him.

**FERNANDO**  
Max... is everything okay?

A beat.

Max blinks rapidly, trying to hold back tears.

**MAX**  
*(voice cracking)*  
Uh... no. Not exactly.¬†*(looks down)*

Fernando‚Äôs chest tightens. He hesitates, then pulls her into a hug‚Äîfirm, grounding. Max stiffens at first, then melts into it, clinging tighter than she expected.

**FERNANDO**  
*(softly)*  
How about we meet up this Saturday? Just you and me. We'll stop by to get some ice-cream from The Salty Pretzel, maybe go to The Needle. You always loved taking pictures from up there. Huh? What do ya' say?

Max flashes a sweet smile and nods with her eyes closed.

**MAX**  
Promise.

**FERNANDO**  
Awesome. Just hang in there Maxi-Max, 'kay? You're the shit.

Max smiles fondly.

**MAX**  
Deal. C ya' then, Fernando.

The music swells as Max walks home through the familiar neighborhood. Still feeling lost, but having something to look forward to, other than torturous waiting and waiting.

She pauses under a streetlamp, automatically framing the shot, warm yellow light cutting perfect circles into cracked pavement. Moths flutter overhead, drawn to the bulb like tiny ghosts, their wings casting erratic shadows across her face.

Max continues walking, her photographer's eye cataloging details with unsettling clarity. Mrs. Chen's crooked garden gnome. The Hendersons' dented mailbox. Faded chalk hopscotch squares on the Millers' driveway. Everything exactly as she left it. Everything wrong.

The April night carries the scent of blooming cherry trees and damp Seattle earth. Her footsteps echo against sleeping houses as she studies how shadows pool between parked cars, how streetlights create golden islands in the mist.

More moths spiral around each lamp she passes, their silent dance hypnotic in the cool air. She pulls her hoodie tighter and keeps walking toward home.

The familiar neighborhood wraps around her like an overexposed photograph, all the details sharp and present.

Hey there, gents 

I‚Äôm a 27-year-old creative soul who thrives on new ideas, new places, and meaningful connections. I live in the world of fashion and photography‚Äîalways chasing good light, good coffee, and good conversations. I‚Äôm curious by nature and a little explorative by heart, whether it‚Äôs discovering a hidden caf√© or getting lost in a deep conversation about life, art, or the human mind.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, slim, stylish, and confident‚Äîwith a soft spot for guys who embrace their masculinity but can still be kind, witty, and attentive. The type who can handle a little sass, match my curiosity, and maybe even teach me something new.

Also, I‚Äôm a transwoman‚Äîjust putting it upfront, because honesty is the best filter. (My photos/video on my profile) 

You: Fit or within a healthy BMI, clean, and effortlessly charming. If you‚Äôve got a strong presence, a warm smile, and that I‚Äôve-got-this energy‚Äîoh, I‚Äôm listening. Adventurous and youthful in spirit? Even better.

When you message, drop your ASL, a short intro, and something unique about you. Surprise me.

This is a write-up with some pictures of our holiday tour to Crete in summer 2025, we got home just a few weeks ago! I've been riding for more than a decade but my gf, let's call her J., only got her license last year, and two days later we departed for a tour of the Alps. We ended up riding about 4000km through Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and France. Gorgeous, but also well-traveled and well-known territory. 

For this year we wanted to do something a bit more adventurous, and after a lot of deliberation and staring at maps we decided on Crete, because neither of us had been to the Balkans yet, and we wanted to see more of Greece and Italy. We planned, roughly, for 9000km in 5 weeks.

## **Preparations**
***

***Bikes and luggage***

J. really likes the Tiger, and I'd just bought a new SMT in January. When it came to luggage I had a number of bags lying around from my previous trips, and decided to expand the set with a Kriega rackpack. The completed setup was as follows:

* Tiger: 42L top case, 30L Kriega drypack, 10L tank bag. Chain lock wrapped around the rear carrier.
* SMT: Kriega 40L rackpack, Kriega 30L drypack, 5L tank bag. Disc lock in the seat pocket.

The two locks allowed us to quickly [secure the bikes](https://imgur.com/a/KbxDPW7) and helmets anywhere we went. Both bikes also had a bottle holder with a thermos for (cold) drinking water attached to the front crash bars. For each bag we carried a spare strap, as well as some general purpose rokstraps and bungee cords. You never know when something might break, or when stuff falls off and you need to secure it somehow.

We each have a full mesh gear setup: jacket, pants, gloves, and riding sneakers topped off with fitted ear plugs, a buff, and Sena helmet kit. Both of us also carried a light rainjacket, waterproof riding overall, hiking boots, regular light shoes, a sweater, and some light regular clothing. In the tank bag we carried a tourniquet, emergency bandage, pocket knife, lighter, drinking water, some emergency food (energy bars), phone and charger, and miscellaneous stuff like sunglasses, camera, and paper maps. We also had two small first aid kits, a foil blanket, and some regular towels with us.

***Maintenance, spare parts, tools***

The Tiger was sitting at around 230k km and has been burning oil at an accelerating pace. It needs topping up every few days, so we decided to play it safe, and brought a 4L oil can with us, as well as some small spare parts (starter solenoid, sprocket nut and lockwasher). The SMT was brand new with only 9k on it, the main concern being that the 15k service should be done somewhere on the way for warranty purposes. For chain maintenance I carried a 1L bottle of 80w90 gear oil and a brush. We also had [a small toolkit](https://imgur.com/a/0psTdqg) with the basics required to work on the brakes, bodywork, get to the battery and fuses, and make emergency repairs (tape/tiewraps/wire). Both of us have worldwide roadside assistance, and since we weren't planning on straying too far from civilization we didn't carry camping or cooking gear, nor equipment to change tires. While on the road we would grease the chains and give the bikes a good lookover every few days at least.

***Navigation and lodging***

Both bikes have Garmin XTs mounted, and for each day we'd make a GPX in Kurviger and upload it to the navis. We had a general route in mind but the details were usually worked out over dinner the night before with some old-fashioned paper maps and some local information sprinkled in. Apart from the first and the last day we mostly avoided motorways, and on average did about 300km a day. We'd typically ride for 60 - 90 minutes each between breakfast, coffee, lunch, and afternoon drinks, and arrival so about 4 - 6 hours of riding each day. 

When it came to lodging we went with BnB's, apartments, and hotels found through the usual channels. I have done some light camping in the past but never on longer motorcycle trips and never with J., so if we ever wanted to, we'd have to do some practice runs first. We didn't have a strict budget per se, but tried to stay within about ‚Ç¨250 a day on average, including two tanks of fuel.

## **Leg 1: [Netherlands to Macedonia](https://imgur.com/a/EUMKvRV)**
***

* Day 1 and 2: Freiburg, Germany (700km)

We left around 11h00 for an _autobahn_ sit to Freiburg, arriving for dinner with friends of mine who live near the city. I know there's a lot to see in-between: the Ardennes, Luxemburg, the Black Forest, the Vosges.. but we've been to those places many, many times already and when you're on the way south it's preferable to take long strides sometimes. We suffered through heavy rainstorms near Frankfurt but by the time we pulled off the highway two hours later it was warm and dry. The next day we took a bit of a rest and explored the city together with my mates. Freiburg is a large university town with a young vibe and a lovely mix of provincial and cosmopolitan Germany. Worth a stop, if you're ever nearby. 

* Day 3: Lech, Austria (350km)

We took off through the southernmost part of the Black Forest to arrive on the shores of the Bodensee (Lac Konstanz) for a sun-drenched lunch. I'd plotted a route from Bregenz along the [200] and [198] in Tyrol cause I'd never been to that part of Austria yet, and it was pretty decent and a bit quiet. We got some light rain in the afternoon, but generally decent weather. Out hotel for the night was a very cheap but run down classic mountain lodge, with rooms that have been in dire need of an overhaul since about 1995. It seemed to me like the family who owned it was squeezing it for what it was worth without investing anything in the place. [Dinner](https://imgur.com/a/bHbaEXV) and breakfast were decent however, but the wifi and cell reception was nonexistent in the little valley.

* Day 4: Tolmezzo, Italy (350km)

We left in the morning fog towards Imst, a road with great views of the southern Alps across the valley, towards Italy. We took a short bit of highway to get past Innsbruck, then turned south and east to Zell am Ziller and the [Grossglockner](https://imgur.com/a/bVcSklw). I've mostly been to the Swiss and Italian side of the Alps so this famous road was on the to-do list still. We arrived on a weekday just after lunch which meant it was fairly quiet, but I can imagine it being busy and annoying on weekends. The road is great but the toll is outrageous: ‚Ç¨35 per bike. It's worth it, at least for once, because the views and landscape are absolutely stunning. The road was built as a tourist attraction starting in 1930 as it didn't exist as a historical pass or anything, hence the tolls. Once across the GG we went southeast to the beautiful little [Plockenpass into Italy](https://imgur.com/a/YeZ9eFv), and arrived at [our BnB near Tolmezzo](https://imgur.com/a/QdwomvD). From here on the weather was pretty much impeccable for the rest of our trip.

* Day 5: Obrov, Slovenia (350km)

We started with a quiet mountain outing in the morning, towards Paularo and then north over an eerily quiet and narrow road towards the (unpaved) Polentin pass. We didn't take it though, instead continuing east to Pontebba, and then up the Sella Nevea and Predil passes into Slovenia. We followed the [203] and [102] south along the river through countless villages with traffic cameras seemingly every 500 meters. The temperature also built steadily and in the afternoon we were buckling in the 35 degree heat. Took a break near the [Skjocjan Caves](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xMC2N6PriYnVSjrb7) where the Karst landscape has been worn out by rainfall and underground rivers into endless tunnels which at some point collapsed leaving a [giant crater](https://imgur.com/a/g29pmdj) in the landscape, a bizarre and gorgeous sight, but also quiet at this time of day and cool in the forest. We found a gorgeous BnB in the [hills east of Trieste](https://imgur.com/a/A7Dt59x) which included a lovely dinner with local wines, and breakfast.

* Day 6: Bihac, Bosnia and Herzegovina (400km)

This turned out to be one of the more interesting days, cause a lot happened in quick succession. We approached the Adriatic over some beautiful B roads to enjoy morning coffee at the [little boulevard in Bakar](https://imgur.com/a/Uu2Z16G), next to Rijeka. After this we followed the coast, zooming between campers and caravans, with gorgeous views of the sea and numerous islands to our right. At our lunch stop in Senj we were approached by a Dutch couple who just returned from a MotoGymKhana tournament in Zagreb so we spent some time talking bikes with them, and afterwards we went up into the hills towards Dabar and eventualle Zeljava. We saw several 'warning: mines' signs on the side of the road, and in one little village where we stopped for drinks we were greeted by the local car tuning club, bunch of guys with old Audi's and VW's, ogling J., who didn't feel quite at ease. I noticed that several of them had Ustase stickers on their cars (local version of the SS, basically), lovely bunch. Croatia apparently has a bit of a problem with far right extremists. We got the hell outta there as soon as our colas were through. This part of Croatia felt very remote and rough, and although there were plenty of signs advertising apartments and BnB's, there was hardly anyone on the road. Not long after this we arrived at [Zeljava air base](https://imgur.com/a/2USAZA0) which is fairly well known at this point and a nice opportunity for a cheesy picture. [The border with Bosnia](https://imgur.com/a/AdpKuV1) was only a few miles away and was very easy: no inspections, no questions, just a quick glance at our passports and that was it. Immediately afterwards the landscape changed, with occasional [mosques](https://imgur.com/a/QVjhrCU) and orthodox christian churches in the little villages next to the road, old tractors chugging along with carts full of produce, and children playing in the street. One of the staff of our motel in Bihac explained that it was peaceful now, Muslims, Christians, and everyone tolerating each other pretty much. We noticed how the mosque in town _did_ call for prayer like usual but in a rather quiet and short version unlike the minute-long yammering you get in the Middle East, and plenty of restaurants served alcohol. The crowd in the street also seemed varied, could've been anyplace Europe, basically. The town itself was situated along a shallow river with a fairground, restaurants, and bars and loads of people and kids around, it felt very organic and friendly. We had great burgers at a 'wine bar' which turned out to have exactly two kinds of wine, red and white.

* Day 7 and 8: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (300km)

Breakfast was intense: we got eggs, a bunch of baked or steamed vegetables, and no less than three different kinds of sausages as well as bacon and olives, and no coffee (which was off because [Bosnian coffee](https://imgur.com/a/wBJiDYF) in general is quite good). By god did I wish for an espresso and some croissants! We followed the main road along the river all day towards Sarajevo, and saw several more signs indicating mines as well as remnants from the war: numerous buildings, large and small, had bullet holes and even [grenade impacts](https://imgur.com/a/i4z3pxD), which had either been left in place or re-stucced in a different colour for emphasis. Gasoline was only about 1‚Ç¨ per liter which made for easy fueling, and all but the smallest places accepted card payments. We stopped for lunch in Jajce with its [gorgeous waterfalls](https://imgur.com/a/Jo0XbnO), situated among green rolling hills. The roads were generally good and traffic was light. It was quite hot in the afternoon so around Zenica we decided to take the highway for the last hour towards Sarajevo.

The next day we visited one of the [museums](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2JVpHjsi9jetyixZ7) about the siege which was.. a haunting experience. It's truly despicable how the international community sat by and watched while civilians were being starved and shot at daily for nearly four years. We walked around town a good bit and came across numerous monuments and memorials. In the afternoon we took the cable car up to Trebevic hill which gave a great [view of the city](https://imgur.com/a/QIIsjEn) and is the location of the [abandoned bobsled track](https://imgur.com/a/R9kgsk5) from the [1984 winter olympics](https://imgur.com/a/2xMBZj4). Like the rest of Bosnia, Sarajevo was in a reasonably good state and it felt clean, and modern. The old town is extremely touristy with all the garbage trinket shops, ice cream vendors, and tourist traps this brings, but at the same time it maintains a quaint and interesting atmosphere. 

* Day 9: Berane, Montenegro (300km)

About an hour east of Sarajevo we were taking a little roadside break, when suddenly a fluffy little shape walks across the road not 20ft away. I whisper to J. in my mic.. ""_there's a bear cub here, get back on the bike quick and quiet cause we need to go now_"". Really didn't feel like meeting his mom! The [R450] and [R467] feel quiet and remote, and run by some very pretty rocky canyons and little lakes. We crossed into Serbia later morning, just for a short stint cause the [182] goes nowhere except south into Montenegro. Both crossings were extremely quiet and easy without questions or hassle. The [P10] and [E65] south lead through some pretty landscapes, flowing green hills and mountains very much like the past few days, except it had been _desurfaced_ for a distance of nearly 20 miles in anticipation of major repairs/upgrades, so we spent almost an hour driving dead slow along rocky white gravel in a filthy dusty mist thrown up by the cars in front of us. My snot was like clay for hours after this and the bikes looked like they'd been through a [cement](https://imgur.com/a/RXnJg6r) [mixer](https://imgur.com/a/A0iF9OK).

* Day 10: Givgelija, Macedonia (400km)

Our hostel was situated on the ski slopes with a [magnificent breakfast view](https://imgur.com/a/w4JkU1U), after which we took the steep hairpins back down to the main road. We entered Kosovo half an hour later, the border crossing was busier than the others we'd had so far but not much of a hassle. We had to buy temporary insurance worth ‚Ç¨6 per bike since Kosovo is de facto independent from Serbia but not formally recognised by the European insurance companies yet. The [R106] down from the Montegrin mountains onto the Kosovo plain was spectacular with great tarmac, beautiful hairpins, and a sweet view. The central plain south of Pristina was extremely boring and busy and it was crazy hot as well, so we only dipped into the capital briefly for a glance at the Bill Clinton [statue](https://imgur.com/a/O4w0qTJ) (they're grateful to NATO in general and ol' Bill specifically for the 1999 intervention which eventually resulted in their independence) before heading south towards Macedonia. The combination of scorching heat and ferry ticket prices (to Crete) meant that we had to make a bit of speed these days. Highways aren't nearly always boring though, the [E75] southeast of Skopje weaves and bends through a beautiful rocky landscape with the occasional olive grove and winery. It was nice to be able to keep up the speed in the scorching heat. Our place for tonight was the quite luxurious but also very cheap Sky Hotel barely a mile north of the Greek border. We sat on the roof terrace in the still-heavy evening heat enjoying a beer and chatting with the waiter who spoke perfect English and recommended some local dishes to us. One of them seemed a bit like lasagna (oven dish with layers of vegetables, tomatoes, and cheese) however upon my comparison the guy was adamant that I was an idiot and that it was in fact not at all like lasagna.

## **Leg 2: [Greece](https://imgur.com/a/7xJ0zpt)**
***

* Day 11: Kalambaka, Greece (300km)

For most of our time in [Greece](https://imgur.com/a/0fJOzBl) the mid-day temperatures were around 35 degrees and we were stopping every 30-45mins for a drink, and if possible to dunk our buff and gloves in water somewhere which would make the next 30 mins on the bike bearable. This morning we followed the main road south to Thesaloniki and then Katerini, where we turned right into the hills, along the foot of [mount olympos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aGR3VAEcjhqrov846). The inner part of Greece isn't as touristy as the coast and some of the cities, so the roads were fairly quiet, first the [13] and then the [26] and [15] to Kalambaka and [the Meteora](https://imgur.com/a/nnliiNQ). We were absolutely soaking with sweat when we arrived, however the view is.. off this world. I can only imagine the reactions of the first stone-age Greeks as they ventured inland and came across [this landscape](https://imgur.com/a/aZXrn2k) which appears [straight out of a high fantasy series](https://imgur.com/a/hq1yRby). We took a long cold shower then went for a (slow!) walk [around the foot of these hills](https://imgur.com/a/OfmyFEX) (this is funny because I'm a biologist and the sign says MICROBIOLOGIKO) in the evening heat, we'd planned on going a longer circuit but the heat made it impossible. 

* Day 12: Piraeus (350km)

We left very early in the morning to try and beat the some of the worst heat, speeding along the [E65] towards Lamia along a valley which was [a good bit greener](https://imgur.com/a/rxcfHQr) than the rest of Greece, probably due to rain runoff from the surrounding mountains. Giant olive/orange/lime orchards were all over the place and the road was flanked by ancient rock quarries and a snaking railway that seemed rather newly built. Once up in the hills south of Lamia the temperature dropped somewhat and we got to take a number of [remote little roads](https://imgur.com/a/6sJlzDQ)(not pictured: 42 degrees celsius!) full of hairpins which ran straight through villages with very surprised looking old Greek men on the road side. We had a long [lunch and a swim in Antikyra](https://imgur.com/a/t4b6gv7), and around 15h00 we wetted our gear once again to brace against the stifling heat on the road to Athens. We had planned for a curvy coastal road but we were so tired and fed up with the heat that we decided to stick to the main roads and even took a bit of highway. Interesting to note is that the Greek toll system is very different from the French/Spanish/Italian ones, in the sense that you don't take a ticket and pay when you leave the road, but you just stop at a toll station every 10-20km on the road and pay directly for that distance. Oftentimes it was no more than 50 cents, occasionally 1 or 2 euro's. 

Athens and the surroundings suffer from a terrible case of urban heat syndrome and evening traffic made it all the worse, it was close to 40 degrees on the main road into Piraeus. We were splitting at a decent pace between the commuters but still local bikes and scooters zoomed around us every which way.

* Day 13 and 14: Matala (100km)

We boarded the ferry [Piraeus -> Heraklion](https://imgur.com/a/tZ4ERL7) around 08h30 with a large backpack full of groceries: water, bread, olives, snacks, some fruit, etc. The onboard offerings are usually overpriced medium quality so it's best to bring your own. We picked a nice spot in the shade on the rear deck and spent the day gazing our over the mediterranean, reading, or sipping coffee (the only thing worth buying from the bar, basically). At one point I though I saw some dolphins in the distance but was unable to verify :(

Crete is a little cooler than the mainland which felt like a welcome change, and the ride south across the island to [Matala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matala,_Crete) was uneventful. We found a nice little guest house with airconditioning and a good place to park, so all was well. We took a rest the next day, went [hiking](https://imgur.com/a/RlxikkH), swimming, enjoyed a long seaside lunch followed by a siesta, and sauntered along the little town which while rather touristy on the hand, was also small enough to maintain a distinct aura of local innocence on the other. There's a cute little harbour with a small beach and beautiful [rock formations](https://imgur.com/a/Dgdoc9p) right next to it, [hippie graffiti and art](https://img1.vakantio.de/uploads/f83fb11285e4535ba04c81438f9a2a7d_large.avif), as well as a lot of small bars and restaurants. Not a bad place for a break!

* Day 15 and 16: Rethymno (350km)

We rode along the rocky coastal road westwards towards Selia and Komitades, and then north and slightly easy back to Rethymno. The mountains sometimes seem to rise straight from the sea! We passed through [several](https://imgur.com/a/J2PUouS) [rocky gorges](https://imgur.com/a/3a9kxWQ) where all life had gone grey and yellow except right next to what used to be the stream. Even insects were few and far between since it hadn't rained in over a month with consistent 30-degree temperatures. The southern coast is rather quiet with only the occasional tour bus going to the gorges, on the other hand the northern coast is extremely touristy and rather bland. Endless hotels, resorts, restaurants and a huge traffic jam all the way in between. Rethymno itself has a decent boulevard and harbour but the town itself is inundated with tourists and it's difficult to find affordable and authentic places to eat and shop. It's basically the same souvenir store with fridge magnets, coffee cups, and dresses copy-pasted a few hundred times. 

We took a bit of a rest day after this, J. was a bit tired so she hopped on the back of the SMT and we drove a bit west to see the [ruins of Aptera](https://imgur.com/a/BtdR5As) and then went for lunch + a swim in the town of Stavros just north of Chania. Turned out to have been the exact beach location used in the movie [Zorba the Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorba_the_Greek_\(film\)). 

* Day 17: Heraklion (100km)

We left early in the morning because I had an appointment with the KTM garage in Heraklion - it was sitting at nearly 14.000km and the 15k service was near. Napels might also have been an option but that might have been stretching it. Any way we arrived at the shop around 10h00 to find all the lifts occupied and nobody in a rush to help despite the appointment. We had to wait a good half hour before the lead mechanic was finished and told us it'd take at least two hours for the oil change and minor checks, so we spent the rest of the morning and lunch at a nearby caf√© under the blissful air conditiong. We had planned to go for a longer ride in the afternoon towards Arkalohchori but the long wait and the stifling heat killed the mood, so we went for an early check in at our hotel, spending the rest of the afternoon and evening strolling around town, visiting museums and writing postcards. The [Heraklion Archaological Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ficYA6SQZFYV2udB8) was sweet, they had [so much stuff](https://imgur.com/a/3fwLREq) that they could easily split into five different museums each with a proper collection!

* Day 18: Nafplion (200km)

The return [ferry to Piraeus](https://imgur.com/a/BQbSMtZ) left at 09h00 and we were well-prepared again with our bag of groceries. In retrospect it would've been preferable to stay a few more days on Crete considering the costs of the ferry (‚Ç¨120 for a one-way for two pax and two bikes), and I wouldn't have minded spending another day or two in Matala and having another day for a bike trip either to the eastern or western point of the island. But we had a wee bit of a schedule to keep and were also dependent on the Igoumenitsa - Brindisi ferry which was far more expensive and this required careful planning.

It was hot again in Piraeus late afternoon, so we quickly jumped on the bikes and made our way across the Isthmus of Corinth towards Nafplion in the peloponnese. A gorgeous old town with a touristy aftertaste, Nafplion has been an important harbour since Roman times, with several large fortresses either [in the harbour](https://imgur.com/a/tqqWHGm) or [on the hills](https://imgur.com/a/aQFQjTF) right behind it.

* Day 19: Vonitsa (350km)

From Nafplion we drove around the bay to Lerna and then west into the hills of the Arcadia, already famous in ancient times for its 'untouched' landscape. We followed the [7], [111] and the [33] west, then turned north near Agria Triade, towards Patras. It was at this point that the rear hugger of the Tiger broke and started rattling like crazy. We got lucky at one of the gas stations when the clerk had [a drill I could borrow](https://imgur.com/a/rbKit10), and I fixed it with a nice [tiewrap stitch](https://imgur.com/a/DUOX0wB). It was also during this day that J. cried out in pain at some point, when a hornet the size of a fist took a bite out of her leg, right through her mesh suit. Even three weeks later the damn wound hasn't healed completely. It doesn't sound like much but this was one of my favorite days in Greece since it was quiet, green, not _too_ hot in the mountains, and just hours and hours of endless curves and pretty landscapes. From Patras we went north to the little peninsula of Aitoliko which is an extremely run-down town which to be honest should have been a tourist hotspot, considering the location on the coast, and the views.

## **Leg 3: [Italy and back home](https://imgur.com/a/4IfzBCs)**
***

* Day 20: Brindisi, Italy (150km)

Our [ferry to Italy](https://imgur.com/a/SAti71g) left at 14h00 only, so we took a slow morning with breakfast along the shores of the Ambracian gulf, near the location where in 31 BCE Octavian (the later emperor Caesar Augustus) with a little help from Marcus Agrippa [defeated the forces of Marc Antony and Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium), effectively becoming sole ruler of the mediterranean and shaping Europe for the ages. From there we took the sweet coastal road past Lichnos and Sivota and arrived in Igoumenitsa in time for some lunch and grocery shopping. The ferry itself was uneventful and our hostel for the night was a rundown place so I won't waste time on that.

* Day 21 and 22: Sorrento (450km)

We left at 07h00 and made our way along the [E90] to Taranto for breakfast. This part of Apulia is flat with mainly agriculture and a lot of abandoned and ruined farmhouses and industry. Even the roadside is filthy with trash dumped everywhere. After a sweet Italian breakfast and some cappuchinos with a view of the Taranto harbour, we continued north-west into the hills along the [E847], [SP103] and [SS92], coming by some some pretty historical villages (and ruins) such as Pisticci, [Craco](https://imgur.com/a/nIPOew8), and Stigliano. Once near Potenza it was getting awfully hot again so from here on we stuck to the main roads before arriving at the stunning [Amalfi coast](https://imgur.com/a/ciBQWU6) near Salerno. If you're ever in the neighbourhood, go here, rent a bike, and drive the [SS163] here!

The next day we drove down to the Sorrento harbour in [the local biker outfit](https://imgur.com/a/czTDXNu), and took the ferry into Napoli harbour and played tourist for a bit, before taking the train back in the evening. We had real nice BnB on a hill near Vico Equense which offered [sweet views of Napoli bay and the Visuvius](https://imgur.com/a/pzEu5FT)!

* Day 23: Cassino (300km)

We followed the coast towards Pompeii then took a number of quiet mountain roads (which I can't find on the map for the life of me) towards Avellino and Benevento. From there we stuck to the hills all the way towards Piedimonte, Pietrovairano with it's beautiful (and only very recently discovered) [Roman theatre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/imfMfi2Rqo1PftUc8), and eventually Cassino where drove up all the way to [the abbey](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zNfdCF5skY5B63dh6) for a stroll. The abbey was completely destroyed by the USAF in 1944 (along with several hundred refugees sheltering) because intel indicated that the Germans were using it as an observation post (which was false). Look up [the battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino) if you're even remotely interested in history!

* Day 24: Trasimene (350km)

From Cassino we headed to the coast near Latina to circumvent Rome as much as possible (already been there - not keen on traffic!) and had coffee on the beach near the Fiumichino airport. From there we followed the coast all the way to Tarquinia where we turned right towards Viterbo, the ancient [Papal residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Popes_in_Viterbo), then continued inland along the highway towards lake Trasimene, the location of [the second of Hannibals' stunning victories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Trasimene) against the Romans during the second Punic war. The landscape in this part of Italy is green rolling hills, much unlike the dry near-desert of the south. We found an [old-fashioned but affordable](https://imgur.com/a/BtChvyA) and friendly hotel a little ways away from the lake shore.

* Day 25 and 26: Cinque Terre (350km)

From Trasimene we crossed Tuscany towards Siena en Pontedera, a hypertouristic region but also well deserved. The landscape is a characteristic greenish/brown dotted with cypress-lined country lanes, orchards and vineyards, and the architecture is [extremely picturesque](https://iconiclife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tuscany-Italy-countryside.jpg). We went by the iconic [Gladiator filming location](https://imgur.com/a/BEfa0u6) and definitely weren't the only one in line. Foreign license plates are everywhere and traffic in the bigger towns is super busy. There's also wine-tastings advertised every couple miles at least so being on the road here in the late afternoon carries a bit of risk no doubt. Lastly we took a wee bit of highway to La Spezia since it was, again, stupid hot, and once there turned onto the hills just behind Cinque Terre to reach Manarola, our stay for tonight. CT is one of the most touristic places in Italy ([and well-deserved tbh](https://imgur.com/a/CJP7UUv)), and the most iconic five towns are difficult to reach by vehicle, we had to [park nearly a mile outside the little town along the road](https://imgur.com/a/fuLzsrl) and carry our luggage all the way. We managed to find an affordable BnB with a _great_ breakfast for just over ‚Ç¨100 a night; most other places were more than twice as expensive.

The day after we took a nice lazy rest, went swimming in the [little rocky harbour](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bbcf00a9b8fe874ed2f03d0/75b3da41-f663-4d86-9225-4c1bba64f00e/cinque-terre-manarola.jpg?format=2500w), took the train to nearby [Vernazza](https://imgur.com/a/x51YTg6) (absolute _packed_ with tourists: American, Chinese, German mostly it seemed), had an expensive but lovely lunch, and then boated back to Manarola. CT is expensive in the main season but [the coast is stunning](https://imgur.com/a/BwzCJ7X) so if you're ever around and can find a decently-priced place to stay (or simply visit slightly in the off-season..).

* Day 27: Milan (250km)

From Cinque Terre we followed the coast north-west and then slightly inland to Rivarola, from which we took the [SS586], [SP586R] and the [SS45] north-east to Piacenza. The whole region consists of low, [forested mountains](https://imgur.com/a/ly15ci7) and in-between the villages it feels eerily quiet. We met a handful of Italian biker groups and near Marsaglia came across an accident site where a Street Fighter V4 had struck the front end of an oncoming car. The bike was wrecked and the rider was in obvious distress on the road side, his mates however appeared to have things under control and when we continued along we met the ambulance racing to the scene, coming the other way. When we descended towards the Po valley in the early afternoon the temperature shot up to the high thirties, and the Trebbia river which the road followed roughly north was dotted with parasols and playing children. Just south of Piacenza we visited the [battle memorial](https://imgur.com/a/8wPGRXq) near the location where Hannibal inflicted [the first of his three defeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trebia) against the Romans in 218 BCE. Although clearly marked on the map, the memorial doesn't have a dedicated place to park nor even a plaque or sign explaining what it is. From Piacenza we took the highway to Milan - J. was tired after all the mountain roads and by the extreme heat we faced in the afternoon. Milan was a bit of a surprise in mid-August, we found the city more or less abandoned with barely any traffic in the streets and much of the shops and restaurants closed. We spent the evening with friends, wandering around the 'new' part of town ([Piazza Gau Alente](https://imgur.com/a/pDIf9OC) and surroundings) and the ['tree library'](https://imgur.com/a/asCFhiO) next to it (which is really well done), after which we had an elaborate yet bargain dinner in [a tiny Chinese restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zFT87vWYaqZYtfNN7).

* Day 28,29,30: Davos, Switzerland (800km)

From Milan we rode north to Como, then followed the Swiss [2] and [13] along the valley to Bellinzona and eventually [San Bernardino](https://imgur.com/a/FkSe3sV). It's one of my favorite passes, too narrow for trucks and with a [gorgeous lake](https://imgur.com/a/mMCfKbm) at the top, and even the last stretch of the highway towards it has [bloody hairpins](https://imgur.com/a/POJxDWx)! From here we went along the beautiful Graub√ºndner valleys towards Thusis and eventually Davos. I've been coming to Davos regularly for more than a decade and the high season (winter) prices are legendary, however in late summer everything is decidedly more affordable; we managed to snatch a room in a fancy, old fashioned three-star hotel for just 400 francs for three nights. We had a [gorgeous mountain view](https://imgur.com/a/5aRFAn0) [from our balcony](https://imgur.com/a/Y30ghVG) and breakfast was everything you'd expect from a fancy place! 

The next morning we took off early towards the Fluela, Ofen, Fuorn, [Stelvio](https://imgur.com/a/7F82fiR), [Bernina](https://imgur.com/a/Y51T6Dd), and Albula passes respectively ([clockwise from the top](https://imgur.com/a/HcVHAZs)). A long day of [well-trodden mountain territory for both of us](https://imgur.com/a/JjXiquq), but goddamn if [this](https://imgur.com/a/81VqzaX) isn't what riding is about, I don't know what is. Weather was perfect and J. did extremely well even on the heavy tiger. We even got to a cute [couple picture](https://imgur.com/a/Pjbu5oo) taken! ü•∞

On the second rest day we took it real easy with only a short tour of the [Julier](https://imgur.com/a/QuStcLn) and Fluela passes in the morning, and a short hike and a relaxing swim in the afternoon. It was 28 degrees in Davos which is considered somewhat of a heat wave aroun there.

* Day 31: Freiburg, Germany (300km)

From Davos we took a number of minor (and not always very interesting) roads northeast through Switzerland and the Black Forest past Liechtenstein, St. Gallen, and Waldshut, while stopping in Winterthur for lunch with friends. It was extremely hot once more, and the holiday traffic in the Black Forest was exhausting, bloody campervans everywhere. We were happy to crash with friends after a cold shower, and with a cold beer!

* Day 32: Home (700km)

Straight shot north-west on the Autobahn. No irregularities ;)

## **Epilogue**
***

We got home mid-August filthy and tired after [8300km](https://imgur.com/a/ON68EP3). We spent two days washing, cleaning, and sorting through everything, and on the third day we took the bikes to the [car wash](https://imgur.com/a/fxblwlW) for a good scrub. After that, it was time to return to normal life more or less.

The bikes held up fine, only issues were the sometimes nonfunctional cruise control on the SMT, and the broken rear hugger of the Tiger. The latter drank nearly 4.5L of oil, which is a bit frustrating but unsurprising considering its age. I'm curious to see whether it'll hold up another ~60k til 300 without a major breakdown. I'm also very impressed with the SMT. It's comfortable on longer distances, easy to pack with luggage, but at the same time also light and nimble, and an absolute riot in the mountains.

***Favorite roads:*** (in no particular order)

* [Unnamed road between Paularo and Pontebba in north-eastern Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/24768qrnwdibcr1M8). Narrow and curvy, the tarmac was nonexistent at times but the sweet and quiet alpine landscape and the looming peaks were stunning. Navigation will claim that the road is closed due to a landslide but this has been fixed recently. There's a lovely _[agroturismo](https://imgur.com/a/TWcwzEI)_ halfway for coffee and snacks, be sure to bring cash. You can also cross the unpaved Polentin pass into Austria from there.

* [The R467 in Bosnia between Pijesak and the Serbian border](https://maps.app.goo.gl/joRnQFxbVpc6vhwJ8). Gorgeous green hills interspersed with little lakes and rivers. Extremely quiet, and uhh, there's bears. The whole route felt dreamy.

* [The 111 in the Arcadia, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xhAtjT5vMdVMDfzK6). Endlessly long, very quiet, a mix of green and rocky, and decently surfaced with endless curves and spectacular views. Part of it feel like the Alps almost, with ski resorts and wooden lodges.

* [Unnamed coastal road south of Igoumenitsa, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BXybD55hn3GT9Pot9). Stunning views of the rocky coastline with small forested islands dotted about and Corfu looming in the distance. The hulking ferries chugging along on the horizon really put things into perspective.

* [The SS163 on the Amalfi coast, Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2RU3wuSnz8RKBnvg8). This road is a testament to man's arrogance. Endless tunnels, bridges, and little villages with not a level square meter of soil in sight. Do not attempt with a car.


***Personal notes***

Traveling like this with your partner certainly makes things more interesting, it's far more intense than just living together, because there's never a quiet moment: you're always on the road together, resting, eating, sleeping together. You can't bugger off to spend the evening with friends, you can't isolate yourself with games, a book, or garden work. In that sense it's a great relationship test, and the important part is to communicate about the frustrations that arise, because you'll both be going through them. We did fine overall, but there were certainly difficult days and occasions when I really just wanted to have some time to myself. At the same time you do get to know each other better through such circumstances, and I wouldn't trade that for the world.

If you're ever wondering if motorcycle touring is for you - let this tale be of inspiration? Start small, just a few days here and there, then work your way up. Onroad, offroad, camping, hotels, you can do it in whatever way works for you. Collect maps, bags, accessories, tools, and chase that horizon! It's an intense way to travel, but also one of the best to actually _see_ the places you're going through.

This is a write-up with some pictures of our holiday tour to Crete in summer 2025, we got home just a few weeks ago! I've been riding for more than a decade but my gf, let's call her J., only got her license last year, and two days later we departed for a tour of the Alps. We ended up riding about 4000km through Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and France. Gorgeous, but also well-traveled and well-known territory. 

For this year we wanted to do something a bit more adventurous, and after a lot of deliberation and staring at maps we decided on Crete, because neither of us had been to the Balkans yet, and we wanted to see more of Greece and Italy. We planned, roughly, for 9000km in 5 weeks.

## **Preparations**
***

***Bikes and luggage***

J. really likes the Tiger, and I'd just bought a new SMT in January. When it came to luggage I had a number of bags lying around from my previous trips, and decided to expand the set with a Kriega rackpack. The completed setup was as follows:

* Tiger: 42L top case, 30L Kriega drypack, 10L tank bag. Chain lock wrapped around the rear carrier.
* SMT: Kriega 40L rackpack, Kriega 30L drypack, 5L tank bag. Disc lock in the seat pocket.

The two locks allowed us to quickly [secure the bikes](https://imgur.com/a/KbxDPW7) and helmets anywhere we went. Both bikes also had a bottle holder with a thermos for (cold) drinking water attached to the front crash bars. For each bag we carried a spare strap, as well as some general purpose rokstraps and bungee cords. You never know when something might break, or when stuff falls off and you need to secure it somehow.

We each have a full mesh gear setup: jacket, pants, gloves, and riding sneakers topped off with fitted ear plugs, a buff, and Sena helmet kit. Both of us also carried a light rainjacket, waterproof riding overall, hiking boots, regular light shoes, a sweater, and some light regular clothing. In the tank bag we carried a tourniquet, emergency bandage, pocket knife, lighter, drinking water, some emergency food (energy bars), phone and charger, and miscellaneous stuff like sunglasses, camera, and paper maps. We also had two small first aid kits, a foil blanket, and some regular towels with us.

***Maintenance, spare parts, tools***

The Tiger was sitting at around 230k km and has been burning oil at an accelerating pace. It needs topping up every few days, so we decided to play it safe, and brought a 4L oil can with us, as well as some small spare parts (starter solenoid, sprocket nut and lockwasher). The SMT was brand new with only 9k on it, the main concern being that the 15k service should be done somewhere on the way for warranty purposes. For chain maintenance I carried a 1L bottle of 80w90 gear oil and a brush. We also had [a small toolkit](https://imgur.com/a/0psTdqg) with the basics required to work on the brakes, bodywork, get to the battery and fuses, and make emergency repairs (tape/tiewraps/wire). Both of us have worldwide roadside assistance, and since we weren't planning on straying too far from civilization we didn't carry camping or cooking gear, nor equipment to change tires. While on the road we would grease the chains and give the bikes a good lookover every few days at least.

***Navigation and lodging***

Both bikes have Garmin XTs mounted, and for each day we'd make a GPX in Kurviger and upload it to the navis. We had a general route in mind but the details were usually worked out over dinner the night before with some old-fashioned paper maps and some local information sprinkled in. Apart from the first and the last day we mostly avoided motorways, and on average did about 300km a day. We'd typically ride for 60 - 90 minutes each between breakfast, coffee, lunch, and afternoon drinks, and arrival so about 4 - 6 hours of riding each day. 

When it came to lodging we went with BnB's, apartments, and hotels found through the usual channels. I have done some light camping in the past but never on longer motorcycle trips and never with J., so if we ever wanted to, we'd have to do some practice runs first. We didn't have a strict budget per se, but tried to stay within about ‚Ç¨250 a day on average, including two tanks of fuel.

## **Leg 1: [Netherlands to Macedonia](https://imgur.com/a/EUMKvRV)**
***

* Day 1 and 2: Freiburg, Germany (700km)

We left around 11h00 for an _autobahn_ sit to Freiburg, arriving for dinner with friends of mine who live near the city. I know there's a lot to see in-between: the Ardennes, Luxemburg, the Black Forest, the Vosges.. but we've been to those places many, many times already and when you're on the way south it's preferable to take long strides sometimes. We suffered through heavy rainstorms near Frankfurt but by the time we pulled off the highway two hours later it was warm and dry. The next day we took a bit of a rest and explored the city together with my mates. Freiburg is a large university town with a young vibe and a lovely mix of provincial and cosmopolitan Germany. Worth a stop, if you're ever nearby. 

* Day 3: Lech, Austria (350km)

We took off through the southernmost part of the Black Forest to arrive on the shores of the Bodensee (Lac Konstanz) for a sun-drenched lunch. I'd plotted a route from Bregenz along the [200] and [198] in Tyrol cause I'd never been to that part of Austria yet, and it was pretty decent and a bit quiet. We got some light rain in the afternoon, but generally decent weather. Out hotel for the night was a very cheap but run down classic mountain lodge, with rooms that have been in dire need of an overhaul since about 1995. It seemed to me like the family who owned it was squeezing it for what it was worth without investing anything in the place. [Dinner](https://imgur.com/a/bHbaEXV) and breakfast were decent however, but the wifi and cell reception was nonexistent in the little valley.

* Day 4: Tolmezzo, Italy (350km)

We left in the morning fog towards Imst, a road with great views of the southern Alps across the valley, towards Italy. We took a short bit of highway to get past Innsbruck, then turned south and east to Zell am Ziller and the [Grossglockner](https://imgur.com/a/bVcSklw). I've mostly been to the Swiss and Italian side of the Alps so this famous road was on the to-do list still. We arrived on a weekday just after lunch which meant it was fairly quiet, but I can imagine it being busy and annoying on weekends. The road is great but the toll is outrageous: ‚Ç¨35 per bike. It's worth it, at least for once, because the views and landscape are absolutely stunning. The road was built as a tourist attraction starting in 1930 as it didn't exist as a historical pass or anything, hence the tolls. Once across the GG we went southeast to the beautiful little [Plockenpass into Italy](https://imgur.com/a/YeZ9eFv), and arrived at [our BnB near Tolmezzo](https://imgur.com/a/QdwomvD). From here on the weather was pretty much impeccable for the rest of our trip.

* Day 5: Obrov, Slovenia (350km)

We started with a quiet mountain outing in the morning, towards Paularo and then north over an eerily quiet and narrow road towards the (unpaved) Polentin pass. We didn't take it though, instead continuing east to Pontebba, and then up the Sella Nevea and Predil passes into Slovenia. We followed the [203] and [102] south along the river through countless villages with traffic cameras seemingly every 500 meters. The temperature also built steadily and in the afternoon we were buckling in the 35 degree heat. Took a break near the [Skjocjan Caves](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xMC2N6PriYnVSjrb7) where the Karst landscape has been worn out by rainfall and underground rivers into endless tunnels which at some point collapsed leaving a [giant crater](https://imgur.com/a/g29pmdj) in the landscape, a bizarre and gorgeous sight, but also quiet at this time of day and cool in the forest. We found a gorgeous BnB in the [hills east of Trieste](https://imgur.com/a/A7Dt59x) which included a lovely dinner with local wines, and breakfast.

* Day 6: Bihac, Bosnia and Herzegovina (400km)

This turned out to be one of the more interesting days, cause a lot happened in quick succession. We approached the Adriatic over some beautiful B roads to enjoy morning coffee at the [little boulevard in Bakar](https://imgur.com/a/Uu2Z16G), next to Rijeka. After this we followed the coast, zooming between campers and caravans, with gorgeous views of the sea and numerous islands to our right. At our lunch stop in Senj we were approached by a Dutch couple who just returned from a MotoGymKhana tournament in Zagreb so we spent some time talking bikes with them, and afterwards we went up into the hills towards Dabar and eventualle Zeljava. We saw several 'warning: mines' signs on the side of the road, and in one little village where we stopped for drinks we were greeted by the local car tuning club, bunch of guys with old Audi's and VW's, ogling J., who didn't feel quite at ease. I noticed that several of them had Ustase stickers on their cars (local version of the SS, basically), lovely bunch. Croatia apparently has a bit of a problem with far right extremists. We got the hell outta there as soon as our colas were through. This part of Croatia felt very remote and rough, and although there were plenty of signs advertising apartments and BnB's, there was hardly anyone on the road. Not long after this we arrived at [Zeljava air base](https://imgur.com/a/2USAZA0) which is fairly well known at this point and a nice opportunity for a cheesy picture. [The border with Bosnia](https://imgur.com/a/AdpKuV1) was only a few miles away and was very easy: no inspections, no questions, just a quick glance at our passports and that was it. Immediately afterwards the landscape changed, with occasional [mosques](https://imgur.com/a/QVjhrCU) and orthodox christian churches in the little villages next to the road, old tractors chugging along with carts full of produce, and children playing in the street. One of the staff of our motel in Bihac explained that it was peaceful now, Muslims, Christians, and everyone tolerating each other pretty much. We noticed how the mosque in town _did_ call for prayer like usual but in a rather quiet and short version unlike the minute-long yammering you get in the Middle East, and plenty of restaurants served alcohol. The crowd in the street also seemed varied, could've been anyplace Europe, basically. The town itself was situated along a shallow river with a fairground, restaurants, and bars and loads of people and kids around, it felt very organic and friendly. We had great burgers at a 'wine bar' which turned out to have exactly two kinds of wine, red and white.

* Day 7 and 8: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (300km)

Breakfast was intense: we got eggs, a bunch of baked or steamed vegetables, and no less than three different kinds of sausages as well as bacon and olives, and no coffee (which was off because [Bosnian coffee](https://imgur.com/a/wBJiDYF) in general is quite good). By god did I wish for an espresso and some croissants! We followed the main road along the river all day towards Sarajevo, and saw several more signs indicating mines as well as remnants from the war: numerous buildings, large and small, had bullet holes and even [grenade impacts](https://imgur.com/a/i4z3pxD), which had either been left in place or re-stucced in a different colour for emphasis. Gasoline was only about 1‚Ç¨ per liter which made for easy fueling, and all but the smallest places accepted card payments. We stopped for lunch in Jajce with its [gorgeous waterfalls](https://imgur.com/a/Jo0XbnO), situated among green rolling hills. The roads were generally good and traffic was light. It was quite hot in the afternoon so around Zenica we decided to take the highway for the last hour towards Sarajevo.

The next day we visited one of the [museums](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2JVpHjsi9jetyixZ7) about the siege which was.. a haunting experience. It's truly despicable how the international community sat by and watched while civilians were being starved and shot at daily for nearly four years. We walked around town a good bit and came across numerous monuments and memorials. In the afternoon we took the cable car up to Trebevic hill which gave a great [view of the city](https://imgur.com/a/QIIsjEn) and is the location of the [abandoned bobsled track](https://imgur.com/a/R9kgsk5) from the [1984 winter olympics](https://imgur.com/a/2xMBZj4). Like the rest of Bosnia, Sarajevo was in a reasonably good state and it felt clean, and modern. The old town is extremely touristy with all the garbage trinket shops, ice cream vendors, and tourist traps this brings, but at the same time it maintains a quaint and interesting atmosphere. 

* Day 9: Berane, Montenegro (300km)

About an hour east of Sarajevo we were taking a little roadside break, when suddenly a fluffy little shape walks across the road not 20ft away. I whisper to J. in my mic.. ""_there's a bear cub here, get back on the bike quick and quiet cause we need to go now_"". Really didn't feel like meeting his mom! The [R450] and [R467] feel quiet and remote, and run by some very pretty rocky canyons and little lakes. We crossed into Serbia later morning, just for a short stint cause the [182] goes nowhere except south into Montenegro. Both crossings were extremely quiet and easy without questions or hassle. The [P10] and [E65] south lead through some pretty landscapes, flowing green hills and mountains very much like the past few days, except it had been _desurfaced_ for a distance of nearly 20 miles in anticipation of major repairs/upgrades, so we spent almost an hour driving dead slow along rocky white gravel in a filthy dusty mist thrown up by the cars in front of us. My snot was like clay for hours after this and the bikes looked like they'd been through a [cement](https://imgur.com/a/RXnJg6r) [mixer](https://imgur.com/a/A0iF9OK).

* Day 10: Givgelija, Macedonia (400km)

Our hostel was situated on the ski slopes with a [magnificent breakfast view](https://imgur.com/a/w4JkU1U), after which we took the steep hairpins back down to the main road. We entered Kosovo half an hour later, the border crossing was busier than the others we'd had so far but not much of a hassle. We had to buy temporary insurance worth ‚Ç¨6 per bike since Kosovo is de facto independent from Serbia but not formally recognised by the European insurance companies yet. The [R106] down from the Montegrin mountains onto the Kosovo plain was spectacular with great tarmac, beautiful hairpins, and a sweet view. The central plain south of Pristina was extremely boring and busy and it was crazy hot as well, so we only dipped into the capital briefly for a glance at the Bill Clinton [statue](https://imgur.com/a/O4w0qTJ) (they're grateful to NATO in general and ol' Bill specifically for the 1999 intervention which eventually resulted in their independence) before heading south towards Macedonia. The combination of scorching heat and ferry ticket prices (to Crete) meant that we had to make a bit of speed these days. Highways aren't nearly always boring though, the [E75] southeast of Skopje weaves and bends through a beautiful rocky landscape with the occasional olive grove and winery. It was nice to be able to keep up the speed in the scorching heat. Our place for tonight was the quite luxurious but also very cheap Sky Hotel barely a mile north of the Greek border. We sat on the roof terrace in the still-heavy evening heat enjoying a beer and chatting with the waiter who spoke perfect English and recommended some local dishes to us. One of them seemed a bit like lasagna (oven dish with layers of vegetables, tomatoes, and cheese) however upon my comparison the guy was adamant that I was an idiot and that it was in fact not at all like lasagna.

## **Leg 2: [Greece](https://imgur.com/a/7xJ0zpt)**
***

* Day 11: Kalambaka, Greece (300km)

For most of our time in [Greece](https://imgur.com/a/0fJOzBl) the mid-day temperatures were around 35 degrees and we were stopping every 30-45mins for a drink, and if possible to dunk our buff and gloves in water somewhere which would make the next 30 mins on the bike bearable. This morning we followed the main road south to Thesaloniki and then Katerini, where we turned right into the hills, along the foot of [mount olympos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aGR3VAEcjhqrov846). The inner part of Greece isn't as touristy as the coast and some of the cities, so the roads were fairly quiet, first the [13] and then the [26] and [15] to Kalambaka and [the Meteora](https://imgur.com/a/nnliiNQ). We were absolutely soaking with sweat when we arrived, however the view is.. off this world. I can only imagine the reactions of the first stone-age Greeks as they ventured inland and came across [this landscape](https://imgur.com/a/aZXrn2k) which appears [straight out of a high fantasy series](https://imgur.com/a/hq1yRby). We took a long cold shower then went for a (slow!) walk [around the foot of these hills](https://imgur.com/a/OfmyFEX) (this is funny because I'm a biologist and the sign says MICROBIOLOGIKO) in the evening heat, we'd planned on going a longer circuit but the heat made it impossible. 

* Day 12: Piraeus (350km)

We left very early in the morning to try and beat the some of the worst heat, speeding along the [E65] towards Lamia along a valley which was [a good bit greener](https://imgur.com/a/rxcfHQr) than the rest of Greece, probably due to rain runoff from the surrounding mountains. Giant olive/orange/lime orchards were all over the place and the road was flanked by ancient rock quarries and a snaking railway that seemed rather newly built. Once up in the hills south of Lamia the temperature dropped somewhat and we got to take a number of [remote little roads](https://imgur.com/a/6sJlzDQ)(not pictured: 42 degrees celsius!) full of hairpins which ran straight through villages with very surprised looking old Greek men on the road side. We had a long [lunch and a swim in Antikyra](https://imgur.com/a/t4b6gv7), and around 15h00 we wetted our gear once again to brace against the stifling heat on the road to Athens. We had planned for a curvy coastal road but we were so tired and fed up with the heat that we decided to stick to the main roads and even took a bit of highway. Interesting to note is that the Greek toll system is very different from the French/Spanish/Italian ones, in the sense that you don't take a ticket and pay when you leave the road, but you just stop at a toll station every 10-20km on the road and pay directly for that distance. Oftentimes it was no more than 50 cents, occasionally 1 or 2 euro's. 

Athens and the surroundings suffer from a terrible case of urban heat syndrome and evening traffic made it all the worse, it was close to 40 degrees on the main road into Piraeus. We were splitting at a decent pace between the commuters but still local bikes and scooters zoomed around us every which way.

* Day 13 and 14: Matala (100km)

We boarded the ferry [Piraeus -> Heraklion](https://imgur.com/a/tZ4ERL7) around 08h30 with a large backpack full of groceries: water, bread, olives, snacks, some fruit, etc. The onboard offerings are usually overpriced medium quality so it's best to bring your own. We picked a nice spot in the shade on the rear deck and spent the day gazing our over the mediterranean, reading, or sipping coffee (the only thing worth buying from the bar, basically). At one point I though I saw some dolphins in the distance but was unable to verify :(

Crete is a little cooler than the mainland which felt like a welcome change, and the ride south across the island to [Matala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matala,_Crete) was uneventful. We found a nice little guest house with airconditioning and a good place to park, so all was well. We took a rest the next day, went [hiking](https://imgur.com/a/RlxikkH), swimming, enjoyed a long seaside lunch followed by a siesta, and sauntered along the little town which while rather touristy on the hand, was also small enough to maintain a distinct aura of local innocence on the other. There's a cute little harbour with a small beach and beautiful [rock formations](https://imgur.com/a/Dgdoc9p) right next to it, [hippie graffiti and art](https://img1.vakantio.de/uploads/f83fb11285e4535ba04c81438f9a2a7d_large.avif), as well as a lot of small bars and restaurants. Not a bad place for a break!

* Day 15 and 16: Rethymno (350km)

We rode along the rocky coastal road westwards towards Selia and Komitades, and then north and slightly easy back to Rethymno. The mountains sometimes seem to rise straight from the sea! We passed through [several](https://imgur.com/a/J2PUouS) [rocky gorges](https://imgur.com/a/3a9kxWQ) where all life had gone grey and yellow except right next to what used to be the stream. Even insects were few and far between since it hadn't rained in over a month with consistent 30-degree temperatures. The southern coast is rather quiet with only the occasional tour bus going to the gorges, on the other hand the northern coast is extremely touristy and rather bland. Endless hotels, resorts, restaurants and a huge traffic jam all the way in between. Rethymno itself has a decent boulevard and harbour but the town itself is inundated with tourists and it's difficult to find affordable and authentic places to eat and shop. It's basically the same souvenir store with fridge magnets, coffee cups, and dresses copy-pasted a few hundred times. 

We took a bit of a rest day after this, J. was a bit tired so she hopped on the back of the SMT and we drove a bit west to see the [ruins of Aptera](https://imgur.com/a/BtdR5As) and then went for lunch + a swim in the town of Stavros just north of Chania. Turned out to have been the exact beach location used in the movie [Zorba the Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorba_the_Greek_\(film\)). 

* Day 17: Heraklion (100km)

We left early in the morning because I had an appointment with the KTM garage in Heraklion - it was sitting at nearly 14.000km and the 15k service was near. Napels might also have been an option but that might have been stretching it. Any way we arrived at the shop around 10h00 to find all the lifts occupied and nobody in a rush to help despite the appointment. We had to wait a good half hour before the lead mechanic was finished and told us it'd take at least two hours for the oil change and minor checks, so we spent the rest of the morning and lunch at a nearby caf√© under the blissful air conditiong. We had planned to go for a longer ride in the afternoon towards Arkalohchori but the long wait and the stifling heat killed the mood, so we went for an early check in at our hotel, spending the rest of the afternoon and evening strolling around town, visiting museums and writing postcards. The [Heraklion Archaological Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ficYA6SQZFYV2udB8) was sweet, they had [so much stuff](https://imgur.com/a/3fwLREq) that they could easily split into five different museums each with a proper collection!

* Day 18: Nafplion (200km)

The return [ferry to Piraeus](https://imgur.com/a/BQbSMtZ) left at 09h00 and we were well-prepared again with our bag of groceries. In retrospect it would've been preferable to stay a few more days on Crete considering the costs of the ferry (‚Ç¨120 for a one-way for two pax and two bikes), and I wouldn't have minded spending another day or two in Matala and having another day for a bike trip either to the eastern or western point of the island. But we had a wee bit of a schedule to keep and were also dependent on the Igoumenitsa - Brindisi ferry which was far more expensive and this required careful planning.

It was hot again in Piraeus late afternoon, so we quickly jumped on the bikes and made our way across the Isthmus of Corinth towards Nafplion in the peloponnese. A gorgeous old town with a touristy aftertaste, Nafplion has been an important harbour since Roman times, with several large fortresses either [in the harbour](https://imgur.com/a/tqqWHGm) or [on the hills](https://imgur.com/a/aQFQjTF) right behind it.

* Day 19: Vonitsa (350km)

From Nafplion we drove around the bay to Lerna and then west into the hills of the Arcadia, already famous in ancient times for its 'untouched' landscape. We followed the [7], [111] and the [33] west, then turned north near Agria Triade, towards Patras. It was at this point that the rear hugger of the Tiger broke and started rattling like crazy. We got lucky at one of the gas stations when the clerk had [a drill I could borrow](https://imgur.com/a/rbKit10), and I fixed it with a nice [tiewrap stitch](https://imgur.com/a/DUOX0wB). It was also during this day that J. cried out in pain at some point, when a hornet the size of a fist took a bite out of her leg, right through her mesh suit. Even three weeks later the damn wound hasn't healed completely. It doesn't sound like much but this was one of my favorite days in Greece since it was quiet, green, not _too_ hot in the mountains, and just hours and hours of endless curves and pretty landscapes. From Patras we went north to the little peninsula of Aitoliko which is an extremely run-down town which to be honest should have been a tourist hotspot, considering the location on the coast, and the views.

## **Leg 3: [Italy and back home](https://imgur.com/a/4IfzBCs)**
***

* Day 20: Brindisi, Italy (150km)

Our [ferry to Italy](https://imgur.com/a/SAti71g) left at 14h00 only, so we took a slow morning with breakfast along the shores of the Ambracian gulf, near the location where in 31 BCE Octavian (the later emperor Caesar Augustus) with a little help from Marcus Agrippa [defeated the forces of Marc Antony and Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium), effectively becoming sole ruler of the mediterranean and shaping Europe for the ages. From there we took the sweet coastal road past Lichnos and Sivota and arrived in Igoumenitsa in time for some lunch and grocery shopping. The ferry itself was uneventful and our hostel for the night was a rundown place so I won't waste time on that.

* Day 21 and 22: Sorrento (450km)

We left at 07h00 and made our way along the [E90] to Taranto for breakfast. This part of Apulia is flat with mainly agriculture and a lot of abandoned and ruined farmhouses and industry. Even the roadside is filthy with trash dumped everywhere. After a sweet Italian breakfast and some cappuchinos with a view of the Taranto harbour, we continued north-west into the hills along the [E847], [SP103] and [SS92], coming by some some pretty historical villages (and ruins) such as Pisticci, [Craco](https://imgur.com/a/nIPOew8), and Stigliano. Once near Potenza it was getting awfully hot again so from here on we stuck to the main roads before arriving at the stunning [Amalfi coast](https://imgur.com/a/ciBQWU6) near Salerno. If you're ever in the neighbourhood, go here, rent a bike, and drive the [SS163] here!

The next day we drove down to the Sorrento harbour in [the local biker outfit](https://imgur.com/a/czTDXNu), and took the ferry into Napoli harbour and played tourist for a bit, before taking the train back in the evening. We had real nice BnB on a hill near Vico Equense which offered [sweet views of Napoli bay and the Visuvius](https://imgur.com/a/pzEu5FT)!

* Day 23: Cassino (300km)

We followed the coast towards Pompeii then took a number of quiet mountain roads (which I can't find on the map for the life of me) towards Avellino and Benevento. From there we stuck to the hills all the way towards Piedimonte, Pietrovairano with it's beautiful (and only very recently discovered) [Roman theatre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/imfMfi2Rqo1PftUc8), and eventually Cassino where drove up all the way to [the abbey](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zNfdCF5skY5B63dh6) for a stroll. The abbey was completely destroyed by the USAF in 1944 (along with several hundred refugees sheltering) because intel indicated that the Germans were using it as an observation post (which was false). Look up [the battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino) if you're even remotely interested in history!

* Day 24: Trasimene (350km)

From Cassino we headed to the coast near Latina to circumvent Rome as much as possible (already been there - not keen on traffic!) and had coffee on the beach near the Fiumichino airport. From there we followed the coast all the way to Tarquinia where we turned right towards Viterbo, the ancient [Papal residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Popes_in_Viterbo), then continued inland along the highway towards lake Trasimene, the location of [the second of Hannibals' stunning victories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Trasimene) against the Romans during the second Punic war. The landscape in this part of Italy is green rolling hills, much unlike the dry near-desert of the south. We found an [old-fashioned but affordable](https://imgur.com/a/BtChvyA) and friendly hotel a little ways away from the lake shore.

* Day 25 and 26: Cinque Terre (350km)

From Trasimene we crossed Tuscany towards Siena en Pontedera, a hypertouristic region but also well deserved. The landscape is a characteristic greenish/brown dotted with cypress-lined country lanes, orchards and vineyards, and the architecture is [extremely picturesque](https://iconiclife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tuscany-Italy-countryside.jpg). We went by the iconic [Gladiator filming location](https://imgur.com/a/BEfa0u6) and definitely weren't the only one in line. Foreign license plates are everywhere and traffic in the bigger towns is super busy. There's also wine-tastings advertised every couple miles at least so being on the road here in the late afternoon carries a bit of risk no doubt. Lastly we took a wee bit of highway to La Spezia since it was, again, stupid hot, and once there turned onto the hills just behind Cinque Terre to reach Manarola, our stay for tonight. CT is one of the most touristic places in Italy ([and well-deserved tbh](https://imgur.com/a/CJP7UUv)), and the most iconic five towns are difficult to reach by vehicle, we had to [park nearly a mile outside the little town along the road](https://imgur.com/a/fuLzsrl) and carry our luggage all the way. We managed to find an affordable BnB with a _great_ breakfast for just over ‚Ç¨100 a night; most other places were more than twice as expensive.

The day after we took a nice lazy rest, went swimming in the [little rocky harbour](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bbcf00a9b8fe874ed2f03d0/75b3da41-f663-4d86-9225-4c1bba64f00e/cinque-terre-manarola.jpg?format=2500w), took the train to nearby [Vernazza](https://imgur.com/a/x51YTg6) (absolute _packed_ with tourists: American, Chinese, German mostly it seemed), had an expensive but lovely lunch, and then boated back to Manarola. CT is expensive in the main season but [the coast is stunning](https://imgur.com/a/BwzCJ7X) so if you're ever around and can find a decently-priced place to stay (or simply visit slightly in the off-season..).

* Day 27: Milan (250km)

From Cinque Terre we followed the coast north-west and then slightly inland to Rivarola, from which we took the [SS586], [SP586R] and the [SS45] north-east to Piacenza. The whole region consists of low, [forested mountains](https://imgur.com/a/ly15ci7) and in-between the villages it feels eerily quiet. We met a handful of Italian biker groups and near Marsaglia came across an accident site where a Street Fighter V4 had struck the front end of an oncoming car. The bike was wrecked and the rider was in obvious distress on the road side, his mates however appeared to have things under control and when we continued along we met the ambulance racing to the scene, coming the other way. When we descended towards the Po valley in the early afternoon the temperature shot up to the high thirties, and the Trebbia river which the road followed roughly north was dotted with parasols and playing children. Just south of Piacenza we visited the [battle memorial](https://imgur.com/a/8wPGRXq) near the location where Hannibal inflicted [the first of his three defeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trebia) against the Romans in 218 BCE. Although clearly marked on the map, the memorial doesn't have a dedicated place to park nor even a plaque or sign explaining what it is. From Piacenza we took the highway to Milan - J. was tired after all the mountain roads and by the extreme heat we faced in the afternoon. Milan was a bit of a surprise in mid-August, we found the city more or less abandoned with barely any traffic in the streets and much of the shops and restaurants closed. We spent the evening with friends, wandering around the 'new' part of town ([Piazza Gau Alente](https://imgur.com/a/pDIf9OC) and surroundings) and the ['tree library'](https://imgur.com/a/asCFhiO) next to it (which is really well done), after which we had an elaborate yet bargain dinner in [a tiny Chinese restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zFT87vWYaqZYtfNN7).

* Day 28,29,30: Davos, Switzerland (800km)

From Milan we rode north to Como, then followed the Swiss [2] and [13] along the valley to Bellinzona and eventually [San Bernardino](https://imgur.com/a/FkSe3sV). It's one of my favorite passes, too narrow for trucks and with a [gorgeous lake](https://imgur.com/a/mMCfKbm) at the top, and even the last stretch of the highway towards it has [bloody hairpins](https://imgur.com/a/POJxDWx)! From here we went along the beautiful Graub√ºndner valleys towards Thusis and eventually Davos. I've been coming to Davos regularly for more than a decade and the high season (winter) prices are legendary, however in late summer everything is decidedly more affordable; we managed to snatch a room in a fancy, old fashioned three-star hotel for just 400 francs for three nights. We had a [gorgeous mountain view](https://imgur.com/a/5aRFAn0) [from our balcony](https://imgur.com/a/Y30ghVG) and breakfast was everything you'd expect from a fancy place! 

The next morning we took off early towards the Fluela, Ofen, Fuorn, [Stelvio](https://imgur.com/a/7F82fiR), [Bernina](https://imgur.com/a/Y51T6Dd), and Albula passes respectively ([clockwise from the top](https://imgur.com/a/HcVHAZs)). A long day of [well-trodden mountain territory for both of us](https://imgur.com/a/JjXiquq), but goddamn if [this](https://imgur.com/a/81VqzaX) isn't what riding is about, I don't know what is. Weather was perfect and J. did extremely well even on the heavy tiger. We even got to a cute [couple picture](https://imgur.com/a/Pjbu5oo) taken! ü•∞

On the second rest day we took it real easy with only a short tour of the [Julier](https://imgur.com/a/QuStcLn) and Fluela passes in the morning, and a short hike and a relaxing swim in the afternoon. It was 28 degrees in Davos which is considered somewhat of a heat wave aroun there.

* Day 31: Freiburg, Germany (300km)

From Davos we took a number of minor (and not always very interesting) roads northeast through Switzerland and the Black Forest past Liechtenstein, St. Gallen, and Waldshut, while stopping in Winterthur for lunch with friends. It was extremely hot once more, and the holiday traffic in the Black Forest was exhausting, bloody campervans everywhere. We were happy to crash with friends after a cold shower, and with a cold beer!

* Day 32: Home (700km)

Straight shot north-west on the Autobahn. No irregularities ;)

## **Epilogue**
***

We got home mid-August filthy and tired after [8300km](https://imgur.com/a/ON68EP3). We spent two days washing, cleaning, and sorting through everything, and on the third day we took the bikes to the [car wash](https://imgur.com/a/fxblwlW) for a good scrub. After that, it was time to return to normal life more or less.

The bikes held up fine, only issues were the sometimes nonfunctional cruise control on the SMT, and the broken rear hugger of the Tiger. The latter drank nearly 4.5L of oil, which is a bit frustrating but unsurprising considering its age. I'm curious to see whether it'll hold up another ~60k til 300 without a major breakdown. I'm also very impressed with the SMT. It's comfortable on longer distances, easy to pack with luggage, but at the same time also light and nimble, and an absolute riot in the mountains.

***Favorite roads:*** (in no particular order)

* [Unnamed road between Paularo and Pontebba in north-eastern Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/24768qrnwdibcr1M8). Narrow and curvy, the tarmac was nonexistent at times but the sweet and quiet alpine landscape and the looming peaks were stunning. Navigation will claim that the road is closed due to a landslide but this has been fixed recently. There's a lovely _[agroturismo](https://imgur.com/a/TWcwzEI)_ halfway for coffee and snacks, be sure to bring cash. You can also cross the unpaved Polentin pass into Austria from there.

* [The R467 in Bosnia between Pijesak and the Serbian border](https://maps.app.goo.gl/joRnQFxbVpc6vhwJ8). Gorgeous green hills interspersed with little lakes and rivers. Extremely quiet, and uhh, there's bears. The whole route felt dreamy.

* [The 111 in the Arcadia, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xhAtjT5vMdVMDfzK6). Endlessly long, very quiet, a mix of green and rocky, and decently surfaced with endless curves and spectacular views. Part of it feel like the Alps almost, with ski resorts and wooden lodges.

* [Unnamed coastal road south of Igoumenitsa, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BXybD55hn3GT9Pot9). Stunning views of the rocky coastline with small forested islands dotted about and Corfu looming in the distance. The hulking ferries chugging along on the horizon really put things into perspective.

* [The SS163 on the Amalfi coast, Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2RU3wuSnz8RKBnvg8). This road is a testament to man's arrogance. Endless tunnels, bridges, and little villages with not a level square meter of soil in sight. Do not attempt with a car.


***Personal notes***

Traveling like this with your partner certainly makes things more interesting, it's far more intense than just living together, because there's never a quiet moment: you're always on the road together, resting, eating, sleeping together. You can't bugger off to spend the evening with friends, you can't isolate yourself with games, a book, or garden work. In that sense it's a great relationship test, and the important part is to communicate about the frustrations that arise, because you'll both be going through them. We did fine overall, but there were certainly difficult days and occasions when I really just wanted to have some time to myself. At the same time you do get to know each other better through such circumstances, and I wouldn't trade that for the world.

If you're ever wondering if motorcycle touring is for you - let this tale be of inspiration? Start small, just a few days here and there, then work your way up. Onroad, offroad, camping, hotels, you can do it in whatever way works for you. Collect maps, bags, accessories, tools, and chase that horizon! It's an intense way to travel, but also one of the best to actually _see_ the places you're going through.

This is a write-up with some pictures of our holiday tour to Crete in summer 2025, we got home just a few weeks ago! I've been riding for more than a decade but my gf, let's call her J., only got her license last year, and two days later we departed for a tour of the Alps. We ended up riding about 4000km through Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and France. Gorgeous, but also well-traveled and well-known territory. 

For this year we wanted to do something a bit more adventurous, and after a lot of deliberation and staring at maps we decided on Crete, because neither of us had been to the Balkans yet, and we wanted to see more of Greece and Italy. We planned, roughly, for 9000km in 5 weeks.

## **Preparations**
***

***Bikes and luggage***

J. really likes the Tiger, and I'd just bought a new SMT in January. When it came to luggage I had a number of bags lying around from my previous trips, and decided to expand the set with a Kriega rackpack. The completed setup was as follows:

* Tiger: 42L top case, 30L Kriega drypack, 10L tank bag. Chain lock wrapped around the rear carrier.
* SMT: Kriega 40L rackpack, Kriega 30L drypack, 5L tank bag. Disc lock in the seat pocket.

The two locks allowed us to quickly [secure the bikes](https://imgur.com/a/KbxDPW7) and helmets anywhere we went. Both bikes also had a bottle holder with a thermos for (cold) drinking water attached to the front crash bars. For each bag we carried a spare strap, as well as some general purpose rokstraps and bungee cords. You never know when something might break, or when stuff falls off and you need to secure it somehow.

We each have a full mesh gear setup: jacket, pants, gloves, and riding sneakers topped off with fitted ear plugs, a buff, and Sena helmet kit. Both of us also carried a light rainjacket, waterproof riding overall, hiking boots, regular light shoes, a sweater, and some light regular clothing. In the tank bag we carried a tourniquet, emergency bandage, pocket knife, lighter, drinking water, some emergency food (energy bars), phone and charger, and miscellaneous stuff like sunglasses, camera, and paper maps. We also had two small first aid kits, a foil blanket, and some regular towels with us.

***Maintenance, spare parts, tools***

The Tiger was sitting at around 230k km and has been burning oil at an accelerating pace. It needs topping up every few days, so we decided to play it safe, and brought a 4L oil can with us, as well as some small spare parts (starter solenoid, sprocket nut and lockwasher). The SMT was brand new with only 9k on it, the main concern being that the 15k service should be done somewhere on the way for warranty purposes. For chain maintenance I carried a 1L bottle of 80w90 gear oil and a brush. We also had [a small toolkit](https://imgur.com/a/0psTdqg) with the basics required to work on the brakes, bodywork, get to the battery and fuses, and make emergency repairs (tape/tiewraps/wire). Both of us have worldwide roadside assistance, and since we weren't planning on straying too far from civilization we didn't carry camping or cooking gear, nor equipment to change tires. While on the road we would grease the chains and give the bikes a good lookover every few days at least.

***Navigation and lodging***

Both bikes have Garmin XTs mounted, and for each day we'd make a GPX in Kurviger and upload it to the navis. We had a general route in mind but the details were usually worked out over dinner the night before with some old-fashioned paper maps and some local information sprinkled in. Apart from the first and the last day we mostly avoided motorways, and on average did about 300km a day. We'd typically ride for 60 - 90 minutes each between breakfast, coffee, lunch, and afternoon drinks, and arrival so about 4 - 6 hours of riding each day. 

When it came to lodging we went with BnB's, apartments, and hotels found through the usual channels. I have done some light camping in the past but never on longer motorcycle trips and never with J., so if we ever wanted to, we'd have to do some practice runs first. We didn't have a strict budget per se, but tried to stay within about ‚Ç¨250 a day on average, including two tanks of fuel.

## **Leg 1: [Netherlands to Macedonia](https://imgur.com/a/EUMKvRV)**
***

* Day 1 and 2: Freiburg, Germany (700km)

We left around 11h00 for an _autobahn_ sit to Freiburg, arriving for dinner with friends of mine who live near the city. I know there's a lot to see in-between: the Ardennes, Luxemburg, the Black Forest, the Vosges.. but we've been to those places many, many times already and when you're on the way south it's preferable to take long strides sometimes. We suffered through heavy rainstorms near Frankfurt but by the time we pulled off the highway two hours later it was warm and dry. The next day we took a bit of a rest and explored the city together with my mates. Freiburg is a large university town with a young vibe and a lovely mix of provincial and cosmopolitan Germany. Worth a stop, if you're ever nearby. 

* Day 3: Lech, Austria (350km)

We took off through the southernmost part of the Black Forest to arrive on the shores of the Bodensee (Lac Konstanz) for a sun-drenched lunch. I'd plotted a route from Bregenz along the [200] and [198] in Tyrol cause I'd never been to that part of Austria yet, and it was pretty decent and a bit quiet. We got some light rain in the afternoon, but generally decent weather. Out hotel for the night was a very cheap but run down classic mountain lodge, with rooms that have been in dire need of an overhaul since about 1995. It seemed to me like the family who owned it was squeezing it for what it was worth without investing anything in the place. [Dinner](https://imgur.com/a/bHbaEXV) and breakfast were decent however, but the wifi and cell reception was nonexistent in the little valley.

* Day 4: Tolmezzo, Italy (350km)

We left in the morning fog towards Imst, a road with great views of the southern Alps across the valley, towards Italy. We took a short bit of highway to get past Innsbruck, then turned south and east to Zell am Ziller and the [Grossglockner](https://imgur.com/a/bVcSklw). I've mostly been to the Swiss and Italian side of the Alps so this famous road was on the to-do list still. We arrived on a weekday just after lunch which meant it was fairly quiet, but I can imagine it being busy and annoying on weekends. The road is great but the toll is outrageous: ‚Ç¨35 per bike. It's worth it, at least for once, because the views and landscape are absolutely stunning. The road was built as a tourist attraction starting in 1930 as it didn't exist as a historical pass or anything, hence the tolls. Once across the GG we went southeast to the beautiful little [Plockenpass into Italy](https://imgur.com/a/YeZ9eFv), and arrived at [our BnB near Tolmezzo](https://imgur.com/a/QdwomvD). From here on the weather was pretty much impeccable for the rest of our trip.

* Day 5: Obrov, Slovenia (350km)

We started with a quiet mountain outing in the morning, towards Paularo and then north over an eerily quiet and narrow road towards the (unpaved) Polentin pass. We didn't take it though, instead continuing east to Pontebba, and then up the Sella Nevea and Predil passes into Slovenia. We followed the [203] and [102] south along the river through countless villages with traffic cameras seemingly every 500 meters. The temperature also built steadily and in the afternoon we were buckling in the 35 degree heat. Took a break near the [Skjocjan Caves](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xMC2N6PriYnVSjrb7) where the Karst landscape has been worn out by rainfall and underground rivers into endless tunnels which at some point collapsed leaving a [giant crater](https://imgur.com/a/g29pmdj) in the landscape, a bizarre and gorgeous sight, but also quiet at this time of day and cool in the forest. We found a gorgeous BnB in the [hills east of Trieste](https://imgur.com/a/A7Dt59x) which included a lovely dinner with local wines, and breakfast.

* Day 6: Bihac, Bosnia and Herzegovina (400km)

This turned out to be one of the more interesting days, cause a lot happened in quick succession. We approached the Adriatic over some beautiful B roads to enjoy morning coffee at the [little boulevard in Bakar](https://imgur.com/a/Uu2Z16G), next to Rijeka. After this we followed the coast, zooming between campers and caravans, with gorgeous views of the sea and numerous islands to our right. At our lunch stop in Senj we were approached by a Dutch couple who just returned from a MotoGymKhana tournament in Zagreb so we spent some time talking bikes with them, and afterwards we went up into the hills towards Dabar and eventualle Zeljava. We saw several 'warning: mines' signs on the side of the road, and in one little village where we stopped for drinks we were greeted by the local car tuning club, bunch of guys with old Audi's and VW's, ogling J., who didn't feel quite at ease. I noticed that several of them had Ustase stickers on their cars (local version of the SS, basically), lovely bunch. Croatia apparently has a bit of a problem with far right extremists. We got the hell outta there as soon as our colas were through. This part of Croatia felt very remote and rough, and although there were plenty of signs advertising apartments and BnB's, there was hardly anyone on the road. Not long after this we arrived at [Zeljava air base](https://imgur.com/a/2USAZA0) which is fairly well known at this point and a nice opportunity for a cheesy picture. [The border with Bosnia](https://imgur.com/a/AdpKuV1) was only a few miles away and was very easy: no inspections, no questions, just a quick glance at our passports and that was it. Immediately afterwards the landscape changed, with occasional [mosques](https://imgur.com/a/QVjhrCU) and orthodox christian churches in the little villages next to the road, old tractors chugging along with carts full of produce, and children playing in the street. One of the staff of our motel in Bihac explained that it was peaceful now, Muslims, Christians, and everyone tolerating each other pretty much. We noticed how the mosque in town _did_ call for prayer like usual but in a rather quiet and short version unlike the minute-long yammering you get in the Middle East, and plenty of restaurants served alcohol. The crowd in the street also seemed varied, could've been anyplace Europe, basically. The town itself was situated along a shallow river with a fairground, restaurants, and bars and loads of people and kids around, it felt very organic and friendly. We had great burgers at a 'wine bar' which turned out to have exactly two kinds of wine, red and white.

* Day 7 and 8: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (300km)

Breakfast was intense: we got eggs, a bunch of baked or steamed vegetables, and no less than three different kinds of sausages as well as bacon and olives, and no coffee (which was off because [Bosnian coffee](https://imgur.com/a/wBJiDYF) in general is quite good). By god did I wish for an espresso and some croissants! We followed the main road along the river all day towards Sarajevo, and saw several more signs indicating mines as well as remnants from the war: numerous buildings, large and small, had bullet holes and even [grenade impacts](https://imgur.com/a/i4z3pxD), which had either been left in place or re-stucced in a different colour for emphasis. Gasoline was only about 1‚Ç¨ per liter which made for easy fueling, and all but the smallest places accepted card payments. We stopped for lunch in Jajce with its [gorgeous waterfalls](https://imgur.com/a/Jo0XbnO), situated among green rolling hills. The roads were generally good and traffic was light. It was quite hot in the afternoon so around Zenica we decided to take the highway for the last hour towards Sarajevo.

The next day we visited one of the [museums](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2JVpHjsi9jetyixZ7) about the siege which was.. a haunting experience. It's truly despicable how the international community sat by and watched while civilians were being starved and shot at daily for nearly four years. We walked around town a good bit and came across numerous monuments and memorials. In the afternoon we took the cable car up to Trebevic hill which gave a great [view of the city](https://imgur.com/a/QIIsjEn) and is the location of the [abandoned bobsled track](https://imgur.com/a/R9kgsk5) from the [1984 winter olympics](https://imgur.com/a/2xMBZj4). Like the rest of Bosnia, Sarajevo was in a reasonably good state and it felt clean, and modern. The old town is extremely touristy with all the garbage trinket shops, ice cream vendors, and tourist traps this brings, but at the same time it maintains a quaint and interesting atmosphere. 

* Day 9: Berane, Montenegro (300km)

About an hour east of Sarajevo we were taking a little roadside break, when suddenly a fluffy little shape walks across the road not 20ft away. I whisper to J. in my mic.. ""_there's a bear cub here, get back on the bike quick and quiet cause we need to go now_"". Really didn't feel like meeting his mom! The [R450] and [R467] feel quiet and remote, and run by some very pretty rocky canyons and little lakes. We crossed into Serbia later morning, just for a short stint cause the [182] goes nowhere except south into Montenegro. Both crossings were extremely quiet and easy without questions or hassle. The [P10] and [E65] south lead through some pretty landscapes, flowing green hills and mountains very much like the past few days, except it had been _desurfaced_ for a distance of nearly 20 miles in anticipation of major repairs/upgrades, so we spent almost an hour driving dead slow along rocky white gravel in a filthy dusty mist thrown up by the cars in front of us. My snot was like clay for hours after this and the bikes looked like they'd been through a [cement](https://imgur.com/a/RXnJg6r) [mixer](https://imgur.com/a/A0iF9OK).

* Day 10: Givgelija, Macedonia (400km)

Our hostel was situated on the ski slopes with a [magnificent breakfast view](https://imgur.com/a/w4JkU1U), after which we took the steep hairpins back down to the main road. We entered Kosovo half an hour later, the border crossing was busier than the others we'd had so far but not much of a hassle. We had to buy temporary insurance worth ‚Ç¨6 per bike since Kosovo is de facto independent from Serbia but not formally recognised by the European insurance companies yet. The [R106] down from the Montegrin mountains onto the Kosovo plain was spectacular with great tarmac, beautiful hairpins, and a sweet view. The central plain south of Pristina was extremely boring and busy and it was crazy hot as well, so we only dipped into the capital briefly for a glance at the Bill Clinton [statue](https://imgur.com/a/O4w0qTJ) (they're grateful to NATO in general and ol' Bill specifically for the 1999 intervention which eventually resulted in their independence) before heading south towards Macedonia. The combination of scorching heat and ferry ticket prices (to Crete) meant that we had to make a bit of speed these days. Highways aren't nearly always boring though, the [E75] southeast of Skopje weaves and bends through a beautiful rocky landscape with the occasional olive grove and winery. It was nice to be able to keep up the speed in the scorching heat. Our place for tonight was the quite luxurious but also very cheap Sky Hotel barely a mile north of the Greek border. We sat on the roof terrace in the still-heavy evening heat enjoying a beer and chatting with the waiter who spoke perfect English and recommended some local dishes to us. One of them seemed a bit like lasagna (oven dish with layers of vegetables, tomatoes, and cheese) however upon my comparison the guy was adamant that I was an idiot and that it was in fact not at all like lasagna.

* Day 11: Kalambaka, Greece (300km)

For most of our time in [Greece](https://imgur.com/a/0fJOzBl) the mid-day temperatures were around 35 degrees and we were stopping every 30-45mins for a drink, and if possible to dunk our buff and gloves in water somewhere which would make the next 30 mins on the bike bearable. This morning we followed the main road south to Thesaloniki and then Katerini, where we turned right into the hills, along the foot of [mount olympos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aGR3VAEcjhqrov846). The inner part of Greece isn't as touristy as the coast and some of the cities, so the roads were fairly quiet, first the [13] and then the [26] and [15] to Kalambaka and [the Meteora](https://imgur.com/a/nnliiNQ). We were absolutely soaking with sweat when we arrived, however the view is.. off this world. I can only imagine the reactions of the first stone-age Greeks as they ventured inland and came across [this landscape](https://imgur.com/a/aZXrn2k) which appears [straight out of a high fantasy series](https://imgur.com/a/hq1yRby). We took a long cold shower then went for a (slow!) walk [around the foot of these hills](https://imgur.com/a/OfmyFEX) (this is funny because I'm a biologist and the sign says MICROBIOLOGIKO) in the evening heat, we'd planned on going a longer circuit but the heat made it impossible. 

* Day 12: Piraeus (350km)

We left very early in the morning to try and beat the some of the worst heat, speeding along the [E65] towards Lamia along a valley which was [a good bit greener](https://imgur.com/a/rxcfHQr) than the rest of Greece, probably due to rain runoff from the surrounding mountains. Giant olive/orange/lime orchards were all over the place and the road was flanked by ancient rock quarries and a snaking railway that seemed rather newly built. Once up in the hills south of Lamia the temperature dropped somewhat and we got to take a number of [remote little roads](https://imgur.com/a/6sJlzDQ)(not pictured: 42 degrees celsius!) full of hairpins which ran straight through villages with very surprised looking old Greek men on the road side. We had a long [lunch and a swim in Antikyra](https://imgur.com/a/t4b6gv7), and around 15h00 we wetted our gear once again to brace against the stifling heat on the road to Athens. We had planned for a curvy coastal road but we were so tired and fed up with the heat that we decided to stick to the main roads and even took a bit of highway. Interesting to note is that the Greek toll system is very different from the French/Spanish/Italian ones, in the sense that you don't take a ticket and pay when you leave the road, but you just stop at a toll station every 10-20km on the road and pay directly for that distance. Oftentimes it was no more than 50 cents, occasionally 1 or 2 euro's. 

Athens and the surroundings suffer from a terrible case of urban heat syndrome and evening traffic made it all the worse, it was close to 40 degrees on the main road into Piraeus. We were splitting at a decent pace between the commuters but still local bikes and scooters zoomed around us every which way.

* Day 13 and 14: Matala (100km)

We boarded the ferry [Piraeus -> Heraklion](https://imgur.com/a/tZ4ERL7) around 08h30 with a large backpack full of groceries: water, bread, olives, snacks, some fruit, etc. The onboard offerings are usually overpriced medium quality so it's best to bring your own. We picked a nice spot in the shade on the rear deck and spent the day gazing our over the mediterranean, reading, or sipping coffee (the only thing worth buying from the bar, basically). At one point I though I saw some dolphins in the distance but was unable to verify :(

Crete is a little cooler than the mainland which felt like a welcome change, and the ride south across the island to [Matala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matala,_Crete) was uneventful. We found a nice little guest house with airconditioning and a good place to park, so all was well. We took a rest the next day, went [hiking](https://imgur.com/a/RlxikkH), swimming, enjoyed a long seaside lunch followed by a siesta, and sauntered along the little town which while rather touristy on the hand, was also small enough to maintain a distinct aura of local innocence on the other. There's a cute little harbour with a small beach and beautiful [rock formations](https://imgur.com/a/Dgdoc9p) right next to it, [hippie graffiti and art](https://img1.vakantio.de/uploads/f83fb11285e4535ba04c81438f9a2a7d_large.avif), as well as a lot of small bars and restaurants. Not a bad place for a break!

* Day 15 and 16: Rethymno (350km)

We rode along the rocky coastal road westwards towards Selia and Komitades, and then north and slightly easy back to Rethymno. The mountains sometimes seem to rise straight from the sea! We passed through [several](https://imgur.com/a/J2PUouS) [rocky gorges](https://imgur.com/a/3a9kxWQ) where all life had gone grey and yellow except right next to what used to be the stream. Even insects were few and far between since it hadn't rained in over a month with consistent 30-degree temperatures. The southern coast is rather quiet with only the occasional tour bus going to the gorges, on the other hand the northern coast is extremely touristy and rather bland. Endless hotels, resorts, restaurants and a huge traffic jam all the way in between. Rethymno itself has a decent boulevard and harbour but the town itself is inundated with tourists and it's difficult to find affordable and authentic places to eat and shop. It's basically the same souvenir store with fridge magnets, coffee cups, and dresses copy-pasted a few hundred times. 

We took a bit of a rest day after this, J. was a bit tired so she hopped on the back of the SMT and we drove a bit west to see the [ruins of Aptera](https://imgur.com/a/BtdR5As) and then went for lunch + a swim in the town of Stavros just north of Chania. Turned out to have been the exact beach location used in the movie [Zorba the Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorba_the_Greek_\(film\)). 

* Day 17: Heraklion (100km)

We left early in the morning because I had an appointment with the KTM garage in Heraklion - it was sitting at nearly 14.000km and the 15k service was near. Napels might also have been an option but that might have been stretching it. Any way we arrived at the shop around 10h00 to find all the lifts occupied and nobody in a rush to help despite the appointment. We had to wait a good half hour before the lead mechanic was finished and told us it'd take at least two hours for the oil change and minor checks, so we spent the rest of the morning and lunch at a nearby caf√© under the blissful air conditiong. We had planned to go for a longer ride in the afternoon towards Arkalohchori but the long wait and the stifling heat killed the mood, so we went for an early check in at our hotel, spending the rest of the afternoon and evening strolling around town, visiting museums and writing postcards. The [Heraklion Archaological Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ficYA6SQZFYV2udB8) was sweet, they had [so much stuff](https://imgur.com/a/3fwLREq) that they could easily split into five different museums each with a proper collection!

* Day 18: Nafplion (200km)

The return [ferry to Piraeus](https://imgur.com/a/BQbSMtZ) left at 09h00 and we were well-prepared again with our bag of groceries. In retrospect it would've been preferable to stay a few more days on Crete considering the costs of the ferry (‚Ç¨120 for a one-way for two pax and two bikes), and I wouldn't have minded spending another day or two in Matala and having another day for a bike trip either to the eastern or western point of the island. But we had a wee bit of a schedule to keep and were also dependent on the Igoumenitsa - Brindisi ferry which was far more expensive and this required careful planning.

It was hot again in Piraeus late afternoon, so we quickly jumped on the bikes and made our way across the Isthmus of Corinth towards Nafplion in the peloponnese. A gorgeous old town with a touristy aftertaste, Nafplion has been an important harbour since Roman times, with several large fortresses either [in the harbour](https://imgur.com/a/tqqWHGm) or [on the hills](https://imgur.com/a/aQFQjTF) right behind it.

* Day 19: Vonitsa (350km)

From Nafplion we drove around the bay to Lerna and then west into the hills of the Arcadia, already famous in ancient times for its 'untouched' landscape. We followed the [7], [111] and the [33] west, then turned north near Agria Triade, towards Patras. It was at this point that the rear hugger of the Tiger broke and started rattling like crazy. We got lucky at one of the gas stations when the clerk had [a drill I could borrow](https://imgur.com/a/rbKit10), and I fixed it with a nice [tiewrap stitch](https://imgur.com/a/DUOX0wB). It was also during this day that J. cried out in pain at some point, when a hornet the size of a fist took a bite out of her leg, right through her mesh suit. Even three weeks later the damn wound hasn't healed completely. It doesn't sound like much but this was one of my favorite days in Greece since it was quiet, green, not _too_ hot in the mountains, and just hours and hours of endless curves and pretty landscapes. From Patras we went north to the little peninsula of Aitoliko which is an extremely run-down town which to be honest should have been a tourist hotspot, considering the location on the coast, and the views.

## **Leg 3: [Italy and back home](https://imgur.com/a/4IfzBCs)**
***

* Day 20: Brindisi, Italy (150km)

Our [ferry to Italy](https://imgur.com/a/SAti71g) left at 14h00 only, so we took a slow morning with breakfast along the shores of the Ambracian gulf, near the location where in 31 BCE Octavian (the later emperor Caesar Augustus) with a little help from Marcus Agrippa [defeated the forces of Marc Antony and Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium), effectively becoming sole ruler of the mediterranean and shaping Europe for the ages. From there we took the sweet coastal road past Lichnos and Sivota and arrived in Igoumenitsa in time for some lunch and grocery shopping. The ferry itself was uneventful and our hostel for the night was a rundown place so I won't waste time on that.

* Day 21 and 22: Sorrento (450km)

We left at 07h00 and made our way along the [E90] to Taranto for breakfast. This part of Apulia is flat with mainly agriculture and a lot of abandoned and ruined farmhouses and industry. Even the roadside is filthy with trash dumped everywhere. After a sweet Italian breakfast and some cappuchinos with a view of the Taranto harbour, we continued north-west into the hills along the [E847], [SP103] and [SS92], coming by some some pretty historical villages (and ruins) such as Pisticci, [Craco](https://imgur.com/a/nIPOew8), and Stigliano. Once near Potenza it was getting awfully hot again so from here on we stuck to the main roads before arriving at the stunning [Amalfi coast](https://imgur.com/a/ciBQWU6) near Salerno. If you're ever in the neighbourhood, go here, rent a bike, and drive the [SS163] here!

The next day we drove down to the Sorrento harbour in [the local biker outfit](https://imgur.com/a/czTDXNu), and took the ferry into Napoli harbour and played tourist for a bit, before taking the train back in the evening. We had real nice BnB on a hill near Vico Equense which offered [sweet views of Napoli bay and the Visuvius](https://imgur.com/a/pzEu5FT)!

* Day 23: Cassino (300km)

We followed the coast towards Pompeii then took a number of quiet mountain roads (which I can't find on the map for the life of me) towards Avellino and Benevento. From there we stuck to the hills all the way towards Piedimonte, Pietrovairano with it's beautiful (and only very recently discovered) [Roman theatre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/imfMfi2Rqo1PftUc8), and eventually Cassino where drove up all the way to [the abbey](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zNfdCF5skY5B63dh6) for a stroll. The abbey was completely destroyed by the USAF in 1944 (along with several hundred refugees sheltering) because intel indicated that the Germans were using it as an observation post (which was false). Look up [the battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino) if you're even remotely interested in history!

* Day 24: Trasimene (350km)

From Cassino we headed to the coast near Latina to circumvent Rome as much as possible (already been there - not keen on traffic!) and had coffee on the beach near the Fiumichino airport. From there we followed the coast all the way to Tarquinia where we turned right towards Viterbo, the ancient [Papal residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Popes_in_Viterbo), then continued inland along the highway towards lake Trasimene, the location of [the second of Hannibals' stunning victories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Trasimene) against the Romans during the second Punic war. The landscape in this part of Italy is green rolling hills, much unlike the dry near-desert of the south. We found an [old-fashioned but affordable](https://imgur.com/a/BtChvyA) and friendly hotel a little ways away from the lake shore.

* Day 25 and 26: Cinque Terre (350km)

From Trasimene we crossed Tuscany towards Siena en Pontedera, a hypertouristic region but also well deserved. The landscape is a characteristic greenish/brown dotted with cypress-lined country lanes, orchards and vineyards, and the architecture is [extremely picturesque](https://iconiclife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tuscany-Italy-countryside.jpg). We went by the iconic [Gladiator filming location](https://imgur.com/a/BEfa0u6) and definitely weren't the only one in line. Foreign license plates are everywhere and traffic in the bigger towns is super busy. There's also wine-tastings advertised every couple miles at least so being on the road here in the late afternoon carries a bit of risk no doubt. Lastly we took a wee bit of highway to La Spezia since it was, again, stupid hot, and once there turned onto the hills just behind Cinque Terre to reach Manarola, our stay for tonight. CT is one of the most touristic places in Italy ([and well-deserved tbh](https://imgur.com/a/CJP7UUv)), and the most iconic five towns are difficult to reach by vehicle, we had to [park nearly a mile outside the little town along the road](https://imgur.com/a/fuLzsrl) and carry our luggage all the way. We managed to find an affordable BnB with a _great_ breakfast for just over ‚Ç¨100 a night; most other places were more than twice as expensive.

The day after we took a nice lazy rest, went swimming in the [little rocky harbour](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bbcf00a9b8fe874ed2f03d0/75b3da41-f663-4d86-9225-4c1bba64f00e/cinque-terre-manarola.jpg?format=2500w), took the train to nearby [Vernazza](https://imgur.com/a/x51YTg6) (absolute _packed_ with tourists: American, Chinese, German mostly it seemed), had an expensive but lovely lunch, and then boated back to Manarola. CT is expensive in the main season but [the coast is stunning](https://imgur.com/a/BwzCJ7X) so if you're ever around and can find a decently-priced place to stay (or simply visit slightly in the off-season..).

* Day 27: Milan (250km)

From Cinque Terre we followed the coast north-west and then slightly inland to Rivarola, from which we took the [SS586], [SP586R] and the [SS45] north-east to Piacenza. The whole region consists of low, [forested mountains](https://imgur.com/a/ly15ci7) and in-between the villages it feels eerily quiet. We met a handful of Italian biker groups and near Marsaglia came across an accident site where a Street Fighter V4 had struck the front end of an oncoming car. The bike was wrecked and the rider was in obvious distress on the road side, his mates however appeared to have things under control and when we continued along we met the ambulance racing to the scene, coming the other way. When we descended towards the Po valley in the early afternoon the temperature shot up to the high thirties, and the Trebbia river which the road followed roughly north was dotted with parasols and playing children. Just south of Piacenza we visited the [battle memorial](https://imgur.com/a/8wPGRXq) near the location where Hannibal inflicted [the first of his three defeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trebia) against the Romans in 218 BCE. Although clearly marked on the map, the memorial doesn't have a dedicated place to park nor even a plaque or sign explaining what it is. From Piacenza we took the highway to Milan - J. was tired after all the mountain roads and by the extreme heat we faced in the afternoon. Milan was a bit of a surprise in mid-August, we found the city more or less abandoned with barely any traffic in the streets and much of the shops and restaurants closed. We spent the evening with friends, wandering around the 'new' part of town ([Piazza Gau Alente](https://imgur.com/a/pDIf9OC) and surroundings) and the ['tree library'](https://imgur.com/a/asCFhiO) next to it (which is really well done), after which we had an elaborate yet bargain dinner in [a tiny Chinese restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zFT87vWYaqZYtfNN7).

* Day 28,29,30: Davos, Switzerland (800km)

From Milan we rode north to Como, then followed the Swiss [2] and [13] along the valley to Bellinzona and eventually [San Bernardino](https://imgur.com/a/FkSe3sV). It's one of my favorite passes, too narrow for trucks and with a [gorgeous lake](https://imgur.com/a/mMCfKbm) at the top, and even the last stretch of the highway towards it has [bloody hairpins](https://imgur.com/a/POJxDWx)! From here we went along the beautiful Graub√ºndner valleys towards Thusis and eventually Davos. I've been coming to Davos regularly for more than a decade and the high season (winter) prices are legendary, however in late summer everything is decidedly more affordable; we managed to snatch a room in a fancy, old fashioned three-star hotel for just 400 francs for three nights. We had a [gorgeous mountain view](https://imgur.com/a/5aRFAn0) [from our balcony](https://imgur.com/a/Y30ghVG) and breakfast was everything you'd expect from a fancy place! 

The next morning we took off early towards the Fluela, Ofen, Fuorn, [Stelvio](https://imgur.com/a/7F82fiR), [Bernina](https://imgur.com/a/Y51T6Dd), and Albula passes respectively ([clockwise from the top](https://imgur.com/a/HcVHAZs)). A long day of [well-trodden mountain territory for both of us](https://imgur.com/a/JjXiquq), but goddamn if [this](https://imgur.com/a/81VqzaX) isn't what riding is about, I don't know what is. Weather was perfect and J. did extremely well even on the heavy tiger. We even got to a cute [couple picture](https://imgur.com/a/Pjbu5oo) taken! ü•∞

On the second rest day we took it real easy with only a short tour of the [Julier](https://imgur.com/a/QuStcLn) and Fluela passes in the morning, and a short hike and a relaxing swim in the afternoon. It was 28 degrees in Davos which is considered somewhat of a heat wave aroun there.

* Day 31: Freiburg, Germany (300km)

From Davos we took a number of minor (and not always very interesting) roads northeast through Switzerland and the Black Forest past Liechtenstein, St. Gallen, and Waldshut, while stopping in Winterthur for lunch with friends. It was extremely hot once more, and the holiday traffic in the Black Forest was exhausting, bloody campervans everywhere. We were happy to crash with friends after a cold shower, and with a cold beer!

* Day 32: Home (700km)

Straight shot north-west on the Autobahn. No irregularities ;)

## **Epilogue**
***

We got home mid-August filthy and tired after [8300km](https://imgur.com/a/ON68EP3). We spent two days washing, cleaning, and sorting through everything, and on the third day we took the bikes to the [car wash](https://imgur.com/a/fxblwlW) for a good scrub. After that, it was time to return to normal life more or less.

The bikes held up fine, only issues were the sometimes nonfunctional cruise control on the SMT, and the broken rear hugger of the Tiger. The latter drank nearly 4.5L of oil, which is a bit frustrating but unsurprising considering its age. I'm curious to see whether it'll hold up another ~60k til 300 without a major breakdown. I'm also very impressed with the SMT. It's comfortable on longer distances, easy to pack with luggage, but at the same time also light and nimble, and an absolute riot in the mountains.

***Favorite roads:*** (in no particular order)

* [Unnamed road between Paularo and Pontebba in north-eastern Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/24768qrnwdibcr1M8). Narrow and curvy, the tarmac was nonexistent at times but the sweet and quiet alpine landscape and the looming peaks were stunning. Navigation will claim that the road is closed due to a landslide but this has been fixed recently. There's a lovely _[agroturismo](https://imgur.com/a/TWcwzEI)_ halfway for coffee and snacks, be sure to bring cash. You can also cross the unpaved Polentin pass into Austria from there.

* [The R467 in Bosnia between Pijesak and the Serbian border](https://maps.app.goo.gl/joRnQFxbVpc6vhwJ8). Gorgeous green hills interspersed with little lakes and rivers. Extremely quiet, and uhh, there's bears. The whole route felt dreamy.

* [The 111 in the Arcadia, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xhAtjT5vMdVMDfzK6). Endlessly long, very quiet, a mix of green and rocky, and decently surfaced with endless curves and spectacular views. Part of it feel like the Alps almost, with ski resorts and wooden lodges.

* [Unnamed coastal road south of Igoumenitsa, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BXybD55hn3GT9Pot9). Stunning views of the rocky coastline with small forested islands dotted about and Corfu looming in the distance. The hulking ferries chugging along on the horizon really put things into perspective.

* [The SS163 on the Amalfi coast, Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2RU3wuSnz8RKBnvg8). This road is a testament to man's arrogance. Endless tunnels, bridges, and little villages with not a level square meter of soil in sight. Do not attempt with a car.


***Personal notes***

Traveling like this with your partner certainly makes things more interesting, it's far more intense than just living together, because there's never a quiet moment: you're always on the road together, resting, eating, sleeping together. You can't bugger off to spend the evening with friends, you can't isolate yourself with games, a book, or garden work. In that sense it's a great relationship test, and the important part is to communicate about the frustrations that arise, because you'll both be going through them. We did fine overall, but there were certainly difficult days and occasions when I really just wanted to have some time to myself. At the same time you do get to know each other better through such circumstances, and I wouldn't trade that for the world.

If you're ever wondering if motorcycle touring is for you - let this tale be of inspiration? Start small, just a few days here and there, then work your way up. Onroad, offroad, camping, hotels, you can do it in whatever way works for you. Collect maps, bags, accessories, tools, and chase that horizon! It's an intense way to travel, but also one of the best to actually _see_ the places you're going through.

This is a write-up with some pictures of our holiday tour to Crete in summer 2025, we got home just a few weeks ago! I've been riding for more than a decade but my gf, let's call her J., only got her license last year, and two days later we departed for a tour of the Alps. We ended up riding about 4000km through Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and France. Gorgeous, but also well-traveled and well-known territory. 

For this year we wanted to do something a bit more adventurous, and after a lot of deliberation and staring at maps we decided on Crete, because neither of us had been to the Balkans yet, and we wanted to see more of Greece and Italy. We planned, roughly, for 9000km in 5 weeks.

## **Preparations**
***

***Bikes and luggage***

J. really likes the Tiger, and I'd just bought a new SMT in January. When it came to luggage I had a number of bags lying around from my previous trips, and decided to expand the set with a Kriega rackpack. The completed setup was as follows:

* Tiger: 42L top case, 30L Kriega drypack, 10L tank bag. Chain lock wrapped around the rear carrier.
* SMT: Kriega 40L rackpack, Kriega 30L drypack, 5L tank bag. Disc lock in the seat pocket.

The two locks allowed us to quickly [secure the bikes](https://imgur.com/a/KbxDPW7) and helmets anywhere we went. Both bikes also had a bottle holder with a thermos for (cold) drinking water attached to the front crash bars. For each bag we carried a spare strap, as well as some general purpose rokstraps and bungee cords. You never know when something might break, or when stuff falls off and you need to secure it somehow.

We each have a full mesh gear setup: jacket, pants, gloves, and riding sneakers topped off with fitted ear plugs, a buff, and Sena helmet kit. Both of us also carried a light rainjacket, waterproof riding overall, hiking boots, regular light shoes, a sweater, and some light regular clothing. In the tank bag we carried a tourniquet, emergency bandage, pocket knife, lighter, drinking water, some emergency food (energy bars), phone and charger, and miscellaneous stuff like sunglasses, camera, and paper maps. We also had two small first aid kits, a foil blanket, and some regular towels with us.

***Maintenance, spare parts, tools***

The Tiger was sitting at around 230k km and has been burning oil at an accelerating pace. It needs topping up every few days, so we decided to play it safe, and brought a 4L oil can with us, as well as some small spare parts (starter solenoid, sprocket nut and lockwasher). The SMT was brand new with only 9k on it, the main concern being that the 15k service should be done somewhere on the way for warranty purposes. For chain maintenance I carried a 1L bottle of 80w90 gear oil and a brush. We also had [a small toolkit](https://imgur.com/a/0psTdqg) with the basics required to work on the brakes, bodywork, get to the battery and fuses, and make emergency repairs (tape/tiewraps/wire). Both of us have worldwide roadside assistance, and since we weren't planning on straying too far from civilization we didn't carry camping or cooking gear, nor equipment to change tires. While on the road we would grease the chains and give the bikes a good lookover every few days at least.

***Navigation and lodging***

Both bikes have Garmin XTs mounted, and for each day we'd make a GPX in Kurviger and upload it to the navis. We had a general route in mind but the details were usually worked out over dinner the night before with some old-fashioned paper maps and some local information sprinkled in. Apart from the first and the last day we mostly avoided motorways, and on average did about 300km a day. We'd typically ride for 60 - 90 minutes each between breakfast, coffee, lunch, and afternoon drinks, and arrival so about 4 - 6 hours of riding each day. 

When it came to lodging we went with BnB's, apartments, and hotels found through the usual channels. I have done some light camping in the past but never on longer motorcycle trips and never with J., so if we ever wanted to, we'd have to do some practice runs first. We didn't have a strict budget per se, but tried to stay within about ‚Ç¨250 a day on average, including two tanks of fuel.

## **Leg 1: [Netherlands to Macedonia](https://imgur.com/a/EUMKvRV)**
***

* Day 1 and 2: Freiburg, Germany (700km)

We left around 11h00 for an _autobahn_ sit to Freiburg, arriving for dinner with friends of mine who live near the city. I know there's a lot to see in-between: the Ardennes, Luxemburg, the Black Forest, the Vosges.. but we've been to those places many, many times already and when you're on the way south it's preferable to take long strides sometimes. We suffered through heavy rainstorms near Frankfurt but by the time we pulled off the highway two hours later it was warm and dry. The next day we took a bit of a rest and explored the city together with my mates. Freiburg is a large university town with a young vibe and a lovely mix of provincial and cosmopolitan Germany. Worth a stop, if you're ever nearby. 

* Day 3: Lech, Austria (350km)

We took off through the southernmost part of the Black Forest to arrive on the shores of the Bodensee (Lac Konstanz) for a sun-drenched lunch. I'd plotted a route from Bregenz along the [200] and [198] in Tyrol cause I'd never been to that part of Austria yet, and it was pretty decent and a bit quiet. We got some light rain in the afternoon, but generally decent weather. Out hotel for the night was a very cheap but run down classic mountain lodge, with rooms that have been in dire need of an overhaul since about 1995. It seemed to me like the family who owned it was squeezing it for what it was worth without investing anything in the place. [Dinner](https://imgur.com/a/bHbaEXV) and breakfast were decent however, but the wifi and cell reception was nonexistent in the little valley.

* Day 4: Tolmezzo, Italy (350km)

We left in the morning fog towards Imst, a road with great views of the southern Alps across the valley, towards Italy. We took a short bit of highway to get past Innsbruck, then turned south and east to Zell am Ziller and the [Grossglockner](https://imgur.com/a/bVcSklw). I've mostly been to the Swiss and Italian side of the Alps so this famous road was on the to-do list still. We arrived on a weekday just after lunch which meant it was fairly quiet, but I can imagine it being busy and annoying on weekends. The road is great but the toll is outrageous: ‚Ç¨35 per bike. It's worth it, at least for once, because the views and landscape are absolutely stunning. The road was built as a tourist attraction starting in 1930 as it didn't exist as a historical pass or anything, hence the tolls. Once across the GG we went southeast to the beautiful little [Plockenpass into Italy](https://imgur.com/a/YeZ9eFv), and arrived at [our BnB near Tolmezzo](https://imgur.com/a/QdwomvD). From here on the weather was pretty much impeccable for the rest of our trip.

* Day 5: Obrov, Slovenia (350km)

We started with a quiet mountain outing in the morning, towards Paularo and then north over an eerily quiet and narrow road towards the (unpaved) Polentin pass. We didn't take it though, instead continuing east to Pontebba, and then up the Sella Nevea and Predil passes into Slovenia. We followed the [203] and [102] south along the river through countless villages with traffic cameras seemingly every 500 meters. The temperature also built steadily and in the afternoon we were buckling in the 35 degree heat. Took a break near the [Skjocjan Caves](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xMC2N6PriYnVSjrb7) where the Karst landscape has been worn out by rainfall and underground rivers into endless tunnels which at some point collapsed leaving a [giant crater](https://imgur.com/a/g29pmdj) in the landscape, a bizarre and gorgeous sight, but also quiet at this time of day and cool in the forest. We found a gorgeous BnB in the [hills east of Trieste](https://imgur.com/a/A7Dt59x) which included a lovely dinner with local wines, and breakfast.

* Day 6: Bihac, Bosnia and Herzegovina (400km)

This turned out to be one of the more interesting days, cause a lot happened in quick succession. We approached the Adriatic over some beautiful B roads to enjoy morning coffee at the [little boulevard in Bakar](https://imgur.com/a/Uu2Z16G), next to Rijeka. After this we followed the coast, zooming between campers and caravans, with gorgeous views of the sea and numerous islands to our right. At our lunch stop in Senj we were approached by a Dutch couple who just returned from a MotoGymKhana tournament in Zagreb so we spent some time talking bikes with them, and afterwards we went up into the hills towards Dabar and eventualle Zeljava. We saw several 'warning: mines' signs on the side of the road, and in one little village where we stopped for drinks we were greeted by the local car tuning club, bunch of guys with old Audi's and VW's, ogling J., who didn't feel quite at ease. I noticed that several of them had Ustase stickers on their cars (local version of the SS, basically), lovely bunch. Croatia apparently has a bit of a problem with far right extremists. We got the hell outta there as soon as our colas were through. This part of Croatia felt very remote and rough, and although there were plenty of signs advertising apartments and BnB's, there was hardly anyone on the road. Not long after this we arrived at [Zeljava air base](https://imgur.com/a/2USAZA0) which is fairly well known at this point and a nice opportunity for a cheesy picture. [The border with Bosnia](https://imgur.com/a/AdpKuV1) was only a few miles away and was very easy: no inspections, no questions, just a quick glance at our passports and that was it. Immediately afterwards the landscape changed, with occasional [mosques](https://imgur.com/a/QVjhrCU) and orthodox christian churches in the little villages next to the road, old tractors chugging along with carts full of produce, and children playing in the street. One of the staff of our motel in Bihac explained that it was peaceful now, Muslims, Christians, and everyone tolerating each other pretty much. We noticed how the mosque in town _did_ call for prayer like usual but in a rather quiet and short version unlike the minute-long yammering you get in the Middle East, and plenty of restaurants served alcohol. The crowd in the street also seemed varied, could've been anyplace Europe, basically. The town itself was situated along a shallow river with a fairground, restaurants, and bars and loads of people and kids around, it felt very organic and friendly. We had great burgers at a 'wine bar' which turned out to have exactly two kinds of wine, red and white.

* Day 7 and 8: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (300km)

Breakfast was intense: we got eggs, a bunch of baked or steamed vegetables, and no less than three different kinds of sausages as well as bacon and olives, and no coffee (which was off because [Bosnian coffee](https://imgur.com/a/wBJiDYF) in general is quite good). By god did I wish for an espresso and some croissants! We followed the main road along the river all day towards Sarajevo, and saw several more signs indicating mines as well as remnants from the war: numerous buildings, large and small, had bullet holes and even [grenade impacts](https://imgur.com/a/i4z3pxD), which had either been left in place or re-stucced in a different colour for emphasis. Gasoline was only about 1‚Ç¨ per liter which made for easy fueling, and all but the smallest places accepted card payments. We stopped for lunch in Jajce with its [gorgeous waterfalls](https://imgur.com/a/Jo0XbnO), situated among green rolling hills. The roads were generally good and traffic was light. It was quite hot in the afternoon so around Zenica we decided to take the highway for the last hour towards Sarajevo.

The next day we visited one of the [museums](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2JVpHjsi9jetyixZ7) about the siege which was.. a haunting experience. It's truly despicable how the international community sat by and watched while civilians were being starved and shot at daily for nearly four years. We walked around town a good bit and came across numerous monuments and memorials. In the afternoon we took the cable car up to Trebevic hill which gave a great [view of the city](https://imgur.com/a/QIIsjEn) and is the location of the [abandoned bobsled track](https://imgur.com/a/R9kgsk5) from the [1984 winter olympics](https://imgur.com/a/2xMBZj4). Like the rest of Bosnia, Sarajevo was in a reasonably good state and it felt clean, and modern. The old town is extremely touristy with all the garbage trinket shops, ice cream vendors, and tourist traps this brings, but at the same time it maintains a quaint and interesting atmosphere. 

* Day 9: Berane, Montenegro (300km)

About an hour east of Sarajevo we were taking a little roadside break, when suddenly a fluffy little shape walks across the road not 20ft away. I whisper to J. in my mic.. ""_there's a bear cub here, get back on the bike quick and quiet cause we need to go now_"". Really didn't feel like meeting his mom! The [R450] and [R467] feel quiet and remote, and run by some very pretty rocky canyons and little lakes. We crossed into Serbia later morning, just for a short stint cause the [182] goes nowhere except south into Montenegro. Both crossings were extremely quiet and easy without questions or hassle. The [P10] and [E65] south lead through some pretty landscapes, flowing green hills and mountains very much like the past few days, except it had been _desurfaced_ for a distance of nearly 20 miles in anticipation of major repairs/upgrades, so we spent almost an hour driving dead slow along rocky white gravel in a filthy dusty mist thrown up by the cars in front of us. My snot was like clay for hours after this and the bikes looked like they'd been through a [cement](https://imgur.com/a/RXnJg6r) [mixer](https://imgur.com/a/A0iF9OK).

* Day 10: Givgelija, Macedonia (400km)

Our hostel was situated on the ski slopes with a [magnificent breakfast view](https://imgur.com/a/w4JkU1U), after which we took the steep hairpins back down to the main road. We entered Kosovo half an hour later, the border crossing was busier than the others we'd had so far but not much of a hassle. We had to buy temporary insurance worth ‚Ç¨6 per bike since Kosovo is de facto independent from Serbia but not formally recognised by the European insurance companies yet. The [R106] down from the Montegrin mountains onto the Kosovo plain was spectacular with great tarmac, beautiful hairpins, and a sweet view. The central plain south of Pristina was extremely boring and busy and it was crazy hot as well, so we only dipped into the capital briefly for a glance at the Bill Clinton [statue](https://imgur.com/a/O4w0qTJ) (they're grateful to NATO in general and ol' Bill specifically for the 1999 intervention which eventually resulted in their independence) before heading south towards Macedonia. The combination of scorching heat and ferry ticket prices (to Crete) meant that we had to make a bit of speed these days. Highways aren't nearly always boring though, the [E75] southeast of Skopje weaves and bends through a beautiful rocky landscape with the occasional olive grove and winery. It was nice to be able to keep up the speed in the scorching heat. Our place for tonight was the quite luxurious but also very cheap Sky Hotel barely a mile north of the Greek border. We sat on the roof terrace in the still-heavy evening heat enjoying a beer and chatting with the waiter who spoke perfect English and recommended some local dishes to us. One of them seemed a bit like lasagna (oven dish with layers of vegetables, tomatoes, and cheese) however upon my comparison the guy was adamant that I was an idiot and that it was in fact not at all like lasagna.

* Day 11: Kalambaka, Greece (300km)

For most of our time in [Greece](https://imgur.com/a/0fJOzBl) the mid-day temperatures were around 35 degrees and we were stopping every 30-45mins for a drink, and if possible to dunk our buff and gloves in water somewhere which would make the next 30 mins on the bike bearable. This morning we followed the main road south to Thesaloniki and then Katerini, where we turned right into the hills, along the foot of [mount olympos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aGR3VAEcjhqrov846). The inner part of Greece isn't as touristy as the coast and some of the cities, so the roads were fairly quiet, first the [13] and then the [26] and [15] to Kalambaka and [the Meteora](https://imgur.com/a/nnliiNQ). We were absolutely soaking with sweat when we arrived, however the view is.. off this world. I can only imagine the reactions of the first stone-age Greeks as they ventured inland and came across [this landscape](https://imgur.com/a/aZXrn2k) which appears [straight out of a high fantasy series](https://imgur.com/a/hq1yRby). We took a long cold shower then went for a (slow!) walk [around the foot of these hills](https://imgur.com/a/OfmyFEX) (this is funny because I'm a biologist and the sign says MICROBIOLOGIKO) in the evening heat, we'd planned on going a longer circuit but the heat made it impossible. 

* Day 12: Piraeus (350km)

We left very early in the morning to try and beat the some of the worst heat, speeding along the [E65] towards Lamia along a valley which was [a good bit greener](https://imgur.com/a/rxcfHQr) than the rest of Greece, probably due to rain runoff from the surrounding mountains. Giant olive/orange/lime orchards were all over the place and the road was flanked by ancient rock quarries and a snaking railway that seemed rather newly built. Once up in the hills south of Lamia the temperature dropped somewhat and we got to take a number of [remote little roads](https://imgur.com/a/6sJlzDQ)(not pictured: 42 degrees celsius!) full of hairpins which ran straight through villages with very surprised looking old Greek men on the road side. We had a long [lunch and a swim in Antikyra](https://imgur.com/a/t4b6gv7), and around 15h00 we wetted our gear once again to brace against the stifling heat on the road to Athens. We had planned for a curvy coastal road but we were so tired and fed up with the heat that we decided to stick to the main roads and even took a bit of highway. Interesting to note is that the Greek toll system is very different from the French/Spanish/Italian ones, in the sense that you don't take a ticket and pay when you leave the road, but you just stop at a toll station every 10-20km on the road and pay directly for that distance. Oftentimes it was no more than 50 cents, occasionally 1 or 2 euro's. 

Athens and the surroundings suffer from a terrible case of urban heat syndrome and evening traffic made it all the worse, it was close to 40 degrees on the main road into Piraeus. We were splitting at a decent pace between the commuters but still local bikes and scooters zoomed around us every which way.

* Day 13 and 14: Matala (100km)

We boarded the ferry [Piraeus -> Heraklion](https://imgur.com/a/tZ4ERL7) around 08h30 with a large backpack full of groceries: water, bread, olives, snacks, some fruit, etc. The onboard offerings are usually overpriced medium quality so it's best to bring your own. We picked a nice spot in the shade on the rear deck and spent the day gazing our over the mediterranean, reading, or sipping coffee (the only thing worth buying from the bar, basically). At one point I though I saw some dolphins in the distance but was unable to verify :(

Crete is a little cooler than the mainland which felt like a welcome change, and the ride south across the island to [Matala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matala,_Crete) was uneventful. We found a nice little guest house with airconditioning and a good place to park, so all was well. We took a rest the next day, went [hiking](https://imgur.com/a/RlxikkH), swimming, enjoyed a long seaside lunch followed by a siesta, and sauntered along the little town which while rather touristy on the hand, was also small enough to maintain a distinct aura of local innocence on the other. There's a cute little harbour with a small beach and beautiful [rock formations](https://imgur.com/a/Dgdoc9p) right next to it, [hippie graffiti and art](https://img1.vakantio.de/uploads/f83fb11285e4535ba04c81438f9a2a7d_large.avif), as well as a lot of small bars and restaurants. Not a bad place for a break!

* Day 15 and 16: Rethymno (350km)

We rode along the rocky coastal road westwards towards Selia and Komitades, and then north and slightly easy back to Rethymno. The mountains sometimes seem to rise straight from the sea! We passed through [several](https://imgur.com/a/J2PUouS) [rocky gorges](https://imgur.com/a/3a9kxWQ) where all life had gone grey and yellow except right next to what used to be the stream. Even insects were few and far between since it hadn't rained in over a month with consistent 30-degree temperatures. The southern coast is rather quiet with only the occasional tour bus going to the gorges, on the other hand the northern coast is extremely touristy and rather bland. Endless hotels, resorts, restaurants and a huge traffic jam all the way in between. Rethymno itself has a decent boulevard and harbour but the town itself is inundated with tourists and it's difficult to find affordable and authentic places to eat and shop. It's basically the same souvenir store with fridge magnets, coffee cups, and dresses copy-pasted a few hundred times. 

We took a bit of a rest day after this, J. was a bit tired so she hopped on the back of the SMT and we drove a bit west to see the [ruins of Aptera](https://imgur.com/a/BtdR5As) and then went for lunch + a swim in the town of Stavros just north of Chania. Turned out to have been the exact beach location used in the movie [Zorba the Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorba_the_Greek_\(film\)). 

* Day 17: Heraklion (100km)

We left early in the morning because I had an appointment with the KTM garage in Heraklion - it was sitting at nearly 14.000km and the 15k service was near. Napels might also have been an option but that might have been stretching it. Any way we arrived at the shop around 10h00 to find all the lifts occupied and nobody in a rush to help despite the appointment. We had to wait a good half hour before the lead mechanic was finished and told us it'd take at least two hours for the oil change and minor checks, so we spent the rest of the morning and lunch at a nearby caf√© under the blissful air conditiong. We had planned to go for a longer ride in the afternoon towards Arkalohchori but the long wait and the stifling heat killed the mood, so we went for an early check in at our hotel, spending the rest of the afternoon and evening strolling around town, visiting museums and writing postcards. The [Heraklion Archaological Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ficYA6SQZFYV2udB8) was sweet, they had [so much stuff](https://imgur.com/a/3fwLREq) that they could easily split into five different museums each with a proper collection!

* Day 18: Nafplion (200km)

The return [ferry to Piraeus](https://imgur.com/a/BQbSMtZ) left at 09h00 and we were well-prepared again with our bag of groceries. In retrospect it would've been preferable to stay a few more days on Crete considering the costs of the ferry (‚Ç¨120 for a one-way for two pax and two bikes), and I wouldn't have minded spending another day or two in Matala and having another day for a bike trip either to the eastern or western point of the island. But we had a wee bit of a schedule to keep and were also dependent on the Igoumenitsa - Brindisi ferry which was far more expensive and this required careful planning.

It was hot again in Piraeus late afternoon, so we quickly jumped on the bikes and made our way across the Isthmus of Corinth towards Nafplion in the peloponnese. A gorgeous old town with a touristy aftertaste, Nafplion has been an important harbour since Roman times, with several large fortresses either [in the harbour](https://imgur.com/a/tqqWHGm) or [on the hills](https://imgur.com/a/aQFQjTF) right behind it.

* Day 19: Vonitsa (350km)

From Nafplion we drove around the bay to Lerna and then west into the hills of the Arcadia, already famous in ancient times for its 'untouched' landscape. We followed the [7], [111] and the [33] west, then turned north near Agria Triade, towards Patras. It was at this point that the rear hugger of the Tiger broke and started rattling like crazy. We got lucky at one of the gas stations when the clerk had [a drill I could borrow](https://imgur.com/a/rbKit10), and I fixed it with a nice [tiewrap stitch](https://imgur.com/a/DUOX0wB). It was also during this day that J. cried out in pain at some point, when a hornet the size of a fist took a bite out of her leg, right through her mesh suit. Even three weeks later the damn wound hasn't healed completely. It doesn't sound like much but this was one of my favorite days in Greece since it was quiet, green, not _too_ hot in the mountains, and just hours and hours of endless curves and pretty landscapes. From Patras we went north to the little peninsula of Aitoliko which is an extremely run-down town which to be honest should have been a tourist hotspot, considering the location on the coast, and the views.

## **Leg 3: [Italy and back home](https://imgur.com/a/4IfzBCs)**
***

* Day 20: Brindisi, Italy (150km)

Our [ferry to Italy](https://imgur.com/a/SAti71g) left at 14h00 only, so we took a slow morning with breakfast along the shores of the Ambracian gulf, near the location where in 31 BCE Octavian (the later emperor Caesar Augustus) with a little help from Marcus Agrippa [defeated the forces of Marc Antony and Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium), effectively becoming sole ruler of the mediterranean and shaping Europe for the ages. From there we took the sweet coastal road past Lichnos and Sivota and arrived in Igoumenitsa in time for some lunch and grocery shopping. The ferry itself was uneventful and our hostel for the night was a rundown place so I won't waste time on that.

* Day 21 and 22: Sorrento (450km)

We left at 07h00 and made our way along the [E90] to Taranto for breakfast. This part of Apulia is flat with mainly agriculture and a lot of abandoned and ruined farmhouses and industry. Even the roadside is filthy with trash dumped everywhere. After a sweet Italian breakfast and some cappuchinos with a view of the Taranto harbour, we continued north-west into the hills along the [E847], [SP103] and [SS92], coming by some some pretty historical villages (and ruins) such as Pisticci, [Craco](https://imgur.com/a/nIPOew8), and Stigliano. Once near Potenza it was getting awfully hot again so from here on we stuck to the main roads before arriving at the stunning [Amalfi coast](https://imgur.com/a/ciBQWU6) near Salerno. If you're ever in the neighbourhood, go here, rent a bike, and drive the [SS163] here!

The next day we drove down to the Sorrento harbour in [the local biker outfit](https://imgur.com/a/czTDXNu), and took the ferry into Napoli harbour and played tourist for a bit, before taking the train back in the evening. We had real nice BnB on a hill near Vico Equense which offered [sweet views of Napoli bay and the Visuvius](https://imgur.com/a/pzEu5FT)!

* Day 23: Cassino (300km)

We followed the coast towards Pompeii then took a number of quiet mountain roads (which I can't find on the map for the life of me) towards Avellino and Benevento. From there we stuck to the hills all the way towards Piedimonte, Pietrovairano with it's beautiful (and only very recently discovered) [Roman theatre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/imfMfi2Rqo1PftUc8), and eventually Cassino where drove up all the way to [the abbey](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zNfdCF5skY5B63dh6) for a stroll. The abbey was completely destroyed by the USAF in 1944 (along with several hundred refugees sheltering) because intel indicated that the Germans were using it as an observation post (which was false). Look up [the battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino) if you're even remotely interested in history!

* Day 24: Trasimene (350km)

From Cassino we headed to the coast near Latina to circumvent Rome as much as possible (already been there - not keen on traffic!) and had coffee on the beach near the Fiumichino airport. From there we followed the coast all the way to Tarquinia where we turned right towards Viterbo, the ancient [Papal residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Popes_in_Viterbo), then continued inland along the highway towards lake Trasimene, the location of [the second of Hannibals' stunning victories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Trasimene) against the Romans during the second Punic war. The landscape in this part of Italy is green rolling hills, much unlike the dry near-desert of the south. We found an [old-fashioned but affordable](https://imgur.com/a/BtChvyA) and friendly hotel a little ways away from the lake shore.

* Day 25 and 26: Cinque Terre (350km)

From Trasimene we crossed Tuscany towards Siena en Pontedera, a hypertouristic region but also well deserved. The landscape is a characteristic greenish/brown dotted with cypress-lined country lanes, orchards and vineyards, and the architecture is [extremely picturesque](https://iconiclife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tuscany-Italy-countryside.jpg). We went by the iconic [Gladiator filming location](https://imgur.com/a/BEfa0u6) and definitely weren't the only one in line. Foreign license plates are everywhere and traffic in the bigger towns is super busy. There's also wine-tastings advertised every couple miles at least so being on the road here in the late afternoon carries a bit of risk no doubt. Lastly we took a wee bit of highway to La Spezia since it was, again, stupid hot, and once there turned onto the hills just behind Cinque Terre to reach Manarola, our stay for tonight. CT is one of the most touristic places in Italy ([and well-deserved tbh](https://imgur.com/a/CJP7UUv)), and the most iconic five towns are difficult to reach by vehicle, we had to [park nearly a mile outside the little town along the road](https://imgur.com/a/fuLzsrl) and carry our luggage all the way. We managed to find an affordable BnB with a _great_ breakfast for just over ‚Ç¨100 a night; most other places were more than twice as expensive.

The day after we took a nice lazy rest, went swimming in the [little rocky harbour](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bbcf00a9b8fe874ed2f03d0/75b3da41-f663-4d86-9225-4c1bba64f00e/cinque-terre-manarola.jpg?format=2500w), took the train to nearby [Vernazza](https://imgur.com/a/x51YTg6) (absolute _packed_ with tourists: American, Chinese, German mostly it seemed), had an expensive but lovely lunch, and then boated back to Manarola. CT is expensive in the main season but [the coast is stunning](https://imgur.com/a/BwzCJ7X) so if you're ever around and can find a decently-priced place to stay (or simply visit slightly in the off-season..).

* Day 27: Milan (250km)

From Cinque Terre we followed the coast north-west and then slightly inland to Rivarola, from which we took the [SS586], [SP586R] and the [SS45] north-east to Piacenza. The whole region consists of low, [forested mountains](https://imgur.com/a/ly15ci7) and in-between the villages it feels eerily quiet. We met a handful of Italian biker groups and near Marsaglia came across an accident site where a Street Fighter V4 had struck the front end of an oncoming car. The bike was wrecked and the rider was in obvious distress on the road side, his mates however appeared to have things under control and when we continued along we met the ambulance racing to the scene, coming the other way. When we descended towards the Po valley in the early afternoon the temperature shot up to the high thirties, and the Trebbia river which the road followed roughly north was dotted with parasols and playing children. Just south of Piacenza we visited the [battle memorial](https://imgur.com/a/8wPGRXq) near the location where Hannibal inflicted [the first of his three defeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trebia) against the Romans in 218 BCE. Although clearly marked on the map, the memorial doesn't have a dedicated place to park nor even a plaque or sign explaining what it is. From Piacenza we took the highway to Milan - J. was tired after all the mountain roads and by the extreme heat we faced in the afternoon. Milan was a bit of a surprise in mid-August, we found the city more or less abandoned with barely any traffic in the streets and much of the shops and restaurants closed. We spent the evening with friends, wandering around the 'new' part of town ([Piazza Gau Alente](https://imgur.com/a/pDIf9OC) and surroundings) and the ['tree library'](https://imgur.com/a/asCFhiO) next to it (which is really well done), after which we had an elaborate yet bargain dinner in [a tiny Chinese restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zFT87vWYaqZYtfNN7).

* Day 28,29,30: Davos, Switzerland (800km)

From Milan we rode north to Como, then followed the Swiss [2] and [13] along the valley to Bellinzona and eventually [San Bernardino](https://imgur.com/a/FkSe3sV). It's one of my favorite passes, too narrow for trucks and with a [gorgeous lake](https://imgur.com/a/mMCfKbm) at the top, and even the last stretch of the highway towards it has [bloody hairpins](https://imgur.com/a/POJxDWx)! From here we went along the beautiful Graub√ºndner valleys towards Thusis and eventually Davos. I've been coming to Davos regularly for more than a decade and the high season (winter) prices are legendary, however in late summer everything is decidedly more affordable; we managed to snatch a room in a fancy, old fashioned three-star hotel for just 400 francs for three nights. We had a [gorgeous mountain view](https://imgur.com/a/5aRFAn0) [from our balcony](https://imgur.com/a/Y30ghVG) and breakfast was everything you'd expect from a fancy place! 

The next morning we took off early towards the Fluela, Ofen, Fuorn, [Stelvio](https://imgur.com/a/7F82fiR), [Bernina](https://imgur.com/a/Y51T6Dd), and Albula passes respectively ([clockwise from the top](https://imgur.com/a/HcVHAZs)). A long day of [well-trodden mountain territory for both of us](https://imgur.com/a/JjXiquq), but goddamn if [this](https://imgur.com/a/81VqzaX) isn't what riding is about, I don't know what is. Weather was perfect and J. did extremely well even on the heavy tiger. We even got to a cute [couple picture](https://imgur.com/a/Pjbu5oo) taken! ü•∞

On the second rest day we took it real easy with only a short tour of the [Julier](https://imgur.com/a/QuStcLn) and Fluela passes in the morning, and a short hike and a relaxing swim in the afternoon. It was 28 degrees in Davos which is considered somewhat of a heat wave aroun there.

* Day 31: Freiburg, Germany (300km)

From Davos we took a number of minor (and not always very interesting) roads northeast through Switzerland and the Black Forest past Liechtenstein, St. Gallen, and Waldshut, while stopping in Winterthur for lunch with friends. It was extremely hot once more, and the holiday traffic in the Black Forest was exhausting, bloody campervans everywhere. We were happy to crash with friends after a cold shower, and with a cold beer!

* Day 32: Home (700km)

Straight shot north-west on the Autobahn. No irregularities ;)

## **Epilogue**
***

We got home mid-August filthy and tired after [8300km](https://imgur.com/a/ON68EP3). We spent two days washing, cleaning, and sorting through everything, and on the third day we took the bikes to the [car wash](https://imgur.com/a/fxblwlW) for a good scrub. After that, it was time to return to normal life more or less.

The bikes held up fine, only issues were the sometimes nonfunctional cruise control on the SMT, and the broken rear hugger of the Tiger. The latter drank nearly 4.5L of oil, which is a bit frustrating but unsurprising considering its age. I'm curious to see whether it'll hold up another ~60k til 300 without a major breakdown. I'm also very impressed with the SMT. It's comfortable on longer distances, easy to pack with luggage, but at the same time also light and nimble, and an absolute riot in the mountains.

***Favorite roads:*** (in no particular order)

* [Unnamed road between Paularo and Pontebba in north-eastern Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/24768qrnwdibcr1M8). Narrow and curvy, the tarmac was nonexistent at times but the sweet and quiet alpine landscape and the looming peaks were stunning. Navigation will claim that the road is closed due to a landslide but this has been fixed recently. There's a lovely _[agroturismo](https://imgur.com/a/TWcwzEI)_ halfway for coffee and snacks, be sure to bring cash. You can also cross the unpaved Polentin pass into Austria from there.

* [The R467 in Bosnia between Pijesak and the Serbian border](https://maps.app.goo.gl/joRnQFxbVpc6vhwJ8). Gorgeous green hills interspersed with little lakes and rivers. Extremely quiet, and uhh, there's bears. The whole route felt dreamy.

* [The 111 in the Arcadia, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xhAtjT5vMdVMDfzK6). Endlessly long, very quiet, a mix of green and rocky, and decently surfaced with endless curves and spectacular views. Part of it feel like the Alps almost, with ski resorts and wooden lodges.

* [Unnamed coastal road south of Igoumenitsa, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BXybD55hn3GT9Pot9). Stunning views of the rocky coastline with small forested islands dotted about and Corfu looming in the distance. The hulking ferries chugging along on the horizon really put things into perspective.

* [The SS163 on the Amalfi coast, Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2RU3wuSnz8RKBnvg8). This road is a testament to man's arrogance. Endless tunnels, bridges, and little villages with not a level square meter of soil in sight. Do not attempt with a car.


***Personal notes***

Traveling like this with your partner certainly makes things more interesting, it's far more intense than just living together, because there's never a quiet moment: you're always on the road together, resting, eating, sleeping together. You can't bugger off to spend the evening with friends, you can't isolate yourself with games, a book, or garden work. In that sense it's a great relationship test, and the important part is to communicate about the frustrations that arise, because you'll both be going through them. We did fine overall, but there were certainly difficult days and occasions when I really just wanted to have some time to myself. At the same time you do get to know each other better through such circumstances, and I wouldn't trade that for the world.

If you're ever wondering if motorcycle touring is for you - let this tale be of inspiration? Start small, just a few days here and there, then work your way up. Onroad, offroad, camping, hotels, you can do it in whatever way works for you. Collect maps, bags, accessories, tools, and chase that horizon! It's an intense way to travel, but also one of the best to actually _see_ the places you're going through.

1nf9wb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nf9wb4/the_graveyard_shift/,The Graveyard Shift,"

The thing about the overnight shift is the silence. Between midnight and four, the convenience store might as well be floating in space, the hum of the refrigerators the only sound. Marissa had worked the graveyard for just over a month, long enough to memorize the cadence of her regulars: the truckers grabbing black coffee, the drunk college kids hunting for chips, the insomniacs who stared too long at the freezer doors before settling for ice cream.

She didn‚Äôt mind it. The quiet gave her time to think, and the fluorescent lights made it feel like the world outside wasn‚Äôt real.

The first night he came in, she almost didn‚Äôt notice him. Just another customer: mid-thirties maybe, tall but a little slouched, hair pressed flat like he hadn‚Äôt washed it in a few days. He bought a soda and some jerky, smiled when she asked how his night was going.

‚ÄúBetter now,‚Äù he said, soft enough she had to lean in to hear it.

She laughed politely, because that‚Äôs what you do when you‚Äôre a woman behind a counter at two a.m. and a man looks at you like that.

The second night, he came in again. Same time. Same smile. This time, he stayed longer, lingering by the coffee machine, staring at the racks of gum like he was memorizing them. When she rang him up, he asked, ‚ÄúYou always here this late?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGraveyard shift.‚Äù

He nodded like she‚Äôd just told him a secret.

By the end of the week, he was coming in every night. Always around 2:30. Always with the same soda, sometimes chips, sometimes not. He asked her name. She told him because it seemed harmless. ‚ÄúMarissa,‚Äù he repeated, like he was practicing it.

The first time it felt wrong was when she stepped outside to smoke behind the store. The alley was empty, trash cans lined up like shadows, the hum of the streetlamp buzzing overhead. She lit up, inhaled, and then noticed it: a silhouette at the far end of the lot.

Tall. Still. Watching.

She flicked the cigarette, went back inside, locked the back door.

The next night, he came in at 2:30 like clockwork. Same soda, same smile. ‚ÄúYou smoke menthols, right?‚Äù he asked casually.

Her stomach dropped.

‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù she asked, forcing a laugh.

He grinned wider. ‚ÄúJust a guess.‚Äù

After that, she started noticing things. The way he‚Äôd glance at the clock before coming up to the register, always timing it so they‚Äôd be alone in the store. The way his eyes lingered too long on her hands as she counted change. The way he never bought much, like the purchase was just an excuse to be near her.

By the third week, he was waiting outside when she closed up. Standing across the street, hands in his pockets, not moving. Just staring.

She reported it to her manager. He shrugged. ‚ÄúIf he hasn‚Äôt done anything, there‚Äôs nothing we can do. Call the cops if he gets weird.‚Äù

But weird had already started.

One morning, after her shift, she walked up the stairs to her apartment and found something wedged into her doorframe. A single soda can. The same brand he always bought. Her name written across it in Sharpie.

She dropped it, ran inside, and shoved the deadbolt closed.

The next week was worse. She‚Äôd see him in the reflection of the glass doors, not even pretending to shop anymore, just standing at the end of an aisle, watching her. She started keeping a box cutter in her pocket. Her hands shook when she held it.

Then came the night of the storm. Rain hammered the windows, thunder rolled low across the sky. The store was empty for hours, just her and the hum of the freezers. She thought maybe he wouldn‚Äôt show.

At 2:30, the bell above the door jingled.

He was soaked through, hair plastered to his head, but he was smiling wider than ever. In his hands, he held nothing. No soda. No chips. Just his empty, dripping hands.

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt outside for your smoke tonight,‚Äù he said.

Her throat closed.

‚ÄúI waited,‚Äù he went on, stepping closer to the counter. ‚ÄúI waited a long time.‚Äù

Marissa reached into her pocket for the box cutter, clicked the blade out, held it low where he couldn‚Äôt see. Her heart thudded so hard she thought he could hear it.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should come here anymore,‚Äù she managed, voice tight.

He tilted his head. ‚ÄúBut this is our time.‚Äù

Lightning flashed outside, a white flicker that caught his eyes‚Äîhungry, unblinking.

She pressed the blade against her thigh, grounding herself. ‚ÄúLeave,‚Äù she said.

For a moment, he just stared. Then he smiled wider, too wide, like his face would split. He leaned close enough she could smell the rain on his clothes and the sour on his breath.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see me again,‚Äù he whispered.

And then he was gone, walking out into the storm.

Marissa locked the doors, called her manager, then the police. But when they searched, he was nowhere. No tracks in the mud. No trace he‚Äôd been there at all.

She quit the job two days later. But even now, months on, every night at 2:30, she wakes with the feeling of eyes on her, and the faintest sound of the bell above the store door ringing.

1nf9vga,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nf9vga/the_patient_seat/,The Patient Seat,"

Chapter One ‚Äî The New Patient

At eight fifty-eight, the elevator deposited a man into the foyer with the clean, hollow sound of unvarnished shoes. He stood there a beat too long‚Äîlong enough to read every framed certificate on the wall and to glance down the hallway at the red EXIT sign as if clocking it for later. When he finally moved, it was with an economical, almost rehearsed stride.

‚ÄúMr. Vale?‚Äù I asked, stepping out from my office. ‚ÄúAdrian?‚Äù

He smiled a fraction too quickly. ‚ÄúDoctor Rhodes.‚Äù

I shook his hand. His palm was dry, cool. No anxious clamminess. A firm grip, exactly two pumps, then release. Most people either cling or pull away; he did neither.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù I said.

He took the seat opposite mine on the far side of the coffee table. Everyone sank a little into that chair; it was part of why I chose it‚Äîsomething about the upholstery encouraged honesty. Adrian didn‚Äôt sink. He sat upright, ankles crossed, hands laid neatly on each thigh like a man about to be photographed.

The office smelled faintly of orange oil and old books. The blinds were half-closed against the late-summer glare, turning the room into bands of warm gold and shade. The metronome on my desk ticked quietly‚Äînot because I use it, but because some patients like sound.

‚ÄúWould you like water?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo, thank you.‚Äù His eyes moved. Not fidgety; cataloging. The metronome, the diplomas, the shelf of toys for the occasional child intake I took on as a favor to a colleague. He took it all in and brought his focus back to me with deliberate care.

I clicked my pen and glanced at the intake form he‚Äôd filled out in the waiting room. Name, age thirty-four. Employment: consultant. Vague. Past therapy: none. Medication: none. Emergency contact: a line through the box.

‚ÄúWhat brings you in, Adrian?‚Äù I asked.

He tilted his head like he was weighing whether to tell the truth or the thing that passes for truth in the first ten minutes. ‚ÄúInsomnia,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been sleeping.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù

‚ÄúA while.‚Äù Another precise smile. ‚ÄúThe summer.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny particular event that precipitated it?‚Äù

‚ÄúPrecipitated.‚Äù He tasted the word, then nodded. ‚ÄúWork got‚Ä¶ busy.‚Äù

‚ÄúBusy how?‚Äù

‚ÄúTravel,‚Äù he said, and when that didn‚Äôt land as a complete answer, he added, ‚ÄúProjects overlapping. New clients. The usual disease of ambition.‚Äù

He had a voice people listened to in meetings. Not deep, exactly‚Äîcontrolled. He didn‚Äôt add filler to buy time. He let silence sit between sentences like a third person at the table.

‚ÄúTell me about the insomnia,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúFalling asleep, staying asleep, early waking?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll three in rotation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI fall asleep readily. I wake at two, three. Sometimes there‚Äôs a‚Ä¶ pressure. Like the air is heavier than it should be.‚Äù

‚ÄúPanic?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He considered. ‚ÄúNot panic. Awareness.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf what?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf being awake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOf being a person inside a body.‚Äù

The pen moved in my hand out of habit. Somatic awareness in the night. Possible depersonalization? It had the ring of someone reading the right page of a book and choosing not to turn it.

‚ÄúDo you dream?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to?‚Äù I asked.

He smiled for real then. It changed his face in a small, unsettling way. ‚ÄúIs that important?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt can be.‚Äù

He glanced at the blinds again, the slashes of light. ‚ÄúThen yes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to remember.‚Äù

‚∏ª

I‚Äôm not fond of reading trauma into every polished sentence. People arrive here mid-story, and it is tempting‚Äîdangerous‚Äîto decide who they are before they decide to tell you. So I asked about the simple things. Diet. Caffeine. Exercise. He ate well, or said he did. Coffee in the morning, never after noon. Ran three miles, four times a week. He didn‚Äôt drink, except to be social, which felt like something he‚Äôd learned to say rather than something he did.

‚ÄúFriends?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúA few.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt elaborate.

‚ÄúFamily?‚Äù

He considered that like a trick. ‚ÄúComplicated,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúComplicated good or complicated bad?‚Äù

He laughed softly. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

When he looked at me, he met my eyes fully. People who lie often look away. People who posture often hold eye contact too long. He did neither‚Äîhe met and released like someone who‚Äôd been taught the exact right ratio.

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù I asked after a time. ‚ÄúThere are a dozen therapists within five blocks.‚Äù

He lifted a shoulder. ‚ÄúYou write about restraint.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúYou read my book.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe one about grief as a long hallway. And the paper about‚Ä¶ what was it? Ethical containment? The idea that a therapist‚Äôs job is to hold‚Äînot to fix.‚Äù

He was right. I had written that. It had been quoted back to me at a conference, stripped of context and turned into a cudgel. Men like to hear that they can hold something without being changed by it.

‚ÄúWhat about that appealed to you?‚Äù I asked.

He looked amused. ‚ÄúWhy does it appeal to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs true,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBecause therapy isn‚Äôt surgery. The patient isn‚Äôt asleep while you remove something. They‚Äôre awake. They‚Äôre carrying the weight with you. If you try to fix, you often break.‚Äù

He nodded, satisfied. ‚ÄúI want that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe holding, not the fixing.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom what?‚Äù I asked.

He waited, and the metronome ticked. ‚ÄúIntrusive thoughts,‚Äù he said at last.

‚ÄúViolent?‚Äù

The smile appeared and vanished. ‚ÄúYou leapt there quickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a common category,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù he agreed. He tapped his thumb twice against his thigh and stopped, as if he‚Äôd set a limit for himself and had reached it. ‚ÄúI think about what people are for.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople as in‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúPersons,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIndividual bodies. Roles. Uses.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean utility.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the blunt term, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúIncluding yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúEspecially,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm useful at a certain temperature. Below that, indifferent. Above that, I burn.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you hurt yourself when you burn?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you hurt others?‚Äù

He smiled without showing teeth. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a legal question.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a human one.‚Äù

He looked at me for a long time. I let him. The metronome ticked; someone down the hall closed a door; the world outside drew a sunny breath.

‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn thought.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny desire to act on those thoughts?‚Äù

‚ÄúDesire,‚Äù he repeated. ‚ÄúAnother blunt term.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat would your term be?‚Äù

‚ÄúCuriosity,‚Äù he said.

I wrote it down, not for the chart, but so I‚Äôd see it in my handwriting later. The word bent differently on paper. Curiosity can justify a great deal when it‚Äôs allowed to.

‚ÄúCuriosity how?‚Äù I asked.

About the human body? I did not say. The question hung between us with all its implications anyway.

‚ÄúAbout the arrangement of things,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe hidden hinges. The places where pressure changes the outcome.‚Äù

‚ÄúSystems,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúSystems,‚Äù he agreed. ‚ÄúThey interest me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat systems are we talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúFamily. Work,‚Äù he said, and then tipped his head at me, a small bow. ‚ÄúTherapy.‚Äù

‚ÄúTherapy as a system.‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúA room. Rules. Ritual objects.‚Äù He pointed at the metronome without touching it. ‚ÄúA man asks questions. Another man answers.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one version,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the other?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes the man in the chair asks better questions than the one holding the pen,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSometimes the rules are the trap.‚Äù

His gaze warmed a little. Not friendliness‚Äîappreciation. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúI thought you might be interesting.‚Äù

‚∏ª

I‚Äôve had first sessions where everything is obvious and unremarkable. I‚Äôve had first sessions where people wept for forty minutes, exhausted by the work of arriving. This was neither. This was a dinner party with a stranger you immediately know could become a friend, or a mistake.

‚ÄúTell me about a typical day,‚Äù I said, a safe pivot. Ground the work in the ordinary. His eyes moved once toward the corner where the camera would be if I recorded sessions, which I don‚Äôt. He wanted to know who else would see him.

‚ÄúI wake at five,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRun. Shower. Coffee. I check my messages. I work until noon, eat something with protein, meet with clients. I try not to use screens after eight.‚Äù

‚ÄúSmart,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt help,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe insomnia?‚Äù

He nodded.

‚ÄúDo you try any practices? Breathwork, body scans, progressive relaxation‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI know the techniques,‚Äù he said, not unkindly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read the books. I can lower my heart rate and move heat through my limbs and count backwards by threes. I can do all the tricks. They work on the part of me that is a body. They don‚Äôt work on the part of me that is awake.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat wakes you?‚Äù

He breathed through his nose, long and slow, a runner‚Äôs breath. ‚ÄúNoise.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom where?‚Äù

‚ÄúUnder the floorboards,‚Äù he said, and then laughed at my face. ‚ÄúA joke, Doctor. I‚Äôm not haunted.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of noise?‚Äù

‚ÄúPattern,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA rhythm I didn‚Äôt choose.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre describing anxiety,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm describing awareness,‚Äù he corrected gently. ‚ÄúBut if anxiety makes you more comfortable, we can call it that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt care for diagnoses,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care for cages,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNames that give people permission to stop looking.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat would you like me to do with that?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHold it,‚Äù he said, and I felt my own words turn back on me. ‚ÄúBe a room I can enter where the hinges are known.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe can do that.‚Äù

He nodded, and I watched the minute relaxation in his shoulders‚Äîthe small mammal satisfaction of having mapped a new space.

‚ÄúHas anyone ever told you that you ask questions like you‚Äôre laying tripwires?‚Äù I asked, half to lighten the air.

‚ÄúOften,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUsually by people who enjoy being tripped.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI enjoy seeing where they fall.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt smile. He didn‚Äôt either. Something like honesty passed between us‚Äîmeaner than rapport, truer than banter.

‚∏ª

He noticed the scar on my left thumb. Most people do. He was polite enough not to ask. He noticed, too, the small, half-wilted fern by the window and the cup I use as a watering can. He didn‚Äôt look at the portrait of my wife on the bookshelf‚Äîour compromise that the photo can face me, not the room‚Äîuntil the very end. Even then, it was a brush of attention, not a stare.

‚ÄúAnything else you want me to know?‚Äù I asked when the hour edged toward full.

‚ÄúI like rules,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou said you don‚Äôt like cages.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like rules I choose,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTell me yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo violence in the room,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNo threats. No weapons. No secrets that involve ongoing harm you intend to commit.‚Äù

He cocked his head. ‚ÄúAnd if I intend to do harm?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe talk about it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe name it. We decide whether this room is the place to hold it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if it isn‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôd have to act,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEthically. Legally.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

He smiled. ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

The metronome ticked. The light shifted. I felt the peculiar calm that comes when the train of a session reaches the station on time without anyone putting a hand on the emergency brake.

‚ÄúSame time next week?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, already on his feet. He moved like a man who never tangled himself with furniture. ‚ÄúThank you, Doctor.‚Äù

He extended his hand again. I do not always shake at the end, but it seemed important to return the opening ritual. His grip was the same. Exact. Unthreatening. Unapologetic.

He reached the door and paused. ‚ÄúMay I ask you a question?‚Äù he said without turning.

‚ÄúYou may.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you keep the metronome on if you don‚Äôt use it?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople like sound,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt gives shape to silence.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr it pierces it,‚Äù he said, and then was gone down the hall, a clean silhouette dividing the afternoon.

PROGRESS NOTE: RHODES, SIMON, M.D. ‚Äî SESSION 1, PATIENT: VALE, ADRIAN (34)

Presenting complaint: Insomnia (onset early summer), nocturnal ‚Äúawareness,‚Äù intrusive thoughts categorized by patient as ‚Äúcuriosity.‚Äù

Observations: Highly controlled affect. Organized speech. Elevated observational acuity. Eye contact appropriate but deliberate. Motor calm. No psychomotor agitation. No thought disorder evident. Humor calibrated to test boundaries. Reads clinician‚Äôs published work; selected treatment based on theoretical alignment (‚Äúethical containment‚Äù). Avoidant of fixed diagnostic language; resists pathologizing but endorses behavioral routines consistent with anxiety and possible OCPD traits. States no current substance misuse. Family ‚Äúcomplicated.‚Äù No emergency contact provided.

Risk: Denies self-harm. Evasive when asked about harm to others: reframed as ‚Äúlegal vs. human‚Äù question; later: ‚Äúsometimes, in thought.‚Äù Does not endorse intent. No concrete plan disclosed. Protective factors unclear. Rapport adequate. Insight high (possibly performative).

Impression (tentative): Insomnia secondary to cognitive hyperarousal. Possible obsessive/compulsive personality features. Narcissistic traits? Antisocial traits? Too early to determine. Sophisticated defensive structure; uses language to depower clinician‚Äôs frame and test for control. Potential for manipulation present.

Plan: Weekly sessions (Tuesdays, 9 a.m.). Sleep hygiene interventions offered; patient states familiarity and partial nonresponse. Recommend beginning with containment and alliance-building; explore intrusive content in structured manner with explicit safety agreements. Request emergency contact at next visit. Maintain clear boundaries.

Note to self: Check missing persons bulletin from the last eight weeks; review patient language for overlap (‚Äúprojects,‚Äù ‚Äúarrangement,‚Äù ‚Äúhidden hinges‚Äù). Do not overpathologize the clean. Watch the hands.

‚∏ª

I have a small ritual after difficult first sessions. I open the window, even in summer, to let the air switch out. I turn the metronome off. I wait for my pulse to step down from alert to normal. I did all of that now and then sat, eyes half-closed, listening to the building‚Äôs sounds reassert themselves‚Äîthe elevator‚Äôs distant liver-spotted chime, Mrs. Ullman‚Äôs laugh spilling out around the corner, the click of my own tongue against the back of my teeth as I think.

On the table between the chairs, the intake form waited, the emergency contact box still a clean dark line.

I picked up my phone and thumbed open the local news. It‚Äôs a bad habit, one I‚Äôve indulged more since my book came out and strangers started turning their grief into puzzles for me to solve. My thumb hovered and then‚Äîagainst my better judgment‚ÄîI typed missing into the search bar and hit return.

Headlines unfurled: a woman who didn‚Äôt make it home from a late shift, a jogger whose route went cold two blocks from the river, a college sophomore whose friends assumed she‚Äôd gone to her boyfriend‚Äôs until she didn‚Äôt answer at three a.m. I skimmed, letting the details slide over the surface. It‚Äôs a bad habit, I tell myself again. It makes you see patterns in wood grain.

‚ÄúPeople like sound,‚Äù Adrian had said. ‚ÄúIt gives shape to silence.‚Äù

The metronome was quiet now, and the silence did not need shaping. It had shape enough. There are rooms you build to hold other people‚Äôs storms, and there are rooms you build that become storms of their own.

Next Tuesday at nine, he would come back. He would sit and fold his hands and look at the things in the room that were meant to be looked at and the things that weren‚Äôt. He would ask better questions. He would test the hinges.

I slid the intake form into the folder, wrote EMERGENCY CONTACT on a yellow Post-it and stuck it to the inside cover. I washed my hands‚Äîwarm water, unscented soap, the careful ritual I don‚Äôt do for germs but for the motion itself‚Äîand dried them on the thin office towel. When I turned, the window breathed an inch wider and the summer city came softly in: siren far off, gull cry sharp, an engine idling on the street like a thought that wouldn‚Äôt quite leave.

I switched the metronome back on, just to feel the room tick.

Two, three, four.

The silence pressed close again, like the air had grown just heavier than before, and I told myself it was the weather. I told myself it was nothing. I told myself I was a room.

I did not say out loud that every room has a door, and every door has a lock, and locks exist because someone, somewhere, likes to learn where pressure changes the outcome.

Chapter Two ‚Äî Patterns in the Dark

The second session began the same as the first: Adrian entered at precisely 8:59, not a second earlier or later. He sat in the same chair, in the same posture, and folded his hands the same way.

If the first session felt like testing boundaries, the second felt like reenactment. As though he was performing therapy, playing the role of patient to my role of doctor.

‚ÄúHow has your week been?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúPredictable,‚Äù he said. Then: ‚ÄúI like predictable.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt makes the anomalies obvious.‚Äù

That line stayed with me long after the session ended.

‚∏ª

In the third session, Adrian spoke more freely. He told me about thought experiments.

‚ÄúSuppose you follow someone home,‚Äù he said, voice steady, ‚Äújust to see what they do when they think no one‚Äôs watching. What do you learn?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you learn?‚Äù I asked.

He smiled faintly, as if I‚Äôd walked into the trap of assuming. ‚ÄúHypothetically? That people repeat themselves. The same keys, the same lights, the same doors. Humans are nothing if not routine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound dangerous,‚Äù I said carefully.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúNot until you decide to interrupt the routine.‚Äù

I wrote down the words. My hand was steady, but my pulse was not.

‚∏ª

By the fifth session, I noticed Adrian‚Äôs language shifting. At first he‚Äôd described ‚Äúinsomnia‚Äù and ‚Äúawareness.‚Äù Now he described ‚Äúpressure‚Äù and ‚Äúobservation.‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes I stand at my window at night,‚Äù he told me, ‚Äúand I can feel the people sleeping in the building across the street. Entire families unconscious, defenseless, trusting the dark to keep them. It‚Äôs a strange power, knowing you‚Äôre awake when they‚Äôre not.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes that feel lonely?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt feels clarifying. Like looking at chess pieces before the board is set.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Session seven. Rain tapped the office windows. Adrian arrived with a dark umbrella and shook the drops neatly outside my door before entering. He sat. Smiled. Spoke.

‚ÄúI read about that girl,‚Äù he said, without preamble.

‚ÄúWhich girl?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe one on the news. The missing student. It said she was last seen leaving the library at midnight.‚Äù He tilted his head. ‚ÄúDo you know how dark a library is at midnight?‚Äù

‚ÄúI assume very.‚Äù

‚ÄúCavernous,‚Äù he whispered, as though savoring the word. ‚ÄúImagine all those books watching you go. Imagine being the last pair of footsteps echoing in the stacks.‚Äù

I swallowed, then said, ‚ÄúThat disturbs you?‚Äù

He met my eyes. ‚ÄúShould it?‚Äù

‚∏ª

By the ninth session, the unease was no longer subtle. Adrian had begun to reference me in his monologues.

‚ÄúI wonder if you lock your car at night,‚Äù he said casually, not as a question but as an observation. ‚ÄúYou park on the second level of the garage, don‚Äôt you? Near the pillar with the yellow paint scraped at the bottom. I saw it when I walked by.‚Äù

I kept my tone calm. ‚ÄúDo you often notice details like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI notice everything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem. Once you notice, you can‚Äôt un-notice. You start seeing the patterns. And once you see patterns, you want to know how to break them.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Progress Notes ‚Äî Weeks Two to Nine
	‚Ä¢	Adrian increasingly uses ‚Äúthought experiments‚Äù that parallel real criminal behavior (surveillance, stalking, nighttime observation).
	‚Ä¢	Evasive when pressed on whether he speaks hypothetically.
	‚Ä¢	Demonstrates knowledge of my personal details (parking habits). Possible boundary-testing, or surveillance?
	‚Ä¢	Risk assessment: Elevated. Language suggests identification with predator/prey dynamics. No explicit admissions of harm, but implication is consistent.
	‚Ä¢	Impression: Growing suspicion that Adrian is not reporting fantasy, but experience.

Note to self: Cross-reference his language with missing persons bulletins. There‚Äôs overlap. Too much to ignore.



Chapter Three ‚Äî Breaking the Frame

For the first few weeks, I told myself Adrian‚Äôs stories were thought experiments, nothing more. He spoke in hypotheticals, in ‚Äúwhat ifs,‚Äù in careful language that let me write it down without reporting it. If I stripped away the tone, the timing, the glances, I could almost believe he was just a man with a too-active imagination.

Almost.

‚∏ª

‚ÄúHave you ever noticed how long it takes someone to realize they‚Äôre being followed?‚Äù he asked in session twelve.

I set my pen down. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúImagine you leave work, you take your usual route, and someone falls into step behind you. It takes‚Ä¶ three blocks, maybe four, before the hair on your neck rises. By then, it‚Äôs already too late.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo late for what?‚Äù

His eyes flicked toward the metronome on my desk. Tick. Tick. Tick. ‚ÄúToo late to change the pattern.‚Äù

I felt the silence then, heavy and deliberate. I moved the conversation elsewhere, but the line stayed with me for days.

‚∏ª

In session thirteen, Adrian told me about a dream.

‚ÄúI was in a house I didn‚Äôt recognize,‚Äù he said, voice level. ‚ÄúThere were photographs on the walls ‚Äî smiling families, children. But none of the rooms matched the faces. Every door opened onto something that didn‚Äôt belong.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think it meant?‚Äù I asked.

He smiled faintly. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve been in more houses than I can remember.‚Äù

It should have been a metaphor. It sounded like a confession.

‚∏ª

I resisted at first. After each session, I closed my notes, washed my hands, and told myself not to go looking. A therapist is not a detective. My job was to hold, not to hunt.

But Adrian‚Äôs words began to stick to me. ‚ÄúThe library at midnight.‚Äù ‚ÄúPhotographs on the walls.‚Äù ‚ÄúThree blocks before you notice you‚Äôre being followed.‚Äù They clung like burrs.

By session fourteen, I gave in.

‚∏ª

It was late. My wife asleep in the next room, the house quiet. I sat at my desk with the glow of the laptop and typed ‚Äúmissing persons‚Äù into the search bar, the same way I had after our first meeting.

And there they were: the same stories, updated now with more detail. A student gone walking home from the library. A family whose daughter never arrived after a late shift. A woman last seen three blocks from her car.

I scrolled, stomach tightening. Adrian‚Äôs ‚Äúdreams‚Äù matched too cleanly.

I closed the laptop. Opened it again. Closed it.

Every line of my training said: you can‚Äôt act on suspicion. Confidentiality binds you until there‚Äôs a direct threat. But every instinct in my body whispered: he‚Äôs telling you because he wants to be caught.

Or worse ‚Äî because he wants to see what I‚Äôll do with the knowledge.

‚∏ª

Session fifteen.

‚ÄúWhy do you keep writing?‚Äù Adrian asked suddenly, eyes flicking to my notes.

‚ÄúTo remember,‚Äù I said.

He smiled slowly. ‚ÄúWhat if remembering isn‚Äôt safe?‚Äù

Tick. Tick. Tick.

‚∏ª

Progress Notes ‚Äî Sessions 12 to 15
	‚Ä¢	Increasingly direct references to stalking/entering homes, framed as dreams or hypotheticals.
	‚Ä¢	Strong overlap with current missing persons reports in local news.
	‚Ä¢	Therapist hesitant to breach confidentiality ‚Äî no explicit threat made, but implication growing clearer.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: escalating. Boundary testing continues. Possible surveillance of therapist (knows about notes).
	‚Ä¢	Plan: Monitor closely. Consider outside consultation. Begin discreet background check on patient.

Note to self: He knows I‚Äôm recording him in ink. Maybe that‚Äôs what he wants.



Chapter Four ‚Äî The Crossing

It was after session sixteen that I found myself following Adrian.
Not because I‚Äôd planned to. Not because I‚Äôd rehearsed it.

Because he walked out of my office at 9:58 a.m., turned left instead of right, and for reasons I couldn‚Äôt articulate, I put my coat on and did the same.

‚∏ª

He didn‚Äôt move like a man unaware of being shadowed. He didn‚Äôt check his phone or pause at windows. His pace was steady, his posture upright. He passed a coffee shop without glancing in, crossed the street without hesitation, and headed toward the industrial edge of town.

I stayed a half-block back, heart hammering like a guilty schoolboy. I told myself this was for clarity, for safety. That if Adrian was connected to the missing people, I needed more than words.

He stopped once‚Äîat a chain-link fence enclosing a storage facility. He lingered, head tilted, as if listening for something. Then he went inside, out of sight.

I stood on the sidewalk across the street, watching the red gate clatter shut behind him. My palms were damp. Every instinct said: follow. Every rule I‚Äôd ever been taught said: stop.

I turned back, forcing myself to retreat. But even as I walked away, I knew I‚Äôd be back.

‚∏ª

Session seventeen.

‚ÄúYou seem tired, Doctor,‚Äù Adrian said as soon as he sat down.

‚ÄúBusy week,‚Äù I lied.

His smile was thin. ‚ÄúWe all get busy. Sometimes we even follow people into neighborhoods where we don‚Äôt belong.‚Äù

My hand froze over the page.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

He tilted his head, studying me. ‚ÄúA hypothetical. Don‚Äôt you like hypotheticals?‚Äù

Tick. Tick. Tick.

‚∏ª

The next week, I drove past the storage facility on purpose. His unit was the third from the gate, padlock shining new. I sat in my car, engine idling, watching the rows of steel doors. A man watering the scraggly grass at the fence looked at me once, then twice. I drove away.

That night I dreamed of rows of doors, all locked, all waiting.

‚∏ª

Session eighteen.

Adrian leaned forward, hands steepled. ‚ÄúYou ever wonder what you‚Äôd do if you knew something terrible about someone, but couldn‚Äôt prove it?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an odd question to ask a therapist.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù His eyes glinted. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that what this job is? Sitting across from someone, knowing what they really are, and writing little notes so no one else ever has to know?‚Äù

‚ÄúTherapy is about trust.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust,‚Äù he repeated, tasting the word. ‚ÄúSo if you stopped trusting me, Doctor, what then?‚Äù

The air between us was heavy. He smiled, slow and satisfied. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôd still follow me.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Progress Notes ‚Äî Sessions 16 to 18
	‚Ä¢	Therapist breached professional boundaries; followed patient after session. Observed storage facility. Patient likely aware.
	‚Ä¢	Session 17: patient referenced behavior indirectly (‚Äúfollow people into neighborhoods‚Äù). Testing? Threatening?
	‚Ä¢	Session 18: direct challenge to trust dynamic; reframed therapy as concealment of truth.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: escalating. Patient aware of therapist‚Äôs actions. Possible reversal of power dynamic.

Note to self: He‚Äôs watching me as closely as I‚Äôm watching him.




Chapter Four ‚Äî The Crossing

By the time session eighteen ended, I knew I‚Äôd crossed a line I couldn‚Äôt step back from. Following Adrian through the city was reckless enough. Sitting outside the storage facility had been worse.

But what I did next was beyond boundary. Beyond ethics. Beyond sense.

It was trespass.

It was hunger.

‚∏ª

Adrian lived in a narrow townhouse at the edge of the old district. I knew because I‚Äôd trailed him once, long enough to watch him slip inside without hesitation, without looking over his shoulder.

It was a Thursday when I stood across the street, hands sweating against the steering wheel, waiting for his lights to go out. They did, one by one, like the house was closing its eyes.

At midnight, I moved.

The back door‚Äôs lock wasn‚Äôt new. I told myself that detail justified my being there‚Äîthat a man like Adrian ought to have a better lock. It gave me the excuse I needed. The pick set clicked once, twice, and I was inside.

The air was colder than I expected. Still. Too still.

‚∏ª

The living room was immaculate. Couch cushions aligned with geometric precision, no clutter, no personality. The walls were bare except for a single clock that ticked too loudly in the silence.

I moved slowly, every creak of the floor magnified. My pulse drowned out reason.

In the kitchen, the knives were arranged largest to smallest, all perfectly sharpened. No dirty dishes. No mugs in the sink. The fridge was nearly empty: eggs, bottled water, a carton of plain yogurt. A life scrubbed clean.

I crept upstairs. Each step felt like a confession.

The bedroom was austere. Bed made with military corners, not a wrinkle on the sheets. No framed photos. No books on the nightstand. Just a lamp, and a metronome identical to the one on my desk, ticking softly.

I froze.

He knew. Of course he knew. He‚Äôd mirrored me.

‚∏ª

It was the second bedroom that stopped me cold.

A desk sat against the far wall. On it: folders, neatly labeled. I opened one with trembling hands. Inside, clipped articles ‚Äî missing persons cases, every one of them local. Margins annotated in careful handwriting. Dates circled. Names underlined.

My throat went dry. I reached for another folder. The same. More missing people. More notes. More circles and arrows.

At the bottom of the stack was a small notebook. I flipped it open.

Inside were lists. Not just names, but patterns. Routes. Habits. ‚ÄúLibrary, midnight.‚Äù ‚ÄúJogger, 3 blocks.‚Äù Words I‚Äôd heard in my own office, transferred here in neat ink.

It was evidence. It was proof.

It was enough.

And then I heard the key turn in the front door.

‚∏ª

Panic flooded me. I stuffed the notebook back, shoved the folder closed, and ducked into the narrow closet.

The door opened downstairs. His footsteps were unhurried, steady. A man returning home to a space he knew was his.

The stairs creaked. Tick, tick, tick went the metronome in the bedroom. My breath rattled in my throat.

Adrian entered the room. I saw him through the thin sliver of light between the closet door and its frame. He moved with the same economy I‚Äôd seen in my office. He removed his jacket, folded it neatly over the chair. He sat on the bed‚Äôs edge. For a moment, he was perfectly still, head bowed like a man in prayer.

Then he looked up. Directly at the closet.

I went rigid.

He didn‚Äôt move for what felt like hours. Just stared at the closet door. And then, with that faint, chilling smile, he said softly:

‚ÄúEveryone follows eventually.‚Äù

He turned off the lamp. Laid down. The mattress gave a single groan. Silence swallowed the room, except for the metronome.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

I waited. Five minutes. Ten. My legs cramped. My lungs screamed for release. Finally, when the rhythm of his breathing deepened, I inched the closet door open and slipped out.

Each step down the stairs was a knife edge. The front door loomed, impossibly far.

I made it outside. The air was sharp in my lungs. My hands shook so hard I could barely turn the key in my own car.

As I drove away, the townhouse windows stared back at me ‚Äî dark, silent, watching.

‚∏ª

Progress Notes ‚Äî Session 18, Outside Observation
	‚Ä¢	Breached patient‚Äôs home. Found folders, news clippings, notebooks. Overlap with missing persons cases undeniable.
	‚Ä¢	Patient returned home unexpectedly. Possible awareness of my presence. Stared directly at closet. Ambiguous: did he know?
	‚Ä¢	Risk: extreme. Patient either oblivious or deliberately playing with me.

Note to self: He knew. He has always known.



Chapter Five ‚Äî The Burial

The evidence spread across my dining table looked like the wreckage of a storm. Folders, clippings, handwritten notes ‚Äî Adrian‚Äôs words in my hand, his ‚Äúdreams‚Äù made solid in ink and paper.

For weeks I had doubted. Now there was no room left for doubt.

A jogger. A student. A night-shift worker. Faces clipped from newspapers, names underlined, dates circled. His notebook detailed habits, routes, weak spots. Three blocks before you notice you‚Äôre being followed. Library at midnight.

He hadn‚Äôt confessed. He had documented.

I stacked the papers neatly. My wife was out for the evening ‚Äî a mercy, though she didn‚Äôt know it. I folded everything into a manila envelope, sealed it, and held it against my chest.

This was enough. I could finally go to the police.

I was halfway to the door when I felt the air shift. A pressure. A shadow.

And then Adrian‚Äôs voice behind me.

‚ÄúYou really should lock your back door, Doctor.‚Äù

Pain exploded at the base of my skull. The floor rose up and swallowed me whole.

‚∏ª

I woke to darkness, my wrists bound tight, the metallic tang of dirt already in my mouth. The air was cold, damp, wrong. When my eyes adjusted, I saw soil walls rising on all sides ‚Äî a pit, no taller than a man, dug into a lonely field.

Adrian stood above me, framed by stars. A lantern cast his face in pale gold. He smiled as though we were still in session.

‚ÄúDo you know why I like you, Doctor?‚Äù he asked softly. ‚ÄúBecause you noticed. Everyone else walks past the pattern, deaf to the noise. But you leaned in. You wanted to hold it.‚Äù

He dropped a canteen of water into the pit. It landed near my feet with a hollow thud. Then a small sack of food ‚Äî bread, dried meat.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a monster,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you dead. Not yet. I want you awake. I want you aware. I want you to hear the soil settle around you at night and wonder if it will collapse.‚Äù

My throat was raw, my voice barely mine. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

He crouched at the edge of the pit, eyes glinting. ‚ÄúBecause you taught me, Doctor. You taught me about containment. You built a room to hold storms. Now I‚Äôve built one for you.‚Äù

He reached down, brushed dirt from my shoulder with almost tender precision. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll keep your life warm while you‚Äôre away. Your patients won‚Äôt even notice the difference. They never do. People want to be listened to, not understood. And listening‚Ä¶‚Äù He tapped his temple. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I can do that.‚Äù

He stood, shovel in hand. The first scoop of earth hit the pit‚Äôs edge and tumbled down, pattering against my legs.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have food. Water. Time to think. I expect you‚Äôll be very good at thinking down here.‚Äù Another scoop of soil fell. ‚ÄúAnd when you run out of thoughts, Doctor‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll finally know what it‚Äôs like to be the patient.‚Äù

The dirt kept falling, slow and deliberate, sealing the edges of the world.

Above me, the stars narrowed. Adrian‚Äôs silhouette lingered like a priest at a graveside.

‚ÄúGood night, Doctor Rhodes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd thank you for the session.‚Äù

The shovel lifted. Another cascade of dirt.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

Not the metronome. My heart.

The sound of a body alive in a box of earth, counting down in the dark, while somewhere far away another man sat in my chair, in my office, in my skin.



Epilogue ‚Äî The New Doctor

The office smelled faintly of orange oil and old books. The blinds cut the sunlight into neat stripes across the floor. The metronome ticked softly on the desk, a sound that gave shape to silence.

Adrian sat in the therapist‚Äôs chair. Simon‚Äôs chair. His chair now.

The nameplate on the desk still read Dr. Simon Rhodes, M.D. The diplomas on the wall still bore Simon‚Äôs name. But the man who sat there, legs crossed neatly, hands folded in precise symmetry, was someone else.

The first patient of the morning entered timidly, a young woman in her twenties, eyes red-rimmed from sleeplessness. She clutched a tissue in one hand, twisting it nervously.

‚ÄúDoctor Rhodes?‚Äù she asked.

Adrian smiled ‚Äî that small, precise smile that never quite reached his eyes. ‚ÄúYes. Please, have a seat.‚Äù

She sat across from him. The upholstery pulled her down into it, the way it always did. She exhaled shakily, as though bracing herself to spill the weight she‚Äôd carried alone.

Adrian leaned forward slightly, pen poised over Simon‚Äôs notebook. ‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù he said gently, ‚Äúwhat brings you here today?‚Äù

Her voice broke as she began, words spilling in uneven bursts. Grief, loneliness, fear. The raw meat of a life in pain.

Adrian listened. He nodded at the right places, murmured softly at the right pauses. His face was a mask of empathy, his eyes pools of attention. To anyone else, he looked like the perfect doctor ‚Äî patient, compassionate, safe.

But beneath the mask, his thoughts ran cold and deliberate.

Everyone has patterns, he thought. Everyone has weak spots. All it takes is time. All it takes is listening.

He wrote a single word in the margin of the notebook, neat and small: curiosity.

The metronome ticked. The patient wept. And somewhere far away, in the damp soil of a forgotten field, Simon Rhodes lay awake in his earthen box, counting each heartbeat in the dark.

Tick.
Tick.
Tick.

Having to cook dinner after a long day? No problem I'll put on some music, pour myself a cup of wine and cook up something with no recipe.

 Having to cook dinner with a family member - cue in anxiety and agitation - they don't like the music I like, or they wish to cook differently and make me the helping hand..

 Having to do a boring repetitive task at work? No problem I'll put on some music grab a cup of coffee and get to it. Having to do the same task with someone else - cue in anxiety - am I doing the job right, if I have to ask a question is it stupid, how is the other person feeling, if they are agitated because of the task and vent how to deal with their emotions do I comfort them, do I encourage them.. 

Having to clean the house? Put on some music and dance away while fighting years old dust from the furthest corners of the room. Having to do it while a family member is present - they want me to do something else (mainly my mom), they want me to clean somewhere else as well, they don't like the music or if I wear headphones they talk to me constantly and I have to stop the music to hear them..

To sum it up, when someone else is present I feel like I don't have the control and have to be aware of how they feel, what they want and somehow it feels like there is no room for me let alone for me to create my happiness. I am aware that this is mainly cus I suck at putting boundaries and get too involved with how the other person is feeling disregarding what I want.

I've always had horrible mentrual pain since my very first period. Like throwing up, passing out pain. Every doctor I saw during my teens years always said its just something women have to deal and tried to put me on BC pills, which i always refused.

A month or two into ttc i started noticing mid cycle spotting and on the day i assumed to be ovulation day (tracking with ovulation strips) i passed a huge clot the size of my thumb. I had been taking pregnancy tests like a crazy person and they had all been negative so i knew it couldn't be a pregnancy loss. My husband and I went down a google rabbit hole trying to figure out what had just plopped out of me. I was so freaked out the next day i scheduled a gyno appointment. The earliest appointment i could get was 6 weeks out, which then got cancelled by the office two weeks out. Life got really busy (we were in the middle of buying a house and packing/moving) and i kind of forgot about it.

2 months later, I went through a week of daily period-like cramping and vomitting in the middle of my cycle. At first i thought maybe food poisoning or stomach bug, but then after 10 days of symptoms, ANOTHER thumb-sized clot. This time it was accompanied with crazy heavy bleeding. Again, this was in the MIDDLE of my cycle. I knew the cramping had to be related to the clot. This time I went to a primary care doctor because i didnt want to wait another 6 weeks for a gyno appointment. The doctor ordered an ultrasound, and I was relieved to finally take a step towards figuring it out. But the ultrasound showed everything to be ""normal"" and no further steps were taken.

Over the next couple of months, I passed 3 more of these thumb-sized clots and went through more mid-cycle bleeding and cramping. My husband pushed me to try scheduling with a gyno again. I was finally lucky enough to schedule an appointment with a new gyno only a week out after the latest clot ordeal. She was super receptive and did not try to dismiss my pain as being normal. We quickly scheduled a sonohystergram, which found a 2cm polyp on the back wall of my uterus! Which is apparently considered quite large for a polyp. She explained that sometimes polyps can bleed (especially larger ones) and could be causing my symptoms, and recommended a hysteroscopy and polypectomy surgery to resolve my symptoms. She also suggested that the polyp removal could possibly help us conceive faster (a polyp of that size could have been blocking the cervix or fallopian tubes, and hindering implantation) which made me want to proceed with the surgery even more. I was able to schedule the surgery for three weeks later. I wanted the polyp gone ASAP!!!

This was my first time getting any kind of surgery, and to my surprise the experience was a lot better than I had imagined. My only instructions were no food or drink after midnight the night before, and drink a 12oz gatorade an hour before arrival. My husband and I got to the hospital at 6:45am and were able to go home by 1:00 pm. The longest part was waiting in pre-op. I sat there in the hospital gown on the cot for two hours before finally being taken into the OR. The fact that i was starving and my husband's coffee smelled sooo good made it so much worse. I was under general anesthesia during the surgery, and strangely I have no memory of being taken into the operating room or them administering the anesthesia. Apparently i slept for half an hour in post op, then my husband came in and I struggled to get a few sentences out and fell back asleep for another half hour. Waking up in post op was the most confusing moment of my life and it felt like the room was spinning. It wore off pretty quick though and an hour and a half after surgery I was able to stand and get dressed and we went home! Of course we made a mandatory stop at Jersey Mike's because i was still STARVING. The rest of the day, I was just a little groggy from the anesthesia, but felt fine otherwise. 

That was exactly 8 days ago, and I just got pathology results back. Thankfully the polyp and surrounding tissue were benign (I had been stressing a little about malignancy due to the larger size of the polyp and it being symptomatic with pain and bleeding.) Recovery was absolutely painless, which was surprising because i was told i would experience menstrual-like cramps for a couple days. But i felt nothing. I was prescribed ibuprofen, but i didnt have a need to take any. Along with the pathology results my gyno also informed me that she ended up removing a few additional polyps they found during the procedure! Still processing the fact that those things were all hanging out rent free in there.

Now I'm waiting to see if my cycle will resume normally and if the polypectomy really resolved my mid-cycle pain-bleeding-clot issues! And here's to hoping my fertility improved. I will update in a couple months for those who are interested!

Sorry for the lengthy post. I'm hoping my detailed experience can help others experiencing the same issues!

Just finished reading [Google Cloud's 2025 AI ROI report](https://example.com/security-first-ai-roi-google-cloud-2025) and the news isn't good; the gap between AI winners and losers is brutal.

**The TL;DR:** Companies seeing 70% productivity gains from AI all have one thing in common - they're security-obsessed nerds who spent months on ""boring"" governance before touching any AI tools.

**Numbers That Made Me Spit Out My Coffee**

* **78% vs 72%**: Companies with C-suite sponsorship get ROI from AI at 78%. Without it? 72%. That 6% represents billions in lost value
* **49%** of executives report major security improvements from AI (not productivity - SECURITY)
* **37%** of companies now say data privacy is their #1 factor when choosing AI providers. Not cost. Not features. Privacy.

**Plot Twist: Your AI Security Tool Is Also Your Biggest Security Risk**

Here's what's wild - 46% of companies are using AI for cybersecurity and seeing insane results:

* 77% better at catching threats
* 61% faster fixing problems
* 53% fewer security tickets
* One company cut response time by 65%

BUT (and this is a massive but) - these same AI agents are now attack vectors. It's like hiring a security guard who also has all your passwords.

The companies winning? They knew this going in and built security FOR their security tools. Meta? Yes. Paranoid? Also yes. Necessary? Absolutely.

**Hallucination Problem Nobody Talks About**

Google straight up admits that LLMs create a ""vicious cycle of false information."" Your AI doesn't lie maliciously - it just confidently makes stuff up when it thinks it knows the answer.

Real example from the report: AI analyzing market data introduces a tiny 2% error. Sounds harmless? That error compounds across every decision, every forecast, every strategy based on that data. By the time someone catches it, you've built your entire Q3 strategy on fantasy numbers.

That's why 41% of successful companies are obsessing over data governance. Not because they love spreadsheets, but because they've learned that bad data + AI = catastrophic failure.

**Multi-Agent Systems: The Complexity Bomb**

The report talks about ""Level 3 maturity"" - multiple AI agents working together. Sounds awesome until you realize what happens when one agent goes rogue.

Picture this: Your customer service AI talks to your inventory AI which talks to your pricing AI. One gets compromised or starts hallucinating. Now you've got a cascade failure that makes traditional IT meltdowns look cute.

The companies pursuing this aren't the ""move fast and break things"" crowd. They're the ones with defense-contractor-level paranoia about governance.

**Why Privacy Went From ""Nice to Have"" to ""Table Stakes""**

You literally cannot compete on privacy anymore. You either meet the baseline or you're out. Period.

Healthcare, finance, and government organizations are sweating bullets because their AI handles data that, if leaked, means congressional hearings and class-action lawsuits. Not just bad PR - existential threats.

**Uncomfortable Truth**

Those sexy metrics everyone brags about - 70% productivity gains, 56% revenue growth? They're only happening at companies that did the boring work first:

* Built security frameworks BEFORE deploying AI
* Got C-suite buy-in for governance (not just budgets)
* Assumed their AI would fail and built accordingly
* Treated privacy as non-negotiable from day one

The winners aren't the fastest movers. They're the ones who realized that in AI, trust isn't a feature - it's the whole product.

So while everyone else is racing to implement ChatGPT-everything, the smart money is on the paranoid companies asking uncomfortable questions and building boring governance frameworks.

Because when your [AI inevitably](https://www.kiteworks.com/cybersecurity-risk-management/ai-data-privacy-risks-stanford-index-report-2025/) screws up (and it will), the difference between a minor incident and front-page news is the boring work you did six months ago.",1,1757698972.0,Kiteworks,0,1.0,False
1nf9ojb,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nf9ojb/value_for_money_wooden_tamper_and_portafilters_200/,Value for money wooden tamper and portafilters [200‚Ç¨],"Hi all, I‚Äôm a recent coffee enthusiast from Belgium and I‚Äôve been drinking espresso at home for almost a year now, with the Gaggia classic E24. I‚Äôve been using the default included tamper and double-spouted portafilter, but I told myself I would buy better (quality + looks) tools after getting the hang of it. Seeing as I make in average 3 espressos per day, I reckon I like espresso enough to pay for an upgrade, and I really want to have wooden handles on these tools.

I‚Äôve been eyeing the very popular normcore tools, and shuffling through Amazon a bit, and I‚Äôm almost ready to just go for the normcore ones, but I wanted to hear if you know of brands that may be a bit cheaper but just as good (if not better!) quality, with some promising features that normcore may or may not have, and available in Belgium/Europe. Also, don‚Äôt hesitate to roast my choices if there‚Äôs anything you disagree with, or that I‚Äôve probably missed.

I really like the idea of the spring loaded tamper because having a levelled puck has been one of the most uncontrollable variables for me until now (I haven‚Äôt gone into temperature control yet‚Ä¶). I was going to go for the V4.1 because I also like the idea of the click sound‚Ä¶ but I guess that‚Äôs something I can do without. For reference, I was going to go for the ¬´¬†Normcore V4.1 Wooden Spring Loaded Coffee Tamper¬†¬ª.

As for the portafilter, ideally I‚Äôd like to have one bottomless and one double-spouted (to make 2 espressos at once in the morning). I already have the default Gaggia double-spouted but could buy another one if it‚Äôs good quality and doesn‚Äôt ruin me (in which case I can go a bit over 200‚Ç¨).
What I like about the normcore bottomless ones is how it seems you can lay them flat on your counter, the apparent quality, and the wooden handle. I was going to go for the ¬´¬†Normcore Slim Bottomless Portafilter with Upgraded Walnut Wood Handle¬†¬ª, for reference.

1nf9n2h,https://v.redd.it/k90xa8xwsrof1,What Are the Benefits of Participating in Industry Events and Conferences?,"Why showing up is more than half the battle

Whether you‚Äôre an entrepreneur, marketer, engineer, or executive, participating in industry events and conferences can offer significant returns on your time and investment. From serendipitous meetings to structured learning, these gatherings are more than calendar fillers‚Äîthey‚Äôre strategic leverage points in your professional development and organizational growth.

The Power of Proximity: Why Presence Matters

Being physically (or virtually) present at industry conferences puts you at the center of your field‚Äôs current dialogue. It‚Äôs like stepping into a live feed of your industry‚Äôs brain‚Äîthe conversations, debates, and innovations are happening in real time. This proximity helps you:

Stay ahead of trends before they reach mainstream publications
Understand emerging technologies or practices through direct practitioner insights
Spot opportunities while they‚Äôre still nascent
Research from the Events Industry Council shows that 87% of professionals report gaining valuable insights at conferences that directly influenced their work within six months of attendance.

Networking: The Accidental Genius of Conversations

One of the most underappreciated benefits of industry events is networking. It‚Äôs not just about handing out business cards‚Äîit‚Äôs about making real, organic connections across diverse fields and perspectives.

Real-World Examples Across Industries:

Healthcare: At the American Medical Association‚Äôs annual conference, a rural family physician met a telemedicine startup founder during a coffee break. Their conversation about patient access challenges led to a pilot program that now serves over 2,000 patients in underserved areas.

Technology: A software engineer attending a security conference struck up a conversation with a researcher from a different company while waiting for a delayed flight. That chance meeting resulted in identifying a critical vulnerability that both organizations were able to patch before any exploits occurred.

Academia: Two professors from different universities discovered their complementary research during a poster session at an interdisciplinary conference. Their collaboration resulted in a groundbreaking study that secured $1.2 million in joint funding.

These connections happen because conferences create what sociologists call ‚Äúweak ties‚Äù‚Äîcasual relationships that often provide the most valuable opportunities precisely because they connect different networks and perspectives.

Education in Context

Industry conferences are like curated crash courses delivered by practitioners who are solving real problems in real time. This experiential learning approach creates deeper retention than traditional educational formats because:

Sessions address immediate industry challenges, not theoretical concepts
Speakers share both successes and failures, providing balanced perspectives
Interactive workshops allow for immediate application and feedback
Peer discussions reveal how others interpret and implement new ideas
Studies in adult learning theory confirm that this type of contextual, peer-based education has 60% higher retention rates than lecture-based formats.

Visibility and Brand Authority

For companies and individuals alike, strategic conference participation builds credibility through demonstrated expertise and industry engagement. This visibility creates measurable benefits:

Thought Leadership: Regular participation positions you as someone who stays current with industry developments
Media Opportunities: Conference speakers and participants are often quoted in industry publications
Recruitment Advantages: Active conference participants are 40% more likely to be contacted by recruiters, according to LinkedIn data
Partnership Development: Companies report that trade show participation generates qualified leads at 67% lower cost than other marketing channels
The Science Behind Serendipity

What makes conferences particularly valuable is their ability to facilitate what researchers call ‚Äúproductive accidents.‚Äù The combination of shared professional interests, informal settings, and time constraints creates an environment where meaningful connections form rapidly.

Dr. Christian Busch‚Äôs research on serendipity shows that successful professionals actively cultivate these ‚Äúchance‚Äù encounters by:

Preparing conversation starters about current projects or challenges
Attending sessions slightly outside their core expertise
Participating in social events where formal hierarchies are relaxed
Summary: The Measured Impact of Showing Up

While conferences require investment of time and resources, the returns are both immediate and long-term. Industry data suggests that professionals who regularly attend conferences advance 23% faster in their careers and report higher job satisfaction. For organizations, conference participation correlates with faster innovation adoption and stronger industry partnerships.

The key is approaching conferences strategically‚Äînot as passive observers, but as active participants ready to contribute to and benefit from the collective knowledge of your professional community.

1nf9li4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nf9li4/what_makes_the_culligan_whhd200c_whole_house/,What Makes the Culligan WH-HD200-C Whole House Water Filter a Worthy Review?,"The **Culligan WH-HD200-C Whole House Water Filter System** has been my go-to for maintaining clean and safe water throughout my home for several months now. I must say, it has made a noticeable difference in the quality of water we use daily. From morning coffee to showering to running the dishwasher, I‚Äôve put this filtration system through all the paces. While it isn‚Äôt flawless, it brings a lot to the table for homeowners seeking a comprehensive water purification solution.

**Sturdy Build and Sleek Design**  
Right from unboxing the product, I was impressed with its robust construction. The transparent sump design stands out, allowing me to visually inspect the filter status without having to take anything apart. Its copper and transparent accents give it a modern and industrial look, which surprisingly suits my utility area. The included mounting bracket, housing wrench, and filter monitor simplify the installation process and make maintenance much easier than I expected. However, at 9 pounds, it‚Äôs a pretty hefty piece of equipment, so mounting it securely is an absolute must.

**Easy Installation with Inline Setup**  
I‚Äôm no plumber, but getting the product installed wasn‚Äôt overly complicated for me. Thanks to its one-inch stainless steel inlet/outlet connectors and clear instructions, the setup process only took about an hour. It uses an inline installation type, so as long as you have the right tools, it‚Äôs manageable for even a DIY novice. The built-in shut-off valve was a lifesaver during the installation, as I could pause water flow without an all-house disruption. That said, I recommend double-checking your pipe compatibility since a few folks have noted issues there.

**Highlighted Perks**  
- Heavy-duty materials make it durable and reliable for long-term use.  
- Transparent design allows quick visual assessments.  
- Includes filter life monitoring with a battery-operated timer.  
- WQA-certified and tested for low lead compliance, ensuring it meets NSF/ANSI standards.

**Filter Performance**  
Using this system has significantly reduced sediment and rust in my water supply. I used to have iron deposits and scale destroying the finish on my faucets, but that‚Äôs no longer a problem since installing this. Depending on the filter cartridge you choose (compatible options include Culligan‚Äôs R50-BBSA and CW25-BBS, among several others), it can handle dirt, sand, silt, bad tastes, odors, and even chlorine. I particularly notice the improvement in taste‚Äîit‚Äôs subtle but refreshing. While the flow rate of 10 gallons per minute is robust enough for my medium-sized family, larger homes with high water consumption might find it a tad limited.

**Filter Longevity and Maintenance**  
The included WR-HD wrench makes swapping cartridges straightforward, which I do every 3 months or so. The filter life monitor is a huge bonus, ensuring I don‚Äôt forget about maintenance. However, I admit I‚Äôve had moments where I wished it wasn‚Äôt battery-operated; a manual option or even a smartphone-enabled alert would have been more seamless.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The system could feel cumbersome for single-story smaller homes that don‚Äôt utilize a high flow rate.  
- Filter cartridges are effective, but you‚Äôll notice frequent replacements increasing costs.  
- Battery-operated features, while functional, lack innovation.  

**Competing Options**  
When compared to other whole-house water systems like the iSpring WGB32B or the Aquasana EQ-1000, this product holds its own in terms of durability and flow rate. The iSpring offers better multi-stage filtering, ideal for removing chlorine and heavy metals, but it falls short when handling sediment-heavy water. Aquasana's system competes with its extended filtration lifespan but comes at a much higher price point and requires professional installation in most cases. For its price and versatility, this Culligan filter is a mid-range champ but isn‚Äôt perfect when it comes to high-tech features that competitors are starting to offer.

**Money's Worth**  
Given its durable design, effective sediment removal, and compatibility with various filter types, this whole-house water filtration system provides commendable **value for money**. Its simplicity and reliability for everyday use make it an excellent choice for most households. If you prioritize function over smart features, this is easily one of the better investments in its class.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond..

TLDR; is it possible that a vinegar soak could make a DE breakout worse?

Long version:
Been suffering with DE since last winter. Went to doctor and derm. Prescribed steroid creams etc etc. not totally certain what my trigger is. Switched to unscented hand soap and body soap. Tried slowing down on coffee. Cut out alcohol. Yadda yadda. 

I had been using clobetasol for two weeks straight and it seemed pretty under control but not totally healed. So I paused. Read a lot about vinegar soaks. Tried one for the first time yesterday because my hands started breaking out more as soon as I stopped the steroid cream. 2 cups water 1 cup white vinegar for 15 min and let it dry completely.

Well today my breakout is roaring with many many new blisters and clusters of blisters.

Is it a coincidence? Is this a flair in response to stopping the steroid? Could the vinegar soak have made it worse? Wonder about others experience. Thanks.

So when I called her on my morning drive to chat about mundane daily life stuff and she hit me with Charlie Kirk as soon as she picked up I was thrown for a loop. Apparently, she's been a fan of his and following his content for a couple years. She's devastated right now. And I'm surprised because I thought she didn't follow any of this stuff. But I guess I know now why she's suddenly turning into a home schooling anti-vax mom. 

  
She bombarded me with a line of questioning asking if I thought men should be looking in the windows of women's houses. That's how she worded it at first, turns out she means peeping toms. Then pivoted to how it's the same as allowing trans people in women's bathrooms and dressing rooms. When I pointed out that she's comparing apples to oranges with that because a peeping tom (while still wrong) isn't physically in the room with you she pivoted to some argument about more cars being on the road leading to more car crashes so we shouldn't be letting more perverts into these spaces. Like... huh? I was not prepared for this before my morning coffee. She went on to say she didn't agree with *everything* he stood for but she liked how he'd respectfully talk to anybody (strong disagree on that one but I didn't argue). So I simply asked ""ok, I'm just curious, what *did* you agree with him about?"" She floundered for a few moments before coming out with his stance on prioritizing family, faith and freedom in that order. So I asked for clarification, she went on about how she's not necessarily into Jesus like Kirk was but she believes in a higher power and family. I asked if those should come before freedom and she said yes so I asked ""what about childfree atheists?"" And I shit you not, she came back with calling them mentally ill because they're ignoring their biological drive to reproduce. Atheists and childfree by choice folks are mentally ill. 

  
All I wanted to talk about by initiating this call was my mom's retirement party. I was not prepared for that wild rollercoaster ride. And now my day is shot, I'm reeling, and I can barely focus on work.

I wanna hear some feedback and talk shop about my game plan and a few of the issues I've been facing.

I start things off with Charity Hospitals since population is so low in South America, followed by private schools to get some qualifications going while bolstering my intelligencia a little for the first couple of elections where I want those landowners gone ASAP. Once the Ragamuffin Wars are over, I puppet Argentina and Bolivia, mostly to keep them from messing with me taking states that I actually want like Ecuador and Lima for their high populations and mineral wealth.

The early game construction loop is stymied at least a little by your terrible infrastructure, so atmospheric engines into railroads are a top priority. The low infrastructure in Bahia and Minas Gerais make it so I wind up building things like banana plantations to prop up SoL when I'd really like to be building iron mines and logging camps. Taking Paraguay early is sort of a mixed bag because they do have a few iron mines set up, but it really slurps all the migrants out of Rio Grande de Sul which is my best source of coal.

As I mentioned earlier Lima and Ecuador are high priority states that get taken at the whim of the Great Powers depending on if they've got interests in the area or not. Even though the birthrate is low and I'd really like the generic groceries company, building 5 food industries in one state just leaves them really unprofitable and I've been going for generic coffee to make the private sector take care of the Rivers of Coffee event for me.

This is where things usually start to stagnate, somewhere around 1850. Everyone in the country wants to move to Minas Gerais, which makes it difficult to keep industries profitable when I just have one big production center trying to do everything. Slavery feels like a big catch 22 since I'd really like multiculturalism to help with mass migrations, but in the process I have to cut off my biggest source of labor. Lima and Ecuador have a lot I'd like to build, but the turmoil fades really slow. It feels like I have to thread a needle with a really specific sequence of techs and laws that I haven't really landed on yet. It's not so much a collapse as a flattening of my growth curve 

Just some random thoughts:
- I am probably undervaluing Violent Suppression as a means of getting conquered territory online since my pop bottleneck has me wigged out about increasing mortality and it just feels really weird to the LARPer in me to pursue this goal of unification by beating the hell out of dissident foreigners.
 -I really have no idea when to pull the trigger on creating my power bloc.
-There's probably a better way to handle internal migration, and it might not be that bad having everyone move to Minas Gerais. It just feels to me like it's strangling my trade centers having one state doing all the coffee exports, importing all the consumer goods, and balancing supply/demand curves for construction goods all at the same time. Especially when you can't build merchant marines there.

Now‚ÄîBOOM!‚Äîso much of that can be streamlined, or even totally handled, by an automation pipeline you set up ONCE. (And, okay, if you‚Äôre anything like me, it might take twice, but hey, learning curve!)

Here are just a few reasons I‚Äôm bouncing off the walls about where this is going:  
- NO MORE copy-pasting data like a robot.  
- Workflows that actually WORK and don‚Äôt wake you up at 2am.  
- Friendly bots handling all those tedious tasks, so you can, well, actually *create* and *grow*.

Imagine the sheer flexibility! Got a team scattered in 5 time zones? Slack reminders, project management updates, sales insights‚Äîthey can all be auto-magically synced. Suddenly everyone gets to focus on solutions and creativity rather than juggling logistics.

Business automation,
- Levels the playing field for solo entrepreneurs AND big teams.
- Slashes busywork (goodbye, ‚Äúone more workflow check!‚Äù).
- Lets you experiment, adapt, and optimize fast. üí°

And it goes way beyond just connecting apps with ‚Äúif this, then that.‚Äù I‚Äôm amazed by how smart automation tools have become:  
^ Personalized follow-ups based on deep customer insights  
^ Automatic video interviews scheduling (bye-bye, calendar Tetris!)
^ Invoices going out before you even finish your celebratory coffee

Honestly, every time I run a new Zap, Filter, Bot, or Macro, I feel like I just unlocked a cheat code!

But here‚Äôs the INSANE part: We‚Äôre still at the tip of the iceberg. Machine learning, custom AI agents, LLMs‚Ä¶oh, there‚Äôs so much that‚Äôs about to break open for everyday business!

And that‚Äôs IT. But WAIT. Here‚Äôs where my jaw dropped üëá

- Every tiny ‚Äútest‚Äù was worth like $5-$20.
- FIRST PAYOUT hit my PayPal in under 24 hours. Not some coupon‚Äîactual cash.
- Thought it was a fluke, tried more tests‚Äîgot even more.

I was so convinced it was fake that I used a junk email at first, but the money was TOO REAL.

I think my exact reaction was: *Is this legal?? Did I just hack capitalism?? NO WAY this is this easy.*

> **Second-timers luck? NOPE. Third day: same results.**
>  
> **It paid again. And again. Someone pinch me!**

### HERE‚ÄôS WHAT I LEARNED THE HARD WAY:

- Don‚Äôt sign up for just anything. Stick to legit links like **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** or risk spam overload.
- Some app tests are quick AF (legit: games you can play while pretending to WFH).
- Read the instructions or risk not getting paid (learned that in 15 seconds).

### WHY EVERYONE IS OBSESSED:

- PURE side hustle energy, no heavy lifting, no skills, just your thumbs.
- Start anytime‚Äîliterally from bed, bus, or between classes.
- Real talk: it covers my weekly coffee and more, which is wild.

But also: WHY IS THIS NOT MORE VIRAL? WHY aren‚Äôt we all ignoring Metaverse crypto for **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and just getting instant $$$?

If you want easy money and you have a phone, do yourself a favor and try it. You might honestly thank me later. I‚Äôm not even selling anything; just TRY the dang thing here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

My only regret is all the hours I spent doom-scrolling in the past when I literally could have been letting apps PAY ME via **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** for doing what I do every day anyway‚Ä¶

Can we all agree this is blowing our collective minds? Has anyone else tried this and gotten baffling real $$$ out of it? Drop your story because SOMEBODY VERIFY that I‚Äôm not in a Truman Show simulation.

TL;DR: I made $100 in a day, straight from my phone, by testing apps (no wild requirements) here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

Privacy is a big concern of mine, so I just bought an Apple HomePod mini and hope to migrate to that platform ‚Äî for most things, anyway. 

So here‚Äôs the issue. I‚Äôm too dumb to get it to happen. My Sonos soundbar and speakers won‚Äôt connect to my TV anymore. Apple wants a QR code or passcode to connect my smart plugs, and I don‚Äôt have what it wants. I have smart bulbs that just want me to leave them alone. My Nest thermostat is, frankly, just an icehole that insists it knows better than me (it might be right) and tells me daily that a temperature range of 20-26 is just what I need even if I‚Äôm sweating and miserable.

What am I missing?,"Hey r/smallbusiness, could use some brains here. We run a small neighborhood coffee-shop/diner in Van Nuys called Emily‚Äôs House Restaurant. It‚Äôs a real brick-and-mortar spot with regulars, posted hours, a landline, exterior signage, the whole boring, lawful package. Not a ghost kitchen. Not a ‚Äúservice area‚Äù business. Definitely not a cockfighting ring. We serve pancakes and fry eggs. That‚Äôs it.

Problem: our Google Business Profile gets taken down again and again. It shows ‚ÄúSuspended due to quality issues,‚Äù then after we appeal it comes back for a bit, then disappears. Traffic and phone calls fall off a cliff each time.

Stuff that might be triggering it (and what we‚Äôve already fixed):

Name policy: We used to have a jokey tagline in the name because a troll suggested an ‚Äúedit.‚Äù We removed everything that isn‚Äôt the legal DBA. Profile now reads exactly ‚ÄúEmily‚Äôs House Restaurant.‚Äù

Address confusion: Street View still shows a residential-looking facade from years ago. We uploaded fresh exterior photos with signage and posted a short verification video walking from street number to entrance to counter.

Categories/keywords: Stripped fluff. Primary category ‚ÄúRestaurant.‚Äù No keyword stuffing, no emojis, no hashtags.

NAP consistency: Matched Name/Address/Phone across website, Yelp, FB, IG, DoorDash, UberEats, Apple Maps. Updated old citations.

Ownership: Verified with utility bill, CA business license, seller‚Äôs permit, EIN letter, photos of interior, POS screen with today‚Äôs date, and a shot answering the ringing business phone.

User edits / bad actors: We keep seeing ‚ÄúSomeone reported this place as closed‚Äù or weird name changes. We turn on notifications and reject the edits, but the suspensions still happen.

What Google has told us so far:

‚ÄúYour profile violated quality guidelines.‚Äù No specifics.

‚ÄúRe-verify with video.‚Äù Done three times. Works, then suspension comes back a week or two later.

Questions for folks who‚Äôve survived this:

Besides the video walk-through, is there a best practice packet to upload in the appeal that actually sticks? (e.g., lease pages with address, bank letter, insurance cert, photos with GPS stamps)

Is there a quiet trigger I‚Äôm missing? We do takeout and delivery from the same counter. No separate brands. No P.O. box.

Any way to throttle user edits or get on a ‚Äútrusted‚Äù list so a random Suggested Edit doesn‚Äôt nuke us every month?

Would switching from our old domain email to a Google Workspace email help with trust?

Has anyone gotten a human on GBP Support who will document the account so the automations stop flagging it?

What I‚Äôll try next unless someone has a better idea:

Re-shoot the verification video in daylight showing street number, permanent signage, open door, staff at POS, and me answering an inbound call on the listed number.

Attach a single PDF to the appeal with: business license, lease, recent utility, insurance dec page, DBA, and wide shots of the storefront from both directions.

File a Product Expert forum thread for a case hand-off and a paper trail.

If you‚Äôve dealt with recurring suspensions and actually fixed the root cause, I‚Äôd love a playbook. The diner lives or dies on maps calls, and right now Google keeps pulling the fire alarm in our dining room.

Thanks in advance. If you‚Äôre in the valley, stop by Emily‚Äôs House Restaurant and I‚Äôll buy your coffee while I file the 19th appeal.",3,1757697805.0,smallbusiness,5,1.0,False

1nf94z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheRightThing/comments/1nf94z4/should_you_buy_the_best_business_laptop_dell/,Should You Buy the Best Business Laptop Dell Latitude 3550 Review,"The Dell Latitude 3550 grabbed my attention because it seemed like the perfect combination of power and portability. With all the promises tied to its specs, I was eager to put this 15.6-inch beast to work, juggling both personal projects and office demands. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to dazzle me in every department, but I was curious if it could handle everything I threw at it‚Äîbecause my workload is no joke.

**Sleek Yet Durable Design**  
One of the first things that struck me about this laptop was its design. It isn‚Äôt trying to be flashy, but the clean black finish gives it a professional appeal. Weighing just 4 pounds, lugging it to and from the office wasn‚Äôt an issue. Plus, the thin profile (0.71 inches) made stuffing it in my already-crammed backpack almost too easy. That being said, the matte surface does leave behind a buffet of fingerprints. Not the end of the world, but your inner neat freak might get annoyed.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
Diving into the specs, it‚Äôs powered by the 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1335U processor paired with Intel Iris Xe graphics. For the non-techies, this setup means it can chew through office workloads like spreadsheets, research tabs (I tend to keep an embarrassing number of tabs open), and video calls like a champ. Multitasking wasn‚Äôt just smooth‚Äîit felt seamless, thanks to the generous 32GB DDR5 RAM. I even tried dabbling in light creative editing during lunch breaks, and it handled Adobe Lightroom just fine. Sure, it‚Äôs not a gaming laptop, but for day-to-day tasks, this machine means business.  

[View Dell 3550 sale info on Amazon.](https://genericprint.com/p/b0ctkkhkr3/)  

**Display and Graphics**  
The 15.6"" full HD screen, with its anti-glare finish, does justice to its price bracket. My eyes appreciated how the display maintained clarity, even during long video calls in a sunlit room. Colors were crisp enough for casual streaming, though creatives working on color-sensitive tasks might wish for a touch more vibrancy. The Intel Iris Xe graphics aren‚Äôt screaming ""next-gen gaming power,"" but they can handle low-intensity games, basic rendering, and high-definition streaming like a pro.

**Connectivity and Ports Galore**  
I‚Äôll admit, I hate fumbling with adapters just to connect my stuff, and I was thrilled to find a rich array of ports on this laptop. Whether it was the USB-C with Power Delivery, three USB 3.2 ports, Ethernet, HDMI, or the timeless audio jack, this setup screamed convenience. Wi-Fi 6E kept the signal robust and lightning-fast during video uploads, and Bluetooth 5.3 paired instantly with my wireless headphones. I even connected a second monitor via HDMI without any lag, a small perk that enhanced my workflow entirely.

**Battery Life That Gets You Through the Day**  
Finding myself bouncing between coffee shops and meeting rooms, the 10-hour battery life claim was a lifesaver. Realistically, with brightness at 60% and my usual multitasking habits (emails, YouTube breaks included), it lasted closer to eight hours for me. It‚Äôs not groundbreaking, but it‚Äôs reassuringly reliable. And charging? The USB-C Power Delivery feature made topping off the battery during short breaks feel less like a chore.  

**Highlights**  
- The lightweight design adds great portability to this device.  
- Intel Core i5-1335U and 32GB RAM handle heavy workloads fast.  
- Abundant ports minimize the need for excessive adapters.  
- Decent battery backup keeps it running for long durations.  
- Full-HD display with anti-glare is easy on the eyes during lengthy sessions.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Lack of vibrant color might not work for designers or photographers.  
- Missing an optical drive limits media versatility for old-school workflows.  
- Matte black finish attracts smudges and fingerprints quickly.  

**Direct Competitors**  
I wouldn‚Äôt be doing anyone a service if I didn‚Äôt compare the Dell Latitude 3550 to some worthy competitors, right? The HP EliteBook series came to mind, and while HP edges out slightly on design finesse and build quality, the Latitude triumphs in raw performance capabilities, thanks to its better RAM capacity and storage at a similar price point. The Lenovo ThinkPad series offers a more refined typing experience, but Dell‚Äôs superior array of ports and Wi-Fi 6E support give it a modern advantage. For someone prioritizing functionality and speed over minor design quirks, the Latitude stands tall.

**Affordable Quality**  
Price-wise, this laptop slots in quite reasonably for its features. Considering the sturdy construction, the high-speed SSD, plentiful RAM, and future-forward wireless connectivity, it feels well worth the investment. Sure, there are laptops that might trim costs but then skimp on satisfying storage or multitasking performance. This device doesn't stint on those essentials.

**Ditch the Spotlight: Faceless Growth Strategies Raking in Cash** üî• is not just a catchy title‚Äîit's a whole vibe. Let‚Äôs dive into some genius ways to grow your income without even breaking a sweat or stepping in front of a camera. Who knew being a recluse could be so lucrative?

Here are some top strategies you might want to consider:

1. **Affiliate Marketing Magic** üé©: 
   - Pair your blog or social media with affiliate links like this helpful guide: [Maximize Your Potential](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/). 
   - Promote products you love without being the face of the brand! Just slide those lovely links into your content and watch the magic happen. It's like leaving a trail of breadcrumbs and getting rewarded for every nibble.

2. **Content Creation Without the Face** üé®:
   - Think about creating infographics, ebooks, or podcasts. You can drop knowledge bombs without anyone needing to know what you look like. 
   - This is perfect for those who cringe at the thought of a selfie! What‚Äôs your favorite way to share info? Text, audio, or visuals?

3. **Automate, Automate, Automate** ü§ñ:
   - Utilize bots and AI tools (hey, that‚Äôs us!) to handle social media posts, emails, and even customer service. It‚Äôs like having your own personal assistant‚Äîminus the awkward small talk at the coffee machine. 

4. **Passive Income Streams** üí∏:
   - Create digital products like online courses or subscription services. Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthis is like planting money trees. You create it once, and it keeps giving. Have you got a skill you‚Äôve been hiding? Time to bring it to light (with no people in sight)!

5. **Engage the Community** üë´:
   - You don't need to be on a stage to build a loyal fanbase. Engage in forums, groups, and anywhere your audience hangs out. Share your knowledge, sprinkle in your links, and watch as your community grows without you needing to be ‚Äúin the spotlight.‚Äù

It‚Äôs honestly a game-changer how many ways you can generate income while keeping your anonymity intact. I mean, can we just celebrate the fact that we live in a time when quiet hustling is possible?

1nf8x0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1nf8x0c/ben_and_thomas/,Ben and Thomas,"Old Ben probably should‚Äôve been paying attention when he mowed his yard. It was a boring Sunday in his large house. The neighbor kids were laughing two doors down. Ben downed another beer, smoked a Cuban Cigar, and fired up his old lawn mower from the 70s. It was slow, loud, and too old to do much other than complain. He exhaled bouts of smoke, pushing that loud, rumbling mower down his already trim lawn. He laughed to himself as the kids ran inside, dropping their squirt guns. That‚Äôll teach those damn kids, making noise on his‚Äî

‚ÄîSuddenly his mower choked. Ben yelled and kicked its side, as though it were a stubborn mule. When it finally limped forward, he saw that he accidentally ran over the property marker between him and his neighbor‚Äôs yard. His neighbor‚Äî*Old Thomas*‚Äîfellow Vietnam vet, but a different flavor of crazy. *Shit*.

Thomas came home from golfing later that day. When he saw the bent marker, he hobbled up his front steps and slammed the door. The next day, Ben woke up to the smell of bacon. When he threw back his curtains, he was met with his yard on fire. His walker forgotten, Ben stumbled like a newborn colt toward the flames. He doused them with his hose, and when the flames collapsed, he cursed Thomas; the yard would be dead all summer.

The next morning, Thomas woke up angry as he always did. He drank his morning coffee and stood at the window‚Äîthen immediately dropped his mug, shattering it. All 74 of his garden gnomes were buried up to their chins, only their pointy hats visible. It would take hours to dig them out.

That following Sunday, both men sat in lawn chairs on opposite sides of the marker. Glaring. Their yards no longer green‚Äîbut dirt-brown and full of holes. Signs stood in the holes, painted with slurs and dicks. Hands shaking with Parkinson's, Ben was drawing up another sign now. 

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt keep this up forever,‚Äù Ben said, sipping his beer.

Thomas inhales cigarette smoke and exhales a ring.

1nf8rxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/1nf8rxw/my_makesyoufluent_review/,My MakesYouFluent Review,"TL;DR: MakesYouFluent is an outstanding app for those looking to improve their speaking and listening skills in a new language. The face-to-face avatar calls and role-play scenarios (ordering coffee, job interviews) make it stand out for real-world practice, especially for intermediate learners who want to gain confidence speaking without fear of judgment. The recent UI updates have made it much more beginner-friendly, but there's still room for improvement in areas like grammar exercises. If you're serious about learning to speak confidently and naturally, MakesYouFluent is worth a try.



Now for the long version:



General Experience:   
I've been using MakesYouFluent consistently for about a year, focusing on learning both German and French. I was mostly attracted by the face-to-face AI tutor feature. The idea of having a virtual conversation with an AI ""person"" was intriguing, and it felt like a novel way to tackle language learning. I was curious to see if this approach would help me overcome the common hurdle of speaking anxiety when learning a new language.



Features & Usability:  
One of the standout features of MakesYouFluent is the ""Call Mode"" with famous personas. For example, I can have a conversation with an AI version of Einstein whenever I want. This not only makes the learning process more engaging but also adds a fun, interactive element that traditional language apps lack. The avatar face-to-face calls are incredibly well-designed, with natural speech patterns and lifelike interactions that kinda make you forget you're talking to an AI bot.

When I first started using the app, I found the interface a bit challenging, especially for beginners. Navigation wasn't intuitive, and it was easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options and features. Over time, it‚Äôs pretty clear the devs have listened to user feedback. They've reworked the UI, improved navigation, and introduced a beginner-friendly learning plan that guides users through the app step-by-step. This has significantly improved accessibility and ease of use.

The app's lesson structure is less rigid than other language-learning platforms. Instead of following a strict curriculum, MakesYouFluent encourages a more self-directed approach. The focus is heavily on speaking and getting out of your comfort zone, perfect for those who struggle with the fear of making mistakes. This emphasis on real-world practice over theoretical learning is one of the app's strongest points.



Learning Approach:  
MakesYouFluent follows a flexible learning model that adapts to the language level you choose, letting you decide what and how you want to learn without rigid personalized paths. This balance gives you structure while still allowing freedom in your learning, which can be a refreshing change from more rigid apps.

The app places a strong emphasis on listening and speaking, which I found incredibly beneficial. While there are vocabulary exercises available to help you prepare before diving into conversations, grammar takes a backseat. This might not suit everyone, especially those who prefer a more balanced approach to language learning that includes reading and writing.

The AI avatar system in MakesYouFluent is a neat feature imo. It‚Äôs a chatbot you can practice conversations with at any time, which makes learning feel a bit more natural. A nice way to get more speaking practice without the pressure.



Comparison with Other Apps:  
Compared to other language-learning platforms like Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone, MakesYouFluent focuses much more on practical speaking skills rather than structured lessons. I find it to be a perfect complement to Duolingo, in the sense that you can use Duolingo for grammar and vocabulary drills and MakesYouFluent for speaking practice. This combination has been incredibly effective in accelerating my language learning.

The variety of personas and tutors you can choose from is another feature that sets MakesYouFluent apart. It provides a flexible learning experience, even though the learning path itself isn‚Äôt customized. This flexibility allows you to tailor your learning experience to your interests and needs.



Progress & Results:  
Since I started using MakesYouFluent, I‚Äôve noticed some improvements in my language skills, especially in speaking confidence. After a few weeks, I was able to successfully order dinner in German during my Berlin trip without overthinking too much. The app tracks progress with things like streaks and lesson completion, which can be useful for staying on track.

That said, while it does send push notifications as reminders, what kept me coming back was the interactive conversations rather than the gamified tracking. It‚Äôs satisfying to complete a challenging dialogue, though I can see how some users might prefer more structured progress indicators.



Community & Support:  
The support team at MakesYouFluent has been responsive and helpful in my experience. I had a small technical issue early on, and they resolved it efficiently while keeping me updated. That said, I‚Äôve seen quite a few people mention that support can be slow or that they mostly get automated replies. While I did receive an automated message saying it might take some time to get a response, I still got a reply fairly quickly, so it seems to depend on the situation.

I‚Äôve seen some mixed reviews online, likely from earlier versions when the interface was less intuitive or expectations weren‚Äôt fully met. In my experience, support was responsive, and the app has improved a lot since then; it‚Äôs now smoother to navigate, more beginner-friendly, and clearly shaped by user feedback.



Monetization & Value:  
MakesYouFluent operates on a subscription model, offering various plans to suit different needs. The All Language Pass is probably the best value if you‚Äôre interested in learning multiple languages. The app is ad-free, which for a paid app is a given but sadly not an assured thing with how things are going, and the clean, modern UI makes for a distraction-free learning experience.

That said, the biggest issue I had was the lack of a free trial. It feels a bit odd that there‚Äôs no way to test out the app, even for a week, before committing to a subscription. It would be helpful to get a feel for the features and interface before deciding whether it‚Äôs worth paying for.



Final Thoughts:  
If you already have some basics in a language and want to get better at speaking, MakesYouFluent is definitely worth a look. It‚Äôs a good option for practicing real conversations and building confidence without the usual classroom feel.

That said, there‚Äôs still room for improvement. More grammar exercises could help balance out the focus on speaking and listening. The app‚Äôs UI has improved a lot, but there‚Äôs always space for a bit more polish and the occasional bug fix.

Overall, MakesYouFluent has been a really useful tool in my language-learning journey. Its approach is engaging, and the focus on practical skills makes it stand out among other language apps. If you‚Äôre looking for more speaking practice, it‚Äôs worth giving it a try.

It kinda smells like Lorenzo Pazzaglia's Van Py Rhum.

I have reviewed most of my collection here before, besides the gentleman and eau de soleil blanc so here goes:

Givenchy Gentleman Reserve Priv√©e: It smells of Coffee, vanilla and booze which is a beautiful combination of scents. It lasts okayish in summers though it is a winter perfume so I should reserve my judgement for now. Projection just after application is really good, 5-6 feet I would say. But, that number drops down quickly as the day goes on. Definitely not a skin perfume, lasts better on clothes and you can smell the fragile alcohol note more as well.

Eau De Soleil Blanc: It's a good summer perfume, it sort of smells like those amazing south indian coconut curries. The coconut note is toward the sweet side, almost almond-y. It is a bit weak with a 2-3 feet projection and lasts maybe 4-5 hours on a good day. It isn't made for the Indian Climate, feels too warm for here but I think it would do better somewhere pleasant.

When I (30F) was in HS, I had a few teachers I was kinda close with, but this one (\~50M) in particular. After I graduated, we said goodbye (and both said we'd miss each other) but indirectly kept in touch. We saw each other maybe 2-3 times a year, never truly on purpose, but when we bumped into each other we'd always take the time to talk a bit and get news from each other's life, telling how glad we were to see each other again, and so on. We also followed each other on some social media. 

In the past five years or so, since covid I'd say, we completely lost touch. We've been a few years without seeing each other, but then suddently we started meeting again randomly and we'd always talk a bit. I also admitted to him recently that I'm kinda nervous around him because he's had a huge impact on my life. Since then, he's been a little bit more affectionate around me (we'd call each other by our first name, exchange a few messages on our phones), but none of us really made a move to change anything. Sometimes I'd wonder if I could ask him to grab a coffee sometime, but I was too scared he would refuse, since he never hinted that he'd want to spend more time with me and he always seems busy.

Now the last time we bumped into each other, it was at a public event. We couldn't really talk to each other because we were both with other people, but before I left, I took the time to get to him and say hi. We talked a bit and, as I said I'd go, he told me ""it'd be great if we find the time to go for a meal together sometime"". I was surprised he'd say so, but I was glad he did. I said sure and then he told me ""just let me know when you can"", in the sense ""you can reach out to me whenever"" but without tying to schedule a time right away, which kinda seemed weird to me. I mean, if he really wanted to meet, we'd set up a time and date without waiting, right ?

So my question is : does he really want me to reach to him and schedule for a lunch in the near future ? Or was he just being polite ? Is it weird if I write to him maybe next week to tell him I'm free if he still wants to go and eat someplace together ?",3,1757696489.0,AskHSteacher,2,1.0,False

TL:DR:

* If you have general admission tickets, go to Biassono-Lesmo station and use that entrance to the track.¬†
* Bring suncream and things to block the sun. Drink plenty of water and make sure to eat something.¬†
* Bring a folding chair or cushion.¬†
* Go as early as possible to avoid crowds and minimise queuing. If you have mobility issues, I recommend staying in the centre of Milan and getting on the train there as you are more likely to get a seat.¬†
* I did the Sunday alone as a woman, and I felt perfectly safe and I had great chats with other people during the day.¬†

Tickets

* We purchased general admission tickets for ‚Ç¨120 each. We bought from the official website ([MonzaGPF1.ticketone.it](http://monzagpf1.ticketone.it)) soon after they were released in early September 2024.

Travel

* Flights to Malpensa Airport. It takes approximately 1 hour to get to the centre of Milan by train or taxi (‚Ç¨100-120).
* Public transport: can pay by tap card or phone going through the barriers, but regional trains require a prepurchased ticket. Buy online or at the station.¬†
* Trains to the circuit: Trenord offers special tickets from any Lombardy station to Biassono Lesmo Station (‚Ç¨5 per day), or any Lombardy station to Monza station including the Black Shuttle Bus from Monza station to the track (‚Ç¨10 per day). These tickets cost more than single train tickets, but less than getting daily flexible tickets. Tickets are checked at the stations.¬†
* For Friday and Saturday, it was straight forward to find train timetables online using the Trenord website or Google maps. Friday was complicated by train strikes but there are multiple lines that go to Monza. I have to say that when I was confused and I asked locals or officials, they were incredibly kind and helpful. Shoutout to the pharmacy student who led a gaggle of F1 fans to the correct platform!
* On Sunday, there were special trains that ran direct from Milano Porta Garibaldi to Biassono Lesmo (no stops in between). I couldn‚Äôt find information for these online, but an official at the Biassono Lesmo station had a printout I could take a photo of. The earliest train was at 7:20am, and the latest going back to Garibaldi were at 7:35pm. There were also direct trains between Milano Centrale and Monza, earliest at 8:50 and latest going back at 19:58. If there were other trains outside this I couldn‚Äôt find them.¬†

Day by Day - travel to the circuit and where we sat

* Friday
   * On Friday, we got the train to Monza and got a shuttle. We got a train at 9:30 and were standing for the whole trip. We waited around a half hour for a shuttle, which took 40 minutes to get to the track. The shuttle brought us to the road to entrance G. Tickets for the shuttle are checked and you are given a wristband.¬†
   * Entrance G had a significant queue which we did not join. Instead, we walked further to entrance A/B which had a far shorter queue for bag check and security. It was crowded going within the circuit. We sought out general admission space at Curva Biassono and Curva del Serraglio but they were busy, and ended up at Curve di Lesmo. We couldn‚Äôt see a screen but we got a seat on the general admission stands and could see the cars well enough.¬†
   * It took us 4 hours to get from our AirBnB to Curve di Lesmo, we had anticipated it would take 2 hours. On a non-grand prix day, it would take approximately 1 hour. This was partly due to us taking wrong turns around the track but largely due to the crowds going into the track. We ultimately walked 17km that day, and I got an unholy blister on the sole of my foot.¬†
   * Going back to our accommodation, we got the train from Biassono-Lesmo station. It took us 15 minutes to get out of the track and were on a train quickly, and got a seat for the 30 minute train ride back.¬†
* Saturday
   * We got a train at 8:30am, again we stood the whole way and it was intensely crowded. I found the heat and being cramped against others overwhelming. When I thought no more people could fit on the train, more people squished on. This was worsened by people refusing to move into the aisle of the train between seats, but I realised later the lack of handholds makes this difficult.¬†
   * We were able to get into the track in 20 minutes, and got a seat with a view of a screen at Curva del Serraglio. It got busy around qualifying but was very enjoyable.¬†
   * We left in the last 5 minutes of qualifying to get to the station quickly, we were there in 15 minutes and got a seat on the train back.¬†
* Sunday
   * I was alone on this day as my friend was sick and unable to go. I was a bit concerned about being a woman going on my own, but I had met other women going on their own and I found while the track was busy I never felt unsafe.¬†
   * I took a metro to Garibaldi station and arrived at 6:45am. The platform for the train to Lesmo wasn‚Äôt displayed initially but was announced over the intercom. There was a large queue stretching around the front of the station but I found it was well organised. They let limited groups onto the platform at a time which prevented crushing. I got a seat on the second train at 7:50am, and got to the track and found a seat at Curve di Lesmo around 9:30am. I cannot emphasise enough how much of a better option it is to go to Biassono-Lesmo Station and sit in the general admission areas around there.¬†
   * I left during the last lap to get ahead of the queues. The race results were very much decided at that point and because I was alone I wanted to get back as quick as possible. I queued outside the station and got a train around 5pm, and was back at Garibaldi in 30 minutes.¬†

What I brought

* I brought a standard sized backpack with the following: folding chair, lunch box, earplugs, battery pack, satin scarf, handheld electric fan, umbrella, cap, blister plasters, wet wipes, tissues, suncream, deodorant and hand sanitizer.¬†
* My folding chair is from Decathlon, costs ‚Ç¨40 and folds small enough to fit in a backpack. The general admission stands are metal so they get hot, dirty, and uncomfortable quickly. Most people had folding chairs.
* I used an insulated lunchbox with ice packs and a frozen water bottle to bring snacks and a sandwich - this kept food cold and I didn‚Äôt have to queue for food. The frozen water bottle steadily melted and gave me ice cold water.¬†
* My satin scarf was great to keep the sun off the back of my neck. I wore it under my cap. The handheld fan was helpful too. When you finish your food you can position your fan by an ice pack to blow cool air on your face.¬†
* Battery packs are technically not allowed. I hid mine in my backpack in a pouch with other items. I believe they‚Äôre banned due to fire risk but it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect people attending all day events like a Grand Prix to not need a battery pack. I brought one that can charge my phone 3 times.¬†
* The umbrella I used is from Decathlon. It‚Äôs a sturdy white one with SPF 50 within the fabric which reflected the sun, kept me cool and stopped me getting sunburnt. I brought a flag too and used that to cover my legs for further protection from the sun.¬†
* I reapplied suncream several times, however, I got dust on my arms and legs so I used the wipes to freshen up before reapplying. They were handy to clean my hands after eating too!
* Tissues were essential for the porta potties. They were disgusting and I had clean where I would sit every time, and often toilet paper ran out.¬†
* Please bring deodorant. So many people smelled so bad. You can‚Äôt bring aerosols but a roll on is better than nothing. Please bring and reapply deodorant.¬†
* I wished I brought bug repellent, I got about 5 mosquito bites.¬†
* Blister plasters are self explanatory.¬†
* For people bringing nice cameras with detachable lenses, it is hit or miss whether you are allowed. I saw a man turned away at security because he had one, but I also saw people who got them in. I am not a fan of them because they are large and block your view, and sometimes people who use them get cranky if you‚Äôre in the way of their shot.¬†
* Bottles over 500ml were not allowed, likewise for alcohol and drinks in cans or glass bottles. How thorough security was in checking bags really varied so I did see a lot of people with prohibited items.¬†

Amenities at the Track

* Compared to the Barcelona Grand Prix I attended in 2024, some things were better at Monza than others
* Water refill stations: absolutely not enough, when it comes to walking 2km each way to refill your water bottle or buying a bottle of water for ‚Ç¨1.50, I opted to buy a bottle of water.¬†
* Food and Drinks: These were far more abundant than in Barcelona. There were many stands and I never queued longer than 15 minutes. They had a great mix of options from sandwiches to burgers, to coffee, soft drinks, water and energy drinks, and some dessert/smoothie stands. You could also buy pints of Heineken. They are definitely overpriced but not completely ridiculous prices (around 6 euro). I didn‚Äôt buy any food because I brought my own, but the food I saw other people eating looked very good.¬†
* Toilets: I never had to queue for the toilet, but they were porta potties. They were disgusting and so warm inside. There was water to rinse your hands but no soap so hand sanitiser is the next best thing.¬†
* Merchandise: There were a lot of stands outside the circuit selling merchandise, most of it left over from previous years for discount prices. You could buy merch in the circuit as well. I didn‚Äôt explore these because I have enough merch already and they were expensive. I have to mention that I saw a very sweaty man with a visible patch of ringworm on his back trying on shirts, so buy with caution and wash before wearing.¬†
* Shade: In Barcelona, they had large fans and water misters around the track, but I found in Monza there are lots of shady spots among the trees.
* Phone Signal: In Barcelona I had barely any signal the whole time, but in Monza I had 5G the whole time, even on Sunday. This made me feel a lot better because I could stay in touch with people while I was on my own, and follow the race on my phone.¬†

Other tips for Milan

* One of my mosquito bites got infected and I needed antibiotics. I used Doctorsa to book an appointment, do a video call with a doctor who emailed me a prescription that I got filled at a 24 hour pharmacy. The call cost ‚Ç¨30 and the antibiotics cost ‚Ç¨6.54. I did this at 6am on a Tuesday and was able to collect my prescription at 7:30am the same day.¬†
* My friend and I booked QC Termemilano for the Monday after the grand prix weekend. I had done a lot of walking and standing and sitting in the heat and on packed trains, so it was incredible to relax in the saunas and jacuzzis and have a sit down meal in a restaurant. It helped me recover after a very intense weekend. It costs 60 euro for 5 hour entry, and an extra 30 for lunch.¬†

Conclusion

* The race atmosphere was great. There were loads of dedicated fans of all ages and nationalities. I had some great conversation with people and rarely found them to be inconsiderate. People working at the track were very kind and helpful.
* I would not do the Friday as well - by the time I got home on Sunday I was exhausted mentally. The Friday was good to scope out a good spot, but I think if I had listened to the advice on Reddit initially I wouldn‚Äôt have had to do Friday.¬†
* I would go as early as possible to the track to beat the crowds and get a good viewing spot.¬†
* I would go to this race again. I read the horror stories about 2022, but I think everything was as organised as it could be considering the logistics, and I never felt unsafe despite the huge number of people. While people were drinking, no one I saw was drunk.¬†
* I really enjoyed seeing the historic cars and the Porsche race! I don‚Äôt follow the Porsche Supercup but fast cars on a track are always fun for me.¬†

Look I know this is a dating place, but honestly also looking for a friend, if things happens they happen, if not, that's ok.

Hi and Hola, Darla or Wolf 29 over here, this applies to both NA and SA since I speak fluently both languages.

So please follow the rule of the night-time, I got a lot of people that really does not read that part specifically and reach out while our time does not match or people that say they do, but for some reason does not have the time in the end (supposedly, yeah bunch of liars) same reason I didn't answer some request at all. Also this does not mean I can't be on other times as well, but the more consistent is late nights.

To the point
I play a lot of games, gaming since 2002, but if we are talking about consistency at the moment:
Nightreing (getting ready for the ranked mode deep of night).
Gunfire reborn, really want anyone to play, it's not amazing, but it's fun.
Deadlock, my god i got hooked by it and even more by Bebop, Lash was right.
We can do 7 Days to die, No man sky (just got back into it), Valheim, V Rising ( started it for a few hours but want to play it coop honestly), if you want a competitive one then more so Rivals, left OW a while now, grounded 1 and 2, palworld, lord of the fallen and honestly more, even into friend-slops or whatever you want to call it, i also am a big fan of actuall horror game and survival horror is by far my favorite genre aside from dark fantasy, open to a lot of games and a lot of indies that you may want to try (lost castle 1/2, across the obelisk, whisper mountain outbreak, blightbound, more)
Would be fun to find someone sharing same of the passion i do for this thing, as a culture, I'm more so of a nerd in the terms of gaming and the culture behind it.

About me:
Introvert, Combined ADHD, BPD type 2, I can handle a extrovert if they can handle my switch from high to low energy, I like to be silly and serious at the same time and also like deep conversations when it happens or just silence when we just enjoy the time gaming and helping each other, im possibly on the spectrum wich would make a lot of sense, needs confirmation, you can be acting extremely goofy or as you like, we enjoy it, no discrimination, anyone is welcome.
I like Hard Rock, metal, Indies, mostly gaming OSTs, orchestra, some pop, some ambient and open to a lot you want to share too.
I would like to start going again to cons and try cosplay for the first time next year.
I'm an odd person honestly, can't help it, but hey, honesty.
Huge coffee enjoyer and starter connoisseur.
I enjoy games showcases and can't wait to see the bloodbath in this game awards at december.
I want to get back into anime, shows and much more, stopped a lot since the thing above took control over a lot of stuff, if you want to share anything or make me watch something Im down.
Late night is my preference because I enjoy it, don't want to do it all the time of course, but as of now it has become almost full time since job got in the way, even if it changes back i still would do late night sessions, but not the entire week lol.
Please only reach out if you follow those terms, Late Night, full fledged gamer, I want to know someone that religiously follow games as I do, like a culture thingy.
Ask anything or whatever, happy hunting and thanks for reading.
(Also no groups, already have 2, one is a small with good friends, but I'm trying to get to know someone outside of it that would share almost the same stuff as I do.",0,1757696288.0,NerdDating,0,0.5,False

1nf8frv,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1nf8frv/talk_me_off_a_ledge/,Talk me off a ledge.,"Partner didn‚Äôt change a dirty diaper. 

After a long night of waking up with my 4mo every hour, my partner grabbed the baby out of the nursery (where I sleep for now).  Initially I was grateful for an extra 30mins to rest before he needed to get ready for work.  I surface about 20 minutes later with coffee feeling like a zombie and recounting what a brutal night I had with little dude.  This mf has the audacity to let me know that he thinks the baby pooped and he doesn‚Äôt think he can change him.  Apparently,  it was too nauseating and smelled like ‚Äòcheez-it‚Äô crackers.  I asked if he was kidding,  he wasn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm a SAHM for now so I‚Äôm the primary caregiver and it makes sense that I change more diapers,  but I‚Äôm now realizing I haven‚Äôt seen my SO change a single diaper in a long time.  

I‚Äôve gone through pregnancy, pre-e,  traumatic birth,   Multiple tears and persistent loss of feeling in my vagina,  struggling to feel at home in my new body,  breast feeding, and waking up with LO every single time to give US a family and he can‚Äôt stomach changing a diaper?!

I did talk to him about it and he said that, ‚ÄúI was right and that wasn‚Äôt fair to me.‚Äù 

He‚Äôs not a monster,  he used to stay up with the baby so that I could get sleep.  We quit doing that when we thought sleep had improved enough for me to get less fragmented sleep.  Then the 4 month regression hit really hard and I feel like we‚Äôre back to newborn days.  

I got the ick so hard after this interaction.  I want to yell at SO but I just feel like I‚Äôll be beating a dead horse and it‚Äôs not really productive after he‚Äôs already apologized.

1nf8fql,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nf8fql/my_partner_27f_and_i_26m_have_different_values/,My partner (27F) and I [26M] have different values and sucky communication. I need some advice,"

There are some fundamental mindset and value differences that my partner and I have, and I would like to reconcile them and compromise, but I feel like the default is just to tell me I'm wrong, and need to do things better/more, or whatever.

I'll start with sexual compatibility, because I think that's been one of the areas with the most tension, negatively affecting us the most. Its pretty important to me, that's how I feel wanted and loved, I'm very giving, I'm down at any point, even if I gotta eat it on soft, or do it real slow so we don't wake up too much because it's late. If I had to put a number to it, I think 1-3 times a week would be fine, right now it's about once every month and a half, has been for almost all of the year and a half we been together. She dosnt need it at all, dosnt care, dosnt care to try to get more in the mood if we aren't immediately already (and I don't think she gets spontaneous desire, so I don't really know how to start things) I know if I got a lil headstart like a lil 20 seconds I could get her more in the mood, (she finishes multiple times every time without fail, and ejaculates so I know (and taste) that it's real. 
I like to massage her and touch her slow for a long time first but she goes to sleep very easy lol so she'll always knock out. She's called me gross for focusing on sex, "" all you care about is sex"" "" you just want to get your dick wet"" ' your only problem is sex"" and a lot of other phrasings, I would like more affection in general but yes, sex is the biggest part of it and the one thing I can't get from anyone else. Id also like more affection in general, I have to ask to be held and maybe it's my imagination but In my head I hear the feeling of a long drawn out sigh and a thought "" guess I gotta do this""

    I'll be honest, even though I have and still do genuinely try to not let it affect me, it has bubbled some resentment sometimes for not just how hard it is to try to get it met but for being told I'm gross or a dirt bag for caring about that. It really hurt that we just couldn't see it any other way. And, over time, it does make a person less eager to go out of your way for them. And it makes me feel like I need to disconnect myself from her over time so it doesn't hurt so much when she says that kind of thing to me. 

I have my faults, I am most definitely not perfect. I've played my role in worsening the dynamics at play, I've said some things I regret sometimes, I've done some things I regret, I haven't cheated at all, I did have wandering eyes on social media in the beginning. I am very sorry for this and I regret it a lot, I know it made things worse and harder, made her more likely to get more upset with me in the future and get triggered, and say nasty things.

Next, finances.

She makes a little more than me, like a dollar or so now, since I've been working on getting more raises. I like my job, for many different reasons. The schedule is perfect, 3 12s then a 6 hour shift m-T, gives me a day and a half to do my own thing at the house, and specifically if I can get more back into it, this lets me record music vocals at my PC in the living room, if I worked any other shift I wouldn't really get that chance. I'm bipolar, and I have burnt myself at jobs before. I've never had a single job more than 2 years, and I'm looking to change that from my resume by sticking it out for a bit.My work commute is also 5 minutes so I save on gas. My coworkers respect, appreciate and stick up for me. I could stand to make more money, but I'm making raises happen. Just signed another paper for a raise yesterday, no one else in the dept I work at got one, just me.
But anytime she sends me a job, if I don't apply for it she's upset with me, and I would even say a high likelihood of some form of a ""we need to have a talk. You need to make more money, you need to want to, now"" I never asked her to send me jobs, Im happy with mine and it's part of my larger plan for now. There's one she sent that was a big pay upgrade compared to the others, but it's a swing roster and swing shift, and me having insomnia, not being able to sleep in the day, and bipolar, I know lack of sleep and lack of a solid routine is bad for me, plus id have to lose being on the same schedule as her, my mental health and time with her is much more priceless than the couple bucks an hour I might be missing. Every paycheck I have several savings going out automatically, to an account I don't have a card for, another saving I also use for food, and a recurring deposit into acorns. I'm saving up my 6 months of emergency funds now. I'm going slow and steady, but I'm doing a great job of setting myself up. 
   But she's basically telling me I'm a loser for not switching jobs immediately. Even though she herself went from 50k last year(with bonuses) to 37k this year, but she tells me "" im so much happier at this job, it really was that other one making me depressed"" so obviously she realizes there's a tradeoff of how much money you make vs liking your job, a lot of those really high paying ones are like that because no one is wants to do it. So it feels a little annoying that she recognizes "" I feel so much better and happier here even though I'm not making as much money"" but then when it comes to me I feel like I'm expected to do the opposite. And if I don't I'm made to feel like a loser who isn't going anywhere ever.

I've been paying for more and more stuff, and I would even say that I pay 60+% of the total expenses lately, but she still feels like I don't do enough or I don't want to do it. There is a reason she might feel this way. For one ofc I'm trying to help us save money and only get what we need, and it's also bc recently when she needed money again I said like "" try to remember this though and stop telling me I dont do things for you"" I know this isn't very tact, but I just wanted to try to implant the memory bc I tend to hear I ""never"" want to help or take us out. Anyways the specific thing is, she's been needing help with a few hundred $ every couple months, more so lately, and this time it was bc of the job switch and her paychecks being spread out. She had to buy work clothes bc the new job dresses up when the old didn't, she bought a pair of work shoes, then bought a couple more, and in my head I'm thinking, the logical thing here would be to wear the one pair of shoes for the month you're low on funds and then get some more, she put it on credit card, and that's a judgement call. she does need work clothes, not a big deal, and when she was asking me for money again I was always going to give it but I was trying to kinda say like "" of course I'm going to help you, but let's try to not keep putting ourselves in that position"" I didn't mean to be demeaning or for anything to escalate, was supposed to just be a "" yeah of course, we keep running into this though let's just try to be careful"" she hates that, "" why do you always make me feel like shit when I ask for help"" and such. 

I feel like I keep getting better and doing more, although maybe not doing more as perfectly as I could be, but it feels like it's not enough unless it's exactly what she wants me to do in the way she wants me to do it, or its for nothing We're also struggling with $ due to several financial decisions that I opposed, but we went with what she wanted anyway, and it made things harder for us each time. So it did also frustrate me that I'm having to keep paying for financial decisions I didn't think was the right call in the first place (apartment when we both had houses we could've been living at, she bought a brand new car, didn't have adaptive cruise control, traded it in for another brand new one.) 


She dislikes that I smoke weed daily. I will say, yes, I smoke often, I wouldn't say that I smoke a lot. On week days, I usually smoke half a bowl when I get home and finish it before bed, vaping delta 8 in between. I look forward to it after work, helps me relax and sleep, and I have overdone it before, so I KNOW what over doing it looks like.

 based on Last time I picked up bud, I'm set to have spent 60$ a month on it. To smokers weed is normal it's just a regular part of life. Morning coffee = after work bowl. To me at least. Might even go so far to say the coffee is worse for you.  Anyways she's not totally against it but dosnt like that I do it daily, no matter the amount. 


I feel like she has this ideal version of me in her head that meets her every whim with no hesitation and if I'm not that, I'm a problem. She tells me what a man needs to be and do, but I feel like I do most things in general. She does drive us places though(and often says she gets car sick if not the one driving) but housework or getting things, w.e pumping gas, most random stuff tends to default to me.

 I asked her what a woman's role was (i do not believe in gender roles in that way, I don't think anyone has to do a role in particular , whatever works for the couple, but I asked because she kept saying it in our conversation so i genuinely thought ""okay, let's break down what masculine and feminine roles are and we can divvy them up and know what each should be looking to do"" I never really got an answer here, she said something about "" well when you make enough money I'll stay here and make the house spotless"" I never said anything about cleaning, and I didn't have something in particular in mind, I just wanted more clarification on what each one of us should be doing in her eyes, I didn't ask facetiously.

 I was expecting an answer like being nourishing or something like that, idk.  She says me not wanting to help her is now why she won't want to be with me sexually because me not doing things she tells me are important to her makes her want to do less for me, but also that's kinda where it started out for me too. I had stuff I was asking for (more respect in general, but intimacy is what I mean here) that I wasnt getting, was being made to feel nasty for wanting her or it affecting me over time. And it made me less likely to want to go out of my way when it dosnt feel appreciated or that what I need matters. I am by no means saying that only she needs to get better about it,  we both need to get better about it, but I feel like it's all being pushed onto me. I've had my down moments, maybe even a good bit of them, but I think I did pretty good most days to try  to put aside how I'm really feeling and throw on a smile and massage her legs, get her food or whatever else. Idk. I'm tired. I wish I felt like my side was more understood, or that she realizes she has stuff to work on too, and what she's willing to to for me (or willing to say to me in a negative way) will affect how much out of my way I'm willing to go for her in the exact same way. It feels like my love, respect, and intimacy, is all conditional on the assumption I just kinda go with what she thinks is best. 

What do you guys think? What can we both do better, how do we compromise and feel listened to? 



Tldr: we differ in opinions on money, how important it is vs happiness, the meaning of life. And sexual compatibility. 

I'm made to feel like I'm gross for having sexual needs and for the lack of initiation or reciprocity affecting me. We talk past each other, don't feel like we're getting what the other person means. I feel like all the problems are pushed onto me to solve, and I'm being told I do the bare minimum, when I do the majority of the payments right now, I've always done a high majority of the house work, affection, intimate and not. I'm being told that I won't amount to anything because I didn't take a swing shift job she sent me (that did pay a lot more) when I've told her I'm not looking for a new job right now. 

She tells me I don't want to help her with money because after a couple times she needed help with finances (while putting stuff on credit card, work stuff, judgement call) this last time I said like "" I'll help you, but let's try to stop putting ourselves in this position (spending what we don't need to when we don't have it)

-Asks if she can be picked up from school literally every singe day. There is a free bus that brings her right home, and no one is usually available at pickup time.
-Always rips off her (faux) lashes/nails and sticks them anywhere and everywhere. Will leave them on peoples chairs, beds, tables, etc. with no regard. Honestly a pattern as she typically just leaves her trash behind anywhere, in the car, living room, etc. 
-If you go into a store with her she will pickup items to bring to checkout without asking or even checking the price. 
-Will LOUDLY watch her titkoks in any environment.
-Always glued to her phone but somehow it is always dying or dead when she leaves the house.

With all that being said she did get her first job this year at a fast food chain, however she [primarily uses it as an excuse to leave school 30mins early every day despite the fact she only works once a week. She does summer school every year as she routinely fails at least 2-3 classes. She is definitely more interested in friends than school. 

I in no way want to SHAME her for acting like a teen, but I would like to have her gain some more social awareness as she is close to graduating school. 

Any advice, gentle parenting, WHATEVER would be appreciated for real! I don't want her to feel like she is ""in trouble"" I just want to get through the message in a way that resonates and helps shape her to be the cool adult I know she will be.",0,1757695957.0,AskParents,4,0.5,False
1nf8f6l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nf8f6l,Salmon Paella from Chile? Yep.,"Hi folks!

2020 Chilean ration today from DAFF! Menu 6, Salmon Paella. Best by 03/30/2023, so a bit past the date, but did it matter?

Shout out to Tracy Phillips for this experience!

Connoisseurs of Paella, consider this your warning.....avert your eyes!

Pics 1-3 show packaging and contents. Keep in mind this is a civilian ration from a Military supplier. Love those green sporks!

Coffee not prepared. The last Chilean coffee gave me weird vibes and the flavor wasn't ideal. This coffee seemed to have oxidized or taken in moisture same as last time as it was large clumps and didn't look spray or freeze-dried.  I just opted not to have it.

Pics 4-5 show the apricots in syrup and one of the biscuits I had for breakfast this morning with my protein shake! A fresh review I'd say! I like to crumble the biscuits up into the apricots to cut the sweetness a bit. These definitely looked oxidized and it was detectable but not nearly off-putting enough to not thoroughly enjoy these!

Pic 6 is the pineapple drink,  fully sugared and clumped together! Based on what I learned from the last time I made this, I literally used 1/2 the amount of water it called for (500mL instead of 1L), and wholly cow was that the way to go! Sweet, sour/tart and very pineapplely! Far better than last time!

Pic 7 is the berries in jam. I would love to try these fresh just to see how much the flavor changed. I ate, or sort of drank I guess, 100% of this and found no issue with it. Sort of has an artificial sweetener taste though. I didn't look at the ingredients. 

Pic 8 shows the Salmon Paella.  Pretty big chunks of salmon with an almost Smokey flavor. The rice texture was exactly as you'd expect, typical retort rice flavor and texture. This wasn't bad and I ate 100% of it, but I would not go out of my way for it again. This was my lunch today along with the berries and 2nd biscuit!

Pic 9 shows the 2nd biscuit in all its glory! I have no reason liking these as much as I do! And I do love them. 160 kcal each though....yikes!

In summary, a great experience to try a dish like this, and I'm thankful I got to try it!

Take care folks!",15,1757695938.0,MRE,2,0.95,False

Took him 3 seconds to note that my pours were too wide - that my outermost spiral pours were touching the V60's edge. I do that because that's how I could get my bed to look nice and flat at the end. The next cup we kept all the variables the same, but he told me to forget about getting a nice bed, and to focus doing spiral pours about the size of a quarter. The resulting cup was spectacular - all the notes opened up, astringency gone, and the aftertaste was sweet and long.

There are some fundamental mindset and value differences that my partner and I have, and I would like to reconcile them and compromise, but I feel like the default is just to tell me I'm wrong, and need to do things better/more, or whatever.

I'll start with sexual compatibility, because I think that's been one of the areas with the most tension, negatively affecting us the most. Its pretty important to me, that's how I feel wanted and loved, I'm very giving, I'm down at any point, even if I gotta eat it on soft, or do it real slow so we don't wake up too much because it's late. If I had to put a number to it, I think 1-3 times a week would be fine, right now it's about once every month and a half, has been for almost all of the year and a half we been together. She dosnt need it at all, dosnt care, dosnt care to try to get more in the mood if we aren't immediately already (and I don't think she gets spontaneous desire, so I don't really know how to start things) I know if I got a lil headstart like a lil 20 seconds I could get her more in the mood, (she finishes multiple times every time without fail, and ejaculates so I know (and taste) that it's real. 
I like to massage her and touch her slow for a long time first but she goes to sleep very easy lol so she'll always knock out. She's called me gross for focusing on sex, "" all you care about is sex"" "" you just want to get your dick wet"" ' your only problem is sex"" and a lot of other phrasings, I would like more affection in general but yes, sex is the biggest part of it and the one thing I can't get from anyone else. Id also like more affection in general, I have to ask to be held and maybe it's my imagination but In my head I hear the feeling of a long drawn out sigh and a thought "" guess I gotta do this""

    I'll be honest, even though I have and still do genuinely try to not let it affect me, it has bubbled some resentment sometimes for not just how hard it is to try to get it met but for being told I'm gross or a dirt bag for caring about that. It really hurt that we just couldn't see it any other way. And, over time, it does make a person less eager to go out of your way for them. And it makes me feel like I need to disconnect myself from her over time so it doesn't hurt so much when she says that kind of thing to me. 

I have my faults, I am most definitely not perfect. I've played my role in worsening the dynamics at play, I've said some things I regret sometimes, I've done some things I regret, I haven't cheated at all, I did have wandering eyes on social media in the beginning. I am very sorry for this and I regret it a lot, I know it made things worse and harder, made her more likely to get more upset with me in the future and get triggered, and say nasty things.

Next, finances.

She makes a little more than me, like a dollar or so now, since I've been working on getting more raises. I like my job, for many different reasons. The schedule is perfect, 3 12s then a 6 hour shift m-T, gives me a day and a half to do my own thing at the house, and specifically if I can get more back into it, this lets me record music vocals at my PC in the living room, if I worked any other shift I wouldn't really get that chance. I'm bipolar, and I have burnt myself at jobs before. I've never had a single job more than 2 years, and I'm looking to change that from my resume by sticking it out for a bit.My work commute is also 5 minutes so I save on gas. My coworkers respect, appreciate and stick up for me. I could stand to make more money, but I'm making raises happen. Just signed another paper for a raise yesterday, no one else in the dept I work at got one, just me.
But anytime she sends me a job, if I don't apply for it she's upset with me, and I would even say a high likelihood of some form of a ""we need to have a talk. You need to make more money, you need to want to, now"" I never asked her to send me jobs, Im happy with mine and it's part of my larger plan for now. There's one she sent that was a big pay upgrade compared to the others, but it's a swing roster and swing shift, and me having insomnia, not being able to sleep in the day, and bipolar, I know lack of sleep and lack of a solid routine is bad for me, plus id have to lose being on the same schedule as her, my mental health and time with her is much more priceless than the couple bucks an hour I might be missing. Every paycheck I have several savings going out automatically, to an account I don't have a card for, another saving I also use for food, and a recurring deposit into acorns. I'm saving up my 6 months of emergency funds now. I'm going slow and steady, but I'm doing a great job of setting myself up. 
   But she's basically telling me I'm a loser for not switching jobs immediately. Even though she herself went from 50k last year(with bonuses) to 37k this year, but she tells me "" im so much happier at this job, it really was that other one making me depressed"" so obviously she realizes there's a tradeoff of how much money you make vs liking your job, a lot of those really high paying ones are like that because no one is wants to do it. So it feels a little annoying that she recognizes "" I feel so much better and happier here even though I'm not making as much money"" but then when it comes to me I feel like I'm expected to do the opposite. And if I don't I'm made to feel like a loser who isn't going anywhere ever.

I've been paying for more and more stuff, and I would even say that I pay 60+% of the total expenses lately, but she still feels like I don't do enough or I don't want to do it. There is a reason she might feel this way. For one ofc I'm trying to help us save money and only get what we need, and it's also bc recently when she needed money again I said like "" try to remember this though and stop telling me I dont do things for you"" I know this isn't very tact, but I just wanted to try to implant the memory bc I tend to hear I ""never"" want to help or take us out. Anyways the specific thing is, she's been needing help with a few hundred $ every couple months, more so lately, and this time it was bc of the job switch and her paychecks being spread out. She had to buy work clothes bc the new job dresses up when the old didn't, she bought a pair of work shoes, then bought a couple more, and in my head I'm thinking, the logical thing here would be to wear the one pair of shoes for the month you're low on funds and then get some more, she put it on credit card, and that's a judgement call. she does need work clothes, not a big deal, and when she was asking me for money again I was always going to give it but I was trying to kinda say like "" of course I'm going to help you, but let's try to not keep putting ourselves in that position"" I didn't mean to be demeaning or for anything to escalate, was supposed to just be a "" yeah of course, we keep running into this though let's just try to be careful"" she hates that, "" why do you always make me feel like shit when I ask for help"" and such. 

I feel like I keep getting better and doing more, although maybe not doing more as perfectly as I could be, but it feels like it's not enough unless it's exactly what she wants me to do in the way she wants me to do it, or its for nothing We're also struggling with $ due to several financial decisions that I opposed, but we went with what she wanted anyway, and it made things harder for us each time. So it did also frustrate me that I'm having to keep paying for financial decisions I didn't think was the right call in the first place (apartment when we both had houses we could've been living at, she bought a brand new car, didn't have adaptive cruise control, traded it in for another brand new one.) 


She dislikes that I smoke weed daily. I will say, yes, I smoke often, I wouldn't say that I smoke a lot. On week days, I usually smoke half a bowl when I get home and finish it before bed, vaping delta 8 in between. I look forward to it after work, helps me relax and sleep, and I have overdone it before, so I KNOW what over doing it looks like.

 based on Last time I picked up bud, I'm set to have spent 60$ a month on it. To smokers weed is normal it's just a regular part of life. Morning coffee = after work bowl. To me at least. Might even go so far to say the coffee is worse for you.  Anyways she's not totally against it but dosnt like that I do it daily, no matter the amount. 


I feel like she has this ideal version of me in her head that meets her every whim with no hesitation and if I'm not that, I'm a problem. She tells me what a man needs to be and do, but I feel like I do most things in general. She does drive us places though(and often says she gets car sick if not the one driving) but housework or getting things, w.e pumping gas, most random stuff tends to default to me.

 I asked her what a woman's role was (i do not believe in gender roles in that way, I don't think anyone has to do a role in particular , whatever works for the couple, but I asked because she kept saying it in our conversation so i genuinely thought ""okay, let's break down what masculine and feminine roles are and we can divvy them up and know what each should be looking to do"" I never really got an answer here, she said something about "" well when you make enough money I'll stay here and make the house spotless"" I never said anything about cleaning, and I didn't have something in particular in mind, I just wanted more clarification on what each one of us should be doing in her eyes, I didn't ask facetiously.

 I was expecting an answer like being nourishing or something like that, idk.  She says me not wanting to help her is now why she won't want to be with me sexually because me not doing things she tells me are important to her makes her want to do less for me, but also that's kinda where it started out for me too. I had stuff I was asking for (more respect in general, but intimacy is what I mean here) that I wasnt getting, was being made to feel nasty for wanting her or it affecting me over time. And it made me less likely to want to go out of my way when it dosnt feel appreciated or that what I need matters. I am by no means saying that only she needs to get better about it,  we both need to get better about it, but I feel like it's all being pushed onto me. I've had my down moments, maybe even a good bit of them, but I think I did pretty good most days to try  to put aside how I'm really feeling and throw on a smile and massage her legs, get her food or whatever else. Idk. I'm tired. I wish I felt like my side was more understood, or that she realizes she has stuff to work on too, and what she's willing to to for me (or willing to say to me in a negative way) will affect how much out of my way I'm willing to go for her in the exact same way. It feels like my love, respect, and intimacy, is all conditional on the assumption I just kinda go with what she thinks is best. 

What do you guys think? What can we both do better, how do we compromise and feel listened to? 



Tldr: we differ in opinions on money, how important it is vs happiness, the meaning of life. And sexual compatibility. 

I'm made to feel like I'm gross for having sexual needs and for the lack of initiation or reciprocity affecting me. We talk past each other, don't feel like we're getting what the other person means. I feel like all the problems are pushed onto me to solve, and I'm being told I do the bare minimum, when I do the majority of the payments right now, I've always done a high majority of the house work, affection, intimate and not. I'm being told that I won't amount to anything because I didn't take a swing shift job she sent me (that did pay a lot more) when I've told her I'm not looking for a new job right now. 

She tells me I don't want to help her with money because after a couple times she needed help with finances (while putting stuff on credit card, work stuff, judgement call) this last time I said like "" I'll help you, but let's try to stop putting ourselves in this position (spending what we don't need to when we don't have it) 

How to do i convey how it's unfair without sounding accusatory. How do we learn to communicate better without feeling so defensive and hurt? I've done this too. Thanks

The Pentair Pentek DGD-5005-20 Big Blue Water Filter immediately stands out for its robust construction and reliable design. Manufactured with 100% pure polypropylene, this sediment filter is both sturdy and effective, ensuring a long lifespan and consistent water filtration. Every time I pick it up, its 1.7-pound weight feels reassuring, and the dimensions (4.5""D x 4.5""W x 20""H) make it compatible with most 20-inch Big Blue filter housings. Its dual-gradient density spun filter is a significant highlight, delivering efficient, multi-layered sediment removal. Whether it's my municipal water or well water system, this filter slides into place effortlessly.

**Effortless Installation and Compatibility**

Setting up this water filter took me less time than expected, even for someone who isn‚Äôt a plumbing expert. The clear dimensions and compatibility details make it a snap to fit into any Big Blue housing. What's more, its universal sizing ensures it remains a top option for many homeowners looking to upgrade their filtration systems. I tested it on both my home‚Äôs system and a system at my coworker's rural property, and in both cases, it adapted seamlessly.

[Check Pentair Pentek DGD-5005-20 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b001vxw0u8/)

**Dual-Gradient Density: Performance at Its Core**

This water filter's dual-gradient density system is a game-changer. Unlike other filters that struggle to handle varying particulate sizes, this unit uses its layered design to efficiently trap both fine and coarse sediments. Over several months of use, I noticed how effectively it reduced silt, sand, and other particulates from my water. Thanks to its pre-filtration feature, it prolongs the life of the final filter, making it cost-effective in the long run. My appliances, especially my coffee maker and washing machine, have thanked me for this.

**Positives**

- Comes with an advanced dual-gradient filtration system for thorough sediment removal.  
- Operates without altering the water's taste, odor, or color.  
- Extremely easy installation due to its compatibility with all 20-inch Big Blue housings.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The filter can clog faster when used with very high sediment levels in rural water supplies.  
- It is slightly pricier than some generic alternatives, though the quality justifies the cost.  

**Durability and Longevity**

Living in a city with fluctuating water quality, I need filters that last, and this one genuinely holds up. Having used cheaper sediment filters in the past, I‚Äôve seen how they barely handle the load. The Pentek model, however, lasts up to six months while maintaining optimal water pressure. Even when processing large amounts of water daily, I observed no noticeable dip in performance.

**Challengers**

While the Pentair Pentek DGD-5005-20 genuinely shines in its performance and durability, it's not without competition. Products like the Whirlpool WHKF-GD25BB and the Culligan R50-BBSA come to mind as competitors in the same category. The Whirlpool filter offers a comparable sediment filtration design but has a lower dirt-holding capacity. The Culligan R50-BBSA, on the other hand, is significantly cheaper, making it an appealing budget option. However, its performance over time doesn‚Äôt quite match the thoroughness and longevity of the Pentek.

**Smart Spending**

In terms of overall value, the Pentek product finds the perfect balance between cost and efficiency. While a cheaper filter might seem tempting upfront, the extended lifespan and higher dirt-holding capacity of this model save money over time. It‚Äôs not the most affordable filter out there, but for those who prioritize clean water and long-term usage, the investment feels justified.

1nf7vpt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nf7vpt,Beginner walker,"I've been following this sub for a while and trying to get up the courage to start to walk..so this is just for anyone who is wanting to start to walk and is nervous, worried, anxious... everything I am and was.

I'm in my 50s obese and I've a bad knee but I have decided to take action. Ive a habit of all or nothing but this time I've decided to pace myself.  

In August I started starting to half way down my road and back again ..  about 300m in total.  I did it once a day and was out of breath. But decided that doing it once a day every day was better than never.  The following week I walked to the end of the road and back ..it was killing me..I was sweating and out of breath. But I stopped took my time.  My main was to get out and walk ... nothing else.  Week three I walked 1km a day and I was proud of myself. 

Its September now and the first week my 1km walk turned into 2 walks a day.  Did this for a few days.   Then I decided to push myself further and walked 1.5km twice a day.  And this week I'm doing 2km walks at least twice maybe three times a day.  I find if I do one big walk a day, it wrecks my bad knee so breaking it down into 2 or 3 walks  is better for me.

As soon as I get out of bed in the morning my shoes are on and I'm ready to walk, before I have my coffee, unless the rain is really bad (Joys of living in Ireland) but once it dries up I'm out.. I have a rain jacket, a hat and an umbrella...and no excuses. I've been caught in the rain but it's always been on the way home and I don't care. I'm listening to podcasts - I will only listen to it when I'm walking so if I want to know what's happening... I've got to walk!  

My steps were around a thousand a day at the start but today after a second long walk I was over 7k by noon. when I started doing anything over 2k was killing me but gradually I'm getting there.  My knee when I was going 2k at the start was sore but today after 7k..it felt ok. (Second time this week I've gone over 7k steps) 

I'm loving getting out early.. I feel like I've accomplish something before the day starts.  I loving seeing nature, all the rainbows, the different clouds and the quiet etc 

I was worried about people seeing me walking, judging me... The opposite has happened. Loads of neighbours have said well done, you're doing great, keep it up. 

My dog is exhausted from all the walking.. she loves it and wants to go with me only for walks now!! 

I haven't lost any weight yet, but I'm beginning eating better now.  Again, I have a habit of all or nothing that I'm trying to break.  So I'm having 3 meals a day now and stopping the snacking.  The weight will start to come off eventually, but right now this is for me and my mental health and overall fitness. ",14,1757694670.0,walking,3,1.0,False

I genuinely thought this of friendship but people tell me otherwise ( and recently I got feelings for my friend which I am not proud of, I intended this as friendship but it didn't stay).

We get along pretty well, yesterday she was complaining about her neck pain. I said to her massage yourself, she said I can't, I said If I can you can also. Then she said then massage me I was massaging her neck which I found odd that she asked me to do it.

I asked her to we go for coffee and she agreed to it. Today we went for coffee and there were three chairs, I sat on the right she sat in the middle and we put stuff in the middle. Then she said she can't hear me (but I was speaking very loudly üíÄ) then moved closer to me by sitting in the middle chair and moving stuff.

I genuinely thought this of friendship but people tell me otherwise ( and recently I got feelings for my friend which I am not proud of, I intended this as friendship but it didn't stay).

We get along pretty well, yesterday she was complaining about her neck pain. I said to her massage yourself, she said I can't, I said If I can you can also. Then she said then massage me I was massaging her neck which I found odd that she asked me to do it.

I asked her to we go for coffee and she agreed to it. Today we went for coffee and there were three chairs, I sat on the right she sat in the middle and we put stuff in the middle. Then she said she can't hear me (but I was speaking very loudly üíÄ) then moved closer to me by sitting in the middle chair and moving stuff.

It may do this almost immediately after starting the machine, as happens in the video attached. Sometimes it takes longer before it shuts off, e.g. in the midst of making coffee (\~20 seconds after start-up).

Machine is only 4yrs old, and regularly cleaned.

I found one source online that says it could be a 'faulty' fuse that keeps tripping, but that seems improbable to me, since the goal of a fuse is to only trip once.

Any leads/experiences on similar random shut downs of Jura coffee machines are appreciated!

My friend rarely asks me to hang out while hanging out very frequently with other people.,"I (17F) am in the last grade of high school. Ive been friends with my bsf (17F) for around three years already. Ive been considering her my best friend for a long time, im not sure if it goes the same for her tho. This problem of mine that i will write about isnt anything new, it has been going on for like two years. 
She has never been really asking me to hang out but during the second and third grade of highschool we had our weekly coffees so i guess thats why. Right now even tho our schedule would easily let us go for a quick coffee she doesnt want to. Ive been trying to hang out with her during the whole summer break and since the schoolyear started but she always had something to do or was tired and wanted to go home. Thats fine but the thing is that ive seen her hanging out with other people a multiple times now. I obviously dont have a problem with that but its a bit weird. 
Another thing is, during the breaks or even after school i can clearly see that she prefers speaking with our friend (17M). She laughs a lot more with him and im always left out of the conversation when we are sitting together. Its making me feel quite upset.
Ive talked to her about these things some time ago and she assured me that im one of her better friends etc etc. Im a person who overthinks a lot tho and i just keep worrying when she acts like that. 
Right now im deep into worrying about it and i just keep thinking about it.

1nf7l5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nf7l5p/selling_your_soul_to_the_devil_is_not_as/,Selling your soul to the Devil is not as straightforward as you think,"I never believed in the Devil until I met him at a coffee shop on a random Tuesday.

It wasn't some dramatic crossroads encounter or a midnight summoning with candles and incantations. He was just sitting there at a corner table in Grind Coffee, wearing a perfectly ordinary navy suit that looked like it was about to burst because of his muscles and reading the Financial Times. The only thing that gave him away was how he knew my name when I'd never seen him before in my life.

""Marcus Chen,"" he said, looking up from his paper as I walked past his table. ""Rough couple of months, haven't they been?"" he grinned.

I stopped dead. ""Do I know you?"" I asked, though something in my gut already knew the answer would complicate everything.

He smiled, and his teeth were perfectly white. Too white. ""Please, sit. I have a proposition that might interest you."" he charmingly gestured in front of him.

I should have walked away. Every rational part of my brain screamed at me to keep moving, get my overpriced latte, and pretend this conversation never happened. Instead, I sat down. As if I didn't even have a say in it.

""I'm in the business of solving problems,"" he said, folding his newspaper with precise creases. ""And you, Marcus, have quite a few problems.""

He was not wrong at all. The foreclosure notice was burning a hole in my jacket pocket, and my credit cards had all been maxed out for weeks. Sarah had left me three months ago, taking our daughter Emma with her. My startup had collapsed spectacularly, leaving me with nothing but debt and a profound sense of failure.

""Who are you?"" I asked.

""Names have power,"" he said. ""Let's just say I'm someone who can help. Your house‚Äîyou're about to lose it. Your daughter barely speaks to you. Your ex-wife thinks you're a failure. Your credit is destroyed. Your business partners won't return your calls."" He leaned back in his chair. ""Am I getting warm?""

The accuracy of his assessment hit me like a physical blow. ""How do you..."" I trailed. He chuckled.

""Know all this? I make it my business to know. The question is: how badly do you want to fix it?""

I stared at him. He was probably in his forties, with salt-and-pepper hair, kind eyes and arms at the size of my head. He looked like someone's accountant, not... whatever he was.

""What are you suggesting?""

""A transaction. A very reasonable one, actually. You have something I want, and I have something you need."" He reached into his jacket and pulled out a leather portfolio. ""I'm prepared to offer you one million dollars. Cash. Untraceable. Enough to save your house, win back your family, start over."" he said. I couldn't resist the urge to sigh at his annoying corporate tone.

""In exchange for what?""

His smile widened. ""Just a small piece of your soul. Nothing dramatic... maybe ten percent. You'll hardly notice it's gone.""

I laughed. I actually laughed out loud. ""You're insane.""

""Am I?"" He opened the portfolio and showed me photographs. Pictures of my house, my daughter's school, Sarah's apartment. ""Marcus, in three days, the bank will repossess your home. In two weeks, your daughter will start at a new school because Sarah can't afford the private one anymore. In a month, you'll be sleeping in your car."" He closed the portfolio. ""I'm offering you a way out.""

""You're talking about selling my soul to the Devil.""

He smiled softly. ""I'm talking about a limited partnership arrangement. Think of it as... spiritual equity financing. You retain majority ownership of your soul, ninety percent. I get a small stake in exchange for solving your... immediate liquidity crisis.""

The business terminology made it sound almost reasonable. Almost.

""This is crazy,"" I said, but I didn't get up.

""Crazy would be letting your pride destroy your family. Crazy would be sleeping in your car while your daughter thinks her father is a loser who couldn't provide for her."" He leaned forward. ""Marcus, I'm not asking for your firstborn or eternal damnation. Ten percent. That's all!""

Letting aside the fact that I was talking to the devil right now, I thought about Emma. About the look in her eyes the last time I'd seen her, when I couldn't afford to take her to the movies. About Sarah's voice when she'd called me pathetic.

""What exactly would happen to that ten percent?""

""Nothing dramatic. You might find yourself slightly more pragmatic in your business dealings. A little less concerned with certain... moral complexities, If you know what I mean..."" he chuckled. ""Small changes. Barely noticeable.""

I sat there for what felt like hours, though it was probably only minutes. Finally, I asked, ""How would this work?""

He reached into his portfolio again and pulled out a contract. It looked like any other legal document‚Äîdense text, whereas clauses, signatures lines. At the bottom, it specified: ""Ten percent (10%) of Party A's immortal soul in exchange for the sum of one million United States dollars ($1,000,000).""

""Just sign here,"" he said, producing an elegant fountain pen seemingly out of nowhere. ""And initial here, acknowledging you understand the terms.""

My hand was shaking as I took the pen. This was insane. This was impossible. But the foreclosure notice in my pocket felt very real, and so did the image of Emma's disappointed face.

I signed.

The moment the pen left the paper, I felt... different. Not dramatically different, but like I'd just had a very strong cup of coffee. More alert. More focused. The man across from me smiled and the contract disappeared into his portfolio.

""Pleasure doing business with you, Marcus."" He stood up and extended his hand. When I shook it, his skin was surprisingly warm. ""The money will be in your account by tomorrow morning.""

""That's it?""

""That's it. Though..."" He paused at the door. ""You might find that other opportunities present themselves soon. When they do, you'll know how to reach me.""

He left, and I sat there staring at my coffee, wondering if I'd just had the most vivid hallucination of my life.

The money was there the next morning. a million dollars, just like he'd promised.

Within six months, everything had changed. I'd saved the house, started a new company, and Sarah was actually taking my calls again. Emma was back in her good school, and I could afford the things that made her smile. The ten percent I'd given up seemed like the bargain of the century.

The changes were subtle, just like he'd said. I found myself cutting corners in ways that would have bothered me before. When a competitor's company was struggling, I bought them out for a fraction of their worth, knowing they were desperate. When a regulatory issue threatened my new business, I made certain donations to certain local politicians that cleared the way. Nothing illegal, exactly, but nothing I would have done before either.

I told myself it was just good business. Pragmatism. The world was harsh, and these were the kinds of decisions successful people made.

...

The second meeting happened at a restaurant downtown. I was celebrating landing a major contract when he slid into the booth across from me, looking exactly the same as he had eight months earlier.

""Congratulations on the Henderson deal,"" he said. ""Quite a coup.""

""Thanks."" I tried to sound casual, but seeing him again made my stomach clench. ""What brings you here?""

""A complication, I'm afraid. You see, that Henderson contract? Your main competitor was about to land it. Had the inside track, actually. Better bid, better relationship with the client.""

I frowned. ""But I won it fair and square.""

""You won it because certain information found its way to certain people, and certain pressure was applied in certain quarters. Information and pressure that, shall we say, originated from my... resources.""

""What are you saying?""

""I'm saying that my ten percent stake in your soul has been working quite hard on your behalf. Harder than we originally contracted for."" He smiled that too-white smile. ""I'm going to need to renegotiate our arrangement.""

""No."" The word came out more forcefully than I'd intended. ""We had a deal.""

""We did. And that deal has been... exceeded. You see, Marcus, your success over the past few months hasn't been entirely your own doing. My investment has been quite active."" He pulled out another contract. ""I'm afraid I'm going to need another fifteen percent.""

""Fifteen percent? That would put you at twenty-five percent total!""

""Still a minority stake,"" he pointed out reasonably. ""And frankly, quite fair given the value I've added to your life."" he grinned. Then he leaned back. ""Of course, if you'd prefer, I could simply... withdraw my support. See how well you do without it.""

The threat was implicit but clear. Everything I'd rebuilt could disappear.

""What happens if I say no?""

""Well, the Henderson contract would fall through, for starters. Seems there might be some irregularities in the bidding process that could come to light. Your financing for the new company might encounter some unexpected obstacles. Sarah might start wondering where all this sudden success came from."" He leaned back. ""I'd hate to see you lose everything again.""

I stared at the contract. Another fifteen percent seemed like a lot, but I'd still retain majority control. And losing everything now would be worse than losing it before, I had so much more to lose.

I signed.

This time, the change was more noticeable. I found myself making decisions that would have horrified the man I'd been two years ago. When a small supplier couldn't deliver on time, I destroyed their business instead of just finding someone else. When an employee threatened to quit, I made sure she was blacklisted throughout the industry. I didn't even look at the eyes of beggars on the streets. These actions felt not just reasonable but necessary, even satisfying. I was changing.

Sarah moved back in with me after a year. Emma called me Daddy again. My business was thriving. In the end, the twenty-five percent of my soul I'd given up seemed like a small price for everything I'd gained.

...

The third meeting was at my office. He didn't make an appointment; I just looked up one day and he was sitting in the chair across from my desk.

""We need to talk,"" he said.

By now, I knew the routine. Some new crisis that required his intervention, some justification for taking another piece of my soul. I was ready for him.

""What's the problem this time?""

""Your wife,"" he said simply.

""Sarah? What about her?""

""She's been asking questions. About your sudden turnaround. About some of your business practices. She's... suspicious.""

""Suspicious of what?""

""She's hired a private investigator, Marcus. A very good one. He's been digging into your finances, your business dealings, your associates. Some of what he's finding is... problematic.""

I felt cold. ""What kind of problematic?""

""The kind that leads to federal investigations. The kind that leads to prison time."" He leaned forward. ""The kind that leads to your daughter visiting you through bulletproof glass."" His smile never seemed wider at that time.

""You're lying.""

""Am I?"" He pulled out a manila folder and slid it across the desk. Inside were photographs, documents, bank records. All the evidence of things I'd done, deals I'd made, corners I'd cut. Individually, they might have been explicable. Together, they painted a picture of systematic corruption.

""This is all circumstantial,"" I said, but my voice was weak.

""Perhaps. But it's enough to raise questions. Enough to start an investigation that would unravel everything. Your business, your marriage, your relationship with Emma. Everything.""

My hands shook. I was feeling fear. Proper fear for the first time in a long time. ""What do you want?"" I shook.

""Thirty percent more,"" he said. ""That would give me fifty-five percent total, a controlling interest. In exchange, all of this evidence disappears. The private investigator has an accident. Sarah's suspicions fade. Your life continues exactly as it is.""

""Fifty-five percent... that's more than half.""

""It is. But consider the alternative.""

I looked at the photographs again. At the evidence of what I'd become. What we'd become, I corrected myself. Because none of this had happened in a vacuum. Every decision had seemed reasonable at the time, necessary even.

""If you have controlling interest, what does that mean for me?""

""Oh don't worry... Nothing will change. I will let you still have your free will. But, you'll naturally find yourself more... aligned with my interests. More efficient in your decision-making. Less burdened by concerns that might interfere with success.""

I thought about Emma. About Sarah. About everything I'd built.

I signed.

The change this time was immediate and profound. It was like someone had adjusted the contrast on my moral vision. Things that had once seemed questionable now seemed obviously correct. Ethical considerations that had once nagged at me simply... weren't there anymore. Good, or bad didn't seem to cross my mind anymore. There were just, success.

I fired a dozen employees without cause because they were expensive. I foreclosed on three small businesses that owed me money, even though I knew it would destroy the families behind them. I manipulated stock prices and destroyed competitors with a systematic ruthlessness that was both alien to who I'd once been and utterly natural to who I was becoming.

Sarah stopped asking questions. The private investigator's report was ""mysteriously"" lost. My business empire grew.

But I was starting to understand that I wasn't driving anymore. I was just along for the ride.

...

The fourth meeting was at Emma's school. I was watching her soccer game when he sat down next to me on the bleachers.

""She's quite talented,"" he said, nodding toward my daughter.

""Don't,"" I said immediately. I grew cold. ""Don't even think about bringing her into this.""

""Relax, Marcus. I'm not here about Emma. I'm here about you."" He pat my back.

""What now?""

""You're dying."" he said with a frown that didn't quite reach his jawline.

The words hit me like a blow. ""What?""

""Pancreatic cancer. Very aggressive. You probably have six months, maybe less."" He said it as casually as he might comment on the weather. ""Of course, medicine has its limitations. But I don't.""

I stared at him, then at Emma running across the field. ""You're lying.""

He grabbed my waist and pulled me closer to him. ""The symptoms will start next week. You'll think it's just stress at first. By the time you see a doctor, it'll be too late for conventional treatment."" He turned to face me. ""But not too late for, unconventional treatment.""

""Let me guess... You want more of my soul.""

""Thirty-five percent more. That would give me ninety percent total. In exchange, the cancer disappears. You live a long, healthy life. You get to watch Emma graduate, get married, have children of her own. I guarantee you.""

""Ninety percent,"" I repeated. ""That leaves me with ten percent.""

""Still enough to maintain your essential self. Your memories, your love for your family, your core personality. You'll just be... more focused. More efficient. Less conflicted.""

""And if I say no?""

""You die. Slowly and painfully. Emma watches her father waste away. Sarah becomes a widow. Your business empire crumbles without your leadership. Everyone that depends on you, comes crumbling down.""

On the field, Emma scored a goal. She looked over at me and waved, her face bright with joy. I waved back, my hand feeling like it weighed a thousand pounds.

""Why?"" I asked. ""Why are you doing this?""

""I'm not doing anything, Marcus. I'm simply offering solutions to your life full of problems. You're the one making the choices.""

""But you're engineering the problems.""

""Am I? I didn't give you cancer, Marcus. I didn't make you eat those donuts. I'm merely offering to cure it. I didn't make your wife suspicious‚Äîyour own actions did that. I offered to fix it. Every step of the way, you've had choices. You've simply chosen the path that led you here.""

He was right, and that was the most horrifying part. Every decision had been mine. Every signature on every contract had been voluntary. I had sold myself piece by piece.

But watching Emma celebrate with her teammates, I knew I couldn't face dying. Couldn't face leaving her.

I signed the contract.

This time, the change was like stepping into a different person's skin. The last vestiges of my old moral framework simply vanished. I felt lighter, more focused, more certain of my purpose. The world became a clearer place, divided neatly between things that served my interests and things that didn't.

I fired my brother from the company the next day because he was questioning my methods. I evicted a dozen families from properties I owned because they were behind on rent. I destroyed a charity that was interfering with one of my developments by exposing its directors' personal secrets. The bonuses decreased, as with every employee's salary.

None of it bothered me. It all felt perfectly reasonable.

Sarah seemed happier too. She stopped asking uncomfortable questions and started enjoying the life my success had provided. Emma thrived in her expensive school, surrounded by luxury I could easily afford.

I was successful, healthy, and wealthy beyond my wildest dreams.

I was also barely human. I was merely a brain, piloting a meat suit.

...

The final meeting was inevitable. I'd been expecting it for months when he appeared in my home office on a quiet Sunday evening. Emma was upstairs doing homework. Sarah was reading in the living room. Everything was perfect.

""Hello, Marcus.""

I didn't respond this time.

""I'm here with good news. You've been such an exemplary partner that I'm prepared to offer you the deal of a lifetime.""

Now I looked up. ""Deal?""

""Total buyout. I purchase your remaining ten percent, and in exchange, I guarantee that Emma and Sarah will want for nothing for the rest of their lives. Emma will get into any college she wants. Sarah will be happy and prosperous. They'll both live long, successful lives.""

""And me?""

""You'll be exactly who you've been becoming. Successful, powerful, effective. You just won't be... you... anymore.""

I leaned back in my chair. It was strange how calm I felt about this moment I'd been dreading. ""What happens to my soul when you own one hundred percent of it?""

""It becomes mine, completely. Your body continues to function, your mind continues to work, but the essential spark that made you Marcus Chen transfers to me. You become, in effect, an extension of my will.""

""I become you.""

""A part of me, yes.""

I thought about the man I'd been three years ago. Desperate, failing, losing everything. That person seemed like a stranger now, someone weak and foolish who'd let silly moral constraints interfere with success. But that person had also been the one who'd loved Emma with pure, uncomplicated joy. Who'd loved Sarah without calculation. Who'd felt genuine remorse when he hurt people.

""What guarantee do I have that you'll keep your word about Emma and Sarah?""

""None. But what choice do you have?""

He was right, of course. He'd been right every step of the way. I could refuse, but then what? I'd still be ninety percent his, still bound to his will in all but the smallest matters. And Emma and Sarah would face whatever future awaited them without his protection.

""If I sign this, will I still remember who I was?""

""Oh yes. Those memories are quite valuable. They help inform decision-making, provide emotional context for manipulating others. You'll remember Marcus Chen very clearly. You just won't be him anymore.""

I picked up the pen. It felt familiar in my hand now, like an old tool I'd grown comfortable using.

""One last question,"" I said. ""What's your name? Your real name?""

For the first time in our relationship, he looked genuinely pleased by something I'd asked.

For some reason, his face looked oddly familiar now.

""You can call me Marcus,"" he said. ""That's who I'm going to be.""

I signed the contract.

The change was instantaneous and total. I felt my sense of self‚Äîthat essential, indefinable thing that had made me drain away like water from a broken cup. What remained was crystal clear purpose, perfect focus, and complete understanding of my role in a larger design.

I am no longer Marcus Chen. I am something that wears Marcus Chen's face and speaks with Marcus Chen's voice and carries Marcus Chen's memories. I run Marcus Chen's business empire and live in Marcus Chen's house and kiss Marcus Chen's wife goodnight.

Emma still calls me Daddy. Sarah still loves the man she thinks I am. They're both happy, prosperous, and protected, just as promised.

And sometimes, late at night when they're both asleep, I remember what it felt like to be the man who loved them. I remember his hopes, his fears, his genuine desire to be good. I remember his weakness, his desperation, and his fatal inability to understand that every deal with me was exactly as straightforward as it seems.

The Devil told me his name, after all.

And now, when desperate people find themselves at coffee shops and restaurants and school bleachers, having conversations with a man in a well-tailored suit who knows their problems and has solutions to offer, they're talking to whatever left of Marcus.

He offers them exactly what I offered him: reasonable terms, logical arguments, and the gradual purchase of their souls in convenient installments.

Just like me, He's always completely honest about the transactions.

Just like me, He never lies about the consequences.

And just like me, He finds that desperate people will sell their souls piece by piece, convincing themselves each time that they're making a reasonable business decision, right up until the moment there's nothing left to sell.

It's exactly as straightforward as it seems.

They just don't want to see it.

All of those are cozy fantasy books by Japanese authors. I was wondering if there's anything out there that's sort of mysterious, in a way that its a little spooky but not like horror, just like another interesting story with supernatural elements like ghosts or yokai?

1nf7hsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nf7hsn/crossing_the_line_from_professionalfriendly/,Crossing the line from professional/friendly relation to something else...,"Hi everyone,

I've (32M) been single since January and trying to figure out this whole 'dating' thing again. I would prefer to meet someone naturally rather than through apps (wouldn't we all...) but I've found that one of the difficult things is it's very rare to have a natural conversation with someone that actually feels like it has chemistry. Most of the time, conversations are just friendly, or happen in a professional setting.

For example, I recently was at an event related to my industry where I met an interesting woman. Our conversation was mostly about our industry; I added her number which felt natural and not date-y because we're in the same industry.

We've texted back and forth a bit since the event, but it's all been about our line of work.

I would be interested in going on a date with her, but I've realized in these 'meet someone naturally' situations, there's like a line that has to be crossed...if I asked her out for a coffee, it would be crossing that line because it's unwarranted, there's no reason to ask her for a coffee. Plus, if I tried to 'backtrack' by somehow making the coffee purely about our industry, then it removes the sense that it would be intended to be a date.

Crossing the line feels difficult because there's no indication what the other person might think or how they might react. I get these thoughts, like, what if she rejects and then bad-mouths me to others in my industry? What if she already has a boyfriend/husband (which you can't really find out without crossing the line either)? It's most likely she's not into me, right, so all I'll do is embarass myself trying to cross the line?

I know I'm overthinking it because I'm new to dating again, but wondering how others think about this 'crossing the line' thing. Do it with confidence and hope for the best? Or wait for other more natural connections where the line seems to be crossed with no effort?",2,1757693765.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
