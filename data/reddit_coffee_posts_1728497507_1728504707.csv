I attached photos of the dagger that turned out okay, but isn’t practical due not being hard enough (planning on getting some square tubing for my forge to better control heat and testing cutoffs from this 1080 before heat treating the new knife-finishing the dagger was moreso to get my feet wet with guards and the wood lathe).

Background
 - 31 year old male, 5’11” 280lbs (was 300)
 - Carnivore for 3 weeks, tracked macros hitting or near hitting 70/30 daily.
- been strictly no carbs
- not diabetic (checked recently)
- had high cholesterol before beginning diet
- only drank water for last 3 weeks + 1 or 2 black coffees daily, no sugars or sweeteners.
- felt great, bags of energy ect… up until tonight.
- ex-smoker (10 per day) vaped for 2 years instead

Health scare / worry this evening 
- arrived at destination (150 miles drive, nothing extreme)
- made ribeye and 3 scrambled eggs after fasting for previous 20 hours
- ate that, felt fine, no issues, drank about 2.5L of water today too.
- after tea noticed I was struggling to read my phone, almost like I’d been dazzled, kinda like if you look directly at a lightbulb then something else it takes a while for the image of the bulb to disappear.
- went for a 45 minute walk to get some fresh air, other than vision been slightly off I felt fine.
- got in, read my WhatsApp messages which I could now see fine as eyesight got better with walking.
- could read but not understanding the words or type back.
- called my partner and could barley speak or communicate normally coming out with slurred words, mispronunciation, couldn’t think of words ect…
- couldn’t remember how to spell when texting, or string a legible sentence together.
- ended up sending my partner address to my airb&b as was worried on my own.
- we chatted, I drank more fluids, speech began to come back.
- heart rate circa. 100bpm at this point.
- didn’t have any facial signs of a stroke or headaches ect… I felt fine but was like my brain wasn’t working.
- hand started to feel numb, very nearly called for an ambulance.
- spoke to my partner again, she said perhaps have some carbs and sugar for instant energy.

Broke from the diet, ate 3, 30g bags of crisps (chips to my American friends) and about 200g of Haribo type sweets.

Now I feel absolutely fine, as you can see from above my brain works fine….
Been in keto a few weeks so I’m curious as to why I experienced low blood sugar when not diabetic?
Also not going to lie - I fucking shit myself feeling like this on my own and 250 miles from home 🫣

I'm so glad to have found some more recent posts regarding phentermine. I have been looking for more information and varying experiences as I've always been somewhat leery of taking any ""diet"" pills/medication. But as the saying goes, ""the struggle is real"" on the weight loss side of things for me.

I am 41yo female, 5ft, SW: 206 (heaviest in my life) and CW: 196. I have had 3 kids through c-section and have really struggled to lose weight and keep it off. After having my 3rd in 2021, I became more serious and made more of an effort working out starting last year June 2023. It helps that my husband is super disciplined and doesn't skip a work out during the weekdays. We have a setup in our basement so literally no excuses.

A quick background on my eating habits and health:

* I drink mostly water and never keep stock of any juices or soda/pop. But when fried chicken or pizza cravings creep up, I do reach for regular coke.
* I don't often eat fried stuff or anything greasy because it makes me feel really nauseous. But like noted above, I do get cravings here and there but they are few and far between.
* I love a good salad
* I prefer fish over any meat; I prefer vegetables from any meat if fish isn't available (many individuals, including my former roommate, thought I was vegetarian because of this)
* I am Asian and often have rice with my food, but it's not a deal breaker for me and I can live without it
* I am not into bread the way others are and I can definitely live without iT
* I am not into pasta the way others are and I can definitely live without it
* I don't like candy (like those that are made just with simply sugar and food dyes)
* I'll indulge in a cupcake or a slice of cake but we do not keep stock of these at home. Once it gone we won't get any until the next occasion that calls for it or a craving hits - which is not often.
* Chocolate is my WEAKNESS but I can't eat too much in one sitting or I'll get sick of it
* I'm not a snacker and do not snack throughout the day like others. However, I will indulge in a snack (a little salty + sweet, usually chocolate) once all the kids are done for the night and hubby and I are just chillin.
* All my bloodwork has been all normal including hormones

I tried intermittent fasting seriously for the first time in November 2023, but I do feel like I intermittent fast inadvertently in the past by forgetting to eat certain length of time certain days cause I'm just terribly busy at work. I was doing 16/8 fasting but at some point I think I may have overdone it by not breaking my fast on time, working out even without breaking fast. This caused me to pass out one time in front of my son and it scared him and my husband. Up until the passing out incident, I weighed 184 at my lowest since having kids, and was happy with it as I don't remember the last time I weighed under 190 since I started having kid back in 2013. To avoid passing out, I put an alarm to ensure I was breaking fast right at 16hrs and tried to eat things that would be beneficial to my IF, i.e. Greek yogurt with almonds, strawberries, etc. When I started consistently breaking my fast on time, my weight hit a plateau. I then would fluctuate between 186-188 and then slowly creeped up to 188-190. And now I most fluctuate between 194-197. Due to some minor injuries, which I didn't want to exacerbate for fear of it getting worse and actually not being able to get back to working out, my workouts had become few and far between. I know that all types of ""diet"" are not for everyone. Even though I was fairly successful (it seemed) with IF, having the incident with passing out made me think this might not be something that my body is not compatible with.

Things were getting increasingly discouraging. So, I decided to visit the weight loss clinic since I had an existing referral. I was (and still am) desperate to figure out what's going on. I don't have terrible eating habits and don't constantly reach for ""bad"" foods. After a full blood work, hormones, and EKG (all tests came out normal) I was prescribed low dose (15mg) Phentermine. They considered Wegovy or Zepbound but insurance wouldn't cover it and it's a crazy amount out of pocket. For Phentermine, I was able to get an Rx coupon and instead of $45 for a month supply, I ended up paying only approximately $12. I was more willing and open to taking some medical intervention as part of my weight loss journey, knowing I'll be under the watchful eye of a medical professional.

Today is day one and I am super hopeful that I won't have any of the bad side effects. I took it at 9:35am and at 10:56am, my fingers started feel jittery. I did drink coffee shortly after so that could be contributing to the jitters. I also have terrible anxiety and partake take a few hits of cannabis (vape) to just keep me calm and help me go sleep. My weight loss doctor said I can continue to vape but to watch out for anxiety.

Good luck to everybody with their weight loss journey on Phentermine. I hope it will all help us and we don't experience any bad side effects cause just thinking of having bad side effects is giving me bad anxiety =(",2,1728503653.0,Phentermine_,0,1.0,False

Anyways my main question is, does anyone else feel food coming up whenever they do workouts where you are bent over (downward facing dog) or pressing on your stomach (cobra yoga pose)? I have had this problem since I began working out again but it has been so long since I purged. 

  
I find that it is less of a problem if I only have like coffee and a protein bar, wait 30 minutes to an hour to workout and I *mostly* am okay. If I eat like a normal meal and wait 1-2 hours I still have the problem. I've even tried waiting 3-4 hours but it still does not seem to help after I've eaten a normal meal...

  
Does anyone have a solution to this? 

  
I follow work out videos for reference, so I can't exactly edit out certain things myself and I cannot always workout early in the morning after my light breakfast. I also have a terribly weak core, but I'm not sure that has anything to do with it? I had bad habits when I purged too to the point I could bend over and let it out.

1g00cv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1g00cv2/1_month_omeprazole_today_without_and_its_hell/,"1 month omeprazole, today without and its hell","In the last 10 years I sometimes had acid reflux. But it changed over time and some times I had nothing. Sometime crazy heartburn that I felt I could barely breathe.

The whole research on my body felt so amateur, despite living in a high tech country. Can you say me if that is all normal procedure?

Anyway I knew something was wrong and had an endoscopy by an 80 year old star doctor. After waking up I was alone behind a curtain and began to remove all the stuff in my arms, still half dreaming. After that the doctor immediately wanted to talk about it, I was still really zoned out and could not process exactly what I was saying but he told me he found nothing and its just psychical. 

I knew I feel rather good and 2 weeks later he told me its helicobacter. He wrote me an recipe and I was going to get the antibiothics + omeprazole bundle, the pharmacys screen lit red and she told me she cant give me the medication because it could have deadly combination with my antidepressant escitalopram. 

I called the hospital and they told me I can take it. Even when there is the red alert because of heart attacks combining the stuff. So I called another doctor to be sure and she told me I can‘t take them. Then I asked a third one who told me I could. 

So I did take them. After that it felt good but no one has actally tested if it was really gone. So I called the hospital and they told me its gone on the phone. But I read medical standard procedure of helicobacter and you should test it. So I had to talk them full of I want to have it tested. 

I had a test where I had to exhale in a plastic lab „glass“, which he after taking the probe, accidentaly hold turned down and screwed the top on it like 2-3 minutes after. Test was negative. 

I had 2 years ok reflux but now its fully back. Sometimes I have short breath and back pain and reflux at the same time. Anyway doctor told me I should take 40mg omeprazole for 30 days and then „only in need single ones“. I took them 30 days and my life was as new. I could eat everything. Now I had the first day without one and its horrible again. Just as the day before I took omeprazole. 

The biggest problem is that doctors here all need to be told what you want. They dont ask questions or investigate by themselves or even have ideas about what to do. 

What are your thoughts about my story and how should I proceed? Take omeprazole as single ones? But I need to take them before the reflux builds up and basically as I had them every morning it was just awesome. I dont think its a medication for short term relief when having it refluxing already. 

I can‘t eat do Coffee, McDonalds, Chips, Burgers, Croissants, Carrots, Milk Ice Cream and much more but with omeprazole I could eat all of it on one single day

Edit: I also want to add that I have puked really bitter orange acid stuff for like 10 times in 3 years. Internet told me „get to ER“ but I felt good after it and found it overkill. But the doctors never said anything when I told them that. Is it now dangerous or not? ",2,1728503364.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

My partner (not on Reddit) is looking for someone to takeover his lease in downtown Brooklyn. The building is in a super convenient location, 5 minutes away from target, Trader Joe’s, and Whole Foods. It’s also right by a ton of trains (2, 3, 4, 5, Q, R, D, and more!).

It’s close to Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, and by a ton of cool restaurants and coffee shops! It’s also right down the street from one of my favorite bookstores, the Center for Fiction :)

The building is a doorman building with a gym, lounge, game room, and rooftop with grills! The people who work here are phenomenal and incredibly nice, they really go above and beyond to make sure we’re doing ok ❤️

**Apartment details**: Rent is $3000 a month and is available starting November 15. The lease ends March 8, 2025 with the option to renew. Water and gas is included, you would just need to pay for electric and WiFi! Apartment has an in-unit washer and dryer. 

Not furnished, but open to selling some of the furniture (can send pics if interested).

The security deposit (one month’s rent) would be paid up front!

Please reach out if you’re interested or have any questions! :)

Nobody gets everything they ask for, that's fair. 

What's not fair is me prioritizing everyone elses comfort at the expense of my own. Attempting to make everything okay. Putting up with whatever. That any good they did makes it so I can't ask for anything. I understand women are often conditioned to respond this way, and I am trying to break that. 

It's such a habit to rationalize not asking for basic things. Emotionally, it's easier than expecting other people to respect me. It's a way to negate feeling disrespected and neglected. I'm gaslighting myself. 

It would be unreasonable to ask someone to stop slurping their coffee and then get mad when they do. It is not unreasonable to ask them or even expect them to stop slurping.

BUT. I'm one of the older people there and when I started I did a lot of cleaning up after people because I can't take the mess.

I've been told recently that when I do the late shift, I'm responsible for cleaning up all that stuff and I just refused. Unless it directly affects the kids, I leave it there. 

Now I'm in kind of a stand off with them saying ""we all have to help each other out"". I get that, and if it were occasionally I wouldn't mind as much. Also, I don't leave my shit lying around for days so it's not equal.

1g004oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1g004oe/speaking_with_witnessess_and_they_broke_up_with_me/,Speaking with Witnessess and they broke up with me,"I have been meeting with a pair of Witnesses for the past couple of months. Probably 5 or 6 visits total. Last week, they broke up with me.

Little bit of background: I have never been a member of the Jehovah Witnesses, but I have exited a fairly strict form of Calvinistic evangelicalism. I enjoy having conversations with people I disagree with and am always looking for an opportunity to update my beliefs based on new evidence. I would call myself an atheist but if there is a god, I would genuinely like to know.

I met a Witness outside of my work while I was on a break. I struck up a conversation and ask them what they believed. They told me they believed in Jehovah god and that he had a plan for the world. I asked him why he believed that. He seemed to struggle with that.

We exchanged numbers and by the end of the week I was in contact with a different fellow, Stan. I met with Stan at a coffee shop, one on one, later that month. I enjoyed our conversation as he seemed very genuine and showed me a willingness to admit when he didn’t know something or if something he had said seemed incorrect based on new light.

I could tell he had no knowledge of the history of the scriptures and the Christian movement as a whole. He also did not have any experience with arguments for god, formal or informal. He was semi apologetic about this. I told him that I wasn’t interested in that type of conversation per say. I just wanted to know why ***HE*** believed. What convinced him?

After that initial chat I invited him to come by my house. Eventually he did, and he brought a friend. His friend’s name was John and John was a bit more confrontational. He was unwilling to concede almost anything to me, even if I was just repeating back what he had said. Conversation was frustrating and slow going, but I continued to give them as much time as they would give me and seriously consider what they said.

Last Saturday, they came to my door again. We had scheduled a visit and upon arriving they notified me “We only have 15 minutes; we have some friends in the car.” This disappointed me as I looked forward to our visits.

Stan played a video for me. A Dr. described the complexity of the human brain and how, for him, it pointed to a god. He remarked “No Brain, no life.” I wrote that down as I am a naturalist and I agree with that statement, but I would assume that the Witnesses believe that god is alive and yet he doesn’t have a physical brain. We never got to that.

I said, “I am familiar with this argument that, to us, life is so complex it appears unlikely, so their fore there must be a god (I couldn’t remember the phrase ‘fine tuning’), here would be my pushback. We can imagine how many different gods might exists. Maybe a god who wants a universe of only black wholes or a god who wants a universe of frog people, and yet we got the god that we got who happened to want and be able to create this exact universe. Doesn’t that seem unlikely? Do we think maybe that god is designed by something else?”

This was an extremely difficult point to get across and I had to repeat myself in different words numerus times to get them to even comprehend what I was saying.

Eventually, Jon remarked, “Well, that doesn’t seem very convincing to me.”

To which I replied, “That is exactly how I feel about the video you showed me.

“Then why not just agree to disagree? I don’t enjoy having these conversations with pushback.”

“What? You mean you like talking with people who just… agree with you?”

“Yeah.”

This struck me as so odd to hear out of the mouth of Jon. I assume he spends hours every week knocking on strangers doors and asking them to consider changing their world view to match his, and yet put in a position where he has to actually think about what he is saying caused enough cognitive dissonance that he wanted out.

Stan told me his theory on why I didn’t believe in god was because “You are young and haven’t had hard times in your life.” Jon and him theorized about how the people who were in the hurricanes in the east were probably much more open to their message.

I tried not to take offence at their condescension, and actually agreed. I described belief in god as a warm blanket in a cold night. Something to give you hope and remarked that I could remember how good that felt, but just because something feels good it doesn’t mean its true.

Jon challenged me saying that isn’t what they believed. I tried to look for clarification as all I had done was repeat back what they had said and added my own experience into the mix, but they had been in my living room for 20 minutes and were looking to escape.

About 40 minutes after our conversation, Stan texted me.

“You are a very hospitable young man! Thank you for your time!”

I was feeling pretty down. My goal was not to de-convert these men. I was looking for a respectful conversation about our beliefs and to understand them better.

About 7 hours later, Stan texted me again. This time several paragraphs.

“Why are you so interested in conjecture about what ifs? Sounds a bit like the multi-universe concept with endless variables… I don’t understand your strong interest in somewhat extreme science supposition… and while that is not something I deem worthy of serious consideration given where we are in the stream of time given fulfillment of prophecy… I do want you to know that I’ve enjoyed some of our past discussions-”

Reading that text made my blood boil.

I never once discussed multiverse theory with either of them, nor do I support it as a theory. In fact, they never even asked me about my theory of the universe. To read him say that he didn’t find a theory that I never even mentioned “worthy of serious consideration” while I sat across from him week after week and listened to ill informed, conjecture and respectfully talked through every point- not to mention, the only reason we were “so interested in what ifs” is because **that is the argument they presented to me.**  

I replied with a lengthy, strongly worded text challenging him on everything I have mentioned in this retelling. I tried to remain cordial, but I did not hide the fact that his disrespect and condescension did not go unnoticed.

He was semi apologetic in the reply.

We exchanged emails now and I assume he will be taking whatever I say to someone he believes is a reliable source, seeking their advice, and then returning with that information.

In my head, I am aware of the brain washing and manipulation a cult can do to its members, but experiencing someone treating me like this, in my own home… I’m frustrated and bummed out, to say the least.

I hope to get a reply to the email I sent him, and still be able to talk to someone who thinks different then me, but I don’t know how to do that with a brick wall.

I don’t understand how someone can just appeal to authority over and over and not even realize that is what they are doing. How someone can play a video they expect me to see and understand and have no comprehension of what that video is saying. How someone can believe something and have no idea why they even believe what they believe.

I don’t know, I guess I just needed to vent. Feel free to eat me alive in the comments or just say nothing at all. I should know better, but I don’t. Should I just give up on JW’s as a group? Surely there is someone in this organization who understands what they believe and why they believe it? I mean, who’s writing the scrips for these videos? Who’s putting these articles in the Watchtower?

I don’t know. I’d appreciate any advice.

Thank you for your time, and I hope you all have a great rest of your day.",7,1728502782.0,exjw,1,1.0,False

---
The kick came in on Sam’s leg at the worst possible time, as he was busy focusing his attention on the men to his front. It almost buckled under the blow, forcing him to pull back for a moment and respond to the attacker.

He was a lanky man, dressed in a faded and beaten t-shirt, grinning at the clear success he had registered against Sam. That grin disappeared in a flash, as Sam brought the baton against him, striking him in his moment of triumph. Then Corporal Goose came crashing in on the man’s side, and he was quickly put down on the ground.

Sam took the chance to take stock of the rest of the platoon. It was, quite frankly, a mess. Gornall and Smedley were closely packed together to his front, swinging their shields and batons to form a barrier to the section of the crowd that had focused on them. Trevor was scuttling over to them, fending off a lone attacker in an attempt to form a new line. Off to the front, Hennessey was currently on fire, flames licking up the fire-resistant suit she wore. The rest of the unit stood to Sam’s rear, advancing up amidst the hail of bricks and other objects being sent their way.

Goose pushed up beside Sam, allowing the man he had downed to be grabbed by someone else, who Sam couldn’t quite identify under their bulletproof mask. He looked back to his front, where there were still multiple men and women yelling. One threw a brick, which bounced off the transparent shield. Sam refreshed his grip on the shield, before raising his baton into the air and shaking it forwards.

“Tighten up!” Sam ordered, a solid line quickly developing alongside him. The crowd responded in kind, swarming around the increasingly overwhelmed soldiers to his front. They kicked and shoved, but they had no idea what was about to descend on them.

Sam began to smack his shield with his baton, the age-old warcry of a baton charge, one he was quickly joined in by his comrades. On a pre-agreed count of hits on their shields, they charged, slamming into the agitated crowd that had not anticipated such coordinated aggression. Several rioters fell instantly, knocked to the ground by direct hits, while others jumped backwards in pain or shock. Composure was quickly regained, pushing and shouting back, but the UN troops had mass, armour, and determination. Every blow a rioter delivered enabled a counterblow with a baton or a shield, and soon the crowd was pulling back, amidst bruises and swears of pain. Projectiles continued to rain, and one man, taking advantage of the clearing crowd, tossed a molotov cocktail directly at Sam’s boots.

He kept his composure, remembered his training. Sam, along with a few other soldiers affected by the impact, pulled back, stamping his boots rapidly one after the other to get rid of the flames. The tactic, combined with the fireproof clothing, worked, and he was soon free, simply manoeuvring around the burning puddle on the ground and continuing forwards. A few more steps, and he was beside Gornall, Smedley, and Trevor who were quickly incorporated into the advancing mass of soldiers. They moved to the back, to be replaced by more fresh troops.

Hennessey, meanwhile, was almost completely aflame, a wide berth formed around her as she lay on the ground rolling. Before Sam could lead the rest of the unit to reach her, a man in a hi-vis suit stepped up and sprayed her with a fire extinguisher, a whistle being blown.

“Alright, everyone halt!” Captain Faulder bellowed, and suddenly the yelling crowd turned peaceful, the rain of projectiles stopping. The exercise marshal who had just put her out was now checking her, as Sam abandoned the exercise to check up on his soldier.

“You alright there soldier?” The man asked, removing his helmet. The rest of the platoon began to follow suit, Sam included. As Emma pulled her armoured facemask off, Sam looked up and down her uniform, seeing no obvious holes. Her equipment was now in the hands of one of the ‘rioters’, however, who was currently trading it to another man as he pulled out a water bottle.

“Feel like shit.”

“That’s normal. Any of it get through your gear?” The marshal replied, seeming to be satisfied with his visual inspection.

“No, I don’t think so.”

""You need to focus, just remember the training. Step back, stamp it away, evade the source.""

""I know, Sarge."" Emma replied, sitting up on the road and catching her breath.

""Then put it into practice. And you can't let yourself get separated like that. You do that for real, you fuck it up for everyone. This is a *team*, Private.""

Sam let his words sink in for a moment, looking around. The training exercise had been conducted inside the base, one of a series of riot control exercises that the UN forces were undertaking. The hope was that these skills would never be needed, but it was best to train anyway. Currently, Sam's company was playing police, whilst volunteers from the other companies attempted to fight back. Sam wasn't looking forward to it being *his* turn to have a baton slamming into his arm.

“We’ll be taking a break for a while, might be swapping with another platoon. Go find Corporal Emptage, get changed out of this suit, sit down for a bit.” Sam ordered, having given Emma time to stew on what he'd said. “You still did a good job holding your own, you just need to focus on avoiding the last word there.” That last bit was a lie, she frankly hadn't done too well. But it was the kind of lie a sergeant told their soldier after giving them a damning criticism, one that at least made them feel better.

“Yes Sarge.” Emma stood up, heading off to find the Corporal. Before Sam could do anything else, one of the men who had just been playing rioter came up to him, holding the recovered shield and baton.

“Christ Sam, I’m gonna have to get you back for smacking me on my arm like that.” Sergeant Briggs grinned, offering the equipment. Sam simply dropped his own, Briggs doing the same.

“I’ll make sure to shotput a brick right at your head when it’s your turn.”

“I welcome the day you can hit something, Sam.”

“Alright there?” Danny appeared beside the pair of NCOs, ushering another marshal over to collect Emma's shield and baton. He offered Sam a water bottle, which he gratefully accepted.

“Yeah. I got a pretty hard kick to the leg but otherwise that was fun. Should be good playing the other side.”

“So long as we’re having fun, then. Hell happened with Hennessy?”

“She charged off up ahead of the group, got surrounded.” Sam replied, taking a brief break midsentence to sip again. All this riot control practice and being set on fire had a tendency to make you a bit warm. “One tried to get to her, got surrounded. Two morel attempted to cover *him*, et cetera. Broken coordination.”

“That’s the killer. Someone runs off up front, people try to help, and it gets worse. If this had been a real riot, I mean shit. All it takes is one guy in the crowd with a pistol.”

“Yup. That one’s got problems, you know.” Sam had made a quick check to ensure they were out of earshot of the rest of the unit before he said that.

“I know.” Danny shook his head.

“Does she? Always seemed a bit withdrawn to me.” Briggs replied. “Don’t see her about that much.”

“You didn’t hear about her nearly starting a riot a few days ago?” That whole incident was, though their commanders hadn’t said as much, why there was suddenly a whole block of riot control training on the menu for the UN forces in Colorado. 

Of course, its public impact had been largely overshadowed by the dust storm that had followed, destroying whole towns and coating others in radioactive dust that was probably still being scrubbed. Sam and his soldiers had spent a tedious few hours in a bunker until being retrieved, emerging to find the town almost completely levelled. FEMA had promptly found presumably atrocious refugee accommodation for the locals, whilst the ex-Collaborator whose return had provoked the near-riot had disappeared to live elsewhere in the country. Or maybe in Canada, or something. Certainly, they weren't causing trouble right now, and that was enough.

“Oh, that was her?”

“Yeah.”

“Fair.”  

“I’m just glad we haven’t had shit go real south. I’m sure, against Hekatians, she’d behave herself. But she has a real problem with control when it comes to people screaming bloody murder in her face.” Sam replied, grimacing.

“It’s not that easy.” Corporal Goose had drifted over, joining the conversation. Before Sam could reply, Goose quickly spoke again. “I mean, you’re right. There is a problem. But it’s not that easy.”

“Sure. But being a soldier doing *this* kinda duty means you should be able to deal with it. It's aggression, but it's *controlled* aggression.”

“Course.”

Sam caught sight of something in the sky, off near the perimeter fence of the base. It got larger, and while he couldn’t make out any specific detail, the shape was clearly no bird. It was a drone, being flown into the base perimeter.

“Uhh, possible problem.”

“Whe… ah shit. I’m gonna have to get base security.” Danny replied.

Before he could do that, however, there was a crackle of gunfire from the base entrance. The drone continued flying on, however, seemingly heading for the UN troops. People began to look around, and start taking cover.

Then a machine gun opened up, one on a fixed mount somewhere. It quickly got a far better bead on the drone, and in seconds it exploded, it’s parts falling to the ground. Sam let out the breath he realised he had been holding. Maybe it hadn’t been a threat, just some moron with a camera drone. But it wasn’t a great sign.

“Brilliant. Just brilliant.” Danny muttered, shaking his head. Sam looked around, seeing the barely perceptible head of a soldier on the roof of the UN barracks. He remembered the paranoid conversation he had with one of those men, and wondered where that man would turn now.

“We cancelling training, then?” Briggs asked, sounding mournful.

“Nah, screw it. Keep the fun going. Get Hennessey, see if she's ready or not, and we will continue regardless. Briggs, I suggest you get a move on before we kick your arse again.""

“Aye. I’ll get you eventually Sam.”

“Sure you will.”

---

“Alright, here’s our stop.” Sam ordered, the Boxer turning off into a large parking area outside the small town school. More vehicles followed them in, a mix of Boxers, coaches, and lorries, carefully navigating their way in. A crowd had gathered to watch the arrival, though they were particularly interested in the coaches. It would be a nightmare to fit everything, but they would manage it. “Everyone out, let’s get this ball rolling.”

1 Section began to exit the vehicle as the coaches came to a halt. The first was heavily modified, serving instead as effectively a dental surgery on wheels, packed with everything that one would need short of extensive surgery. It’s compatriot, meanwhile, just carried the staff, with space to take anyone who would need more care to a proper hospital. Finally, the lorries were packed with useful supplies to distribute, since there was no point wasting a chance to give things out.

Said staff poured out, heading over to get the vehicle set up. Notably, a few members of them were Hekatian, part of the growing efforts to get Hekatians to be seen as *allies* after the war. The rest were foreign volunteers, random good-minded civilians from all over the world with skills and a desire to help.

Sam disembarked the Boxer as Lt Skinner clambered on top of his own, holding a megaphone and beginning to talk to the crowd. The sections of troops formed into well-ordered lines, to clearly delineate the different queues that would be set up. Helmets were off, berets on instead, and most equipment was left in the Boxers, including rifles. The exception, of course, was the Hekatian members of each unit, who wore their armour as ever, since it was more inconvenient to take off and put on in an emergency, though they still showed their face and did their best to look friendly.

“Listen up everyone!” Lt Skinner began speaking to the assembled people. “Families, form a queue to the left, beside Corporal Emptage! Corporal Emptage, give us a wave!”

Corporal Emptage waved, a friendly smile on her face.

“Children and families will be seen first, youngest to eldest. If you do not have children, form a queue to the right, with Corporal Goose! Corporal Goose!”

Corporal Goose waved, not doing the same friendly appearance as Emptage.

“Everyone will be seen, do not worry!”

The crowds began to organise themselves as requested, whilst soldiers of 3 Section, who lacked a queue to supervise, began to fetch items from the lorry in order to distribute amongst the people. After a while, the clinic was operational, and began to admit patients. The first to enter the bus was a lone mother and her three kids, of various ages. Then another family, a mother and father with a 2 year old child.

The cramped converted coach was hardly the best environment for dental care, but it was better than nothing, as far as anyone was concerned. There was only so much that could be done, but a checkup here could lead to proper care down the line, and that was something at least. 

“Hey, Sarge, look at this.” Corporal Baccup tapped Sam on the shoulder as he watched the crowd, causing him to turn around. Baccup stood beside Private Rossi, who had split open a humanitarian ration, one of the pink American-made ones that had been dug out of a bunker somewhere, and was rifling through the contents. Elsewhere, Private Earle was fishing things out of a different ration box, stuffing some into her pockets and offering others to Clachiey, 3 Section's Hekatian. At least they had the decency to do so thoroughly out of sight of the civilians.

""Not sure you're supposed to touch them, Private. They're for the civvies.""

""Some of the boxes split before we opened the truck up. Few of the contents are split as well, civvies wouldn’t want it anyway. Besides, we're just giving these out so they have some in the basement for an emergency, it's not like they'll starve without it.” Sam looked to Corporal Baccup, who nodded to confirm the private’s story. “Look what I wanted to show you, though, see this?""

Rossi produced a chocolate bar, turning it around to show Sam the back side.

“Win free tickets to the Paris Olympics.” Sam read off the back of the chocolate bar. “Huh. That was…”

“2024, yeah.” Rossi finished.

“God, it’s worse than the stuff they were giving us after the Liberation. There’s no way that stuff is in date, right?” Sam had a rather harsh memory of the postwar civilian aid in the immediate aftermath of the Contact War, as the resources of the world were poured into rebuilding and redeveloping Britain. Of course, it had all turned out rather well for them, but the same could not be said for the way the Americans were being treated.

“You’d be surprised. I mean, there was that guy who used to eat hundred year old rations and shit for youtube before the war, and he was fine. Mostly.”

“What happened to him? Is he still around?” Baccup asked.

“No idea.”

“Still making those videos, he lives in Australia now.” Lance Corporal Hartley interjected, having come over to see what his squadmates were chatting about.

“Does he? Good for him.” Baccup said.

“Yeah. Apparently the Aussies make good humrats these days.”

“I dunno, maybe that Taiwanese plane crashed cos the pilots got food poisoning.” Rossi laughed at his own joke, but no one else joined him.

“Not funny man, I got family in Taiwan.” Hartley scowled.

“I dunno, it’s insanely funny for the whole government to die in a single plane crash.” The plane had taken most of the upper echelons of the government with them into the sea, leaving the country leaderless and causing a constitutional crisis on top of an existing economic one. Hartley responded with a single middle finger, which Sam reckoned probably settled an argument this stupid.

“Anyway, Sarge, come look at these posters.” Hartley walked off. Sam shrugged, having nothing better to do, and seeing the crowd simply progressing along through the medical help on offer. A few people were currently in conversation with Lt Skinner about something or other, but whatever it was, it was probably not too important. So, Sam followed Hartley to a collection of posters and sheltered noticeboards that had been set up along the walls of the school, serving as a sort of community information spot. There were a variety of things stuck up there, mostly people advertising various things they could do to help one another, such as stuff they had grown in allotments, spare equipment they didn't need, or expertise in repairing things.

But these weren’t the most eye catching one. No, the most eye catching poster was a stylised drawing of a soldier in a full gas mask, staring directly at the viewer. The lens showed a reflection of a bombed out city, rubble and ruins, along with the wide blue eyes of the soldier, pulling a face that indicated shock. One phrase was written across the poster, half at the top of the poster and half at the bottom: “hell no, we won’t glow!”

“Nice ring to it.” Sam said, looking at the poster.

“Yeah. Hell of a lot of effort put in.”

“Seriously. They must have had some real artists working on this.” Sam examined it closer, seeing another piece of writing on the poster, in small letters, simply saying “Colorado Anti-Draft League”. Clearly, that was whoever had come up with the design.

“They’ve really watered it down now back home, you know. My little brother just got to draft age and he went straight to Civil Defence Corps, they let him in and it’s crowded.”

“Huh. Makes sense I guess.”

“You volunteered, right Sarge?”

""I started training pre-war. Then an invasion got in the way.""

""Ah, yeah. Bet you never imagined ending up here.""

""Definitely not. Fight in a resistance, fight in a real army for the largest war in Human history, fight through a nuked city, fight on the surface of the Hekatian homeworld, then end up with this lot out in the middle of nowhere.""

""Sarge, not trying to be rude, but I mean. You absolutely qualify for demobilisation. No way you don't. And you're always grousing. Like, why didn't you?""

“Because what else would I do?”

“Go home and be with your girlfriend?”

“*For work*. Besides, she’s fine with me being here. Like I said, I've done more dangerous shit.”

“They’d probably let you transfer to instructing or something. Plenty of experience.”

“Teaching’s important, but you just end up feeling like you’re sending people off to do what you should. Sergeant school, I saw all those instructors, they looked like they wished they were out here instead.""

""I guess. I dunno, if I was in your position, I'd feel like I'd done my bit.""

""Remind me what you did in the war.""

""Kept me at home, ended up battling it out in South London and helping to crush the landings. Nasty, but not as nasty as New York was.""

""I've heard enough stories I don't personally buy the idea anyone has some special too-far experience. If you fought, you can either take a bit more, or you can't. Doesn't matter what you did.""

“Makes a bit of sense, I guess.”

The pair went silent, having exhausted what they wanted to say on that line of conversation.

“Sarge, need you back with the vehicles.” The radio crackled to life with the voice of Lt Skinner. “Civvie reported they found a suspicious object yesterday, possible bomb. EOD has been informed, just need a few guys to provide security. Reckon you can take 3 Section down?”

“Sure.” 

""Grab your gear from your Boxer, get em in and get on the move. Should be a quick job, no troubles.""

""On it."" Sam tapped Hartley on the shoulder, nodding back towards the vehicles. “Let’s roll.”

“Gotcha, Sarge.”

Sam took a final glance at the posters, seeing one he had previously ignored, buried under a bunch of different notes and messages. It was a drawing of a Hekatian landing ship, the long cylindrical craft that had brought the invasion forces of the Hekatians to Earth. The design was far cruder, and its message far more rhetorical than it’s anti-draft counterpart. It simply ordered its viewers to “KEEP WATCHING THE SKIES”.

---

“Here comes something.” Rossi announced, nodding towards a van that had just appeared around the corner. Sam watched as it drew closer, before stopping in front of the roadblock that Sam and a few others were manning. The door opened, the driver waving as he stepped out.

“Probably our man, looks like his vehicle. Alright, I want two to give me a hand, everyone else stay on the roadblocks.” Sam ordered, jogging over toward the man as he opened up his van. Given the circumstances, they had also put on their full gear: plate carriers, helmets, and all.

“Sorry I took so long, I was at work and got the call. Had to get home for the van.” The man explained, offering his hand. “Arnold Davies, I’m your EOD.”

“At work?” Hartley had followed Sam over, as well as Corporal Patanjali, who had attached himself to this mission. Sam had been willing to allow it, but the lack of space even in the cavernous Boxer meant Patanjali had spent the ride sitting in the open air atop the Boxer's turret. To his credit, he hadn't complained. “Is this not your job?”

“I do electrical work most days. This I just do on call.”

“Contractor?”

“Yeah."" Sam explained. ""We have our own EOD people, but they’d take longer to get here. So we occasionally contract locals, saves us time.”

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.” The man replied. “Did this stuff in the war for a guerilla unit, figured, shit, there’s so much left over, might as well do some good. So I do odd jobs as people need them. Bit extra cash to spend on my kids, does some good.”

He pulled out a large suit from the back of the van, what looked like an improvised bomb disposal suit. Sam could see salvaged parts of Hekatian body armour making up the suit, plates covering layer upon layer of padding. People were nothing if not ingenious.

“Give me a few minutes, I’ll put this on and get to work. Gonna need a hand though.”

“I’ll do it.” Hartley offered.

“Sure.”

Sam retreated towards the roadblock they had just been manning, followed by Patanjali. The pair stood watching, waiting for Arnold to emerge.

“You know what they say about those bomb suits? It’s an all or nothing.” Patanjali said, after a while of silence.

“Whaddya mean?”

“Say I went and fiddled with that thing, the bomb, and it goes off. But it’s a shit bomb. It might take off an arm or a leg. Maybe blind me. Point of the suits is, you can walk away intact from *that* shit. But if a bomb was big enough to kill, it *kills*. You either walk away from a bomb, or you don’t.”

“Huh.” Sam wasn't sure how credible that theory was, and certainly wasn't one to test it.

“I dunno how well Mister Arnold’ll take a blast though. Them things, they gotta resist pressure too. Fragmentation is only part of it. The improvised suits, they generally don't know to look for pressure, or how to build against it.”

“How’d you know this stuff?”

“Had family that did bomb disposal in the Troubles. They figured this shit out for themselves.”

“And you chose the infantry, with a family tradition like that?”

“Seemed safer.” Patanjali replied. “Besides. Better to be the guy that stops the bomber than to be cleaning up.”

“I don’t see us stopping many bombers.” Sam replied.

“You never know.” Before Sam could say anything, the EOD man appeared around the corner, waddling into view. He had additionally donned a welding mask and ear protectors, which left Sam increasingly suspicious as to the actual quality of the suit. Hartley walked beside him, grinning.

“Alright, let’s get this done.”

Everyone withdrew from their positions, Sam included, using the Boxer as cover. Hartley had received a walkie talkie from the man, and so Sam held it, listening as he watched.

Arnold approached the suspicious object, which had been uncovered to the sides of a clearing. It had been the site of some sort of artillery bombardment during the war, as craters visibly dotted the area, and had felled a fair number of trees. Quite what the man who reported it had been doing wandering around in the grass here was beyond Sam, but then just because he did something stupid didn’t mean it wasn’t worth clearing a potential bomb.

Arnold took a knee, and began to almost crawl the final distance. He reached the object, slightly exposed by being part of the rim of a shell crater.

“Can’t imagine what it must be like to do that.”

“Prepare to meet thy god.”

Arnold began brushing at it, something Sam was sure was *definitely* not the safest way to proceed. Maybe that was why Arnold was cheap enough to justify contracting him. Hopefully not.

“Looks like a decent sized plastic box. Not a manufactured landmine. Sort of box you'd buy at a Walmart.”

“Gotcha. Thoughts?”

“Possible guerilla device. Roadside bomb or something. My unit didn’t use anything like this, but there were plenty of units.”

Sam let Arnold carry on working, digging the box out with his hands. The man was nothing if not gutsy. The work carried on for some time, before he spoke again, his voice full of confusion.

“Hold on. This isn’t a bomb.”

“What?”

“It’s… it’s a storage box. Someone buried this.”

“Like a time capsule?”

“Might be. Let me… holy moly, thats a lot of CDs.”

“CDs?” Private Scott, who was leaning over to listen, asked.

“What we used to store shit on before you knew *where* to shit, Scott.” Corporal Baccup shot back.

“I’m not that young, I know what they are.”

“It’s just a bunch of CDs, grouped together, they got labels on them.” Arnold carried on. “Yeah, I think this is a guy’s attempt at data preservation before the war. This one says Wikipedia.”

“You’re serious?”

""Yeah.""

""Can you really store all that on a CD?""

""Blu-ray is like 50 gigs, can probably fit Wikipedia on one of those if you don't keep any images or videos.""

""Arnold, just a quick check. Are they CDs, or Blu-ray?"" Sam asked.

""I... yeah, Blu-ray.""

""There you go, then."" Sam replied, settling that argument.

“Whole bunch titled Stack Overflow. Forward thinking.” Arnold continued to report.

“Even in nuclear war, the programmers still need to keep their sites.”

“Can you imagine if these have been wiped, though? I mean, jeez, all that effort, and then…”

“Blu-ray would be fine, can’t wipe that. It’s carved into the disk. Hardest task will be finding something that can play it.”

“Are we gonna test them when we get back?”

“Only if you’re willing to volunteer a laptop. No way these are getting plugged into anything important.” Sam replied, shutting that argument down. Much as they may be an attempt at data preservation, that didn't mean they couldn't also be preserving a computer virus. It would be quite something to have the base's computers crippled by a ransomware attack in which the hacker and his bank account had vanished in nuclear flame years earlier.

“Ah, c’mon man.” Arnold groaned into the radio.

“What?”

“It’s… well. I hope the label is wrong, I’ll say that much. Come have a look.”

Corporal Baccup jogged up to Arnold, taking the stack of CDs. He looked at them, before pulling a face.

“Well? What is it?”

“You might as well see for yourself.” Baccup replied, walking back and presenting the collection, as Arnold continued to scour the contents of the box. While Sam didn’t recognise the website name on the stack, it gave the impression this was absolutely some man’s *personal collection*, so to speak.

“Ah, shit, I remember reading stuff on that when I was… too young.” Rossi said, chuckling.

“Did not need to know that.” Baccup replied. Private Earle threw a quick thump into Rossi’s shoulder, earning her a nod of approval from Baccup.

“Yeah, we’re *definitely* not testing that one when we get back to base.” Sam muttered, getting an approving nod from Corporal Baccup. He could have sworn he saw something move in the treeline, and maybe the rustle of leaves.

“You know, I have to appreciate this man for putting in the effort to preserve *that much* material to wank to. No way he didn’t see that as altruism.”

There was a loud thud, followed by the sounds of dozens of birds taking to the skies. Arnold turned around in surprise, right as a plasma lance flashed through the air and struck him in the face. He collapsed, as another came terrifyingly close to Sam and the rest of the group, and bullets raced through the air.

Sam didn’t let himself think about that, though, just the simple priorities. His rifle snapped in the rough direction of the attackers, firing off rounds. Return fire, take cover, return effective fire.

“Contact!”

Cartridges ejected from his rifle, bounced off the handle, then off the ground, the roar of rifles soon joined by the pounding of a 40mm coating the treeline in explosives. Most threw themselves onto the road, or retreated behind the Boxer again, with Sam leaning out and firing his weapon. Corporal Baccup charged out towards the collapsed Arnold, before suddenly taking heavy fire. He made it all the way to the crater Arnold had been working in before being hit, bullets striking him and causing him to fall. Thankfully, no plasma had hit him as far as Sam could see.

“Anyone hit?” Sam yelled on the radio, having now ceased fire momentarily. As the words left his mouth, two things raced through his mind. Firstly, that Arnold was almost certainly dead. Secondly, that this was an attack done with *plasma*. Bullets, yes. But plasma, there were very few groups in the area with access to that sort of thing, and even fewer that dared to attack a UN force.

“I’m hit!” Corporal Baccup shouted. “I’m bleeding!”

*Good*, Sam thought to himself. *Well, not good he’s hit. Bad that he’s hit. Good that he’s bleeding.* If it was plasma, he wouldn’t be. Bullets were *far* easier to recover from. No other reports rushed in, everyone just continually firing into the treelines. *We blundered right into an ambush. Or did they find us, and coincidentally attack?*

“Covering fire!” Sam ordered, the guns continuing to thunder away into the treeline. The enemy fire seemed to slacken, either because they were going down, or because they were suppressed. Either worked.

When Sam was certain the order was understood, he got up, moving forwards in a low dash to quickly clear the ground. Again the plasma returned, but Sam was too low, too fast, or the shooter was too suppressed. Either way, Sam made it to the crater, throwing himself inside in a jumbled landing. Baccup was laying in the crater, rapidly bandaging his leg even as blood seeped into the ground from a wound in the arm. Bullets continued to fly overhead, the British forces certainly throwing a lot more the attacker’s way than the reverse. That was something to note.

“He was gone by the time I got to him.” Baccup half muttered, frantically bandaging his leg with increasingly blood covered fingers. Sam glanced over the rim of the crater, seeing no one approaching, and dropped his rifle, letting it swing to his side as he crawled over to Baccup. Sam opened up his own first aid kit, getting to work on the arm. “Shit, I’m done for.”

“You’re okay, you’ll make it. Trust me.” Sam replied, hands flying around in order to wrap the bandage, with the kind of precision that could only be achieved by plenty of real world experience. Someone from the British force fired a grenade into the trees, only adding to the devastation the 40mm cannon was pouring in.

“I’m fucked. I’m fucked. If you’re telling me that, I-""

“Focus. I’ve seen worse, Josh. You’ll make it.” Sam carried on, already near finished bandaging the arm wound. A hand grenade detonated nearby, spraying shrapnel everywhere. A piece bounced off Sam’s helmet, but otherwise he was safe. *Who the fuck threw that*?

Sam poked his head back over the crater rim, and after a moment, an answer presented itself. Amidst shouts in a language Sam did not speak, came a strange figure charging through the trees. A Hekatian, clutching an American assault rifle with a bayonet, and clothed in beaten up scraps clearly scrounged together. He wore a cargo vest that was being used as webbing, ammo and grenades haphazardly packed inside.

Sam’s hand whipped to his rifle, as he took to a knee to get a better firing position. The attacker fired first, his shots true, but slamming into Sam’s body armour, to no effect but a painful thud against his chest. Sam fired back, simply holding down the trigger with the rifle pointed roughly on target. The Hekatian’s momentum carried him forwards, but it could only keep him up so long before he fell. Maybe alive, though.

“Need support up here!”  Sam yelled, giving warning to the rest of the section. His mind raced for possible solutions. He was ahead of everyone else, with a wounded soldier nearby, under attack from charging enemies. Really, he had to buy time for the rest of the unit to reach him.

Sam made a final check on Baccup, seeing that his blood was now mostly staying inside his body, and focused on his shooting. He had a top tier sight on his rifle, one of the best fielded by the army in general, and yet all he could see was well concealed figures, lying prone and firing towards him and the rest of the section. These guys were *good*, even if the one that had just rushed Sam wasn’t. He wondered what the story was with that, but it wasn’t the most pressing issue right now.

He kept firing, until his rifle ran empty. With practiced precision, Sam ejected the spent magazine, pulled a new one out, and slapped it in, then sliding the bolt forwards. More rounds continued to whizz overhead, concerningly close.

“Sarge!” Corporal Patanjali appeared to the side, firing his rifle at unseen targets. The dull thump of an underbarrel grenade launcher repeated, one of the few trees that had survived the pasting the Boxer had given taking a direct hit. “I’ve got the Corporal.”

Sam looked back into the forest, seeing the enemy fire slacken as they tried to pull back. Smoke poured from the treeline, the work of smoke grenades, a textbook retreat. On the one hand, now was a perfect time to pursue, and try to catch them before they slipped away. On the other hand, this was a bunch of Hekatians waging a guerilla campaign, and clearly at least somewhat well equipped. Sam had a single section, one Boxer, and a casualty, plus a potential enemy prisoner. They might step forwards straight into a fresh trap, actual bombs.

As if to accentuate the point, there was the sound of another hand grenade going off, clearly thrown by the retreating Hekatians to catch out anyone that might be following.

“Check on that guy who charged us! See if he's alive, if he is I want that bastard alive!""

“Copy Sarge.” Patanjali ran to the side of the wounded Hekatian, joined by Clachiey, 3 Section’s Hekatian. Together they got to work bandaging up the wounds, while continuing suppressive fire was laid down on an enemy that had pretty much entirely withdrawn. “Pretty banged up! We’re going to need a medevac.”

“Aye.” Sam got up, sprinting to the Boxer. It’s guns had fallen silent now, but the turret continued to pivot, scanning for attackers. Sam clambered up the subtle footholds on the vehicle’s side, quickly reaching the turret. The vehicle’s commander, Lcpl Bouvier grinned at the sight of Sam.

“You okay Sarge?”

“I’m grand. You get command on the line?”

“Reinforcements on their way.”

“Tell them we need a proper search operation, we have Hekatian remnants and they’re bugging out. And make sure casevac is en route. 2 wounded, one prisoner, dead civvie contractor. *Urgent* casevac.”

""Is the Corporal ok?"" Bouvier asked, genuine concern in his voice.

""He'll make it, it's the prisoner I'm most worried about. Get *Hekatian* qualified doctors, especially."" Bouvier nodded, ducking down into the turret. Sam looked back to the rest of the unit, seeing Baccup being carried into the back of the Boxer for further treatment. The Hekatian prisoner got slightly more gentle treatment, unsurprising given he was certain to be in a more critical condition.

The Boxer ceased fire, no longer seeing any targets worth even suppressing fire. With that, the remainder of 3 Section ceased fire, and Sam was left to watch an increasingly still forest. Lcpl Hartley hurried back into the safety of the Boxer, clutching the recovered weapon, as Earle and Scott attempted to haul the dead body of Arnold back for shelter.

Scattered across the grass, mixed with blood and shell casings, were dozens of random Blu-rays. Their owner had not been able to recover them, presumably due to perishing in the war: now, the strange box had claimed a life of it’s own.

Sam looked at the lifeless body of Arnold, a man who had survived fighting the deadliest war in Human history as a guerilla, and had died due to a box of forum backups and porn, now a corpse being manhandled away. *What a fucking waste*.

For now I just buy 1 coffee out each day, but it's definitely adding up on the spending! But looking to get a decent little machine to make a flat white/cappuccino which isn't too expensive, ease of use and preferably a bean to cup machine. 



I'm not looking to spend more than £250-£300max (I know there's always lots of deals on) but from reading the forums, people recommend getting a decent grinder and upgrading equipment on top of that, so not sure whether it's worth spending an arm and leg on everything just for 1 coffee a day (or whether I won't necessarily have to upgrade equipment etc if I'm only opting for the 1 coffee a day)

Would love any tips/recommendations would be really helpful - every time I set on a machine I get swayed by the mix of reviews (being a coffee novice it's quite a difficult decision!).

1fzzupz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ureaplasma/comments/1fzzupz/success_story/,Success Story,"I, 28M, got ureaplasma in September 2023. Unsure from where. Could have been from receiving unprotected oral. Also could have been from cleaning my urethra with rubbing alcohol in an STD paranoia (and this messed up my biome) also could have been from unprotected anal sex.

Ureaplasma is crazy because it's INSIDE your body already, so it can be seen as an imbalance  rather than infection, which is also why it can *potentially* resolve on it's own.

So... symptoms were: burning, itching and a week of milky white-yellow discharge coming from penis.

Got very ""typical"" STD test, no help.

Also developed what looked like strep throat (culture negative) for a month accompanying.

Took 7 days doxycycline ""just in case"" which helped the throat, but not the penis.

Discharge went away, and pain all day was there for about 2 months.

Got tested for ureaplasma (due to reddit research) test was negative, because no first urine of day.

Took another test 2 weeks later, POSITIVE.

Had to lecture the doctor to give me both 2 weeks doxy + 5 days ZPAK.

By this time, symptoms were almost completely gone. Hydration was a major factor. Still is.

Took the doxy and zpak, no change. Tested again (first urine) negative.

Since then? Bladder feels small, sensitive to dehydration, some tingles and pain.

Another test 6 months later when symptoms resurfaced (urgency, pain, *no discharge)*, negative on everything UTI, urea, myco.

Conclusion? Once you have the imbalance, I think you're sensitive to imbalances again. Sex, yeast, exercise, etc, coffee, dehydration, alcohol...

I try to take probiotics, cranberry, hydrate BEFORE coffee.

Good luck. Reddit helped a lot but ALSO MADE ME SO PARANOID and FREAK OUT OVER EVERY SYMPTOM.",2,1728502065.0,Ureaplasma,2,1.0,False

It may not be the cheapest or best heat source for a 9Barista, but it looks nice, can deliver enough heat, and is just the right size for a 9Barista (or a size 3 Moka Pot). 

I've only had it since yesterday, so I can only give you some first impressions. Its thermal mass appears to be large in comparison to its electrical power, so it does not reach working temperature as fast as a gas stove or toaster. It will not react anywhere near as fast as a gas or induction stove. You'll have to plan ahead instead.

According to the manufacturer, the temperature at the fan grill increases about 100 ℃ per unit on the control knob scale. I think this translates into a rather steep increase in heat transfer per scale unit. I did some descaling today, and then I timed power level 6; Simmering started after ca 4 1/2 minutes, boiling after ca 5, and the valve opened after ca 5 1/2 minutes. The water was fairly cool at the beginning. 

When using a size 1 Moka Pot, filled with ca 80 ℃ water, a combination of 3 minutes at power level 4, + rest of the time on power level 2 was quite OK. The coffee trickled out at a slow and steady pace, thanks to this primitive heat profile.

**Do the events of Nov 2 make any sense?**

  
In this post we will walk through the events as Amanda and Raffaele describe them for the morning that the body was discovered.  
  
According to Amanda both of them slept in until 10:00-10:30am. Someone was using the Raffaele’s computer at 5:30am for half an hour and someone turned on his phone at 6:02am. Marco Quintavalle saw Amanda at his store at 7:45am. That they are lying is not disputable unless you accept the defence theory that Raffaele’s cat turned on the phone and that Marco is wrong about who he saw. The defence as far as I know never attempted to explain the 30 minutes of computer use – I suspect the cat will have to take the fall for that as well.  
  
According to Amanda’s story she left Raffaele’s to go have a shower at her house and to retrieve a mop and bucket because of the leak from the night before. Amanda’s packed bags were at Raffaele’s and he has a shower that, according to Amanda, they used that night but I still do not fault her for wanting to use her own bathroom and going home. So Amanda goes home.  
  
Arriving at home Amanda finds her front door open. She finds this odd but ignores it. The lock on the door apparently was iffy. Entering the house she walked to her bedroom to get undressed. Amanda’s ceiling light does not work so her only light source is her black lamp. This lamp was not present but Amanda does not notice, claiming that the natural sunlight was sufficient for her to undress. I believe most people would instantly notice it was missing but that she didn’t is not completely unbelievable.   
  
She now goes to the bathroom to take a shower. While this was never entered as evidence it appears to be a lie. Carmignani, a seasoned crime reporter, spoke to the police and they were suspicious of Knox’s story because her body odor was not that of someone who just had a shower two hours ago, her face was puffy, and her make-up was smeared. \[Nadeau 56\]  
  
Continuing with Amanda’s story after she finished showering she noticed the blood. It was in the sink and on the bathmat  
  
At this point she dismissed the blood as being a mess from one of the girls having a menstrual issue. That is completely unbelievable. The quantity of blood is just too much to be from Meredith having her period and it is also in the shape of a foot. At this point Amanda has come home to find her door open, blood in the sink, and a bloody footprint on the bathmat. Despite that she remains calm and continues with her day.  
  
Upon realizing that she was lacking a towel Amanda apparently uses the bathmat for modesty and returns to her room to get dressed. She would later explain that she used the bathmat as a magic carpet to move around and not get the floor wet. She returns the bathmat to the bathroom and goes to Filomena and Laura’s bathroom to do her hair. At this point she notices Rudy’s feces in the toilet. Amanda remarks that this is strange because the girls would never do that and she further knows that both Laura and Filomena are away for the weekend but again she dismisses it. According to Amanda she was “starting to feel a little uncomfortable”. I find her not being freaked out enough to at least do a room by room search unbelievable. That being said if we assume she still wasn’t scared then I also find her choice to not flush the toilet perplexing. She knows both of the girls who use that bathroom are away for the next 24-36 hours and the feces has been there for 12 hours at this point but she just finishes getting ready in a stinky bathroom and does not flush.  
  
Amanda leaves the big bathroom and returns to her room. Then she leaves her room and goes out the front door grabbing the mop and bucket for Raffaele. That concludes Amanda’s time in the cottage but there is one more issue: Rudy’s bloody footprints start from Meredith’s room quite noticeable and as they approach the kitchen they get much fainter. Looking at the kitchen footprints it is not unbelievable that she would not notice them if she was not looking for them but the footprints near Meredith’s door were easily noticeable. We have to accept that Amanda did not see these and that she also further managed to completely avoid stepping in them when returning from her shower despite them being pretty much dead center in the narrow hallway.  
  
To recap to accept Amanda’s story we have to believe that a girl came home to find her door open, blood in the bathroom, feces in the toilet, and that she managed to not notice the bloody footprints in the hall, her missing lamp, or the broken window that she would have been directly in front of her at eye level for at least a minute of her walk.  
The version of what happened next is different between Amanda and Raffaele.  
  
According to Amanda she returned to Raffaele’s and cleaned up the mess from the leak and then they had breakfast. While they were having coffee on the veranda she told Raffaele about the strange things at the cottage and they decided to return to investigate. According to Raffaele Amanda appeared at his place mop in hand in a panic about what she had seen. I’m not sure why in his version she didn’t call him instantly and why she still brought the mop but since I don’t believe either of these scenarios actually happened so it doesn’t matter. The main point is that their story diverges in a very significant way. That means they are lying. Amanda either came rushing back in a panic or she came back and cleaned the mess and had breakfast calmly.  
  
Returning to the cottage there are three other strong pieces of evidence that make her look guilty.  
  
**Fake Calling Meredith.**  
  
Filomena asked Amanda to call Meredith because there was concern. Amanda called both of Meredith’s phones but the calls lasted only 3s and 4s and were done just to register the phone activity. Amanda knew no one would answer.  
  
At 12:08pm Amanda calls Filomena and tells her that she saw blood at the cottage. Amanda does not mention the locked door or the burglary. Filomena asks about Meredith and asks Amanda to call Meredith. Amanda one minute earlier at 12:07pm had called Meredith and obviously she did not answer but Amanda does not mention this to Filomena. \[Massei p29, Filomena’s testimony p31, Masseip323\]  
  
At 12:11pm Amanda calls Meredith’s Italian mobile phone for 3 seconds. Amanda than calls Meredith’s English phone and the call lasts 4 second. This would be too short for either phone to go to voice mail. Meredith’s service at the time boosted that their WeAnswer service was the fastest with an average time of 5.5s. Amanda’s previous call to Merdith’s English phone was 16s which would have been the amount of time required to get the voice mail. \[Massei p323\].  
  
Amanda would later claim that when she called Meredith’s Italian phone the phone just rang and rang. Obviously this is not true since the call lasted three seconds.  
  
Quote from Amanda's Email Home, Nov. 4, 2007: ""I *then called the Italian phone and it just kept ringing, no answer.""*

Amanda does not attempt to call Meredith again. This is strange behavior in and of itself but becomes stranger when you consider that in Amanda’s e-mail she claims that before they called the police Sollecito attempted to force open Meredith’s door but failed.

  
Quote from Amanda's Email Home, Nov. 4, 2007: *""I ran outside and down to our neighbors door. the lights were out but i banged ont he door anyway. i wanted to ask them if they had heard anything the night before but no one was home. i ran back into the house. in the living room raffael told me he wanted to see if he could break down merediths door. he tried, and cracked the door, but we couldnt open it. it was then that we decided to call the cops""*

You’d think she would have tried to call Meredith regardless but certainly she would have tried the phone again if any of this actually happened.  
  
**Lying about Meredith Locked Door**  
  
According to Amanda at this point they were really concerned about Meredith.  
  
*""I ran outside and down to our neighbors door. the lights were out but i banged ont he door anyway. i wanted to ask them if they had heard anything the night before but no one was home. i ran back into the house. in the living room raffael told me he wanted to see if he could break down merediths door. he tried, and cracked the door, but we couldnt open it. it was then that we decided to call the cops.*Sollecito tells the police something very similar.  


*He said he went outside “to see if I could climb up to Meredith’s window” but could not. “I tried to force the door but couldn’t, and at that point I decided to call my sister for advice because she is a Carabinieri officer.""*

*A*ccording an interview Amanda’s mom gave CNN Amanda was freaking out about Meredith.  
  
Quote:*E. MELLAS: I got the phone calls about when she came to her house and Amanda kept saying, I've gotten a hold of everybody. I can't get a hold of Meredith. She's not answering her phone. Her door is locked. And you know there was lots of concern.*[*\**](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1105/08/cp.01.html)and likewise in his 112 call to the police Raffaele stress the concern over the locked door and the blood.[\*](http://www.youreporter.it/video_Sollecito_chiama_il_112_telefonata_sottotitolata)  
  
When the postal police arrive though neither Raffaele nor Amanda mention this concern. If you believe their accounts the postal police arrived moments after Raffaele had tried to climb to Meredith’s window and failed to break down her door. The postal police arrive because they have located Meredith’s phone dumped in a yard. It is completely inconceivable that at this point after being in such a panic they would say nothing. For the next thirty minutes no one discusses the locked door or expresses any concern for Meredith.  
  
Not expressing concern for Meredith is already beyond comprehension but the situation gets worse when Amanda lies about Meredith habit of locking her door. When the postal police ask about the door being locked Amanda says that is nothing to be concerned about because Meredith locks her door all the time even to take a shower. Both of the Postal Police Officers as well as Luca, and Marco testified to this and Amanda herself testified that she said it.  
  
Quote from Luca Altieri Testimony Massei p93: ""*I believe it was one of the officers of the postal police that said there was a locked room and Amanda said however that Meredith was in the habit of locking the bedroom even to go to the shower and this reassured us.""*

Both Filomena and Laura would testify that Meredith had never locked her door.\[31\] That the only time Meredith ever locked her door was when she returned to the UK. Why would Amanda lie about Meredith locking her door and even if she honestly believed this was true why would she dissuade the boys and the postal police from opening the door when just 30 minutes earlier Amanda claims that Raffaele was trying to break down the door and climb to Meredith’s window?  
  
**The pre-dawn call to Mom**  
  
Amanda calls her mother at 12:47pm Perugia time which would normally be 3am Seattle time but in this case because of a difference in daylight savings is actually 4am. This call is omitted from Amanda’s e-mail. The police intercepted this conversation between Amanda and her mom.  
  
Quote:***Edda (surprised):*** *But you called me three times.*  
  
***Amanda:*** *Oh, I don’t remember that.*  
  
***Edda:*** *Okay, you called me first to tell me about some things that had shocked you. But this happened before anything really happened in the house.*  
  
***Amanda:*** *I know I was making calls. I remember calling Filomena, but I really don’t remember calling anyone else. I just don’t remember having called you.*  
  
***Edda:*** *Why would that be? Stress, you think?*  
  
***Amanda:*** *Maybe because so many things were happening at once.*  
  
***Edda:*** *Okay, right.*After this conversation Edda changes her version of events. Originally she had told police a version of this phone call that was like the version she told CNN. Now Edda basically claims that during the phone call Amanda said exactly what her e-mail says. The call was 88 seconds and the prosecution knows the mother is lying. They make that clear to the jury by asking Edda if she is sure that is what Amanda said and then implying that it was a lot of information for 88 seconds.

***Amanda:*** *The first time was right away after they had sent us out of the house. I was like this. I sat on the ground, and I called my mother.*  
  
***Comodi:*** *So this was when either the police or the carabinieri had already intervened.*  
  
***Amanda:*** *It was after they had broken down the door and sent us outside. I don’t know what kind of police it was, but it was the ones who arrived first. Later, many other people arrived.*  
  
***Comodi:*** *But from the records, we see that you called your mother – not only from the billing records but also from the cell phone pings – that you first called your mother at twelve. At midday. What time is it at midday? What time is it in Seattle, if in Perugia it is midday?*  
  
***Amanda:*** *In Seattle it’s morning. It’s a nine hour difference, so, ah, three in the morning.*  
  
***Comodi:*** *Three o’clock in the morning?*

***Comodi:*** *So your mother would certainly have been sleeping.*  
  
***Amanda:*** *Yes.*  
  
***Comodi:*** *But at twelve o’clock, nothing had happened yet. That’s what your mother said…*  
  
***Amanda:*** *I told my mother…*  
  
***Comodi:*** *…during the conversation you had with her in prison. Even your mother was amazed that you called her at midday, which was three or four o’clock in the morning in Seattle, to tell her that nothing had happened.*  
  
***Amanda:*** *I didn’t know what had happened. I just called my mother to say that \[the police\] had sent us out of the house, and that I had heard something said about…*  
*Comodi: But at midday nothing had happened yet in the sense that the door had not been broken down yet.*  
  
***Amanda:*** *Hm. Okay. I don’t remember that phone call. I remember that I called her to tell her what we had heard about a foot. Maybe I did call before, but I don’t remember it.*  
  
***Comodi:*** *But if you called her before, why did you do it?*  
  
***Amanda:*** *I don’t remember, but if I did it, I would have called to…*

*In the Italian system the judges can ask questions and so Massei interjects here*  
  
***Massei:*** *Excuse me. You might not remember it, but the Public Minister \[prosecutor\] has just pointed out to you a phone call that your mother received in the small hours.*  
  
***Commodi:*** *At three o’clock in the morning.*  
  
***Massei:*** *So, that must be true. That did happen. Were you in the habit of calling her at such an hour? Did you do this on other occasions? At midday in Italy, which corresponds in Seattle to a time when… It’s just that we don’t usually call each other in the middle of the night.*  
  
***Amanda:*** *Yes, yes, that’s true.*  
  
***Massei:*** *So either you had a particular reason on that occasion, or else it was a routine. This is what the Public Minister is referring to.*  
  
***Amanda:*** *Yes. Well, since I don’t remember this phone call, although I do remember the one I made later, ah. But. Obviously I made that phone call. So, if I made that phone call, it’s because I had, or thought that I had, something I had to tell her. Maybe I thought even then that there was something strange, because at that moment, when I’d gone to Raffaele’s place, I did think there was something strange, but I didn’t know what to think. But I really don’t remember this phone call, so I can’t say for sure why. But I suppose it was because I came home and the door was open, and so for me.*Trying to evade answering this question didn’t serve Amanda well. Her performance on the stand was very weak and left an unfavourable impression with the jury. She has never explained why she called her mother at 3am and yet expressed no concern to the postal police when they just showed up.  
  
**Calling the Police after the Postal Police had already arrived.**  
  
Raffaele makes two calls to 112 (911). The first is at 12:51pm and the second one is at 12:54pm. The postal police claim that they arrived at about 12:30pm. On March 13 2009 Police inspector Mauro Barbadori testified that the CCTV for the parking lot near the cottage captured a black Fiat Punto arriving at the 12:25pm. While this can’t be confirmed to be the postal police it is the same colour and model as their car. The Postal Police notes have them arriving at 12:30pm. At 12:43pm the postal police call Meredith’s UK phone.\[315\] The Postal Police at this point only had Mededith’s Italian mobile phone and that was registered to Filomena. The Postal Police only learn the phone actually belongs to Meredith and that she has a second phone after they speak to Amanda. That they called Meredith’s UK phone 12 minutes before Rafaele called 112 requires that the Postal Police have arrived sufficiently before 12:43pm to speak to Amanda and get the other phone number.  
  
On the internet there was been some argument that the CCTV camera was 30 minutes slow but despite all attempts to find any evidence that this argument was made in court I cannot find any reference to it or to what expert testified that the CCTV camera was slow. This argument is very weak so I suspect it was never actually presented as evidence. Mauro Barbadori testified on March 13th using the CCTV video to establish Meredith arriving home at the correct time the night before and the possible capture of the Postal Police vehicle arriving. If the clock is slow argument was made someone would have needed to testify to that after March 13th and there is no record of it.  
  
Despite the lack of evidence this was ever made I feel it is worth debunking. The argument revolves around the claim that a call to Amanda at 1:29pm was from the police that were lost. The police are then shown arriving at 1:22pm. Based on this Amanda's supporter claim that the CCTV camera had a slow clock. If we accept that the 1:29 call was from lost police how do we know the police who are recorded on the CCTV are also the police that needed directions? The call was from a landline so even if it was the police asking for directions it could have been for other officers since the cottage was soon swarming with them.  
  
While there is no reason to believe the CCTV clock was slow there are many reasons to believe that it was accurate and that Raffaele did call the police after the police had already arrived.  
  
1) Both Officer Battistelli and Officer Marzi remember arriving at about 12:30pm and that is what their notes say. Police officers generally have accurate records.  
  
2) Luca and Marco claim that they arrived before 1pm and before Filomena and Paola who they claim arrived 8-10 minutes after them.  
  
3) Filomena and Paola both claim that they arrived at about 1pm  
  
For the clock to slow argument to be correct all six of these individuals would need to be wrong about what time they arrived at the cottage.  
  
4) The postal police called Meredith’s UK phone at 12:43pm. The only way they could have discovered the Italian phone they had was Meredith’s and not Filomena’s was Amanda. The Postal Police came to the cottage looking for Filomena.  
  
So to accept that the CCTV camera is slow we need to accept that the Wind mobile network is also working with a slow clock.  
  
Further, the account of what happened when the Postal Police arrived is not in dispute by any party. The postal police arrived. Raffaele told them about the burglary and how they were waiting for the police. The postal police explained that they were there because of a hoax and the discovery of Filomena’s phone in a backyard. Amanda explained that the phone actually belonged to Meredith and that she had a second phone. The Postal Police requested that Amanda write down the phone numbers for both phones which she did. They then took a tour of the house were shown the bathroom and Filomena’s room with the staged break-in. Luca and Marco arrive and talk to the Postal Police. Filomena and Poala arrive and talk to the postal police. At this point Officer Battistelli called headquarters.  
  
5) Officer Battistelli calls headquarters to update them on what they had learned and speaks to Officer Bartolozzi who now has Meredith’s UK phone. During this conversation Battistelli mentions Filomena’s arrival and Meredith’s UK phone is turned on. Wind records the phone as active at 1:00pm.  
  
If we are to accept that Raffaele is telling the truth then his call to the police would have ended at 12:55pm. That means that everything described above would have needed to happen in less than 4.5 minutes.  
  
6) Raffaele when confronted with his phone records on November 5th admitted that he called the police after the postal police had already arrived.  
  
I think Raffaele admitting to it was more than enough evidence but I figured I would add the impossibility of getting everything done between when Raffaele ends his call to 112 and the next known timestamp of Meredith’s UK phone being turned on. The truth is that the postal police arrived at 12:30pm. They spoke to the couple outside and then took the tour of the cottage. Around 12:45pm Luca and Marco arrived which gave Amanda and Raffaele the chance to go into Amanda’s room and make a series of phone calls. Filomena and Paola arrive at 1pm and the couple comes out of the bedroom which was witnessed by both Luca and Paola.  
  
**The 122 Call**  
  
The 112 call just sounds suspicious. Raffaele hangs up when he realizes the police officer is suspicious. Raffaele shows a lot of concern for the locked door but says nothing about it to the postal police who if you believe Amanda arrive seconds after this call but in reality the postal police is actually in the cottage as this call is being made. Raffaele also says that nothing was stolen which is odd.

1fzzpld,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1fzzpld/that_one_in_a_million_shot/,That one in a million shot,"A week ago I went to one of those arranged dinners with 5 strangers. It was a pretty good time, the people were nice but I only really felt like I connected with the girl next to me.  She was very sweet and we seemed to have chemistry, but I was in the  process of feeling out what I thought might be a blossoming relationship with someone else, so I didn't ask her for her number.

Another guy at the table asked for everyone's number and said he would put us all in a WhatsApp group together, but it's been a week and I never got added to a group. I didn't exchange numbers with him, only gave him mine, so that meant I had nobody's number and no way to get them.

The relationship with the other person wound up purely platonic, so I was pretty bummed out that I had just let this girl disappear when I wasn't even in an relationship with anyone else.

So last night, I spent about an hour seeing if she was as terminally online as I am. All I knew was her profession and her first name, and they are both quite common in my city.  I Googled her but got a million matches. Then I found a LinkedIn profile that matched and recognized her photo, but it only had 1 connection, so I figured it was probably dormant. But at least now I knew her last name. 

I looked for her on every other social network and she didn't exist. No Instagram, no TikTok, no Facebook. But googling again with her full name showed me where she worked. She's in a health profession, so I thought about just booking an appointment with her, but she also isn't in the popular health booking app here.

She is a total ghost online.

I resolved to just call her office in the morning to see if I could catch her, when I found a single old article from her employer's website that listed a different number for her than the office number - a cell phone.

So I texted the number saying hi it's me and I'm not in the group chat. If that's on purpose, no hard feelings but if not I just wanted to stay in contact with you.

2 hours later she texted me back with her personal number. Apparently the guy who made the group chat messed up my number somehow and she was disappointed to have lost track of me too.

I had worried that I was being stalker-ish, but she thanked me for doing the work to track her down, and immediately asked when I'm free to get a coffee with her.

So that's the one-in-a-million shot. 1/1M I can find her without her full name. 1/1M she has NO online presence at all. 1/1M she isn't weirded out by me tracking her down.

Even crazier is that the one lead I found that got me going was her LinkedIn profile with her photo. There don't appear to be any other photos of her online except one from a decade ago, where I would not have recognized her.  And she literally just created that LinkedIn profile, which is why she has no connections.

I don't know how to feel.  I'm so, so hurt, and I don't know how to function.  It would have been 3 years together in January.  To make matters worse, we live together.  He told me he wants me to stay at our house, and that he will stay at his parents for as long as is necessary.  We had some issues about a year ago, due to my inability to control my emotions.  My now ex partner has commended me many times for all the progress I've made, telling me that's he's very proud of me.  We really have come a long way, and I thought all was well.  But suddenly last night he held me close and told me ""honey, I need to step outside of our relationship.  We have made a lot of progress, but I've realized this relationship has really worn me down.  I want to try again with you in the future, but right now I think we should break up.  I really feel we both have to work on ourselves as individuals.  I feel like the foundation of our relationship is cracked, and we need to start over.""  My first thought was ""this sounds like taking a break, not a break up,"" but they insisted that they consider it a break up, because they want us to both fully focus on ourselves and not worry about each other the way partners would.

They described how it wouldn't be forever, and that they still believe we are meant to be together.  He said he isn't worried because he completely believes we will come back to each other.  He assured me that we will make sure that when we do get back together, we are the best versions of ourselves, to ensure that something like this will never happen again.  He said he still wants me in his life (as a friend for now), that I'm his family, and that his family is my family.  He told me that he would never fall for anyone else, and that he would never see other people, but he understands if I ended up doing that.  He really does love me so much, and I love him so much.  At first I told him there's no way I want to be just friends, and that I don't want to stay in touch very much.  But I gave in very quickly, and agreed that we would still talk.  We even still say ""i love you,"" because it's true, and will never not be true.  But we agreed that I need to heavily limit the reassurance seeking I would engage in when we were together.  In addition to that, he wants us to avoid talking excessively about ""when we get back together,"" because he feels that will keep us from maturing as individuals.  I told him it hurts to see our photos together, and he said it shouldn't hurt, because those were wonderful times, and we will have tons more photos to take when we are partners again.  In the meantime, maybe we will get coffee once in a while, as friends, until we have both grown enough to be partners again.  But who knows how long that will be?  Months?  Years?  What will happen in our personal lives in that time?

I'm deeply afraid that maybe they aren't being honest, maybe they will end up with someone else, but he's never ever lied to me before, and he seems so authentic in his assurance that he will not be with other people.  I'm scared that I won't be able to get better, and that when we get back together, I will inevitably repeat my old patterns of being overbearing, demanding, and jealous.  I don't want to be away from them, I really really don't.  But deep down I know that I need to experience what it's like to not be in a relationship.  I got with them very shortly after ending things with my abuser.  Our first months/years together were beautiful, but highly volatile and full of arguing (mostly from me).  Even though arguments aren't nearly as common now, the unhealthy nature of our relationship in the beginning has made any sort of argument or episode very triggering to them.  He says he feels safe with ME, but he feels that the relationship is so unpredictable that he doesn't have a lot of peace.  I understand why.  I am codependent on them, and maybe there is no other way to change that except being apart.

I don't know, this is kind of a vent.  But also I want reassurance.  I made myself a list of reassurances, based on the conversations I've had with him about where we go from here.  It's just really hard to believe and process.  Am I being stupid and naive?  Or am I overreacting, and should I just let this pass?  I'm so focused on him and how scared I am of him changing his mind about me that I don't even know how to begin focusing on myself, and bettering myself.  I've been in therapy for so long, but ever since being with him it's largely been focused on how to fix my relationships.

1fzznhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WatcherSnark/comments/1fzznhv/steven_and_tipping_a_play_by_play/,steven and tipping: a play by play,"**EDIT:** Should have specified, this is a recounting of a portion of a PodWatcher episode. I briefly mentioned it in another post and people asked about it. **END EDIT**

Steven announces his topic and there's an air of discomfort in the room immediately. Ryan says ""oh boy"" and Shane looks tense. They ramble on about something else for a minute, perhaps delaying the inevitable.

When Steven gets them back on track, he starts by saying that he's worked in the service/food industry before. Then he starts bragging about a recent trip to Korea. He didn't ""spend a cent"" on tipping there because it's culturally frowned upon, but emphasizes how good the service was. The way he goes about saying this makes me uneasy for some reason. There seems to be some unspoken implications. There's a small dialogue about cultural differences re: tipping.

They switch gears and get a little deeper into it. Steven says tipping culture is broken in America. Shane makes a good point, blaming the system for putting the burden on customers to pay employees rather than the businesses themselves; Steven agrees. He then asks how much Ryan and Shane tip for a cup of coffee. They reply, ""A buck or two."" Steven's response: ""But *should* you be tipping a buck or two?"" and then goes on to say that it would be much better to just be able to pay the amount due.

Shane brings up that different experiences require different types of tips; what's required for a barista is different than what would be required for a restaurant. Ryan says this might be part of the problem. Steven gets a bit more animated as he agrees, saying there is ""no clarity or consistency"" and that there is a ""lack of communication"" resulting in ""disappointment.""

Ryan says he doesn't understand why a fast food worker is considered less worthy of tips than other types of restaurant servers, highlighting the inconsistency aspect. Then he mentions going to a fast food restaurant where tips were allowed (?), and mentions getting ""anxious"" trying to choose an option on the touchpad.

Steven gets very aggravated at the mention of the touch pad. ""Tipping culture was already weird, and then it's evolved in the way that's made it worse. Now you have the iPad, with the, 'You wanna tip 30%, 40%, or 50%? They're out of control!""

Shane, who has been quiet for a bit, pipes up, laughing a bit: ""I don't know that I've seen 50%.""

Steven starts talking over him and waving his hands a bit, conceding he was exaggerating but swearing that he's seen the lowest at 20% before (probably true, LA has lots of upscale spots he likely frequents), as Shane spells out the standard offerings of 15%, 20%, and 25%.

Shane has a meeting to get to. He looks relieved, yet a bit awkward, to be leaving.

Steven gets right back into complaining about the ""expectations"" and that the ""rules are being made up as we go."" Ryan brings up his anxiety over wanting to be a good person and tip the proper amount, but not really knowing the rules from place to place. Steven drily says ""for sure."" He then goes onto say that most people don't tip hotel housekeepers even though you're supposed to. He claims that tipping is ""driven by awkwardness, by obligation, by face-to-face contact, which doesn't seem right either.""

Ryan approaches this generously, mentions that it doesn't seem fair that only the people you see face-to-face are getting their allotment of tips at hotels.

Steven says this is ""so strange,"" and then starts talking about his trip to Korea again. It is clarified that this trip was for his food show, and then he starts talking about the service again. ""The service there was incredible."" He observes that it's ""a team effort, not an individual effort"" and that everyone was working together to get him whatever he wanted as quickly as possible. He appears to believe this is not the case in America.

""It's weird that certain industries get shafted,"" Ryan says. Steven is staring blankly but says he agrees, albeit only after the producer says so first.

Steven says there should be a set standard for tipping. ""There's no consistency.""

There's a small dialogue about jobs that don't normally get tipped. Grocery stores are mentioned; the producer says he received tips when he worked at a grocery store, despite not being technically being allowed to. He would refuse first, then accept if the customer insisted. For some reason Steven looks annoyed.

Steven mentions that the people in the back of the restaurant he worked at did not get tips. The other two seem a bit surprised by this. (It is my understanding - based on experience - that it depends on the establishment's policy on how tips are divided, which serves the inconsistency argument.) They all agree that this is unfair.

Steven mentions that he gets mad when ""gratuity included"" establishments include an option for extra tipping on the receipt. He appears disgusted by the idea of tipping any more than he has to: ""And then you *double tip*."" Ryan puts another generous spin on this, saying he gets annoyed when it's unclear exactly how much of the ""gratuity included"" bill is actually going to the server, because if it's an absurdly low amount he'd like to be able to tip more, but finds it difficult to do the deconstructive math.

Steven looks uncomfortable and annoyed as Ryan mentions thinking ""gratuity included"" bills often don't include enough of a tip.

The producer mentions this is part of a wider problem, joining it together with the fact that nobody's getting enough money overall: ""People have to set up GoFundMes to pay their medical bills.""

They move on to the next subject.

So, final thoughts as somebody who worked in the service industry for a long time: A lot of good points are made, blaming the failings of the system rather than the individual, but there's a running theme throughout where Steven, a wealthy, educated CEO of a Los Angeles entertainment startup, seems very disdainful that he has to tip anyone at all. Most of his more generous takes throughout the conversation are led (or twisted into something more digestible) by his cohosts. Lots of outright complaining on his end rather than thoughtful discussion.

I agree that the system is broken. I also think that it's unfair to put the burden of paying the employee on the customer rather than the business. Ideally, everyone would be making a living wage and tips would just be a nice little bonus. But that's not the world we live in, and I don't think Steven Lim is going out of his way to help make that world.

Besides, at the end of the day, tips *are* optional. They are strongly encouraged. The employee hopes you will, because yes, like or not, that tip might be the only way *they* can eat that day. But Steven can always hit the ""no tip"" option. He can always leave that line on the receipt blank. Nobody is holding him at gunpoint and making him give his barista a dollar, and it comes off very tone deaf to be complaining about it.

Also, maybe it's just me, but when I tip it's not ""driven by awkwardness, by obligation, by face-to-face contact."" Everything is case-by-case, of course; there *can* be awkwardness, there *can* be a vibe. Maybe to some degree I feel obligated, but I don't think that obligation has the same connotations his does. I find it very telling that he frames the very concept of tipping as elaborate coercion, brought about by being forced to look the help in the eye.

Also, I don't doubt the service in Korea was wonderful. I'm sure it was! I believe everything he says about that. I also know that a *literal show being filmed* probably secured a certain amount of special attention from staff. And I don't really appreciate the bizarre implications he was bringing to the table, between the 'well *they* had amazing service and didn't even *want* a tip, unlike *here* where everything is *worse* and I *have* to' vibes and the absolutely puzzling 'restaurants are not a team effort in America' sentiment. I don't even know where he got that one from. It reminds me of those semester abroad people who come back acting like they've been enlightened by the cultural differences they witnessed (and half those differences are just the same).",12,1728501566.0,WatcherSnark,12,0.75,False

1fzzmh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1fzzmh8/is_it_better_to_quit_cold_turkey_or_gradually/,Is It Better to Quit Cold Turkey or Gradually?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been struggling with derealization/depersonalization (DR/DP) syndrome, and I suspect my caffeine intake might be playing a role in triggering or worsening my symptoms. I’ve been drinking coffee since I was 16, but my DR/DP started about two years ago, when I was 23. I usually drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day, so it’s not a huge amount. However, I’ve read that caffeine can potentially exacerbate DR/DP episodes.

I’ve tried going without coffee for 2-3 days at a time, but I haven’t noticed any significant changes in my symptoms, which makes it easy for me to fall back into the habit since I genuinely enjoy coffee.

Here’s my question: I want to reduce my caffeine intake, but I’m not sure which approach is better. Should I cut back gradually, say by reducing to one cup a day, then one cup every two days, and taper off completely over the course of a month? Or would it be better to just quit cold turkey?

On days when I skip my usual cup of coffee, I do feel a strong craving, so I think I might be experiencing some mild withdrawal symptoms. Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!",2,1728501494.0,decaf,6,1.0,False

Given the hype around this coffee is pretty much settled I wanted to see if I can ask a few questions on rest times and brew recipes.

First, I can't really find a consensus anywhere on when the peak of this bean is. Some people are saying 3-4 weeks others are saying this needs around 6-8 weeks of rest because it’s ultra light. On one of Brian Quan's livestreams he states the latter for filter roasts done by the likes of Apollen's and Manhattan. I'm currently mid way through week 3 of resting and only have a 125g bag so I'm trying not to waste or experiment too heavily on any it. Can anyone share their experiences on this coffee and rest times so I can better figure out if I should brew now or rest another few weeks?

Second, has anyone tried a hybrid or full immersion recipe on this? I usually default to Lance's 1-2-1 brew but I've also enjoyed hybrid brews from Coffee Chronicles' Switch Recipe and Emi Fukahori’s [Switch Recipe](https://europeancoffeetrip.com/easy-hario-switch-recipe-emi-fukahor/). I’m curious to know if anyone got good clarity and the super fun aromas that this coffee is known to have with hybrid or a full immersion brew on the Switch.

  
thanks in advance guys. I’m very excited for this! If i can dial this in we’ll, I’m thinking of buying some more and brewing it for my parents this Christmas. I’ve heard this is the coffee to blow a non-coffee nerd‘s mind.",1,1728501463.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Its long story ,"2-3 weeks ago my two year relationship ended. Out of the blue at least for me. When she called telling me she wanted to break up, she also told me that the guy I was skeptical of at her new job liked her and confessed his feelings. She told me she liked him too. So I tried my best to be a man and let her go, telling her I respect her wishes and I wish her the best but also told her I wanted to break up in person. Inside I was screaming, I felt betrayed, I felt as if this one person who was my rock turned into my kryptonite. I got Hom and I cried. She promised me that she wasn't breaking up with me because of him and it was because we were in a toxic cycle of promising to change and not changing, said that I made her feel uncomfortable.

On one hand I believed her, because in my head I knew her and she wouldn't lie to me on the other hand it was kind of hard to believe with the way events turned out. But for 3 days I would talk highly of her I'd say she was amazing, and strong and honest and blah blah blah and tbh I still do think she's strong and independent. My mum and some friends told me straight that if I want to get over it I have to stop looking at it through rainbow glasses and I need to look at it for what it is. I was worried about tainting the image I had of her, but I looked at it as a whole and the more I thought about it looked back on it I realised it was toxic and she cheated on me not physically but emotionally. 

On the 4th day of the break up I met her at Costa for coffee and to break up in person, talk about what happened. She said that she didn't have time; she just started her apprenticeship and I was in full-time college, our schedules never really aligned. To be honest I thought that was bullshit I last saw her 7th of September it's now September 15th and we had plans to meet up more, after college or after her work., the point is I told her and was ready to commit to making an effort seeing her every week. She wasn't ready to make that commitment. She told me that we'd promised to change and and never did and although yes that's true. I realised that you don't need to change for your partner nay you shouldn't have to, and that when you're in a relationship you understand eachothers needs and through that you catere and adapt but you shouldn't have to change yourself for your partner. She said I was immature, and I told her that we're both really young I'm 18 she's 17 and this is our first mature relationship ofc we're going to be immature but that's how we grow. Her example was why I wanted to go university and that was for the uni life which isn't immature it's normal for an 18 year old. 

In the relationship she wasn't very catering and toxic. What I mean by is when in that relationship I was an overthinker I wasn't insecure but I would overthink what she says and how she said it. Over time I got used to the way she'd talk and how she spoke and text and when that habit broke it raised flags for me that something was wrong, but everytime I bring this up shed shoot it down telling me I'm overthinking and people change and that I need to ""be a man and grow up"" I let this go on for a while but she never acknowledged I was an overthinker nor did she help it put it to rest. She was hard to read I knew shed love me by the dates we went on and her telling me everyday and the big gifts and her actions but her words were very rude and cold and mean. She'd bring up past arguments to guilt me into saying sorry over and over and over. On my birthday she gave me a suicide note, I sat on that floor all night till 5am crying because she wouldn't answer her phone I thought she killed herself. I couldn't get to her, so I called the ambulance. She text me that morning saying she's sorry. Literally that the only word she said was sorry. Found out she was feeling a little down. She did that 3 times after. In this relationship I wasn't a saint. I did some things wrong. I forgot her first interview which she held me to. Whilst at home she felt uncomfortable with what I was doing, I was kissing her not just ont he lips and I asked her multiple times if what it was doing was okay she said yes, she never said no and she didn't look like anything was wrong. But then she looked like she wasn't enjoying it and I asked what's wrong she said nothing. I could sense there was something wrong so I stopped she then said I took advantage of her and bring it up all the time I felt terrible.

Fast forward 3 weeks I've been doing a lot better getting past it and I think what helped me the most was knowing that I love myself. Before hand I loved myself but after we broke up it was like ""if I don't have her what am I?"". The answer to that is your you and you need to love yourself for who you are helped me massively, I then got a haircut shaved my beard after 5 months and I changed my fashion sense I also made it an effort to have an academical comeback. It gave me a sense of change a sense of purpose; talking to people about it helped a lot too. I then got a message from her saying she missed me. 

I beat around the bush but she wasn't getting the hint so I asked her bluntly why she missed me. Said "" she misses having someone to talk to, misses having the one person who knows her through and through"". That's when I snapped. 

""What do you mean you miss, this is what you wanted, you asked for this."" 
I asked her, why she text me, she didn't answer me she asked me why I missed her and I poured my heart out. Basically said she was my everything and I missed the person I wanted a life with. Told her that she broke me and asked what she wanted out of texting me. I really thought she was the one, i limited my career for her (which is my fault), I thought I had one the lottery in terms of people I was the happiest and proudest mf to roam the earth with her.

The point I want to make is, those of you who just lost the person you thought made you completely, it's like they ripped apart of you and ran away but I want you to remember this when you miss her. What else do you have going for you? Probably a lot, you've got your job if it ain't the job of your dreams but at least you got one, your roof over your head, your food. Your living on planet earth for god sake, we may not be the only species out there but as far as we know we're the only ones in the milky way, live your life to your fullest potential. 

There was a tree in the forest and one day a lumberjack came and chopped it's branch down. The tree had a choice there and then. It could either focus on the branch it lost and let it wither the tree away or focus on all it's other branches that make it a tree. The tree chose to focus on the other branches and it eventually grew back that branch and became whole again. The choice is yours you beautiful handsome/gorgeous people.

For some context I started using kratom powder about 4 months ago and slowly transitioned to extracts and eventually to 7oh. I’ve now been on 7oh for two months and have been able to maintain a daily dosage of about 50mg. I actively force myself to not go above 60mg in a day and for the most part it hasn’t been too hard. I see all the horror stories about 7oh and how it is almost impossible to quit and the high becomes less and less over time forcing you to use absurd amounts. I’ve read WDs can be crazy and I myself have began to experience WDs at night waking up at 2am feeling uncomfortable. I’ve had some success combating this with magnesium and melatonin every night before bed. I find 7oh is actually very useful, it helps me to focus for work and gets me over the lack of sleep from taking care of a 6month old baby. It gives me increased energy when I need it and helps reduce anxiety. I’m still active when I’m on it and have found it has helped me with my relationships with others. I speak more about my feelings and am overall more communicative when I’m on it. The thing I hate is that I am now dependent on it. I would like to hear if anyone has any good experiences either getting off of 7oh at this level of usage or being able to maintain this type of usage for an extended period of time. My goal would be to get to a point where I can use it when needed similar to how I use coffee to wake up or give me a boost in the middle of a long day and then be able to skip a few days here and there. Am I foolish for thinking this is possible? Should I just bite the bullet and quit before I get too deep? Any input would be appreciated!

Hundreds of years before the start of the series, before the existence of a transnational communications system, when Kingdoms as we know them today were only starting to be established, Remnant was a more dangerous place for mankind in many ways. Back in the day, brute strength was required to survive, and many weaker men would be plucked out of the gene pool, allowing mankind to grow ever stronger and recently, more intelligent. 300 years before present, it wasn't unusual to see Huntsmen who were absolutely huge, up to 8 feet tall in many cases, and bearing such gigantic, carved muscles that many of them would make Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Jerry Lewis. Their bodies were adapted to build muscle mass very easily and maintain their inflated mass with minimal effort. These men quite literally resembled Gods. Legends persist of how they would take down gargantuan (for the time) Grimm by themselves, and there are rumors that some would use their bare hands to dispatch them. Individual Huntsmen are remembered through public art, statues and frescoes, adorning the Kingdoms and smaller towns they singlehandedly protected in the infancy of these settlements, and the Huntsmen Academies of today often have dedicated monuments, and name their accolades as tribute to a few of the greatest heroes to inhabit their kingdoms.

Today, people of such might are much more scarce, thanks to Remnant becoming a more technologically advanced and overall safer place to live, which allows for the meek to survive and reproduce. More importantly, weapon technology has improved and the nature of aura has been better understood by the academies. Since getting a huntsman license in the modern age doesn't require you to reach such an enormous size and strength, this has allowed far more men, and a large number of women brave enough to take the challenge, to enroll themselves as defenders of mankind. However, this does come at a cost. Individual huntsmen and huntresses would probably be significantly weaker compared to the ones of bygone days, especially as new forms of Grimm appear, each new variety posing an escalating danger to mankind. This is why huntsmen are now commonly organised in teams in order to counter the threat. Today, you may occasionally find very tall men and women in Remnant, these individuals who are also very robustly built and muscular in addition to their heights, yes, even the women, are descendants of these mighty men who once guarded Humanity from extinction.

2. Fauna of Remnant

Compared to Earth, the environment of Remnant has been developed far less by human activity, thanks to the threat of Grimm. Therefore, there is a far greater degree of biodiversity in the more pristine landscapes of Remnant, and this means more animals, many of which are weirder than what you can imagine living on Earth today, such as horned Giraffe/Moose lookalikes, four tusked Elephants, Antelopes with trunks, Turtles with giant horns, polar Rhinoceros and Camel species, giant Ducks etc. somewhat reminiscent of Ice Age Earth. Because of this, mankind doesn't just have Grimm to watch out for when walking through the forest, they also have to be wary of whatever undiscovered predators might be lurking around. In addition, the wildlife doesn't have a great fear of mankind as you would see on Earth, as Humans haven't been able to pose any substantial threat to many of these species, therefore, a lot of them have a far more docile and tame behavior, especially if their habitats have no natural predators, such as in islands or isolated mountains.

I must mention, a lot of this does depend on how large the land area of Remnant is, as this would naturally give rise to a greater variety in animals. And it also depends on how the God of Light repopulated Remnant, whether it be through the Adam and Eve way, dropping a hundred Adams and Eves on Remnant or allowing humanity to evolve from monkeys.

3. High Society of Atlas

Atlas, the most technologically advanced city in Remnant, has developed it's own unique culture distinct from the rest of Remnant, thanks to it's bloody beginnings and modern affluence. Human colonization of Solitas was completed through 3 waves of migration, the first two barely survived the sub-zero temperatures and the lack of available food, but the hardened survivors were crucial to the success of the third wave in establishing the first permanent settlement, known as Mantle, their descendants still inhabit the historic old town on the floating city. Despite the first couple of decades being characterized by mass die-offs, the settlement quickly became the epicenter of pioneering technology and innovation while developing a very militaristic culture, seeking to colonize other parts of Remnant, all of these factors ensured that the kingdom emerged from the Great War as the world superpower. Coupled with the energy boom through mining dust and technology associated, the Atlesians have managed to make themselves incredibly wealthy, having built a near perfect, high trust society for themselves above the industrial sprawl of Mantle.

In contrast to their ancestors, the average Atlesian elite is rather slightly built, usually with not much in terms of muscle mass as they've eliminated the use for it. Most Atlesian men are very well educated, showcasing their great intellect (the most prized virtue in the modern kingdom) in their manner of speech, and they have a talent when it comes to charisma and friendliness. It's very easy for these young men to get themselves high paying jobs, even easier if your father owns the company you're trying to break into or runs a dust quarry, these jobs demand little in terms of labor and allow them to enjoy their free time at high-end restaurants, cocktail bars and parties with their co-workers. The women also have an easy time in life compared to those in other parts of Remnant, without the need to do menial work, they are allowed to pursue their creative hobbies, art, music, entertainment etc. and capitalize on them, groups of these socialites are a very common sight in the streets, department stores and cafes of the grand city and they also have a culture where they are expected to be exceedingly friendly, kind and generous to those around them. The wealthy, comfortable, stress-free lifestyle of young Atlesian elites has also made them rather eccentric, and somewhat child-like in their idealism, in contrast to the more pessimistic and jaded attitudes of some of the inhabitants in other parts of Remnant. They usually marry and start families young, which is easy when everybody in Atlas is a family friend of each other, and they tend to age very well, a mix of their natural beauty, healthy diets and care for their bodies, this is why you see a lot of girls travel to Atlas in search for some cute, rich boys.

Atlas is not only the center of defense technology and finance, it also has a vibrant theatrical scene, producing popular and acclaimed musicals and launching the careers of aspiring stars worldwide. The musical scene of Atlas is incredibly lively, the prevailing genre being Big Band music which is very important in the lives of Atlesians. It's also well known for the grandiose architecture that comes out of the city, often considered the most beautiful in Remnant (with Mistral not far behind) along with the Atlesians themselves. And finally, since Atlas is a highly intellectual society, there is a vibrant philosophical movement in the city, residents would often flock to coffee houses and libraries to hear the debates between the great minds about human behavior, the best economic and social models to follow and more.

1fzze2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HatsuVault/comments/1fzze2z/round_1_match_3_jack_puncher_vs_auntin_rend/,[Round 1] - Match #3: Jack Puncher vs. Auntin Rend,"It was a grueling battle, but in the end Atley's....weakened state, made this a pretty simple match up for Arthur, and a result it only took a good plan to throw Atley into a haze, allowing Arthur to capitalize on Atley's senses, and end the fight faster than Atley's baked ass fuck brain could even process.

**Winner:** Arthur Hix

Arthur gets to move on to the 2nd Round of the tournament, and now the two contenders stepping into the arena for the second match is Jack Puncher and Auntin Rend, two fighters with two contrasting fighting styles, but before we get into the voting, let's break down these fighters and their abilities, seeing as it’s up to Y'ALL to decide who wins!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jack Puncher, a curious professional Hunter who wants to discover new places and creatures, and is filled with a wonder of nature, which makes Jack quite the  adventurer, and when added to his explorish and wanderer nature, he's unpredictable, and it's because of this that Jack is too impatient to sit around in one place for too long, as he relies on his instincts and takes the day as it comes, and always has a knack for fighting with his fists, which is what led him into training in many martial arts, viewing fights as sort of a chess match, trying to outsmart his opponents, and although he is not afraid to take risks and in fact do so on the regular, he can be reckless, but his ability to think quick on his feet, as well as his strong and fast body, usually gets him out of most troubles. Other than that though, he relies on his physicality to win fights and fights in close quarters, as he can use his support abilities to close the gap, usually trying to get close and stay close, but it's due to Jack's reliance on close-quarters combat and physicality that makes him quite vulnerable to ranged attacks and opponents who can maintain a distance, and due to his reckless nature, it can often lead him into precarious situations, which can sometimes result in severe consequences if he overestimates his abilities or underestimates his opponents, and while his physical strength is formidable, his speed and aura control are less developed, potentially leaving him at a disadvantage against more versatile or faster opponents.

|Strategy & IQ (2/5)|Physical Strength (5/5)|Speed (2/5)|Aura Control (3/5)|Endurance (4/5)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|While Jack is not stupid, he relies more on instinct than careful planning, which are sharp and often guide him in combat, as his understanding of fights is deeply rooted in experience and muscle memory rather than intellectual analysis.|Due to Jack's extensive martial arts training and rigorous physical regimen, he's as strong as they come, and can dish out devastating blows with incredible force, breaking through defenses and overwhelming opponents in close-quarters combat, as his strikes are not just powerful, but precise, targeting weak spots to maximize damage.|Although Jack isn't slow, he's not particularly fast, as his movements are more deliberate and measured, which helps him make the most of his power and precision, as he focuses on maximizing the impact of each strike rather than moving quickly.|Jack has pretty good aura control, able to perform basic Nen techniques effectively, but he's no master unfortunately, as his aura usage is heavily geared toward enhancing his physical abilities, meaning he sometimes lacks the finesse needed for more nuanced aura manipulation.|Jack is no marathon runner, and that's simply because he gets stronger the longer the fight goes on, which allows him to outlast opponents in prolonged battles, similar to the MMA fighter, Nate Diaz.|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And to complement Jack's relentless fighting spirit, his Hatsu abilities are tailored to enhance his instinctual combat style:

* **Combo Master (Enhancement + Emission):** When a strike is landed on the enemy, the combo counter goes up. For each number in the counter, the next strikes power is stronger 10%, although the counter is capped at 15, and at combo count 15, Jack would enter the ""Free Flow"" state, where all his Nen enhancement is increased overall, making him faster and stronger, with his reaction time and thinking speed being the most enhanced attribute, in order to avoid getting hit. This is important, because of the conditions of the ability, which consist of conditions like how if Jack is hit during the combo, then the combo would reset to 0, this changes to being hit twice to interrupt the combo during ""Free Flow"". Not to mention the strikes Jack lands must be from his body, and the strikes must be clean hits, blocked blows and glancing blows will not count. Finally the counter depletes on it's own with time, so if no strike is landed for 10 seconds, then the combo resets from 0. Other than that, here's the ""finishers"" Jack can perform, which depletes the counter, as the strength of the finisher depends on the amount in the counter. The first one being ""Final Blow,"" which depletes the combo counter and enforces Jack's next strike with a LOT of aura, hopefully finishing his opponent. This can be a punch or a kick or even a headbutt. It really doesn't matter, but he has to declare it's the final blow. The second one being ""Force,"" which depletes the counter and emits force all around him, pushing people/objects away from him. Although he must declare ""Force"" when he uses the finisher, and the last one being ""Slam,"" which depletes the counter while grabbing someone, and throws them into the ground. Although Jack must declare ""Slam"" to use this finisher.
* **Recovery Master (Enhancement):** This ability only activates when Jack sleeps, requiring no conscious effort, but this ability enhances healing and recovery within the body, so when Jack wakes up, he feels more refreshed, and his wounds will have healed much more quickly. However, this won't activate if Jack's aura is depleted.
* **Tag Master (Emission + Conjuration):** When Jack touches something with his palm and says ""Tag,"" a symbol is conjured on that person. This can be anything, like an object or a creature, and the tagged object or creature can switch place with either Jack, or another tagged object when he says ""switch"". Although what is swapped is determined by Jack's intention. The downside however is that Jack can only have up to 10 tags in total, and whenever he switches, there's usually a 5 second cooldown period. Not to mention Jack must be within 1000 meters of the tag, making this quite the strategic tool.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auntin Rend, a reclusive individual with an eccentric personality, he enjoyed the thrill of battle and had even  become known for his sharp skills , but after an accident with his Nen ability, Auntin had abandoned all attachment to excitement and adopted a much more grim, stoic demeanor, which is ironically similar to the cowboys from old movies that he was inspired by when he developed his abilities, as Auntin seeks redemption in some unspoken way, but has still fallen to a lower partition of society due to his work, using his abilities to overwhelm enemies and striking fear into them, as he holds his range and uses his six-shooter, and although he finds less enjoyment in fighting then he used to, he still does get a small thrill when he lands a trick shot with his gun, but due to the tragedy of his past, the joy he once found in fighting has largely faded, and was mostly just replaced by a relentless pursuit of survival and penance. However, Auntin's greatest personal weakness is the mental block that forces himself to stop his Hatsu right before the point of lethality, and will only kill with his gun, and it's because of this that he struggles with finishing his enemies quickly, meaning that while Auntin can induce immense fear, he will only kill using his gun, and it's due to this self-imposed limitation that it often makes him hesitate in combat, especially when the use of his abilities could lead to unintended fatalities. Not to mention Auntin's reliance on his Nen abilities for survival has made him more dependent on them than he would like to admit.

|Strategy & IQ (5/5)|Physical Strength (2/5)|Speed (4/5)|Aura Control (3/5)|Endurance (3/5)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Auntin relies heavily on strategy during combat, leveraging his enemies' confusion and fear to control the battlefield, as he is highly adaptive, thinking several steps ahead, and thrives on misdirection, as well as psychological warfare.|He has a slim build and is poor at hand to hand combat against large enemies, especially when in his normal state. However, when he has his second Nen ability active, his acute senses give him a large advantage, as his reaction time increases to double that of his opponent.|Although Auntin isn't the fastest Hunter around, where he's most fast at is in close-quarters precision and quick draws, and that's simply because he relies on his speed to maintain range, but when it increases, due to his second ability, he uses his speed to rapidly flicker between close and mid-range combat, using rapid point-blank shots to destroy his enemy.|Auntin is quite gifted in Shu for a non-Manipulator, which enhances his bullets and weaponry, giving him a significant advantage in combat, but beyond that he is average with his aura control.|Auntin enjoys long fights, as they are important to his strategy and because of this, he has tried to become accustomed to them, but other than that he's not particularly known for high stamina, relying more on bursts of intensity.|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to his grim demeanor, Auntin’s Hatsu abilities also reflect his tumultuous relationship:

* **Nigh Dead Dust (Transmutation + Emission):** His aura sheds from himself, sitting in the air till someone breathes it in. Once someone breathes it in, their heart rate and blood pressure slowly increases, causing fear to strike them no matter their conviction. The dust would then look like what you would see in a wild west movie, winding through the air in a large slow twister, kind of like matter, with Auntin being the eye of it. Not to mention this ""dust"" is adrenaline in a breathable form, so after an hour, anyone under the effect of the dust would start to die, as their heart gives out. This ability was created to amp up the battlefield, but after Auntin accidentally killed twenty-six people, both enemies and allies, he forced himself into nomadism and eventually became a hitman.
* **Dead Eye (Transmutation + Emission + Enhancement):** Auntin enhances their heart, arteries, and ability to process adrenaline, increasing their senses acutely, while also increasing the adrenaline like effects on their physical body. This ability used to have a much cruder form that was created for the sake of survival, but is now much more developed for the sake of monopolizing on his main ability. This would increase his strength, speed, and endurance by one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Host's Thoughts:**

So imma keep it a buck 50 y'all, and it's probably because I just woke up as i'm writing this, but between these two contestants....i'm at a loss here, cuz between Jack and Auntin, both fighters bring their unique styles and strategies to the forefront, shaping the flow of battle in fascinating ways, and although I think Jack is strong as all hell, I do think impulsive and unpredictable nature could lead him into risky situations, since Jack's close-quarters combat style is built around his physical prowess, and a result, Auntin could easily exploit that. However, it also makes him a formidable opponent in melee, relying on instinct and quick reflexes to outmaneuver his enemies, and with something strong like Jack's Combo Master Hatsu, it could most certainly turn the tide of battle, since it enhances his combat effectiveness by increasing the power of successive strikes, allowing him to reach a heightened state of speed and strength in his ""Free Flow"" state, but in contrast to this, Auntin could also take advantage of Jack’s impulsiveness if Jack isn't careful, cuz although Jack is physically strong, Auntin would present a stark contrast to Jack, as his Hatsu abilities reflect this turmoil, particularly Nigh Dead Dust, which allows him to manipulate a dust-like aura that induces fear and physiological strain on his opponents, as this ability can incapacitate enemies over time, and since this is a tournament and murder is off the table, I do think it's unlikely that Auntin's mental block would take effect, so really this fight is just a classic case of ""Brawn vs Brain,"" as I personally believe that although Auntin's smart, it is a possibility that Jack's power could overpower such smarts. Conversely though, since Auntin's arguably smarter, as his combat style revolves around maintaining distance while inflicting psychological and physical pressure on his opponents through his Nigh Dead Dust, Auntin could gradually wear Jack down, and really that's just what makes this fight tricky for me, especially when we stop to consider Auntin's personality, and since Auntin's relatively calm and collected, it's likely that he'd undermine Jack’s confidence and instinctual fighting style, making him second-guess his aggressive approach, and since Jack’s fighting spirit thrives on engaging his opponents directly, it could create a mental hurdle for him, but if he finds himself overwhelmed by Auntin’s fear tactics, it could disrupt his ability to land clean hits necessary for building his combo counter, which kind of just creates an intriguing dynamic for me, since Jack, with his high physical strength and relentless pursuit of close-quarters combat, must find a way to breach Auntin's defenses and close the gap, and that's where Auntin's Tag Master ability could be particularly valuable here, allowing him to strategically reposition himself or swap places with objects to avoid Auntin’s shots, but if it's effectiveness relies on Jack's ability to stay within range, which really only complicates matters further, especially since Auntin is skilled at controlling distance. Conversely though, Auntin's ability to manipulate the battlefield with his Nigh Dead Dust allows him to control the tempo of the fight, forcing Jack into a defensive position, and if Jack fails to capitalize on opportunities to engage, he may find himself falling victim to Auntin’s long-range attacks. However, in terms of endurance, both fighters exhibit impressive capabilities, but their approaches differ significantly, for Jack has a relentless fighting style, which gives him a slight edge, since his Recovery Master Hatsu enhances his healing while he sleeps, making him resilient in drawn-out encounters. Although this only goes so far, since in a direct confrontation where quick decisions are vital, Auntin’s reliance on his gun and precision shooting may allow him to finish the fight before Jack can recover or unleash the full potential of his Combo Master, and that's where I personally think brain would play a HUGE part here in this match-up of ""brain vs brawn,"" since strategy and adaptability could very well dictate the outcome. Afterall (to quote Reddit user, canniko), ""the problem with reading versus battles, however, instead of a story someone is writing, is that we, as the viewers, can only really imagine the characters' fighting potential,"" and that's the crux of the issue, which kind of makes it difficult to draw a clear conclusion for me, especially since both fighters possess the potential to shift the momentum in their favor with a single decisive move, but I personally just think Auntin’s strategic mind would grant him the win here, since he can easily catch onto Jack's straightforward fighting style and respond accordingly, which would be key to exploiting Jack’s reckless tendencies, and if Auntin can maintain his composure and control the battlefield through fear, then he may be able to weaken Jack's resolve and hinder his combat effectiveness. However, if Jack should manage to close the distance and unleash a series of calculated strikes, then he could very well turn the tide in his favor, leveraging his Combo Master to overpower Auntin in a flurry of punches.

Ultimately, the outcome of this battle will hinge on their ability to adapt to each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which really only time and the pressure of battle will reveal, but then again, I just woke up, the fuck do I know? I haven't even had my coffee yet. 😅

**Why You’ll Love Pumpkin Cookie Butter Truffles**

Pumpkin Cookie Butter Truffles are incredibly easy to make and require no baking, making them a quick yet impressive dessert. The combination of pumpkin puree, spiced cookie butter, and chocolate creates a melt-in-your-mouth experience that’s perfect for fall. With their rich flavors and elegant presentation, these truffles are a must-have treat for any pumpkin lover.

**Ingredients for Pumpkin Cookie Butter Truffles**

To make these delicious truffles, you’ll need:

* **1 cup cookie butter**
* **1/2 cup pumpkin puree**
* **1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice**
* **1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract**
* **2 cups powdered sugar**
* **12 oz white or semi-sweet chocolate**ﾠ(melted, for coating)
* **Sprinkles or cinnamon sugar** (optional, for garnish)

**Step-by-Step Recipe for Pumpkin Cookie Butter Truffles**

**Step 1: Make the Truffle Mixture**

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cookie butter, pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined.
2. Gradually add the powdered sugar to the bowl, mixing until a thick dough forms. The dough should be firm enough to roll into balls.

**Step 2: Shape the Truffles**

1. Using a small cookie scoop or your hands, roll the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
2. Once all the balls are formed, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 20–30 minutes to allow the truffles to firm up.

**Step 3: Coat the Truffles in Chocolate**

1. Melt the white or semi-sweet chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth.
2. Dip each chilled truffle into the melted chocolate, making sure it’s fully coated. Use a fork or dipping tool to lift the truffle out of the chocolate, letting any excess drip off before placing it back on the parchment paper.

**Step 4: Garnish and Set**

1. While the chocolate is still wet, sprinkle the tops of the truffles with cinnamon sugar or festive sprinkles for a decorative touch.
2. Let the chocolate coating set completely by placing the truffles in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes.

**Tips for Making the Best Pumpkin Cookie Butter Truffles**

1. **Chill before dipping:** Chilling the truffle balls before dipping in chocolate helps them hold their shape and makes the dipping process easier.
2. **Use high-quality chocolate:** For the best results, use high-quality chocolate or melting wafers that melt smoothly and coat evenly.
3. **Adjust sweetness:** If you prefer a less sweet truffle, you can reduce the amount of powdered sugar in the mixture slightly.
4. **Make ahead:** These truffles can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to a week, making them a perfect treat to prepare in advance.
5. **Experiment with toppings:** Get creative with your toppings! Crushed gingersnap cookies, chopped nuts, or a drizzle of caramel sauce make great additions to these truffles.

**Why This Recipe Works**

The combination of cookie butter and pumpkin puree gives these truffles a uniquely rich and spiced flavor that’s perfect for fall. The powdered sugar adds just the right amount of sweetness while firming up the dough. When coated with smooth chocolate, these truffles become a decadent treat that’s both creamy and satisfying, with a hint of pumpkin spice in every bite.

**Serving Suggestions for Pumpkin Cookie Butter Truffles**

* **For holiday gatherings:** Serve these truffles as part of a dessert platter at your next fall or holiday party. Their bite-sized form makes them easy to enjoy.
* **As a gift:** Package these truffles in a decorative box or tin for a thoughtful homemade gift that’s perfect for friends, family, or neighbors.
* **With a warm drink:** Enjoy these truffles with a cup of coffee, hot cocoa, or spiced tea for a cozy fall treat.

I’m really struggling with figuring out what to do for this space. I really like MCM and boho, while my boyfriend likes industrial or American designs, but he’s open. I should mention that I’m not a huge fan of dark wood furniture unless it’s contrasted with lighter woods or other materials (i.e. coffee table with black wood legs but white top). I guess what I’m asking, what are ways in which we could 1) include our preferred styles and 2) incorporate decor & furniture to make this floor feel like cozy. 

Things to consider:
•i’m aiming for a round coffee table to contrast the angles of the couch
•we’re keeping the rug in the living room
•i was thinking of getting a ladder shelf for the split between rooms or a credenza for the dining area.

By Kaylee Tornay / InvestigateWest

*Editor’s note: This story contains descriptions of suicide.*

At first, the police officer stepping into Pamela Antoni’s empty one-bedroom apartment observed nothing out of the ordinary. The air was cool and smelled fresh. Clothes hung in the shower and a packed bag sat on the floor by the bed. 

But Officer Jonathon Fetherolf, an officer in training in Bend, Oregon, also noted the shattered toilet tank lid in the bathroom and the shards of broken beer bottles littering the floor around the couch and coffee table. Walking out the back door, his eyes followed a trickle of white-brown liquid that ran from an empty pint glass across the balcony to the opposite corner. 

Antoni’s body was still there, hanging from the railing. She was 49 years old.

Two stories below, a group of residents who had found their neighbor dead 15 minutes earlier was gathered on the street. Paramedics had blocked traffic with cones and vehicles. Just an hour of daylight filled the sky: It was 6:30 a.m. on June 4.

This was far from the first time Bend police had responded to Antoni’s apartment in the Eddy, a complex billed on its website as “The perfect home in the perfect neighborhood.” But the packed bag, spilled drink and smashed glass didn’t shed much light on how the tragedy unfolded — because the most glaring clues that Antoni had been teetering on the precipice of suicide were not inside her apartment. 

Friends and family described Antoni as fashionable, exuberant and quirky. She was 49 when she died. (Photo courtesy of Greg Kuschnik)
They were in the nine 911 calls she had made over the last six months asking for help with paranoid fears and, once, threatening explicitly to kill herself. They were in the reports from friends and neighbors who received alarming text messages and menacing letters, and who had heard screaming and glass breaking late at night. They were in the door knocks, voicemails and texts from police and the county’s crisis response team, staffed with trained mental health clinicians, who combined had contacted her at least four times before.

He’s from North America and is Arab. We’ve met twice in person, but we text every day. When we met, he told me he was looking for friends to help him learn about the country.

The first ""date"" was supposed to be just coffee, but we ended up spending 12 hours together—eating, going for a walk, and having drinks. He was very polite and nice; he didn’t hit on me in any way. He even gave me his jacket so I wouldn’t be cold and said I could return it next time.

The second time we met was two days later at a social event. We spent time together, and he held my bag so I wouldn’t have to carry it. When we were in a crowd, I reached for his hand, and we held hands for a bit. Then we went to eat, and we talked about many things. At one point, he placed his hand on my forearm and held it there for a bit longer.

Both times we met, he paid for everything, even though I asked him not to. While it’s not unusual here for men to pay, it can be risky because some men think it means you’re going to sleep with them if you agree.

We have another meetup scheduled for this Saturday; we’re going to visit a big market in my city. I’m really excited to see him again, and I think I really, really like him, but I’m not sure if he feels the same way. 😅 Men here are usually very straightforward, and most of the time you know if there’s romantic interest right away.

So, first time posting on reddit. Have been on a long time reading different posts and stuff but never posted myself till now having a reason and needing advice. Warning this is long, type in notes so any problems I apologize.

TLDR: Am I wrong for being mad and my reaction that my ex and hopefully GF again hung out with her ex she had after we broke up the first time more than me while saying she wanted to built up a relationship again with me which I had an issue with constantly and tried to set as a boundary just to date him again while still saying she wanted to build down to a possible relationship with me?

This is mainly about the last ten months but some background to this is me and H dated last year from around April till about the start August. We broke up, it wasn’t really mutual but was on good terms to still talk and just fix the issues we had personally as to not ruin the relationship in the future to possibly come back together. 

Some of the reasons i wanted to take a break was because of not feeling my time was valued, H would say yes to plans with me and my family then not text me the day of till almost 10 in the morning well after i had to leave to go to them, and stuff with her now ex friend saying she was texting her ex that made me put stuff in my head because of her son always mentioning him around still. The reason this stood out was because her son is really good at associating stuff with people, if he saw me he would instantly grab his car seat to go to the park. This lead to a big talk we had about everything that I felt good about but seemed to not matter the next day when I did react the same or how she wanted to a picture she sent and she was upset at that. I can share more details on this but think this gives some idea to what happened the first time. There is some stuff that happened around a pregnancy and stuff that was also really hard around this time that definitely made it harder at the end. I do blame myself for the break up, one thing I wanted to work on was bottling up what I feel which I had been doing for the entire relationship and lead to us breaking up. 

This timenapart didn’t fully work out for a few reasons mainly because of me I wont lie. H still wanted to hang out like before at her house alone which I wasnt comfortable with and distanced myself. H could still text me and message me on insta and did but because I distanced it was spread up mainly texting during in g a holiday like Halloween to say hi and that her son liked my nephews costume. This was the first point I wanted to start talking to her again but saw she was already talk to someone, this is where Z comes into the picture, and I re-distanced myself feeling jealous. The next time that H contacted me was new years with a message saying thank you and she appreciated me for being in her and her son’s life. This is were the story of the last 10 months starts and where I need advice and to see if I am in the wrong and overreacted to everything leading to the last blow up/issue we had mainly me and my feelings. 

The start is this, after the news years message I texted H saying hi and catching up. I quickly saw after adding each other back on insta that she was dating Z and thought I should distance again if I cant separate my feelings for her. I did send a big apology letter from stuff that happened when we first dated and acknowledging what I did wrong and we both talked and kind of built up friendship again knowing thats what it was. During this time she started to open up about her relationship and stuff as a friend saying she didnt feel cared for and was thinking about ending the relationship with Z. This was about the middle of January. We talked like this with her putting up clear boundaries about being in a relationship and still respecting it even though she was thinking about it. This lasted about three months until the end of March with us hanging out every Friday for about an hour on her lunch with Z knowing when I didn’t work and talking about her our past and what went wrong a few times but mainly just drive or get a coffee. At the end of March, she broke up with him. That leads us to the next part and where the problem started for me.

This is long already and don’t want to write a book so I’ll give the events that we both point out as getting to this point. After H and Z broke up our hangouts on Fridays slowly stopped because she said she couldn’t get lunch anymore because of work. This would later be pointed out by her this last week that me making advances past us cuddling and hugging made her uncomfortable because of how i would get mad at her hanging out with Z more then with me after the first major fight we had about it that was about 2.5 months after they broke up, which she didn’t share at the time or I would even ask her the one time we did more if it was ok if she wanted me to stop and she said no it is ok keep going. She did mention starting as just friends again after the stuff with Z and me being mad but never said what that looked like. Which yes, that is definitely my fault. I should’ve probably done a lot better at reading her behavior not her words and just me asking. There are other examples of this throughout the time such as me wanting to give her a kiss in the last 4 months that I would still ask and she would say yes, but she then pointed out that made her uncomfortable and she was starting to push to start as friends again never really given me what that would look like saying stop doing x y or z. This part of the last 7 months is on me and I should have done better but I believe I need to share to give the full story as unbiased as I can.
 
For the parts that I got mad and very upset at stemmed around her and Z. After they broke up and id try to make plans to hang out on the weekend to do stuff which we did occasionally but for the most part 9/10 times H would say no or maybe then say she couldn’t the day of. Which was fine until I noticed she would spend the weekend with Z doing stuff. During this time H also rarely asked me to do anything with her but a hand full of times, mainly only 5 times or so, maybe a couple more in the 7 months span. 

The first main fight which by far wasn’t the first time she hung out with Z but the one that she points out as starting the rift and made her want to start to be uncomfortable with anything romantic. One thing I want to add first is I let her know I was uncomfortable with them hanging out more then we did and her saying no to me all the time before this blow out that made her want to start over and have no romantic stuff. Her explanation for this was “he makes me feel the most cared for right now and I like spending time with him. And I want to be able to have my friends” the same guy she broke up with for not making her not feel cared for makes her the most cared for right after they broke up. The fight itself happen because we had plans for a week before to hang out one Wednesday after work, this didnt happen because she said she didn’t feel good and had a hard day at work, H and Z worked together at the hospital at the time, and she canceled on me while I was coming down from work. Because she said the day was hard because of coworkers and she felt rough and needed her time. I decided to cheer her up and get her a lego flower set, some real flowers, and different ice cream she likes plus a card with some words of support and poking fun at her coworkers she didn’t like that made the day hard. All things ive done when we had dated and in the about 6 months we have talked by this time, one of the times about three weeks before when I brought her ice cream when she asked saying it would help her during her period. So not a random thing. What I found out was, when I went to drop the stuff off to her Z was walking into her apartment. Now I did probably overreact to this, I tore the card and smashed the flowers with another box that had put some stuff she gave me and left them on her porch next to her door for them both to see when he left and texted her i wish them both well to see which wasn’t until 9pm three hours later when she texted me then call. Everytime they hang out she would go MIA so I knew it wasn’t till he left late at night that she saw everything. 

The next blow out and fight we had was because she went out to a place that her family was on a camping trip. Her stepdad, aunt and her partner, other aunt and their partner and another family member were there and she went with Z saying it was because they are so close with him as a family he was invited the only non family member or spouse out there. Which upset me and made me mad

The last one before this fight was because another family climbing trip they did again he was invited and not only that we had plans again to go on a walk it went past the time we said because of it. She also only rode out with Z and not any family or posted her family photos or send me them like she normally would. And I got upset again.

This past week what happen was after everything else before and her not asking her to hang out anymore I stopped asling to do stuff and was a bad texter because of her and Z. During this time for about a three month stretch, we almost didn’t see each other once l, anytime I mention oh it’s hard to talk to someone that you don’t see, she would say I stopped asking her to do things and id explain why because of her saying no every time and that’s a two way street she would say she understands. She asked me to breakfast one time in the three months which was the last time I seen her in person and I didn’t hug her or and didn’t try to kiss. I just walked her to her car then left. 

Two weeks ago she said it seems i don’t like talking to her or ask to do stuff and she tried only for me to seem like i didn’t want to see her because i didnt go to her job when i was sick to sit in the hot tub to relax or when i wanted to get back a stuffed animal my nephew gave me and couldn’t get it in person because I seem distant again and she assumed i wouldnt want to see her. This lead to us talking about why and the distance with her restating the friendship part and nothing romantic. I said to this she will only ever get friendship from me going forward, she said “I dont mean never more, just friends now” which OK I said I needed to start doing better maybe give it another shot coming from her point of view. Just over two weeks later this Friday, I go to dinner with my mom to catch up and see her and Z on a date holding hands across the table then meet face to face when i was coming back in from getting my wallet and she tried to avoid seeing me while he walked her by her waist to his truck. This made me really mad because not even two weeks before when I said only friends going forward she said that’s not what she meant while clearly talking to him enough to be going on multiple dates at the time and already in a relationship with Z again. I had a big reaction saying stuff like I regret meeting her and responding to her new years message plus other stuff of not wanting to speak further. ",1,1728499721.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.99,False

Like all of you i spent way too much time perfecting my sleep routine and chasing that perfect sleep environment. But nothing worked

Here is what did:

1. Fight your demons

Something is keeping you up at night. Stress, anxiety, important change in life. You gotta process it or else it will never go away. Meditate, journal, get therapy, talk to ppl but resolve your pent up shit. I was drowning myself with music and podcasts non stop but.... in bed there is nowhere to hide from your thoughts. 


2. Stimulus

Phones, gaming, alcohol, sugar, intense cognitive activities, porn, doom scrolling, huge meals near bedtime will fuck you up (most of these things will ruin your life in general but especially before bed). Chill out, keep lights dim, do some chores around the house (mop, cook, repot stuff, read). I started taking loooong walks before bed and it helped a lot. NO PHONE ON THE WALK. Just roam and observe the world.

Ps. Dont be too cold. Lost a night of sleep from gymming late than roaming in a t-shirt when it was 8 degrees outside. Might have as well taken an icebath before bed


3. Know your supplements

I take a mix of magnesium, valerian, lthiamine before bed. Melatonin fucks you up long term and benadryl gives me tachycardia. So i had no medical cruch at my disposal. If you take melatonin, read how to take it right (ex. NOT before bed).


4. Bedtime and fatigue

Dont even try to sleep until you can no longer stay awake. Keep doing non stimulating shit until you are just about to curl up on the sidewalk. If you get into bed and cant sleep, there are 2 options:


4.1 just go through meditations (like NSDR). It will lower your HR and maximize your recovery, might even knock you out.


4.2 if you are super alert, get up and skip the night. Go gym, eat a fat chunk of steak, chug a coffee and get a headstart on your day. Next night you will build up so much sleep drive that you will fall asleep at least for some time (provided you followed the rest)


MOST IMPORTANT (cause i forgot to add it and don't want to change the numbers now)

Remember this, you dont need sleep. Yeah you'll be groggy and slow the next day but thats ok. Every sleepless night i got up and drove to work in downtown rush hour and was fine (aka felt like an emotional dumpster fire bud my body functioned fine). Our bodies are very resilient and very self calibrated. Your body will knock you out when it gets tired enough. We do not need to sleep every night. Soldiers in combat zones sleep 2h a night max for months and are ok (its not sustainable for life but functional for pretty long bouts).

Realize it, skip a night of sleep just to prove a point. Then next night go bed not to sleep, but to ""rest"". Be in bed but don't have a goal to sleep. Meditate, daydream and know that you are still recovering. Sleep deprivation effects our mood much more than our body. So dont mind the grogginess and trust your body to take care of you when you get tired enough. Go to bed with one thought ""IF I DONT SLEEP MEANS I DONT NEED IT YET, I AM HERE TO REST UNTIL MY BODY DECIDES IT NEEDS SLEEP""

And some nights you won't sleep (early flight, stressful day, neighbors partying...) but its ok. Trust your body to keep your running and to put you out when you get tired enough

I'm constantly worried about something these days to the point where I sometimes feel my heart pounding or I feel dizzy. I'm a FTM, at 19 weeks. My BIL and his wife just had their baby. We were visiting with them before, and she asked me how I felt. I shared a little bit of my anxiety. The response from her was ""Oh, you should definitely feel baby kicks by now. That will help. I felt mine at 18 weeks!"" when I told her I didn't feel anything yet and that it was probably too early, she acted like this was so strange. 

I know all babies are different and she is speaking from her own experience but I guess I'm just frustrated because I'm so anxious about the baby and I wish I had the good luck to feel baby kicks at 18 weeks.

1fzyrs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1fzyrs3/future_mil_upset_that_i_dont_want_to_be_a_tradwife/,Future MIL upset that I don't want to be a tradwife. ,"So me (19F) and BF (20M) have been together since high-school. We've been dating for almost 5 years now. Last year I moved out of my parents house and into his (BF) parents house. BF has a job and staying with his parents are just cheaper and more convenient and in our country rent is expensive and his pay doesn't allow us to go on our own just yet.

MIL has 2 sons and her husband. I am dating the younger son. Her husband and children are her everything, and being a traditional wife is all she's ever known. She has no hobbies, jobs or life outside of her husband and children and that's why she's so obsessed with my BF and his brother. 

His brother is her favorite because he's the older son, the smarter son, the usual. Also despite them being hyper religious, son is accepted for being gay. They're still homophobic to other gay men, and typically say how they're so glad he didn't turn out to be a *slur* and everyone is always impressed that they are not able to tell that he is gay and all the girls are always jealous and what not. 

The reason I mention this is because there are a lot of double standards, I guess MIL prefers older brother gay because she will be the 'one and only' woman in his life. He's 25 and she still packs his lunch for work, makes his bed etc. He also struggles to get a place of his own. He is a casual dater and has many boyfriends, and never plans to marry and just adopt kids. Parents IL applaud/support him for that. 

Me and bf mentioned that we are not looking at having kids anytime soon, and they got mad that we we're gonna ""stop the generation"" and the ""family name"" has to go on just because we are straight and the second son and me will be the only ones able to have biological children. 

As I mentioned me and bf have lived with them for the past year. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and MIL knows that. Some days I sleep in but I always try to keep my chores on track. For clarification, on Mondays I sweep and mop her kitchen and help her with washing. On top of that I pack my boyfriends lunch for work all week (even if I enjoy making food for my lovely boyfriend, it irks me that it's EXPECTED of me and MIL said that if I can't pack him lunch I am not a good enough wife for him) On Tuesdays I sweep and mop the rest of the house. (Bathroom, hallway, dining room). Wednesdays I vacuum all the bedrooms, living room and dust. (We live next to a cemetery so dust gathers like crazy). Keep in mind I'm not paid a cent for doing all the housework to ""prove"" to MIL that I am worthy of marrying her son. Once a week I cook, because seriously she can cook too. All she does is cooking and washing twice and I am responsible for everything else and barely get paid. I only get paid when FIL works overseas and that's equal to 50 dollars a month. I have to buy my own toiletries with that ""allowance"". When FIL is home my BF pays for my allowance and all my expenses. Three times a week I expect BF to make our bed and get the shower ready and dish up food/make coffee because we like sharing our personal relationship chores. 

Family in law doesn't get that and brother in law (yes, the gay one) says, ""Why the fuck are you making the bed, isn't that why you have a 'wife'"" and even BF was put off by that and upset. Since then he established boundaries with MIL and told her that his brother should mind his business and if anyone in this house is supposed to support modern relationship dynamics it's his gay brother lol. She was taken aback and sheepishly defended his behaviour ""that's just how your brother is and you know he's only joking"" but we both know it's not jokes because a few months ago MIL had one too many boxes of cheap gas station wine and cried and freaked out at me for not being a good wife to her son and over her dead body am I allowed to marry him. 

Yes, we live under their roof for free and it's expected of us to bring our part, we're aware of that. Thats why I never complain of vaccuuming and cleaning as its expected of me but it really gets a lot when the only things MIL do is washing and cooking. We buy food sometimes and top up on things like bread milk and sugar, but still his parents treat us like the black sheep. She is passive aggressive about my depression and when I sleep in her family would make comments like ""In my time we didn't have things like mental health issues and if we slept in our parents would whip us out of bed"" in a condescending tone as if I am a child to be lectured. I might be 19, young, dumb, inexperienced and maybe even the one in the wrong here but I am just so close to breaking point and BF as well. BF is going to look for a better paying job so we can finally go on our own but it's hard.

Family in law has always been sweet enough and supportive and never too bad of a family but their ""traditional"" values and hyper religious double standards and hypocrisy is getting in the way of us having a good relationship with them. I would have expected them to be a bit more forward and open minded, especially with having a gay son and I don't want to get political but they put him on a pedestal and make every other gay man out to be unworthy. BF is also expected to do all the yard work because traditional man yada yada so imagine being 20 years old coming home from a 9 to 5 on a Friday and having to mow the lawn and wash his parents vehicles. 

I know I can't stress it enough, WE ARE AWARE we're supposed to do our part but it feels as though we are the black sheep still. Brother doesn't work on a Saturday, but he doesn't have to mow the lawn or wash the truck or shave the yorkie or whatever. It's not like he makes much more money than his younger brother though. BF comes home on a Saturday and is expected to do it. 

Also, MIL and BIL and FIL are coffee addicts (I get it, me too) 

I always make coffee for everyone when I get up to go make myself some coffee, but they are always in the living room (the kitchen is 7 steps away) and would CALL me from my room to go and make them coffee. This would happen at least 3 times a day. Its some unspoken rule at this point. But when BIL or MIL make coffee they only make for themselves and I have to go back and make for me and BF from scratch because they refilled the kettle. They could at least ask or offer us some as well when they decide to make coffee (which is once in a blue moon).

So yeah I do a lot around the house, but even then MIL is acting passive aggressive towards me. She still acts like I'm not good enough for her son and threatens to take him away from me as she took away past lovers of him and his BF.

I've got into touch with friends and they say that MIL may feel threatened by me and scared that I will take away her son but I am not that kind of person, but even my BF said if she continues acting like this she would cause it to happen herself. 

Also, its not just me and him and his parents. Recently her sister (so bfs aunt) moved into the garage because she lost her job. BF suspects his aunt is now trying to corrupt MILs thoughts because she's also a ""boy mom"" and ""no wife will ever be good enough for my baby boy"" and all that bullshit. Because they frequently enjoy their cheap gas station wine together and MILs sis will bitch and moan about how bad her daughter in laws are and how their sons deserves better and BF is suspecting these chats to be influencing his mom. 

I'm just thinking how dare my MIL and her sister say things like that in our presence even if they guise it under they got drunk and didn't mean it? The laziness comments definitely might come from me sleeping till late and having frequent daytime naps because of my depression, but I always always try to make sure the dishes floors etc are done before I think about bundling up and I always tell MIL when I'm not feeling like vacuuming or mopping that day. 

Back on the topic of mental health, before getting a diagnosis I would cry and get panic attacks at the smallest things and it would be an issue. Luckily I am on medication and recoevong help right now and EVERYONE has been saying I am doing better, even MIL, but I'm still upset about past inconveniences and words shared that are busy resurfacing with AIL staying with us.

Because now again on their time it wasn't acceptable to be so sensitive such as I am and that I should be stronger and they were through much worse in life.

Their feelings are valid, my mother in law's trauma is valid, but why continue this generational trauma?

Why is it accepted, tolerated and ENCOURAGED in these backwards, traditional and conservative communities to be so involved in their children's love lives? When I was 16 I lost the v card to my boyfriend and at that time we were dating for 2 years already. She was enraged and didn't talk to bf or me at all for 3 weeks. The moment we turned 18 and bought our first pack of condoms (that wasn't in secret) she took one out of the box, opened it, and broke it on purpose to make sure it was 'strong enough' (it was fucking DUREX (a brand she reccomended) as she didn't wanna be a grandma soon but would tell me to suck it up and that under no circumstances am I allowed to have a second option whenever I had a pregnancy scare.

Under no way do I judge anyone's political and religious viewpoints and I respect everyone equally but why does she feel she has authority over me and my relationship and how I wanna live my life? Yes I live under her roof but it's still a hard situation. 

BF is amazing though, he chooses me over everything and so far have defended me every time. He's getting fed up with the passive aggression as well and we're just waiting for things to get better. He promised me he will try his best to put us in a better spot and he's sorry that I have to put up with MILs behaviour and if he catches her treating me bad directly he will have a word with her and set even stronger boundaries.

I just am so confused over her sudden demeanor change and what this epidemic of MILS hating their sons spouses even means. I really don't feel like i am in the wrong and I'm always apologising. MIL told me straight up after the huge fight that she isn't expected as the mother of her children to apologise and stuff.

He is now divorced and wants a relationship. I’m torn on how to proceed? ,"TL;DR - I had an affair with a married man five years ago. He has now been divorced for about 6 months and wants to explore a relationship with me. I’m not sure if this is a good idea. 

About five years ago, I (now 34F) worked with a guy (now 37M). We did not work for the same company, but frequently crossed paths and shared clients, so we had a working relationship. 

We often got together with other coworkers and had drinks after work. One evening, we were all having some drinks at his place. His wife and kids were gone for the weekend. We were listening to music and when people started heading home, we continued listening to music and talking. This turned into talking about work to deep conversations about life, our families, religion, etc. I had thought this man was attractive but blatantly knew he was married. I had met his wife and kids at various events. I had no intentions of anything sexual as I respected his marriage. However, that night he initiated a kiss, which led to us having sex. I was single at the time. 

After, we agreed that should not have happened and that it would not moving forward. We kept things strictly professional and that was that. I understood a line was crossed and was very angry with myself for allowing that to happen. 

About a year ago, I left the company I was working for and transitioned to a new company. Similar field, but I haven’t crossed paths with him. Around six months ago, I saw he and his wife’s name on the divorces (small town, newspaper posts divorces/marriages). 

Two days ago, he texts me out of the blue and asks if I would like to grab coffee. I agree. We catch up. He fills me in on the divorce; things had been going downhill for a while and they eventually mutually agreed it was for the best. It was finalized in late April. He said he has a lot of respect for me, finds me to be very intelligent and intriguing. He enjoyed working with me and though he regrets what happened five years ago, he feels we have a connection and he would like to explore that now that he is single. 

I had what I thought would be a long-term relationship in between all of this, but that did not work out and I have been single for about 8 months. I would like to also explore this relationship as he is a very kind, compassionate person and we have a lot of the same interests. However, I understand he cheated and I am worried if we got together, that could eventually happen with someone else. I am at a point in my life that I would like to find a long-term relationship. 

So, Reddit, this is all I can think about. I don’t want to waste my time but I don’t want to miss out on something amazing if there’s a possibility it could work. What do y’all think? ",0,1728499316.0,relationship_advice,26,0.36,False

so, what have i been doing for the last 4 months?  
well, truth be told i was sitting around with my thumb up my ass feeling sorry for myself.  
two months ago i started going to the gym, I didn't really lose weight, but i built a lot of muscle. I also lost a lot of %body fat, so while i wasn't losing weight, i was slimming down.

I then went on Vacation for 10 days to Tunisia.  
Upon returning i went to the Barber and got to look like a person for the first time in a while.

For years before this, I don't actually remember a time where i didn't look in a Mirror or Window and I would see something that i know is me. something that is so very undoubtedly me that i never even questioned it.

Do your case. Focus on your career, body, and mind. Whatever is happening right now just feels toxic, and it's not just you, it's both of us. Blocking triggers a deep sense of abandonment and that's what driving you right now, but fear is no way to live life. For me, it's many things. If it was about being heard, that'd be one thing. If it was about fixing issues, that'd be another. But at this point, my question is about the very fabric of a relationship and what it's supposed to bring.** 

You must be going through a lot of pain deeper than I could ever imagine, everyday when you look at your face and arm it serves as a reminder of how you have stayed with me to only have ever hoped I loved you back the same way you did. You look at me with confusion, resentment, anger, frustration because you had so much hope for us and me and I single handedly destroyed it all including your sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. On top of that I have put you in many impossible position where you must be asking yourself why am I here and what did I do to deserve this, I want you to know with absolute assurance that nothing about my betrayal or violence waere becausae of anything you weren’t, nor was it about anything you did or didn’t do in this relationship. I made the choices I did because of something terribly broken and wrong inside of me. I am responsible for every little step I took over time that led me to ultimately make the choice of being harmful towards you. None of it was ever your fault. I want to take full responsibility for my actions. The infidelity and the violence I introduced into our relationship were wrong, and I know they shattered the trust and security we had. None of this was your fault; it was my choices that caused the pain you're living with now

I hear you, and I understand why you feel this way and why you need space right now. I know the relationship has taken a toll of us, and I realize that continuing in the same cycle without real change is harmful. Relationship is something I have never fully comprehended until I met you and I know to this day I am still failing to take full responsibility of the pain I have caused on you, your friends, and your family, and everything you ever built for. It must be really difficult to see the girl you loved and nurtured destroy everything that was ever valuable to you. I know a relationship with me wasn’t easy to say the least, it brought immense pain to you, and I am sorry for my destructive and unloving behavior which has brought complete and utter devastation to your heart. I was so wrong to do what I did. It has been hard to understand what I am putting you through looks like emotional abuse by undermining your sense of self-worth and personal agency, which creates power imbalance between us. I want a healthy relationship yet where I was failing to see was how far I am actually from “healthy” state. Fear isn’t the way the live life, and honestly, a lot of things are really scary for me right now, but what I do know is I need to show more compassion and patience with you because the trauma I caused on you will not be smooth over with quick fixes if it did, you wouldn’t feel as deep in pain, despair, and resentment as you have been. And that was what I have failed to show you. Fear comes from inactivity and I need to build the confidence in myself to support you and us through this difficult journey. 

**You say I assaulted you and forced you to do things and you have the right to that narrative. I don't see it that way. I see myself as desperately trying to rebuild intimacy that was lost through actions that I did not deserve and hitting roadblocks each time. And over the last few months, I've started to realize it may just be beyond repair. Things that we used to get closer are now just sources of fear.** 

I am sorry to have said those things which didn’t help with building trust and supporting each other. And I am sorry that I made you feel like this is a relationship based on fear, It’s a deep-rooted issue that I am committed to work through because you deserve to be heard and understood by me someone who claims to care deeply about you. I am sorry that aftermath, I haven’t been supportive in recongizing how you put aside how much pain you must be feeling to keep on trying. I understand that my actions have affected you in ways I can’t fully comprehend—your trust, your peace, your sense of safety, and so much more have been deeply shaken. I realize that my behavior has changed the course of your life in ways that may still be unfolding, and for that, I am sorry for all the ways you’ve been further mistreated. For all the refusal to accept full responsibility of my actions, for all the contempt you have experienced on the other side without knowing why or where it’s coming from. For all the times when you present me with opportunities but I failed to protect the relationship. For the attempts to unfairly influence a situation. For all the defensiveness I have shown when you just needed answers, and refusal to give in to you. For all the blame that I have tried to put on to you for what I did, and how it stings you deeply. For how I have been more sorrowful for my own painful consequences than I have been for the pain I’ve caused you. For the lack of empathy towards what you are feeling and going through, not just on your part, but a lack of empathy from others in your life as well. For putting you in a position to need so much support. For my hard heartedness towards you, for the loss of your dreams of the future, for the trauma and devsatation inside, for the way you have felt totally isolated and insane since your world was blown apart repeatedly. For the nightmares and thoughts that intrude peaceful moments and constantly reopen the wound. For all the times you have cried, puked, shaken, and I didn’t offer support. I am sorry for the impatience you’ve been shown for not already just recognizing and validating me, and rushing you in your healing proces. For the pressure you feel to either forgive and forget and put it behind you, or maybe conversely, to walk away and just start over. For what this is doing to our worlds, I am sorry. 

**Stopping infidelity: You did not stop. You ridiculed me all the way till 3 weeks ago and continued your actions** 

**Doing activities: You would not do so without cancelling wasting tens of thousands of dollars**  

**Planning activities: Just not what you do**  

**Music Festivals: Not without fighting me to death** 

**Working at a coffee shop together: Vetoed by you.** 

**Couples therapy: We both participated, we both invested time to make lists - you used it as a tool to get what you wanted while flagrantly breaking your own lists** 

**Travelling: Same as above; you inflicted countless pain when I was travelling and planning for no particular reason at all** 

**Working on mind and body: It's always been out of your no-fly zone**

**Social activities: You fear them and blame me** 

**TV: Begrudgingly, after a month of me asking** 

**Physical intimacy: No, unless you force yourself to get high, because we fear each other. I have a hard time initiating because I have to remember that you went out of the way for other people.**  

**Physical intimacy while high: If you forced yourself, it's the same as me forcing you, and therefore I assaulted you; now it's a severe trigger for both of us**

For so many other losses… your confidence, peace of mind, future dreams, and plans, turst, and sleep, health, and your ability to celebrate and feel happiness, finances, time, productivity and focus, your whole belief system, your self-esteeem, your spirit, hopes for the future, your faith in this relationship, and even faith in yourself. And for all the losesses you haven’t even realized yet. I apologize. I am not proud of how you have experienced so much pain only to have to feel rejected and neglected over and over again. 

The issues you have identified above are correct and not only that the aftermath was even more painful because of my dismissive behavior and showing contempt through body languages. The way I react when you share your pain, I fail to apologize sincerely at the moment and undermine your perception of the events and following up with demeaning, humiliating, and threatening remarks. And I am sorry that I have made the things we used to enjoy so difficult, I am committed to change the way I think about my resistance to addressing fear and focus on the positive and remembering the good and be a partner with you to restore hope in this relationship when you offer the opportunity to.

I need to hold my conduct responsible and make better decisions because the person in front of me is someone who is deeply hurt by me. It’s nobody’s fault, it’s me, it’s not about blame, but it’s about how can I show up for you better for someone who is suffering. 

**Yes, to your credit, we take more walks and reduced cancellations. You stopped infidelity. You're also right - I've done terrible things that I regret. But what's left to enjoy in this relationship? What is there to look forward to? We hurt each other more than the relationship brings and that's the reality. We both deserve to be cared for, but I don't think that can happen the way things are and where they're headed. There's pretty much nothing left we can do without some colossal scene and I'm exhausted. I have work to do. You have a job to find. And maybe that's where we should spend our time. Working on ourselves to move forward.** 

Even though things seem beyond repair right now, I want you to know that I am committed to real, lasting change - not just for us, but for myself. I’ve realized you are much more of an expert and have put in a lot more studious time into this including from your past which means you are literally 5 years ahead of me in this subject and probably feeling even more resentful that I have yet to put in enough work to understand you who has experienced violence caused by me and catch up with you. Moments of kindness or clam don’t invalidate moments of abuse, and in order to stop the abusive cycle, I know I need to do more to accelerate the change and combat my own fear, which led me to I have decided to sign up with the mindfulness coach and a 17 weeks course on affairrecovery that focuses on creating safety, developing empathy, respect for self and others, healthy communication, and heartful listening and avoiding relapse for the other WP I have spoken to they have offered this as a resource that is helpful. I’ve started working on myself in ways I hadn’t before. I’m committed to addressing the deep issues that led to my harmful actions and ensuring that I never cause this kind of pain again, to you or anyone else. This is about real, lasting change, and I’m committed to doing whatever it takes to become the person who can be worthy of trust again. I know it may seem impossible to imagine, but I truly believe that with time, healing, and real work on my part, we can find a way to reconcile. I am committed to becoming someone who can contribute to your healing, rather than causing you more pain. I want us to rebuild something healthier, but I know that starts with my own growth and responsibility

Love is a subject that is complicated and complex. I will admit I am still understanding love and how to do it, but what I do know is after all of this, I still believe it’s you I would want to do this with. Love is applyin a gentle lens towards what is failed, disgraced, and broken, unappealing, angry, and foul in other people and ourselves. It’s about directing sympathy in the most unexpected directions at what is messed up, in peces, and what we might hate and even be frightened of. It’s to devote active charity towards the mistake and aberrations. I am sorry for all the ways I have made you feel ashamed of your reactive abuse and rely on them as a weapon to not have seen or heard you. There are always going to be dark and rough times in a relationship as I have come to understand, but it’s the hope that perhaps through all of this we have a much better understanding for each other and have learn to love each other for all the good and bad and find beauty and comfort in them because we believe in us. I know there is so much more that I can do on top of the changes I am already making to understand this more deeply and translate my love for you in a way that look past our evident failings in a tender search for our deeply hidden merits.",0,1728499272.0,SupportforWaywards,1,0.4,False

I’ve noticed some new condos popping up, sidewalks getting installed (ugh, pedestrian-friendly), and these first-time homeowners keep moving in, acting all excited about “community improvements” and “safety.” Meanwhile, the real heartbeat of the neighborhood—our totally legit gambling fronts—are under threat!

We can’t let this happen, y’all. These fine establishments provide a much-needed break from the soulless gentrification happening around us. Who needs peace and quiet when you can have an after-hours EDM rave and questionable parking lots? Not to mention, what other business model could so effectively keep the riff-raff out of the bougie farmer’s market crowd?

So, what can we do to protect these bastions of local character? Maybe we should start a petition for “small business support” or organize a neighborhood poker night to show solidarity?

I have just started OMAD intermittent fasting Mon-Thur with Friday being my cheat day to eat out with the Wife or friends but then fasting until Monday Lunchtime.

This is my second week and I went from 218 to 221!
I was shocked, disappointed and generally concerned that I somehow gained weight from eating very little. I'm concerned that fasting has slowed my metabolism but I'm not fasting enough to actually lose weight. 

I drink 1 cup black coffee in the morning Sun-Thur. Water throughout the day and maybe 1 Green or Black tea with some pink Himalayan salt sprinkled in if I'm feeling hunger pangs or weak.

When I break my weekend fast I drink 1-2 cups of unsweetened Kefir milk to ease my digestion back before eating a real meal later that day.

Friday Dinners with my wife is usually PHO, Steak, Chicken Wings, Chipotle,Spaghetti,homemade Chicken Rice Soup or Korean BBQ + Hot Pot.

Meals when eaten Mon-Thur are generally either Chipotle, Chicken/turkey breast sandwich with Tomatoes, cauliflower starch small pizza with pepperoni and cheese or scrambled eggs with bacon and either toast or hashbrowns.

TL;DR - specifically where/how do you want to meet women in the wild as friends and as dates?

I am a pretty cool, single, mid-30s Bend woman wanting to meet more like-minded men for friends and to date. It's been so easy to make female friends here! All we do is chat about our dogs at the park and we have coffee plans the next week. But it's proving challenging to meet men organically.

For several reasons I do not feel that dating apps are the answer, and I want to do my part to engage in real life with the people I want to meet. The Bend Buzz is fantastic (thank you, [](https://www.reddit.com/user/CIWorkshop/)!) - however, so far the events I've attended from there are super fun but not well attended by single men looking to connect with single women. Maybe I put the flower behind the wrong ear? And not to say that partnered men can't become friends - but it's easier/less complicated to befriend single men, I think.

So - where do we find one another? Right now my plan is to set up a whiskey stand at Green Gate, like a lemonade stand but for neat dudes, and see who I can catch in my stop-and-chat trap.

Seriously, though - from your perspectives (and local specific examples help), what can I be doing to create these openings for connection? Where do you and/or your single friends hang out with the intention of meeting women?

    With a view to being able to play Monster Hunter Wilds in better conditions (release at the end of February) I would like to be able to benefit from your valuable advice with a view to improving my current config which dates from 2019. This is what it is made of for the moment:
    

Case : Be quiet! BGW25 

SSD : SAMSUNG 860 EVO 250 Go

CPU cooler : NOCTUA NH-U12S

RAM : Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 Go DDR4 3200MHz C16 XMP 2.0

Motherboard : Gigabyte Z390 GAMING X  Intel Socket LGA 1151

Power supply : be quiet! Pure Power L8  ATX 630W  certification 80 Plus Bronze

Monitor : BenQ ZOWIE XL2411P 24 inches, 144hz

    My general goal is to be able to play recent video games (not just MHWilds) at 1440p with a guarantee of at least 120 constant fps.
    
    I built my PC on my own but I don't know much about component compatibility, that's why I'm turning to you. I would like to be able to only change the screen and graphics card but I don't know if this is viable given the objectives mentioned above.
    
    My budget would be €1000 if there is only a screen and a GPU to change.
    
    As for the screens, I looked at what was going on and this one looks pretty good to me, it meets a certain number of my criteria (notably in terms of connectivity with at least one display port, one HDMI and one jack): TUF Gaming VG27AQ HDR - 27 inchesASUS.
    
    I had also seen this one but the stand doesn't suit me and would take up too much space on my desk: AOC Gaming Q27G3XMN - 27-inch QHD monitor.
    
    For graphics cards I also looked a little but I am not able to identify the best choice for my current configuration but I saw interesting things in the 600€-700€ range.
    
    One last question, should I wait before buying knowing that a new generation of GPUs may be announced/released early next year and that this could lead to a drop in the cost of previous generations?

I never processed the grief, and it took two years to get over that breakup. To avoid my emotions, I drank, partied, and had meaningless hookups.

Two days before I started dating my ex, my grandpa passed away after a long illness. I had strong feelings for her, but looking back, I realize I used our relationship to block out my grief.

Things improved, and I loved her even more, but deep down, I wasn’t as happy as I should have been with my life. I ignored those feelings.

Six months ago, things in her life got difficult, and she needed me. I was there for her, but she became obsessive, jealous, and controlling, even gaslighting me. It got unbearable.

In August, we went to a friend’s birthday party. Before picking up the friend, we had a huge fight in the car. I calmed down, but she kept yelling and calling me names, even while driving. The friend noticed and stuck by me the whole night, bringing me drinks and food. My ex got jealous because this friend had never acted that way with anyone else.

It took us two weeks to stop bringing up that night. The friend texted me once after the party to check if I was okay and mentioned she was planning to meet with my ex to discuss her behavior. My ex apologized but was annoyed with the friend, after their talk.

The fighting didn’t stop. Whenever we went out and drank, she’d yell at me at some point, even over small comments like ""My ex knows this guy"" (we never had a rule about not mentioning exes).

After one of the fights, I reached out to that friend because I had no one else to talk to and ended up leaving my ex at the party. That’s when things started to go downhill. The friend wanted to be there for me, and we met for coffee twice afterward (my ex knew about this). The friend was also going through a breakup, so we became each other’s support system. However, my ex clearly didn’t like it and became obsessed with whether the friend was texting me, when, and what we were talking about.

Since I had shared things about my ex with the friend, I started hiding how much we were talking and the topics of our conversations. The friend covered for me too. A few weeks later, I realized the friend might like me. I asked her directly one night, and she admitted it without saying it outright. I realized I had feelings for her too.

We had plans to go to another city with my ex the next day. On the way back, after dropping off my ex, the friend and I stayed in the car talking for two and a half hours. Our feelings were intense, and we ended up kissing.

I broke up with my ex two days later, not just because of the kiss but because her behavior had pushed me away. After that, the friend suddenly changed her stance, saying it wasn’t a good idea for us to be involved and that she wanted something serious, but it wasn’t the right time. While I understand her reasoning, it felt like she only realized this after leading me on.

In the end, I realized that her rejection was the best thing for me because it gave me space to heal instead of falling into another emotional pattern. As contradictory as it is, I want both a new, exciting adventure and time alone with myself.

My issues now are feeling like this friend made a fool of me (since I sensed her interest first), and now I’m grieving over two girls at once.

Any advice on how to get over this? Especially the part where I both want and don't want to see someone. And I would appreciate if you have some insights I've missed.

**TL;DR:** My ex and I dated for 2.5 years, but the last 6 months were awful due to her becoming controlling and jealous. I confided in a mutual friend, and we became close. After realizing we had feelings for each other, we kissed. I broke up with my ex, not just because of the kiss but because her behavior had pushed me away.

1fzy65p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1fzy65p/how_a_youtube_video_inspired_me_to_build_a/,How a YouTube video inspired me to build a complete AI-Powered Image Platform From Scratch (And What I Learned Along the Way)...,"How One YouTube Video Led Me to Build a Full-Blown AI Image Platform – Here’s My Journey

Hey /SaaS, I wanted to share a bit about my startup story and how I ended up launching [https://AIDreamCreator](https://AIDreamCreator), a bleeding-edge AI image generation platform. It’s been a wild ride, and I’m hoping this resonates with some of you.

So it all started with a YouTube rabbit hole (don’t they all?). I stumbled across a video showcasing Photo AI, and while it was cool, I remember thinking, there’s gotta be a better way to do this—faster, smoother, with more control for users. Also the fact that levelsio (the creator of Photo AI) shared his journey on the Lex youtube podcast saying he was making $150k a month... I already had a passion for learning all about every new AI, and  I do have experience in tech, I taught myself Javascript, HTML, VB, C#, lately i learned a bit of Python and I've always used PHP for my projects + SQLLite databases.  So I decided to create a similar (but better!) service than his.

But  I had never built something quite like this before a ""Web3"" site. Despite that, I couldn’t shake the idea of creating a more powerful platform, one that could do things like realistic clothing changes, high-end 8X upscaling, and posing models (ControlNet) through AI, of course using Flux AI, the latest most photorealistic model available today..  And that’s where the journey began.

Fast forward about 8-9 weeks (can't remember now.. but yes i'm a very fast developer when I want something done) late nights and enough coffee to sink a ship, and I’ve built what I think is a platform that’s not just a wrapper for some AI tools—it’s something bigger. AIDreamCreator includes ControlNet for posing, truly working clothes-changing tech (which I’m particularly proud of which helps Shopify store owners showcase their products on AI models), and cutting-edge 8X upscaling, all packaged in a user-friendly interface.

I’ve also added some more creative categories (scenes you can generate with 1 click), like Professional Photos, LinkedIn Photos, boudoir ( for the ladies) , and even categories an AI girlfriend (for the ladies), to really expand the potential use cases. Mobster, Travel the world, and many other categories that I can easily add to the app using a simple text file and a jpg (i set up the software architecture this way).

Of course, it hasn’t been all smooth sailing. I used Claude AI more times than I can think of, got used to advanced javascript+php coding, had to deal with HTTP APIs to connect to AI services such as FAL AI and Replicate, had to use Python APIs with partially-written instructions, had even once (reverse engineer!) the raw response from FAL API since their docs were outdate.. Had to write code in Python with a FLASK APP that handled my endpoints, and handled webook calls back from AI services when tasks were finished.

Now that I'm ""done"" with the site, i've had a few beta testers and I've tested it myself to death (everything works just fine, just has minor tiny bugs). Marketing this kind of product has been tough, especially trying to navigate social media ads and running into issues with content policies (looking at you, Reddit Ads). I should have started with Twitter posting every step of my journey but I was too focused and engulfed in learning all the tech and writing the code... But I’ve been persistent and have recently started sharing my story more openly on Twitter, Facebook, and even making ad content with platforms like HeyGen to better engage potential users. I've made about 10 videos showcasing my app using AI avatars and screen recording, editing using CapCut PRO (that app is really fun to edit things with)

Right now, my focus is on driving organic traffic and creating something people want to use. If anyone’s been down a similar road, I’d love to hear your thoughts on promoting a SaaS in a space as niche (and sometimes sensitive) as AI image generation.

Also, feel free to check out [https://aidreamcreator.com](https://aidreamcreator.com), and let me know what you think. Happy to answer any questions about the tech behind it or lessons learned from the grind of building and launching this thing!

Thanks for reading!

Cheers to all SaaS startups,

i (24f) recently applied to med school and got through my first interview. this has been my dream since i was little and im nervous and excited at the same time. my (25m) partner has been with me for nearly 6 years and has supported me so much throughout the entire process, sending me coffee money whenever i was studying, gassing me up, and just being an overall cheerleader for me to pursue my dream career. 

in the past, when we’ve discussed it, he’s usually said he’s open to traveling (he’s a nurse) wherever i’d go and do travel nursing. or he’d say let’s get an apartment together if it’s in our home city / state. it’s never been a concrete thing but if it got brought up in the past that’s usually what he’d say. 

the last few weeks have been rough and i could feel him kind of holding me at arms length. finally i broke down last night and asked what was wrong and he admitted he didn’t want to do long distance. he said he loves me and wants to be with me, but if i got into med school across the country (farthest i would be is a 3 hour flight, i applied to schools in my state and surrounding because i want to be as close to home as possible) he couldn’t do long distance again. (we dated throughout college and i went to a school 2 hrs away from him, but we made it work all four years). i was shocked to say the least after his past comments of being open to going where i go and he was very apologetic about not opening up sooner because it was really tearing him up. 

we both cried a lot last night and didn’t really come a solution, but we both agreed that we still love each other. i told him i felt like i wasn’t worth it if he’s so adamant now about not doing distance, and he said “no, it’s not you at all” but it kind of does feel that way still. he’s aware how contradictory he sounds and he just keeps saying he doesn’t have a good answer. 

i’m very distraught because this might be completely over nothing on the chance i get into a school close by. but if i do get in farther away, then he was basically like “i’ll always be in your life” but i couldn’t stand to hear that because i know i can’t ever just be friends with him. 

it feels like there’s now an expiration date on the relationship if i do go away for school. we both love each other so much and spent the rest of last night just holding each other and not sleeping well. 

how do i move forward? med school is my dream but he is too and while i know i will go anywhere i get in regardless of him, i can’t help but feel so lost because it could mean the end of our relationship. pls help ",2,1728497785.0,premed,6,1.0,False

How do I get this to stop?","I am currently 25F and recently started my senior year of college. It’s taking me longer than the traditional 4 years to get my bachelor’s. For relevancy to the story, I met ""Dan"" (23M) about 2 years ago in a mutual club. But at the time of our first meeting, I was 23 and he was 21. We chat, we get along amicably, we text about stuff. One day he all but ghosts me without reason. Whenever I texted to try to arrange plans, he’d agree before standing me up when the time and day came. He’d give very short one word answers to any questions I asked. So I decide it’s not worth it and we fall out of touch, though I occasionally saw him in mutual clubs socializing with everyone except me.

Fast forward to now. I'm doing my usual routine with schoolwork and clubs and see him, but ignore him. But he suddenly takes to talking to me more and is seemingly interested in what I'm saying. I'm hesitant, but think that maybe Dan has changed somewhat and so politely chat back. I find he’s still the same person from before, so it’s not the most interesting of conversations (to me at least). After club, he then suddenly asks to meet up in a few days over coffee. I honestly got caught off guard and was speechless. It’s been more than two year since we chatted about anything and now he’s asking to catch up with me? I ask why he wants to meet up, and he says he wants to catch up with an old friend.

Maybe it was a little rude, but I asked what about us makes us friends. Dan was the one to ghost me over two years ago and consistently stood me up or ditched me when we made plans. He didn’t reach out to me since then. Why would I consider such a person my friend? Dan immediately gets upset at me for being ""unnecessarily mean"" to him, and an argument breaking out. General gist is that he wants a second chance, mixed with how I'm being cruel for not giving that to him. I demand answers for why he ghosted me, which he refuses to give beyond vague answers of ""I had a lot going on"". I flat out tell him that while it was his choice to stop talking to me and it was okay for him to do that, it's not okay to expect me to put my life on hold on the off chance he might want to be around me.

We part on angry terms. Dan must’ve shared my number and social media contact information with his friends because I’m now getting nasty texts and comments from unknown numbers and profiles. All generally revolving around how Dan just wanted to catch up, insults at me for being “a cold frigid bitch” among other elaborate namecalling, and talking about how I'm missing out on such an amazing person. Dan himself is mixed between insulting me and asking for forgiveness. The times I try to defend myself and reason with him, he turns it into a massive argument where I always end up the bad guy for not giving him another chance. Keep in mind, Dan still hasn’t even apologized or given a reason as to why he ghosted me two years ago! My friends are on my side, and have helped defend me on said social media where they could. But I haven't done anything about the texts yet. Haven't blocked them yet either. Just kind of feeling emotional whiplash among lots of other things at the moment.

It hasn't been a full week since the argument, so maybe I'm being excessively paranoid and this'll stop on its own before the end of the month. But I've heard tales of stalkers stalking people for longer, and am afraid Dan might do this. I'm also feeling exhausted at the thought of potentially having endless circular arguments with him or having to alter my whole schedule just to avoid him. Is there anything I can do to get this to stop?

Tldr: Old “friend” reached back out to me, I refused to catch up with him. Now his friends are calling me names for not giving him another chance and I’m feeling exhausted at the thought of dealing with stuff like this for the remainder of my last year in college",1,1728497608.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Norway is known for its breathtaking landscapes and exceptional cuisine, but it’s also notorious for high living costs, especially regarding food. The price may be steep, but the quality and flavour are worth it. This article explores how to enjoy Norwegian food without overspending, using insights from Delilah, a British expat in Oslo.

# Embracing the ""Kos"" Lifestyle

Since moving to Norway, I’ve embraced the idea of “Kos”—it’s about enjoying life’s simple pleasures, especially when it comes to food. Seafood reigns supreme here, with salmon, cod, and herring taking centre stage. I’ve also grown fond of Brunost, a sweet, caramel-like cheese unique to Norway. And let’s not forget the Kvikk Lunsj chocolate bar—it’s become my family’s favourite snack during hikes.

In Oslo, where I live, food options are plentiful. While some meals can be pricey, like dining out in restaurants, I’ve found ways to eat well without breaking the bank. For instance, supermarkets sell affordable rotisserie chickens, and 'dagens rett' meals are a great way to dine out at reduced prices. If you’re a student like me, meal prepping with simple sandwiches and salads can save a lot of money.

# Drink Prices: Beer and Coffee in Norway

Drinks in Norway are not cheap. A pint of beer can cost around £6.01 to £7.34, while a cup of coffee will set you back £2.20 to £3.67. That said, enjoying these drinks against Norway’s incredible scenery often makes the cost worthwhile. Happy hour deals are your friend if you want to enjoy a drink without breaking the bank.

# Eating Out with Family in Norway

Restaurant prices can range from £58.80 to £88.20 for a meal when dining with family. However, street food and casual dining options can be much cheaper, allowing you to experience Norwegian food without the hefty price tag.

# Living in Norway: A Lesson in Quality and Simplicity

Norway has truly taught me to value the beauty of simplicity and high-quality ingredients. Although dining out tends to be pricey, savouring Norway's unique culinary offerings is possible without stretching your budget. Cooking at home with local produce or discovering lesser-known spots for affordable dining are great ways to indulge in Norwegian food culture without breaking the bank.
