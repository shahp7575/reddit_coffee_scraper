1j12vm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1j12vm5/how_do_i_be_single/,How do I be single?,"18F got this app because my friends said I should try and ask other people-
How do I be single? I recently broke up with my boyfriend about a week ago, he was a great guy but I realized I was dating the idea of him more than I was actually dating him. I would hold myself back from doing things alone and use him as a safety net that I could bring with me- he was my plus one to group hangouts, gym partner, my person to text when bored, etc. but I didn’t really like him I don’t think, when I realized this I expressed my feelings and ended things. 

Now most people I talk to encourage me to be single, work on myself, etc. I literally cannot fathom what that means though. Since I first started dating I always had some to just give my attention and validation to- whether it was a potential partner or someone I was actually dating. 

I’ve tried to start doing my hobbies but idk it just feels weird to go the day not conversing w a romantic interest (which ik is insane to say) the other day I went to the store and got stuff for myself and bought myself coffee and it felt nice but it felt like lonely and weird to do alone. Ofc I have friends I could go with but I’m worried id replace the boyfriend position with the friend position and not actually address the root problem. 

How do i realistically be single and stop trying to ‘live for’ a romantic interest?",1,1740845339.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

Di lahat ng tao comfortable makalanghap ng usok ng mga vape nyo, kahit pa sa tingin nyo eh di naman yan kasing baho sa yosi. 

I was having out with some friends sa Foam Coffee Shuntug Branch kanina. Sa outside seating kami, kasi puno na sa loob. After some time, may naaamoy na akong vape. Galing pala sa katabing table namin, lalakas ng loob kasi may kasamang bodyguard eh. But we contemplated if we'll confront or not, kasi malay namin kung may baril yan, eh di naging kwento pa kami. Nagparinig nalang muna ako nung una na bawal. Di talaga natigil sa kakahipak eh. I finally stood up para magrestroom, sabay advice sa staff na may nagvavape sa labas. Buti nakonsensya kayo at naisipan nyo tumigil tsaka umalis nalang bago kayo masita.

Ano ba hindi nyo maintindihan sa bawal ang manigarilyo at magvape dito sa Baguio City? Please lang, wag na irason na hindi alam na bawal,  kasi by their looks mukhang di naman sila first timers dito. I took a picture of them just in case they won't stop vaping, so I can report in case wala rin gawin ang establishment. They knew na bawal ginagawa nila kasi pasimpleng nagtakip yung girl ng mukha gamit bag nya. And if you're gonna ask bakit sobrang affected ako, I am pregnant and praning for my baby. 

P.S. If you guys are here, matuto kayong magtiis ng need nyo for vaping, when in public dito sa Baguio.  I don't care if you vape or smoke kasi buhay nyo naman yan. Pero matuto kayo sumunod ng ordinansa at maging considerate sa iba. Just because you're with someone who seems like they have a lot of connections, does not mean you can be entitled and be above the law. ",3,1740845152.0,baguio,0,1.0,False
1j12s7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1j12s7r/super_frustrated_with_local_starbucks/,Super frustrated with local Starbucks,"I’m sure I’ll be somehow seen as the problem but I’ve lived near the same Starbucks for like 8 years now? It is a walk in only store. I wasn’t into Starbucks or coffee that much the first like 2 ish years I moved to the area I’m at. Then for the first two years I rarely went to the walk in one because I had my daughter who was a little toddler and so drive thru was way easier. But once my daughter hit 4/5 years old (she’s 7 now) I started frequenting this Starbucks more because it’s directly on the way of most of the places I go, (my work, take my daughter school, even errands like it tends to be on my way to everything.) 

The first year or so my drinks were always right! My drinks always tend to be super simple too. Super hard to mess up. And then after like that first year where a bunch of old baristas left suddenly my drinks would be made wrong like 50 percent of the time. Since usually they’ll remake it and most of the time the second remake would be perfect I still choose to frequent this Starbucks due to the inconvenience of having to go down the street the opposite way from where my work, errands etc so I don’t have to do a round trip and backtrack for no reason. 

However like over this last year I’ve even taken breaks from drinking coffee I went from going every day mostly to like barely once or twice a month and only if my daughter wanted to go. But then I’ll go through periods where like every day I want my specific coffee cause I’m having my drink/food fixations and then I’ll not go for a few days/weeks etc. My usual drink after all this time is a double iced espresso, 6 pumps of vanilla, and extra vanilla cold foam. Pretty easy. Literally the day before yesterday I’ve been getting in there like super early 6:30-7 am before their rush closer to 8 am. They forgot the vanilla. I asked for a remake. They then set the next one out and it’s immediately wrong. Vanilla syrup was sitting at the bottom, espresso on top not stirred in with the vanilla, and barely any cold foam. 

It immediately set me off because the first drink would have been perfect if they didn’t forget one of the only 3 ingredients I asked for. I paid for extra cold foam I want more than an inch of it. I know baristas don’t mix the espresso with the cold foam which I don’t want them to anyways I want to do it but I’ve never been handed this drink before with the vanilla syrup just sitting in the very bottom not mixed with the espresso. 

This last year with the amount of times I’ve had to leave the store, call corporate, get a refund and go back across town to the Starbucks out of my way just to get the coffee I want because if it comes out wrong the first time over at this Starbucks within the last year the chances of the remake being right is almost 0. When they missed the vanilla and handed me the wrong remake the baristas solution was to try and dig out cold foam to pour espresso out to make room for more cold foam? I literally stared like what? I don’t even want it now, just refund me I’ll go somewhere else. It’s not hard drink but you’re making it hard. 

So frustrating because the day before that and yesterday the drink was right. Only when I went in yesterday morning the cashier taking the order thought she was gonna be retailtory and aggressive with me and I was just gonna let that slide when taking my order. Like girl, what are you mad at me for ? Because I know me asking for a refund and going to another Starbucks to get one 3 ingredient drink made correctly the first time is way more inconvenient for me than you, especially when I don’t even get rude. I’m matter of fact and blunt that I won’t be dealing with wrong remakes today, that if it’s too hard this specific day to get it right I can go somewhere else, but now I feel challenged like you want to act like a ***** okay well I’m more of one so do you really wanna go there? Cause I’ve been nice despite the major inconveniences of having my drinks made wrong somewhere to 30-50 percent of the time, I mean I can show them how not nice of a person I truly am. So I called corporate to let them know that apparently there it’s okay for baristas to act and behave aggressively in retaliation for a customer not just taking the wrong drink and saying “oh thanks it’s wrong but I’ll drink it anyways for the $6 I paid for it! Like thanks so much I’ll be happy to drink a bad tasting coffee” Um no. No I won’t be doing that.

Gone are the days where it merely replaces the coffee guy or tweaks your Spotify playlist. Somewhere in Minnesota, AI has allegedly taken a dark turn, with a former school worker using it to create explicit images of children under his care. Yeah, you read that right. Artificial intelligence is now a tool in crimes we wish were confined to dystopian novels.

According to the charges, William Haslach, a longtime school employee, allegedly used AI to transform innocent photos of kids into disturbing images. It's the kind of plot twist none of us wanted. And, as forensic expert Heather Barnhart notes, the situation isn't unique—it's a new, ugly chapter in technology misuse. ""This is going to get worse,"" she warns. With AI galloping ahead in power and capability, it seems we're in a catch-up game of trying to outsmart the tech before it outsmarts us—or worse, outsmarts our morals.

Legislators like Minnesota State Sen. Erin Maye Quade are racing to draft laws that hold AI companies accountable. The goal? To prevent a world where anyone with a smartphone and a bit of malice can conjure disturbing images out of thin air. Meanwhile, Barnhart suggests we keep our kids' digital footprint as minuscule as possible. The fewer photos floating in the tech ether, the safer they might be.

As Haslach faces both federal and state charges, we're left grappling with how such technology can be wielded so irresponsibly. It's a somber reminder that as AI continues to evolve, our ethical compass must keep up—or risk being hopelessly outdated.

I  usually just carry 10"" e-reader, wallet, battery, bottle of water, phone, and small toiletries.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j12ngz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1j12ngz/full_birth_story/,Full birth story,"Hey all, 
I thought I'd come back and share my birth story since we're more than 48 hours out and I know some new moms in here are really anxious and I was super anxious still as a second time mom.

I had Braxton Hicks for 6 weeks. They say these shouldn't be painful but they're lying apparently. These felt like moderate to intense period cramps but they weren't really timeable or consistent.  

At 37 weeks I was not at all effaced but 1cm dilated, I was told that's pretty common if you've given birth before even though my first birth was 9+ years ago.  

At 37 weeks I went into podromal labor. This feels just like real labor but it doesn't actually produce any change. I had mild contractions every 2 minutes, then they might be extremely painful but every 45 minutes, then moderate every 15 minutes, then stop entirely for a few hours. After I went in and got sent home, it went on for 8 days.  This was the hardest part of my entire labor experience because I had to stop working, I didn't get great sleep, it was a constant question of ""is this turning real? Is any change happening?"" After 5 days of it I had an appointment and cervical check. The cervix was softer but no more dilated.  My doctor was on vacation so on day 7 of podromal labor when she was back I sent her a message in the portal begging for an induction because I didn't want to cut into my leave time before baby is even here and I just couldn't take the ongoing contractions any more. 

She got me scheduled for the next night at 10 pm when I was 39+0. When I went in, they did a bunch of paperwork, got me in a gown, and within an hour or so they had applied a cervical ripening prostoglandin suppository. In 4 hours I was about 70% effaced but no more dilated. They applied again and in another 4 hours I was at 90% effaced and almost 2cm. This was enough for the doctor to feel comfortable breaking my water to start labor.  

Breaking the water wasn't painful, it was a weird sensation though.  It was a LOT of fluid.  We soaked through my sheets, gown, waterproof pad, and like 3 towels. Even after breaking, your placenta will keep producing new fluid so you will continue a slow leak until delivery. 

At this point they had a mobile ultrasound tech come in and check baby's position.  She was head down but ""sunny side up"". You want baby to be facing your butt when she comes out because she will fit a lot better that way. 

They gave me an intravenous pain medication at this point to help the contractions and it was STRONG. I felt super high. It only lasted about 2 hours. They had hoped the contractions would flip baby but they didn't, so after that they put me in a pad for the fluid leaking and had me moving around. We did a lot of movements on all fours, shake the apple tree, dip the hip, figure 8's on the birthing ball, etc. My nurses were amazing at positioning. 

After a few hours they started the pitocin, maybe around 6 or 7 pm. I requested my epidural placed prior to starting pitocin so they did that first. The epidural is scary but it was worth it. You sit up on your bed and curl over in a C shape and tuck your chin down to make space between vertebre in your back. You will feel a pinch when the doctor inserts and they quickly replace the needle with a softer catheter. It's most important not to move when the doctor is doing this part, but it really is just a pinch. Then the doctor inserts the meds and that is the rough part. They warned me it's like a wasp sting and they weren't kidding, I def yelled ""sonofabitch!!"" Lol. Then he said he was doing a test dose and they watch you for a few minutes to make sure it's placed right. If it wasn't, you would know right away because the symptoms would be very obvious. My legs started to get warm and then numbed. It works on gravity, so there was a portion of my belly that didn't numb until they rolled me a little.  

I could still feel the contractions because they would start with a little gush of fluid squeezing out. I could still feel warmth and pressure, and still a little pain, but maybe 2 out of 10. The nurse brought in a peanut ball and positioned me to continue trying to turn baby. We did lots of that and eventually went back to all 4's. They can adjust your bed so that you can get into child's pose sort of, and jiggle your butt during contractions. That will get baby to turn and lay in your belly like a hammock and finally get facing your butt. The all 4's with pitocin did turn her, but BIG WARNING this can dislodge your epidural, which we did not realize.  

When I got out of this position the contractions got very intense and the pain was getting strong.  They had been increasing pitocin every 30 minutes or so and I was at the max dose, and the contractions were on top of eachother, and the epidural had stopped working. They sent for an anesthesiologist and it felt like it took YEARS for him to get there. It was maybe 15 minutes but the longest 15 minutes of my life. The pain was so bad I was yelling through contractions and literally sobbing. There wasn't more than a few seconds break in between. He finally got there and decided the epidural was in place so he gave me what he called a ""cocktail"" by inserting it in the line directly. I'm still confused by what exactly happenned to it and why it stopped working, but whatever he did fixed it. After about 5 minutes the pain was dull again. At this point I was 7cm but baby was finally in ideal position. The nurse left but told me if I felt pressure between contractions to let her know right away.  

After maybe 2 more contractions I felt like baby's monitor was being pushed out by the contractions and the pressure was building so I called for my nurse. She barely touched me to begin checking and dashed out the door to yell ""baby's at 0, let's go"" haha.  

My doctor wasn't there yet, so two random doctors came in, a nurse for the baby came in, and we just focused on *not* pushing yet.  A huge light came out of the ceiling, people started assembling, they put the stirrups up on the bed, etc. Lots of sudden movements. Doctor took about 10 minutes to get there and came in the room snapping gloves on lol. She was ready to go. You do 3 pushes per contraction for 10 seconds each.  I pushed through 3 contractions, so 9 total pushes. I had 2 tears, 1 first degree internal and one that the doctor said was barely a second degree. I got one stitch in each.  I did not feel the stitches at all. I didn't feel the placenta come out either because the minute baby was out, they put her on my stomach and I was so overjoyed by that, it didn't matter what else was happening. She was absolutely covered in vernix which my nurses jokingly call ""cheese"" and they were pleased because she was a super cheesy baby lol. 
They didn't bathe or weigh her, just made sure she was crying and stable and they just left us to bond. I got two hours with her and hubby just to do skin to skin and got her to latch the first time, but they did come in and palpate my tummy every 15 minutes. After that they came in to weigh her and my nurses helped me stand for the first time, took me to the bathroom, and taught me how to take care of my stitches and stuff.  

My nurses were amazing, my doctor was amazing, my hospital was amazing.  They provide 3 meals a day for mom and support person, and they provided a celebration dinner after.  We got steak, loaded potatoes, green beans, a bottle of sparkling grape juice, and an entire ""nothing bundt cake"". They did allow me to eat during labor until the epidural started and even after that they allowed me soda, coffee, water,  etc.  

The hospital also had soda, water, juice, and tons of snacks available to me and my husband the whole time. I was able to keep my energy up which I really think helped.  When I had my son 9 years ago I wasn't allowed to eat or drink the entire time, they washed and weighed him before giving him to me, they left me on my back the entire labor and didn't move me, and they gave me an episiotomy. Things have come a LONG way in ten years! 

Oh also my baby got donor milk the whole time we were in the hospital to supplement my colostrum.  With my son all they had was formula and they didn't offer it, you had to ask. 

So we're home now, a little over 48 hours out. My bleeding had mostly stopped after 24 hours and I'm only spotting now. I didn't bleed much after my son either though. I'm super swollen downstairs though and hoping the pain down there eases up. My girl is tongue and lip tied and my milk hasn't come in, so we are supplementing formula and taking it one step at a time. 

If you read this far, thank you! I hope this eases your fears a little. 

Feel free too AMA in comments and I'll answer the best I can. 

For reference I'm in the USA in the Midwest and gave birth at a hospital.

Background of the story: ABYG i am 8 months preggy, previously madaming bleeding episodes due to high levels of stress and home conflict for another story. During this phase, inaasikaso naman  kami ni baby ni hubby and super thankful ako for that na pati chores sya na lahat. Even yung ibang errands for my parents sya ang gumagawa. For work, i lie down on incline and rest my hips once in a while kasi ito talaga pinaka masakit. Hubs works mid shift and I work early morning shift. 

Nagclear na si OB last week na all goods na pwede na lumabas labas basta mag ingat lang, nag ask ako sa hubs ko if pwede ba ako lumabas sa malapit lang to see my friend? Yung pupuntahan is coffee shop and surely uupo lang ako, hindi bibili ng coffee coz bawal and likely kakain lang Aglio Olio. 

Conditions nya before if lalabas pag hindi sya makakasama is “may car, kasama bestfriend nya na as driver, malapit lang and hindi pa madilim” kapitbahay lang namin si bestfriend.

All conditions were met that day. Ok lang din kung no ang sagot kaso i felt offended na sabe nya ay “basta pag may nangyari sa inyo, labas ako jan” as if insinuating na maaccident kami ni baby. So nainis ako na huy bat ka nagsasalita ng ganyan instead of just saying no or ingat kayo ha.

For a while i ran errands for my mom kasama si bestfriend nya kasi no choice naman ako but to do it coz medical errand sya. 

He was saying na nagtantrums ako kasi hindi ako pinayagan pero no, mas nainis ako sa sinabi nya. he says hindi naman ganon ibig nyang sabihin. I will appreciate a no wag muna kasi hindi ako kasama or ingat kayo ha. 

I really am grateful sa pag asikaso nya samin ni baby pero nabuburn out din ako kasi ilang buwan na akong kulong sa kwarto kasi matarik ang stairs dito. 

Ako ba yung gago for wanting to go out?

1j12kx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1j12kx5/one_year_sober_what_i_learned_about_me/,One year sober - What I learned about me.,"Hi all,

I'm excited to be celebrating one year of complete abstinence from alcohol (and nicotine) today, after a 15+ year battle with daily dependence I didn't even know I was fighting (and losing).

At first I drank no fewer than 6 light beers an evening (24oz) and much more through the weekends. 2020 brought with it an opportunity to work from home which I parlayed into an opportunity to drink from morning to night - and I did that until February 29th, 2024 - which was the day I put myself in the hospital after an undiscovered variceal rupture almost killed me.

That was my first day without a drink in 15+ years.

\~

I was never a problematic drunk; I could be described as a functioning alcoholic. Software engineer with a great salary for a low cost of living area, home owner, retirement savings, no unsecured debt, couple of happy cats. Life was great. I had zero stress. I worked, drank, minded my hobbies, and answered to absolutely no one.

For most of that time I never felt a reason to stop, so I didn't. But the lucid moments when I wanted and tried to stop, I couldn't. I needed alcohol to treat the symptoms of alcohol cessation. I rationalized the reasons I couldn't get help to do it safely.

\~

The end of 2023 and early 2024 felt different. The need to quit emerged as though my body was encoding cries for help through my subconscious - I became aware through some innate, primal knowledge that I had to stop or I would soon die. This gave me enough strength to try, but by this time it was already too late.

\~

In the days leading up to hospitalization, I had been experiencing black, tarry stools, black coffee-ground-like vomit (both turned out to be blood from the variceal rupture), vision changes like light sensitivity and spots appearing, and on the morning I called 911 I experienced extreme weakness as though walking across my house were the equivalent energy expenditure of scaling Mount Everest (blood loss).

In an alternate timeline where I ignored those symptoms, this post does not exist because I am dead.

\~

Cirrhosis felt, at first, like a cheat way to quit alcohol. As though the fear of dying makes it easy to abstain.

It doesn't. Many others like me exist now in that other timeline. In my own experience, I wanted to stop before consciously knowing there was a diagnosis to necessitate it. What I finally gave myself was an opportunity to do it safely by putting myself in a hospital. The reasons behind my drinking still remained and would still challenge me greatly. The difference now is that I'm forced to face those reasons or die. The relative distance between that choice and its consequences merely clarified the simplicity of it.

In retrospect, it would have been *much* easier to know this 15 years ago. 

Which brings me to the past year and what I've learned about **myself**.

* I have an issue with avoidance coping and escapism. I used alcohol to avoid dealing with negative emotions. Alcohol numbed my emotions and generally elevated them to a positive, even keel - through the neurophysiological effects of alcohol on the brain. It artificially made me feel confident, happy, and stress-free.
* Because of this, I had spent 15 years not developing the healthy, mature emotional management skills that build the character I had enjoyed renting all those years.
* Sobriety suddenly putting me back in touch with the human condition was jarring and hard to process. It is **critical** for me to understand that a desire to drink is actually a desire to avoid dealing with negative emotions, and that the way forward is not to try resolving the issue with alcohol, but to learn how to be ok with negative emotions, process them healthily, and experience life the way I rationally want to, in spite of them.

Over the past year my mind instinctually tried to fill the hole alcohol left behind. This came through as addictive behaviors. Soothing mechanisms. Avoidance. 

The three points above have helped me reframe the problem, and I'm happy to say I have no cravings for alcohol nor nicotine any more. Not even fleetingly. I do, however, still have a lot of work to do learning how to deal with emotions in a healthy way, but what lifted such a large part of that burden was this simple fact:

It's totally normal.

And because of that, I am not alone.

\~

Thank you for reading this. I wish you well on your journey, and hope to see you smiling with me on the other side of it.

What if you saw a disturbing glimpse of your future in a dream, and no matter how hard you tried to avoid it, you ended up causing it to happen?

Well, It happened to me. And I'd like to share it with you.

First a little background:
I was just a 12 year old kid, before the advent of cell phones, streaming media, or even the internet for that matter, I didn’t know much about the ‘paranormal’ and things of that nature. No, my biggest pursuits were comic books, collecting Hot Wheels cars, and supporting my video game addiction over at the local arcade.
  
The year was 1978.
  
Anyway, so I got this little weekend job down at the swap meet (about two blocks from my house) helping out this old Chinese vendor named Chung. The job was simple; meet Chung at the Drive-in theater early Saturday and Sunday morning to help set up his vendor stall with merchandise consisting of knock-off Gucci bags, pocketbooks, and assorted women’s shoes, then assisting him throughout the day. At the end of the day Chung would hand me a nice crispy $10.00 bill. 
  
I was making 20 bucks a week, which in 1978 afforded me the latest issues of Mad Magazine and collectible Hot Wheels, as well as a shot at that new video game over at the arcade called ‘Space Invaders’.
  
On one Friday night I sat on the edge of my bed, reached over to my nightstand and picked up my little alarm clock to set it for work the next morning. Swap meet vendors had to be there early so that they could set up and be ready to meet the throngs of shoppers coming in at 7:00 when the ticket gates opened.
  
My alarm clock was an old vintage wind-up handed down to me from my grandmother. It had a round face and two little bells on top that would ring when the hour hand reached the third hand, (also known as the ‘alarm hand’). I set the alarm hand for 5:30, wound the clock spring, and placed it back on my nightstand. I prided myself on being on time…a characteristic that was instilled in me from the time I learned to work for my own money.
  
I was an industrious young man of morals and integrity. I had the world by the horns… or so I thought.
  
I put my pajamas on and laid my work clothes out on a chair, then tucked myself in for the night. I must have slept extremely well that night. We’re talking deep R.E.M. sleep. The kind where time seems to no longer exist. Then I had a lucid dream. A very unsettling lucid dream. It went something like this:
  
I’m walking through a door, and there, about 30 to 35 feet in front of me was my boss, Chung, squatting down in front of his vendor stall that was completely set up, with purses and handbags hanging from hooks on the shade structure. His display tables were adorned with colorful tablecloths, loaded with pocketbooks, coin purses and other accessories. 
  
He was straightening a pair of red shoes he had arranged on the tarmac up front. I had missed setup. I was suddenly flushed with the realization that I was late for work. That feeling of pure anxiety washed over me like a bucket of ice cold water.
  
I stood shocked and dumbfounded as Chung looked over his shoulder and spotted me. He nodded his head with a grin and started to speak. But the sound that came out was not that of his voice, but a loud, steady ringing sound. The sound of a bell.
  
Suddenly I was ripped from my dream, and I bolted upright in bed to the sound of my alarm clock going off. It was 5:30 and time to get ready for work. I reached over and turned it off, then rubbed my eyes, anxious with that feeling of being late that lingered with repeating visions from that stupid dream. 
  
I felt like I had just closed my eyes only to be rudely awakened again. I shrugged it off and went to the bathroom to begin my morning ritual for work. 
  
But the dream kept replaying itself over and over in my head like a 10-second video clip stuck on a loop. The finished displays. The red shoes. The grin on Chung’s face. The feeling of being late. And what the hell was he about to say just before my alarm clock jolted me out of it? I just couldn’t shake it despite the fact that I had gotten up on time and there was nothing keeping me from getting to work on time that morning. 
  
Nonetheless, I picked up my pace a little bit just to make sure that dream playing out over and over again, and that feeling of dread that comes with showing up late for work, would just go away.
  
I felt a bit silly as I donned my clothes a little quicker, and tied my old suede wallabies a little faster than I normally would. I slipped my wrist watch on and checked the time against my alarm clock for a match. “This is ludicrous”, I thought to myself. “There’s no way I can be late. If anything I’ll be super early.”
  
I cut the time I would normally spend getting ready to go to work in half by skipping breakfast, and set out on foot at 10 minutes to 6 in the chilly morning darkness toward the Drive-in theater that waited for me about a block and a half away from my house. 
  
The light of dawn wouldn’t break for another half-hour or so. And, as it has been all season, my job was to show up around 6:30 a.m., meet Chung at our usual spot, and we would knock out the setup by 7:00…just in time for the shoppers to be allowed in. 
  
But this time it would be “a little bit different” I thought to myself as I shuffled down my empty street toward the quiet four lane thoroughfare.  Ignoring the crosswalk, I jogged across the thoroughfare toward the main gate of the Drive-in theater with its landmark forty-foot screen looming in the distance. 
  
The dream quickened my pace. I scoffed and fought the urge to break into a run. 
  
It was unusually foggy that morning too. As I made my way through the shadows I couldn’t help but notice the ominous looking halos of swirling mist surrounding each street lamp. The theme song from ‘The Twilight Zone’ kept trying to seep into the cracks in my overactive imagination. 
  
And that damn dream. That dream was still fresh on my mind as I entered the gate and waved at the security guard leaning in the door frame of his guard shack. He recognized me with a nod of his head, his face half-lit by one single incandescent light bulb from within. He pulled the cigarette from his lips with thumb and forefinger and let out a puff of thick, gray smoke. “Here a little early, arencha?” 
  
I shook my head and shoved my hands in my pockets as I thought about how ridiculous it was for me to be here at this hour. There was literally no one there except for the snack bar/café crew in the center of the Drive-in  lot. I headed straight for it. I needed to get my head on straight. I needed a cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed donut. 
  
I walked into the café and up to the service counter. The place was completely empty  except for those bleary-eyed workers who were busy doing their morning prep for the coming rush of customers. “Their day starts a lot earlier than mine”, I reckoned as I took in the aroma of fresh coffee and baked goods. 
  
I ordered my cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed with a $2 bill, and got two quarters change. I grabbed an Auto Trader magazine from a rack by the entrance and scanned the area for a good place to sit.
  
Through large windows I could see a panoramic view of the outside area. I spotted a booth and sat down from where I had an unobstructed view of our spot. I wanted to see Chung the moment he arrived so I could go out to greet him early. 
  
I felt so foolish as I stirred the sugar and powdered creamer into my cup, and chuckled to myself as the dream faded for now, my mind preoccupied by the taste of fresh coffee and the flavor of that old fashioned glazed delicacy. 
  
About halfway through my cup of coffee I glanced at my watch. It was 6:35 (about the time I would normally show up). By now the light of dawn was just beginning to illuminate the cloudless sky, and the fog that had invaded the early morning was gone. 
  
Vendors were rapidly arriving en masse, claiming their spots. The clinking and clanking of their shade structure poles reverberated throughout the Drive-in as the they got busy unloading their vehicles and setting up their vending stalls. 
  
Vendors began filing into the café to get their morning caffeine and sugar fix. I stared blankly at our spot. Empty. Was Chung running late? I knew that his commute was considerably longer. His old cargo van had seen better days. 
  
Something was not right. The spaces on either side of ours were already busy with vendors and their helpers skillfully fastening leg poles to corner pieces, and stretching canvas tarps with bungee cords for shade.
  
I stepped outside to use the payphone that was mounted on the wall next to the restrooms. I figured I’d call Chung at home to see if he was there. But the pay phone had an ‘Out of Order’ sign written in black marker taped across the coin slots. Go figure.
  
Back inside, I bought another cup of coffee with my last 50 cents. “Why not?” If Chung didn’t show up by the time I finished the second cup, I reasoned, then I guess he’d be considered a no-show. 
  
Heck, I could just go home and crawl back into bed for a couple more hours before the rest of my family started to rouse. Godzilla and Kung Fu reruns on Saturday morning. Yes, just what the doctor ordered. 
  
I looked over to our spot again. It was completely vacant, surrounded by a sea of shade structures, tarps, goods, with cargo vans, box trucks, and just about anything you could haul stuff in that had materialized across the tarmac of the Drive-in theater as far as the eye could see. 
  
If you’ve ever been to a swap meet you know what I’m talking about. It was now 7:00. It’s Showtime!
  
“Well, I guess that’s it”, I thought to myself as I stood up and drank the last sip from my coffee cup. Chung is a no-show. That whole dream was such a… well, it was just that…a dream. I was now free to go home and catch some shut eye, and to decompress from an otherwise stressful episode.
  
I headed for the exit on the other side of the now crowded café. Beyond it was my home less than 10 minutes away. 
  
Through the windows on that side I could see the shoppers starting to flow in from the ticket line and fan out through the isles of waiting vendors. 
  
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed it outward, and then I felt a strange rush kind of like 'Djv' come over me. 
  
“This can’t be…”, I struggled to reason, as I walked out the door and saw…him. It was the dream. Only this time, for real.
  
I gazed in existential horror at Chung who squatted about 35 feet right in front of me. He was straightening a pair of brightly polished red pumps on display on the tarmac…and I was late.
  
My jaw went slack as my coffee cup fell from numb fingers. “Chung?”
  
Chung looked over his shoulder in my direction. He had just finished setting up his stall. Every detail was there from the hanging handbags to the accessory tables and, well…you know the rest.
  
Chung’s gaze met mine; “Oh there you are!” He said with a sheepish grin, “Sorry, I forgot to tell you…I switched spots!”

Hey all, I'm a '40F' been with my partner 13 years but not married, he's never cheated on me as far as I know, but I get insecure from time to time. He '58M' had female friends when he was ALOT younger that he had sex with, so when he gets a female friend I start worrying! 

8 years ago I had a very bad spell of paranoia and am amazed we made it through that 😭 and I can feel myself going there again. 

He has a female friend he often goes over to hers for coffee, and I asked him tonight if she made a move on you would you say no?

My husband bought a car that is a manual transmission; I do not know how to drive a manual transmission. I get one day a week in town - Saturday - to do any kind of in-person shopping. 

The move this month was Hell; it cost thousands and thousands of dollars and nearly my sanity. In the past two weeks I've had: (1) an infected tooth requiring an emergency root canal; (2) Norovirus; (3) laryngitis. I had ordered a lunchbox on Amazon because he talked about wanting one. The first seller canceled (and the emergency dental work in a foreign country sucked up all of my money), so I had to wait to re-order even though I hated waiting because I knew it wouldn't get here in time. I was tapped out and he knew it; I maxed out all of my cards to get here and drained my savings thanks to the emergency dental work. 

Friday before his birthday, mid-day he texts that he's going home sick. He also tells me I need to drop what I'm doing right now and go to the grocery store with him before 5 pm or we won't get anything this weekend because he doesn't want to call out sick and then be seen around town. I say no, I can't cancel my entire roster of afternoon client calls. 

This morning, I wake up at 9 am. He is awake, playing Playstation with his brother online. He doesn't say anything to me as I make coffee, only to ask me if I am making a quad shot for him - I say, ""didn't you already have one?"", confused and pointing to his cup. He just grumbles, ""nevermind"". I go into my office to drink my coffee because his yelling at his video game is something I hate being around.

I expect he is going to log off soon - almost two hours go by, still playing. I like a Facebook status about his birthday, then go to the couch and say ""happy birthday"" in his language and kiss his forehead. I try to get his attention so I can give him his gift. He keeps playing. I give up and send him a screenshot of what it is. He doesn't care. Instead, he sends me a long text that says ""don't turn this into a fight, but..."" and then goes on to accuse me of forgetting his birthday, says if I remembered then I would have dropped everything to go shopping yesterday, and then ends it with ""I guess it really depends on how we are raised how magical you make someone else's birthday"".

I got pissed. I told him that, if he wasn't so busy playing video games all morning, he might have noticed me waiting for him to be done so I could give him the only gift I could get this year, that he made it clear he'd rather spend the day playing with his brother, and told him to have a nice day with his family since he thinks they are all so much better than me and ""how I was raised"". I told him he finds a reason to hate his birthday every single year and that I am never celebrating birthdays with him again after this.

She is an international student. We met on a friends app and clicked in the beginning, I talked about how much I love to travel, she's new to the city and how I'd love to show her around. (I'm in Prague, one of the world's most touristy cities) 

And so that happens. I take her around to the usual places. We catch up quite often, we send reels everyday and chat all the time. I don't have netflix, but she does so we meet up do watch series on her account. 

Fast forward as time goes by, she picked up a new retail job, and we start hanging out less and less over time . And now it's gotten to the point where she is only interested in doing touristy things and not casual catchups anymore. 

I guess it doesn't resonate with me bc to me friends are about people and spending time with them, doesn't matter what you do. You just like the person and enjoy their company. 

She won't even catch up over simple things anymore like just a coffee, because we haven't seen each other in ages. The focus is shifted more towards the activity than the person. It always has to be a new experience or unique every time we catch up or she'll get bored. 

She lost interest in a lot of things we used to connect on like art, movies, music. 

And to only want to do sightseeing, I kinda feel used and I'm not really a tourist guide, I want a best friend who cares about me for me and not my knowledge of the city, travels. It was also getting expensive as she wants to go new museums, bars and stuff all the time she's never been.  

I put a lot of effort into her. i've introduced her to my current friend group. Last year I planned a surprise birthday party, invited her to Christmas at mine so she wouldn't be alone. (I always ask what her plans are and she usually doesn't do anything) 

She does appreciate it though. Though I don't feel like it's reciprocated back. She doesn't make time or effort to catch up with me anymore. She does stuff (new things) on her own. 

I also feel there's only so much you can see in my city, you will run out of things at some point. 

Her visa ends soon so she might have to go back to her country. I've never felt so close to a person or had a best friend in my life. I feel so lost. I feel I'm losing her. 

I've been more in to fitness and running recently since I'm not going out that much. I started a new Bachelors degree this year. ",3,1740843748.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

But she wakes up again and something is different.,"A green flash filled the room in Godric's Hollow. For a second, all that existed was that blinding brightness  and then, suddenly, everything blurred. Lily’s mind plunged into total and complete darkness... just for a moment.  

When she woke up, Lily Potter found herself in a bed that wasn’t hers, in a room that felt entirely unfamiliar. She sat up, disoriented, her legs trembling like jelly. Her head throbbed as if someone had hit her with several Stunning Spells in quick succession.  

It took a few seconds for her to notice the strange feeling in her body. Her limbs felt longer, her frame taller than she remembered. Panic rising, Lily spotted a mirror in the corner of the room. She tried to run toward it but stumbled, barely catching herself before falling.  

When her eyes finally landed on the reflection, her breath caught in her throat. Confusion and disbelief swelled within her, and she whispered one word:  

""Tuney?""  

Desperately, Lily touched her face, tracing her features to confirm what she was seeing.  

At that moment, the door creaked open, and a tall, heavyset man stepped inside.  

""Petunia,Thank God, I was worried,"" Vernon Dursley said, his voice laced with concern.""When I woke up, you were still asleep, and when I tried to wake you to make coffee, you were burning up with fever. I was about to take you to the hospital."" 

Lily or rather, Petunia went ghostly pale. Her face lost all expression, eyes wide with horror. Seeing her reaction, Vernon shifted uneasily.  

""Pet?"" he asked, voice quieter this time. ""Are you okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.""

I hope this will be helpful !
My journey started with “ Can I even pass the exam ?,Can I even make it through the prep phase?”and yea with the help of my supporting family and realllyyy great friends , I PASSED STEP ONE 😁
How I studied -
My primary resource- Boards and beyond -I heard each and every video for step one and downloaded the pdfs from the website and annotated alot as in I didn’t feel the necessity to listen to them again.
Boards and beyond is a veryyyyy good resource-it helped me build concepts like crazily.
Uworld - I solved questions and reviewed 80 questions in one day which was very difficult in the beginning but got used to later - what I did was made my own flash cards and highlighted the points 
First aid - I used to read the bnb pdfs and then read first aid - my life got easier by doing that 
So Format for each chapter -
1ST BOARDS AND BEYOND 
2ND FIRST AID
3RD UWORLD My Uworld average - 71%
And to complete all my chapters it took me 3 and a half months excluding breaks !
Then I had to repeat the entire process one more time - did around 3-4 times of revision.
1 and a half month into exam date - I started doing NBMES - I did all offline , time management was a very big thing for me - it took me around 1 hr 15 min per block , as I did all of them offline , I had to practice 40 questions every day just to increase my speed.And I did mehlman pdfs very selected chapters.
Scores - 26-71%,27-74%,28-75%,29-77%,30-79%,31-82%
Free120-67% 
UWSA2-64%
UWSA3-61%
UWSA1-71%
THE REAL EXAM - WAS SIMILAR TO UWORLD AND NOT NBMES 
AND I DIDNOT GET A SINGLE QUESTION FROM SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FROM BIOSTATS ,ethics I got around 4-5 or even less in each block.
EXAM DAY EXPERIENCE- I took a break of 6-7 min between blocks , I used washroom irrespective of the urge to urinate - this tip helped me alot ( my friend suggested me ),drank some nice iced coffee my mum made, ate protein bars and fruits. I didn’t eat proper lunch, please think of each block as if you are writing a new exam , don’t let your previous block affect your current block !Even in the real exam time wasn’t sufficient for me especially for last 3 blocks last 5-10 questions, I really have to improve my time management skills!

1j125ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1j125ll/unlock_the_hidden_health_benefits_of_white_coffee/,Unlock the Hidden Health Benefits of White Coffee!,"# Introduction

White coffee is gaining popularity among coffee lovers and health enthusiasts alike. Unlike regular coffee, white coffee is roasted at a lower temperature, preserving more of its natural nutrients and offering a smoother, nuttier flavor. But did you know that this unique brew also comes with a range of surprising health benefits?

In this article, we’ll uncover the hidden health benefits of white coffee, explain how it differs from regular coffee, and why it might be the perfect addition to your daily routine.





# What is White Coffee?

White coffee is made from the same coffee beans as regular coffee, but the roasting process is what sets it apart. Here’s how it differs:

· **Lower Roasting Temperature** – White coffee is roasted at approximately 325°F (163°C), whereas regular coffee is roasted at around 450°F (232°C).

· **Lighter Color and Nutty Flavor** – The lower roasting temperature results in a pale, beige-colored coffee with a distinct nutty taste.

· **Higher Caffeine Content** – Since it undergoes less roasting, white coffee retains more caffeine than regular coffee.

Now that you know what white coffee is, let’s dive into its impressive health benefits.





# 1. Higher Antioxidant Levels

White coffee retains more antioxidants than regular coffee due to its lighter roast. Antioxidants help:

✅ Reduce oxidative stress in the body✅ Combat free radicals that cause aging and diseases✅ Support a healthy immune system

A higher antioxidant intake is linked to lower risks of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.





# 2. Boosts Energy and Mental Alertness

White coffee has more caffeine than regular coffee, making it an excellent choice for those needing a strong energy boost. The benefits include:

☕ Increased focus and concentration☕ Enhanced cognitive function☕ Reduced fatigue and sluggishness

If you need a morning pick-me-up, white coffee is a great alternative to traditional coffee.





# 3. Supports Metabolism and Weight Loss

Caffeine plays a key role in boosting metabolism, and since white coffee has a higher caffeine content, it can help:

��Increase calorie burning��Enhance fat oxidation��Improve exercise performance

If you’re looking to support weight loss naturally, switching to white coffee may be beneficial.





# 4. Gentler on the Stomach

Many people experience acid reflux or digestive discomfort from regular coffee due to its high acidity. White coffee, however, has lower acidity, which means:

✔️ Less irritation to the stomach lining✔️ Reduced risk of acid reflux and heartburn✔️ Smoother digestion

This makes white coffee a great choice for those with sensitive stomachs.





# 5. Supports Heart Health

Drinking white coffee in moderation may contribute to better heart health by:

❤️ Reducing inflammation❤️ Supporting healthy blood circulation❤️ Lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases

Its antioxidant properties also help prevent damage to blood vessels.





# 6. May Help Control Blood Sugar Levels

Some studies suggest that coffee can play a role in regulating blood sugar. White coffee’s compounds may:

��Improve insulin sensitivity��Help lower blood sugar levels��Reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes

For those looking to manage their blood sugar naturally, white coffee could be a beneficial option.





# 7. Enhances Mood and Reduces Stress

Caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine and serotonin, the brain’s “feel-good” chemicals. Drinking white coffee may:

��Improve mood and reduce anxiety��Lower the risk of depression��Provide a mental relaxation effect

A cup of white coffee can be a great way to start your day on a positive note!





# 8. Rich in Essential Nutrients

White coffee preserves more nutrients than dark-roasted coffee. It contains:

✔️ Magnesium – Supports muscle and nerve function✔️ Potassium – Helps regulate blood pressure✔️ Niacin – Promotes healthy skin and digestion

These nutrients contribute to overall well-being and energy production.





# How to Brew White Coffee for Maximum Benefits

To enjoy the full benefits of white coffee, here’s how to prepare it properly:

1️⃣ **Use a Fine Grind** – White coffee beans are denser and harder than regular beans, so they require a special grinder.2️⃣ **Brew Using Espresso or Drip Coffee Maker** – Due to its hardness, white coffee is best brewed using an espresso machine or a drip coffee maker.3️⃣ **Experiment with Milk and Sweeteners** – White coffee has a naturally nutty taste, so adding almond or oat milk enhances its flavor.





# White Coffee vs. Regular Coffee: Which is Better?

||
||
|**Feature**|**White Coffee**|**Regular Coffee**|
|**Roast Level**|Light Roast|Medium to Dark Roast|
|**Caffeine Content**|Higher|Lower|
|**Acidity**|Lower|Higher|
|**Flavor**|Nutty, Mild|Bold, Bitter|
|**Nutrient Retention**|More Antioxidants|Fewer Antioxidants|

If you’re looking for a healthier, less acidic, and more energizing coffee option, white coffee is worth trying.





# Potential Side Effects of White Coffee

While white coffee has many benefits, it’s essential to consume it in moderation. Some possible side effects include:

⚠️ Jitters or restlessness due to higher caffeine content⚠️ Increased heart rate in caffeine-sensitive individuals⚠️ Difficulty sleeping if consumed too late in the day

To avoid these issues, limit your intake to one or two cups per day.





# Conclusion

White coffee isn’t just a trendy new coffee—it’s a powerhouse of health benefits! With higher antioxidants, increased caffeine, and lower acidity, it provides an excellent alternative to regular coffee. Whether you’re looking to boost your energy, improve digestion, or support heart health, white coffee is worth adding to your daily routine.

So, why not give white coffee a try and unlock its hidden health benefits today?

I just delivered my first order of the day. It was a S/D - $40 - 20 items. I had about 9 bags because it was cleaning supplies and coffee and boxes of creamers. 

I arrived and there was a large white dog on the porch looking scared and timid- pacing back and forth. I opened my car door and was talking to him real sweet and it was not bothering me. I very carefully put three bags at the far end of their 40 foot long covered porch so as to give the dog as much space as possible. 

I get back to my car, about 25 feet from the porch. I grab the next 6 bags and proceed to turn around and this mother fucker opens his front door and proceeds to let a very aggressive Schnauzer/pointer type breed out who fucking charges at me, hair standing up on its back growling and barking. The dude just stands there watching this happen. I start yelling at the guy to get his dogs, and just stands there. I had to crawl into the back of my outback guarding my body with the bags. I start screaming at him to grab his dogs. 

I finally said come on man I will put these back in my car, call the cops and return everything to Walmart. 

He casually walks over and says, oh sorry, I thought you were my daughter that’s only reason I let them out. He grabs his dog and takes them back to the house.

Five year relationship. As we were practically kids when we got together, I would spend a lot of time around his family and vice versa, practically grew up with these people.

We split many years ago. No kids, no ties. But I’ve always stayed in contact with his mum, not by meeting up but just by a few messages here and there, birthday wishes etc. But recently I was out to dinner with my friends and on the table near us was my ex and his parents. It’s been a long while since I saw them all together and didn’t know whether to go over and say hi or not, I chose not to in the end. I could see his mum was looking at me from time to time, so I messaged and apologised for not saying hi. She then said she and her husband are moving far away soon and would I like to meet up for coffee. 

Long story short, we met yesterday and chatted for about 5 hours, it was so so lovely. It felt like no time had passed and I was that little teenager again talking to her mother in law. We have arranged to meet up again next week as she feels sad that they are moving and that her and I have only just started meeting.

Disclaimer: I have a partner of 6 years, my ex has a new partner too. My ex and I never had bad blood (even though we probably should have) and we would chat if we ever bumped into each other. As soon as he got a new girlfriend he blocked me. I feel fine about that, it doesn’t affect my life and I know that relationships need boundaries. My partner is amazing, loving and supportive, and really is my ride or die. I can’t help but feel guilty about meeting with someone from my past like this though.

I know it’s not like I’m meeting with the actual ex, but in today’s society it feels like there is a stigma against having contact with your ex/ex’s family unless children are involved. I see her as a friend and vice versa, we always got along well. Her son was not even brought up. So is this wrong of me? I will likely never see her again when she moves.

Coffee name: Shantawene

Growing altitude: 1900-2300m

Origin: Ethiopia, Sidama

Producer: Daye Bensa

Variety: Heirloom

Processing: Anaerobic

Flavor notes according to roaster: Passion fruit, strawberry, round

Roasted: 06.02.2025 - vacuumed and frozen about 10 days after roasting date


Ground with: Kingrinder K6

Covered with:  Swirl only at the end


In: 16

Out: 250

Sec: 2:40

Temp: 95


Taste and experience:
A beautiful and very bright bean with an intense aroma reminiscent of strawberry, with fermentation notes also shining through. The beans are tolerant during preparation - no brew was ultimately undrinkable. The roast has a lovely sweetness that blends perfectly with a tangy acidity. It can definitely be associated with passion fruit. For me, it sometimes tends more towards sweet rhubarb, as the sweetness clearly shines through in the background. In general, however, I would stick to the description of the roastery. I was particularly taken with the extremely long-lasting aftertaste. After swallowing, you can almost be sure that after 3-4 seconds a completely new and intense sweetness will suddenly spread through your mouth. I've never had anything like it, so this is probably the best bean of the still young year.

Basically, the grind size feature overrides all settings and continuously moves the grind size scale left and right, indicating a possible glitch.

Breville replaced it without any issues, but this time, I haven’t heard from them so far. Hopefully, they will reach out after the weekend.

1j11uah,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1j11uah/are_the_children_and_spouses_overreacting_about/,Are the children and spouses overreacting about the toxic MIL/FIL behavior?,"I posted this in another reddit, but I would love to hear from the highly esteemed Potato Community. <3

Obligatory statement that this is a throwaway account as the details will give me away, but I just don't want this attached to my personal Reddit.

I (F 30s) have been with my husband M (M 30s) for almost a decade, married for the majority of it, with two small children. M has one brother ""BIL"" (M 30s) that is married to ""SIL"" (F 30s) and have been together quite a bit longer but do not have children currently.

I've always had some issues with MIL, mainly after I got pregnant with my first child. It was like her personality completely changed. She had issues with my family members and was extremely rude to them, acted inappropriately towards children not even related to her at my baby shower, and became extremely controlling in certain aspects. It only got worse once I gave birth. To give you an idea: once she knew that I hadn't eaten all day and woke the baby up right when she saw I had finished heating up my food to eat. I was breastfeeding at the time and had to stop what I was doing to go feed the baby. I was also very obviously going through major post-partum depression at the time (it was evident in my actions and it had been spoken about). When I wasn't able to visit them at their camp with M and our only baby at the time and there was a ""first"" that I wanted to be a part of, MIL wanted to do it anyway and said ""What OneLoneSockLeft doesn't know won't hurt her."" Woke the baby up from a nap while we were visiting after she knew I had battled to get him to nap. Gave him coffee without asking. Many, many more things along those lines. I always dealt with these things silently because I didn't want to cause waves. Little did I know we were all feeling some type of way...

When we told MIL and FIL that I was pregnant with our second child, FIL was excited but MIL barely smiled and didn't seem very excited. When she found out we were having a girl this time? Not excited at all. I thought I was just overreacting or looking too much into it, so I never said anything to anyone. However, they NEVER want to take my daughter with them when they take my son. They ask to take my son for a week at a time but never seem to want to take my daughter. This has been pointed out to them by an aunt, and they just brush it off.

Last year, they decided to sell their house and live permanently at their camper (permanent set up) in PA during the spring/summer and down at another camper in FL the rest of the year. Around the time they were selling their house, my BIL found out that he was battling stage 4 cancer. They still made him help move all of the stuff in their house, multiple times. When SIL tried to say they needed to get home, MIL said ""Oh you can go, BIL can stay and help!"" He was going through chemo at the time. Not only that, but they barely checked in on BIL. BIL and SIL would only hear from them when they wanted something, then would ask how he was as an afterthought. But don't you know it, she was Mom of the Year when she actually went to an appointment or two. She tried to tell SIL she didn't need to go to the appointments...yet SIL has been the rock of the entire situation. She even told M and I not to ask BIL about what was going on WITH HIS OWN CANCER because he didn't know and she could tell us better. What?

All of the extra stuff from their house? Stored at BIL and SIL's house because they were local. They did NOTHING with the items during the summer. FIL picked up some odd jobs to do so he stayed busy with work, but he would stay at BIL and SIL's house a few nights a week (without bothering to let them know, despite being asked), but MIL did NOTHING all day at the campground. BIL and SIL had to tell them to get their stuff out before they headed south for the winter. MIL and FIL are still having stuff shipped to BIL and SIL's house (WITHOUT ASKING) and just expecting them to hold it for them until they're back up north.

MIL and FIL also make comments about our parenting. It's all gotten back to us. Keep in mind: my kids only see them maybe three times a year. They are the ""fun grandparents"", not the ""there everyday or even once a week"" kind of grandparents. They also apparently talked about how M and I never came to visit...we both work 45 hours a week and live 4 hours away with them, while raising a young family...they're retired. They made no effort to come see the kids but expected us to completely uproot our busy lives for them.

In October they wanted to come pick up my son and take him up to camp for a few days before M and I would head up with our daughter for the early Halloween weekend. M had plans he could not miss that weekend, and I ended up having to work. This is the ONLY reason why MIL asked if she could pick up daughter as well then. M and I said we would rather her not go, as it would be her first time walking and trick or treating and we wanted to be there for that. MIL said ""it isn't worth it"" to just get my son, so they decided not to have him at all. Her excuse was it was too much driving before they went to FL. We had agreed to meet them halfway, and they didn't even leave for Florida for another two weeks. (She lied to us about when they were leaving.)

In November/December once they were down in FL, they called and asked if she could fly up, take our son on his first plane ride down to FL, and keep him for two weeks. This is the same woman who said a two hour drive was not worth spending time with her grandson. We said we would think about it, but we obviously did NOT let that happen. M and I talked and realized they would have done something like taken him to Disney World and not told us until after the fact. When we said we don't know if we would be okay with that long of time anyway, she said it wouldn't be worth it for just a week. Again, there's her saying my kids aren't worth it.

Oh, and just to add, the two hour drive before wasn't worth it for my kid, and a flight to spend a week with my kid isn't worth it, but it was DEFINITELY worth it when they flew from PA to FL for a cruise during their time up north. Make it make sense.

MIL was recently in the hospital. Admitted to the hospital, had to have a biopsy/surgery. We didn't know until DAYS after she had been admitted, and FIL lied to his sister J (LOVE this aunt, she is so sweet and caring and has been so understanding about what MIL and FIL have been putting us all through) saying that we knew she was in the hospital. He told us immediately after talking to J. Then they LIED about when she was released from the hospital. Flat out said a different date. No idea why.

The latest: FIL's birthday was this week and we all reached out via Facebook or text to wish him a happy birthday. Keep in mind: we have never really called on birthdays. I know M hasn't received a birthday call from them in a while, and I never have. BIL is lucky if they even bother to get ahold of him; usually he doesn't hear from them for months. Well, apparently this wasn't enough for MIL. She texted M and BIL and said she was disappointed in them for not calling their father. And this seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back. M didn't respond because he's at the point where he's like ""screw them"", but BIL is RIGHTFULLY fed up and done. All of us are questioning if we are even going to bother to go to camp at all this summer.

We don't expect anything out of them; if that is the retired life they want, that's fine! We are just tired of them acting like they are parents or grandparents of the year when really all they want is to seem like it without doing any of the work. At this point, I don't think we are overreacting for keeping our distance.

Edit: I forgot to mention! To this day, they will still bring up how M caused the house fire that destroyed their house over ten years ago. Because he had his truck plugged in. Sounds more like something wrong with the house's wiring, but she has brought it up numerous times over the years.",13,1740842607.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,0.84,False

1j11tjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1j11tjm/simply_be/,Simply Be,"If we knew our end was near,  
Would we choose a different path?  
Would we cling to every moment, searching for the good?  
Or would we run away from it all, drowning in our sorrow?  
Or perhaps, the only thing we could really do −  
Is to carry on as always,  
And simply be.

Simply  
Wake up in the morning and put on our socks,  
Drink our coffee and brush our teeth,  
Give a kiss and say goodbye,  
Get in the car and move on with the day.

And outside,  
The sun also rises, the roads are still loud,  
The birds keep on singing, the prices still climb.  
And maybe tomorrow we won’t be at all, but no one will know.  
The world keeps spinning, unchanged, as before.

So does it really matter?  
If we die tomorrow,  
Or maybe next week?  
In just a moment,  
Or in fifty years?  
Death −  
Is the same death.  
And life −  
Is the same life,  
For as long as it lasts.

And so, all that’s left for us to do −  
Is to live until we don’t,  
And in the meantime −  
Simply be.

Nah, bro. If hard work paid off, construction workers, janitors, and factory labourers would live the good life. But no, that ain't how it is. Hard work ain't worth squat if you ain't working smart. CEOs are sitting in the air-conditioned offices, taking 100 more than the suckers sweating it out in the trenches. Connections, birthright, luck—all that means more than working 24/7. It's wild. Sure, gifted people have more opportunities because they are extremely talented at something or were born into the right situation. Meanwhile, the rest of us toil away for years, hoping to master some skill to struggle on the edge. Do you expect someone born without legs to win a race? Do you wish to be wealthier than that fellow who won the lottery? Heck no. Good luck, contacts, and timing – what propels you, not how hard you grind. The harder you work, the faster you burn out. And when you're burned out, everything collapses. People out here faking like working yourself to death is the answer, but end up wrecking your mental health and body in the process. Those so-called genetically gifted people? They build abs very young and keep their muscle even when sick because that is their boy’s default fitness level. In the meantime, someone who has been in the gym for 20 years gets sick for weeks and loses it all. All the hard work is for nothing. It's unpleasant, but so many things in life are just luck. Your height, abs, and natural talent are all determined the second you breathe. I can't do anything about it. And don't even get me started about how life can turn around in a split second. The dude working 12 hours daily flipping burgers is his most challenging, but is he getting blitzed? No. And some influencer posts a picture of her coffee and makes more money in one hour than this dude makes in a year. Hard work? Nah, bro, it's all about Hard LUCK. The real kicker is that hustle culture has turned us into machines that never stop grinding, but all that time spent hustling isn't gonna get you anywhere. People act like you're doing it wrong if you're not working yourself into a coma. You'll see the same people crying tears of burnout because they've overworked themselves to the point of no return, trying to manifest that ""perfect life"" built on chance and timing. We're all trapped in a game where the rules are against us. Don't be fooled into thinking hard work is the golden pass. The game's not about outworking the system but surviving it. The whole ""grind nonstop"" attitude is just making people miserable. TL;DR: Success is not always about working hard. Luck, genetics, and timing are WAY MORE critical in the 24/7 world. People treat you like you're lazy if you're not working 24/7, but working hard doesn't always equal success. It's who you know and what you're born with.

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s to early 30s ideally please.  I want to hear from women that have a good level of maturity

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants looking around museums visiting  a nice beach and walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future 

I am a complete virgin and I’ve been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well this is what I’m looking for to get to know someone really well 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it on here because I don't like the word and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that would be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way. 

I love salmon my favourite fish and I love avocados they are so good for the skin. I love having nice burgers out and I also make my own from scratch smash burgers making your own is the best way at home. I love Italian food pasta and pizza the proper stuff being close to Italy we get a lot of the authentic Italian food here. 

I love Indian food too curries for me are probably my favourite food out of them all I don’t think you can beat this type of food when it’s done properly. Fish and chips proper English style would also be a favourite of mine. 

Burgers I love five guys and shake shack we had Both of these when I lived in the UK. In France we have five guys but I also love Burger King I love the flame grilled burgers 

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

I don't look my age we all look younger in my family we have strong genes in the family and  most say that I look like i am In my late 20s to early 30s I have a young looking face no grey hair at all and a full head of hair I'm not losing My hair at all 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings either and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery.

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear any heavy makeup fake tan fake nails fake eyelashes and fake hair and nails. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort ",1,1740842277.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Dan: “The other day, I badly misjudged my commute to work and overdid it on the coffee. Stuck in stop and go traffic on I-90 with another 30 minutes to go, I knew I wasn't going to make it. So I pulled an executive maneuver, dumping my coffee out the window and using the cup to relieve myself. Normally, I think this is grounds for throwing a cup away, but this was a nice Stanley tumbler I had just gotten for my birthday, so I triple washed it and put it back into rotation. Do I need to let my wife know the cup has been tainted just so she knows to avoid it?”


Ah, the precious Stanley tumbler I’ve heard so much about. You can fetch a pretty penny for one of those out on the black market! I’ve made some appalling confessions in this column, but here’s a surprise for you: I’ve never re-used a cup/bottle I’ve pissed in. It’s true. I’ve prepared food in mixing bowls that my kids have barfed in. I’ve blown my nose with printer paper. I’ve even had to unclog a toilet with my bare hands. I’m not scared to get my hands dirty.

So you might think I broke the “drinking out of a pisscup” seal long ago. Alas, I haven’t. Whenever I’ve had to piss in an emergency, I’ve either done it into a disposable receptacle or, of course, directly onto the ground. If I ever had to piss into my own travel cup for lack of other options, I’d do so. But would I reuse that travel mug? A difficult, and strangely erotic, question. Knowing me, the answer is PROBABLY. After all, if I cleaned the cup thoroughly, it’s back to just being a cup. My piss didn’t hide in the crawlspace and then pop back out when the coast was clear. It’s gone from premises, and therefore I can drink freely. I just wouldn’t tell anyone.

My wife included. Dan, don’t tell your wife that you pissed in the Stanley mug. She’ll make you toss it out and buy another one, and then you’ll be out a cool $30. A fate worse than drinking piss!",1,1740842148.0,doughboys,0,0.67,False

I (F 30s) have been with my husband M (M 30s) for almost a decade, married for the majority of it, with two small children. M has one brother ""BIL"" (M 30s) that is married to ""SIL"" (F 30s) and have been together quite a bit longer but do not have children currently.

I've always had some issues with MIL, mainly after I got pregnant with my first child. It was like her personality completely changed. She had issues with my family members and was extremely rude to them, acted inappropriately towards children not even related to her at my baby shower, and became extremely controlling in certain aspects. It only got worse once I gave birth. To give you an idea: once she knew that I hadn't eaten all day and woke the baby up right when she saw I had finished heating up my food to eat. I was breastfeeding at the time and had to stop what I was doing to go feed the baby. I was also very obviously going through major post-partum depression at the time (it was evident in my actions and it had been spoken about). When I wasn't able to visit them at their camp with M and our only baby at the time and there was a ""first"" that I wanted to be a part of, MIL wanted to do it anyway and said ""What OneLoneSockLeft doesn't know won't hurt her."" Woke the baby up from a nap while we were visiting after she knew I had battled to get him to nap. Gave him coffee without asking. Many, many more things along those lines. I always dealt with these things silently because I didn't want to cause waves. Little did I know we were all feeling some type of way...

When we told MIL and FIL that I was pregnant with our second child, FIL was excited but MIL barely smiled and didn't seem very excited. When she found out we were having a girl this time? Not excited at all. I thought I was just overreacting or looking too much into it, so I never said anything to anyone. However, they NEVER want to take my daughter with them when they take my son. They ask to take my son for a week at a time but never seem to want to take my daughter. This has been pointed out to them by an aunt, and they just brush it off.

Last year, they decided to sell their house and live permanently at their camper (permanent set up) in PA during the spring/summer and down at another camper in FL the rest of the year. Around the time they were selling their house, my BIL found out that he was battling stage 4 cancer. They still made him help move all of the stuff in their house, multiple times. When SIL tried to say they needed to get home, MIL said ""Oh you can go, BIL can stay and help!"" He was going through chemo at the time. Not only that, but they barely checked in on BIL. BIL and SIL would only hear from them when they wanted something, then would ask how he was as an afterthought. But don't you know it, she was Mom of the Year when she actually went to an appointment or two. She tried to tell SIL she didn't need to go to the appointments...yet SIL has been the rock of the entire situation. She even told M and I not to ask BIL about what was going on WITH HIS OWN CANCER because he didn't know and she could tell us better. What?

All of the extra stuff from their house? Stored at BIL and SIL's house because they were local. They did NOTHING with the items during the summer. FIL picked up some odd jobs to do so he stayed busy with work, but he would stay at BIL and SIL's house a few nights a week (without bothering to let them know, despite being asked), but MIL did NOTHING all day at the campground. BIL and SIL had to tell them to get their stuff out before they headed south for the winter. MIL and FIL are still having stuff shipped to BIL and SIL's house (WITHOUT ASKING) and just expecting them to hold it for them until they're back up north.

MIL and FIL also make comments about our parenting. It's all gotten back to us. Keep in mind: my kids only see them maybe three times a year. They are the ""fun grandparents"", not the ""there everyday or even once a week"" kind of grandparents. They also apparently talked about how M and I never came to visit...we both work 45 hours a week and live 4 hours away with them, while raising a young family...they're retired. They made no effort to come see the kids but expected us to completely uproot our busy lives for them.

In October they wanted to come pick up my son and take him up to camp for a few days before M and I would head up with our daughter for the early Halloween weekend. M had plans he could not miss that weekend, and I ended up having to work. This is the ONLY reason why MIL asked if she could pick up daughter as well then. M and I said we would rather her not go, as it would be her first time walking and trick or treating and we wanted to be there for that. MIL said ""it isn't worth it"" to just get my son, so they decided not to have him at all. Her excuse was it was too much driving before they went to FL. We had agreed to meet them halfway, and they didn't even leave for Florida for another two weeks. (She lied to us about when they were leaving.)

In November/December once they were down in FL, they called and asked if she could fly up, take our son on his first plane ride down to FL, and keep him for two weeks. This is the same woman who said a two hour drive was not worth spending time with her grandson. We said we would think about it, but we obviously did NOT let that happen. M and I talked and realized they would have done something like taken him to Disney World and not told us until after the fact. When we said we don't know if we would be okay with that long of time anyway, she said it wouldn't be worth it for just a week. Again, there's her saying my kids aren't worth it.

Oh, and just to add, the two hour drive before wasn't worth it for my kid, and a flight to spend a week with my kid isn't worth it, but it was DEFINITELY worth it when they flew from PA to FL for a cruise during their time up north. Make it make sense.

MIL was recently in the hospital. Admitted to the hospital, had to have a biopsy/surgery. We didn't know until DAYS after she had been admitted, and FIL lied to his sister J (LOVE this aunt, she is so sweet and caring and has been so understanding about what MIL and FIL have been putting us all through) saying that we knew she was in the hospital. He told us immediately after talking to J. Then they LIED about when she was released from the hospital. Flat out said a different date. No idea why.

The latest: FIL's birthday was this week and we all reached out via Facebook or text to wish him a happy birthday. Keep in mind: we have never really called on birthdays. I know M hasn't received a birthday call from them in a while, and I never have. BIL is lucky if they even bother to get ahold of him; usually he doesn't hear from them for months. Well, apparently this wasn't enough for MIL. She texted M and BIL and said she was disappointed in them for not calling their father. And this seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back. M didn't respond because he's at the point where he's like ""screw them"", but BIL is RIGHTFULLY fed up and done. All of us are questioning if we are even going to bother to go to camp at all this summer.

We don't expect anything out of them; if that is the retired life they want, that's fine! We are just tired of them acting like they are parents or grandparents of the year when really all they want is to seem like it without doing any of the work. At this point, I don't think we are overreacting for keeping our distance.

Edit: I forgot to mention! To this day, they will still bring up how M caused the house fire that destroyed their house over ten years ago. Because he had his truck plugged in. Sounds more like something wrong with the house's wiring, but she has brought it up numerous times over the years.",7,1740842022.0,inlaws,5,0.89,False

1j11luz,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1j11luz/homelessness_and_exhaustion/,Homelessness and Exhaustion,"Hey Homies,

I've had some really good news recently. I've been homeless this time around for 15 months. UK and in and out of London. 

I pick up a lot of good payed work in London. Also it's where I've spent 16 years of my life so I have connections and have one of the General Practitioners (Doctors) office listed as my address. It helps me get work having an address. When I get work I've been able to rent a cheap room and try to save. Work has been wildly inconsistent. 

In November I run out of money again. December was just so wet and January the weather wasn't bad here it just felt so grey and lasted so long. At the start of February they placed me in Emergency Accommodation. I had this refused twice due to shortages but they got me a room in a hostel. The hostel is pretty horrible but I follow the rules, stay away from people and mind my business. 

Last week I had some work come through. I set up a small office space so I have somewhere to go with the last of the money I had coined together. The good thing is the office space I rent from occasionally don't know my situation although I suspect they might. They know I always pay, and when I can't pay I let them know well ahead of time. 

I got a letter a couple of days ago that said my application for housing benefit had been approved. I was really alarmed. They didn't approve it when I had payslips and more information - I was expecting 4 weeks cover, to find work in those 4 weeks, sleep rough for 2 weeks and hopefully have some pay come in to get a room. 

I'm still getting work and working. I don't have to worry about moving. I can stay at the hostel which will help me get back on my feet easier. 

My issue is, exhaustion has really set in. 

Today I woke up from sleeping 16 hours. I do some stuff to keep me clean. There is an outdoor pool I go to early morning or late evening (when it opens 6.00am/9:00pm) it's my gym membership. It's a pool and has another gym with a punching bag. Thai Boxing and swimming is how I keep healthy but it's also my bathroom/shower. 

The hostel doesn't really have a bathroom/kind of kitchen. I usually avoid it due to some of the resident being bad or being heavily addicted. 

Normally I can recover by relaxing in the pool. 
Trying to get some sleep. 
Drinking IRN BRU and Coffee. 
IRN BRU is a Scottish soda. 
Eating an okay meal. 
Food wise I'm struggling. 
I go to a free breakfast if I go to the homeless centre but can't do that while I work next week. 

We do have a foodbank but the man that runs it has asked for me not to come back. He contacted my GP to see if I definitely need to go, my GP told me not to go back in case I get banned. 

How do you recover from exhaustion? 

One thing I will say. I am super proud of my body. Really proud of it. I am a male SA survivor from a prolonged period in my childhood. There have been times when my life where going well, I worked and I trained in Muay Thai at amautuer level. 

I've never been so proud of my body. It's survived group attacks. Predatory people. It's carried so much stuff. It's survived being outside for some weeks. I've never been so proud of my body. I've never felt this way about it. 

I know people will be having harder time. My heart goes out as I know homelessness is relentless. 

How do you recover from feeling exhausted?

The lid lights are on, and the steam button keeps blinking, supposedly indicating ""the water circuit is empty,"" according to the manual. But here's the thing: my water tank is full. I poked the spring-loaded outlet to confirm the water can flow, and it’s working fine. I also cleaned the infuser, and removed the steam tube, just in case there would be some blockage. Yet the error persists. The water coming out is warm (not hot, which I assume is normal at this stage), but that doesn't seem to clear the issue. Has anyone else run into this problem, or have any suggestions on what might be going wrong? Thanks a ton!

Zero dust, precisely cut, excellent fit that passes the pick-up test, and thick sturdy pieces that feel great in hand. The unique piece cut of the knobs/holes required just a glance to find a match, despite the relatively muted color palette. But what really clinched it for me was the image.

Here's the description from the back of the box:

*Kathryn Freeman applies her unique perspective to this iconic work of pointillism with a playful blending of modern and classic. Freeman credits Georges Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte as a major influence on her painting development, and it's an image she returns to repeatedly for inspiration. Elements of this much admired masterpiece seep into Freeman's modern living room filled with loyal dogs, coffee, and a long read of the weekly paper. Sunday, after all, is fun day.*

We go to the same school and met right before summer break. We ended up texting for three months because we weren’t on campus or anywhere near each other. When we got back we went on a coffee date. It was a little awkward but I had fun. After the date neither of us texted. I know this is hypocritical but I kind of expected him to text first so eventually after a few days I texted him to make sure that the silence was an indication that he didn’t like me (I swear I did it in a casual way). He told me that the silence wasn’t definitely bad and wasn’t sure if we were right for each other, but would be down to go on a second date. I kinda overreacted to that and ended things because I was worried that was just his way of letting me down easily. I ended up being hung up on him for months but tried to let it go. Eventually I started to become closer with this other guy 20M that I had met on instagram at about the same time. We had occasionally texted a few times a month but we didn’t actually meet in person until recently, but since meeting a few weeks ago we’ve hung out almost every day, getting coffee, watching movies, doing homework, and other things like that. It’s been entirely platonic but I can kind of feel the shift of it turning not platonic. I do think I kind of like him but I’m not entirely sure and feel like I’m running out of time to decide.

So here is the tricky part. I go to a large school but somehow the guy I met on hinge ended up being close friends with the guy I met on instagram. It’s at the point where we’ve hung out in the second guys apartment together multiple times. Honestly this didn’t bother me, we never really talked one on one and I was happy sticking around his friend. I thought that I was finally getting over him (before getting close with the second guy I had spent months agonizing to my friends and roommate over hinge guy, it got to the point where I had other guys on hinge trying to coach me on asking him out, it was bad). Then last night second guy had a party and said I could invite a friend to come with if I wanted, so I did. Towards the middle of the night she disappeared, she was pretty drunk at this point so I got really concerned and checked everywhere in the house but she was gone. Eventually this other guy at the party that I had met a few times saw me looking and came up to tell me he knew where she was. He said “sorry I should have told you sooner but she went with hinge guy to his apartment”. They lived near by and he had offered to show her his new cat. I felt so inexplicably sad. I hated that they were hitting it off. I felt awful and sad the rest of the night. I shouldn’t have felt this way. But I did. 

I recognize that I am slightly leading the second guy on and am worried about how to proceed. It’s not that I don’t like him, it’s just that I know it is not fair for me to pursue anything with him when I still have such glaring feelings for his friend. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve dug myself into a very deep hole. Do I stop being friends with all of them because their friendship is more important than me being there? Do I remain friends but make it clear to guy number two that I’m not interested (even though I’m not sure this is true)?Do I just chill out and go with flow? Do I date the second guy because maybe it’s not actually that serious? I just don’t know, what would you do???",1,1740841566.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

To je bilo tretjič, da sem šla v ta klub in vedno mi je ""Abby"" delala družbo. Kot prostitutka dobro vem, da imajo striptizete rade napitnine in sem ji zato takoj dala dvajsetaka v roko, ko sem jo prvič srečala. Ona je pa zgledala šokirana, mi dala denar nazaj in rekla, ""nooo, i no take money."" 
Vztrajala sem naj vzame ampak kar ni hotla.

Naslednjič, ko sem prišla v ta klub in so me spet prišle tri punce pozdravit sem prepoznala Abby in mi je spet ona delala družbo. Po treh jegrmajstrih in zavrnjenih napitninah sem jo vprašala zakaj noče vzet denarja in mi je rekla, ""it's no fair taking money from woman. I know you do this work too and i know how hard it is. I no take money from working woman."" 
Jaz, rahlo pijana, ji dam dvajsetaka za modrček in rečem, ""i touched your boobs, now you have to take my money"" in ona mi spet da nazaj.
Po še nekaj rundah pijače sem jo vprašala če bi sprejela napitnino v zameno za to da me malo pocarta in ona me pogleda z empatičnim pogledom in nežno reče, ""oh, you no need to pay for hugs"" in me začne nežno božat in stiskat kot, da sem ena ogromna mucka.

V četrtek, ko sem bila zadnjič tam sem gospoda natakarja takoj prosila če pošlje Abby do moje mize in ko je prisedla sem ji nasmejano rekla, ""good news. This time, i'm not giving you any money because i know you hate it when i do that"" in ona se je veselo nasmejala.

Po drugi rundi pijače je rekla, da gre samo na hitro do sosednje mize pogledat če lahko proda kak lapdance, da kaj zasluži. Pomahala sem ji z mojo denarnico in ona se je samo nasmehnila in šla do fantov, ki so rekli, da nimajo denarja. Prišla je nazaj, še malo sva spila, potem pa me naenkrat vpraša če ji dam moj instagram.
Jaz, pijana in šokirana rečem, ""whaa.. YOU want MY instagram? But why?""

-""i wanna go for coffee with you sometime""

Dam ji moj fon v roke in ona doda svoj profil. Nisem vedla kaj naj rečem, kaj naj naredim, ona je pa naslonila glavo na mojo ramo in me nežno stiskala za roko. 

Ko sem se naslednji dan zbudila in vprašala če sem vse samo sanjala sem pogledala fon in opazila, da je bilo vse res.

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Taming the Wild Beasts of the Design World,"# Freelance designer or studio owner, eh? Congrats! You're in a creative field, shaping the world one pixel at a time. But let's face it, not all clients are created equal. Have you ever felt like you're wrestling a grumpy badger instead of collaborating on a masterpiece? Then, you know what bad clients are about.

**Bad clients** can drain your energy faster than a broken coffee machine. They can make you question your life choices. They might make you yearn for a simpler existence, like maybe becoming a shepherd in the Swiss Alps. But don't pack your bags just yet!

This article is your survival kit for navigating the treacherous terrain of [difficult client relationships](https://weandthecolor.com/how-to-deal-with-bad-clients-as-a-creative-professional/197796). We'll explore the zoo of client personalities, equip you with practical strategies, and empower you to protect your sanity (and your profit margins). Ready to conquer the chaos? Let's roll!

# The Rogues' Gallery: What Makes a Client ""Bad""?

So, what exactly qualifies a client as ""bad""? It's not always intentional malice. Often, it’s a clash of expectations or a communication breakdown. Here's a lineup of common offenders:

* **The Houdini:** Vanishes for weeks, then reappears with urgent, last-minute requests.
* **The Detail Obsessive:** Critiques every millimeter and shade, driving you mad with revisions.
* **The Feature Fiend:** Keeps adding ""small"" requests that blow the budget and timeline.
* **The Discount Daredevil:** Tries to whittle your rates down to peanuts.
* **The Appreciative-ly Absent:** Takes your hard work for granted and gives the impression that everything is not worth the money.
* **The Payment Prowler:** Always has an excuse for delayed payments.
* **The Style Saboteur:** Insists on design choices that make you cringe.
* **The Demeaning Dragon:** Treats you disrespectfully and makes unreasonable demands.
* **The Foggy Communicator:** Gives unclear instructions.
* **The Reversible Client:** A **bad client** type who always changes his mind and requests endless revisions

Sound familiar? Let’s keep going.

# Why Me? Understanding the Magnetism of Bad Clients

So, you're attracting more than your fair share of challenging client experiences. Why? Let’s consider. Perhaps:

* **Murky Communication:** If you don't set clear expectations from the outset, chaos ensues.
* **Boundaries? What Boundaries?** Are you a ""yes"" person? Do you bend over backward to accommodate every whim? **Bad clients** will exploit that.
* **Selling Yourself Short:** Pricing too low attracts clients who prioritize cost over quality.
* **Aiming at Everyone:** Targeting too broad an audience attracts ill-fitting clients.
* **No Safety Net:** Operating without a solid contract is an invitation to disaster.

By identifying your shortcomings you can learn to attract better clients in the future.

# Shield Up: Preventing Bad Clients from the Start

The best defense against **bad clients** is a good offense. Consider these strategies:

* **Showcase Your Awesomeness:** A compelling portfolio attracts clients who value your style.
* **Craft a Digital HQ:** Your website should be easy to navigate, showcase your services, and highlight testimonials.
* **Price with Power:** Research industry standards and value your skills appropriately.
* **Qualify, Qualify, Qualify:** Ask potential clients about their goals, budget, and timeline.
* **Arm Yourself with a Contract:** A well-written contract is your best protection.
* **Listen to Your Spidey-Sense:** Trust your intuition; if something feels wrong, walk away.

# The Diplomat's Handbook: Communicating with Tricky Clients

Even with preventative measures, you'll still face challenging clients. Effective communication is crucial. Here's your guide:

* **Active Listening:** Understand the client's perspective before responding.
* **Stay Zen:** Maintain a calm, professional demeanor, even when provoked.
* **Set Boundaries:** Say ""no"" to unreasonable requests.
* **Document EVERYTHING:** Keep records of all communication.
* **Be Proactive:** Address potential problems before they escalate.
* **Overdeliver (Strategically):** Going the extra mile can build goodwill.
* **Offer Solutions, Not Just Problems:** Collaborate to find resolutions.

# Specific Bad Client Types: Tactics for Taming the Beast

Let's tackle those specific client types:

**The Micromanager:**

Reassure them that you value their input. Set clear expectations for the review process. Explain your design choices thoroughly.

**The Scope Creeper:**

Remind them of the original agreement. Explain that additional work requires additional compensation.

**The Late Payer:**

Review the contract. Send reminders, then follow up with a phone call. Consider legal action if necessary.

**The Unappreciative Client:**

Focus on your personal satisfaction of doing what you love. If nothing helps, consider terminating the project.

**The Rude Client:**

State that you do not tolerate disrespect. If it continues, leave.

# Pulling the Ripcord: Firing a Client (Professionally)

Sometimes, you need to cut ties. Here's how:

* **Consult the Contract:** Review the terms of termination.
* **Direct Communication:** Schedule a meeting or call.
* **Be Honest and Professional:** Explain that the project isn't a good fit.
* **Offer a Referral:** Recommend another designer if possible.
* **Close the Loop:** Finalize work and provide necessary files.
* **Move On:** Learn from the experience.

**Bad clients** don't have to derail your success. Set boundaries, communicate effectively, and know when to walk away. You deserve to work with clients who value your talents and treat you with respect. Now go forth and create awesome designs!

Figured I’d write about my first Briumvi infusion experience yesterday to help others who are just starting out. First symptoms appeared around Thanksgiving, MRI 12/19, more MRIs 1/7. Diagnosed 1/9. 

Arrival time: 7:55 am
After taking my vitals (temperature, oxygen, heart rate, blood pressure) and answering questions about recent illness, I took two Benadryl and two Tylenol. 
The nurse inserted the canule into my hand and pushed an IV steroid as well.
9:13 am: began the Briumvi
For the first hour, they checked my vitals every 15 minutes!
From 10:15 onward, they checked my vitals every 30 minutes. They began increasing the rate of the Briumvi around 11:30 or so. 
I got really hot and sweaty around noon, but had no other symptoms. They stopped the infusion for about 30 minutes, confirmed with my neuro, and then began it again. 
2:00 pm I finished the Briumvi, and they hooked up Saline. 
The nurse said saline was to help me rehydrate, push the Briumvi through my veins, and to give them an hour to monitor me. I left by 3:05. 

Yes, my first appt was 7 hours! A lot longer than I anticipated. My husband dropped me off and picked me up  

I brought: 
- a book
- my laptop and grading (I’m a teacher)
- noise canceling headphones
- water and a water mixed with Salud, and coffee
- lots of snacks - overnight oats, protein shake, almonds and craisins, yogurt smoothie, string cheese, carrots
- a blanket I never needed 
- chapstick

Symptoms after my infusion: I had a headache, but took Advil around 4:15 pm and it went away.

1j113qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/pressurewashing/comments/1j113qs/whats_the_lowest_temp_youre_willing_to_operate_at/,What’s the lowest temp you’re willing to operate at.,"Kitchen hood cleanings in particular for my side but how cold are you all willing to work in? Most of my cleanings happen at night when restaurant’s or whoever’s kitchen closes. We’ve been running into the issue of having to push alot of cleanings lately because of this off and on “polar vortex” cold snap crap the last month or two. My current set up is the washers in an enclosed trailer hauled by my pickup. 

Trailers only 5’x8’ and the design in cahoots with my trailer doesn’t really allow for it to chimney out a door so it gets unloaded and loaded each job etc. MITM’s recommendations is nothing below 40° to operate, we deff push that and will still clean closer to 32° but now we’re running down into the 20’s. In the low 30’s my guys still do everything the same tie off when climbing etc, but I make my washer wear yak traks to help some with his traction too. 

I would think that if I had a proper van set up where the washer stays in the back and chimneys out or what have you, that closed walled in space should help keep the washer warm enough you’d not be so concerned about risking cracking the pump or damaging the washer right? But problem is that doesn’t change the fact that everything my guy is gonna spray will freeze. Is pressure washing in general just truly a seasonal job? Or does anyone know a work around for this. My guys don’t mind cold they need and want money.

* [Ivy Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)#Fixes) \- Unspecified microcode fix released via Windows. Not sure if its included in manufacturer-provided BIOS updates. [And update possibly increase lag in some circumstances at least?](https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?t=12917)
* [Broadwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadwell_(microarchitecture)#Instruction_set_extensions) \- something about TSX?
* [Skylake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylake_(microarchitecture)#Known_issues) \-  something about Spectre and PAUSE latency - no mention of fix
* [Coffee Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Lake#9th_generation) \- something about Meltdown and L1 Terminal Fault

* [Raptor Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_Lake) \- overvolting issue fixed by microcode update?

In addition to wanting to find out more about these specific issues, I want to know:

* Is Wikipedia the best place to be reading about this? If not, where?

While I know what I would price my work at retail, what's my response when the owners say ""what are you looking to get?"" I assume they could price my boards at what I think they should sell for (let's assume that for now). Obviously, I don't know their overall business plan, but now the only thing I see is that I would have two prices, one if I place things there on consignment and another lower price if they buy from me up front.

1j10xbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ANRelationship/comments/1j10xbp/33_m4f_netherlands_nl_rotterdam_den_haag_the/,"33 [M4F] 🇳🇱 Netherlands (NL), Rotterdam / Den Haag (The Hague): seeking an intimate encounter, or something longer term 😊","**\*\* SCROLL DOWN FOR ENGLISH 🇬🇧 \*\***

🇳🇱 Misschien heb je pas net ontdekt dat het bestaat, of wist je al wat het is en was je er al naar op zoek: Adult Nursing Relationships (ANR) of Adult Breastfeeding (ABF), dus respectivelijk relaties of intieme ontmoetingen waarbij je borstvoeding geeft aan je partner.

Misschien klinkt het raar — aan een volwassen partner, echt?! — maar dat hoeft niet, vooral als jouw borsten belangrijk zijn voor jouw beleving van fysieke en emotionele intimiteit. Overigens is het niet strikt noodzakelijk dat je lacteert; het kan ook 'droog', de handeling is voor de rest uiteraard hetzelfde.

Ik weet al lang dat ANR/ABF iets is wat ik ik heel graag wil, ik wist al zelfs nog voordat ik wist dat het 'een ding' was. Alhoewel het voor mij natuurlijk een ware eer en voorrecht zou zijn om jouw moedermelk rechtstreeks van de bron te mogen proeven als je het voor me hebt — en ik ook wel bereid ben te helpen om het op te wekken als we daarvoor willen gaan — gaat het mij uiteindelijk niet per se om de melk zelf. Het gaat om de reis met jou; de intimiteit, binding, sensualiteit, rust en zaligheid die het geeft om op die manier met jou samen te zijn!

Dus, als jij een vrouw bent die ervan geniet als haar dames onverdeelde aandacht, liefde en verwennerij ontvangen, dan is dit misschien iets voor jou en wil ik het graag met je verkennen!🙂 Ik zelf voel me al vanaf vrijwel begin puberteit extreem aangetrokken tot borsten. Voor mij is weinig moment zo zalig als het moment dat ik de volheid en zachtheid van jouw borsten mag voelen in mijn handen, tegen mijn lijf, of in mijn mond ... masseren, kneden, zuigen, ik kan er letterlijk urenlang zonder onderbreking van genieten - jij hopelijk ook!

Voor de duidelijkheid, ik ben specifiek niet op zoek naar seks, en dus zie ik dit zeker ook zeker niet slechts als een soort achterdeur naar seks. Ik wil de fysieke intimiteit met jou écht verkennen via je borsten en ANR/ABF🤗

**Hoe ik het voor me zie:**

* Eerst chatten we een tijdje online, aanvankelijk hier in de reddit chat, maar daarna liefst overschakelen naar een ander platform zoals WhatsApp of Signal. Telegram is ook een optie als je je nummer nog niet wilt geven. Liever geen Skype; zoals laatst in het nieuws te lezen was, wordt Skype op 5 mei opgeheven.
* Daarna lijkt het me fijn om een keer een koffiedate te prikken of als je het leuk lijkt daarna een langere date. Als we een match zijn dan, dan kunnen we overgaan tot een reeks ontmoetingen, en als we echt een goede match zijn en er is een goede klik tussen ons buiten enkel het ANR/ABF-aspect, dan sta ik er zeker voor open om het verdere avontuur van dit leven met jou aan te gaan in een vaste relatie 🙂

**Over mij:**

* Leeftijd 33 jaar
* Lengte ong. 185 cm;
* Kort donkerblond haar;
* Rook niet;
* Geen vaste medicatie of medische aandoeningen;
* Mooie mannelijke, rustgevende, lage stem, hebben vrouwen mij wel eens verteld;
* MSc, fulltime baan als ingenieur in de elektrotechniek.
* Hobbies / interesses: wetenschap, (elektro)techniek, wiskunde, klussen, Inkscape, muziek (bespeel een aantal instrumenten), old school video spellen, fietsenmaken, hardlopen. Waarschijnlijk nog wel meer 😛
* Karakter: relaxed, nachtvlinder (van nature; voor mijn werk ben ik een vroege vogel geworden), droge humor, stabiel, introvert, nerderige type met een vleugje romantiek; wees niet verbaasd als ik de eerste keer bloemen voor je meeneem 💐🙂
* Ik woon zelfstandig. Mijn appartement is nog steeds vrij spartaans ingericht en niet alle kamers zijn gestoffeerd - er moet nog wel geklust worden - maar ik ben in staat jou hier te ontvangen!
* **Wat je van mij kunt verwachten:** ik communiceer pro-actief en neem initiatief. Ik reageer snel op berichten. Ik houd me aan afspraken en kom opdagen als we ergens afgesproken hebben. Ik respecteer alle grenzen die jij aangeeft; jouw 'nee' is voor mij ook NEE.

**Over jou:**

* Je geniet echt van fysieke intimiteit via je borsten;
* Waarover gesproken: het gaat mij niet om je cupmaat of welke vorm ze hebben. Het gaat er vooral om dat ze zin hebben om verwend te worden 😉
* Single of scheidende. Geen (stiekeme) affaires, geen drama, geen 'poly' constructies.
* Leeftijd: aller- alleruiterst 18-55 jaar. Kans op iets langdurigs is natuurlijk wel groter als je dichter in de buurt zijn van mijn leeftijd, zegge 26-35;
* Je bent een biologische vrouw, niet trans;
* Idealiter woon je in een plaats die in of vanuit de Randstad goed bereikbaar is met het OV (helaas geen auto). Antwerpen kan ook.
* **Wat ik van jou verwacht:** je reageert omdat je dit ook oprecht wilt proberen; je speelt geen spelletjes maar bent transparant over je intenties, je hebt geen andere agenda. Je ghost niet maar communiceert eerlijk als je twijfels hebt of het niet langer ziet zitten. Je komt met enige regelmaat online, of bent bereikbaar, en je reageert actief.

Als ik onaangekondigd 24 uur achter elkaar niets van jou verneem, of jij vertoont passief en ongeïnteresseerd gedrag, d.w.z. onredelijk trage of minimale reacties, dan beëindig ik ons contact ter bescherming van mijn eigen tijd.

 

🇬🇧 Perhaps you only just discovered that this is even a thing, or you already knew about it and have been seeking it for a while: Adult Nursing Relationships (ANR) or Adult Breastfeeding (ABF), i.e. respectively relationships or intimate encounters centered around breastfeeding your partner.

That might sound weird — breastfeeding an adult partner, really?! — but it really isn't, especially if your breasts are a powerful way for you to experience intimacy, emotional or physical. Also it is not required for you to be lactating, 'dry nursing' is also a perfectly valid way to go about ANR/ABF.

I have known for a very long time that ANR/ABF is something that I truly desire, even before I knew it was actually a 'thing'. Even though it would be an absolute pleasure and privilege to try your milk straight from the source if you are producing — and I would also absolutely be willing to help induce if that's where we take things — for me it is not about the milk. Rather, it's about our time and journey together; the intimacy, bonding, sensulaity, peace and bliss that being in the moment with a fine lady like yourself brings 😊

So, if you are a woman who enjoys her girls getting worshipped, spoiled and receiving my undivided attention, then this is something that I would love to explore with you!🙂 I have always felt a strong thing for women's breasts, ever since early puberty. For me there are few comparable moments that fill me with bliss and happiness as the moment I get to feel the fulness and softness of your bosoms in my hands, up against my body, or in my mouth ... massaging, kneading, suckling, ik can enjoy this for hours without break - and hopefully the same is true for you!

Just to be clear, **I am not looking for sex** and I am also definitely not one of those guys who sees this as a backdoor route to it. I want to explore the bliss and intimacy of ANR/ABF with you, focusing on your breasts, for its own sake 🤗

**How I envision this to go:**

* first we chat online for a while — initially here on Reddit in DMs, but preferably we switch to another platform such as WhatsApp or Signal. Telegram is also an option if you don't want to share your private phone number yet. Preferably no skype, as Microsoft have announced to discontinue Skype on May 5th.
* Then I would like to take you out on a coffee date or if you like a longer more elaborate date. If we are a match, then we can take this further into a more intimate setting, and if we are a really good match and there is good chemistry between thus beyond just the ABF aspect, then I am definitely willing to embark on a long term relationship with you and perhaps one day even tie the knot for good 🙂

**About me:**

* 33 years old
* Height: approximately 185 cm (approx. 6'1"" )
* Short, dark blond hair
* I do not smoke;
* No medical issues and take no regular drugs (DDF)
* Women have told me in the past I have a nice, soothing masculine voice;
* MSc degree, I work fulltime as an electrical engineer.
* Hobbies / interests: science, (electrical) engineering, maths, DIY'ing stuff, Inkscape, music (I play a few instruments), old school video games, fixing bikes, running/jogging. There's probably a few more I forgot to think of 😛
* Personality: laid back, night owl (by nature; for work I have had to become an early bird), dry humor, stable, introverted, loveable nerd with a romantic streak; do not be surprised if I bring you flowers the first time I see you 💐🙂
* I have my own place. My apartment is still fairly spartan as not all the rooms have gotten a floor yet - there is still some DIY'ing that needs to be done - but I am definitely able to host you here!
* **What you can expect from me:** I am a pro-active communicator and I take and show initiative. I respond to messages timely. I show up to dates and I keep promises. I respect any and every clearly communicated boundary you may have.

**About you:**

* You experience and enjoy physical and emotional intimacy through your breasts;
* Speaking of which: it is not important for me what size or shape they are, I do not obsess about your cup size. I care about them enjoying being worshipped and spoiled 😉
* You are actually single, or have already initiated divorce. No sneaky affairs, no drama, no 'poly' constructs. I am not out here looking to wreck homes or existing relationships.
* Age range: absolute limits are 18-55. Of course for something genuinely long term it would be better if you are close to me in age, say 26-35.
* You are a biological woman, i.e. not trans;
* Preferably you are located in a place that is easily reachable from the Randstad by public transport, or perhaps Antwerpen. Unfortunately I do not own a car;
* **What I expect from you:** be for real. If you reach out it's because you are actually interested in trying or doing this, you are not about playing games and having some hidden agenda, you are forthcoming about your intentions. You do not ghost but are honest about it if you are having second thoughts or have changed your mind. You are online and available to chat regularly, and you respond timely and consistently.

If you up and disappear unannounced in the middle of a back-and-forth conversation and you do not respond within 24 hours, then for the sake of protecting my own time I will assume you have ghosted me and I will move on. Likewise, if I sense low effort or a low interest attitude from you - minimal replies, passive reciprocation, unreasonably long response times - then I will also not hesitate to move on.",1,1740840114.0,ANRelationship,0,1.0,False

This dude is LEGIT. I’ve known him for about a year now and he knows the entire history of me and a specific person. This guy listened every time I reached to him. He had no problem telling me if something would work or not. He’s honest and will not waste his time if he feels it isn’t doable. 

Long story short, there was a woman I liked. We fell apart and then she got very bitter with me. We had not spoken for months. She moved on and I asked for his help. I wanted us to just be on good terms. No love, but at least be civil because I’d see her on a daily basis in a facility. Mike said this specific request would be a whole lot easier than requesting her to fall in love with me again. It’s gotta start from the bottom again and hopefully in time it’ll build to love, but the most important thing is being on good terms and on friendly terms again. He didn’t guarantee anything. In fact, he said there may be a 70% chance it will work. Fine. He’s honest and if it didn’t work, I knew it wasn’t his fault. 

No lie, in the time frame he assumed that it may work, it did!!! The woman and I are back being friendly again. I did ask him for advice on some stuff because I needed his opinion on whether my actions would harm the work he did or not. This specific action was friendly. It was more of a peace offering sort of, along with a letter I wrote just expressing my sadness that are not in contact and that I’d like if we could be friends even if that’s all it’ll be. Mike read the letter, told me how to edit it. And guess what? It worked! She read the letter, saw the little gift I got her from a very important trip I took and agreed to wanting to be friends. It was a huge success!!! 

Thankfully, Mike was awake the moment she texted me and giving me her reasons why we had a falling out. Once again, Mike gave me advice on what to say and when to say it. And again, this woman agreed with my request for having a friendship. It was a VERY VERY good start. Mike was being humble and saying he feels the work he casted wasn’t a victory but IT WAS!!! I went from Sept 19th to Feb 26th of no contact and having no hope of us ever talking again to being friendly and cordial and civil again. Mike may think it’s not a victory but to me it’s a huge victory. 

Next step is unknown but I’m gonna do exactly as he advised: baby steps! She won’t fall in love with me right away especially after this long of not speaking. Build the friendship again, earn her trust again, remind her she is a wonderful person and do small friendly things for her like buying her a coffee, etc. The little things that will remind her why she fell for me in the first place. 

Many may not trust a lot of spell casters, but Mike is not any spellcaster. He listens, he’s honest, he won’t scam you. He sends you proof every single time and sits down with Orobas and gets advice from him too. The biggest thing you must have is complete trust. If you trust Mike, then half the work is already done. The only 2 things he asks from you is trust and honesty. If you can do these then things will almost always work the way you want them. 

Mike, you have a client for life. I can’t thank you enough for everything. ",2,1740839782.0,TempleBackwardsTree,1,1.0,False

I used to believe I would be the one to solve this mystery. now I’m just trying to enjoy my days the best I can.

Patm is a strange thing. Is mysterious and it attacks you and others in different ways.  I’ve been witness to many. 

Most people have come to believe it is caused by something in the gut.  I personally believe mine went into my brain the day I caught it.  I felt it.  I was the sickest I’ve been in my life.  On Christmas Day from what felt like food poisoning to traveling up and through the blood brain barrier and giving me a 3 day migraine.  


Now on to the strange symptoms.  I overstand we all have different reactions and symptoms.  To the ones that don’t believe. I wish I didn’t either.  

Alcohol 
Coffee
Smoking 
Eating junk 

Lowers oxygen levels in the area
Causes confusion in others
It iterates any rash or  if bites
Transmit through telephone lines
Instantly travels 100s of yards 
Mine is by sight.  
(I can make people react on the freeway using only the rear view mirror)
Don’t catch cold or the flu 
One person has a problem with it making others scratch their balls 
When I had a pin worm infection it would make other peoples children scratch their ass and pick their nose. 
Makes others stomach rumble 


Some of this can be written off as being caused by yeast. Some by the new 5g soup we’re swimming in.  Possibly some dna changes. 


I’d advise everyone to look up the methylation process.  It has to do with the body’s detox.  
Too much folic acid.   Also leaky gut. And the inability to absorb nutrients properly.  

I did see a doctor in Las Vegas that was aware that some people were having yeast issues and making others itch around them.  When I asked “why” all he said was “we don’t know).

Maybe it’s just our natural aurora.  We are ment to be connected.  With my youngest 4, my wisdom teeth will pop out when they’re teething.  Same kind of connection. 

Feels like a useless post.

I guess If anything this is for the new patm peoples. The ones who need to know that they aren’t crazy even when the world tells them different.  

Also for the people who have been let down by this for profit medical system.

My dad raised me alone, he raped me for as long as i can remember, to the point i didn't even realise it wasn't normal before a lady in school taught us about SA. I spoke up when i was 13 and ended up in foster care, my father died to suicide shortly after and, basically, i've always been involved in hurtful activities since (drinking, drugs, hypersexuality, ect)

I'm just starting to get better, i'm now 22, i live abroad, i stopped drinking and i'm seeing a therapist.
 When i first moved out, i didn't know anyone and worked in a coffee shop, a customer came everyday, a woman, Mia* (36F) that was super sweet and we spoke a lot. After i stopped working at that coffee shop we became close friends.

Mia has been my best help for two years. A mother figure i never had, i told her everything, confessed every little details of my past i had not told anyone before, and she comforted me everytimes. She helped me to find friends, to find a job, and everytime i would call her for help she would run to come rescue me, no matter the situation or the hour of the day.

Mia is married to John* (40M), i don't know him a lot but we had conversations sometimes, and when she invited me to eat dinner with them we laughed together, he seemed like a pleasant guy, and Mia seemed to adore him everytime she spoke about him to me.

A friend of mine started working in the same business as John not so long ago, and she heard multiple rumors saying that John had been in prison before, and for a very serious reason, but she never really heard the reason. When she told me i didn't really care, it's none of my business and i know Mia did some drugs when younger so i thought it was substance related. But recently she told me that it's apparently an incest related case, a coworker told her that he SA's his ex spouse's child.

It's important to note that me and Mia absolutely do not have the same social circles, her friends are not my friends, and even tho she knows mines, she's not close with them and they don't know a lot about her and John. We also don't come from the same backgrounds at all, so i didn't have anything to verify those facts except Mia.

I asked Mia if it was true when we had a coffee together. She told me that she wouldn't lie and that it's true. She didn't minimize John's actions, said it was ""horrible"" and that no one should forgive him, i won't lie i was angry and started crying and she cried with me, and i just got up and left.

I don't know what to do, i never ever ever felt so betrayed in my entire life. I'm feeling so sick. The guy i joked withw the husband of the woman i confessed every single horrible detail of my father's abuse to, did the same fucking thing to a girl that was apparently less than 13. He did the same thing. And she forgave him. I can't srom thinking about what would have happened if she met my dad instead, she would forgive him too i guess? I can't even sleep anymore and it's been a week. 
I don't wanna speak to her again but i just need to let it all out somewhere, i've never been to vocal on my abuse to my other friends so it would be embarassing.",57,1740839671.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.98,False

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’ve had a stressful work week but have gone during other stressful times and my blood pressure was fine. 

Has anyone experienced this after taking birth control? I do feel like I may have a slight cold/allergies flaring up, but not sure if it was just a fluke or something to be concerned? I could be more active but my diet is fairly healthy. Or maybe my supplements interfering with the birth control? I have been drinking more coffee as well.. sorry just spitting out possibilities. 

I was told to go to urgent care if my eyesight begins to get blurry accompanied by a headache. I guess I should relax and just wait until my nurse calls and see what she advises.

On the bright side, the sonogram showed I had 20 follicles, which is amazing since I only have  my right ovary. Just hope my blood pressure doesn’t derail the outcome lol. ",1,1740838951.0,IVF,4,1.0,False

Also, when we learned the MFI would lead us to many many more rounds of IVF, high miscarriage rate and possibly no success, he was quick to accept the idea of a sperm donor bc he didn’t want me to suffer through endless retrievals and miscarriages.

It wasn't from his morning coffee, Bob had finally had the breakthrough idea that would change his career forever.

As Bob entered the office, he found his co-workers, Mark, Ed, and Dave getting settled in for another long week.

""Guys, I've done it,"" boasted Bob as he pulled out his office chair. ""I've come up with the perfect intersection.""

""Come on, Bob,"" said Dave, ""we've heard this one from you before.""

""Yes, but this one is IT! The wife and I were out on the weekend, and you know where Forest Hill connect with Waterloo? We've had so many issues with that spot, but I've had an idea that will revolutionize intersections forever!""

""Ok,"" said Ed, ""let's hear it then.""

""I was thinking I want to see more intersections where you have to crane your neck all the way back, almost like an owl!""

""Oh,"" said Dave, ""I'm liking it so far!""

""Yeah, like 3 of the intersections you almost wish you didn't have a passenger side head rest cause it'll be in the way. Make one of those at that turn where Waterloo & Lincoln Road connect both left and right, and you feel like you may end up smashing into another car! Then another where this arm of the intersection connects with Forest Hill."" Said Bob as he drew a small map for the guys to see.

""This is great!"" Said Mark, who was writing everything down with enthusiasm.

""Ok, then in the center, I want 2 stop signs. I kinda like the idea of people being confused as to who stops, so we'll make these two arms short so only 3 cars can fit between the stop signs connecting Waterloo and Forest Hill and drivers will have to leave a gap so those at the stop sign can pass, but dangerously as they can't fully see what's coming.""

""You know what I like about this Bob?"" asked Ed. ""I like how utterly confusing this is going to be. This is going to make newcomers to the city so perplexed! And those who live here will feel an equal sense of frustration and sympathy as they watch them try to navigate all this. It'll be like our own psychological experiment!""

""Well, Bob,"" said Mark, ""I think this'll make a name for you around here. And I propose that if anything crazy comes to this city, like those ridiculous traffic circles, we squash any plans to make this intersection part of those plans. This intersection will live through the ages! I think this deserves a pizza party lunch! Three cheers for Bob and his intersection!""

And that night, Bob went home and told his wife all about his plans and how he was finally being recognized in the office. And Bob's wife finally, after 8 long years, showed her husband the love and affection he'd been craving.
