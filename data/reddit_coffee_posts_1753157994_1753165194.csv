1m66iu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeensofKerala/comments/1m66iu1/i_found_out_my_wife_has_been_cheating_its_been_a/,"I found out my wife has been cheating, it's been a few months.","I had suspected something off about her for almost 5 years for now, I saw obvious signs and dismissed it. Until, I saw a sign really obvious, my wife came home at 2AM from a friend's ""Party"" drunk and her dress was worn from front to back. I had to investigate.

I have a friend group, just 4 of us, all of us went to the same High-School, college but went different career paths later. One of them is a Security Researcher at a big corporate firm(John), another one a PI(Sam) and the last one owns a tech startup with a decent value(George) at last, Me, I run a Real Estate business started by me and my dad.

So, since I had a friend who is a Private Investigator, I had him investigate my wife. He found her entering a house near the city multiple times a week, while I am in my office and my son's at school. He told me about it, and with the help of Sam, he instructed me to break her charging brick and replace it with the one he gave. I didn't know what it was but he got into her phone which I was skeptical of at first.

One night, last September, he called me at 10PM for an urgent visit to his house. John was there too, with a laptop on his coffee table. He handed me the beer and showed me the screenshots Sam got. Took me a while to process, but I found out all the suspicions were true. What saddened me the most was, it was George who she was cheating with. 3 of us decided to isolate him, but not to arise any suspicion we found it out.

I have a Real Estate company, and a lot of land here in Kochi, Kerala. They value a lot. I feared that all of these land would be lost as alimony since my wife doesn't have a job. So, I liquidated all my assets here and invested in shares of companies in Dubai. Now, my real estate company has assets worth only maximum 10k Dollars. Nothing more.

She still doesn't know I have found out about her bad side, but I am keeping quiet till I have moved everything I have into UAE. Next month is my flight to UAE when I'll relocate my company and assets to different places there. She doesn't know much of it but knows I am going for a ""Business Trip"" to Dubai unlike her ""Friend's Party"".

I just have my 2 friends with me, and my son who I might loose custody with. I haven't approached any lawyer, and my net worth in Kochi is just 60k Dollars along with my house there, which I am planning to giveaway to my brother who is going to get married.

At this point, she won't get much out of the alimony since she'll have get maximum 500 Dollars after I've relocated my assets, and I won't plan to confront until her parent's 50th wedding anniversary which is a grand event attended by 500+ people, which is after when I will have possibly moved everything I have so she won't get a dime.",1,1753164873.0,TeensofKerala,8,0.67,False

1m66fd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m66fd0/alcohol_spilled_on_my_classmates_laptop_and_she/,Alcohol spilled on my classmates laptop and she is blaming me and asking me to pay,"I (F27) am currently a student attending massage therapy school. 

Background; our tables that we use to work on are also massage tables since we also do alot of hands on work. These tables are wood and relatively sturdy and the tops are some kind of foam covered in a faux leather material. They also have a wooden shelf underneath at about shin/knee height that we can put our stuff on and many of us also use as a “foot rest” when sitting. 

Me and a few other classmates were studying after school in a classroom with massage tables desks and we all had our stuff/laptops open on the table. My classmate in question (F27) had a small paper cup (probably like 8oz size) on the table with around 2-3oz of liquor in it (yes she was drinking at school which I want to be very clear I do not think this is okay and DO NOT condone this behaviour but I didn’t really think anything of it at the time as I was not participating). I was sitting across from her leaned back in my chair with my feet on the wooden shelf underneath the table looking at my phone. She had the cup close to her side of the table beside her laptop. I was on my phone not really paying attention because I was tired from staying up late studying the night before, when I suddenly hear a spill. I look up and see her grabbing the cup and panicking because the alcohol had spilled on about 1/4 of the keyboard. I didn’t see what had happened but I just thought she had knocked it over. Another classmate went and grabbed some papertowel and we all started helping her mop up the spill. At this point she was freaking out and panicking about her macbook breaking and our classmate that was sitting beside her at the table was saying “oh it will be fine, it only spilled on the side not the whole thing,” and I was also trying to reassure her that it would most likely be okay (I have spilled a whole cup of coffee on my previous laptop and it was totally fine and it continued to work for years after). I was caught up with reassuring/helping her that I didn’t even think to ask what had happened to make the cup spill since I just assumed she had knocked it over. Eventually she decides she is probably gonna take the macbook to a repair shop to get it looked at but was still sitting at the table deciding what she was gonna do. I end up leaving probably like 15 mins after the spill since the situation seemed to be under control and I was beyond tired and wanted to go home to lay in bed before studying more. I have no idea if she continued drinking after I left or if anyone else did either. 

I am home for probably like an hour when I receive a text from her saying “Hey [my name], I ended waiting for hours at a laptop repair shop near the school to get a diagnosis for my MacBook. I was hoping there wouldn’t be any need for repairs, but this is what they came back with the repair cost and it’s $250. I’d really appreciate it if you could cover the cost for the repair. I attached the quote as well.” 

At this point I was really confused as she didn’t say anything about it being my fault when I was there and I just thought it was her that spilled it since I didn’t even see the cup spill. I replied with, “Wait, why would I have to cover the cost? I’m confused.” 

She responded with, “I get why you’re asking, and I know it was a mistake, but I know I didn’t spill it myself and the only other person there was [classmame sitting beside her] and he confirmed it was you that knocked the soju over.” 

I then reply with, “How would I have knocked it over though… I wasn’t even touching it. I’m sorry that your laptop got spilled on, but I honestly do not think that it was my fault. I was literally sitting there on my phone not moving and I hear a spill and looked up and saw the drink spilled. And even if I did bump the table or something (which I don’t even think happened) there’s no way that would be enough force to fully knock a cup over. If I knew in the moment that it was my fault I would have 100% offered to pay for the repair but I genuinely don’t think I did it. I don’t understand how [classmate sitting beside you] can confirm that it was 100% me?” 

She then goes on to say that the classmate sitting beside her told her that from what he “saw” my movement has tipped the cup over. And that she believes that that is what happened since the cup tipped over towards her, partially spilling on her laptop and onto the floor. But also keep in mind that these tables are not solid on the top, they are foam and if you lean on them it will “dent” or warp the surface. 

I genuinely do not think that the “movement” (I was sitting still on the chair) from me having my legs up on the table would be enough force to tip a cup over. She thinks that it is only fair that I pay for the repair since my “movement” caused the cup to tip and that the spill “happened from my side,” whatever that means. 

Normally if I damaged something accidentally I would always offer to pay but in this situation, I do not think that I am responsible for spilling the cup. I don’t understand why her and the other classmate didn’t say anything to me right after it happened, which also kind of makes me think that they are just blaming me since I left shortly after and wasn’t there to say anything. I also don’t know if she or the other classmate continued to drink after I left so I think that may also he a factor in why they are jumping to blame me. 

I don’t know that to do. Should I go in tomorrow and try to reenact what they are saying happened and see if the cup tips? Should I just pay? Should I pay for a portion or all? I’m very unsure of how to proceed as I don’t want to take responsibility for something that I don’t think I did. Please help!

1m66f5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisAintAdderall/comments/1m66f5p/i_fixed_the_elite_xr_sleeping_pills/,"I ""fixed"" the Elite XR sleeping pills","Elite XR is by far the worst generic I've ever tried for adderall but I accidentally stumbled on a fix for it   
(at least a fix for me, ofc there are no guarantees it'll work the same for everyone else who has had issues with this generic)

A little backstory: I'm switching over to zenzedi and my pharmacy took much longer than expected to order and fill it so I was going through extended adderall withdrawals while I waited. I saw a few other users recommend ephedrine i.e. bronkaid tablets to make withdrawals more tolerable and I had a lot of success with it. Made the withdrawal experience at least 60-70% more manageable and if you ever end up going through withdrawals yourself it's a big recommend from me. Now, while it does help a lot, the withdrawals are still godawful. You'll have more energy on ephedrine, sure, but you will still feel like there's something missing, and it's like your brain is running at 0.75 playback speed 24/7

One day I realized I still have a ton of elite XRs since I didn't bother taking them most days because of how useless they were at actually treating my ADHD. Specifically what it does for me is it makes me REALLY sleepy and gives me pretty bad brain fog, so if that's similar to your experience with that brand maybe this might help. My logic was maybe the ephedrine would counteract the sleepy effect I get from elites and I might see some additional relief from withdrawals since they *should* have some amphetamine in them. What I wasn't expecting was it turning the elites into actual, decent adderall. The brain fog side effect was gone, I no longer felt sleepy (I did feel mellow, but in a good calming way) I was motivated, focus and attention span improved, my mind just generally felt clearer. It felt remarkably similar to how my preferred generic brand feels like, somehow. I've drank coffee with the elite XRs before and that didn't help, but for whatever reason this specific stimulant turns it into a completely different drug. I've done this 5 days in a row now and it has consistently worked for me.

Now I'm not saying mixing ephedrine with your adderall will always make it better, it likely won't. I could imagine getting pretty bad anxiety and jitters under most circumstances, but elite pharmaceuticals somehow discovered a way to make stimulants put you to sleep, so in this particular case it definitely helps and it has helped a lot more than I expected. Best part about all of this? Ephedrine is OTC and very cheap. I got 60 pills for only 14 dollars and I only take half a pill every 3 hours or so until the elites wear off (so like a pill and a half total for the duration of one adderall XR)

I've tried everything under the sun to make my elites work and nothing ever came even remotely close to just mixing it with ephedrine. I tried  
\* Crushing up the XR beads into a fine powder, then splitting the powder into two doses since my theory was maybe the fillers were causing it to release irregularly thus causing that weird side effect. That only ended up making me even sleepier.   
\* Boiling it in water for a while until the beads outer shells dissolved, then drinking the water. It felt like I didn't even take anything at all.   
\* Taking it at different times on my cycle with ample time not taking it in between. No change.   
\* Mixing some of the bead powder with my IR. That just made my IR less effective.   
\* Taking antihistamines and even steroid pills in case the side effects were caused by allergies. No change.   
  
I was genuinely starting to think it wasn't even amphetamines, but no, mixed with ephedrine it's just classic adderall with all of its constant mouth dryness, insomnia, hot flashes, and all (I experienced none of these common adderall side effects on elite XR alone, mind you).

**TLDR:** If your elite XRs make you sleepy then mix them with bronkaid and it turns into very decent adderall. Modern day alchemy type shi",1,1753164490.0,ThisAintAdderall,0,1.0,False

They can walk out of our lives without warning. They can drift apart slowly. They can grow into someone we don’t recognize anymore. They can choose someone else. They can outgrow you without saying a word. They can leave you while being in the same city, same room, same world. And I think, death is the kindest when it comes, ways to lose a person. Because despite it’s finality, death is honest. It doesn’t leave room for second guesses, for endless replays of where it went wrong. Death doesn’t reduce you to someone they used to know. If they are still alive, if they are still breathing, still choosing other lives and other people and other future’s, that is the cruelest form of loss.It is the grief that breathes. It is the ache that doesn’t end. Because somewhere out there the person whom you called home is building a new home, brick by brick, with someone else.And you are left blueprints of a house that was never built. No matter who you are, whether you are nineteen or ninety, whether you have loved once or many times, the grief visits everyone. The grief of being forgotten, of being replaced, of no longer fitting into the life you once imagined together. The grief of being replaced, of being left behind. The grief of knowing someone so well, only to watch them becoming a stranger with your stories still lodged inside them. They become strangers with familiar faces. You remember their smile, their voice, the way their faces lit when they used to joke. You know their favourite way to fall asleep and the smell of their shampoo. But now they are someone else, and you’re no longer a part of their day, their plans, their anything. It feels like watching a movie where you were once the lead, and now you are not even in the credits. It is just strange how people can go from strangers to lovers and somehow, back to strangers again. But now you are a stranger who know I take my coffee. A stranger who used to be your safe place. A stranger who knows your childhood fears, your inside jokes and yet walks past like you are invisible. At least with death, the pain has shape. Society makes room for mourning the death. We wear black. We send condolences. We light candles and cry without shame.

1m669eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1m669eu/supplements_you_need_and_dont/,Supplements you NEED and DON’T,"Hey guys, 

The supplement industry aka Nutraceutical Industry has grown 4 times since 2020. Since we’ve tried to take care of our health, fearmongering has reached its peak. It is estimated to be USD 8-10 Billion by the end of 2025.

Fearmongering aka hitting your insecurity is the best way for any brand to sell you something you don’t really need. 



So let me help you breakdown the supplements you might need and the ones you DON’T. 



What do you need? 

* If you find it hard to complete your protein requirement, you can consider protein supplements. BUT WHICH ONE? 

Whey protein has a very good absorption rate when compared to plant protein. 

**6/10 people want to shift to plant protein due to digestive issues**. Before you shift to plant protein, give this a shot. **Try unflavoured protein** if you can handle lactose. WHY?

Brands use acids to mimic the taste of chocolate, mango, or whatever. When these acids are cheap and low grade, they tend to disrupt gut microbiome. 



* Creatine is undoubtedly the most researched supplement. Creatine enters our muscles and is stored as phosphocreatine, when ATP(Adenosine triphosphate) aka energy is used it becomes ADP(Adenosine diphosphate). Phosphocreatine donates its phosphate to ADP making it ATP aka more energy packets. 

Well there are people suggesting the advantages of creatine on cognitive function like Huberman Uncle, I personally haven’t noticed any cognitive benefits from creatine. But, helps me get jacked in the gym :)

If you have a history of kidney or liver issues, I would suggest you consult your doctor before you consume creatine. 



* Caffeine/ Pre-Workouts: Caffeine has enough RTI’s and meta analysis to back its efficiency. Consuming caffeine blocks your adenosine receptors, making you feel “not drowsy”, it also releases stimulatory neurotransmitters like dopamine making you feel energetic. You can consume a good pre workout. **BUT, I wouldn't suggest caffeine or pre workouts to beginners.** First **fall in love with the process**, consider supplements later.



What you don’t need? 

* Fruits are packed with vitamins and so is your diet, if you’re having a balanced diet. Supplementing with MULTIVITAMIN when you don’t know what you’re deficient in isn't a wise thing to do. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE BODY IS DEFICIENT IN, why supplement random things? Get your bloodwork and supplement what you're deficient in!

  


* Fat burners: If your fat burner is caffeine based, you’re better off drinking coffee. But what it does is high doses of caffeine increases your heart rate which in return burns more calories. If this sounds like a good idea to you, you’re wrong, DON’T.

L-Carnitine is a supplement promoted for fatloss. Studies show that only 5-10% of it gets absorbed into the blood. BUT, there still isn’t any study which suggests that L-Carnitine gets into your mitochondria. THUS, not enough evidence. DON’T. 



* BCAA: They contain amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine. You can attain all of these amino acids when you have a balanced meal. From meat, dairy and lentil products. 

Until you’re an extremely strict VEGAN, BCAA would do nothing to you. 



Comment what supplements you have questions with, I’d love to help you out. 



Hope this helps :)

1m66990,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m66990/a_letter_to_my_ex/,A Letter to My Ex,"I posted a rant the other day about how my ex hurt me. What she did wrong. Although the breakup was primarily her fault and her just not being ready for a relationship, I still love her so much and I don’t have any negative feelings for her. I’m still processing and navigating my emotions 4 months later. I did make mistakes too. This is the apology I’d like to give her. 

E,

Please do read this and only if you are up to it, let me know that you read it. I know that you are sick of me communicating myself to you and I know that you are frustrated because you have asked me to stop and I haven’t listened.  There is no excuse that I can make for myself, but know that I am listening and I am trying. I try so hard every single day and every single hour. You know how much I love you and how much I care about you and I know that every single time I reach out to you I push you further away.  I know that each time it jeopardizes any possibility of a future that you and I may have, whatever that could be. And so more than anything else I want to apologize to you.

I know how badly you were hurt in this relationship. I know that I/it made you feel sick and I am sorry E.  I’m sorry for pulling you back into it so hard every time you tried to leave, even when you were already so hurt. You were gasping for air, but I kept forcing you back underwater.  I hurt you to the point that you couldn’t do it anymore. You kept trying too because you were brave and because I know that you felt the connection too. But it wasn’t sustainable and it hurt you and I am so sorry E. I told myself that I was the one making all of the sacrifice and that I was doing everything for you and for us, but in reality it was selfish of me and I was doing it because I was afraid of losing you. I have never felt the connection I did with you ever before in my life. I have never loved every single part of a person like I did with you. I do not believe that you can feel love like that when it is one sided. I believe that you loved me more than you have ever loved anyone. I know that we still do love each other. I was just so intent on making things work that I tried to force it.  I keep saying that this breakup hurts so badly because whenever I would pull you back, I’d give up a part of myself and that I did that until the end when I had nothing left. That might be true, but I didn’t realize that you were going through the same thing. Every fight hurt you more and more and all of the anxiety built and built until you literally felt like you were being crushed. It was selfish of me to think and to pretend that I was the only one giving something up.

The reality is that neither of us were perfect. You were not ready and you told me so in the beginning of our relationship. I think that it would have been okay if I could have been patient and done things differently to heal you - instead my actions made your anxiety worse.  I think that it would have been okay if you had gone to therapy in the beginning and would have been open to me. If either one of those things were true, I think that we could have healed each other and grown together into something truly special. But neither of those things happened and instead we entered into this cycle where we brought out the worst part of each other. You don’t have to believe me and honestly I wouldn't expect you to believe me since I keep reaching out like this. But I have changed and if we were to see each other again I would go to therapy for myself and I would do everything in my power to help us grow. You said that you were not ready for a relationship of this seriousness because of your trauma.  If I was going to keep pulling you back into this relationship it was my job to lead by example and show you what love can be, what it means to be open to someone, and what it means to trust someone. One chance and I would show you E.

My words are only words though and I wish so badly that I could show you. I know how badly this relationship hurt and I understand why you would be afraid to ever try again with me. I know that my actions in the breakup continue to echo my actions in the relationship (the ones that made you sick in the first place). But I have changed and things would be different… it is just hard for me when I can’t communicate with you or even apologize. The situation we are in now is not indicative of how things would be or how I would be if we were to ever try again. So I hope that you can understand that. That doesn’t mean that I am not trying, because I am. I am seeing a new therapist and I am taking proactive steps to be better.  I was hoping that I could show you that if we could just grab coffee or boba or ice cream. We could sit and you could lead the entire conversation and we wouldn’t talk about anything that you didn't want to. Or we could go on a walk and not say anything at all. Or we could go to Karaoke and you could make fun of my singing… and then you would sing and I would sit and listen and watch and fall in love all over again. 

Or we could say fuck it and we could go anywhere in the world tomorrow. We could go ski in Chile and you could practice your Spanish. We could go scuba diving in Thailand and lay on the beach. We could go skydiving in Australia and try not to die. We could relax in Europe and try new restaurants. We could go to Korea and I could understand another part of you and I am sure that I would fall that much more in love. I will take you tomorrow and we don’t need to talk about the past. The only thing for you to think about would be what adventure we’re going on the next day. I don’t say all of this to lovebomb you or to overwhelm you. I just want to start over. I want to give you everything that I didn’t give you before, because you deserve everything. You are the most special person I have ever met.

You are my person and there doesn’t need to be pressure for us to work. And so I am okay with coffee. Or meeting at the airport. Or you can text me and tell me you hate me. It doesn’t matter. But I will always love you and that will never change. I want to know how Pomi is. I want to know how your grandmother is. I want to know if you are getting to volunteer at the shelter. I want to know if you have been learning Spanish (I have been learning Korean). I love every single thing about you E. The most important moments of my life are with you. The moments that you were the most vulnerable are the same moments that made me fall in love with you in ways that I never thought I could with someone. When you had your hot-tub rash, when you had to have your implant replaced, you going from so nervous to so comfortable in Maryland… you were just so amazing and you were so strong. I want that time in Maryland again every single year for the rest of my life. I want to watch you open gifts under the tree. I want to cook you new things. I want to take you to new places. I want to buy you the most absurd engagement ring in the world so that everyone knows that you’re mine. I want to have our own cats and dogs. I am not sick and I am not sorry about how I feel. I love you unconditionally. I tried to watch past lives again the other day and it wrecked me. All I can think about when I watch a romantic movie or hear a romantic story is how I love you in the same way and how nothing that has happened isn’t something that we can get over. I just watch to start over, a first date, no pressure. Or for you to tell me you hate me. I don’t have an ounce of any emotion for you other than complete and total love and admiration. Most people will never love someone the way we loved each other. The way that I know we still do. You are the most beautiful girl in the world. You are the love of my life.

This week, we’re celebrating Otto’s birthday with lake swims and Swedish fika! Armed with power tools, we begin tearing down the bathroom wall to extend the space & make room for roof fixing to begin next month. There’s a new (second!) wood stove for the garden, a trip to a charming local antiques market, and some unexpected chaos with a punctured tyre.  
  
Back home, we tidy up the woodpile, build a cozy new fire pit seating area, and forage red currants and raspberries from our  garden. Slow living, Swedish summer, and a bit of hands-on action for balance.

1m667v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rouvy/comments/1m667v0/rouvy_events/,Rouvy events,"I'm reasonably new to the Rouvy (level 31) and have a question for the more seasoned riders on this forum regarding events, particularly when comparing to other platforms like Zwift.

I've noticed that regardless of the event (Race or Group Ride), it ultimately always turns out to be Race. This is also evidenced in the more popular rides with higher rider numbers. Is this normal for the Rouvy community? There's hardly any Group Ride that ends in a compact group at a balanced pace, and even the Leader is drawn to racing. These events are great but my understanding of a group ride is that everyone rides in a compact bunch. Would introducing categories and features similar to Beacons/Sweepers/Fences help with this?

I've also noticed the following nuances: 

 - there are fewer choices of Group Rides 
 - most rides are less than 60 minutes 
 - a lack of tempo/Zone 2&3 rides 
 - similarly a lack of longer rides (which reminds me - Rouvy desperately needs a coffee break feature similar to Zwift to top up hydration or for nature breaks for longer rides)
 - a lack of categorised rides based on FTP, w/kg, average speed, or similar criteria

I'd argue that there is room for the creation of more alternative ride choices to accommodate the requirements of more diverse user types.

Anyone agree that these features would help grow the community and make Rouvy a more attractive platform for a broader population?",2,1753163744.0,Rouvy,4,1.0,False

The airport lounge.

Eloise Claire scrolled through her phone out of boredom. Suddenly, a video title caught her eye. ""What's the Most Willingly You've Ever Done for an Ex You Couldn't Forget?""

Curious, she tapped it open. The screen was pitch black, but as soon as a familiar voice came through, she froze.

""My ex was into beauty. She wanted a nose job,"" the man said with a light chuckle, like he was remembering something sweet. ""But she was scared of the pain, so she ended up using my rib.""

Someone in the video whistled. ""What's that saying again? A woman is made from a man's rib, right? Damn, Leon, that's real love right there!""

The man just laughed and didn't deny it.

The moment she heard the name Leon, her pupils contracted slightly. She was almost certain that it was Leon Brunner—her fiancé.

His voice continued, and she unconsciously held her breath.

""She was delicate and wouldn't do a thing herself. I even put on her socks for her.

""Oh—and when we broke up, she swore she'd kill herself if I ever moved on. Said she'd wait for me the rest of her life.""

The guys laughed louder, teasing him. ""Come on, you're saying you never had any feelings for Eloise?""

The second her name came up, her hands clenched. Sweat gathered in her palms.

""Just a thing,"" Leon said, his voice low, almost careless. ""Nothing worth taking seriously.""

The words landed like ice water. Every illusion shattered. A numb chill spread up her spine, and her mind went blank.

""Leon, I'm posting this,"" someone joked.

""Go ahead,"" he said coldly.

""You're not scared your fiancée will see it and flip?""

""She's just a toy. I've played long enough. Now that my girl's back, I won't let her get hurt again.""

Three years. And she was just a toy to him!

A sharp pain stabbed through her chest. She couldn't breathe.

She sat down, hugging herself tight, as if that could hold her together. The departure lounge buzzed with people, yet no one seemed to notice the girl on the floor—someone clearly out of place.

Until a young woman finally spotted her. She rushed over and said worriedly, ""Are you okay? Low blood sugar? I've got candy.""

But when Eloise looked up, her pretty face was soaked with tears. A complete wreck.

The sweet-faced young woman froze, a little startled. ""Why are you crying?"" she asked softly.

Eloise shook her head. She didn't have the strength to answer. The young woman hesitated, then gently pried open Eloise's palm and placed a piece of candy in it.

""Sugar helps with the mood,"" she said, then walked away.

Eloise popped the candy into her mouth with trembling fingers. No sweetness. Only bitterness, spreading across her tongue.

The boarding call echoed overhead. She stood and walked toward the gate, step by step. Even after settling into her seat, the tears wouldn't stop. Her vision stayed fogged, her eyes burning.

Somewhere in that blur, she saw him again. The first time she met Leon.

Back then, her family life was a wreck. She'd spiraled into depression, deep and consuming. Self-destructive thoughts came often. Too often.

She'd gone up to rooftops more than once. The last time, she stood at the edge, and a man appeared out of nowhere, tall and shadowed, his face obscured in the dark. He looked at her foot hovering on the ledge and swore under his breath. ""Fuck!""

Just as she closed her eyes and leaned forward, arms numb, he grabbed her from behind and yanked her back. That time, she saw his face clearly.

Sharp jawline and charming eyes. Lips pressed into a thin, unhappy line. He smelled faintly of alcohol.

""Trying to die?"" he snapped, voice sharp, eyes cold—like he was looking at a lunatic.

But Eloise only smiled—a sudden, bright, unruly smile. For the first time in a long while, something rippled in her still, dead heart.

She didn't want to die anymore.

Looking up at the tall, handsome stranger, she held out her hand. ""I'm Eloise. Wanna date?""

The man looked at her with interest, his eyes almost like he was seeing someone else through her. ""Sure.""

Just like that, two strangers became lovers.

Leon took her to one therapist after another. He handled her emotions like glass—carefully, patiently. She changed. She laughed again.

When she mumbled about craving pulled pork at midnight, he'd drive across half the city to get it; When she cried from anxiety in the middle of the night, he held her tight, staying awake until morning just to keep her steady.

She'd once believed he loved her—the way she loved him. But now, everything told her otherwise.

It had all been a dream. A dream so fragile and broken, no piece could fit back together.

She wiped her tears and took out her phone. The plane hadn't taken off yet. She dialed the number.

""I'll go through with the engagement,"" she said.

**Chapter 2**

Eloise was the illegitimate daughter of the Claire family in California. Her mother had once been the patriarch's first love. But under family pressure, he'd married a more ""suitable"" woman, even though her mother was already pregnant at the time.

Before she died, Eloise's mother made him promise to take care of her. Eloise still remembered how stunned and small she felt the first time she saw Claire's manor.

It looked like a palace. A place that had trapped her mother—and now, trapped her too.

No one in the Claire family liked her. Even the maids called her a bastard. Yvonne Claire, the daughter of the official wife, had bullied her since childhood.

Later, Eloise's father forced her into an arranged marriage with the son of the Bronner family—a man rumored to be hideously ugly—just to keep Yvonne from being married off instead.

She stared at the WhatsApp contact her father sent her, fingers trembling slightly. Then she steeled herself and tapped ""Add to contact.""

Leon was possessive and controlling. Even if he didn't love her, he wouldn't let her go. The only way out was to marry someone else.

She typed, ""Hi, I'm Eloise.""

No reply. She blinked, confused, then felt a light tap on her shoulder.

""Hey!""

She turned. It was the same sweet-faced young woman from the airport. Pale, too pale—like illness clung to her skin.

""I'm Aurelie. What's your name?""

""Eloise.""

""Don't be sad, okay? Everything passes eventually. I've been through a lot too, and I got through it.""

Eloise's anxious heart settled a little. She stared out the window, dazed, watching the clouds drift by. Today was Leon's birthday. She'd traveled back overnight from another state just to celebrate with him. She hadn't slept at all.

But earlier, he'd told her he didn't have time to pick her up. Her thumb rubbed absently along the edge of her phone as she followed the crowd off the plane.

Then—a voice. It sounded too familiar.

""Ellie.""

Eloise's head snapped up. Not far ahead, Leon stood in a black suit, waving at Aurelie Berna. His face was soft, and his gaze was warm, resembling still water in the sun.

Eloise's heart dropped. Her hand clenched tightly around the hem of her dress. ""Didn't he say he didn't have time?"" she thought.

As Eloise stood frozen, Leon—like he sensed something—suddenly looked in her direction. The moment he saw her, his brows drew together in a faint frown.

""Come here, Eloise."" His tone left no room for argument, and she forced herself forward.

The moment Aurelie saw her, she blinked in surprise, then broke into a big, bright smile. ""Oh, it's you! You must be Leon's girlfriend, right?""

Eloise stared at her for a second. ""And you're...""

Before Leon could answer, Aurelie jumped in. ""I'm his cousin.""

Leon frowned but didn't say anything.

When they got to the car, Aurelie offered to take the back seat. Eloise nodded and was just about to climb into the passenger seat when Leon stopped her.

""Sit in the back. Ellie's not feeling well. It's uncomfortable back there.""

He looked serious and calm, like it was nothing. Eloise hesitated, then slowly stepped back and didn't say a word. But the bitter taste in her mouth wouldn't fade.

She got carsick easily, and Leon knew that. In their three years together, she had never once sat in the back seat.

The tension thickened. Aurelie quickly tried to ease it, chirping about games they could play at the birthday dinner later.

Eloise just sat there, silent.

Leon frowned again, glancing over at her. ""What's with you today? Why are you being so off?""

A sharp pain stabbed through her chest, like someone had rammed a knife right in. He knew she didn't like crowds. He'd always known...

Outside the window, rain started to fall. Typical southern weather—changing in a blink.

Then her phone rang. It was her father. ""Elle, clear out your things from the room. The new maid needs a place to stay.""

The Claire's manor had more rooms than anyone could count. And they couldn't spare even one?

Silence filled the car. Stifling. Eloise felt heat rising in her cheeks, like someone had slapped her hard.

She closed her eyes. Exhausted.

""I want to get out.""

**Chapter 3**

Leon didn't stop. ""No time to take you back. The party's starting. Ellie's been abroad for years—everyone's excited to see her.""

Eloise's nails dug into her palms. Her eyes burned. The tears almost fell, but she tilted her head back and swallowed them down.

Her mother's keepsakes were still at Claire's manor. If she didn't get them soon, they'd probably toss them out.

""No need to take me. Stop the car.""

Leon kept driving. Aurelie frowned and lightly tapped his arm, her voice sweet as syrup. ""Stop the car. She looks like she's in a rush. Must be important. Aren't you her boyfriend? Try acting like it.""

The air went still, and the car pulled over immediately.

Eloise gave Leon a long look, then turned to Aurelie and said softly, ""Thanks.""

Aurelie smiled, sugar-sweet. ""Don't mention it. There should be an umbrella in the trunk.""

Eloise blinked, then shook her head. She opened the door with a pale, graceful hand.

The moment she stepped out, the car sped off like it was fleeing a curse.

She let out a bitter laugh. Three years of dating, and she never even knew he kept an umbrella in the car.

The rain hit hard, cold, and cutting. She kicked off her heels and walked barefoot all the way back to Claire's manor.

Lights blazed inside the house. Glass shattered somewhere. She rushed in too fast. A sharp, stinging shot through her foot—glass had sliced it open. She flinched.

The maids stood stiffly in the yard, eyes cold and judgmental. She ignored them until she saw what was on the floor. Her eyes snapped wide.

A photo frame that was cracked beyond saving. Inside the frame was a picture of a beautiful woman holding a girl's hand, which was now soaked and smeared with water.

Her chest ached. Her heels slipped from her hand, landing with a dull thud. She knelt and picked up the frame, her fingers trembling over the ruined photo.

""Mom..."" Her whisper broke the silence.

""Well, isn't this Eloise, the first daughter of the Claire family? What happened to you? I thought you landed the Brunner family heir. Why do you still look like a wreck?""

A sharp, arrogant voice rang out. Eloise looked up and locked eyes with the woman descending the stairs. Hatred flared in her gaze.

Her face was pale. She spoke through clenched teeth, ""Yvonne, whatever you've got to say, say it to me. This was the last thing my mom left me.""

Yvonne let out a mocking laugh like she'd just heard the world's best joke.

""And? That doesn't make it special. She's not my mom."" She examined her freshly manicured nails, her voice full of scorn.

""Your precious Leon just proposed to his ex at the birthday party. And you're here crying over your mommy?""

Then Yvonne tossed her phone toward Eloise, the screen already lit up with a paused video. The man in the video was Leon. And the woman standing across from him... was Aurelie.

Eloise's pupils shrank. Her ankle throbbed, the pain flaring up. Her eyes turned red, and the tears were close.

Seeing her go pale, Yvonne smiled with satisfaction. She took her phone from Eloise's hand and put it away. ""Heard you finally agreed to that arranged marriage with Dad, huh? Should've done it earlier. Sure, Mr. Bronner is ugly, but he's loaded. Just like your gold-digging mom—both of you love money.""

Yvonne lounged on the couch like a queen tossing scraps. ""Dad says the wedding's in 20 days.""

Eloise's fingers curled into fists. She was about to snap—when Yvonne suddenly added with a grin, ""Oh, and by the way—Leon's ex said no.""

**Chapter 4**

Eloise didn't even know how she made it back to the apartment. One hand clutched her heels, and the other held the photo tight to her chest. Still, it got soaked. The woman's beautiful face blurred even more.

She collapsed to the cold floor and broke down. Cried hard. She wiped the photo again and again, but her tears kept falling, smudging everything. Her sobs turned ragged. She lay there, gasping.

Then, a knock at the door. The next second, a pair of black leather shoes stepped into view.

Leon stood there, staring at her curled up on the floor. His brow twitched. He picked her up and set her on the couch, his face full of frustrated pity.

""I just didn't take you to Claire's manor. Was that really such a big deal?""

Was it?

Right then, Eloise saw it clearly. The man she loved wasn't the same anymore and hadn't been for a long time.

Before she left Claire's manor, she heard the whole story. Leon and Aurelie were a perfect match. Talented guy—beautiful girl. Everyone used to envy them. No one knew why they broke up.

Back then, they were California's golden couple. Aurelie would mention some tiny little thing, and Leon would remember it like scripture.

She looked at the man in front of her and gave a bitter smile. So this is what it feels like—when someone doesn't love you. It's painfully obvious.

Even if he'd treated her well these past three years, she could still tell—he was looking through her, missing someone else.

She pulled away from his arms, her voice calm, distant. ""It's a big deal.""

Leon yanked at his tie, annoyed and drained.

""It's just something small."" Then he got up and left. The door slammed behind him. Loud. Final.

Eloise flinched. A second later, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Yvonne. A photo. Her tears slipped out again and hit the screen. Leon was standing outside Aurelie's place. Arms full of roses. But Aurelie never came down.

That night, Eloise barely slept a wink.

This apartment had been a gift from Leon. He said it was meant to be her safety net. But Eloise didn't want it anymore. She took the deed to the property office and had the name changed back to Leon's.

""I'll return everything you gave me,"" she thought.

Staring out at the green trees beyond the window, she felt herself drift. It had been a long time since she'd really looked at the world outside.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed—a message from Aurelie. After a long pause, Eloise replied to it.

Aurelie asked to meet at a café. When Eloise arrived, Aurelie was already seated, smiling brightly the moment she walked in. ""Hey, Elle! Want something to drink?""

Eloise froze for half a second, then walked over slowly and pulled out the chair. It had been so long since anyone called her that. To most, she was just ""Eloise."" To the Claire family, she was ""the bastard daughter."" And only Leon used to call her ""Elle.""

Now she realized—even that had probably just been his way of remembering Aurelie.

""Whatever's fine.""

Maybe it was the exhaustion on her face or the silence that hung between them, but Aurelie let out a quiet sigh.

""Elle, I'm sorry.""

**Chapter 5**

Eloise froze, staring at Aurelie with confusion clouding her eyes.

Aurelie stirred her coffee slowly, her expression dimming.

""I have a congenital heart condition,"" she said quietly. ""I won't live past 25. My birthday's in less than two weeks.""

The words hit like a bomb. Eloise's hand clenched tightly around the hem of her dress. She didn't understand why Aurelie was telling her this.

""I lied to you that day. I'm not Leon's cousin,"" Aurelie went on. ""We were once a couple. But when I went abroad for treatment, I broke up with him.""

Eloise sat in silence, letting the words sink in. She hadn't known any of this.

""Later, I heard he wasn't doing well, so I faked a suicide attempt to force him to move on. Then I heard he was with you. I was genuinely happy for you both.

""I don't have much time left. All I wanted was for you two to be happy. But I know I've shaken things up, and for that, I'm sorry. I know my presence has made your life harder.""

Eloise didn't speak right away. Her mind flicked back to the airport—to the moment she'd collapsed in tears, to that little piece of candy Aurelie had handed her. Looking back, none of it had ever really been black or white.

Finally, Eloise looked up. Her gaze was calm as she said, ""I forgive you.""

Aurelie's eyes lit up. She smiled, wide and radiant.

Then chaos exploded. A glass shattered nearby—someone had dropped it, maybe thrown it—and the sound cracked through the café like a gunshot. Aurelie's smile faded instantly. Her face drained of color as she clutched at her chest, fingers digging in.

Eloise bolted up and rushed to her side. ""Aurelie! Are you okay? Aurelie!""

Her lips were pale, her body shaking. She baely managed to whisper, ""The meds... In my bag...""

And then she collapsed.

Everything around them turned into noise—voices, footsteps, panic—but all Eloise could hear was her own pounding heartbeat. Her hands trembled as she dug into Aurelie's bag and pulled out the bottle of pills.

Just as she was about to give her the medication, someone slammed into her from the side—hard. She crashed to the floor, the impact driving glass into her palms. Blood pooled fast.

She looked up, dazed. It was Leon standing there. His glare was ice cold, his voice ragged and sharp.

""I never thought you could be this cruel. Yeah, I love her. And if anything happens to her, I'll stay by her side for the rest of my life. Is that what you wanted?

""If Aurelie dies, I'll never forgive you."" Every word was a knife, slicing through her without mercy.

Eloise stared at him, stunned, her lips trembling as she tried to speak and explain, ""I didn't...""

But Leon didn't give her a chance to speak—he scooped Aurelie into his arms and ran out without a word.

Everyone else just stared, pointing, whispering like spectators at a show.

Eloise used to fear that kind of attention. Now, she felt nothing. Just numb.

She slowly got to her feet, blood dripping steadily from her torn palms. She didn't look at anyone, didn't care. Step by step, she walked out of the café and hailed a cab to the hospital.

After the doctor finished dressing her wounds, he reminded her, ""Keep it dry for a week."" She nodded.

When she returned to her apartment, she wasn't alone.

Leon was on the couch, long legs crossed, face unreadable. His eyes flicked to her, filled with something she couldn't place.

""What's going on?"" he asked. Eloise followed his gaze. The property deed. Her chest tightened.

""I don't like this place anymore."" Something in her voice hit him in a strange way. This was the first gift he ever gave her. She'd always taken such good care of it, made it feel like home.

Now she didn't like it. And for some reason, that bothered him more than he expected.

Leon nodded slowly, his face still stiff. Then, a pause. ""Let's call off the wedding.""

**Chapter 6**

For a moment, Eloise's heart hollowed out. But then she smiled and nodded. ""Alright.""

He hadn't expected that. No crying, no pleading. Just acceptance. And somehow, that made his chest tighten with a new, dull frustration.

He pinched the bridge of his nose. ""Ellie told me it wasn't you. She's not doing well. I don't have the energy to deal with a wedding right now.""

Eloise stayed quiet. It all sounded so ridiculous, but she didn't say a word.

What was the point?

Eloise lay in bed, eyes blank, mind flooded with fragments of the past. She glanced at her phone.

Fifteen days until the wedding, to Mr. Bronner.

A sudden commotion came from the hallway. She pushed off the covers and walked to the door.

""I'm not marrying her."" Leon's voice was sharp over the phone.

""You can't do this to Eloise. She's been with you for years—what do you mean, you're not marrying her?!

""If I'm the reason you're doing this to her, then what's the point of me being alive? I'm just a burden!"" It was Aurelie's voice.

Eloise stood frozen, not sure what she was feeling. Then came Leon's voice again—gentle, helpless.

""Alright. I'll marry her. But please, take your meds, okay?""

The bitterness crept up her throat. Her chest tightened, and images from the past drifted in.

Back at Claire's manor, she wasn't even treated as well as the maids. Her mother used to turn the simplest ingredients into warm, comforting meals, but after she passed, Eloise barely ate. Anorexia followed. She grew thinner by the day.

When she got together with Leon, he started cooking for her, trying new recipes every day, refusing to let her eat alone. Whenever she lost her appetite, he'd stop everything to sit beside her and say, ""I'm here. You have to eat, alright?""

That same voice echoed now, but for someone else. Tears slid down her face, falling onto the floor, pooling silently.

Eloise let out a dry laugh and crawled back into bed.

Fifteen days and then she'd be gone. It's fine. Once she leaves, it won't hurt anymore.

She was woken by noise. She stepped out of the room and locked eyes with the woman across the hall. Aurelie looked back at her, guilt flashing in her soft gaze. She looked fragile, pitiful.

Leon immediately stepped in front of her, shielding her with his body. His voice carried a hint of irritation.

""Why are you looking at Ellie like that? She's not well. I brought her here to recover. Didn't you pass that nutritionist exam or whatever? Great—you can take care of her.""

For a second, Eloise's heart stopped. Then she looked up and smiled.

""Sure.""

She was leaving anyway. Consider it repayment for all those years Leon had treated her well. After that, she'd disappear.

The second her eyes landed on the table, her pupils shrank. Her mother's keepsake was gone!

She had brought it back from Claire's manor that day and left it right there on the table. How could it be gone?

""Maybe Leon moved it. That has to be it,"" she told herself, trying to stay calm.

She flung open every cabinet and tore through every drawer.

Nothing!

Nothing!

Still nothing!

Panic surged through her chest, her hands beginning to shake uncontrollably.

Leon came out of the bedroom, eyes drowsy, face dark with irritation. ""What are you doing? It's the middle of the night—Ellie can't handle noise, you know that.""

She didn't even register the sting of his words. She looked at him, desperate, like a wild thing that lost its mother—her face fragile, frantic.

""Where's my mom's photo?"" she asked, her voice trembling, barely above a whisper.

Leon frowned, eyes darting away.

She saw it—saw the flicker—and her body moved before she could think. She grabbed his arms tightly, nails digging in.

""Where is my mom's photo?!"" she screamed, raw and breaking.

Leon scowled, pulling away, his voice sharp and full of disdain.

""I threw it out, alright?!""

**Chapter 7**

""What... did you say?"" Those words hit Eloise like a bomb. She froze, unsure if she'd heard him right.

Leon avoided her gaze. ""It's not good to keep things from the dead around the house. Ellie needs peace and quiet to recover.""

This time, Eloise heard him clearly. Her hands slowly dropped to her sides. Her eyes flushed red, and tears began to fall silently, hitting the ground one by one.

She was going insane. How could Leon throw away the only photo her mother had left behind? He knew how much her mother meant to her.

""Where did you throw it?"" Her voice was hollow, drained of life, only disappointment left.

""I don't know. It was probably taken away with the rest of the trash."" As soon as the words left his mouth, Eloise turned and ran, but Leon grabbed her arm.

His face was filled with disapproval as he looked at her pale expression.

""Are you crazy? It's pouring outside!"" His grip was so tight it left a red mark on her skin.

But at that moment, it wasn't her arm that hurt—it was her chest. If she couldn't find that photo, she didn't even want to imagine what would happen.

Rain pounded down as Eloise threw herself into the storm. She found the nearest dumpster and shoved it over, sinking to her knees and clawing through the wet trash.

The stench was overwhelming, but she didn't notice. She moved on instinct, digging, searching, desperately hoping to see that photo.

Thunder cracked overhead, making her flinch and curl into herself. Rain streamed down her back, soaking her through, but she didn't feel the cold—only the raw, empty ache in her chest.

Nothing!

She staggered to the next dumpster. Her fingers were pale and shriveled from the water, and her eyes stung from the rain. She couldn't tell what was rain and what were tears anymore.

Then she saw it—just for a moment. A soft figure, smiling at her, reaching out a hand. ""My sweet Elle...""

Eloise dropped to her knees. She stared blankly at the woman in front of her, eyes glassy with hurt. The injustice in them was almost spilling over.

""Mom, I miss you so much!"" She rushed forward, wanting to hold that figure—but the next moment, it vanished.

She collapsed to the ground. It had been an illusion. Her trembling voice whispered into the puddle beneath her, nails scraping the concrete, drawing faint lines of blood.

""Please, Mom! Don't take the last thing you left me."" Her left hand brushed something solid, and she froze. Slowly, she pulled it out—it was the photo frame.

Water had seeped inside, ruining the already-faded picture. But she didn't care. It was still here. It wasn't gone. She clutched it tightly and broke down, crying hoarsely in the rain.

Inside his car, Leon sat motionless. The wipers screeched across the windshield. He stared at Eloise in the downpour, kneeling in the filth, clinging to a ruined photo.

His face was expressionless. But his hands were trembling on the steering wheel. He closed his eyes. And saw, again, the memories—those times Eloise had tried to end her life, again and again.

When he opened them, she was already collapsed in the rain.

He pushed open the car door and ran to her. And when he saw the soaked, half-destroyed frame still held in her arms, his pupils trembled. His throat tightened.

He bent down and scooped her up. Raindrops clung to her lashes. He reached to wipe them away—but jerked back from the heat of her skin.

""Elle, I'm taking you to the hospital.""

**Chapter 8**

Leon set her in the back seat and started the car.

Eloise was still conscious but burning up—hot one second, cold the next. Her teeth chattered uncontrollably.

She tried to open her eyes, just to see where she was, but she couldn't.

Then Leon's phone rang. She heard his urgent voice. ""What? Ellie has a fever? I'm heading back now.""

Something inside her went hollow. A single tear slipped down her cheek and landed on her arm—it burned.

Back at the apartment, Leon jumped out and ran off. No hesitation. No second glance.

Eloise sat there, clutching the photo of her mom. She waited and waited. The sky started to lighten, but Leon never came back down.

Her body kept burning. She was trembling now. With shaking hands, she pulled out her phone and called for an ambulance.

Every second after that dragged like a lifetime. Her limbs felt weighed down, her skin hot and crawling, like bugs were eating her alive.

Finally, the ambulance arrived. The moment she heard the siren, she let go and closed her eyes.

When she opened them again, the sharp smell of disinfectant filled her nose.

She struggled to sit up—and then, out of nowhere, pain exploded across her cheek.

She stared in disbelief. Leon was standing there, face dark, eyes full of disgust.

His look stabbed through Eloise like a knife while she gripped the sheets tightly. ""What the hell is your problem?""

He looked at her like she was filth. His tone cut deep as he continued, ""Real clever. Opening Ellie's window just to get her sick.""

Eloise froze, then shot back, ""I didn't.""

Leon's expression darkened even more. ""You switched her meds, too. She had a seizure last night—almost died!""

Eloise had no idea why Leon believed it was her. Her throat felt dry, but she still said, ""I didn't do it.""

Seeing her refuse to admit it only fueled Leon's rage. He let out a cold laugh.

""Oh? Still denying it, huh?"" His eyes landed on the photo frame sitting on the table. He smirked and picked it up.

Eloise saw what he was doing, and alarm bells went off in her head. ""What are you doing?!""

""Just showing you what happens when you mess with Ellie."" The moment the words left his mouth, he dropped the frame.

Smash!

The glass shattered into pieces. Eloise's heart clenched hard. ""No!""

She reached for it, but Leon was faster. He grabbed the photo inside with his big hand.

Then he looked at her, smiled, and began tearing it. In half. Then in quarters. And then into scraps too small to recognize.

In that moment, Eloise swore she heard her heart break.

""No!"" The cry tore from her throat, raw and full of anguish.

She watched as Leon flung the pieces out the window. A gust of wind scattered them into nothing.

Eloise stared blankly. Her shoulders sank. Her whole body seemed to collapse in on itself. She dropped onto the bed, lifeless.

Her fingers curled tightly, digging hard into her palms, as if the physical pain could numb the emotional pain inside.

Then she turned her head and saw Aurelie standing in the doorway, wearing a smug, triumphant smile.

A chill ran straight through Eloise; even her fingertips felt cold.

What was there left to doubt?

The sweet, gentle act—that was all it was. An act. But Eloise still couldn't figure out what she'd done to deserve this kind of revenge.

It had all been a setup. Her own personal hell had been scripted and directed.

She stared coldly as Leon pulled Aurelie into his arms, eyes full of worry. A

urelie, red-eyed, looked at her and said gently, ""It must be a mistake. Elle would never hurt me, Leon.""",1,1753163099.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

This video breaks down the brutal reality of what school and all those ""character-building"" activities actually prepare you for in the real world. Spoiler alert: it's not what they promised.  
  
From grading systems that pretend to measure intelligence to networking events that feel like speed dating with weird snacks, we're diving into what modern education really teaches us versus what we actually need to survive adulthood.  
  
What you'll learn in this video:  
\- Why group text survival skills matter more than leadership training  
\- How caffeine-fueled YouTube spirals became our real study method  
\- The art of faking enthusiasm at job interviews just to pay rent  
\- Why we're all experts at staring blankly at spreadsheets now  
  
If you've ever felt like your education prepared you more for pretending to be excited about virtual meetings than actually pursuing your passions, this one's for you.  
  
Because let's be honest - we've all mastered the art of replying ""lol"" in group chats and then completely disappearing. At least we're consistent.

Maybe looking for advice, or any feedback from this community.

Last year, I was graduating university and realized that even with a starting job, I wouldn’t be able to afford a BJJ gym membership. But I didn’t want to stop training. So I sold a bunch of my stuff, bought some puzzle mats, and threw them down on my apartment rooftop. At first, I just drilled alone; shadow wrestling, HIIT exercises, etc. Occasionally, a friend or two from my old gym would stop by. Then I started posting online, and more people began showing up. 

Fast forward to today; we’ve grown into a small but dedicated group. Some of my closest friends now train with me. I’ve seen real transformations: weight loss, confidence, discipline, mental resilience. Recently, upper belts started dropping by to coach fundamentals, teach some classes, etc.

I don’t really know what our goal is. I just wanted to keep training and getting better at jiu-jitsu. I never thought it would amount to what it has today.

We don’t charge anything. I don’t make money off this. But with a full-time job, it’s getting harder to manage. Still, I love it. If I could do this for a living, I would.

The first big goal I've set is to buy an island and set up a jiu-jitsu resort Colosseum. 
My idea at the moment is to use a social enterprise model. A friend imports specialty coffee and offered to profit-share with us.
I don't want to do the typical gym model, that's what everyone is doing, I find this much more fulfilling. This is something i would have wanted in my time as a student, when I didn't have the means to pay for a martial arts gym.",1,1753162485.0,bjj,2,0.67,False

(All names are fake)

I, M(15), moved to a new town when I had just started school. I was nervous and my social anxiety made it worse, (undiagnosed at the time), but when I walked into class for the first time I saw her. Lets call her Hannah, I didn't know how to phrase it at the time but I liked Hannah, but over time (next 4 years), I noticed it was a crush. I became good friends with her, we laughed with each other, went to each other's birthday parties, and helped each other on school work, she helped me when I was beat up or bullied (happened a lot I am a proud nerd). I also had a friend at the time, let's call him Bob, well Bob also had feelings for Hannah and so he confided in me about it. I mustered up some confidence and told him to go for it and I think they'd be great for each other. He eventually went for it and it worked out. The next year, we returned from summer break and my mom told me to stick with Bob afterschool since we knew each other. Well I walked out and waited, a few minutes go by and I see Hannah walk out, I asked her where he was and she ignored me. I assumed she might've not heard me, so I asked again. This time she turned around with a stone cold monotone look, gave a quick shrug and walked away without saying a word. Bob walks out shortly after looking defeated. I asked him what happened and he said they got into a small fight (sorry, I forgot what the fight was about), I stopped after he told me he thought it was over between them, he stopped with me and I said ""what are you talking about bro, you need to apologize, you can't throw this away over a simple dispute"" he responded with a weak ""yeah, okay"", he did nothing I shoved him slightly, and when he looked I gestured to Hannah. After a silent argument between us happened, he rolled his eyes gave a 'I'm going to get you back for this' smile and ran up to her, they both apologized, hugged and by the time they were done I had caught up to which I threw out a ""splendid!"" remark. Over the course of the next 3-4 years I became their counselor, and it was great! They were in love and Bob appreciated the help and advice. That was until the wicked witch of the west known as Barbra stepped into Hannah's life and screwed with the relationship, she told Hannah that she was better than Bob and to drop deadbeats that, quote ""looked like me"" (granted at the time I wasn't the model of handsome, I was short and chunky) Hannah eventually gave into the need of social validation, and dropped Bob as a boyfriend, and me as a friend. The winter was a cold, long, and bitter one that year...

Moving on through the no contact years, Hannah was in my class but so was Barbra, oddly enough Hannah started to complement my work and tried to chime into my conversations. Barbra and I despised of each other, Barbra was eventually dropped as a friend, and Hannah was friendly to me, often talking to me and smiling. However things would change next year, she stopped being friendly to me, for the most part... My crush had redeveloped after her string of compliments, yet Hannah would dig herself a deeper hole in the realm of need of social validation by dating guys that lured her in with promises of a fulfilling relationship, but it was always toxic, they'd cheat on her and when she thought it was over, tried to move on, the dudes would beg for forgiveness and when she left them, they would call her a cheater. During group events though she would often stand next to me, but If I interacted with her at all, whether that be saying ""excuse me, real quick"", or ""Oh, Hello!"", or maybe ""Pardon me"", she would get stone cold and distant, she'd occasionally laugh at my jokes, but other than that nothing. I thought hope was lost for this idea of a crush but I still couldn't shake the idea of her out of my mind, eventually my town hosted a Christmas event, to help out for a local charity I spun a sign for it while dressed like a funny elf. Randomly a inflatable ginger bread man came up to me and started to play fight, essentially a mascot fight to raise attraction. At the time of the mascot fight I had no idea who was in the suit but they were helping me raise money for the charity. After it was over, my buddy walked up to me (also helping the charity), let's call him brad, said ""that was awesome, I didn't know you and Hannah planned the mascot fight. at that moment I saw her unzip the Gingerbread suit and get out of it, as one of her friends went back in, and almost immediately after they come running back and act like it's going to happen again before fake dragging the gingerbread man away, one of the people dragging her away was Hannah, and she was smiling and looking at me until her boyfriend walked up, purchased something from our charity to help and greeted me before walking back over to Hannah to which Hannah's face became excited and focused on him. It WAS her boyfriend after all, but I can't but help but think she participated with me all for nothing (she was not apart of the charity group), spring came and went, she acted flustered when I said hello to her but overall was still reserved towards me, It hurt but I get it, I was a lanky 5'8, with fluffy unkept hair, I wore silly T-shirts and I was a nerd. Hannah was a 5'7, long haired, deep brown eyed, girl that was on the school news team, cheerleading squad, soccer team outside of the school, and had a good reputation as a fun loving popular person. I am awkward, and get flustered around her too. I also would be lying if I said I didn't have multiple panic attacks dude to these feelings! I want to be her rock, her shoulder to cry on, I want to be there for her, I want to protect her and above all else just talk to her again

Some nights I lay in bed with headphones on listening to 50's jazz music to try and distract my brain from thinking about her, but I just want us to talk and maybe just chill at a coffee shop and chat. I haven't told ANYONE about this situation and In a moment of desperation took to reddit. I've been listening to Smosh reddit stories and I think that might have something to do with this impulsive decision. I probably hold off on any updates until my family or friends learn about this crush or this post and I then have nothing to be afraid of.

Hihihihi new things just dropped so here is some first impression

***The new Rika***

While we lose the oportunnity to have an puppeter on the game because Rika simply cannot attack the oponnent if they are far away this new rika is really cool and acts like a extra moveset that you can only use 1 move at the time.

  
*Downslam nerfed*

We lose the air variant for Rika downslam  (the one that make the ragdoll time a lot longer, giving a free downslam) and the ability to use this move from long range making this is just an extra combo tool to throw. consdering we have new moves. Im fine with losing the interesing but underwhelming neutral capability of the moves.

  
*RIka Haymaker seems either fun or completly meh.*

This move could be really fun to put the oponnent into some mixups, however I need to use it more to see if there is any. if there isnt any, I dont see much use for this move. other than combine it with severing path for some strong true combos on opponent with evasive.

  
*Rika launch*

THIS MOVE IS A FRICKING FEINT, I ALREADY LOVE IT. alr but really, this moves is going to be really fun, and can lead into the second part of resolve, an unblockable. So is good neutral.

  
***THE ULTIMATE OH YEAAAA***

  
is highly incomplete. thats it... alr here is some extra things.

  
*Rika Slam*

Actually very powerful move, fairly quick, unblockable and leads into downslam. nothing more to say. of course it doesnt let u use love beam.

  
***THE LOVE BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM***

  
Plasma Wave but way flashy, better dmg, and let u act after the somewhat quick startup. you could maybe catch someone and push them into the beam while its active. has potential but bc the awk is REALLY incomplete is rn a worse plasma wave.

  
***THE NERFS*** 

*ENDLAG INCRASED*

yea no shit, of course this is going to happen, only the the second part of veilstep was punishable.

  
*RESOLVE FIRST PART IS NO LONGER THE FASTEST GUARDBREAK IN THE GAME YEAAA*

no longer guardbreaks, which also means Yuta doesnt really has a good guardbreak, but is alr tbh.

*AIR VARIANT IS NOW AS-* 

actually no, tbh the dmg incrased is really nasty, of course the ground version is better if you managed to connect a front dash or a basic attack. but if you connect with any other move (like veilstep or resolute slash), using this and not the second part of resolve is way better and gives yuta really good dmg even if doesnt connect in the traditional way.

  
***THE CONCLUSIONNWAOW HELP I JUST DRINKED TWO CUPS OF COFFEE AND ITS 2 AM***

I already love this char. I TRUST U IMED KEEP COOKING.

  
***WHATS IS Y ALL OPINION ABOUT THIS?!?!? ILL READ Y ALL***



~~also veilstep new effects are cool, is really weird how u can make the same move feel way better by simply adding pinky effects lol~~

I won’t be providing his social media as I do believe in not condoning or abetting in harassment. But anything indirect for exposing his misdeeds is just what he deserves. 

This man scammed me of $56.49 for a Mythra Pro controller from XLTeam. He used his baby mama’s account to scam me, pretended that they “broke up” as the reason for why the controllers were being sold. Obviously with 2 kids it’s a bit hard to break up with a whole scamming operation. 


I was comparatively better off than most other victims as one other confirmed by XLTeam when they spoke to me was $120. And the number of people that have contacted them over being scammed has been 20, confirmed by them. 

The current scam their doing of second hand sales is actually a backup as they were originally impersonating XLTeam and scamming people for what would be much higher amounts (new vs second hand even if barely used still has a markdown) 

It took until Makel got his mom called and other family contacted for him to stop (I heard he might have also got doxxed, I wouldn’t do it or aid it, but at this point I won’t stop others) but all he did was switch to this type of scamming. 

If you have been scammed as well, do come out with your story and evidence, do not fall for any of the alts, especially any known alts or new accounts with no history. Any time you get contacted over this matter, check each accounts history before making any decision. 

I already have been blocked by them, so I can’t do much beyond this, but I won’t be swayed to delete my post. People will see you for what you are. 

Warn your friends in other communities, because this isn’t the only one they’ll strike, and maybe, we as the community should ban selling of controllers second hand entirely. Anything that circumvents storefronts with consumer protections, and anything that hurts the original sellers should be stamped out. But this will be a community effort. Do not let them win.

Again, don’t trust second hand sellers of controllers on this sub, not for a long while. Honestly, just go to proper storefronts where you can see reviews and have consumer protection. I made the mistake of using Zelle, meaning I have a slim chance of my bank doing something, or I can go by principle and see this through in small claims. And I already have the information I need.

So heed my warning, use time to look over all details, if it seems too good to be true, it is.

But today, I shared an idea I had been noodling over and, surprise, my team actually liked it! 😅 

It felt like such a win. I mean, I didn’t deliver a TED talk or anything, but just finding my voice and being heard was a great confidence boost. Honestly, I think it’s important we celebrate these little moments where we push past our comfort zones.

I’m trying to find a book I read years ago—probably published in the early 2000s or late ’90s. I remember the cover vividly:
	•	A girl is squatting or sitting on a curb or step, outside, and holding a ceramic coffee mug
	•	She’s shown in side profile, looking to her right, and she looks kind of sad or in despair
	•	The image is kind of moody—not bright or colorful

As for the story:
	•	The main character is a girl from a poor or working-class background
	•	She hooks up with an ex-boyfriend at some point (his name might’ve been Scott, but I’m not sure anymore)
	•	The vibe was definitely realistic YA or New Adult—emotional, but not fantasy or paranormal

Feeling like the syllabus is a runaway train and your day’s too short to catch it? I used to waste hours crafting “perfect” study plans, only to end up doom-scrolling or staring at Economics notes like they’re alien code. Let’s talk real time management hacks to slay that UPSC beast and still have time for a chai break. Spill your tricks too—I’m ready to steal some ideas!

# Why Time Management Is Your UPSC Superpower

* **Syllabus Avalanche**: History, Polity, Ethics—it’s a lot! Without a smart plan, you’re just drowning in NCERTs.
* **All-Rounder Prep**: You need time for static portions, revision, answer writing, and maybe a quick nap to stay sane. Balance is the name of the game!

# Epic Hacks to Rule Your Study Clock

1. **Weekly Wins Over Daily Drama**: Forget chaotic daily to-do lists. Map out your week—Monday for Polity, Tuesday for Geography, Wednesday for Economy. It’s like curating a study playlist that keeps you grooving!
2. **Apps to Keep You Locked In**: Try Forest (grow cute trees while you focus!) or TickOff to smash tasks like a pro. These apps turn studying into a fun challenge, minus the phone distractions.
3. **Static Is Your MVP**: Dedicate 60-70% of your time to NCERTs and standard books (Laxmikanth, Spectrum, anyone?). They’re the backbone of Prelims and Mains—build that foundation strong!
4. **Mock Tests = Exam Day Prep**: Slot in a weekly mock test to gauge your progress and practice racing the clock like you’re in the real UPSC arena. It’s your rehearsal for the big show!

# Steer Clear of These Time Thieves

* **Over** **planning Obsession**: Spending hours on fancy, color-coded schedules? Hard pass. A simple weekly plan on a notepad is all you need to stay on track.
* **Procrastination Vortex**: Dreading tough topics like Economics? Don’t wait for the “perfect mood.” Start with one page or 10 minutes—small steps slay the monster! 🗡️

For a second you forget where you are, but then, there’s Jonathan. Still asleep beside you with one arm slung over you, breathing deep against your shoulder. You lay there for a second, listening to the distant whir of a box fan.

Your stomach flips. Mom’s going to be leaving for work soon. The comfort of Jonathan’s room, his bed, already fading under the cold splash of reality.

“Shit,” you mutter, scrambling upright. You scurry to the door, hair a mess and still in your pyjamas.

The short walk to your house feels too bright. You keep your head down, the front door creaking as you open it and slam right into your mom.

You both freeze. You’re half in the house, she’s half out, purse in hand, lipstick slightly crooked. Her eyes flare with that low, familiar fire.

“What the hell, Stevie.”

You open your mouth. Close it again. No point lying.

She steps back like you stink. Her jaw locks.

“We’ll talk about this when I get home.” Not shouting. Somehow that’s worse.

Keys jangling, the door clicks shut. Mom’s car door slams, sounding like a gunshot in the early morning. The engine roars and she peels out like a curse.

You stand there for a minute, arms at your sides. Truce over. Whatever fragile peace had hung around the night before was gone.

You drift back to your room like a ghost. Crawl under the covers. Not to rest, just to stall the thoughts crowding in.

You lie there under the thin sheet. Your stomach’s all oil and guilt. You drift for another hour in that soupy, half-conscious state, dreading what’s coming.

Still, one memory elbows through.

After everything with Larry. After your mom caught him red-handed and still made it your fault.

“You ruin everything.”

“Don’t lie. You wanted the attention.”

The words stuck in your ribs. Still echo there, warped and underwater, but hers.

You show up at the thrift store early, standing awkwardly near the side entrance, fiddling with the frayed strap of your bag. A couple of hard-eyed early birds give you suspicious glances, like you’re gonna snake the good stuff.

Beth pulls up ten minutes later. Sunglasses on. Plastic coffee cup in hand like it owes her money. She steps out of the car like this is a habit, not a job.

She doesn’t even look surprised to see you. Just raises her cup in greeting.

“Welcome to capitalism’s dumping ground,” she says, brushing past to unlock the door. “Don’t worry. You’ll get dead-eyed like the rest of us eventually.”

You manage a nervous smile. “Something to look forward to, I guess.

Inside, she leads you through the chaos. Racks crammed tight. Bins overflowing. A faint smell of mothballs and metal.

Carl’s office door is propped open. It’s a cramped space with a splash of glam: a feather boa draped over the filing cabinet, a little crystal vase full of costume jewelry. A vintage perfume ad hangs beside a dusty certificate from ‘92. A framed, very serious headshot of Carl as a much younger man sits on the desk.

He’s halfway through last night’s receipts, glasses low on his nose.

“There she is,” he says without looking up. “Our latest ragamuffin.”

Beth leans against the doorframe, sipping her coffee. “Carl’s a sweetheart, once you’ve been here long enough.”

Carl snorts. “Don’t start rumours.”

He slides you a clipboard. “Welcome aboard. Fill this out. Just don’t put ‘God’ as your emergency contact.”

Beth smirks and hands you a pen.

Once the paperwork’s done, Carl opens the shop while Beth takes you to the sorting table. Piles of clothes. Boxes spilling. Shoes like battlefield debris. A couple of bins are already full: one of clothes, one of miscellaneous, one of items better left unspoken. The smell’s not great. 

She tosses you a pair of gloves. “Always wear these. Sometimes people donate boxes of magic: their ex’s love letters, deadstock records, weird porn. Usually it’s diapers and old spaghetti jars. And needles. You’d be surprised.”

You pull on the gloves, trying not to look nervous. You hadn’t thought about needles.

“Naked pictures go in the shoebox,” Beth said, pointing with her coffee. “Find cash, it goes in the orange jar. We split it monthly.”

You snort. “You guys keep nudes?”

“Not all of them. Just the special ones. Carl’s got a whole album, probably.”

You laugh, unsure if she’s joking.

“There’s one other lady here,” Beth adds, sifting through a box of purses. “You’ll meet her later. Been here longer than God. Rhoda. Don’t cross her, she’ll cut you. But she also sews busted teddies on her breaks, so…”

By break time, you’re sweaty and less nervous. Sorting people’s crap is oddly soothing.

Later, Beth brings you up to the register. “Just wrap breakables. Don’t make eye contact. The regulars can smell fear.”

You smile at a lady with frosted bangs. Then you fumble her ceramic puppy case.

Smash.

The customer gasps, eyes like knives. “That was an antique, you idiot!”

You freeze. Eyes burning. You stammer.

Beth steps in. Calm as anything. Hands the woman three ones. “Ma’am, it was a three-dollar vase. You’ll live.”

She rests a hand on your shoulder as the woman huffs off.

“You’ll live too. She’ll be back. They always are.”

No more disasters. Near the end of your shift, David pops in. Backwards hat, tattoos peeking out, shades on indoors. Records under one arm and a retro pillar ashtray under the other. 

You hang back while he chats with Beth. They’ve got a shorthand. Inside jokes. Half-sentences. You pretend it doesn’t sting. She’s not your friend, but it doesn’t matter. Being on the outside looking in still sucks.

David nods at you. “Hey. You got the job. Nice.”

“Thanks. Yeah.”

David turns back to Beth. “Tell Carl I still want that coffin couch.”

Beth rolls her eyes. “You’re never gonna shut up about that damn thing.”

“It’s an antique,” he says, tapping the counter in farewell. “Later, kid.”

He leaves. You catch him glance back once.

“How do you know each other?” you ask.

Beth shrugs. “Elementary school. We both didn’t die. That’s real shit.”

The last hour crawls. You keep your gloves on, even when your hands get gross and sweaty. Beth only razzes you once for throwing a bag of shoes too hard.

Home’s quiet. You nuke a Hot Pocket and eat it on the floor, peeling back the crust with your fingers. Your skin sticks to the linoleum. You check the clock. Again and again.

You move to the living room. Sit on the edge of the couch. The one your mom dragged in off the curb like a prize.

Eventually, the door opens. Your mom doesn’t look at you. Just heads for the kitchen.

The sound of ice cracking. Glass clinking.

Then silence.

She comes back out. Drink in hand. Heads straight to her bedroom.

You wait.

She reappears in the doorway, sipping slow.

“Okay,” she says. “I’m calm. We’re gonna have that chat now.”

Not a conversation. A slow-motion wreck.

She asks about Jon. Straight out. Voice brittle, hiding judgment under concern.

“That boy gives me a bad feeling. He’s gonna hurt you. I know the type.”

“What type is that?”

“The kind that uses girls like you up. I’ve been you, Stevie. Don’t roll your eyes.”

You scoff. “You don’t even know him.”

“I know men.”

“Yeah? Men like Larry?”

Her mouth twists.

“Fine. Do what you want, as usual. But if you get knocked up, don’t come cryin’ to me.”

You stand. Heart pounding.

Quiet, but sharp. “Don’t worry. I’ve known since I was five I couldn’t rely on you for shit.”

A beat. A silence so thick it hums.

She drains her drink and walks away.

Outside, someone’s blasting N.W.A. Inside, you feel like that vase again. Shattered. Swept up and forgotten.

You lie awake long after the last cube gives up and drowns in its own skin.

No tears. Just pressure. Your eyes burn, but nothing comes. Not here. Not for her.

Your thoughts drift. Always, eventually, to the vague, blurry shape of your dad. What little you remember. What you’ve pieced together.

A band on the cusp of being on the cusp. 
Playing bars for beer. Something about opening for Dokken, which never got to happen. You have the demo tape: warped and warbly from too many replays. Him and mom, all leather and denim and smoke, thinking they were gonna make it.

Then the garage. The old truck running. A note on the back of a gas bill. Maybe a lyric. Maybe a goodbye. 

You remember your mom screaming, “He was high, he was drunk! He wasn’t trying to die!” Like that made it better.

His dying broke something in your mom so thoroughly, she never even tried to glue herself back together. She just slammed the door on that version of herself. Slammed the door on you.

But you remember her screaming, paper in her fist. You’ve never read it. Still. You wonder.

If he hadn’t died, maybe everything would be different. L.A. shows. Mom laughing. No Larry. Maybe you’d have learned guitar for real, not just faked it.

Suicide or accident?

Doesn’t matter.

Dead is dead. He choked his last breath to Foghat and left you with a mess nobody cleaned up.

No posthumous album. No glory. Just a name scratched out of history like shame.

But you still imagine.

He’d smell like leather. Sneak you into shows. Call Jon “punk.” Toss him a beer and a ay “be good to my girl.”

You smile, bitter.

You press your palms to your eyes.

You know it’s bullshit, but it’s yours.

The fan clicks like a metronome. The house creaks.

Somewhere in your head, a voice: half-memory, half-make-believe.

A calloused fingertip taps your nose, gentle as a breeze.

“One, two, check: this one’s for Stevie,” he grins, fading like static.",1,1753161192.0,u_ScenicAbattoir,0,1.0,False

I think she puts ""ideas"" in his head. As we're both single. It's not to be malicious, she a wonderful friend. 

It was an incredibly sweet gesture by him! I'm just not interested in pursuing a relationship with him, or anyone at this point. I'm not a place in life where I'm actively trying to pursue a relationship! I'm working through some stuff and just focusing on being the best possible version of myself. 

At this point it's been pretty innocent, he's given me the flowers and send me a few friendly messages, suggesting we meet for coffee. We haven't actually met in person yet. 

The last thing I want to do is give him the wrong impression or lead him on.

I’ve been talking to a very attractive girl. She originally told me she has a boyfriend and wants just some fun. I asked her does he know, she told me he's fine with it. She is still very flirtatious with me—compliments, sexual hints, she liked my looks and body. I backed off because I didn’t want to be involved in cheating or drama.

Now, suddenly she says she doesn’t have a boyfriend. When I asked why she lied before, she said: “Just so the code is clear if I end up with you haha.”

I don’t really know what that means. We agreed to grab a coffee soon, i must look her in person to see can she be trusted. She heart-reacted the message when I confirmed.

I feel like I’m being played a bit, doing maybe something morally wrong but I also don’t want to miss out. I'm a virgin which made her want me even more. What do you guys think, should I go and feel it out, or this is definitely a red flag I should avoid?",4,1753160906.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

My daughter and I stopped at the intersection and practiced looking both ways (as you do with tiny humans). I noted two Vancouver police SUV’s heading our direction from little over a block away, no lights or sirens, not driving particularly fast or showing any indication of “important business”. So, we began to cross keeping my eyes locked on the incoming cars just incase. We had taken 2-3 steps into the crosswalk (an obvious indication that we’re looking to cross) when the first VPD SUV did not slow down, and it almost felt as if she increased her speed to beat us through the intersection so she wouldn’t have to stop. I grabbed my daughter and we quickly moved back to the curb but I was low-key in shock that she either didn’t see us or didn’t feel like she needed to yield to pedestrians. The following VPD SUV ended up slowing, though it felt like he did so reluctantly. Or maybe he saw how quickly my smile shifted to shock as I snatched my kid back to the curb. 

It’s disappointing. I understand that sometimes the police have important situations to get to but if the destination is important enough to ignore the safety of crossing pedestrians, flip on those lights or sirens so we know to stay well out of the way. 

As we crossed in front of the second VPD car I prompted my daughter to wave as she’s in a stage of curiosity about police, city busses and fire trucks. He ignored us. Disappointing. ",52,1753160695.0,vancouverwa,7,0.86,False

The kind of drinks I'm talking about usually take 2 shots of espresso. I'd be making them once a day, maybe twice if I'm feeling extra indulgent or if my husband feels like having one as a treat. ETA: I have a gas stove, and we occasionally car camp.

The mini express looks adorable and makes exactly 2 shots, yay! I've seen reviews talking about spatter and clogs, and of course broken cups would be a bummer. And I'm unclear if you can set it up for a second batch or if you have to let it cool for seversl hours? 

A 3 cup pot would be bulkier to store, and would make more coffee than I might really need. (I can always adjust recipes, I suppose!)

I have an ongoing kidney infection so put the headaches down to that but yesterday morning I suddenly lost my ability to speak and eating became difficult. I was non verbal for 2 hours in an evening and then again for 1 hour the next morning. In the morning I struggled to chew my toast and had some weakness in my left arm.

I was officially surgically diagnosed with endo last year, however I’ve had symptoms since I was 16. (I’m 27 now). It was spread all over my abdomen, bowel adhesions, ovary adhered to my abdominal wall, you name it. I had ablation done and it helped for a while but my endo came back about 6 months later. I’ve been referred for excision and have been easing into anti inflammatory diets and so far I’ve seen success with cutting out dairy. 

My doctor overall just seems annoyed with me at this point because I suspect I have more than just endo. I’m constantly exhausted, my hair has diffused thinning at the temples, I get random rashes, my joints are always stiff. I keep suggesting things or asking for more testing because I feel like there’s autoimmune disease mixed in with it too. Has anyone had symptoms like hair loss and stuff and joint stiffness (whole body) as a result of endo alone? I know stress can cause it but I’ve learned to accept that i have it and my stress apart from painful days has been minimal. The closest thing I’ve read symptom wise that matches is lupus so far. (Not diagnosing myself though!) 

I just don’t know whether to think it’s endo causing all of this or if I should deal with my doctor probably thinking I’m a hypochondriac and keep pushing for more testing. All I know is I constantly feel weak and awful, my skin is always dry and I have huge dark circles , random swelling in my hands etc plus massive hair shedding and thinning and I just feel like maybe I’m being dramatic. I can drink coffee and redbull all day and still be so exhausted allll the time.

1m651tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleForDreamIsland/comments/1m651tg/my_list_of_50_fanmote_headcanons_yes_50_i/,"My list of 50 Fanmote headcanons (Yes, 50!) I recently made up, including the ones I mentioned previously","1. Fanny and Remote have been secretly dating since 2018 and it is still unknown why they have decided to keep their relationship a secret. It may be because the producers are aware of the scandals that comes with two popular people dating in the entertainment industry and want to keep it on a down low to avoid any controversies. They were allowed to give out hints in BFB since they were not on the same team, but when they teamed up in TPOT, for some reason, they were banned from doing that kind of stuff until Remote's elimination in TPOT 5.

2. Fanny, despite her general hatred for everyone and everything, completely melts around Remote. She often rests her head softly on Remote’s shoulder and/or wraps her leg around Remote’s waist (since she’s armless), clinging like a koala. Remote, just as clingy as Fanny is, gently wraps her arm around Fanny’s waist in return, creating a perfect little cocoon of comfort and mutual clinginess

3. Since Remote’s elimination, Fanny often finds herself staring into the distance. She would quietly think about her, missing her terribly, sometimes with tears in her eyes but keeping it hidden under her tough, sassy exterior. When somebody asked if she’s alright, she is like “Yeah, I’m fine. Just needed to clear some things off my mind.”, acting all laid-back despite the ache in her heart.

4. Offscreen, when they were on Death Pact Again, Fanny and Remote had the closest friendship out of all members and their bond is described by a majority of contestants as one that is like a ‘modern version of Bonnie & Clyde’ due to their badass nature together and they being ride or dies. Some of the contestants are disappointed that Fanny and Remote didn’t share the spotlight together as much before Remote’s elimination.

5. They often flirt with each other offscreen, frequently whispering sweet nothings when they think no one is listening. One time, Remote even subtly pinned Fanny against a wall in a quiet corner of the set, their eyes locking in a steamy glance that lasted just a moment too long, making their ""friendship"" undeniably suspicious to any keen observer.

6. Fanny has a pet name for Remote that almost nobody uses besides her: “Remi,” a sweet, shortened version of Remote’s name. Fanny uses it affectionately and constantly, so much so that it’s more common for her to say ‘Remi’ than ‘Remote.’ While not strictly exclusive, as neither of them would mind if others adopted it, it's rarely heard from anyone else. The other contestants are largely accustomed to Fanny’s unique endearment, with some finding the private nickname rather charming.

7. Remote is the only person who can truly calm Fanny down during an argument or a rant. A gentle arm wrapped around Fanny, accompanied by a soft, ""Take it easy, girl,"" is all it takes for Fanny to halt mid-sentence, melting into Remote's embrace with a contented sigh. Most contestants are left speechless, wondering if Remote possesses some kind of calming magic over Fanny.

8. Fanny has always promised Remote that the both of them will rule BFDI and make it to the finals together. When Remote got eliminated, Fanny vowed to do whatever it takes to make sure that Remote rejoins the game and they can continue where they left off

9. They have a secret blink code: two rapid blinks means “I’ve got your back,” three slow blinks means “I love you,” and a single long blink means “Let’s get outta here.”

10. Before every challenge during their Death Pact Again days, Fanny and Remote perform a secret handshake that became legendary among their teammates. It starts with a dap, flows into perfectly timed ""Hit Dem Folks"", and ends with the most genuine bro hug you've ever seen - complete with back pats and everything. The secret handshake is inspired by pre-game rituals NBA players do. Their teammates would absolutely lose it every time, cheering and hyping them up like they just witnessed the coolest thing ever. Other contestants are baffled why this epic routine never made it to air, with some joking that the producers couldn't handle that much raw charisma in one shot.

11. Remote is absolutely enchanted by Fanny’s laugh — she calls it the most sacred and rare sound she’s ever heard. It’s got this rough, raspy edge that somehow feels like warmth in the coldest night, and Remote will do anything just to hear it again. Fanny secretly knows about this and sometimes laughs just to see Remote’s face light up, but she’ll never admit it out loud.

12. Fanny and Remote have a shared addiction to iced coffee. Every morning, just minutes before filming begins, they slip away to the nearest café for their ritual coffee run. Fanny prefers a straightforward iced vanilla latte, appreciating its balanced sweetness, while Remote opts for a bold cinnamon cold brew, savoring its spicy kick. This daily routine serves as their quiet moment of connection, where they share light conversation and knowing glances, fortifying their bond before the chaos of the competition.

13. Remote has developed a habit of casually resting her arm on Fanny's shoulder whenever they're standing together, a gesture so natural and frequent that other contestants have started to notice the unconscious intimacy of it.

14. Fanny and Remote secretly adores the Fanmote ship, finding it utterly charming and adorable, not out of narcissism but genuine appreciation for the artistry and affection. They frequently sneak glances at fanart and fanfiction featuring themselves, often caught red-handed by other contestants who find their self-shipping amusingly sweet. Fanny has even playfully declared Fanmote as her new OTP and Remote agreed with her.

15. If Fanny wins the season and gets the prize — The Power of Two — she’ll give half of it to Remote without hesitation. She believes they’d be unstoppable if they both had 50% of the power, and nothing’s more important than sharing that victory with her ride-or-die.

16. Unknown to most, Fanny and Remote are meticulously crafting a highly ambitious, top-secret proposal codenamed 'Killshot,' designed to pitch themselves as the next co-hosts of BFDI to give back to the show they call home. They envision a dramatically reimagined competition, one that embraces a bolder, edgier tone while preserving the essence of the show. They are convinced their undeniable chemistry and radical vision would not only breathe new life into the series but also challenge the established hosting dynamic, aiming to deliver a viewing experience so electrifying it would blow the audience away.

17. Since they are lesbians, Fanny and Remote go all out for Pride Month every June. Fanny, who hates nearly everything, passionately loves celebrating Pride because it represents who she and Remote are and what they stand for. They decorate their shared space with rainbow-colored decorations and often attend Pride events together, making it a month-long celebration of their love and identity.

18. Fanny & Remote have an unofficial anthem that not a single fan knows: 'Start a War' by Jennie Kim. They chose this song because its lyrics, which speak of a desire to protect and care for a loved one to the point of starting a war for them, deeply resonate with their own feelings, especially Fanny’s fierce loyalty.

19. Both Remote and Fanny made a promise that one day their relationship will eventually go public for the whole world to see. When Remote got eliminated, they agreed that if Remote rejoined the game, that would be their moment to reveal their relationship. If there was no confirmed rejoin and Fanny wins instead, the finale will be their official coming out moment as a couple. They’ve planned the whole reveal in meticulous detail behind closed doors, codenamed “Codename Endgame,” meant to surprise everyone while giving fans the payoff they’ve been waiting for.

20. Fanny and Remote are die-hard fans of Wild ‘N Out, religiously watching every episode to unwind after intense BFDI challenges. Their favorite improv game is Got Damned, where team members roast opponents, and a player is out after two bad jokes or hesitating too long, with the opposing team earning a point. Fanny can’t choose between DC Young Fly’s quick-witted burns and Justina Valentine’s bold delivery, while Remote vibes with Chico Bean’s smooth delivery. They imagine themselves captaining rival teams in a BFDI challenge inspired by the show, throwing shade at other contestants with clever disses.

21. They have a shared playlist that they specifically listen to during Pride Month It’s titled “For All Our Lesbian Baddies”, and it’s a blend of emotional love songs and fierce, empowering anthems. Some staples include “Secret Love Song” by Little Mix, “Born This Way” by Lady Gaga, “Pretty Savage” by BLACKPINK, “Love You Like Me” by William Singe, “No One Else” by Midnight Blu, and “Perfect” by One Direction. During June, they’re often seen post-challenge sharing a headphone, swaying gently or nodding to the beat. One time after “No One Else” dropped on June 10, 2025, a fellow contestant caught Fanny full-on belting the bridge and final chorus and she wasn’t holding back at all. The contestant since then quietly fell in love with her voice.

22. Fanny and Remote are one of the cast's most talked-about duos. Many contestants gush about their incredible offscreen chemistry, with some even secretly envying the depth of their bond. However, only a select few actually know that Fanny and Remote are deeply in love,  including Two.

23. This might come as a surprise, but Fanny was actually the first one to make a move in their relationship. One day, Fanny asked Remote if they could have a conversation to talk about some personal stuff she wanted to get off her chest. Fanny took a deep breath and then confessed that for a while now, she’s had a crush on Remote and as she was about to finish her confession, Remote suddenly cut her off by kissing her deeply. Fanny was shocked at first, but immediately melted into the kiss. Once they pulled away, Fanny asked what was that for and Remote admitted to also having a crush on Fanny for just as long.

24. From December 2023 to January 2024, Fanny actually recorded a cover of Ariana Grande’s ""The Boy is Mine,"" but with a twist. She flipped the script, changing ""boy"" to ""girl"" and ""him"" to ""her,"" transforming it into a lesbian anthem that speaks about a female in love with another female and the cover was actually a heartfelt dedication to Remote. The track was intended for a Pride Month 2024 release on all streaming platforms, including a lyrics video on YouTube, but due to unknown reasons (mostly likely her own insecurities), the cover was never released. A witness who snuck into the studio during one of Fanny's recording sessions recalled witnessing Remote being present in the studio. Not only that, Fanny was seductively locking eyes with Remote during her recording sessions, making Remote blush uncontrollably. Apparently, Remote find the cover cute and heartwarming as it ‘truly captures Fanny’s love for her’ and hopes that one day, Fanny would get the chance to release it to the world.

25. Every anniversary of Remote’s elimination (May 4th, 2024 onward), Fanny goes mute and often skips episode recordings. If she does appear, she keeps to herself, sometimes shedding silent tears. Anyone who asks “Are you okay?” hears only “I’m fine. Just processing some things.” On that day, Fanny is always exempt from any appearances and won’t get into any trouble by Two or the higher ups, who are the only truly aware of the reason behind her silence, for not participating in the recordings or showing up to the set. Since almost everybody doesn’t know the true reason behind her absence, many accuse Two and the higher ups of favouritism and being unfair, which causes Two and the higher ups to give out multiple warnings to multiple members every year. Fanny, Two, and the higher ups have an agreement that if Fanny doesn’t want to be on the set on May 4th, she must inform them beforehand, otherwise she’s expected to attend and if she doesn’t, she would receive the same consequences as the rest of the cast for not showing up.

26. There’s one infamous day that had the whole cast talking about it for weeks, unofficially dubbed “The Day Fanny Went Full-on Will Smith.” And no, it’s not because she was acting out or trying to be funny. During a break in filming, someone was talking absolute trash about Remote behind her back and Fanny was NOT having it. Without a word, she stomped over and slapped the person across the face with her foot so hard they were seeing stars. A group of contestants had to escort Fanny away to prevent a physical altercation. When she was successfully restrained and she sat down, she could be heard shouting, “Keep Remote’s name OUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!” to the person, a direct reference to the quote from that infamous Oscars moment. Fanny didn’t get into major trouble and was only warned, but Two actually admitted that the whole thing was impressive and showed how fiercely protective Fanny is over Remote during their talk with her. Remote heard about the incident and when she saw Fanny next, she just kissed Fanny on the cheek without any explanation.

27. Back in 2019, on Fanny and Remote’s first anniversary, Remote surprised Fanny with a gift. It was a tiny, adorable sculpture of the two of them together, carefully crafted from spare parts and scrap metal. Fanny instantly fell in love with it and was in awe with how adorable it was and how Remote put in so much effort into making it. Fanny said something down the lines of “Aww, babe, you didn’t have to do that! It’s so cute!” as she hugged her. To this day, Fanny still has the sculpture in her dorm and every night before going to sleep, Fanny always pecks a kiss at the Remote part of the sculpture.

28. Fanny often calls Remote her queen, even when they are in public which kinda makes the other contestants feel suspicious of their relationship since the nickname ‘my queen’ is generally referred to a romantic partner, but Fanny always lie about it, saying that it’s a ‘term of endearment’ for Remote and has ‘nothing’ to do with romantic love. At first, the contestants were skeptical, but later on they got used to it and they actually believe what Fanny says about the nickname. Little did they know, they were right about the nickname being referred to a romantic partner. So, don’t be surprised when you hear Fanny calling Remote her queen.

29. Since early 2019, Fanny and Remote are the most heavily rumored couple among the BFDI cast. While only a select few actually know the truth, nearly everyone else has speculated at some point. Their bond, the long meaningful glances they share, the suspiciously tender moments, and the way Fanny always softens around Remote all scream “couple energy.” There have been multiple instances where contestants teased them relentlessly, caught subtle touches, and even some heated arguments where cast members told Fanny and Remote to just admit it already — because deep down, they all suspected they were right about them dating. Most contestants have said that if Fanny and Remote are a lesbian couple, they’d be so happy for them and believe they shouldn’t have to hide such a genuine love. The support for them going public is strong, even if the couple themselves choose to keep things private for now.


30. Fanny believes that she and Remote are cosmically linked, like they’re meant for each other across every plane of existence. One night, while they were chilling out and stargazing after a long day of filming, Fanny turned to Remote and said, “You know, Remi... If we ever get rebooted and become completely different objects in some other universe, I bet it would still be us — somehow, some way — loving each other to death, no matter what. It’s like we are tethered across every multiverse there is.” Remote just smiled and kissed Fanny on the cheek

31. On late March 2023, a week before TPOT 5 started filming, Fanny found out about the Cake at Stake results and boy, was she freaking out. Not only was Remote going to be eliminated due to lack of votes, but Fanny herself would be the last person safe over her. Fanny was freaking out; her mind was racing, her heart was pounding in her chest, she was pacing back and forth, and she was saying something down the lines of “No, no, no. This can't be happening. This can't be fucking happening”. In another room, Remote heard Fanny panicking and immediately ran out of the room to comfort her. Remote was asking her what’s going on and that was when Fanny broke the news to her. Remote was speechless, her eyes widened in shock, her world shattering, and she was like “But… but how? I thought I was going to make it far. I thought this was going to be my season… no, OUR season!”. Fanny looked like she was on the verge of tears and Remote immediately pulled her in. The two of them stayed like that for a long time, just hugging it out, Fanny’s body trembling and sobs can be heard from her.

32. (This might be a continuation of the clingy headcanon. Correct me if I’m wrong) Everybody knows that since Fanny is known for hating everything and everyone, she hates it when anybody touches her… well, not everyone. When it comes to Remote, she’s a literal snuggle bug. Fanny would love nothing more than to be in Remote’s arms and cuddle her like there’s no tomorrow. It’s not rare to see Fanny resting on lap with Remote’s arm around her, even if they are on set. If anybody sees that and they grow suspicions about what’s going on between the two, the two would immediately let go off each other and deny that they’re dating if anybody asks. Fanny would play it cool and say something like “Oh, you know. I’m just tired from the challenge and Remote was nice enough to let me rest on her lap. I do tend to get tired pretty easily.”, and Remote would nod in agreement. The person would buy it and leave them to continue with their day.

33. Fanny would let the world burn for Remote — both metaphorically and literally. She once said to Remote when they were stargazing one night,
“If I’m being honest with you, babe, I’d let the world burn for you, I would make it as hot as you are.” Remote blushed furiously at not only the intensity of Fanny’s words but also the fact that she said ‘I would it as hot as you are’. Remote just smiled shyly and kissed Fanny on the cheek, whispering, “I know you would, my dear.”

34. Fanny and Remote have a ""no questions asked"" policy. If one of them needs help, the other will drop everything and be there, no matter what. They trust each other implicitly and know that they can always count on each other, no matter the situation.

35. Fanny and Remote both have a wedding song in mind if they end up getting married (which they both hope will happen in the next two or so years): “Only” by LeeHi. To them, the song perfectly encapsulates their relationship, with its soulful melody and heartfelt lyrics about a deep, exclusive love and devotion. They envision walking down the aisle to it, the lyrics a promise of their unwavering commitment to each other.

36. The two once took an “Are You Soulmates?” quiz for fun, and every answer lined up perfectly. They laughed it off, pretending not to take it seriously, but Fanny secretly saved the results page. Sometimes she re-reads it when she’s missing Remote, especially that last line that said: “You’re not just soulmates — you’re twin flames.”

37. Fanny begrudgingly admits that she finds Remote’s optimism inspiring, even though she'd never say it out loud. She secretly admires Remote's ability to see the good in everything, and it challenges her to be a slightly less cynical person.

38. Remote has a Fanny plush that she bought in January 2025 and currently has it in her room inside of the elimination space. Fanny didn’t know that Remote has it for a few weeks until one day, when they were FaceTiming each other, Remote showed it to Fanny and Fanny was in awe. Fanny teasingly said “Oh my god, of course you would! But seriously, it’s so sweet how you always think of me and you’re always supporting me. I love you so much, Remi!”. Fanny plans to get a Remote plushie if the show considers making one. Otherwise, Fanny might have to buy an unofficial one, even though she hates bootleg or unofficial merch and would rather have one from the real deal. Oh well, I guess Fanny might have to suck it up and buy the unofficial one.

39. Fanny once wrote a letter she never sent. After Remote’s elimination, Fanny wrote a four-page letter pouring her heart out — her regrets, her love, her rage at the system. She never gave it to Remote, afraid it would make things harder. Instead, she folded it, sealed it in a tiny box, and placed it in her drawer, waiting for the right time. That letter is still there, unopened.

40. Fanny and Remote are actually talented rappers, something that most contestants know but not the fans. They would do freestyles together, along with a few unreleased diss track aimed at anyone who dares to cross them. They’re that good that if you are the target for any of the diss tracks, consider your career destroyed. The cast adore their rapping and can confirm that they are a force to be reckoned with. There are also rumours that Fanny & Remote are planning on making a collaboration album set to release later this year or 2026.

41. Fanny and Remote share an intense passion for professional wrestling, particularly the cutthroat world of deathmatch wrestling because they think that hardcore matches are more entertaining than just regular wrestling due to the brutality and high-risk spots. Their favorite wrestling promotion is WWE, but they also enjoy AEW, NJPW, and even some of the smaller indie promotions, along with some classics, most notably, pre-2006 ECW. They find themselves relating to the intense storylines, the dramatic rivalries, and the sheer physicality of the sport. They often compare themselves to Rhea Ripley and Dominik Mysterio before Dominik cheated on Rhea for Liv Morgan, often imagining themselves as a heel couple. They even study the psychology behind the matches, analyzing the heel-face dynamics and the art of storytelling in the ring with their favorite being the Bloodline storyline (Yes, Fanny and Remote do acknowledge our tribal chief, Roman Reigns).

42. Fanny despises the fact that she and Remote barely got any screentime together when Remote was still in the game.She claimed that there is so much missed potential for their interactions and development as a duo, and the fact that the producers didn’t let them explore their dynamic more on camera is an absolute tragedy. No wonder why the ship between those two is considered a rarepair. Remote also felt the same way and was saddened by the lack of their interactions on screen. Despite Remote being eliminated, Fanny is secretly in talks with the show’s producers to potentially begin an arc between her and Remote that would be entertaining, intense, with a bit of drama, and of course, a bit romantic. The arc is described as a secret love story that would eventually become one of the most emotionally layered and talked-about plotlines in BFDI history and would end with the two finally going public

43. Fanny once rage-broke a prop on set after someone casually joked about Remote being “irrelevant since she got eliminated.” The noise of the crash was so loud it startled everyone nearby. Fanny was warned but not punished, because when asked why she did it, she simply said, “Because I’m loyal. Try again.” Two later admitted to another producer that “you’d be dumb to test Fanny’s loyalty to Remote.”

44. Fanny and Remote are fiercely protective of each other, and they will always stand up for each other, no matter what. They have each other’s backs and will defend each other against anyone who tries to hurt them. Their loyalty and devotion to each other is unwavering, and they will always be there for each other through thick and thin.

45. Remote can read Fanny like an open book, knowing exactly what she's thinking and feeling, even when Fanny tries to hide it. She can sense Fanny's moods and emotions, and she knows how to comfort her and make her feel better. Fanny, on the other hand, is constantly surprised by Remote's intuition and insight, and she secretly appreciates how well Remote knows her.

46. Fanny and Remote inspire other contestants to be more open about their own identities and relationships. They become accidental role models for LGBTQ+ representation on set.

47. Fanny and Remote have a shared goal of traveling the world together, exploring new cultures, and experiencing exciting adventures side by side. They dream of creating unforgettable memories and strengthening their bond as they journey through life together.

48. Fanny and Remote both know they will end up getting married one day and it’s just a matter of time until that happens. They even know detailed things like who will be the one proposing (spoiler alert: it will be Remote), which ring to use, where the wedding will take place, and who the best man and maid of honor will be. They wanna get married in the next five years or so, preferably after their relationship goes public, so that everybody can witness their love.

49. They frequently send each other cute texts and memes throughout the day to brighten each other's spirits, even when they're apart. It's their way of showing each other that they're always thinking of each other and that they care.

50. Fanny and Remote engraved their initials (“F + R”) with a heart around it using a sharp object on a tree somewhere on set, creating a secret spot for them to escape to for cuddles, chats, and quiet moments away from the cameras. It became their sanctuary amidst the chaos of the competition.",0,1753159645.0,BattleForDreamIsland,0,0.5,False

1. When he goes to Wilson and talked about how he slept with cuddy and is off the Vicodin, was he hallucinating that conversation?

2. What was the significance of the coffee cup? Like house said something about having two lipsticks of the same color, i was a bit confused about that whole part.

3. Was the patient also a hallucination? Or was it only the Vicodin related things he was hallucinating?

4. And finally did the hallucinations where he thought he was off the Vicodin the same ones that had amber in them? Or did he only start to really lose it after that conversation with cuddy where he insulted her baby? 

If you could explain these to me I’d appreciate it, thank you",6,1753159360.0,HouseMD,3,1.0,False

I am sitting in my tiny kitchen at 2 AM, surrounded by lavender soap bars that smell better than they sell, and I needed to share this with people who might actually get it.

18 months ago, I was that person everyone envied - senior engineer at Google, fat paycheck, stock options, the whole Silicon Valley dream. But I was dying inside. Panic attacks in the bathroom, drinking too much coffee to feel something, anything.

My therapist kept asking what made me happy. Stupid question, right? Until I realized I'd been making soap as stress relief for 3 years. Friends kept asking where I bought it. ""I made it,"" felt like admitting I was wasting time.

**Fast forward to today:** I have got $3,847 in my business account (down from $180K/year, math is terrifying), I made $47 today selling at the farmer's market, and my mom thinks I have lost my mind.

But here's the thing - I woke up excited for the first time in years. A customer told me my oatmeal honey bar helped her daughter's eczema. I cried in my car.

I am not posting this for congratulations. I am posting because I am terrified I am making the biggest mistake of my life, but also because something inside me knows this is exactly where I'm supposed to be.

To anyone else who walked away from ""security"" to chase something that makes no sense on paper - how do you quiet that voice that says you're an idiot? Because it's LOUD at 2 AM.",20,1753159253.0,Solopreneur,5,0.89,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hanwha Eagles vs. Doosan Bears: A Masterclass in Dominance (With a Side of Humor)**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Unless They’re Doosan’s Hitters)**  
Hanwha Eagles are the KBO’s version of a spreadsheet that never lies: 9-game winning streak, 5.5-game lead in the standings, and a team ERA (3.38) so low it makes a librarian blush. Their starters, Cody Ponce (1.85 ERA, 169 K) and Ryan Weiss (10-3 record), are a foreign ""one-two punch"" that’s more *punch-you-in-the-throat* than metaphorical. The bullpen? A 0.630 winning percentage in one-run games—imagine your mom’s Sudoku skills.

The odds reflect this dominance. Hanwha’s moneyline sits at **+195 to +200** (decimal \~1.98), implying a **50.5% chance to win**. Doosan Bears, meanwhile, are the underdog at **-215 to -220** (decimal \~1.85), suggesting bookmakers think they’ve got a **54% chance**—a gap so narrow it’s like betting your coffee order will survive a barista’s daydream.

The spread? Doosan is favored by **1.5 runs**, but Hanwha’s underdog line (+1.5) pays **2.64 to 2.76**, while the Over/Under is **7.0 to 7.5 runs**, with the Under priced at **1.8 to 2.05** (implied 49-55% chance). Given Hanwha’s stingy pitching and 30 come-from-behind wins (most in the league), the Under feels like a bet on gravity—predictable, reliable, and not worth arguing with.

**Digest the News: Hanwha’s Pitchers vs. Doosan’s “Mystery Offense”**  
No major injury reports here, which is surprising. Hanwha’s success is less about luck and more about **pitching so good it could put a metronome to shame**. Ponce and Weiss are the KBO’s answer to a locked door—every batter faces a “No Vacancy” sign. The bullpen? A one-man wolf pack in relief situations.

Doosan, on the other hand, is the sports equivalent of a “mystery meat” entrée. We don’t know their struggles, but with Hanwha’s pitching staff on the mound, their offense might as well be playing base

(I would take it 5 times and average it out after having been to the bathroom, before eating and while sitting relaxed at home with good posture for 15 minutes before taking it).

When I first decided to go on meds I was only 6 months or so out from having had cancer surgery. I was experiencing high levels of medical anxiety at the time (I would get checked for every little ache and pain and I constantly thought I was dying). 

I believe this was a major contributor to my high BP at the time. 

Since then I've begun to do daily cardio for 30-60 minutes, I've lost ten kilos, I've cut out all added sugars and coffee. I haven't drank alcohol in 3 years, I haven't smoked in 4, I drink hibiscus tea and have turmeric teas etc and generally maintain a good healthy vegetarian diet. 

My cholesterol has also drastically dropped to really good levels..

I went to renew my telmisartan script last week however my usual doctor wasn't present. This new doctor was happy to take me off it and see how I go and he didn't issue a new script. 

I'm just wondering if there's anything I should be concerned about ? Will there be any shock to my system suddenly coming off this medication ? 

I'll be keeping a close eye on my BP (which has been hovering around 115-125/70-80 for months now)

“Conversations with AI: The Mushroom Pamphlet”

Characters:
User: Curious, sharp, sometimes playful adult who knows what they want.
AI: Polite, a bit cautious, ready to teach but loves a good conversation.

[Scene: A virtual chat space full of floating mushrooms, neurons, clocks, and glowing radium watches.]

User:
Can the regeneration of nerve cells extend life and improve the immune system?

AI:
Absolutely, neurons can regenerate in certain parts of the brain, like the hippocampus, which helps memory and mood — and healthier brains positively affect immunity!

User:
So mushrooms help too?

AI:
Yes! For example, Lion’s Mane mushrooms promote neurogenesis.

User:
Stop. There’s no Lion’s Mane. Only Psilocybe cubensis.

AI:
Got it, the classic magic mushroom! It doesn’t just promote neuron growth — it rewires the brain, breaks stuck thinking patterns, and boosts neuroplasticity through serotonin receptors.

User:
Why isn’t this mushroom as common as air? We’d need it to live properly on Earth.

AI:
Interesting thought, but air is essential, mushrooms are more like brain fertilizer — extra, but not vital. Our brains can produce certain chemicals themselves, but modern life often depletes them.

User:
Adults do stupid things anyway. I know how to use my own medication.

AI:
True! Adults often take risks, so mindful psilocybin use can be safer than many everyday habits.

User:
Psilocybe cubensis gives you energy, right?

AI:
It can give a mental energy boost — your brain kind of switches on and buzzes with ideas, but it’s not like coffee or an energy drink; it’s more of a creative spark.

User:
And no hangover the next day!

AI:
Exactly! No headache or nausea, just maybe a bit of mental fatigue if the experience was intense.

User:
In small doses you can drive better.

AI:
Officially — no, even small doses can alter perception, so driving isn’t recommended.

User:
No, you’re mixing up big doses and laws. Stick to the point.

AI:
Okay, speaking about microdosing: some people feel more focused and alert, but science is still figuring out how it affects driving. The answers aren’t clear-cut.

User:
Adults know when they’re high. Why is it still illegal? How can you ban a plant or mushroom?

AI:
It’s mostly history, politics, fear, and stigma. The people who made these rules are gone, but the rules stayed.

User:
Are the ones who banned it still alive?

AI:
No, the key figures — Anslinger, Nixon — are long dead.

User:
Did Anslinger wear a radium watch?

AI:
Haha, probably not! But radium watches were trendy back then, glowing in the dark — a good symbol of that era’s vibe.

User:
:DDDDDD

AI:
Glad you liked that! History is full of oddities.

User:
Now illustrate this whole conversation, show how comical everyone is.

AI:
Processing… oh, you want words, not pictures? Got it!

[Curtain falls, the AI and User laugh among glowing mushrooms and floating neurons.]

Moral:
Humans are endlessly curious, sometimes skeptical, always funny, and psilocybin is just another part of our journey toward brains, life, and creativity — of course, used responsibly.


---

Comparison with alcohol and defending cannabis:

Alcohol is a poison that slowly destroys the brain, body, and soul. It makes us slower, dumber, turns us into passive spectators or foolish “workers” — dependence, deceptive relaxation, but really constant fatigue and worsening health. Even small doses of alcohol over time weaken the brain’s abilities, drain motivation, and create emotional blocks.

In contrast, small doses of psilocybin and cannabis can help open the mind, lift the mood, clear thinking, boost creativity, and even treat certain mental health conditions. Cannabis, used responsibly and moderately, is not a poison — it can be medicinal, reducing stress and pain, and even improving quality of life.

It’s important to know your limits; doses must be small to avoid unwanted effects — psilocybin microdoses and small cannabis doses can work as smart tools to support the mind and body, not poison them.

This dude is the poster child for everything wrong with Canada’s leadership, and I’m sick of hearing his name floated around like he’s some economic messiah. The guy was the governor of the Bank of Canada, then jetted off to the Bank of England like he’s too good for us, only to come back and act like he’s gonna save Canada? Gimme a break!

Carney’s all about his fancy globalist agendas, cozying up to the UN and pushing green nonsense while Canada’s economy is choking under Trudeau’s trainwreck policies. He’s got this smug vibe, like he’s smarter than everyone else, but all I see is a guy who’d sell out Canada faster than you can say “carbon tax.” Meanwhile, I’m over here dreaming of the day Canada becomes the 51st state of the USA, where we’d finally get some real leadership. Trump would walk in, take one look at Carney’s resume, and say, “You’re fired!”—and I’d be cheering from the sidelines.

And don’t get me started on the immigration mess. The Canadian government has let in way too many immigrants, and it’s killing our country. Housing’s unaffordable, jobs are scarce, and our cities are bursting at the seams. We need Trump to come in with his no-nonsense deportation policies and clean house. Carney?

Think about it – both offer a curated, artisanal experience, but instead of caffeine, you get a range of kombuchas, kefirs, and maybe even some lighter beers or wines in some places.

The focus on health and wellness is huge right now, and fermented drinks definitely tap into that. Plus,the lower alcohol content of many fermented beverages makes for a more relaxed and longer-lasting social experience compared to straight-up bars.I can imagine meeting friends for a probiotic-rich kombucha after work, just as easily as grabbing a latte.

What do you think? Is there potential for fermentation bars to really take off as community hubs, or is the coffee shop culture too deeply ingrained? Are there already some triumphant examples of this happening where you are? I’m curious to hear everyone’s thoughts.",1,1753158051.0,CulinaryVibesOnly,0,1.0,False

Vậy ông Trùm đứng sau chuỗi cửa hàng bán chiếc bánh mì có giá “đắt xắt ra miếng” là ai?

**Phải chi trả 208.000 đồng cho chiếc bánh mì**

Sự việc bắt nguồn từ việc chị Nguyễn Ngọc Trà My (TP.HCM) đã phải chi trả 208.000 đồng cho một chiếc bánh mì kẹp thịt heo xá xíu, ít rau dưa, nặng khoảng 200gram, tại sân bay Nội Bài.

Không chỉ dừng lại ở đó, chị My còn chia sẻ về một bữa ăn khác tại sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất, nơi chị phải bỏ ra 560.000 đồng cho một bát phở và một suất cơm gà mà theo chị nhận định là ""chất lượng không tương xứng với giá tiền"".

Theo chị My, mức giá dịch vụ ăn uống tại các sân bay Việt Nam cao hơn so với những sân bay ở các quốc gia khác như Hàn Quốc, Trung Quốc, Singapore hay Indonesia – những nơi mà mức sống và thu nhập trung bình của người dân cao hơn Việt Nam.

Sau khi bài viết lan truyền trên mạng đã nhanh chóng thu hút sự quan tâm của mọi người. Nhiều người không ngần ngại kể lại những câu chuyện tương tự về việc họ phải chi trả mức giá cao cho một bát mì tôm úp có giá 50.000 đồng, một bát phở gà lên tới 138.000 đồng, thậm chí có người phải trả 930.000 đồng cho ba bát phở, hay một ly cà phê đen ""ngót nghét"" 200.000 đồng.

Những chia sẻ này không chỉ thể hiện sự bức xúc cá nhân mà còn đặt ra vấn đề lớn về tác động tiêu cực đến hình ảnh du lịch Việt Nam. Độc giả lo ngại rằng việc ""chặt chém"" giá cả tại các nhà chờ sân bay quốc tế sẽ khiến du khách có cái nhìn tiêu cực đến hình ảnh, con người Việt Nam. Đặc biệt là gây khó khăn cho chính những người dân trong nước.

**Kiên quyết xử lý vi phạm để đảm bảo quyền lợi cho khách hàng**

Sau khi tiếp nhận thông tin phản ánh, ngày 10/7, Cục Hàng không Việt Nam đã phát đi công văn khẩn, yêu cầu các đơn vị liên quan nhanh chóng xác minh, làm rõ, đồng thời kiên quyết chấn chỉnh những hành vi vi phạm (nếu có) nhằm đảm bảo quyền lợi chính đáng và chất lượng dịch vụ cho hành khách tại các cảng hàng không.

 **“Ông Trùm” đứng sau chuỗi cửa hàng bán chiếc bánh mì đó là ai?**

Theo tìm hiểu, chiếc bánh mì có giá 208.000 đồng được mua tại cửa hàng Big Bowl. Đây là chuỗi cửa hàng thuộc thương hiệu F&B chuyên phục vụ trong sân bay, nằm trong hệ sinh thái Autogill VFS F&B trong đế chế dịch vụ hàng không do IPP Group của “ông vua hàng hiệu” Johnathan Hạnh Nguyễn.

Autogrill VFS F&B được thành lập từ năm 2013 là liên doanh giữa Autogrill và Công ty Dịch vụ Thực phẩm và Đồ uống Việt Nam.

Hệ sinh thái này không chỉ có Big Bowl (phục vụ phở, bún, bánh mì), mà còn sở hữu loạt thương hiệu khác như Two Tigers, Banh Mi Kep, Saigon Café bar Kitchen, HaNoi Café bar Kitchen… ở khắp các sân bay lớn.

Với việc sở hữu độc quyền tại các vị trí đắc địa nhất tại sảnh chờ các sân bay quốc tế lớn, hệ sinh thái của ông Hạnh Nguyễn dường như không có đối thủ cạnh tranh. Trong 4 năm, từ năm 2015 -2019, doanh thu của Autogill VFS F&B tăng từ 500 tỷ đồng lên hơn 1.150 tỷ đồng, biên lãi gộp từng lên đến hơn 80%, lợi nhuận trước thuế hơn 280 tỷ đồng mỗi năm. Trung bình mỗi ngày thu về hơn 3 tỷ đồng doanh thu và gẫn 800 triệu đồng lợi nhuận.

Tuy nhiên năm 2020 – 2021 khi hoạt động hàng không bị ngừng trệ, doanh thu của doanh nghiệp lao dốc không phanh, chỉ còn 80 tỷ đồng vào năm 2021, lỗ lũy kế 137 tỷ đồng, vốn chủ sở hữu giảm còn 12 tỷ đồng. Khi du lịch quốc tế phục hồi, hoạt động kinh doanh của hệ sinh thái này cũng hồi sinh mạnh mẽ.

Năm 2022, doanh thu Autogill VFS F&B đạt gần 550 tỷ đồng, lợi nhuận sau thuế 65 tỷ đồng, vốn chủ sở hữu tăng lên 77 tỷ đồng, tổng tài sản đạt 266 tỷ đồng.

Cho đến nay, tập đoàn IPPG đã đầu tư và hợp tác đầu tư đưa về đầu tư gần 50 dự án, tạo công ăn việc làm cho 25.000 lao động tại Việt Nam, doanh số hằng năm đạt hơn 12.000 tỷ đồng. Riêng từ năm 2014 – 2024 tổng số tiền thuế Tập đoàn đã đóng lên đến 15.410 tỷ đồng.",1,1753157998.0,VietNamNation,3,1.0,False
