1kyytjg,https://youtu.be/bIFyUDJoRu4,3 Very Scary TRUE Animals Saving People in the Wild Horror Stories,"# ""The Night the Lions Came"":

I was twelve, living in a small village in Ethiopia where the days blended into each other—school, chores, and walking the dusty paths that wound through fields and toward the distant forests. The sounds of the wilderness were familiar: birds chirping, the occasional bleat of a goat, and sometimes, far off, the deep roar of a lion. Those roars always made me pause, but lions stayed away from our village, so I never worried much. That day, though, something felt off as I walked home from school. The shadows seemed longer, the air heavier, like the world was holding its breath. I shook it off, thinking it was just my imagination, but I couldn’t have been more wrong.I was halfway home, kicking pebbles along the path, when I heard footsteps behind me—quick, deliberate, not the lazy shuffle of a neighbor. My stomach twisted, but before I could turn, a rough hand clamped over my mouth, stifling my scream. Another grabbed my arms, pinning them behind me. I kicked, twisted, tried to bite, but there were four of them—men with hard faces, eyes cold as stones. “Stop fighting,” one hissed, his voice low and mean. “You’re coming with us. A man’s paid good money for you. You’re getting married.”Married? I was a child. The word hit me like a slap, and panic surged through me. I thrashed harder, but they were too strong. One tied my wrists with coarse rope that bit into my skin, while another pulled a dirty cloth over my eyes, knotting it tight. The world went dark, and all I could hear was my own ragged breathing and their low, angry voices. “Keep her quiet,” one snapped. “We don’t need anyone hearing her.”They lifted me off the ground, carrying me like a sack of grain. I tried to scream, but the hand over my mouth pressed harder, making my jaw ache. We moved for what felt like hours, the men’s footsteps crunching on the ground, their muttered arguments filling the air. “This better be worth it,” one grumbled. “The buyer’s waiting, but the police are sniffing around.” “Shut up and keep moving,” another barked. My heart sank. Police? Maybe there was hope, but it felt so far away.They finally stopped at a small hut. They shoved me inside, and the air was thick with the smell of damp earth and rotting wood. The blindfold stayed on, but I could hear insects buzzing, feel the hard dirt floor beneath me. “Stay here and keep your mouth shut,” one of them growled. “You make noise, you get the stick.” I curled into a corner, tears soaking the blindfold. My wrists burned from the rope, and my body ached from being dragged. I didn’t understand why this was happening. I just wanted to go home, to hear my mother’s voice, to feel my father’s arms around me.Days blurred together—or maybe it was just one endless nightmare. They moved me at night, always blindfolded, always with rough hands yanking me along. Each time I tried to scream or pull away, they hit me with sticks, leaving bruises on my arms, legs, and back. “You’ll learn to obey,” one said, his voice flat, like he was talking about taming an animal. “The man who bought you doesn’t want trouble.” I stopped fighting after a while, too tired, too scared. My world shrank to the pain in my body and the fear in my heart.One night, I overheard them whispering as they prepared to move me again. “The police are close,” one said, his voice tight with worry. “They’ve been asking questions in the villages.” “Then we move faster,” another replied, his tone sharp. “The buyer’s waiting in the hills. We hand her over, we get paid, we disappear.” My chest tightened. If the police were close, maybe I had a chance. But what if they didn’t find me in time? The thought made my stomach churn.They untied my feet to march me out, but my hands stayed bound. The ground was uneven, and I stumbled, scraping my knees. “Get up,” one snapped, yanking me by the arm. My blindfold slipped slightly, letting me glimpse the dark shapes of trees and the faint glow of starlight. We were deep in the wilderness now, far from my village. The air was cool, and the sounds of the night—crickets, rustling leaves—felt louder, closer.Then, a low growl rumbled through the darkness, freezing my blood. A lion. Another growl followed, then a third. Three lions, somewhere close. The men stopped dead. “Lions,” one whispered, his voice trembling. “We’re too exposed out here.” “What do we do?” another asked, panic creeping in. “We can’t fight them off.” The leader cursed under his breath. “Leave the girl. She’s not worth dying for.”They dropped the ropes, and I heard their footsteps scrambling away, fading into the night. I stood there, blindfold half-loose, hands still tied, alone in the wilderness with lions nearby. My heart pounded so hard I thought it would burst. Lions were killers—everyone in the village knew that. I’d heard stories of them dragging off goats, even attacking people. Were they coming for me now? I tried to stay still, holding my breath, but my body shook uncontrollably.Then, I felt something—something large and warm—brush against my leg. A soft, rumbling sound came from its throat, not a growl but something calmer, almost like a purr. I froze, expecting teeth, claws, pain. Instead, it lay down beside me, its heavy breathing loud in my ears. Another lion approached, its footsteps soft but deliberate, circling me slowly. A third joined, settling nearby. I could smell their musky scent, feel the weight of their presence. Why weren’t they attacking? Were they waiting, toying with me? My mind raced with images of being torn apart, but they just stayed there, like silent guards.I don’t know how long I stood there, blindfold slipping further until I could see their shapes in the dim light—massive, golden bodies, eyes glinting as they watched me. One lion’s mane was thick and dark, another had a scar across its face. They didn’t move toward me, but they didn’t leave either. Every rustle in the bushes made me jump, thinking the men were coming back or that the lions would suddenly turn. My legs ached from standing so still, but I was too scared to move. What did they want? I remembered stories of lions protecting their cubs—had they mistaken me for one? My cries had been loud; maybe they thought I was theirs.Hours passed, or maybe it just felt that way. My throat was dry, my body exhausted, but I didn’t dare sit down. The lions stayed close, their breathing a steady rhythm in the night. Then, faintly, I heard voices—human voices, calling my name. “Over here! Please!” I tried to shout, but my voice was weak, hoarse from days of crying.The lions stirred. The one with the scar lifted its head, ears twitching. I held my breath, terrified they’d charge at the voices. Instead, they rose, slow and graceful, and padded into the darkness, their forms melting into the shadows. I stood alone, trembling, as the voices grew closer.Torchlight flickered through the trees, and suddenly, hands were on me, gentle this time. Someone untied the ropes, pulled off the blindfold. The light stung my eyes, but as they adjusted, I saw my father’s face, streaked with tears. “My child,” he sobbed, wrapping me in his arms so tight I could barely breathe. “We thought we’d lost you forever.” My mother was there too, her hands shaking as she touched my face, my hair, like she couldn’t believe I was real.Police officers stood behind them, their faces grim but relieved. “We’ve been searching for days,” one said, his voice kind. “The kidnappers are gone, but we’ll find them.” I didn’t care about the men right then. I just clung to my parents, feeling their warmth, their love.As they carried me back to the village, I kept looking over my shoulder, half-expecting to see the lions watching from the darkness. They were gone, but their presence lingered in my mind. Why had they protected me? Had they heard my cries and thought I was one of their own? Or was it something else, something I’d never understand? The police said the lions had stayed with me for half a day, keeping the kidnappers at bay until help arrived. A wildlife expert later told the village the lions might have mistaken my whimpers for a cub’s mewing, but to me, it felt like more than instinct.Back home, I couldn’t stop thinking about those lions. The bruises on my body faded, but the memory of their eyes, their quiet strength, stayed with me. The wilderness was still a place of danger—snakes, hyenas, and men who did terrible things—but it was also a place of miracles. Those lions, with their scarred faces and heavy paws, had become my guardians in a way I’d never expected. And every night, as I lay in my bed, I listened for their roars in the distance, wondering if they knew they’d saved me.

  


# ""Ning Nong Knew"":

I was eight years old, perched high on the back of an elephant named Ning Nong, my legs swinging as we trudged along the sandy stretch of Laguna Beach in Phuket. The air was thick with the smell of salt, sunscreen, and the faint sweetness of mangoes from a nearby vendor. Waves rolled in gently, their rhythm mixing with the chatter of tourists, the laughter of kids building sandcastles, and the calls of men selling cold drinks. My parents were back at the hotel, probably lounging by the pool or sipping cocktails at the bar, their voices fading into the hum of the morning. I’d begged them for this elephant ride, my first ever, and I couldn’t stop grinning, feeling like I was on top of the world. Yong, the mahout, sat in front of me, his thin frame steady as he guided Ning Nong with a small wooden stick. His dark hair was slicked back, and he wore a faded blue shirt, humming a tune I didn’t recognize.“Is she always this slow?” I asked, leaning forward, my hands gripping the edges of the wobbly saddle.Yong chuckled, glancing back at me. “She’s taking her time. Ning Nong’s careful with kids. You’re light as a feather to her.”I giggled, patting her rough, gray skin. It felt like sandpaper, warm from the sun, and I marveled at how something so big could be so gentle. Her trunk swayed lazily, occasionally curling up to sniff the air. The beach was alive around us—families sprawled on colorful towels, a group of teenagers kicking a soccer ball, a woman in a bright sarong selling pineapple slices. I waved at a little boy who stared wide-eyed at Ning Nong, and he waved back, his face splitting into a grin.But then, Ning Nong stopped. Her massive body froze mid-step, and I felt a tremor run through her, like a shiver. Her ears, huge and flapping, twitched sharply, and her trunk shot up, sniffing the air with quick, jerky movements. The saddle creaked as she shifted her weight, her feet stomping lightly in the sand. My smile faded. Something felt wrong, like the air had gotten heavier.“What’s she doing?” I asked, my voice smaller than before.Yong’s humming stopped. He leaned forward, his hands tightening on the rope looped around Ning Nong’s neck. “I don’t know,” he said, his brow creasing. “She’s acting strange.”I looked around, trying to figure out what had spooked her. The beach still looked normal—people laughing, waves crashing, seagulls circling overhead. But Ning Nong let out a low, rumbling sound, almost like a growl, and my stomach twisted. I’d never heard an elephant make a noise like that. Yong tapped her with his stick, muttering something in his language, but she didn’t budge. Instead, she raised her trunk higher, her ears pinned back, and she swayed, restless.“Yong, is she okay?” I asked, my hands clutching the saddle tighter.He didn’t answer right away. He stood up in the saddle, shielding his eyes with one hand as he stared out at the sea. “Something’s not right,” he said, his voice low, almost to himself.I followed his gaze. The water looked… wrong. The waves weren’t coming in anymore. Instead, the sea was pulling back, retreating from the shore like someone had yanked it away. The wet sand glistened, exposing shells, seaweed, and small fish flopping helplessly in shallow pools. It was eerie, unnatural, like the ocean was holding its breath. People on the beach noticed too. A man in a red cap pointed, shouting, “Hey, look at that! The sea’s gone!” A few tourists wandered toward the exposed seabed, curious, picking up shells and laughing.“Is that supposed to happen?” I asked, my voice trembling now.Yong’s face tightened. “No,” he said, his eyes locked on the horizon. “That’s not good.”I squinted, trying to see what he was looking at. Far out, where the sky met the sea, a thin, dark line appeared. It was small at first, barely noticeable, but it was growing, moving closer. My heart started to race. Ning Nong trumpeted, a loud, piercing blast that made me jump. Before Yong could react, she turned sharply, away from the beach, and started moving inland, her heavy feet thudding against the sand. The saddle rocked, and I grabbed the edges, my knuckles white.“Yong, what’s she doing?” I cried, my voice high with panic.“I can’t stop her!” he shouted, yanking at the rope. “She’s never done this before!”Ning Nong was moving faster now, not quite running but faster than her usual plod. Her trunk swung wildly, and her ears flapped as she pushed through the sand, heading toward a line of palm trees at the edge of the beach. I looked back, and my breath caught. The dark line on the horizon wasn’t a line anymore—it was a wall of water, towering, gray, and frothing, racing toward the shore. It roared, a deep, guttural sound that drowned out the screams starting to rise from the beach.“Tsunami!” a woman shriek Chills ran down my spine as the word hit me. I’d heard it before, in school or on TV, but I didn’t really know what it meant—only that it was bad. People were running now, their voices sharp and frantic. A man grabbed his child’s hand, dragging her toward the road. A vendor dropped his tray of fruit, mangoes rolling across the sand. “Run! Run!” someone yelled, but the water was coming too fast.“Yong, my parents!” I screamed, tears stinging my eyes. They were back at the hotel, near the beach. Were they safe? Could they see the wave?“We can’t go back!” Yong yelled, his voice cracking. He was still pulling at Ning Nong’s rope, but she ignored him, her steps steady and determined as she climbed a gentle slope toward higher ground. “Hold on tight!”I clung to the saddle, my body bouncing with each of Ning Nong’s steps. The smell of salt was stronger now, mixed with something sharp, like mud and fear. The wave was closer, its roar so loud it felt like it was inside my head. I glanced back again, and my heart stopped. The water was hitting the beach, swallowing everything—chairs, umbrellas, people. I saw a woman in a yellow dress running, her arms flailing, but the wave caught her, pulling her under like she was nothing. A car flipped over, tumbling through the foam. My throat tightened, and I couldn’t breathe. Were my parents in that?Ning Nong crashed through the palm trees, branches snapping under her weight. The ground was steeper now, and her steps slowed, but she didn’t stop. Her trunk curled protectively near me, and I could feel her breathing, heavy and fast. Yong was muttering to her, his voice urgent, but I couldn’t make out the words. All I could hear was the water, the screams, the crunch of debris being swept away below.“Is she going to save us?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.Yong looked at me, his eyes wide with fear but steady. “She’s trying,” he said. “She knows something we don’t.”The hill grew steeper, and Ning Nong’s steps became more deliberate, her massive feet digging into the soft earth. I could feel her muscles working beneath me, powerful and sure. The roar of the wave was deafening now, and I didn’t dare look back. I didn’t want to see how close it was. Instead, I focused on Ning Nong’s swaying trunk, the rhythm of her steps, anything to keep the panic from swallowing me whole.We reached a clearing near the top of the hill, and Ning Nong finally stopped. She let out another trumpet, softer this time, and turned to face the beach. Yong slid off the saddle and helped me down, his hands shaking but gentle. My legs wobbled as I touched the ground, and I grabbed his arm to steady myself. “You okay?” he asked, his voice hoarse.I nodded, but I wasn’t okay. I looked down at the beach, and my heart sank. The water had taken everything. Hotels were half-collapsed, their windows shattered, their walls smeared with mud. Trees were uprooted, twisted like matchsticks. The sea was still moving, swirling with debris—tables, clothes, pieces of roofs. I searched for my parents, for their familiar shapes, but I couldn’t see them. “Are they gone?” I whispered, tears streaming down my face.Yong knelt beside me, his hand on my shoulder. “We’ll find them,” he said, but his voice wavered. “They’re strong. They’ll be okay.”Ning Nong stood close, her trunk brushing my arm, warm and rough. I reached out and touched her, my fingers trembling. “Thank you,” I said, my voice breaking. I didn’t know if she could understand, but it felt like she did. Her big, dark eyes looked at me, calm now, like she knew we were safe.The hours dragged on. The water below started to pull back, leaving behind a wrecked world—mud, broken buildings, and things I didn’t want to look at too closely. Yong stayed with me, sitting on the grass, his eyes scanning the chaos below. “They’ll come for us,” he said. “Rescuers will come.”I nodded, but I couldn’t stop crying. I kept picturing my parents, their faces, their voices. What if they hadn’t made it? What if the water had taken them? Ning Nong lay down nearby, her trunk curled around a patch of grass, chewing slowly. She seemed so calm, so sure, and I envied her.It was late afternoon when I heard shouts. Men in orange vests appeared, climbing the hill, calling out for survivors. Yong stood up, waving his arms. “Here! We’re here!” he shouted.I stayed where I was, too scared to move, too scared to hope. But then I heard a voice—my mom’s voice. “Amber!” she screamed, and I saw her running toward me, her hair wet and plastered to her face, her clothes torn. My dad was behind her, limping but alive. I ran to them, sobbing, and they wrapped me in their arms, holding me so tight I could barely breathe.“You’re safe,” my mom said, her voice shaking as she stroked my hair. “Oh, thank God you’re safe.”“How did you get up here?” my dad asked, his eyes red and tired.I pointed at Ning Nong, who was standing now, watching us with those steady eyes. “She knew,” I said. “She ran before the water came.”Yong nodded, patting Ning Nong’s side. “She’s special,” he said, a small smile breaking through his exhaustion. “She felt it coming.”My parents hugged Yong, thanking him over and over, but he shook his head. “Not me,” he said. “Her.”That day stays with me, sharp and heavy. The fear, the screams, the way the world turned to chaos in minutes. The sight of that wave, unstoppable, swallowing everything. The smell of salt and destruction, the sound of lives breaking apart. But above it all, I remember Ning Nong—her restless trumpets, her steady climb, the way she carried me to safety when I didn’t even know I was in danger. I still see her in my dreams, her trunk raised, her steps sure, saving me from a nightmare that was all too real.

  


# ""The Bear That Chose Me"":

I was hiking alone in the Sierra Nevada mountains, California, trying to shake off the weight of a bad week. My backpack was heavy, stuffed with a sleeping bag, two liters of water in a scratched-up bottle, a small stove, a can of beans, granola bars, and a bag of dried apricots. The trail was rugged, a narrow path winding through towering pine trees and jagged rock outcrops. The air carried the sharp scent of pine sap and dry earth, mixed with the faint musk of something wild. My boots crunched on gravel, the sound blending with distant bird calls and the whisper of wind through branches. I’d been out here for three days, camping under a sky so clear it felt like I could touch the stars. It was my escape, my way to feel free. But that morning, something felt wrong. The forest was too quiet, the shadows too sharp, like the trees were watching. I pushed the feeling down, adjusted my pack, and kept moving, my map folded in my pocket.I was deep in the backcountry, miles from the nearest road, when I saw it. A flicker of movement on a rocky ledge about twenty feet ahead. I froze, my breath catching. A mountain lion crouched there, its yellow eyes locked on me, unblinking. Its body was lean, muscles rippling under tawny fur, tail twitching like a slow metronome. My heart slammed against my ribs. I’d read about this—don’t run, don’t turn your back, make yourself big. My hands, clammy with sweat, tightened around my walking stick, a sturdy branch I’d picked up on day one. It felt flimsy now, no match for those claws.“Hey,” I said, my voice shaky, barely above a whisper. “Stay back. I’m not food.”The lion didn’t move, just stared, its growl low and guttural, vibrating in the air. I took a slow step back, my boots scraping the dirt. My eyes stayed on its face, on those sharp, gleaming teeth. I could see every detail—the way its whiskers twitched, the faint scars on its muzzle. It crouched lower, ready to spring. My stomach twisted. I was alone, no cell signal, no one to hear me scream. The nearest ranger station was a day’s hike away. I thought about climbing a tree, but mountain lions climb better than humans. Running was suicide—they’re faster, stronger. My mind raced, grasping for options, finding none.The lion leaped down from the ledge, landing silently on the trail. Dust puffed around its paws. It was closer now, maybe ten feet away, its ears flat, tail lashing. I stumbled back, my stick raised, heart pounding so hard it hurt. “Get back!” I shouted, my voice cracking. I waved the stick, trying to look bigger, but it felt useless, like waving a twig at a storm. The lion took another step, its growl deeper, more menacing. I tripped over a root, catching myself against a tree, the rough bark scraping my palm. My pack felt like a weight dragging me down, but I didn’t dare drop it. The lion’s eyes never left mine, cold and focused, like it was measuring the distance to my throat.Then came a sound that stopped my breath—a deep, earth-shaking roar, like thunder rolling through the trees. The lion froze, its ears twitching. From the dense pines to my left, a massive shape exploded onto the trail. A bear, enormous, its dark brown fur bristling, its paws the size of hubcaps. Its head was low, mouth open, showing teeth as long as my fingers. My legs turned to jelly. Two predators now, and me in the middle. The bear didn’t even glance at me. It charged the lion, roaring again, a sound that rattled my bones.The lion hissed, swiping a paw, claws flashing. The bear didn’t flinch. It slammed into the lion, a blur of fur and muscle, the impact so hard I felt the ground shake. They rolled in the dirt, snarling, clawing, a tangle of teeth and power. Dust clouded the air, stinging my eyes. I staggered back, my stick slipping from my sweaty hands. The lion yowled, a sharp, desperate sound, and broke free, scrambling up the trail. Its tail was low, ears pinned as it vanished into the trees, leaving only the echo of its retreat.The bear stood, shaking its massive head, fur rippling. Then it turned to me. My breath stopped. Its eyes were dark, deep, impossible to read. Its muzzle was wet, flecked with dirt, and its chest heaved from the fight. I pressed myself against the tree, the bark digging into my back. My hands shook so hard I could barely hold them up. “Please,” I whispered, my voice barely a breath. “Don’t come closer.”The bear took a step toward me, its paws silent on the dirt. I braced myself, expecting it to charge, to finish what the lion started. But it stopped, maybe five feet away, and just stood there, watching. Its head tilted slightly, nostrils flaring as it sniffed the air. My heart was a hammer in my chest, my mouth dry as sand. I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare blink. The forest was silent now, no birds, no wind, just the faint rustle of leaves under the bear’s weight. Its eyes held mine, steady, almost curious, like it was deciding what I was.Seconds stretched into minutes. My legs ached from standing so still, my arms numb from holding them up. The bear snorted, a low, rumbling sound that made me flinch. It shifted its weight, claws scraping the ground, and I thought it was over. But instead of lunging, it sat back on its haunches, its massive bulk settling like a boulder. It didn’t growl, didn’t bare its teeth. It just watched, its breath slow and heavy, steam rising from its nose in the cool air.I didn’t know what to do. My mind screamed to run, but my body wouldn’t move. “What do you want?” I whispered, more to myself than the bear. It didn’t react, just kept staring, its eyes glinting in the dim light filtering through the pines. The forest started to come alive again—crickets chirping, a distant owl hooting, the soft creak of branches. I glanced at the trail, wondering if I could slip away, but the bear’s presence pinned me in place. It wasn’t threatening, not exactly, but it wasn’t leaving either.Time dragged. My arms dropped, too tired to stay raised. The bear didn’t move. My pack felt heavier, the straps cutting into my shoulders. I thought about my life—my job, my apartment, the fight with my brother that sent me out here to escape. None of it mattered now. All that existed was this bear, this moment, and the question of whether I’d walk away.Then I heard it—voices, faint but human, coming from down the trail. The bear’s ears twitched, its head turning slightly. I held my breath. Headlights flickered through the trees, faint at first, then stronger. The bear stood, its movements slow, deliberate. It gave me one last look, those dark eyes unreadable, then turned and lumbered into the forest. Its massive form melted into the shadows, silent as a ghost, leaving only the faint snap of a twig.“Hey! Anyone out there?” a man’s voice called, closer now. Flashlights swept the trail, and I saw two figures—rangers, their green uniforms catching the light.“Here!” I shouted, my voice hoarse, cracking. I stumbled forward, my legs weak, my pack dragging. They ran toward me, one with a radio crackling, the other carrying a rifle.“You okay?” the older one asked, his gray beard catching the light. His eyes scanned me, then the trail. “What happened? You’re white as a sheet.”I collapsed onto a rock, my breath coming in gasps. “Mountain lion,” I said. “It was… it was going to attack. Then a bear came. It chased the lion off.”The younger ranger, a woman with a tight ponytail, raised an eyebrow. “A bear? You sure?”I nodded, my hands still shaking as I pointed to the scuffed dirt, the claw marks in the dust. “It fought the lion. Then it just… stood there, watching me, until you showed up.”The older ranger knelt, inspecting the ground. “Tracks,” he said, tracing a massive paw print with his finger. “Big ones. Grizzly, maybe. And these—mountain lion, no doubt.” He stood, shaking his head. “You’re damn lucky. Lions don’t back off easy, and bears don’t usually play hero.”“Lucky,” I repeated, the word hollow. I didn’t feel lucky. I felt like I’d been spared by something I couldn’t understand, something wild and ancient.“Stay here,” the woman said, handing me a water bottle. “We’ll radio for a truck. You need to get out of here.”I nodded, gulping the water, my throat burning. “Do bears… do they do that? Save people?”The older ranger shrugged, slinging his rifle over his shoulder. “Bears do what they want. Could’ve been protecting its territory, didn’t like the lion sniffing around. Or maybe it just didn’t see you as a threat. Either way, you’re here, so don’t question it.”They led me to their jeep, parked a half-mile down the trail. The ride to the ranger station was bumpy, the headlights cutting through the dark. I kept looking out the window, half-expecting to see those yellow eyes or the bear’s hulking shape in the trees. At the station, they gave me coffee and a blanket, and I told the story again, every detail—the lion’s growl, the bear’s roar, the way the forest held its breath. The rangers listened, scribbling notes, their faces a mix of disbelief and awe.“We’ll send a team to check the area,” the older ranger said. “If that lion’s still around, we need to know. And that bear… well, it’s got a story now.”I stayed at the station until dawn, too wired to sleep. When a truck took me to town, I kept replaying the moment—the lion’s stare, the bear’s sudden charge, those long minutes when it just watched me. I haven’t gone back to those mountains. I don’t know if I ever will. But sometimes, at night, I hear that roar in my dreams, and I wonder what made that bear choose me.",1,1748592865.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I’m a 41-year-old entrepreneur based in the vibrant heart of Bangalore, and I’m here to offer a unique, mutually rewarding connection to a bright, ambitious, and beautiful young woman who’s looking for something extraordinary.
A bit about me: I’ve built a successful career in tech and real estate, which has afforded me a life of comfort and adventure. Picture a guy who owns a sleek penthouse in Indiranagar with a view of the city skyline, drives a Mercedes G-Wagon for weekend getaways to Coorg, and has a private wine cellar stocked with vintages from Tuscany to Napa Valley. I’m 6’1”, keep myself fit with morning runs in Cubbon Park, and have a knack for making people laugh with my dry wit. Whether it’s dining at Bangalore’s finest restaurants like The Fatty Bao or jetting off for a spontaneous trip to the Maldives, I live life with passion and generosity.
What makes me different? I’m not just about the glitz. I’m a man who values deep conversations—whether it’s debating philosophy over coffee at Koshy’s or planning a stargazing night at Nandi Hills. I’m a foodie who loves cooking Italian dishes from scratch (my truffle risotto is a crowd-pleaser), and I’m always up for exploring Bangalore’s hidden gems, from quirky art galleries to secret rooftop bars. I also mentor startups in my free time, so I’m all about supporting dreams and ambitions.
What I’m looking for: A confident, intelligent woman (18-30) who’s got her own spark—maybe you’re a student, an artist, or a dreamer with big goals.

We are both in college studying different degrees. It's currently exam-season for us, and we both were under a lot of stress. He was busy working on a project that was due in 3 days. I was studying for one of my final exams. So, we clocked out at around 8pm and went to bed, when we started watching instagram reels on his phone. He sent a funny reel to his sister, when I saw his ex on his most frequently contacted. She was like number 8. His sister was way below. And, to my knowledge, he sends his sister reels often.

Now, I don't have a problem with an amicable breakup. I also don't have a problem with being friendly with your ex. I'd be lying if I said I was *comfortable* with my bf talking to his ex, but I could have gotten over it.

The things is, after I saw her on his most frequently contacted, I just turned around and went to bed - importantly, forgetting to switch off my 6:30 alarm for the morning. The next morning, it went off for like 2-3 seconds, I quickly switched it off and prayed he didn't wake up, but he did. He was super pissed. Now, I know I fucked up by not apologising, but I had hoped it would be that big of a deal, considering we went to bed at like 10pm or so. He then proceeded not to talk to me for the entire day. I was a bit confused as-to why he would be mad at an alarm, so I thought he must be mad at something else.

That evening, I asked him if I did something wrong and he then said how I don't respect him because I left my didn't put off my alarm the previous night even though he had a big day today. I responded by apologising profusely, and then explaining what had happened. Not as an excuse (and I feel I made that very clear based on previous apologies I have given) but as a sequence of events that when I tell him ""I forgot"" he wouldn't see it as some lame attempt at shoving it under the rug.

But he then proceeded to COMPLETELY IGNORE my apology, and immediately start defending him talking to his ex.

I could have ignored it, but after he defended it, I felt like he was hiding something. So I confronted him about it 2 days later (since we didn't really speak since) and asked him to see his phone. In the 1,5 years we have been dating I have never just went through his phone. So he took this as me accusing him of cheating after giving me the phone. (A lot of reels were exchanged between the him and the ex. All platonic, but on a regular basis).

Now, did I overreact? Was I being unreasonable in making the assumption?

Note: he has memorabilia of her, had coffee with her a couple months ago that he never told me about, I had to find out through a 3rd source, and I have on multiple occasions told him how he is breaking my trust regarding other things, but not her",1,1748592781.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

Since I don’t have a French bank account yet ( this is a whole other ordeal 🙈) I’m looking for someone local who’d be willing to write the check, I’m happy to reimburse you immediately in cash or via instant transfer (Wise, PayPal, etc.), and would love to treat you to coffee or lunch to thank you!

I know this might sound sketchy, but I promise this is a genuine request. I don’t have any friends in the area yet and no one at the vet had a checkbook, so it’s been really difficult to find a solution. 

If you know of a local service that handles this, or if you’re in the Aix/Provence area and open to helping, I can absolutely come to you.

Thanks in advance for any ideas or support!

P.S here is our dog Nelly who the passport is for. She is loving France :)

* Opening on establishing shots of the farming community with Johnny Cash playing to establish the small-town, slow-life setting.
* Sheriff Dutten in his car with his badge and wedding ring in focus to establish his priorities as a hard-working family man.
* His wife, Doctor Dutten, portrayed as equally hard-working but with an easy-going and likeable side as she lets her secretary, Becca, leave work to go to her boyfriend's baseball game (Scotty).
* The principal stating that the sheriff doesn't have to pay for his coffee, but the sheriff comically replying that the principal still has to pay for his parking tickets - they have a playful rapport because everybody knows everybody in town, while the sheriff continues to be portrayed with integrity and as obeying the letter of the law; he won't be bought, no matter how small the matter.
* Scotty is established as the town's star pitcher, referring back to Becca's conversation with Dr Dutten.
* Rory arrives on the pitch in a confused state, firearm in hand. The sheriff gives him the benefit of the doubt ('you're drunk, that's all'), quickly establishing that he has known the man for a long time and is willing to talk things down calmly.
* The sheriff's quickfire draw demonstrates his ability to act, while his immediate reaction to having shot Rory shows that he has still taken the matter on a deeply personal level.
* Finally, the zoom-out to the satellite POV and the jets with their trails flying overhead, establishing that the town is already being watched.

There isn't a single ounce of fat on the first 5 minutes of the movie, and it establishes more about setting, character and tone than most movies manage in their entire first acts. Just excellent writing.",4,1748592350.0,horror,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 1 Mind-link**

Morgan, the Alpha's Daughter. Book 1

Morgan



I wake up with a smile on my face—yesterday was the best day ever. Last night, I had my Sweet Sixteen party, and Mom had organized it to perfection. I’m not a girly girl, so pink was out of the question. Instead, Mom used a few of my favorite colors: indigo and maroon.



From the tablecloth to the decorations, everything was in indigo and maroon. Only our Pack-members were invited, just like every other year. That’s how it has always been for any party we have—whether it’s for me, the Pack, or one of my six older Brothers. Mom and Dad never invite members of other Packs. It’s an unspoken rule in our pack, one that has been in place for centuries, and I doubt it will change anytime soon.



The best part of my Sweet Sixteen was the gift from my family—a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy, custom-ordered in my favorite colors: black, indigo, and maroon. Even the outfit, helmet, and boots matched—black with indigo and maroon accents.



The jacket fits me like a glove, and the same goes for the pants, both made of a sturdy material—no doubt at Mom’s insistence. My helmet is my favorite next to the bike because Declan made sure our Pack’s crest was airbrushed onto it, using indigo and maroon. A Wolf lying near a water shore.



The boots have a two-inch heel with every possible protection feature, and again, I know Mom was behind it. But I don’t mind at all. Dad made me promise not to ride my bike until Ashton taught me how to ride safely. I had to keep a straight face when I made that promise. If only he knew I’d been riding Ashton’s bike for six months already.



My name is Morgan, and I am the youngest Pup of Alpha Tate and Luna Giselle. Like I mentioned before, I have six older Brothers. Don’t ask me how our parents managed it, but there are exactly two years and one month between each of us. To make it even creepier, we were all born on the first of the month.



We all spent our first year in the same room since Mom wanted the nursery close to their bedroom. But on our first birthday, we each got our own room. Everything was prepared weeks before my Brothers were born—Dad made sure of that.



The day before I was born, Ashton asked Mom why he didn’t have a baby Sister. Mom told him, “We don’t always get what we want.” He then asked her if she wanted a baby girl. She said, “If I get a baby girl tomorrow, I’ll be over the moon.”



Ashton and Dad had laughed their asses off, knowing for a fact that Mom wasn’t pregnant. Mom and Dad had been trying for another Pup ever since Landon was born, and Mom had been devastated when she found out she wasn’t pregnant a few months before that day. After that, she didn’t want to try again.



The next day, just after breakfast, Mom collapsed. Dad rushed her to the infirmary, my Brothers running behind him. From time to time, Dad felt the excruciating pain Mom was going through, and it took hours before our Pack-doctor finally came out to see him.



You can imagine the look on Dad’s face when Doc told him he had a baby girl. Mom panicked because nothing had been prepared for me, but she didn’t have to worry. Everyone in our Pack helped our Beta and Gamma females get everything ready. To this day, Mom still calls me her little miracle.



With Ashton being born in January, you can do the math—I'm a summer Pup, born in July.



So, I am the youngest of seven Pups and the only female, but my Brothers never treated me any differently. I might be Daddy’s little Princess, but I’m not a spoiled brat. Mom and Dad provide us with everything we need, but if we want anything extra, we have to work for it—something we’ve always accepted without argument.



I get out of bed and take a shower. As I wash my hair, I think about what to do today. Dad gave me the day off, figuring I’d sleep in after my party. And while I did wake up later than usual, it’s still early. First thing on my list—breakfast. My stomach rumbles in agreement.



I grab my training outfit from my closet, even though I don’t have training today. I’ll go through my routine on my own, since our Gamma probably isn’t expecting me. As I step out of my room, I realize something—it’s too quiet.



This is usually the time of day when everyone is rushing around. Dad hurrying out the door for his morning meeting, Ashton trailing behind him, and Mom calling after them to be on time for lunch. My other Brothers scrambling to make it to training, with Mom yelling for them to be back on time for lunch. The only one who never rushes anywhere is me.



But today, it’s eerily silent. Even our Omega isn’t in the kitchen. I am glad I can make my own breakfast.



I sit at the kitchen island with my meal and coffee, still wondering why no one is around. After finishing my coffee, I rinse my dishes and place them in the dishwasher before heading downstairs to the training grounds.



Every Pack-member I pass looks a little confused. I have to stifle a smile—looks like everyone thought I’d be sleeping in today.



As I walk down the last flight of stairs, I see that Dad’s office door is closed. He’s probably in his usual morning meeting with his Beta and Gamma. It’s one of the few times during the day when his door is shut. I walk towards the back of the Pack-house—the fastest way to get to the training grounds.



Again, I’m met with confused looks. And now, it’s starting to annoy me. Why is it so strange to see me up and about? Other than my party last night, nothing unusual happened and that means I wake up at a decent hour.



I shrug it off and get to training. The only difference today—our Gamma is a no-show. It doesn’t bother me. By the time I’m done, I’ve worked up a sweat. Grabbing my now-empty water bottle, I head back to the Pack-house. This time, I’m greeted with smiles and “Good morning”s from those I pass.



The door to Dad’s office is closed, and this time I wonder what is going on. Normally, the door would be open by now. As I pass the Beta floor, I hear a lot of commotion, but I ignore it because I am in desperate need of a shower and want to be downstairs in time for lunch.



After my shower, I blow-dry my hair before braiding it. I decide to put on my light blue, high-waisted skinny jeans with an off-the-shoulder black shirt. I grab my boots to go with my outfit and apply a little mascara before heading out of my room. Again, I am met with silence.



I decide to check the kitchen, and when I walk in, I smell that no one has been here since I left. This really worries me because Mom usually comes up here to change before lunch. I walk back toward the bedrooms and I can smell that no one has been here either in the past few hours, which is odd because my Brothers always take a shower after training.



Right now, I wish Dad had initiated me into the Pack yesterday, but I understand why he didn’t—he didn’t want me to have a splitting headache during my party. Still, it would make things easier if I could link Mom or Dad. I’ll find out what’s going on at lunch, and I feel a little better knowing I’ll see my family in a few minutes.



I decide to check my agenda on my way down to the main dining room to see when I have my Mother-Daughter day with Mom, and I nearly lose my footing when I don’t see it scheduled for this week. I go through the agenda for the next three months, but I don’t see any Mother-Daughter days planned.



This is so unlike Mom. She loves our Mother-Daughter days and always plans them ahead. It’s her way of spending time with me, and even though I was reluctant at first, I now look forward to them just as much as she does.



I hear chatter coming from the dining room and slip my phone into my back pocket as I enter the room.



Every conversation halts for a second, but soon the room is filled with chatter again. When I turn toward our table, I notice my family isn’t there yet. I walk over to the buffet, place my favorite foods onto my plate, and grab a cappuccino before heading to my seat.



I smile when I hear Mom’s voice getting closer, but the moment she walks into the dining room, she switches to the mind-link as she looks at our Beta female. It doesn’t take long before I realize that all of them are talking through the mind-link.



**Chapter 2 Sleepless Nights**



**Morgan**



It has been three months since my Sweet Sixteen, and I’m not sure if I should scream or cry. Every morning, I wake up on an empty Alpha floor. My entire family is already out the door by the time I wake up, and no matter what I try, they either ignore me or tell me they’re too busy.



For as long as I can remember, I was always with one of my Brothers when I wasn’t in school, helping in any way I could and learning a lot over the years. During my first year in school, I learned quickly that girls only wanted to be my friend in hopes of meeting one of my Brothers. They’d find no excuse to leave if none were around.



Some people didn’t want to be my friends because of who I was but because of who I knew. Because of my lack of real friends, I would help my Brothers however I could—filing papers or getting coffee as a young Pup, and when I got older, I would help them with more important things. Dad let me sit at a small desk of my own in his office as long as I was quiet. I’d just sit there reading, writing, or drawing.



Mom always said that by watching my Father and Brothers work, I’d understand the kind of work my Mate would have to do on a daily basis. She said that’s something most Lunas don’t understand anymore—they’re too busy with their parties and dinners.



By spending so much time in Dad’s office or my Brothers’ offices, I know every nook and cranny of our Pack-house. I know every position of our Warriors that are not running patrol and I know every route our patrols run. They never run the same route twice in a row, and our hidden Warriors serve as extra security.



I know which Packs we have an alliance with, which ones are friendly, and which ones we need to avoid. I also know who the Wolves and Lycans are in each Pack's leadership and who is set to take over in the future.



I know more about our Pack than all my Brothers combined. Sometimes, I’d hear Dad talk about other Alphas spoiling their Pups rotten, giving them everything they asked for. Dad wasn’t like that—he made us earn our “extras,” as he called them, which were usually things we didn’t really need.



I earned them by spending time in the kitchen, helping prepare meals throughout the day. I love being able to cook or bake. At first, I would measure the ingredients for the Omegas. When I got older, I helped cut fruits and vegetables. Over the past few years, I’ve been helping with the cooking and baking for our Pack-members, and Mom is really proud of what I’ve accomplished so far.



Spending so much time with Dad and my Brothers made Mom decide that we’d have a Mother-Daughter day once a week. It could be a day at the spa, a shopping spree, or just sitting in the garden talking about significant events in my future.



I’d rather spend my days on the training grounds with my Brothers and the Warriors than with Mom and the other Lunas talking about whatever it is they talk about. As I’ve already mentioned, I’m not a girly girl, and this was her way of bonding with me. I think she secretly wrote down everything I told her so she’d know how to organize every event to my liking. I really enjoyed my days with Mom—so long as it was just the two of us. If other females joined us, the conversation would always end up as a discussion about parties and their do’s and don’ts.



But we haven’t had a Mother-Daughter Day in the past three months. After about two weeks, I tried to bring it up with her during lunch, but she brushed me off, saying she was too busy. She’s always off somewhere with our Beta and Gamma females. She even stops talking when I walk into the room.



I tried to talk to my Brothers and Dad during those first two weeks, but I got the same response from them. Dad barely says a word to me— even a simple “Good morning” or “Hello” seems too much. All I get from my Brothers are “Not now,” “I’m busy,” “Don’t have time,” and other remarks like that. Even my training has stopped since our Gamma never shows up anymore.



Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are spent in silence, even though I know they talk to each other through the mind-link. I can’t use it since Dad still hasn’t initiated me into the Pack and every time I try to bring it up, he cuts me off. Every Pup gets initiated into the Pack on their sixteenth birthday, but for some reason, Dad forgot to hold the ceremony after my Sweet Sixteen party.



After a month, I stopped going to the dining room for meals, but I doubt anyone has noticed. 



About a month ago, I was wandering around the territory, just contemplating what to do with my life, when I found a small cottage near our northern border.



If I’m not on the training grounds, I’m at the cottage, trying to find a new purpose in life—and I think I’ve seen it. I will sign up for the King’s Army, but I am not sure yet what kind of position I would like to get. 



Over the past month, I’ve moved quite a few things to the cottage, and I spend my days there taking tests.



I hope those tests will help me determine what I’m good at and which positions in the King’s Army best suit me. 



Today, I’ll head to our Archive before going to my sanctuary. I’ll take my file out of the Archive and update it myself.



I doubt anyone has looked at it in the past three months, or someone would have noticed that I wasn’t initiated into the Pack. 



As every morning, I make my own breakfast. Once I’m done, I erase every trace of having been there. I place a few items from the pantry into my backpack before heading out the door.



Walking down the stairs, I notice that even the Pack-members are too busy to greet me. No one stops me when I enter the Archive. It only takes me a few minutes to find my file. As I expected, the last entry is from my sixteenth birthday, written by Dad. It just states that I turned sixteen that day.



I slip the file into my backpack and head out the back door toward my cottage. I don’t run into anyone on the way, and a week ago, it would have made me sad—but not anymore. I’m going to live my life the way I want and stop hoping my family will finally notice me. Those days are behind me.



I’ve cried enough tears and had enough sleepless nights. I’ll focus on my future—a future away from this Pack and my family. 



**Chapter 3 New Life**



**Ashton**



During Morgan’s Sweet Sixteen party, Dad told us we had an early morning meeting in his office the next day—there was something significant he and Mom needed to discuss with us. He mentioned that he had given Morgan the day off so she could sleep in, which would give them time to tell us what they needed to say.



I had checked on her before we all went down to Dad’s office and was surprised to see our Beta and Gamma couple present as well.



“What I’m about to tell you never leaves this room. If this gets out, it will cause many problems, and we will get attacked for it,” Dad stated, and I knew he wasn’t kidding.



“Most Pups born into our bloodline are males, and once I’ve told you everything, you’ll understand why most will think that’s a good thing. A hundred and fifteen years ago, the last female was born into our bloodline, and despite all the precautions her family took, it ended badly for her.



Like every other female in my bloodline, she received her gift on her seventeenth birthday at the exact time she was born, and a year later, she found her fated Mate. Her Father asked him to stay with them for a week, and they got to know her Mate during that week. He was a well-respected Alpha of a large Pack.



They felt they could trust him with their Daughter and her secret. They told him about her ability, and he promised them he would protect her with his life. Everything was fine for a few years, but as time passed, he realized what she could do for him and started forcing her to use her ability. The punishment for disobeying him worsened over time, and in the end, she saw no other way out.



When she found out she was pregnant with a female Pup, she took her own life. I know that his Pack is still waiting for the day another female Pup is born.”



Dad’s words left us in stunned silence. Fletcher was the first to break it.



“Is that why you called her Morgan?”



We had always wondered why she had a male’s name, but with this information, it made sense. Mom nodded in response to Fletcher’s question.



Dad had called the meeting because he wanted our help to prevent the same thing from happening to Morgan. After that, we met every morning to discuss the best course of action.



Yesterday, Hudson asked Mom the question that’s been occupying all our minds—what kind of ability Morgan will have. On her seventeenth birthday at three minutes past eleven in the evening, she will receive her gift from the Goddess.



No one knows what kind of gift it will be since it’s different for every female. Mom had researched the Pack’s Archive and discovered that seven females had been born into Dad’s bloodline. Two of them could hear thoughts, two could sense Werewolves and Lycans from a mile away, one could listen to sounds from a mile away, and one could read the memories of places as long as they had happened within twenty-four hours.",1,1748592161.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
After sending the message, my fingers shook so badly I almost dropped the phone. Inside the room, their conversation kept going.  
  
“Is this fair to Briar?” Gladys’s voice trembled, laced with a rare hint of guilt. “If it weren’t for the unborn baby, she might’ve ended it all. Watching her so lost, barely eating and living—it’s heartbreaking.”  
  
Elliot signed, as though the weight of his lies was finally pressing down.  
  
“But Carmilla’s only got six months left,” he said, voice tight. “It’s her last wish, Mom. I can’t just walk away.”  
  
“And Briar?” Gladys pushed. “She’s carrying your child.”  
  
“I’ll make it up to her in the future.” he said. “ Don’t worry,mom.”  
  
My heart felt like it was being crushed, the pain instantly radiating through my entire body until I could barely breathe.  
  
I stumbled back to my bedroom, knees buckling beneath me as I crumpled onto the floor.  
  
My phone vibrated. Conor.  
  
“What’s going on, Briar? Is everything okay? Elliot’s… he’s dead, right?”  
  
I opened my mouth to speak, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, tears poured down, hot and blinding. The world knew Elliot Sterling was dead.  
  
But I knew better.  
  
I understood Conor's confusion. Even I couldn't have imagined Elliot would fake his death, let alone that he'd do it for another bitch.  
  
Though I said nothing, my brother seemed to sense my emotional state. After a long pause, he spoke softly.  
  
""The day after tomorrow evening. I'll send a plane to pick you up then.I’ll take care of everything else.""  
  
After hanging up, I remained frozen in position, still holding the phone.  
  
Just then, a gentle knock came at the door. Standing outside was Elliot's ""older brother""  
  
Or rather, Elliot Sterling himself—holding a glass of warm milk.  
  
""Hey, Briar, what’s going on? Why are you sitting on the floor like that? Have you been crying? You... you must be missing Elliot, huh?""  
  
During the weeks since Elliot had returned as his supposed brother, he'd been incredibly kind to me, seemingly treating me as his deceased brother's widow.  
  
Countless times when facing his concern, I'd felt lost my mind.Gladys always attributed this o grief over losing Elliot.  
  
I discreetly locked my phone screen and forced a smile.  
  
""It's nothing.The baby kicked me and I lost my balance for a moment.""  
  
Elliot visibly relaxed, setting down the milk before carefully helping me up from the floor.  
  
""That little troublemaker.Wait until he's born—his uncle will teach him.""  
  
""Come [on.Here](http://on.Here) some milk for you. Drink it and take a break. Elliot wouldn't hope for this situation.""  
  
Hearing him mention his own name, I finally couldn't hold back anymore. I looked directly into his eyes and deliberately asked  
  
""Tell me the truth. Are you Elliot Sterling""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Elliot froze for a moment, then laughed softly as he gently brushed my hair.  
  
“Briar, you’re exhausted,” he said, his tone dripping with fake concern. “Why would you think I’m Elliot? That’s crazy.”  
  
""Tomorrow’s your prenatal checkup. I’ll take you. You need rest.That's my brother's only bloodline in the world. I'm going to make damn sure that baby arrives safely.""  
  
I lowered my eyes, unable to stomach the fake concern in his gaze.  
  
""Just go. I’m exhausted.""  
  
Only after the door clicked shut did the tears I'd been holding back all evening finally come flooding out.  
  
Elliot and I met at a college party.He fell for me at the freshman party.and pursued me.  
  
Two years after graduation, he gave me the most extravagant proposal.  
  
I still remember that night—the fireworks reflected in his eyes,but his eyes even more brighter than the fireworks.  
  
While planning our wedding, I discovered I was pregnant. Elliot had been overjoyed.  
  
“Perfect timing,” he whispered, pressing his forehead to mine. “Our baby came for celebrating our wedding. Briar, dear,I'm the happiest man alive right now.”  
  
I still can't wrap my head around it. Six years together, and he throws it all away,faking his own death just to bail on our wedding.  
  
Early the next morning, Elliot knocked on my door.  
  
“Briar?Time for your prenatal checkup. You ready?”  
  
But just as we were about to leave, Carmilla's voice called from behind us.  
  
“Elliot, baby, I’m not feeling well.Could you stay with me today?”  
  
At the sound of her voice, Elliot didn't even glance my way before rushing to her side.  
  
“What’s wrong, sweetheart? You should be resting.”  
  
Then he turned to me with a quick glance.  
  
“Sorry, Briar,my wife’s not feeling well. James will drive you to the hospital.”  
  
“James is outside, he’ll take you. I already called to Dr. Wilson. He's waitting for you. Just go straight over there.”  
  
I closed my eyes, trying to hold back the tears threatening to spill.  
  
When I opened them again, I didn't miss the fleeting look of satisfaction on Carmilla's face.  
  
Without a word, I nodded and walked out, closing the door behind me with a dull [thud.My](http://thud.My) hand unconsciously stroked my belly as heavy tears finally fell.  
  
James got me to the hospital on time, and I completed all the scheduled tests.  
  
Elliot had previously instructed both the driver and doctor—if I didn't show up, he would become suspicious.  
  
I sat in the hospital waiting area, staring at the blurry ultrasound picture. Just a tiny blob on the grainy black-and-white image.  
  
The doctor had pointed at it, smiling ""See that? That's your little one.""  
  
But I couldn't bear my kid has a father who kept a side piece!  
  
I wiped my face with my sleeve and made a quick call to schedule an appointment at another hospital.  
  
This was the Sterling family's private hospital—if I had the procedure here, Elliot would definitely find out.  
  
I texted James: 'Just going to grab some coffee and take a walk. You can go ahead and leave.'  
  
Waiting until his black sedan pulled away,I hurried to the curb and went to another hospital.  
  
My phone buzzed just as I was signing the consent form for the abortion. A video message from an unknown number.  
  
The video was thirty minutes. In this video, Elliot did no-holds-barred sex which I'd never seen Elliot out of control like this.  
  
For six years, he had been Mr. Considerate in bed, and he worried that I would get hurt if he was too rough.  
  
Turns out he wasn't naturally restrained in bed. Who can meet his appetite is someone else.  
  
I forced myself watch the video, torturing myself with every second of seeing a side of Elliot I never knew.  
  
I don't know how long I sat there before a nurse approached me.  
  
""Ms. Briar? Are you alright? It's time for your procedure.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I couldn't stop crying as I watched the video, even my hand holding the phone couldn't stop shaking.  
  
The worst part? I still loved that bastard. Even after everything.  
  
I couldn't just delete him like a bad Instagram post.Six years. Six goddamn years. Loving Elliot was like breathing—it just came naturally, even now.  
  
Everyone always said Elliot was obsessed with me, but they never saw how I'd saved every movie ticket stub from our dates or how I'd memorized his coffee order by our third date.  
  
Six years together....and only now.  
  
Remembering the rapid little heartbeat I'd heard during the check, I wiped away my tears and took a deep breath.Give the last chance for my baby and Elliot.  
  
Then I called him.  
  
""Elliot, can you come to the hospital? I… we need to talk.""  
  
His voice came through weirdly breathless. ""I'm kind of in the middle of something. Just Uber home and we'll talk there, okay?""  
  
""Oh god, Elliot, harder…"",with a soft moan the call disconnected, leaving just the dial tone.  
  
I'm not a kid, I knew exactly what he was doing.  
  
I looked up at the nurse hovering nearby.  
  
""Well,let’s do it.""  
  
It was after dark when I got home. The second I stepped through the door,Elliot came striding toward me.  
  
""James said you went around. What'd you buy?""  
  
Then he clocked my puffy eyes.  
  
""What’s wrong? Briar.Did you cry?what happened? About Elliot?Oh,The baby you're carrying belongs to Elliot,at least a comfort ""  
  
""What was this thing you wanted to talk about me?""  
  
I stared at his face—that perfect jawline, those eyes that still made my crazy.  
  
The same eyes I'd just watched in vedio from Carmilla.  
  
""Never mind,” I said, forcing a weak smile. “Just checking if you needed anything.""  
  
He practically deflated with relief.  
  
""You should get some rest,” he said, “You look… rough.""  
  
I just nodded and bolted for my bedroom.  
  
I fell asleep almost instantly, my dreams taking me back to college—freshman Elliot with his floppy hair and that vintage Nirvana t-shirt.  
  
""Briar Collins, I've had a crush on you since day one. Will you date with me?""  
  
""Don’t worry, I’ll treat you right.""  
  
Maybe it was the golden sunset making everything magical, or maybe it was the sincerity in his eyes that I couldn't resist.  
  
Somehow, I ended up saying yes.  
  
I woke up to sunlight streaming through the blinds. First decent night's sleep I'd had since learning of his ""death.""  
  
I was still sitting dazed in bed when my door was opened and Carmilla came in.  
  
""Wanna know why I sent that video? Still think Elliot’s some doting brother and I’m just your sister-in-law?""

Chapter 1  
  
My husband, Eric, was on a business trip abroad when he got caught in a terrorist attack.  
  
Everyone started calling me.  
  
The embassy reached out, asking me to come in for discussions.  
  
Even Eric’s family and colleagues bombarded me with calls, inquiring about the situation—some even offered to help bring him back, free of charge.  
  
I had just come out of the delivery room, yet I calmly hung up on call after call.  
  
After all, when Eric saw the news of his ex-girlfriend, Aria, a war correspondent, caught in the crossfire of a terror attack, he left me—his pregnant wife—to fly over and make sure she was safe.  
  
Back then, I was leaking amniotic fluid, clutching my swollen belly, and I asked him:  
  
“Are you really going to abandon your wife and unborn daughter to go into a war zone? Eric, if you go, I will not be responsible for the consequences.”  
  
Eric had taken all our bank books and passports and shouted at me, “You and the baby aren’t going to die anytime soon—she, on the other hand, could be dead the next second!”  
  
“You’re just giving birth. Haven’t you always been strong?” With that, he slammed the door and left.  
  
So, if he’s the one throwing his life away, why should I save him?  
  
——————  
  
Eric loved watching international news. I never understood why—until two days ago when a news report aired.  
  
A female war correspondent had been captured by terrorists during an interview.  
  
The footage lasted only a second, but I recognized her immediately—Aria, the most famous anchor on the international channel.  
  
At that moment, I was nine months pregnant, about to go into labor. Sitting in a rocking chair in the living room, I rested my hand on my belly and felt a pang of sympathy for the journalist.  
  
The next second, Eric knocked over the fruit bowl in a panic.  
  
He stood up so quickly that his knee slammed into the corner of the coffee table.  
  
The impact looked so painful that even I winced, but Eric didn’t seem to feel a thing.  
  
He staggered into the kitchen for a glass of water but accidentally hit the hot water button, scalding himself so badly he dropped the glass, shattering it.  
  
Ignoring his reddened, burned skin, he rushed into the bedroom and slammed the door shut behind him.  
  
An hour later, Eric finally emerged.  
  
“I… I have to go on a business trip.”  
  
I slowly stood up, hand still resting on my belly.  
  
“Eric, my due date is in the next couple of days. I could go into labor at any time. It’s not a good time for a trip. What if the contractions start suddenly?”  
  
“You know my mother died in childbirth with my younger brother. I’m genuinely terrified of giving birth.”  
  
“Didn’t you say the thing you were most looking forward to was being the first person our daughter saw when she opened her eyes?”  
  
Eric’s face paled, but after a moment, he said, “This trip is really important to me—I have to go. But don’t worry, I’ll definitely be back before you give birth.”  
  
I gave him a broken smile.  
  
Even though the pain in my belly was already sharp and spasmodic, and fluid was trickling down my legs like a faucet had been turned on.  
  
“I’ll agree. But Eric, I want you to know—whatever consequences come from this trip, you’ll face them alone. I won’t bear any of it for you.”  
  
Maybe my expression was too solemn, because Eric’s body trembled slightly.  
  
Then, as if swearing an oath, he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll come back safely.”  
  
With that, he rushed into the room, hastily packed a few items of clothing, and shoved on his shoes, ready to leave.  
  
Just as he was about to walk out the door, I couldn’t stop myself. I softened and called out to him.  
  
“Eric, wait a second.”  
  
He turned back, visibly irritated.  
  
“Didn’t you already say I could go? Why are you calling me back now?”  
  
Clutching my hand tightly into a fist, the pain in my belly intensifying, I remained calm.  
  
“You forgot your passport.”  
  
I dragged my body, still leaking amniotic fluid, back into the bedroom.  
  
I brought him his passport, and then handed him a bank card.  
  
That card held every paycheck Eric had transferred to me over the seven years of our marriage.  
  
His hand trembled slightly as he took the passport and the card, and even his eyes began to redden.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
For a moment, I thought he might stay.  
  
But instead, he stuffed the card and passport into his bag and swore again:  
  
“I promise I’ll be back before the baby comes.”  
  
Then he slammed the door and left in a rush.  
  
I listened to the echo of the door slamming shut in our now-empty home and calmly called the maternity ward and a postnatal care center.  
  
A man who didn’t even notice my water had broken dared to swear he’d return in time for the birth.  
  
How laughable.  
  
Eric and I met through a mountaineering club.  
  
Back then, I worked at a tech company under intense pressure. I regularly worked overtime, and the only time I could breathe was on weekends when I hiked to recover some energy.  
  
He joined the club in my second year there. At first, we were just regular teammates, but we always charged ahead together, always the first to reach the summit. Over time, we grew close.  
  
He worked in investment banking.  
  
I worked in internet tech.  
  
He liked hiking, running, and working out.  
  
So did I.  
  
When we summited our hundredth mountain, he confessed his love to me.  
  
No fancy words, no over-the-top romance.  
  
Just one sentence: “Freya, let’s be together.”  
  
I agreed.  
  
Not because he was especially charming—my father was the king of romance. When he pursued my mother, he lit up half the city with fireworks and even got arrested for disturbing the peace.  
  
But that passion ultimately destroyed my mother. When she was pregnant with their second child, my father’s mistress showed up, deliberately provoking my mother who was about to go into labor—and it killed her on the operating table.  
  
So I’d long since realized: romance is cheap. Reliability is what matters.  
  
And Eric was reliable.  
  
He was never late.  
  
His gifts were always cliché, but he never forgot a single occasion.  
  
He wouldn’t pick me up when it rained, but the moment I called, he’d come without hesitation.  
  
So, after three years of dating, we got married.  
  
Married life wasn’t much different from before.  
  
We split chores equally. On holidays, we took turns choosing vacation spots—one trip to a place he liked, one to a place I liked.  
  
It was calm, orderly, and uneventful.  
  
I once believed I was made for this kind of life.  
  
Until three years ago, when one of his college friends got married, and he brought me along to the wedding.  
  
At the bachelor party, one of his very drunk friends pulled him aside and cried:  
  
“Eric, seeing you like this—with no spark in your eyes—breaks my heart.”  
  
“I’m getting married tomorrow. I’m finally stepping into happiness. But you… you’re like someone who’s locked his heart away.”  
  
“If Aria hadn’t insisted on becoming a war reporter, you wouldn’t have ended up like this.”  
  
I saw Eric glance at me, instinctively.  
  
He quickly explained, “He’s drunk. Don’t listen to him.”  
  
I just smiled and said nothing.  
  
On the way home, leaning in the passenger seat, I said calmly, “I don’t ask for much in a partner. But the one thing I need is for him to be over his ex.”  
  
He stood where the hallway light couldn’t reach, so I couldn’t see his expression.  
  
But from that night on, the name Aria vanished from our lives.  
  
Until now.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Because I hadn’t been answering calls.  
  
I had just finished nursing our daughter at the postnatal center and was about to put her to sleep when the door suddenly flew open.  
  
It was my mother-in-law, Victoria.  
  
She rushed in, her voice trembling:  
  
“Freya, why haven’t you been answering your phone? William’s at the embassy, practically losing his mind!”  
  
“Come home with me right now. Bring Eric’s passport and documents—we have to get to the embassy immediately and confirm what’s happening.”  
  
William was my father-in-law.  
  
I didn’t respond right away. I calmly said six digits: “2-1-0-6-3-0.”  
  
She froze.  
  
I carefully tucked the blanket around my daughter before slowly explaining, “That’s the code to the front door. If you need his documents, you can get them yourself.”  
  
Victoria’s hands trembled.  
  
“Freya, how can you be so cold? Eric is in a war zone—his life’s in danger.”  
  
“He sent a group message asking for help. He’s been shot in the leg and is hiding in a stranger’s home, trying to dodge gunfire!”  
  
“I know you just had surgery and need time to recover, but this is an emergency. Can’t you just come with me to the embassy, just once?”  
  
She was shaking all over, looking like she might break down at any second.  
  
I still spoke calmly. “I knew he was injured. Before he sent out that mass message, he had already sent me several desperate pleas for help. I didn’t reply.”  
  
Victoria staggered, nearly losing her balance.  
  
I looked at her, and I won’t deny I wavered a little inside.  
  
After all, for the past seven years, she had treated me well. During the years I was without a mother, she had filled that void.  
  
But all of that had already been destroyed—by Eric himself.  
  
I took a USB drive from the nightstand and handed it to her.  
  
“This is a recording of the conversation between me and Eric that night. Watch it first, then we’ll talk.”  
  
Victoria took it with trembling hands. When the video ended, she collapsed to the floor. Her lips quivered for a long time before she finally managed to speak.  
  
“Freya… you have to believe me. Nothing ever happened between Eric and Aria.”  
  
I still couldn’t harden my heart completely. Even though the pain from my C-section was still sharp, I forced myself to get out of bed and helped her up.  
  
Just like that day when Eric left—I had already gone into labor, my water had broken—but I still softened and handed him his passport and bank card.  
  
I said gently, “I know nothing physical happened between him and Aria. But the fact that he was willing to leave his wife and unborn child behind to fly into a war zone for her—that says everything about his choice.”  
  
“He was willing to let my daughter be born without her father. He was willing to let me face the surgery alone. A man like that should be held accountable for his decisions.”  
  
As I spoke, Victoria’s face grew paler and paler. In the end, she didn’t argue further.  
  
Maybe even she couldn’t find a reason to convince me.  
  
She finally gave up and stood up, her body trembling. “You… get some rest. I’ll leave now.”  
  
She walked out the door looking like she’d aged ten years in an instant, stumbling as she went.  
  
Although I truly felt sorry for her, I still called out before she could leave completely.  
  
“Victoria, let me know sometime this week when you and William can move out of that apartment.”  
  
They had been living in a property I had fully paid for, ever since I got married.  
  
Victoria turned back, exhaustion written all over her face.  
  
“Do you really have to rush this? Can’t you wait a little?”  
  
I shook my head.  
  
“Did Eric wait? When he left, he didn’t even take me—whose water had already broken—to the hospital first. He just flew out of the country.”  
  
“I just want all the marital property matters settled before he comes back.”

Felmerül a kérdés: van-e ténylegesen értelme ilyen nagy teljesítményű autót használni rendőri munkára, amikor egy Skoda Octavia RS szinte minden gyakorlati igényt kielégít? A legtöbb üldözés nem a lóerőn múlik, hanem a szervezettségen, kommunikáción és stratégián.

1kyycib,https://i.redd.it/tl6ie7gdiv3f1.jpeg,My Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning Review,"𝐋𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐢𝐭 𝐨𝐫 𝐧𝐨𝐭, 𝐰𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐚𝐭𝐞. 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐬 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧.

There are action franchises, and then there’s Mission: Impossible- the one that looked at gravity and said, Not today. Ever since I first saw a guy named Ethan Hunt sneak into Langley to steal a NOC list with nothing but wirework, gumption, and nerve, I was hooked. Ever since, I have always been a, huge would be an understatement, fan of the series. This franchise raised me, thrilled me, taught me that silence can be as dangerous as an explosion, and that Tom Cruise is, frankly, not human.

Coming off of what I saw in the last part, expectations for this film was through the roof- a final film, something that would end it all, one last outing for Bravo Echo 1-1. One last mission. I had entered the theatre with high hopes, hyped up as fuck, and when coming out, let's say it was a good movie, but I wasn't really wrecked.

The good part first. Tom Cruise, even at 62, is as evergreen as ever. He is fucking amazing, so passionate and . When the stakes are as high as they can get, Cruise delivers the performance of a lifetime. The film is so very well made, the action sequences are, as every time, brilliant, and the progression feels well-paced and entertaining at most times. That, I feel, has always been one of M:I’s greatest tricks: dancing between chaos and clarity without letting you see the strings. The underwater escape scene is haunting and claustrophic, leaves you gasping for air. And Ethan Hunt hanging from the wing of an airplane on one hand. Simply breathtaking, squirmishly uncomfortable. Makes you hold on to your armrests the entire time. McQuarrie just knows how to do this shit. The film is not perfect, but its an apt send off for one of the greatest fictional characters ever created.

I wouldn't like to delve into detailed criticism, given how emotionally I am attached to this franchise, but still, certain remarks have to be made. I'll put it like someone returning to their hometown only to find the old bookstore gone, the coffee weaker, the silence thicker. The story isn't the best. It's pretty weak, too predictable, like the writers were so busy planning set pieces that they forgot to load the narrative with the same stakes. Sometimes the plot twists don't give you the feels as they used to in the previous films. Serviceable, sure, but not revolutionary. Not what the M:I franchise has been constantly delivering to us since the third installment. The humor, albeit brilliant and well written, feels a bit forced at times. Moments meant to be quippy sometimes landed like a dad joke at a funeral. The puzzle pieces fit, but they don’t surprise. And there's a huge emotional disconnect, it begins to feel like a Bollywood film sometimes, and not in a good way.

But still, it works out. For people like me, Ethan Hunt isn't just a character. He’s an era. A constant. He was always there: running, leaping, saving, risking it all for the mission. Critiquing that feels like telling your childhood self Santa isn’t real.
It is a finale that thrills, but doesn't quite feel complete. So what do we do? We hold it close. We thank it for the ride. Thank you Tom for everything. All eight films, all innumerable emotions, all those experiences. You remind people why we care about movies in the first place; not just for spectacle, but for soul.

Ethan Hunt isn’t just a spy; he’s a symbol. So here’s to the man who ran. Not just across rooftops and tarmacs, but through generations. Through our hearts.

If this truly is the end, thank you, Ethan. The message might have been self-destructed in five seconds, but these films will never.

""Kaelyn knows about our wedding, and now she's threatening to jump off a building. You are aware of her depression, aren't you? I have to go save her,"" Theo explained impatiently and pushed Elyse aside.  
  
""Today is our wedding day! What am I supposed to do if you leave? Kaelyn Bennett totally stabbed you in the back before. She's caused you so much pain-why the heck must you go see her right now?""  
  
The push caused Elyse to sprain her ankle, and as she fell to the floor, she awkwardly stretched out her hand, trying to hold him back.  
  
Theo's gaze turned even colder. ""You're not in a position to judge what happened between me and Kaelyn. No matter her wrongs or the pain she caused, you don't measure up to her.""  
  
A pain struck Elyse's heart. She realized that he had never truly forgotten Kaelyn. To him, she would never be as significant as Kaelyn was.  
  
""What did I do to deserve this? Why are you treating me this way? Please, just wait until the wedding is over. We're almost at the point of exchanging rings. You can leave after that.""  
  
Theo dodged her hand and said with disgust, ""You're more concerned with your wedding than a living person's life. You're so heartless. Let's reschedule the wedding.""  
  
Without a glance at her pale face, he strode away from the ornate altar, oblivious to the puzzled looks of gathered guests.  
  
As the groom left, the crowd erupted into chaos.  
  
""No, please don't leave me, Theo! What should I do if you leave?"" Elyse cried out, sitting pitifully on the floor. She trembled, tears ruining her carefully applied makeup.  
  
The man she had loved for three years, disregarding her dignity, had chosen another woman without a second thought on their big day. He was consumed with thoughts of Kaelyn's distress but seemed indifferent to how lost and humiliated she felt, left alone at the altar.  
All around her, countless eyes watched, some mocking, some pitying, and others even gloating. Elyse had never felt such torment!  
  
Her father, Lanny Lloyd, approached. She hoped for comfort, but instead, he scolded her sharply, ""You can't even keep a man. How useless!"" After berating her, he left with his wife, Glenda Lloyd, without a backward glance.  
  
Her sister, Mabel Lloyd, emerged from the crowd with a smirk. ""Well, that's embarrassing, Elyse. Your groom ran off, and now you're a laughingstock. I'm embarrassed for you. Imagine how Mom and Dad feel."" After saying that, she turned and left.  
  
One by one, all of Elyse's family members departed, leaving her completely alone. Initially, Theo's parents felt guilty, but upon witnessing her family's reaction, all traces of guilt dissipated.  
  
""Even her own parents didn't support her. It seems this isn't entirely Theo's fault.""  
  
""Yes, if she were a good partner, why would her fiancé leave her?""  
  
""Did she cheat on him? What else would make a groom leave like that?""  
  
The murmurs of criticism from the surrounding guests grew louder and harsher.  
  
Suddenly, there were noises nearby.  
  
Turning around, Elyse spotted a man in a suit sitting alone in a wheelchair. The officiant, looking flustered, asked, ""Where is your bride?""  
  
Wiping away her tears, she halted a passing staff member and inquired, ""That man is a groom, right? Where is his bride?""  
  
The staff member glanced at her and responded, ""She didn't show up. I heard it was because she couldn't deal with her husband's disability.""  
  
""And he's been waiting here all this time?""  
  
The staff member nodded.  
  
The wheelchair-bound groom was facing away from Elyse, and they were a fair distance apart. She couldn't see his expression, but she understood the pain of being left alone.  
They were both unfortunate souls, abandoned.  
  
After a moment of reflection, a determined look settled in Elyse's eyes.  
  
She had loved Theo for three years, but he had betrayed her. Why should she remain loyal to him? She realized she didn't need to be with him at all.  
  
As she suddenly stood up, the guests who had been whispering and mocking her fell silent. All eyes instinctively focused on her as she lifted the hem of her dress and confidently walked toward the man in the wheelchair.  
  
The sight of a bride in a white wedding dress approaching left the man's guests equally stunned.  
  
Hearing the rustle of her dress, the man in the wheelchair turned around slowly.  
  
Elyse halted and gazed at the handsome man before her, a spark of surprise in her eyes. She then extended her hand and said, ""Hello, I heard you're in need of a bride. My groom just left me. How about we get married?""  
  
  
Chapter2 What Was She Up To?  
""My name is Elyse Lloyd. If it's all right with you, we can get married today,"" she proposed confidently.  
  
Her bold proposal left the crowd in shock, prompting several to capture the moment with their phones.  
  
""Miss Lloyd, are you certain about this decision? Given my disability, I may not be able to provide the future you envision,"" the man replied openly, without hiding his condition, and gently urged her to think it over.  
  
""I've made up my mind,"" Elyse responded with determination.  
  
""I'm Jayden,"" he introduced himself.  
  
Seeing her resolve, Jayden Owen grasped her hand and shared his concern, ""I fear you might regret this choice later on.""  
  
Elyse chose not to respond. She was sure of her decision. She had once been solely focused on marrying Theo, who never truly reciprocated her love. Now, who she married seemed inconsequential.  
  
After efficiently wrapping up the wedding formalities at City Hall, Elyse and Jayden were now bound by matrimony, officially united as husband and wife.  
  
With the marriage certificate in hand, Elyse experienced a profound sense of relief.  
  
Theo had broken her heart, and she was resolute in never returning to him.  
  
Regarding her father, since she would not be marrying into the Ward family, he had another daughter to think about.  
  
She understood her little sister Mabel too well. As someone driven by greed, how could Mabel resist the temptation to become Theo's wife and a member of the Ward family?  
  
Thus, marrying Jayden was Elyse's perfect escape from her family's clutches. She had no intention of going back home again.  
  
While she gazed thoughtfully at the marriage certificate, Jayden asked, ""What's on your mind? Regretting your decision to marry a disabled man?""  
  
Elyse shook her head, took hold of the wheelchair, and replied, ""I think it was a good decision.""  
  
Jayden smiled slightly, though his eyes betrayed a hint of skepticism and mistrust.  
  
How could any woman genuinely want to marry a disabled man? He figured she was just putting on an act-an act that couldn't last forever.  
  
He needed a bride momentarily to distract his family while he pursued his own goals. Well, he decided, he might as well see what she was up to.  
  
Elyse helped Jayden into the car, and they drove to his house.  
  
Jayden's home was opulent, complete with a garden and a swimming pool, and staffed with a butler in a tuxedo and uniformed maids.  
  
As Elyse stepped onto the plush wool carpet, she truly realized that her new husband was far from ordinary.  
  
The butler, Driscoll Lee, approached them respectfully and inquired, ""Mr. Owen, is this your bride?""  
  
Surveying the opulent house and recollecting her newlywed husband's full name, a sudden realization dawned on Elyse.  
  
The Owens were the most influential family in town, and Jayden Owen was particularly notable among his peers for his business acumen and exceptional talent. He was one of the wealthiest men around. However, after a car accident a year ago that cost him his legs, Jayden had faded from the public eye and his prior achievements were largely forgotten.  
  
So, she had married the legendary Jayden Owen?  
  
Elyse recalled hearing rumors about his engagement to a girl from the Foster family. The bride who had disappeared on her wedding day was supposed to be that Foster girl.  
  
Upon hearing Jayden's full name at City Hall, Elyse hadn't dwelled on it much. If she had known his background sooner, she wouldn't have had the courage to broach the topic of marriage with him.  
  
Jayden noticed the shock and panic on her face but remained silent. He still doubted that she truly hadn't recognized him. After all, his disability was well known.  
  
""This is Elyse Lloyd, my wife. From now on, she will be the hostess here,"" Jayden introduced her firmly.  
  
""Joanna Foster escaped on our wedding day because she didn't want to marry a disabled man,"" he added bluntly.  
  
""Joanna Foster disappeared on the wedding day?"" Driscoll expressed his surprise. The Foster family had been eager to forge a union with the Owen family through marriage, pushing for Jayden to marry Joanna.  
  
On the wedding day, however, the bride had disappeared. Wasn't this a deliberate humiliation of Jayden?  
  
Driscoll felt sympathy for him and offered some consolation, ""Sir, perhaps it's for the best that she left. It seems you might have found the right person after all.""  
  
Elyse had shown no concern for Jayden's disability and was willing to marry him. That indeed counted for something.  
  
  
Chapter3 He Could Walk Fluidly  
Looking at Jayden's legs, Elyse felt a wave of sympathy for him. Jayden had once been at the pinnacle of success, and now he seemed so vulnerable. Just because he was disabled, his bride had callously abandoned him at the altar, showing him no respect whatsoever. He must have felt even more devastated than she did during the wedding.  
  
Approaching Jayden, Elyse took his hand and said earnestly, ""Don't worry. We are husband and wife now. I will take care of you for the rest of our lives.""  
  
Jayden's expression turned rigid. Could she really mean it, promising to take care of him for a lifetime? He doubted her sincerity, thinking she was just putting on an act of compassion.  
  
Without a word, Jayden maneuvered his wheelchair into the study on the first floor.  
  
""I'm sorry,"" Driscoll said apologetically. ""Since his accident, he's been a bit more temperamental.""  
  
""It's fine. I understand,"" Elyse replied, dismissing it with a wave of her hand. Anyone in his situation might change.  
  
She then followed Driscoll upstairs to a room on the second floor.  
  
\--  
  
""Sir.""  
  
In the study stood a bald man named Vinny Bailey, clad in a tight black shirt that accentuated his prominent tendons.  
  
Respectfully, Vinny ignited a lighter and lit a cigar for Jayden.  
  
""Joanna has gone abroad. The Foster family is desperately trying to come up with a solution.""  
  
""They've taken thirty million and five major projects from me. Is this their way of repaying me?""  
  
Jayden let out a puff of smoke and remarked casually, ""If I don't teach them a lesson, others will see me as a pushover. The Fosters need to learn a few things.""  
  
""Do you want us to bring Joanna back?"" Vinny inquired, nodding. ""And as for your new wife, should we make some introductions with our men?""  
  
""No need.""  
  
Jayden, cigar clenched between his teeth, lifted a document from the desk and strolled over to the window.  
  
The wheelchair was tucked away in a corner of the room, ignored, as he moved fluidly across the floor.  
  
This document detailed Elyse's entire life, from her childhood through to her college life, even including her romance with Theo.  
  
He casually flipped through the pages and drawled, ""An ordinary woman. She married me just for my money.""  
Back then, the Owens had declared their search for a wife for Jayden, aiming simply to secure an heir.  
  
Upon the announcement, no wealthy family was eager to marry their daughter to him, except for the Fosters, who had enriched themselves through their daughters' marriage.  
  
The Fosters' motive was straightforward-to exchange their daughter for resources and money.  
  
Vinny saw no other reason for Elyse to marry Jayden but for financial gain.  
  
Yet, there was another twist. ""She was originally going to marry Theo Ward.""  
  
""Ward? The Ward family that's well-known?"" Jayden lifted an eyebrow.  
  
""Yes. But apparently, the groom ran off to reunite with his ex-girlfriend after receiving a phone call.""  
  
Vinny paused, then speculated, ""Maybe she married you just to spite Theo Ward.""  
  
Jayden ceased perusing the documents and glanced up at Vinny with a hint of annoyance. ""You're looking at it too simplistically. By marrying me, she stands to gain more. That's the real reason she married me, despite my disability.""  
  
In Jayden's eyes, Elyse hadn't yet revealed her true intentions. But he didn't mind her interest in his money.  
  
He needed a wife to appease his family. If she married him for gain, it would make a future divorce simpler for him.  
  
\--  
  
Perched on the edge of the bed, Elysee scrolled through her phone and noticed the trending topics.  
  
\#Bridegroom Ran Away For His Ex  
  
\#Bride Marries Stranger To Anger Her Ranaway Groom  
  
She casually scrolled through the comments. The public deemed the entire situation unbelievable and both parties' actions as unreasonable. Nevertheless, discussions had thrust Elyse's name into circulation because of it.  
  
Some even discovered she was a violinist in an orchestra and stumbled upon a video of her past performance.  
  
Unable to resist, Elyse was watching these videos when Theo called. ""Where are you, Elyse? Let's meet and talk.""  
  
  
Chapter4 Who Were You Married To?  
As Elyse descended the stairs to the villa's entrance, Driscoll approached her with concern. ""It's quite late. Where are you off to? Shall I arrange a car for you?""  
  
""No, thanks. I'll be back soon.""  
  
Driscoll watched her depart before heading to the study.  
  
Elyse, having agreed to meet Theo, called a taxi and was soon en route.  
  
Fifteen minutes later, she entered a coffee shop and instantly noticed Theo, who was in high spirits, busy texting on his phone. A flicker of sarcasm crossed her eyes as she approached and sat across from him.  
  
Theo looked up, his expression souring. ""Why are you so late? Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting?""  
  
Staring back at him, Elyse felt a chill. They had been together for a long time, yet he was always domineering toward her, a stark contrast to his demeanor with Kaelyn.  
  
She had once loved him, believing she could endure anything. Only today had she realized how foolish that was.  
  
If she didn't love herself, how could she expect anyone else to love her?  
  
""If you don't want to wait, you can leave,"" Elyse retorted icily.  
  
Theo, taken aback by her response, grew visibly more upset. ""You're holding a grudge about what happened at the wedding, aren't you? I get why you're upset, but you can't be more understanding and reasonable? I left because Kaelyn was in dire straits-she was depressed and contemplating suicide.""  
  
""You can go to anyone you want. You don't need to explain anything to me-I don't care anymore."" Elyse found humor in his words.  
  
Theo couldn't believe she was indifferent. They had been together for three years, and everyone knew how deeply she loved him.  
  
He thought her claim of indifference was merely a result of anger. But he was confident he could easily resolve this. Just a few sweet words and she'd come back to him.  
  
""It's not a big deal. I came back to you after handling everything, didn't I? I'll visit your parents soon, and we can start planning the wedding again,"" Theo said.  
  
""No need for that.""  
  
""What?""  
  
""There won't be a wedding."" Elyse's face was devoid of emotion. ""We're done.""  
  
""Why are you still upset? I left at the wedding, but I came back for you. Can't you forgive me?"" Theo frowned.  
  
""Forgive you? Forgive you for abandoning me for another woman?"" Elyse slammed her hand on the table. ""Do you have any idea what I've been through since you left? Your family has been calling me names, even though you were the one who left me at the altar- just for another woman!""  
  
""Elyse Lloyd!"" Theo shouted her name furiously. ""What others say is their issue. Isn't our three-year relationship strong enough for you to trust me?""  
  
""Three years, and yet you never forgot your ex,"" Elyse countered, her face marked by disappointment. ""I believed we'd be together forever, but it seems three years was our limit. We're done, Theo. It's clear we're not suited for each other.""  
  
While speaking, she retrieved a ring from her bag and set it down on the table-the same ring he had used to propose.  
  
She recalled the joy she felt that day, now overshadowed by her current despair.  
  
Elyse gave Theo one last look, mentally closing the chapter on their three years together. She grabbed her bag and departed without a backward glance.  
  
Theo was stunned. Was Elyse dumping him? He always saw her as a simp, her family reliant on his. How could she just walk away?  
  
Humiliated, he chased after her, grabbed her shoulder, and said forcefully, ""You have no right to break things off! Remember, your father's business relies on me. Without me, your family has nothing. Come back, and we'll marry in a few days to make up for today!""  
  
""Let me go!"" Elyse fought back fiercely and yelled with defiance and frustration, ""I'm married. Stop bothering me!""  
  
""So what if you are married! You will always belong to me.""  
  
After blurting that out, he froze and asked incredulously, ""What did you say? You're married? Who to?""  
  
While he was momentarily dazed, Elyse wriggled free from his grip. She hadn't anticipated turning around to find Jayden sitting in a wheelchair quietly a few meters behind her. ""Jayden!"" she exclaimed.  
  
  
Chapter5 You Can Stand?  
""Didn't I make it clear? I'm married. We're over. This is my husband,"" Elyse said as she quickly moved to Jayden's side, gripping his arm.  
  
Theo stared at Jayden, failing to recognize him. With a sneer, he said, ""To get back at me, you married a disabled man?"" He then extended his hand, commanding in a domineering tone, ""Elyse, come here! I'll make it up to you when we get back.""  
  
But Elyse looked at him as if he were a stranger.  
  
""Did you hear me? Come here!"" Theo grew frustrated.  
  
Elyse reflected on how she would have responded in the past-she would definitely walk over to his side.  
  
She had loved him deeply for three years. Her feelings had been genuine. Yet, the depth of her affection made the betrayal harder to bear.  
  
On her first birthday after they got together, she wanted to celebrate it by the sea. To make her happy, Theo bought a camera, promising to capture beautiful photos of her. As they were about to board the plane for their trip to the seaside, Kaelyn was injured on a film set and called Theo. Without any hesitation, Theo left her stranded at the airport. It was the most disappointing birthday Elyse had ever experienced.  
  
Theo had once vowed to attend her debut performance with her orchestra, yet she ended up not seeing him there. She lingered in the hall all night, only to learn the next day that he had missed the performance because Kaelyn had become drunk at a dinner party while trying to land a role. He stayed because he was worried she might be taken advantage of.  
For three years, he had been Kaelyn's protector, but he had never offered Elyse the same safeguard.  
  
This accumulation of disappointments came to a head at the wedding. She knew she deserved love and respect, not neglect.  
  
""I am Jayden's wife now. I owe my loyalty to him,"" declared Elyse with a chill in her voice.  
  
""Elyse Lloyd!"" Theo roared, enraged. He thought Elyse was merely being spiteful and fabricating things due to the day's incidents.  
  
As he tried to seize her hand, Jayden intervened, blocking him swiftly.  
  
Theo struggled to free his hand, but was unable to. He couldn't overpower a disabled man? The realization pissed him off.  
  
""Release me!"" Theo exploded with anger.  
  
""She has no desire to leave with you. Can't you understand?"" Jayden pressed slowly, his force causing Theo's features to twist in distress.  
  
Jayden held on until Theo cried out in pain before releasing him.  
  
""Remember this day, Elyse. You'll regret it in the future!"" With a hint of embarrassment, Theo glared at Elyse and stormed off after his declaration.  
  
Watching him leave, Elyse felt a bitter smile form within her. She knew Theo would not easily let go of being humiliated, but there was no turning back for them now.  
  
""Let's go home, Elyse.""  
  
""Okay.""  
  
After helping Jayden into the car, they both sat silently, gazing out the window and avoiding any mention of Theo.  
  
""How did you know I was out here?"" Elyse asked, her curiosity piqued.  
  
Without turning to face her, Jayden replied, ""Driscoll mentioned it wasn't safe for you to be alone at this hour, so I came to pick you up.""  
  
In truth, he had suspected she was up to something secretive, but it turned out she was merely meeting her ex. This revelation left him slightly disappointed.  
  
""Since you've married me, you should sever ties with your ex. My family members are strict, and I can't cover for you if they find out you're still seeing another man.""  
  
""I won't see him again. I met him just to return a ring,"" Elyse responded, nodding.  
  
Jayden said nothing more. As long as Elyse respected his boundaries, she was free to make her own choices.  
  
When they arrived home, Elyse noticed Jayden heading straight for the study again. Curious, she asked Driscoll, ""Why is he always in the study?""  
  
""The study is not only his workplace, but it has also become a sanctuary for his soul,"" Driscoll explained.  
  
""And why doesn't he return to his room?""  
  
""He does sometimes, but we rarely know when. He prefers that we don't fuss over him too much.""  
  
With that, Driscoll departed. After freshening up in her room, Elyse was preparing for bed, but her thoughts lingered on the day's events with Jayden. She realized that despite his reserved nature, he was genuinely concerned for her safety.  
  
Feeling grateful and wanting to express her thanks, she left her room and walked towards the study. As she approached, she noticed the door was slightly ajar, casting a sliver of light into the hallway.  
  
Elyse pushed the door open and to her surprise, saw Jayden standing. She gasped and asked, ""Jayden, you can stand?""  
  
……  
  
====  
""You need a bride, I need a groom. Why don't we get married?"" Both abandoned at the altar, Elyse decided to tie the knot with the disabled stranger from the venue next door.   
Pitying his state, she vowed to spoil him once they were married. Little did she know that he was actually a powerful and healthy tycoon.   
Was Jayden's fake disability revealed just like that?

I’ve been looking onto people here, and you all seem so supportive, so I’m hoping you can help me. I’m 19F, from Ethiopia, and I’m really struggling to get over my first boyfriend. Sorry if this is long or messy, I’ve never done this before.So, I met my ex (20M) about two years ago when we were in our last year of high school. He was in my friend group, and we got close. We started dating a bit after graduation, and it was my first real relationship, so it felt like a big deal. He was so sweet at first. we’d text all day, go for walks to grab coffee or shiro at local spots, and he even made me a playlist for my birthday. I was so happy, like something out of a movie.But after a few months, things got weird. He started acting distant, like he’d take ages to reply or say he was “busy” with no explanation. I’d see him posting on Instagram Stories hanging out with friends, but he’d barely make time for me. I tried asking what was wrong, but he’d just say “nothing” or get annoyed. It made me feel like I was doing something wrong. After about eight months, I broke up with him because I couldn’t handle feeling ignored anymore. It was really hard. I cried for days, and my friends were so worried about me.Now it’s been almost a year, and I still can’t stop thinking about him. It’s not like I want him back (he wasn’t great in the end), but I keep remembering the good times, like when we’d dance to Tems at a friend’s party. I recently saw on a mutual friend’s story that he’s been hanging out with a new girl, and it made my stomach drop. I feel so stupid for caring when I’m the one who ended it. I’ve been trying to keep busy. I’m in my first year of university now, studying a lot, and I’ve started doing some sketching for fun, but every time I’m alone, my mind goes back to him.Is it normal to feel this stuck after almost a year? How do I stop these memories from popping up? And why am I so jealous about him with someone else? I just want to move on and feel like myself again. Any advice or stories about getting over your first love would mean a lot. Thanks for reading, and sorry if I sound all over the place...",2,1748590580.0,heartbreak,1,1.0,False
1kyya2k,https://i.redd.it/1y96qvbchv3f1.jpeg,Is this the answer to why my second shot was always different?,"Whilst building my own coffee mod for the Gaggia Classic I noticed that pressure is held in the pump and pump line after a shot.

I have a GCP, but maybe the same with any machine with a solenoid?

So when I pulled my first shot I reached full pressure, standard. But when I finished the shot I still had 10 bar in the line where the sensor is. This is in the line from the pump to the group head.

So when I pull go on my next shot all that pressure instantly goes on to the puck instantly!

I monitored this pressure and is very, very, slowly goes down. So the next day it would be back at almost zero.

So if you're having issues with your second shot (making 2 coffees) which I did, try this:

TLDR: After pulling your first shot removed the porta filter and click the pump on and off for half a second. This will activate the solenoid valve and remove the pressure that may still be in your lines.

1kyy9rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerSaving/comments/1kyy9rd/what_are_your_goto_tricks_for_lowering_your/,What are your go-to tricks for lowering your electric bill?,"I’m curious - what are some *realistic* things people here actually do to cut back on electricity use at home?

My bill’s not crazy high, but it’s been climbing slowly over the past year. I’m already doing the basic stuff like turning off lights, unplugging chargers, and using LED bulbs, but I feel like there’s more I could try without spending a fortune or rewiring my place.

Here’s a short list of what I’ve been doing and testing so far - would love to hear what’s worked for others too.

**1. Smart plugs + timers**  
I put a few of my electronics on smart plugs that shut off automatically at night. It’s especially helpful for my work-from-home setup, which otherwise would be sipping power 24/7. I think it’s saved me *a little*, but it’s hard to measure.

**2. Using fans instead of blasting AC**  
I’ve started running ceiling fans more often, and it makes a big difference. Keeps the place cooler without relying as much on air conditioning, especially at night. Definitely lowered my summer bills a bit.

**3. Cold water laundry + air drying when possible**  
Switched to cold water cycles a while ago and started drying half my clothes on a rack instead of always using the dryer. It’s slower, but I’m seeing some impact, especially since I do laundry a few times a week.

**4. Tried a plug-in energy saver device**  
So this one I was a little unsure about. I tried one of those **electricity saver devices** (the brand was **ESaver Watt**) that you plug into an outlet near your breaker box. It’s marketed as an **energy saver box** that reduces “dirty electricity” and stabilizes voltage, possibly helping appliances run more efficiently.

Did it cut my bill in half? No. But I think it helped a little. After 4–6 weeks, my usage dropped by maybe 5% compared to the same time last year. Could be coincidence or other changes, but it didn’t hurt anything and might be useful for homes with older wiring or high usage.

I wouldn’t say it’s for everyone, but it was a decent low-effort test. Curious if anyone else here has tried something similar.

[**More details**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/255WLFTQ/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/PowerSaving)

**5. Sealing windows and doors**  
I did some quick weatherproofing with foam strips and draft blockers last winter and was surprised how much warmer the place felt. I imagine it’s helping the AC now too.

**Open to more ideas**  
What’s something you tried that actually worked? Whether it’s big (like solar panels) or small (like unplugging your coffee maker), I’d love to hear real feedback. Bonus points if it’s a set-it-and-forget-it fix.",1,1748590531.0,PowerSaving,0,1.0,False

A bit about me:
I’ve only been in the area for a year but I’m enjoying hiking, camping, and just generally getting out and about. I’m a huge cafe fan and will happily explore Brisbane city looking for random spots that might do slightly better coffee than the last. 

I also enjoy gaming and spend most of my weeknights playing some FPS games on my PC (CS, Valorant, Overwatch). 

For work: I’m an engineer, I’m currently studying a Master’s and procrastinating an assignment (which is absolutely why I’m here).

The holyfrickinairball video she made about Jordyn and Josiah looking just like Erin is so sad. She completely left bean out, when in fact, I feel like Jordyn and bean look the most like Erin. Of course, she put Josiah and Jordyn only. It’s so sad to me because you know she puts Erin on a pedestal now that she has passed away, probably out of extreme guilt but the kids know this and I have even heard them bring up Erin to get attention from Denise. Jordyn has compared herself to Erin multiple times and Denise loves it and sulks it all in. I understand they lost their sibling and I could not imagine that feeling but I can’t imagine how those kids feel trying to basically compare to Erin. Even her other video of her bringing her mom coffee bean, Roberta only had a picture of deputy doofus David and a picture of her and Erin. If she did have other pictures of the grandkids, Denise didn’t care to show them. She only likes her older kids, it’s plain as day. I rarely ever see Josiah’s twin or her other boy that is the second youngest. Poor bean really is treated differently and left out. It’s crazy to make a video about which kids look like your deceased daughter but not include the kid that looks like her the most. She is literally pitting them against each other. I am sure Erin loved him so much and was like a mother to him too so it makes it that much more sadder. Denise has set it up to where her kids have to beg for her attention or buy her materialistic items to receive love for her. Her saying she is a “yes mom” was also crazy, she is only a “yes mom” depending on which kid wants something. From experience, bean will most likely go no contact with them as soon as he moves out and I do not blame him. One of the most hurtful things a child can witness is blatant favoritism, especially when it comes to siblings. It also creates turmoil within their sibling relationships and a lot of siblings grow up to despise the siblings who was favored. I can’t imagine how Josiah is allowed to treat him.

1kyy7ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kyy7ah/i_became_roommates_with_my_best_friend_and_it_is/,"I became roommates with my best friend and it is miserable, not sure what to do now.","I would like to preface by saying that I have been long term friends with my roommate for over 10 years. I absolutely love her to death, but I can’t stand living with her. I know everyone always says not to live with a friend, but I thought it would be a good idea to live with her because we are very similar and I thought she would be a little more chill. 

I don’t really know where to start with this so I’m sorry if it’s a little all over the place. We fell out of touch for about 3 years prior to us living together after graduating, so I didn’t know much about her post high school. In high school, I had always thought she was really well put together but now I’m starting to question that. We have been living together for two years now and I’m not sure how much more I can take. 

There’s a lot that’s been bothering me but the first thing is her cleanliness. I always thought her spotless room meant she knew how to clean up after herself. Come to find out, her mom would clean up after her every single time. She doesn’t know how to clean anything. She rinses the silverware with cold water and puts it back in the drawer. She leaves dishes out on the counter for days until I end up cleaning it out of frustration. Every time the apartment is cleaned, I am the one to do it. The least she will do is clean the shower? Idk why but she always sees that I have cleaned and offers to clean the shower. Not the bathroom. The shower. This is one of my lesser concerns. 

Another concern is that she refuses to respect my time and boundaries. The past few semesters, I have been struggling to keep up with my workload because she constantly needs me to be around her doing whatever she wants. She’ll come into my room when I’m clearly doing homework and beg me to go to target or tj maxx or to get coffee with her. If I initially say no she will beg and beg and beg until I say yes. And if I don’t say yes at that point she’ll leave my room and just come back every 5 or so minutes to beg again. It’s obvious she doesn’t respect my time or boundaries and she knows I struggle with setting boundaries so it just seems like she’s intentionally crossing one of the only boundaries I do have with her. 

Another thing is this weird competition that she has by herself with me all the time. She considers my major an “easy major” compared to hers. Shes a nursing major if that tells you anything. I’m an English major. No, it’s not the most difficult major, but for me it’s extremely time consuming. I also have terrible academic anxiety and awful time management. So it makes the stress a lot worse. It takes me awhile to get things done sometimes and she’s always on my ass about it. If I’m stressing about a paper she always without fail tells me that if that’s “all she had to do” she would get 100s on everything because she’s so good at writing. Also mind you I wrote all her papers for her last semester. So that’s kinda funny to me. A lot of times it’s more subtle jabs but it’s so constant that it really makes me question my intelligence. 

This isn’t really on the same topic, but she is so hypocritical about certain things that I don’t even know how to process it. She will leave the apartment unlocked every time she leaves for a week straight and then send me a paragraph about how I need to start locking the apartment when I leave no matter what time of day it is. But then get mad when it’s locked while I’m there. Or I will clean the entire apartment, as I regularly do, and she’ll make sure to tell me that I should have taken out the garbage too, which is something else she never does and always leaves for me. And then sometimes she just gets mad at me for being at the apartment. She will get home from work and side eye me on the couch and scoff and walk into her room and ignore me all night. Then next morning she’s back to normal. It’s so so so weird to me and it happens frequently but at really random moments. 

Now, this is where it gets really weird. She has a job and she also has her grandmas credit card to use for anything she wants. She says it’s only for “groceries” but she uses it for more than that. The part that throws me off is she’ll make big purchases for the apartment with her grandmas credit card and try to make me pay her “half”. This is something that not only will I not do, but can’t do. I don’t work while I’m in school, which is something I’m a little ashamed about, but I do not have any interest in giving her a hefty amount of money for a purchase she didn’t make, knowing it would go straight into her pocket. 

She also had an idea to get a cat for the apartment. To be clear, I supported the idea but I was clear that it was her cat so not my responsibility. She has said on multiple occasions she will get the cat fixed if I can help out. As much as I want this cat fixed so she stops peeing on everything and staining my clothes, this is something I absolutely refuse to concede to. Not my cat, not my financial responsibility. However, I do frequently watch her cat when she’s away for weekends, which is every weekend. This is something that is not as pressing but it’s frustrating that she just assumes I will stay home all weekend so I can take care of HER cats. She also just recently washed that cat for the first time. She’s about to be 2. I feel like I take better care of her cat and spend more time with her. 

I think I just wanted to get all this out because I haven’t known who to go to about this. Me constantly putting what I want or need aside for her is really started to take a toll, but I don’t know how to not do that without feeling guilty or anxious of how she will treat me. Our parents are best friends so if this goes south, it will be really weird for them, which I don’t want. I haven’t brought any of my frustrations up with her because I have a feeling she won’t be receptive, plus I don’t want our parents involved, and I’m afraid of confrontation. In my mind, it’s best to just suffer through the next year until the lease is up. But, does anyone have any advice or suggestions on what to do about this?

1kyy6i3,https://i.redd.it/z7g5k03bgv3f1.jpeg,What’s a fair rate for a 30-second explainer video?,"EVER wonder what the real cost is for a 30-second explainer video? You know — those bite-sized mini-movies that explain your whole business while you sip coffee? Yeah, those! Spoiler alert: it’s not just the coffee that’s expensive.



Step 1: The “What’s the Price?” 

So, you walk into a video studio and ask, “Hey, how much for a 30-second explainer video?” And suddenly, it’s like you just asked for a spaceship launch price quote. “Well... it depends.”

Depends on what? The coffee? The snacks? The animator’s mood?


---

Step 2: The Components of Chaos

Let’s break down the madness:

Scriptwriting: Someone’s gotta explain what you do without sounding like a robot. That’s an art.

Voiceover: The soothing or dramatic voice that makes your product sound cooler than sliced bread.

Animation: Where magic meets hours of clicking and tweaking pixels.

Sound Design: Because silence is awkward.

Revisions: When you say “make it pop!” and the animator asks “How much pop do you want, exactly?”


Each of these can cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000. Multiply that by the number of people involved, and suddenly you’re wondering if you can pay in installments.


---

Step 3: Market Reality Check 💸

On average, a decent 30-second explainer video can run anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000. Yes, that’s a big range! But quality animation ain’t cheap — and you get what you pay for.

$1,000? You get a basic video with limited animation and maybe a cat who doesn’t quite move like a cat.

$5,000? You get Oscar-worthy storytelling, slick animations, and a voiceover that makes Morgan Freeman jealous.



---

Step 4: DIY or Professional? The Eternal Debate 🤔

If you want to save money, you could try DIY tools. Spoiler: your dog might still be more expressive than your animations.

On the flip side, pros bring creativity, polish, and the “wow factor.” Plus, they deal with tech headaches so you don’t have to.


---

Final Punchline: Is It Worth It? 🤷‍♂️

If your 30-second explainer video helps you land even one big client or explains your product so well your mom finally gets it — then yes, it’s worth every penny.

And if not, hey, at least you have a funny video to show at parties!


---

So next time someone asks, “What’s a fair rate for a 30-second explainer video?” you can say, “Fair? Fair is whatever gets you the popcorn-worthy story you deserve.”

I'm a trans man, and there’s this one millennial coworker of mine who’s just so gleefully ignorant, and today really pushed me.

During lunch, she was chatting with another coworker (the kind who does the whole “I’m not transphobic but…” routine), and of course they brought up the JK Rowling nonsense — how she’s doubling down and now literally sponsoring efforts to strip away our rights. They were talking about it like it was some quirky celebrity feud or gossip, like it didn’t directly impact people like me who are just trying to live our damn lives.

Then, as I walked past to get some coffee, she *smirked* and said something like, *“Well maybe it’s not too late for you to stop this nonsense and go back to who you actually are!”* Like I’m some confused teen trying on eyeliner for the first time, not a grown-ass adult who’s fought tooth and nail just to exist as myself.

I wanted to slap her. Right there. And I’m not proud of the anger that surged up in me, but I’m also not going to gaslight myself out of feeling it. That wasn’t the first transphobic thing she’s said. Not by a long shot. I’ve tolerated microaggressions and smug little “jokes” from her before, but this one felt personal in a way that just broke something in me.

And the worst part? I can’t even report her. Where I work, unless someone’s being *explicitly* violent or using slurs, HR just shrugs it off. “Different perspectives” and all that BS.

So yeah. I’m stuck tolerating her, for now. But I swear, every day it chips away at my sanity a little more. I just wanted to come here, where I know at least some people will understand.",12,1748590160.0,trans,7,1.0,False

• Knowing something doesn't mean you'll act on it

• Knowledge without action is just information

• Real change happens when you COMMIT, not just understand



**🚨 Lesson 2: Control Your Inputs**

• What you consume mentally

• What media you absorb

• Who you spend time with



**💡 Lesson 3: Focus on Gains, Not Losses**

✔️ More energy

1kyy4q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1kyy4q4/when_love_turns_dangerous_novel_the_rainy_season/,"""When Love Turns Dangerous Novel""- The rainy season had begun.","Chapter 1

The rainy season had begun. Heavy raindrops struck the dry ground, and the small clouds of dust they raised disappeared as the rain grew stronger.

Tara Thayer held the last of the bedding covers tightly as she rushed through the downpour toward the villa. The sudden storm had given her no time to grab an umbrella.

Instead, she sprinted outside to rescue the sheets she had left drying in the open. Now, with the bedding safely inside, her clothes and hair were damp from the rain.

She looked out at the relentless rain and exhaled slowly. Even now, she could hardly believe what had happened—that she had somehow crossed into another world.

Only the day before, she had transmigrated into the villainess' body—a character from a story revolving around a pampered female lead. By the time she arrived, the original owner of the body had already died of a sudden illness in her room.

In this book, the female lead worked as a live-in housekeeper for a famous boy band. Her warmth and kindness gradually healed the four members, making her their beloved favorite.

The villainess held the same job, but her reputation couldn't have been more different. She'd shamelessly flirted with the boy band members, earning their utter disdain.

Later, consumed by jealousy over the female lead's bond with the men, the villainess repeatedly tried to sabotage her. Instead of succeeding, she only made the men more sympathetic toward the female lead.

In the end, they expelled the villainess from the villa. When her schemes were exposed, she became a hated figure, scorned by everyone.

Tara wanted to leave right then and there—to get away from the boy band and the female lead. But the original host's contract still had six months left, and she couldn't quit until then.

Breaking the contract early meant paying a massive penalty, and the original host hadn't been wealthy enough to afford it.

Tara was usually laid-back, but the thought of paying that fine made her think that she'd rather die again than deal with it. Left with no other option, she decided to keep the job.

She avoided the privileged boy band, limited her interactions with the female lead, and spoke only when necessary. If she remained cautious, she might just make it through these six months in one piece.

Heavy rain poured over the garden, the fierce wind driving slanted sheets of water. Despite it being midday, the sky was so dark that it seemed ready to split with lightning.

Footsteps approached from behind Tara. When she turned, she spotted a young woman in the same uniform gathering the bedding and walking past her into the villa without so much as a glance. It was as if speaking to her were a complete waste of time.

Tara knew that everyone in the villa disliked the original owner of this body. She gave the young woman's retreating figure a brief, indifferent look before examining her own damp uniform.

The black and white fabric was half-transparent where it clung to her fair skin. Her exposed legs looked softly luminous in the dim light.

Tara adjusted the wet hem of her skirt. She'd have to go back to her room and change. She couldn't work like this, soaked to the skin.

She had taken just a few steps toward the right side of the first floor when hurried footsteps sounded from the entrance.

Gemma Wolpert, the manager, called out sharply, ""Tara, come help.""

Without waiting for a reply, Gemma turned and rushed back outside, her face and movements tense with urgency. Tara reluctantly followed Gemma, her uniform still uncomfortably damp.

Outside, the earlier downpour had lightened to a drizzle. The villa's garden, vibrant and rain-soaked, looked almost dreamy in the mist, but Tara had no time to appreciate it.

A luxury van was parked at the entrance. Gemma pulled the door open, and two assistants stepped out, their expressions strained as they struggled to support a tall, drunken man between them.

Even together, they could barely keep his unsteady, six-foot-two-inch frame upright. Gemma grew visibly impatient as she watched the assistants falter.

""Stop standing around. Help us get Lance to his room,"" she ordered, gesturing for Tara to step in.

Tara didn't want to touch Lance Swain, but at that moment, she had no choice but to help carry him inside. When she saw the others holding Lance by the arms, she stepped behind him. Her hands hesitated as she wondered how she was meant to help in that situation.

Lance frowned, his handsome face tense with annoyance as he tried to push them away. But his drunken body swayed, forcing him backward.

Just as Tara moved to guide him from behind, he stumbled back. She quickly pressed her hands against the firm muscles of his lower back to stop him from falling onto her.

The warmth of her touch seeped through the thin fabric, brushing his sensitive waist. Lance lowered his head, a quiet groan escaping his lips. The others, too focused on keeping him upright, didn't notice.

Tara didn't hear it either. Still feeling uncomfortable, she nudged him forward. Fortunately, they managed to get him into the room on the second floor without any trouble.

Gemma released her hold and wiped the cold sweat from her forehead. They couldn't let Lance fall. How would she ever face the Swain family if he got hurt?

""Alright. One person should stay and watch over him,"" Gemma told Tara, who was still breathing heavily.

Tara looked confused. She was catching her breath, silently complaining about how Lance, though he appeared lean, was actually tall and solid. Carrying him up the stairs had been exhausting.

""Me?"" She pointed at herself, surprised.

The two assistants walked out of the room without question. Then, Gemma remembered something. Someone had mentioned to her recently that Tara might be ""a little too forward"".

Gemma hesitated before saying, ""You shouldn't handle this alone. Get Stella to help you.""

She was certain that nothing inappropriate would happen with two housekeepers present.

Tara agreed without argument. She texted Stella Lyttle, the female lead, requesting her to come to the second floor.

As for herself, Tara needed to find time to go downstairs and change into a fresh uniform. Her current one was damp, and it was making her miserable.

Gemma observed Tara, initially considering whether to fire her. But now, when she observed that Tara had shown no signs of any hidden interest in Lance, she hesitated.

Earlier, when Gemma had told Tara to take care of Lance, Tara had reacted with surprise. And when Gemma changed her instructions and told Tara to call Stella instead, Tara didn't appear disappointed at all. She quickly agreed, as though she wanted to avoid any delay.

Gemma frowned, confused, then decided to let it go for now. Hiring live-in housekeepers required thorough vetting, and with one recently dismissed and no replacement yet, she couldn't afford to lose another. She would need to revisit the issue later.

Soon, Gemma and the two assistants left, leaving only Tara and Lance, who was now lying on the couch in the room.

Tara's gaze drifted to Lance, who was stretched out on his back with his shirt slightly undone. His right leg rested on the couch while the other dangled off the edge.

His hair was a little messy, but it only added to his appeal, lending him a relaxed, seductive air. For a few seconds, her mind went blank.

Meanwhile, Lance creased his brow and slowly turned over on the couch.

Earlier, when the group had helped Lance inside, someone must have bumped into the coffee table in front of the couch. If Lance rolled off, he would likely hit his head on it.

Tara felt a jolt of alarm. She immediately pushed the coffee table away, its legs screeching against the floor, and grabbed Lance just before he could fall.

Before she could even marvel at her quick reflexes, Lance's hand closed around her wrist, pulling her down with him. She lost her balance and landed on the floor beneath him, his body pressing against hers as the subtle spice of his cologne filled her senses.

Her vision blurred momentarily, the impact driving the breath from her lungs. Then, she felt Lance's exhale, warm against her neck, sending a rush of heat over her skin.

Tara's neck and ears were unbearably sensitive. She shoved against him, but his weight held her firmly in place, solid and unyielding.

""Lance… get up. You're suffocating me,"" she gasped.

But no matter how hard she pushed, he didn't move. It was as if he'd already sunk into a drunken sleep.

Chapter 2

Tara kept trying to push Lance away, but her arms were trapped under his weight. She shoved with all her might, but he didn't budge. She wasn't strong enough to free herself.

No matter how hard she tried, nothing worked. His warm breath brushed against her neck, and her heart raced uncontrollably. She didn't know what to do.

Then, the door swung open. Stella walked in and stopped dead. There was Lance, his tall frame pinning Tara to the floor by the couch, completely still. Stella stood there, stunned.

""You two—"" Her voice faltered as she spoke, and her expression was filled with hurt.

Lance was the guy she'd been crushing on, and the sight of this scene before her felt like a knife through her heart.

Still trapped beneath Lance, Tara heard the door open and Stella's voice. Relief washed over her, and she quickly raised her voice in desperation.

""Q-Quick! Help me get him off. I can't breathe!""

Although Tara couldn't see Stella's expression, she pleaded urgently. Her urgency wasn't just because of the lack of air. His weight pressed heavily on her chest, making it ache.

She figured that Lance must have been completely drunk as he was lying on top of her with the full weight of his body.

Stella snapped out of her daze and rushed over to help. After some struggle, they finally managed to push Lance aside. Tara scrambled out from under him, gasping for breath, her limbs prickling from the weight that had trapped her for so long.

""Thank you,"" Tara said.

Stella looked at Tara, whose hair and clothes were slightly disheveled. Yet, the latter still looked effortlessly beautiful. Her striking, radiant features were the kind that made people stare.

Even though nothing had actually happened between Tara and Lance, Stella couldn't shake the unease tightening in her chest.

""You're welcome,"" Stella answered, her smile faint.

Tara smiled back tiredly. She was completely drained after helping Lance up the stairs, getting trapped under him, and using all her strength to push him away.

She glanced at him, still unconscious on the couch. She decided that he could just stay there as she didn't want to risk waking him again.

""Stella, my clothes are wet. I'm going downstairs to change,"" Tara said.

She didn't need to check her reflection to know she looked disheveled.

Stella stepped out of the bathroom holding a basin of water and nodded. ""Go change, then come back up.""

Tara nodded. ""Thanks for taking care of things here.""

Stella smiled. However, whether Tara was heading downstairs to change, Stella had no intention of letting her near Lance again.

Tara didn't dwell on it. She smoothed her wrinkled uniform and decided that it would have to do for now as she left the room. She had no interest in befriending Stella, so staying polite would suffice.

The door shut quietly behind Tara. As she reached the stairwell, she stopped halfway when footsteps echoed from below.

Glancing down, she spotted Soren Farrell in casual workout clothes, his sports headphones draped around his neck. His handsome features held an easy confidence, lending him an air of charm and mischief.

His sharp gaze swept over her in silent appraisal when he noticed her. Tara's uniform was slightly rumpled, the damp patches from earlier still clinging to her skin.

The standard black-and-white dress the housekeepers typically wore fell just above the knee, looking modest on most. But her tall frame made the skirt appear shorter, ending mid-thigh.

Tara was used to remarks about her curves getting more attention than her smarts. The uniform clung to her in a way that made her stand out.

Now, her hair was disheveled, her striking face flushed with surprise. The damp fabric hugged her body, accentuating every curve.

A faint blush still colored her neck where Lance's breath had warmed her skin, leaving an unsettling blend of innocence and allure.

Soren's gaze lingered on her as he kept climbing the stairs. Tara hadn't thought that she'd run into him. She hesitated, then shifted to the side to make way.

He walked past her and was about to continue down the hall but stopped. With a slight turn, he faced her, his demeanor aloof and detached. Now, the distance between them was close.

Soren skimmed over her once more before he asked, ""You're the one who upset Jonah the other day, aren't you?""

He'd heard about a housekeeper who brought Jonah Pearson coffee the day before yesterday, then blatantly tried to flirt with him in his room. Jonah had been so annoyed that he'd made her leave.

Remembering the original host's past, Tara understood exactly what Soren was talking about. She gave an awkward nod of acknowledgment. Even as she bowed her head in embarrassment, her beauty was breathtaking.

Soren stood silently, watching her for a long moment before turning away with a quiet scoff as if her efforts to charm Jonah were beneath him.

Tara didn't care about his mockery or his disdain. Soren was just one of the villa's owners. He was nothing more to her. So, what he thought of her didn't matter.

As his figure retreated into the distance, she descended the stairs. She felt uncomfortable in her uniform and needed to get back to her room to change as soon as possible.

Working as a housekeeper here had its advantages. Each live-in housekeeper had their own room, and the pay was generous.

But because the members of the famous boy band didn't want too many live-in housekeepers, only a few were employed. One had even been let go just a few days earlier.

Aside from the live-in housekeepers, other housekeepers would come in to work but would never stay overnight, leaving once their tasks were finished.

Tara hurried downstairs to her room and closed the door behind her. When she walked past the mirror, she paused and turned to study her reflection.

The reflection staring back at her had a slender build, her hair and clothes disheveled but somehow still lovely. She adjusted her skirt. Fortunately, the uniform had inner shorts to prevent accidents. Otherwise, she wouldn't have known how to handle her tasks.

She snatched a clean uniform set and changed, a dull throb pulsing in her temples. Ten minutes later, she stepped out, knowing that she couldn't linger. Then, she rushed back upstairs to Lance's room.

Stella was still cleaning Lance's hands and neck when she heard the door open and close. Her expression darkened.

Tara moved closer without saying a single word. When she saw Stella tending to Lance, she bent down, picked up the basin of warm water, and carried it to the bathroom. She poured it out and refilled it with fresh, warm water.

Stella's expression softened slightly when Tara placed the basin back beside her. Tara didn't notice the change in Stella's expression at all. She just figured that it was time for a fresh basin of warm water.

Even so, she could tell that Stella disliked her being near Lance. The way Stella stiffened when Tara wiped his hands was pretty hard to ignore.

Acting like she hadn't caught onto Stella's defensiveness, Tara plopped down on the couch with nothing to do. She couldn't leave yet since Gemma had asked her and Stella to stay and care for Lance.

Stella was almost done cleaning Lance's hands and neck. With nothing else to do, Tara waited. When Stella finished, Tara quietly took the basin and walked into the bathroom, slowly putting things away.

She wasn't usually slow with her work. She was deliberately taking her time. She didn't feel any need to rush as she had nothing left to do but to watch over Lance.

Tara left the bathroom and returned to her seat. Across from her, Stella ignored her completely. Instead, she kept looking at Lance with soft eyes, occasionally reaching over to fix his hair.

Tara watched the scene, which seemed to glow with quiet affection.

She remembered the original story of the novel—Stella had a crush on Lance and always looked after him, just like she did with the other three guys in the band. That was how she'd managed to win over all four members of the famous boy group.

Resting her chin in her hand, Tara silently observed Stella's tender care toward Lance. Outside, birds and cicadas chirped now and then. The sunlight was harsh, but the room felt cold and silent.

Before long, Tara's eyelids grew heavy. After struggling to stay awake, she sank into the couch and fell fast asleep.

Chapter 3

The evening sunlight seeped through the curtains, illuminating the couch where Lance lay. He slowly opened his eyes, his forehead creased in discomfort.

As he lifted his hand to rub his throbbing temple, his gaze landed on the couch across from him, and he went completely still.

Tara lay there, half-reclined in serene sleep. Even in rest, her beauty was undeniable, her delicate features as captivating as ever. Her work uniform clung to her figure, accentuating every graceful curve.

It was impossible not to stare. Lance's eyes lingered on her long, slender legs. They seemed so soft that they seemed like they might turn red at the slightest pressure.

His expression grew solemn, his thoughts unreadable.

Beside him, Stella stirred and woke. She became fully alert when she saw Lance's open eyes.

""Mr. Swain, you're awake?"" she asked, her voice soft.

Lance shifted his attention from Tara, his voice coming out rough. ""Yeah. Did Gemma send you two to keep an eye on me?""

As he spoke, Tara woke up, rubbing her eyes. Still groggy, she watched Lance check his watch.

Stella studied Tara, whose beauty gave her an almost radiant glow, and felt a flicker of irritation. But then she remembered Tara's abrasive personality, and her worry faded.

""Gemma assigned us to stay with you—for your safety,"" Stella said as she poured a glass of water for Lance.

Tara made no move to help. She thought rushing to pour the water would've seemed like she was just trying to curry favor with Lance, which wasn't necessary.

After all, this moment was meant to be a heartfelt exchange between the female lead and the four male leads. As the story's villainess, Tara had no place to intrude.

So she remained where she was, acting as a passive observer in the background.

While pouring the water, Stella stole another glance at Tara. Usually, Tara would be the first to jump in, eager to prove herself in front of the men.

Stella had braced for her to interfere and was even prepared to have the glass taken from her hands, but this time, Tara didn't move. She simply sat across the room, suppressing a yawn, showing no interest in participating.

Lance followed Stella's glance and turned his attention back to Tara.

She had just stifled a yawn behind her hand when she noticed them both staring at her. Her drowsy eyes darted between them, a faint hint of confusion flashing across her face.

She wondered if yawning was against the rules and thought that it seemed too ridiculous to be an actual policy.

Lance studied her carefully. He remembered how she used to strike deliberate poses in front of him, her words playful and loaded with innuendos.

But now, her gaze held nothing but utter, almost naive innocence—so much so that it made him scowl. He didn't know what kind of reverse psychology tactic she was employing.

""Leave,"" Lance said coldly to Tara.

The room went silent. Stella didn't dare make a sound. She glanced at Lance, then at Tara, her satisfaction barely hidden. She expected Tara to be mortified—maybe even to burst into tears.

Instead, Tara rose immediately, showing no offense or distress. If anything, she seemed almost eager to leave.

""Right away, Mr. Swain,"" she replied briskly.

Under Lance's and Stella's watchful gazes, Tara left the room without a second thought.

The moment the door clicked shut behind her, she let out a heavy sigh, grateful to escape Lance's oppressive presence, where every move had made her feel like she was under scrutiny.

Feeling lighter, she hurried down the stairs. The housekeepers had already finished for the day, leaving the villa quiet as night settled in.

Tara still had work to do, so she couldn't head back to her room just yet. If Terence Oakley, the butler, noticed, he would dock her wages.

Meanwhile, only Lance and Stella remained in his room upstairs. Stella was too shy to look him in the eye.

Lance rubbed his forehead, saying, ""You can go, too. I don't need anyone watching over me.""

His tone with Stella was noticeably warmer than it had been with Tara. Ever poised, Stella nodded.

Before stepping out, she said, ""Please call me if you aren't feeling well, Mr. Swain. I'd... worry otherwise.""

She glanced at him hesitantly, unsure if she'd overstepped.

Lance leaned back against the couch. He shut his eyes as he quietly hummed.

Stella, pleased with herself, had just turned to leave when his low, rough voice stopped her. ""Did I end up on top of you when I passed out drunk?""

Her chest tightened. The scene from when she first entered the room replayed in her mind—Tara had struggled beneath him as she frantically called out for help. Her voice still seemed to ring in Stella's ears.

Almost reflexively, Stella nodded. ""I'm alright, Mr. Swain. Please don't concern yourself.""

Lance didn't doubt her. ""I'll compensate you.""

Stella's heart leapt, but she didn't dare show any interest in whatever compensation he meant. The truth was, she couldn't accept any repayment at all, terrified that Lance might discover she hadn't actually been the one involved in the incident.

""That's unnecessary, really,"" she insisted, aware that stepping back was the way to move forward.

She knew that it was the surest way to make Lance take notice. After this, she was certain she would hold a special place in his thoughts. The mere idea of it filled her with excitement.

Lance dismissed her refusal. His decision seemed final. As for whether Stella's considerate act had moved him? That remained a mystery.

Downstairs, Tara had no idea what was happening in Lance's room above her. She had just finished cutting the fruit, dividing it into four portions, and arranging them neatly on a platter.

She had to remember which fruits each of the four men disliked and which they preferred, adding more of their favorites and omitting the ones they avoided.

The high salary didn't come without effort, and being a housekeeper was far from easy. With a quiet sigh, Tara placed the four servings of fruit in the refrigerator to chill, intending to deliver them to their rooms later.

A soft thud echoed as she carefully shut the door of the expensive refrigerator. It was a high-end model, and she couldn't afford to be careless. If it broke, she'd never have the money to repair it.

Tara was about to turn back to the bar counter to clean up when she spotted the young woman from earlier—the one she'd seen while collecting laundry at noon—standing behind her with an icy, unwelcoming stare.

Tara looked at her briefly, then dismissed her. She walked back to the bar counter, turned on the faucet, and started washing the cutting board and fruit knife as if no one else were there.

This was the first time she had ever ignored Leah Zeller. At that point, it had always been Leah who acted superior, while Tara buttered her up, fishing for details about the four men or trying to gain their favor.

Leah was certain that Tara would try something when she delivered the fruit platters that night. She'd already managed to rattle Jonah just two days ago. Who knew what she'd pull this time?

Nevertheless, Leah had no intention of stepping in. If anything, she hoped Gemma would fire Tara, too.

""Mr. Oakley said that I'll be delivering Mr. Pearson's fruit platter tonight,"" Leah announced, her voice and posture dripping with condescension, her disdain for Tara plain as day.

The running water didn't drown out the edge in her tone, but Tara kept washing the cutting board without missing a beat. She didn't look up, her reply utterly indifferent.

""Okay,"" she said.

Leah had expected Tara to fawn over her as usual, pleading to handle the fruit deliveries herself. She stood waiting, but after that single indifferent response, Tara said nothing more.

When Tara finished wiping down the counter, Leah still hadn't moved, rooted in place as she stared. Tara couldn't fathom why Leah was simply standing there gawking at her. As she walked past, she shot Leah a puzzled glance before continuing on her way.

Leah watched her go, completely thrown. She was surprised that Tara hadn't fought for that night's assignment. She wondered if Tara had changed to a new approach to win the men over.

Tara left the kitchen and headed straight for the staff dining area. Dinner service would start soon, and she wanted to eat before the rush.

She grabbed one of the prepped staff meals from the fridge. The chef had left them there before clocking out. Peeling off the plastic wrap, she popped it into the microwave.

Within minutes, a savory aroma wafted through the air. Satisfied, Tara pulled out the steaming meal and settled in to eat.

These past two days, along with the generous pay, the quality of the staff meals had been her most pleasant surprise. The chef's cooking was restaurant-quality, and the food had won her over.

Chapter 4

Tara was enjoying her meal when someone entered through the door. Stella didn't look surprised to find Tara there.

Leah remained puzzled by Tara's recent behavior. After spotting Stella in the staff dining area, she smiled warmly and went over to talk to her.

""Stella, are you done with your work?"" Leah asked.

Stella turned and smiled. ""Mr. Swain didn't want me to go hungry, so he told me to come down and eat first.""

She glanced briefly at Tara, who was quietly finishing her meal.

Leah was clearly closer to Stella, and the latter held more influence with the four men.

So, she quickly offered some flattery. ""Mr. Swain is so good to you, Stella. He's not like that with me… or Tara. The guys always seem to look down on us.""

""If you truly care about them, they'll see your sincerity in time,"" Stella said, reassuring her.

Leah nodded eagerly, taking the words to heart. ""Thanks, Stella. I'll do everything I can to win their trust.""

Stella offered her a gentle smile and walked to the refrigerator. She threw Tara a pointed glance from across the dining table as she did.

It was apparent that her earlier remarks hadn't been directed only at Leah. They were also a quiet boast to Tara about how the men treated her with favor.

Tara focused on her meal, but she'd heard every word. Tara knew exactly what Stella meant—the men doted on her while giving Tara the bare minimum.

As for earning the men's trust? Tara wanted nothing to do with that. After all, she was just a housekeeper in this villa. The moment her contract ended, she'd leave without a second thought. What good was their trust to her?

But everyone had their own way. Her path was different from Stella's or Leah's.

The food was delicious. In no time, she'd already eaten half of it. Nearby, the scrape of chair legs against the floor broke the silence.

Stella and Leah had settled near her, talking between themselves without including Tara in their conversation. Tara was used to keeping to herself, so she didn't take it personally. People naturally talked to whomever they felt closest to.

Once she finished eating, she got up and made her way to the kitchen at a leisurely pace to wash her dishes.

Leah had no intention of washing hers and hoped Tara would do it instead. But she couldn't bring herself to ask outright since Tara had always offered before.

By the time Leah walked into the kitchen with her greasy plates and utensils, Tara had already cleaned up and put everything in the dishwasher. She gave Leah a blank look, then grabbed a couple of paper towels to dry her hands.

Leah had been standing there for half a minute, and Tara still made no move to help with the dishes.

""Tara, do you want to know if Mr. Wilhelm has a girlfriend?"" Leah asked.

Tara had just tossed the paper towels into the trash. She turned to look at Leah, confused.

""No, I don't.""

Why would she care whether Shawn Wilhelm was dating someone? She thought it was a strange question.

Leah was caught off guard by Tara's blunt response. She had no idea how to continue. Tara had always been curious about the men's romantic lives. Now, she was claiming that she didn't care.

She wondered if Tara was truly indifferent or just pretending.

""If you wash my dishes, I'll put in a good word for you with Mr. Pearson tonight. Maybe he'll even let you into his room tomorrow night.""

Leah was sure that Tara would take the dishes after hearing that, so she held them out with a haughty expression. Naturally, she was lying. Jonah disliked Tara far too much, and Leah would never actually stand up for her.

Tara glanced at the plates and utensils in Leah's hands. She suddenly realized why Leah had asked that odd question. It was just to get out of doing the dishes.

""Don't bother with it,"" she said without missing a beat.

Then, she walked past Leah and left the kitchen.

Leah was stunned. She couldn't believe that Tara had actually refused. Just two days ago, she'd been trying to win Jonah over. Did she not care now?

Stella walked into the kitchen and found Leah still holding the dishes, standing motionless as she stared at the doorway.

""What's wrong?"" Stella asked.

Leah finally snapped out of her thoughts, her expression uneasy as she asked, ""Stella, doesn't Tara seem quieter than usual today?""

Tara had never been loud, but she often slipped away for short stretches, only to return reeking of perfume and caked in heavy makeup. She never let anyone see her bare-faced.

Yet, there was no trace of her usual overpowering scent that day. Her face was natural and stunningly beautiful, like a freshly bloomed flower. It was an almost otherworldly kind of beauty.

Leah had always known that Tara was pretty but had never realized how much her usual makeup had concealed.

That thick foundation had muted her features, and those harsh, overdrawn eyeliners looked almost ridiculous up close. Still, even the worst makeup couldn't hide the fact that Tara was naturally striking.

Stella didn't notice anything unusual about Tara. ""She's probably just worried that Gemma will fire her.""

She knew that Gemma would let go of Tara eventually if she kept acting out. So, she figured that lying low was a smart move.

""But…""

Leah hesitated. She and Stella were on good terms but not close enough to speak freely. Seeing Stella still waiting for her to continue, Leah dropped the subject.

She nearly asked if Tara had switched up her flirting tactics, but if Stella told Gemma she was gossiping, she knew that she'd get scolded.

""I'm probably overthinking it,"" Leah said, shrugging it off.

Stella offered a kind smile and unexpectedly brought up the incident from two nights ago. ""About what happened with Mr. Pearson that night, I don't think Tara intended to provoke him.""

""Stella, stop making excuses for Tara. She was obviously throwing herself at Mr. Pearson. She's a lot more cunning than she looks. Don't let that innocent face fool you.""

Leah found Stella's trust misplaced. Tara's advances had been blatant, yet Stella kept defending her.

When Stella opened her mouth to say more in Tara's defense, Leah cut in, convinced that the former had fallen for Tara's sweet-girl act. ""She's the type who uses her looks to get what she wants. You'd better be careful, Stella, or Mr. Swain could be next.""

Leah dropped her voice to a murmur when mentioning Lance's name, making sure that no one else would catch wind of Stella's feelings for him.

Although Stella was certain that Lance would never give someone like Tara a second glance, she furrowed her brow in feigned concern.

""I really don't think that Tara is that kind of person—""

Leah's patience wore thin, and she said bluntly, ""Stella, you're too kind. I'll keep an eye on Mr. Swain and make sure Tara doesn't get any ideas about him.""

This way, she could protect Stella's interests while earning her gratitude.

Stella hesitated, her words faltering, but she never actually refused Leah's suggestion. Taking this as agreement, Leah pulled her into helping with the dishes, playing the role of the attentive friend.

The night grew darker. That night was Tara's turn to deliver fruit to the four men's rooms.

Soon after, Tara wheeled the serving cart into the elevator. Leah followed her inside, as she was responsible for bringing Jonah his fruit.

Neither of them spoke in the elevator. Tara intended to stay only until her contract expired, after which she would completely cut ties with everyone in this villa. To her, Leah was just another coworker.

She had no interest in forming any kind of connection, not even a casual one. Although Tara wasn't the most perceptive, she could still tell that Leah disliked her.

Leah kept glancing at Tara in puzzlement. But Tara never returned her gaze, not even when she stepped out of the elevator with the cart.

This annoyed Leah, who thought that Tara was putting on airs and up to some new trick.

""Tara, come with me to Mr. Pearson's room first,"" she said.

Leah was sure that this was the moment Tara had been waiting for. After all, everyone in the villa knew how hard she'd been trying to win Jonah's heart.

But Tara had no intention of following Leah. At the latter's words, she let go of the cart.

""You take it. I'll deliver this to Mr. Wilhelm first.""

Picking up a fruit platter, Tara turned and strode down the right hallway. The second floor was spacious. The rooms on the right belonged to Jonah and Shawn, while Lance's and Soren's were on the left.

Chapter 5

Leah's face registered surprise as she watched Tara pick up the fruit platter and stop at Shawn's door. She didn't know what Tara was thinking and wondered if the latter was interested in someone new now.

Without so much as a glance at Leah, Tara knocked lightly on Shawn's door.

After a brief pause, Shawn's voice came from inside, sounding polite and warm. ""Come in.""

Tara turned the doorknob. Only then did Leah wheel the serving cart away, her questioning gaze fixed on Tara.

When Tara opened the door, the bedroom's cool-toned decor and faint lighting gave her an immediate sense of heaviness.

Shawn sat on the couch in loungewear, his tall frame relaxed yet poised with an elegance that naturally drew attention. When he heard the door open, he looked up.

The subdued light seemed to wrap around Tara as she entered, casting a soft glow over her. Her extraordinary beauty and alluring curves became more apparent under his gaze.

His expression remained neutral, but the assessment in his eyes turned to recognition. He had clearly remembered that she was the housekeeper who had upset Jonah.

Shawn didn't avert his eyes as Tara approached. His gaze remained composed, though he noted that her looks alone could easily ensnare attention.

Tara sensed his evaluating stare but showed no sign of discomfort. She placed the fruit platter on the coffee table.

""Enjoy, Mr. Wilhelm,"" she said, then turned and left without hesitation.

Shawn remained silent even as she gently closed the door behind her.

As soon as the door shut, Tara looked to the right and saw Leah emerging from Jonah's room in a hurry, her face tense with alarm.

Tara didn't approach. She simply waited, observing as Leah pushed the serving cart toward her.

When Leah reached Tara, bitter resentment surged through her. If Tara hadn't flirted with Jonah, he wouldn't be treating Leah with such cold indifference now. His cutting stares had almost left her frozen in place.

Even delivering a simple fruit platter had left Leah unsettled. His harsh expression had nearly brought her to tears.

""Take it,"" Leah snapped as she shoved the cart toward Tara with rough impatience, her disdain unmistakable.

Tara barely glanced at her, unfazed by her tone. She then turned and wheeled the cart down the left hallway without saying a single word.

The sooner she finished, the sooner she could rest. She thought that arguing with Leah was pointless. It would just waste time and sour her already indifferent mood.

Leah had expected Tara to snap back, but the latter only rolled her eyes and walked away. Tara's lack of reaction stoked Leah's anger, leaving her frustrated and stifled.",1,1748589945.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1kyy0po,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1kyy0po/craziest_roommate_ever/,Craziest roommate ever,"So 2 years back I used to live with this two roommates let's call them Anne (F31) and Danny( F23) this dates back to 2023, so I live away from home 18F and I'm Indian don't literally have any money and living off my parents money. They literally give me monthly allowance for university needs and personal needs. So let's get back to the topic, I used to share 2BHK with them and they were senior n toom the bedrooms where while finalizing the house we had decided that Danny would take the hall as she was comfortable  and needed no privacy ( first red flag) meanwhile I was living in a single room all by myself, which was in the top most floor, basically terrace of the building  but the heat here is too harsh that I was unable to live in that building so that the new house we were looking for was in the ground floor and didn't needed AC, and fan would have worked. So I reluctantly agreed to live off in hall with Anne and Danny. 
So I moved with them everything was going okay okay, not so good bc my exams were on for 1 semester so didn't basically know how to handle exams and all. So I did not notice anything off, so after some week passed by and exams were over that Anne who was older than us was cooking something and left the pressure cooker in the kitchen gas and went to take bath and told me to watch over, however I was studying and Danny remove the pressure cooker from the gas and put up her things to cook, I Don't remember what she cooked and it was ready in no time, then I'm a great tea and coffee addict, I thought why not make a coffee so I made n kept a cup for Anne as well then put back the pressure  cooker and as soon as Anne came back from the washroom, Danny was like ohh I didn't know what happened, blah blah blah. Then that Anne started shouting and screaming and I couldn't even say a single word as I was the youngest and my mother n father had said that don't fight with anyone out there bc they won't be able to come n protect me and as language was the barrier, how much of English I would have spoken : The real delight in argument is in our own mother tongue. So I didn't argue back n just started crying peacefully. After around an hour or so she came back storming that I didn't apologised to her and blah blah. I did right there and that thing was off...
 So another day comes maybe after a month my mother comes to our room and lives for 3,4 days and takes me back home as it was our semester break, after coming back from home july with almost no contact for 45-50 days, though everything was going to be okay but I brought a small gift for my landlord as she used to visit tenants almost everyday bc she was too friendly and Anne didn't used to like  her at all  bc she used to interrupt but mother being mother used to chat with her and sometimes go to her house upstairs and chat all evenings with tea, I used to go along with her. 
Ps. I didn't used to like the landlord as she was nosy and already was suffering from privacy issues.
But still I used to go there with my mother and one morning she barged in the hall and started screaming like why the fuck you and your mother talking about me but tf we weren't even talking about her. For my mom she was literally invisible and I didn't spoke a single word there as well but my mother did and she barged back to her room and the whole time Danny saw everything but didn't even corrected nor stopped the fight she was just there enjoying. 
 Next instance comes after 3,4 days of that fight my mom left and told me to stay properly n all. Whatever then after 2 months our gas was leaked for something I don't remember we ( Anne and i) weren't talking, I only used to talk with Danny and they didn't told me that gas wasn't working so It was late in night and I didn't know what to do so I borrowed induction from the landlord and cooked my meal and returned the same evening and i couldn't eat outside bc I was tight on money and I used to live in hill with no restaurant around 5kms. Didn't had car or bike so cooked by myself. 
The next morning she barges in the hall and accused me of eavesdropping their words, insulting and talking behind her with our landlord and what not. Ruined my birthday 😐😶
Ps. Everything is falsely accused to me as I used to only talk with my boyfriend that time now ex. And was already broken bc of breakup that time and used to spend time drinking with my friends almost every alternate days, so I used to come  home only to sleep.
And yeahh!! That was the breaking point and I simply left after 3 days of hunting pg and never looked their face. ",0,1748589488.0,iastate,0,0.5,False

Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. **A company in Country A** buys goods from **a supplier in Country B**.
2. Payment is usually made in a global currency (like USD or EUR) through international banks.
3. Banks use systems like **SWIFT** to securely transfer funds between countries.
4. Currency exchange happens if the buyer and seller use different currencies — often through **forex markets**.
5. Central banks monitor these flows, which impact **exchange rates, inflation, and economic policy**.

And many teenagers can't tell their parents and friends about this, to get help. That's. why i decided to share this article i read in forum if you want to read original click [here](https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/tools-for-change-recovery-from-porn-addiction/rebooting-advice-observations-from-successful-rebooters/the-top-3-fatal-mistakes-rebooters-make/)

What I’m going to share with you guys is nothing new. You probably already read it somewhere else. **But it is not given enough importance around here**. People are worrying too much about porn induced ED, dopamine this and dopamine that, testosterone levels, wet dreams, etc. But not enough on how to actually beat this addiction.

This thread is not meant to be motivational. Motivation is temporary. You can watch a Nike football commercial on YouTube, get all pumped up and motivated, and then relapse 4 days later. It means nothing.

This thread is meant to give understanding. It’s meant to give you the final piece of the puzzle needed in order to beat pornography addiction.

I believe, **from the bottom of my heart**, that anyone who understands and applies what I’m going to share here is going succeed quitting porn.

All you have to do is avoid making these 3 mistakes.

Please take your time to **truly absorb** what you’re going to read next. This stuff is not obvious and many men are completely unaware of it, specially those who are new to rebooting. Successful rebooters probably won’t benefit as much from this thread.

Sit down, take your time, and go grab a cup of coffee or tea, as I’m going to share with you the top 3 fatal mistakes a rebooter can make.

**Mistake #1: Using Porn to Stop Feeling Bad**

People who are unaware of this mistake are going to have a very difficult time quitting porn.

This is what usually happens:

You’re very stressed about work or school.  You spent all your day working your ass under pressure and you know that the upcoming days are going to be the same. There’s pain in your body. You’re mentally exhausted. You want to relax and feel good. **So what do you do? Watch porn.**

You go out to have fun one night. There’s one girl you really like, so you try to talk to her, but she keeps ignoring you. One of your more outgoing friends keeps making her laugh with his jokes. You’re jealous. You say to yourself “Fuck this shit” and start approaching other women right there. They all reject you. Even one of them said to you “Get away from me!”. You go back home feeling incredibly frustrated. Your mood is very down. You start to wonder if you’ll ever be able to get a beautiful girlfriend. You get temporarily depressed. It’s painful. You want to escape these feelings. **So what do you do? Watch porn.**

You went out drinking last night. You had a lot of fun, but now you’re left with a terrible hangover. You have a headache, nausea, stomach pain. You can’t concentrate or do anything. You’re just lying there drinking some Gatorade. Obviously, being hungover sucks. You want to stop feeling bad, at least for a few moments. **So what do you do? Watch porn.**

You’re bored as fuck in your house. You and laziness become one. You’re not in the mood for anything, not even watching a movie. Boredom, boredom, and more boredom. Who wants to feel bored? Nobody. Time runs slowly. Nothing is fun. You go to Facebook and there are no interesting updates. You refresh your favorite forums and there are no new replies to your posts. There’s nothing to do. You start becoming anxious and restless. **So what do you do? Watch porn.**

Please, stop this.

**You need to stop medicating yourself with porn every time you feel pain and discomfort.**

This is ignorance to the reality of life.

Stress, depression, frustration, hangovers, boredom, injuries, physical pain, anxiety, embarrassment. You know what they are? You know what they’re called?

They’re called **LIFE**.

Do not run away from life. Do not run away from reality.

We will never become happy if we keep doing this.

In Buddhism this is called aversion. Running away from pain. Running away from discomfort.

All these bad feelings are temporary. Boredom, stress, hangovers, feeling down. They will all pass.

**If we keep taking refuge in porn and running away from pain and discomfort then we will never be able to grow as persons and become real men.**

We need to break out of this cycle. Or at the very least try to.

Otherwise, what are you going to do when things get tough in life? Hide in your room? Become depressed?

What are you going to do when you realize that hitting on girls brings up a lot of anxiety and nervousness? Run away? Make excuses?

What are you going to do when you’re stuck in a traffic jam for 2 hours and you’re hungry as fuck? Complain? Hit the horn endlessly?

What are you going to do when you realize that losing weight isn’t as easy as you thought it would be? Give up? Binge on junk food?

**We need to stop using porn as a pain reliever.**

We need to face reality, not run from it.

Please understand what I’m talking about here. If you do then you will be able to identify every time you’re using porn as an escape.

**Mistake #2: Being Hard On Yourself Every Time You Relapse**

Ok, so you just “relapsed”.

Calm down. Breathe.

Stop the drama. Stop the “_I’m so sick of this_” comments.

Don’t get angry. Don’t feel guilty.

**It won’t do you any good.**

I made this mistake so many times in the past.

Read my journal. I was a “chronic relapser” as others have said.

Here’s what usually happens:

A guy relapses and masturbates to porn. He couldn’t take it anymore and had an hour long porn session. After he’s done, he feels terrible with himself. He comes to the forum and posts on his journal.

“_What a fucking pussy I am_”

“_I can’t believe I gave in, how will I ever beat this?_”

“_I’ve had enough of this shit_”

“_My life is a mess_”

Sometimes he feels angry. Sometimes he feels guilty. Sometimes he feels down. He takes relapse very seriously and ends up feeling very bad with himself. He then goes and commits mistake #1 in order to stop feeling bad, which in turn will make him feel more bad afterwards. So he binges until he’s completely depleted. Then he tries rebooting again, remaining completely unaware of his mistake. Some days later he relapses and once again goes hard on himself, unable to break free of this cycle.

Listen, the next time you relapse, don’t be hard on yourself. Calm down. Open your “relapse spreadsheet” (which I believe everyone should have) and mark the current date with an X. Then calmly get back on track as soon as possible. Minimize your binge as much as you can. You’re not back to zero every time you watch porn.

**There is this damaging belief in the forum that success is measured by how many straight days you go without porn.**

There’s a Hall of Fame, yes, but this is just a way to encourage people. It’s not an indication of whether you’re successful or not.

Please understand. Let’s use some common sense here.

**If a guy goes from watching porn every day to watching porn 3-4 times a month, then he’s already successful.**

Why would a guy like him be so hard on himself every time he relapses? It just doesn’t make any sense. He’s way ahead millions of men around the world who are completely hooked on porn.

All he needs to do is keep trying to reduce the amount of relapses per month. That’s why I believe having a spreadsheet is crucial. It will give him some perspective on how much he has progressed.

With time he will discover that the chaser effect loses its strength. Getting back on track after relapsing gets easier and easier.

He might or might not be able to get into the Hall of Fame, but it doesn’t matter. The addiction no longer has control over him.

That, my friends, is true success.

And the mere fact that you’re a member of this forum and you’re trying to leave porn behind is enough reason to be proud and stop beating yourself up.

**Mistake #3: Focusing Too Much On NOT Watching Porn**

Guess what?

If you’re thinking about not watching porn, you’re thinking about porn.

As long as porn is in your mind, you will have a lot of trouble letting it go.

The correct approach is to just **forget about it**.

Stop obsessing about what day you’re on.

Stop posting on your journal stuff like “_Omg quitting porn is so difficult, the urges are so strong!_”

Stop hanging out too much on this forum.

**Just forget about porn.** Disregard it as an option in your life.

Focus your mind on the stuff that matters. Your family, your dreams, your health, your career.

When urges arise, watch them mindfully. Observe them. Do not react. Do not suppress them. Do not push them away.

Just kindly smile and focus your mind on something else.

Watching porn is not an option. It’s not a part of your life anymore.

It’s a thing of the past.

It was kind of like something out of a movie. My best friend and I decided to crash a school dance — not our school, but a rival one. Her ex goes there, and she wanted him to see what he lost. So she showed up in a stunning dress, makeup done just right, and stood at the edge of the dance floor flirting with other guys, waiting for him to notice. And he did. He pulled her onto the dance floor. Just like she wanted. I was standing by myself, probably looking a little out of place, when this boy walked up to me. Tall. Athletic. Messy, fluffy hair. Football player. Motorcycle rider. The kind of boy who makes the whole hallway go quiet when he walks in. That night, we just… talked. And he looked at me like I was the only girl in the world. Since then — everything moved fast. Maybe too fast. He calls me “his wife,” “his love,” “his world.” And we’ve only been dating for a few weeks. But even before that, he was all in. Sending me paragraphs about how beautiful I am without makeup. Telling me he’d buy me anything. Giving me piggyback rides in the parking lot. Spamming me 30 good morning texts before I even wake up. Bringing me flowers just because. Dancing with me in the kitchen to whatever music is playing from his phone. Kissing my cheek like I might disappear if he doesn’t. One time, I was sitting in the school commons before first period, kind of tired, half awake. He texted me: “Come outside. I have a surprise.” I told him I was already at school. He said, “I know.” I walked outside and there he was — holding my favorite coffee and one of his sweatshirts. He handed me a folded love letter with a note telling me to have the best day ever. All my friends are obsessed with him. I’m not exaggerating. They call him a book boyfriend — like the perfect fictional guy who fell straight out of a Wattpad story. They ask for updates at sleepovers, they freak out over the texts he sends me, they say it’s “relationship goals,” “power couple,” “literally what everyone wants.” They’re all like, “The CEO’s son is in love with you?!”(Yeah — his dad runs a moving company. It’s not huge or anything, but still, he’s technically a CEO, and I guess that makes this whole thing feel even more surreal to them.) He remembered everything I said — even the offhand, “I like spicy food” type comments. Later, I found out he wrote them all down. He has notes on me. Not in a creepy way — just quiet observations. He said he wanted to make sure that if I ever changed, he could change with me. Every few weeks, he has me fill out a form. Like, an actual form. check-ins” every few weeks. It asks questions like “What snack are you craving lately?” or “Are you still into that one show you mentioned?” or “Has your comfort song changed?” I work as a waitress — I also babysit, walk dogs, do little jobs around the neighborhood, really juts little side hustles and chores. But the restaurant is my main job. One day, this random guy came in and started flirting with me. I obviously shut it down. That night, my boyfriend picked me up from my shift, like he always does, and asked how it went. I told him.
He quit his job that night. And the next morning, he told me he got hired at my restaurant. So he could “look out for me.” And now, whenever I’m working and he’s not on shift, he just sits in a booth and watches me like a hawk. One day, this couple came in — probably in their 20s. I’m 16, so way younger. I was taking their order, and the guy tried showing me something on the menu. He was squinting, pointing at it, and I stepped closer to see what he meant. I kind of laughed as I explained the appetizer — it’s like this weird BBQ salad, so it’s hard to describe. Next thing I know, he walks up. Silently puts his hand on my hip. Says, “How’s your shift going, baby?” And kisses me on the cheek. In front of the couple. In front of the other waitresses. In front of everyone. I just stood there frozen. Smiled awkwardly and said it was going fine. The whole room felt like it was watching me. Like, literally, just watches me. Like he can’t take his eyes off me. He tells me it’s because he loves me. That I’m the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen. That he doesn’t want anyone to hurt me. And I know it’s meant to be sweet, but I’m starting to feel like I can’t breathe. He has my pictures saved everywhere — not even pictures of us, just pictures of me. not even pictures of us together, just selfies I’ve sent him ( ones i don’t remember sending to him…and some…maybe i’m paranoid but some i never sent to hol him)  His wallpaper. His widgets. His screen saver. He calls me every morning. Every night. If I don’t answer right away, I’ll get 10 texts, then 20, then 50. Then he panics. Then he apologizes. Like today — I was babysitting. ( one of my regular jobs, i also gave him an update in advance he likes to know
all my activities and i had to make him a calendar so he knew where i was so ik that he knew u was babysitting)  I woke up at 6am, went to the family’s house, and kept my phone on Do Not Disturb so I could focus on the kids. I still had emergency notifications on for the parents and my family, obviously. We had a great day. Drew pictures. Made homemade quicksand. Watched a little Bluey while I made chicken nuggets. Around lunch, I finally checked my phone… and I had 38 missed calls and over 100 texts from him. First he was worried. Then mad. Then apologizing like crazy. I explained. He said, “Oh my God, I messed up. I’m so sorry. So, so sorry.” And he always says sorry. Every time. Every little thing becomes a huge panic. And I just keep thinking… I don’t know if this is what I want. He’s perfect. He really is. I know — everything I described sounds perfect. Dreamy, even. It’s like something out of a book. He really is such a good guy. He’s so into me. He does everything a boyfriend should do. On paper, he’s everything I ever dreamed of — the boy who remembers your coffee order, dances in the kitchen with you, gets along with your little siblings, writes you letters, shows up with sweatshirts and flowers. He’s sweet. And gentle. And obsessed with me. I mean, if you would have told me a year ago that this guy would have been my boyfriend, I would have freaked out. But maybe that’s the problem. He’s so obsessed with me. And we’ve only been dating for three weeks. I feel like I didn’t get to experience the chase. There was no waiting, no wondering, no butterflies when a text finally comes through. It was like he gave me everything right away — before I even asked. Before I even got to know him It feels like he fell in love with how I looked — not with who I am. And now that I have it all, I don’t even feel like I earned it. I didn’t get to play the game, just got handed the prize. And now it doesn’t feel exciting — it feels suffocating. So… what would you do? Would you stay, knowing he’s kind, thoughtful, generous — honestly husband material — even if your heart isn’t completely in it? Or would you walk away because something just doesn’t feel right?
Am I being ungrateful? Am I too picky? Too full of myself? Or is it okay to want something different — even if it looks perfect from the outside?

I don’t know. But I’d really love to hear what you guys think.

I also asked some of my online friends on their opinion, and they told me to keep him and stop being picky, because in this generation, it's hard to find a guy who even gives you a second glance. And I have the full package. The tall, muscular guy. With green eyes and blonde hair. The handsome man. The book boyfriend.",1,1748589354.0,Breakupadvice,0,1.0,False

Is getting one near where we are staying in Tokyo for our first night and heading straight there our first morning the best idea or is there a station near the highway we should try to get to in order to avoid travel in the city? And just confirming if we would be able to drop off the car in Takayama or Osaka after we were finished using it? 

Our current itinerary and how we think this could work but need help and advise on:
day 1: 
- arriving late afternoon at Narita airport
- train to Tokyo station and checking in to our accomodation. Staying in cheap air bnb we found in ahkibara. 
- exploring abit near the air BnB but early sleep to get up as early as possible the next day. Would this help avoid traffic?
Day 2: 
- picking up rental car. Where would this be best to do? Any recommended companies?
- drive to shirakawago. Best route for this that lets us see heaps of the country but not at the expense of taking heaps longer? What’s the parking like in shirakawago?
- explore shirakawago then travel to Gokayama. Is Gokayama worth it? Is there parking?
- travel to Takayama where we check into accomodation. Check in is after 3pm that’s why I thought we’d use this day to explore Shirakawago as I’ve read it doesn’t take a whole day to explore. Is this too much jam packed into a day?
- Settle into accomodation in Takayama and walk around the streets of old town. Accomodation has parking spots but what’s driving like in Takayama? We are staying right near Falò Coffee Brewers.
Day 2
- wake up early and driving to kamikochi to hike and spend the day. I’ve read that cars are not allowed to enter so what would be the best way to get there as early as possible in the morning with a car and the best parking? 
- return car as late as possible that night in Takayama after driving back from kamikochi 

We are travelling to Osaka after one more day in Takayama where we will be mainly exploring the town itself and Hida. Should we keep the car for another day or two and use it to drive to Osaka or would a train be better? We are staying in Dotonbori in Osaka. We finish our trip back in Tokyo for 4 days after a few in Osaka, Kyoto and the surrounding areas. We wanted to start our trip in and around Takayama to scratch our nature and hiking itch then we are heading to Osaka -> Kyoto -> finish back in and flying out of Tokyo

""Ms. Wardolf, you should replace your hearing aid, or your hearing could be affected,"" reminded Dr. Simon Jangger.

Melody Wardolf was in Simon's office right then, sitting across from him. She had just finished her shift as a nurse and hadn't even had time to change out of her scrubs yet.

""Thank you, Dr. Jangger. I understand,"" she said as she nodded.

Simon sighed. ""Ms. Wardolf, according to your latest check-up, I think it's best you get a cochlear implant as soon as possible. The surgery isn't that expensive nowadays. Everything, including recovery, will only cost about 600 thousand dollars.""

He paused, and his smile became even gentler. ""That kind of money is nothing to your family, so there's no reason to drag it out.""

When Melody first started out at the hospital, the Wardolf family had donated two imported machines to them, so everyone knew that the Wardolfs were loaded.

After leaving the office, Melody took out her phone and used the banking app to check her account balance. It showed ""$56,005.83"".

This was all the money she had saved this past year.

Simon was right. 600 thousand dollars was nothing to the Wardolf family, but it was an astronomical sum for her.

Melody was adopted by the Wardolf family. From a young age, she could only have what the Wardolfs voluntarily gave her, and she needed to show her sincere gratitude in return.

If they hadn't given her something, she was not allowed to ask for it. Otherwise, she'd be seen as ungrateful and not knowing what was good for her.

By the time Melody changed out of her scrubs and got home, it was nearly 7:00 pm.

The weather had been quite gloomy lately in Jembina. There were constant light showers, causing people to feel sluggish.

Melody didn't live in the Wardolf residence. She stayed at an apartment near the hospital.

She had just opened the door when she noticed the light in the entryway was on. She froze.

Jeremy Chesson was home.

She slowed her movements and carefully checked whether any raindrops or mud had splattered on her.

Jeremy was a well-known miracle worker at Jembina Hospital. He was also the youngest doctor to become the lead surgeon in the neurosurgery department.

He had severe germaphobia and could not tolerate even the slightest dirt.

He also happened to be Melody's fiancé.

In order to help them foster their relationship, the Wardolfs and the Chessons allowed Melody to move in with Jeremy.

After all, it was only because of an accident that they were engaged in the first place.

Melody cleaned herself up before entering. The light in the entryway was on, but the one in the living room wasn't.

However, she could still see a person on the couch. It seemed like Jeremy was asleep as he hadn't shown any reaction to her moving around.

Melody walked up to him and saw that his eyes were closed. While looking at his face, she couldn't help but notice his long, thick eyelashes.

Jeremy's nickname at the hospital was Neuro God. Not only did he have such godly skills that he reached the position of lead surgeon at such a young age, but he also had a godlike appearance.

Jeremy was extremely handsome. He was so good-looking that Melody only dared to stare at him when he was asleep.

She hadn't seen him in quite a while. He went overseas to attend an academic conference and had only returned two days ago. When he returned, he had to perform a major surgery, spending about six or seven hours in the operating room both yesterday and today.

There were faint dark circles under his eyes, and his brows were furrowed slightly, appearing as if he wasn't getting a restful sleep.

The living room window was open, and the cold wind mixed with splatters of rain blew in.

Jeremy only had a shirt on. Melody's eyes fluttered, and her gaze fell on her small blanket that was sitting on the armchair.

She hesitantly reached for the blanket. For some reason, she did not dare to proceed further. She then planted herself down on her armchair, clutched the blanket close to herself, and fixed her gaze on Jeremy once again.

She knew he was tired, so she didn't want to wake him. He rarely had much time to rest.

However, right then, his phone on the coffee table started buzzing. Melody flinched, and she reached her hand out instinctively to mute it.

That was when a low voice sounded. ""What are you doing?""

Melody spun around, and she found herself locking eyes with Jeremy. Her heart lurched.

Jeremy's eyes were big and bright even in the dimly lit living room. His expression was blank as he continued to stare at her.

Melody had completely frozen. She stammered in a soft voice, ""I… I wasn't going to do anything. I just saw you sleeping, so… I…""

She wanted to explain, but she was so nervous that she was getting tongue-tied.

Jeremy's gaze shifted downward, stopping at her outstretched hand. Melody followed his gaze, suddenly feeling as if her right hand was scalded.

She abruptly pulled her hand back and helplessly wiped her fingers on her sleeves, as if her fingers were dirty.

She then looked back up at Jeremy and said cautiously, ""I… I didn't touch your stuff.""

Jeremy raised his head as Melody continued to stand there, dazed.

A flash of indifference crossed his emotionless eyes.

""Don't touch or even get close to any of my things. How many times do I need to repeat myself?""

Melody was at a complete loss. She wanted to explain, but she didn't know where to begin. She had never been good with words.

Before she moved in, Jeremy had stressed that she was not allowed to touch any of his belongings.

Even though they had lived together as an engaged couple for over half a year, everything in the apartment was clearly labeled. She could only touch the things that had her name on it. Everything else was off-limits.

She wasn't even allowed into the areas where Jeremy hung around the most. Just like in this large living room, the only thing she was allowed to use was this small armchair.

He really did have severe germophobia.

Jeremy glanced at his still-buzzing phone, and his eyebrows furrowed with clear displeasure. However, he held it in and answered the phone.

Before the person on the other end could speak, he ordered, ""Help me buy a new phone and send it over immediately.""

He then glanced at the couch before continuing, ""Also, find someone to replace the couch and do another round of disinfections.""

He had said all that while maintaining a blank expression.

Melody followed his gaze. That was when she realized that a small corner of her blanket had ended up resting on Jeremy's couch.

She lowered her gaze, not daring to speak or even look at him. Instead, she stared at her right hand. Then, she slowly hid both her hands behind her back.

Her left hand rubbed her right hand vigorously. She wanted to tell Jeremy that she wasn't dirty.

Chapter 2

The air around Jeremy was frigid.

Melody stood stiffly in the living room, not daring to move a single muscle. She pursed her lips and even made her breathing shallower.

Everything about her was tense. It was as if she were a child who had done something wrong and was now waiting for her punishment.

As for Jeremy, he had promptly hung up the phone after speaking, then stood up to leave.

When he walked past Melody, he didn't stop or even spare her a glance, only leaving a soft breeze in his wake.

The front door opened, then closed again. Only the light in the entryway was still on, attempting to bring some brightness into the dimly lit living room.

Melody was left standing alone in the middle of the living room. She knew that Jeremy had likely returned to the hospital.

It wasn't the first time something like this had happened. They lived together, and as careful as Melody tried to be, there were still times when she accidentally touched his things.

There was once when Melody was cleaning the house and accidentally touched the glass that Jeremy regularly used. He then had someone replace everything in the house with new ones. Melody's belongings were also disinfected thoroughly.

Jeremy didn't return to the apartment for a whole month after that incident.

At the time, Melody was still clueless as to why. It was not until she was at the hospital that she overheard a colleague teasing Jeremy for being so dedicated to his work that he had not gone home for the past few days.

Jeremy answered nonchalantly, ""Someone touched my stuff and got them dirty.""

That was when Melody finally realized that Jeremy had such disdain for her.

Since then, she developed the habit of being extra cautious lest she touched anything of his again.

The rain continued for quite a long while.

Melody had assisted in a surgery earlier that day and was feeling quite tired. She didn't even have dinner and went straight to bed after washing up.

When she woke up the next morning, the place was the same as the night before. Everything was still quiet.

Jeremy clearly had not returned after leaving.

While washing up, Melody stared at herself in the mirror. Simon's words from the day before rang in her head.

Her hearing impairment wasn't a birth defect.

The Wardolfs were actually quite good to her. Andrew Wardolf, her adopted father, bought her the hearing aids she was currently using. They were a gift to celebrate her acceptance into Jembina School of Medicine.

The Wardolfs were great benefactors to her. She would never dare to ask for anything more.

After Melody got to the hospital and completed the shift change, she went to her patients' rooms to measure their blood pressure. On her way back to the nurse's station, she saw that the doctors were preparing to start their rounds.

It was a Monday, so rounds started a little later than usual.

Melody immediately caught sight of Jeremy standing amongst the crowd. He was wearing his white coat, and his eyes were lowered as he listened to the person beside him speak.

In this department, the experienced doctors weren't as young as him, and those younger than him weren't as capable. Thus, despite standing in a crowd, anyone would still notice him at first glance.

After what happened the night before, Melody felt a little nervous to see Jeremy.

The group of doctors stood in front of the nurse's station, blocking her way forward. So she lowered her head and stayed quiet, planning to wait for the doctors to leave before returning to her station.

That was when the head nurse saw her and called out, ""Melody, are you done taking the patients' blood pressure?""

Melody nodded. ""Yes, there are no changes, but the patient in Bed 29 has a fever. The patient's family asked me to get a doctor to check.""

""How's the older gentleman in Bed 4?""

Melody checked her notes before answering carefully, ""Everything looks normal, and he's also not resisting treatment anymore. However, he is constantly asking when he can be discharged.""

Suddenly, a low voice sounded beside her. ""The patient in Bed 4?""

Melody pursed her lips ever so slightly before she turned to Jeremy.

""Yes, the one with the acute cerebral infarction.""

""I know,"" Jeremy interrupted, his dark eyes focused on her. ""Why did you say he was resisting treatment?""

The older gentleman in Bed 4 was admitted after Jeremy had left for his conference. After resuscitating him, the man rejected further treatment as he believed that he was merely a burden should he continue to live.

Before Melody could respond, another doctor jumped in.

""Dr. Chesson, you don't know how difficult that patient has been. We've dispatched nearly everyone in this department, but no one was able to change his mind, at least not until Ms. Wardolf here. Thank goodness for her.

""Ms. Wardolf has a good personality and is good-tempered, too. It's no wonder all the patients in our ward like her,"" the doctor praised with a smile.

Melody only lowered her head and didn't respond.

After a while, though, she murmured softly, ""It's all part of the job.""

Though her head was lowered, she stood upright. Her scrubs were clean and neat, as if they were brand new.

Melody could feel a certain gaze on her. She pursed her lips and tried to appear calm and collected.

Since starting in this department, she had always been the most responsible one. It was because she wanted to do better whenever she was in front of him.

Even if that gaze would only linger on her for a second before shifting away, she still wanted to excel and be more diligent. At least, she wanted him to think she wasn't that bad.

However, in the next second, Jeremy spoke up, sounding apathetic.

""As medical personnel, it's our duty to do everything we can to save our patients. So there's nothing to applaud here.""

The air surrounding them seemed to freeze. Melody unconsciously clenched her fingers as she responded softly, ""I understand.""

By the time she looked up, Jeremy had already turned to leave. She only caught a glimpse of his cold-looking side profile.

Most working at the hospital knew Melody and Jeremy were engaged. After all, when Melody first started work, the Wardolf family had made donations to the hospital to bolster their reputation. It even ended up on the news.

A close colleague couldn't help but feel sorry for her.

""Dr. Chesson is too unfeeling. How could he say that?""

Melody pursed her lips while she worked on her paperwork. In the end, she still spoke up for him.

""He's right. It is our duty to treat patients, so there's nothing to make a fuss about.""

""Goodness, Melody. You're always defending Dr. Chesson, regardless.""

Everyone in the department knew that Melody was Jeremy's biggest fan. No matter what he did, she would always be the first to support him. Even when, most of the time, he didn't even need her to do so.

Someone once joked that while others might be idealistic or materialistic, Melody was only ever Jeremy-istic. No one dared repeat these jokes in front of Jeremy because everyone knew that Jeremy did not like Melody.

More accurately, Jeremy didn't even pay an ounce of attention to her.

Chapter 3

That afternoon, Melody received a call from Andrew right as she finished her work.

""Dad,"" Melody greeted respectfully.

""Come over to Regallo Villas tonight. I have something to discuss with you.""

""Okay."" Melody was always meek and obedient toward the Wardolf family.

""Bring Jeremy with you.""

Melody did not have a chance to respond before Andrew hung up the phone. The dial tone that followed sounded unfeeling and impatient, like it was rushing her.

She looked toward the direction of the doctors' offices, hesitating slightly.

In the end, she headed over. Just as she was about to knock on the door, Harold Franklin walked up next to her.

Harold was none other than the doctor who had praised her earlier that day. He had a patient's file in hand and smiled at Melody when he saw her.

""Ms. Wardolf, are you here to see Dr. Chesson?""

Melody nodded. ""Yes, I've something to tell him.""

Harold handed the file over to her. ""Everyone's gone to grab a bite. He should be inside resting. Since you're going in anyway, could you hand Bed 4's patient file to him? The chief is waiting to discuss something with me.""

Harold had spewed out the words rather quickly, seeming to be in a real rush. While he was at it, he even opened the door for Melody before he turned around and left.

Thus, she had no choice but to head inside with the patient file.

The moment she walked in, however, she heard an alarmed gasp and a suppressed sob from a woman.

Melody was startled. Instantly, she heard Jeremy's low voice asking, ""Who let you in?""

Melody froze and turned to look at Jeremy. A female patient came into view. She was sitting in front of Jeremy's desk, her face covered in tears.

Melody immediately snapped back to her senses. Most patients in the neurology ward had major issues. Most of them struggled to accept the reality of their conditions and would have meltdowns.

It was natural that these people didn't want others around to witness their breakdown.

Melody immediately lowered her gaze and apologized softly, ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.""

Jeremy didn't respond and turned to comfort the patient before him. His lowered voice had a reassuring quality to it.

""How about you go back to your room first, or you could go down for a walk to clear your head. Feel free to come find me if you have any questions.""

The female patient was soothed by his gentle voice. She then hurried out of his office with her head down.

Melody continued to stand there, feeling helpless.

She had always known that Jeremy's gentleness could get anyone to do anything. Unfortunately, his gentleness was never directed at her.

With her head hung low, she softly explained, ""Dr. Franklin asked me to give this file to you.""

She did not mention that she wasn't the one to open the door.

""The door was closed. Do you not know how to knock?""

As always, Jeremy was dressed impeccably. His face was emotionless as he continued to question her. ""Did no one tell you about the rule of not invading the patients' privacy?""

""I didn't.""

Melody wasn't someone who shirked responsibility, but right then, she didn't know how to explain herself either. So, after denying it, she fell silent again.

Jeremy was holding a pen in his hand, and his eyes were so dark that they looked like the abyss. He rarely showed any outward emotion, but in that moment, Melody could clearly tell he was angry.

She bit her bottom lip and placed the file on the desk. She spoke slowly because of how nervous she was. ""I won't do it again.""

Jeremy tossed his pen onto the table, and it landed with a dull thud. ""Remember to use your brain when you do things,"" he said, his tone unpleasant.

As Melody stood there, a deep sense of embarrassment surged within her. She had never known how to communicate with others.

After her hearing was impaired when she was young, her speech soon became affected as well. So, she usually talked slowly.

She had even been mocked by others for stuttering. Since then, she became more quiet and withdrawn.

Jeremy, naturally, didn't notice any of this. He just spat coldly, ""Get out.""

Melody bit her lip again before speaking in a small voice, ""Dad called earlier. He asked us to go to Regallo Villas for dinner tonight.""

The only thing that answered her was Jeremy's silence.

She thought he hadn't heard her, so she repeated herself. ""Dad said—""

This time, however, Jeremy interrupted her before she could finish.

He grabbed the patient file and then put it down again. His sharp gaze fell on Melody, visibly irate. ""You're very noisy.""

Melody abruptly fell silent, not daring to say anything more.

Under Jeremy's icy stare, her fingers clenched together slowly. Her usual smile was plastered on her face, and she fought to keep it there, not daring to let it falter.

She sniffed, then blurted out softly, ""Then, I'll wait for you to get off work.""

With that, she rushed out of the office. Even in her rush, she did not dare make too much noise. She shut the door carefully and gently, worried that she'd disturb Jeremy.

The hospital was as busy as usual that afternoon. By the time she finished her handover, it was already 6:00 pm.

Melody hurriedly changed out of her scrubs and went to find Jeremy.

However, when she arrived at his office, she noticed the door was slightly ajar. There seemed to be a meeting going on inside, so she could only wait outside.

When colleagues who had just gotten off work saw her waiting there, they all chuckled knowingly and teased, ""You're waiting for Dr. Chesson to get off work again? Keep going at it, Melody! We're still looking forward to your wedding!""

Melody pursed her lips and didn't respond, but her lowered head looked slightly flushed.

She waited outside the office for about half an hour before the door opened. A swarm of doctors came out, but not Jeremy.

Just as Melody was feeling lost, she saw Harold walking over to her. ""Ms. Wardolf, why haven't you left? I remember you being on the day shift today.""

""Where's Dr. Chesson? I don't think I've seen him,"" said Melody.

Harold blinked in surprise. ""Dr. Chesson left a while ago. He had a meeting this afternoon, so he left a little after 2:00 pm. Did he not inform you?""

Melody's breath hitched for a second. ""I guess he didn't tell me because I didn't ask him.""

Harold looked at her a little sympathetically and sighed. ""It's okay. He's busy, after all. There are times when he doesn't even reply to my messages.""

Melody smiled and thanked him before leaving the hospital herself.

She didn't call Jeremy or text him to visit Regallo Villas. She knew that Jeremy would always pay attention to matters with the Wardolf family.

And, as expected, when she arrived at Regallo Villas, she found Jeremy already there.

Chapter 4

Jeremy was always well-mannered in front of the Wardolfs. There was no particular reason for this other than that they were Cheryl's parents.

Cheryl Wardolf was the Wardolf's biological daughter and Melody's older sister. She was also the one who was supposed to be engaged to Jeremy.

However, she died due to an accident on the eve of the engagement party.

Jeremy and Cheryl had once been a couple envied by everyone.

Lately, they were in the middle of the rainy season. Melody had gotten slightly wet in the short time frame to open her umbrella after getting out of the car. She instinctively shivered when she walked into the heated private room.

She walked up to her parents and greeted them respectfully.

Her adoptive mother, Laura Luden, ignored her while Andrew said indifferently, ""Have a seat since you're here.""

""Okay,"" Melody meekly answered before heading to sit next to Jeremy.

However, she had barely sat down when Laura's displeased voice rang out.

""You sat down just because you're told to? Do you think there's a seat for you here?""

Melody stiffened.

Jeremy, in that emotionless tone of his, reminded her, ""Krystal's back.""

A look of confusion crossed Melody's eyes. She was about to ask when the sound of high heels clicking on the floor sounded behind her.

Laura got to her feet, a big smile on her face. ""Are you done with your phone call, Krys? Come here. We can ask them to start serving the food now.""

A crisp, pleasant-sounding voice came from behind. ""Excuse me, could you move? You're in my way.""

Melody turned around belatedly, only to freeze in her spot when she saw who was standing behind her.

The woman standing there was tall and stunning, but her neat bob made her strikingly beautiful face appear slightly colder.

However, what made Melody freeze was that this lady closely resembled Cheryl.

Krystal Finnigan, the lady in question, frowned slightly. It is likely because of how blatantly Melody was staring at her.

""This is my seat,"" she said in a cool voice.

Melody finally came back to her senses, and in the midst of it all, the dots connected for her.

Cheryl had a younger twin sister who went missing when she was very young. It wasn't until recently that Andrew brought her back.

Melody continued to study Krystal. Her face was so similar to Cheryl's that there was no denying it. That, and Laura's attitude, made everything clear.

Laura was getting impatient. ""Why are you still standing in the way? You're so oblivious.""

Melody lowered her gaze and reflexively took a few steps back, giving her seat to Krystal.

Krystal then walked right past Melody and sat down next to Jeremy.

Melody looked at Jeremy and parted her lips, wanting to say something. However, Jeremy gave her a look so apathetic that she could only swallow her words back down.

Jeremy had never been patient with her, so he naturally wouldn't care about the awkward situation she now found herself in. He also wouldn't bother to explain anything to her.

He found all that to be troublesome.

Regallo Villas was the Wardolfs' property, and this private room was specifically reserved for them.

When Cheryl was still alive, there were four people in the family. When Cheryl died, Jeremy joined them.

Andrew didn't like it when there were empty seats, so the room only ever had four chairs.

Now that Andrew, Laura, Jeremy, and Krystal were all seated, Melody could only stand helplessly to the side. Without Andrew's word, she didn't dare leave either.

Melody seemed completely out of place, surrounded by the opulence of her surroundings. However, no one seemed to notice her discomfort.

Laura only had eyes for Krystal. She looked at Krystal, her gaze dripping with pity and affection. ""Krys, I'm so sorry for everything you've suffered through all these years. We've never stopped looking for you.""

Krystal's expression didn't change, and her tone stayed indifferent despite Laura's concern. ""I've been fine. My parents love me very much.""

Laura's eyes instantly misted over, but her smile remained. ""It's all thanks to Jeremy. He ran into you when he was traveling for his conference. If he did not bring you back to do a paternity test, then who knows how long I would've needed to wait until we are finally reunited.""

""Yes, it was quite the coincidence,"" Jeremy answered nonchalantly.

After a beat of silence, he added, ""They look very much alike.""

As for who ""they"" meant, they all knew very well.

""Indeed."" Laura chuckled. ""However, I still want to thank you. You've been busy because of Krys these past two weeks or so. I heard you even applied for leave from the hospital and skipped an important meeting. Hopefully, that won't affect you much.""

Jeremy was unbothered. ""It was just a small meeting. It won't matter.""

A dozen thoughts ran through Melody's mind, and she clenched her fists so tightly that her fingernails dug into her palms.

This was the first time she heard Jeremy say that work wasn't that important.

He had always been meticulous, especially when it came to his work. He could be more demanding than the Chief of Neurosurgery. People would often say that he was like a machine that never tired.

In all the years he had worked at the hospital, he had never once taken leave or been absent.

As it turned out, he hadn't been to the conference for the two weeks or so while he was away. Instead, he had been going about bringing Krystal home.

So, there were still things and people more important to him than work.

Chapter 5

Melody was somewhat lost in thought until Andrew turned his attention to her. ""Melody, how have you been doing at the hospital lately? You haven't made any mistakes, right?""

Melody snapped out of her daze and responded softly, ""No.""

This was practically the routine each time Melody had dinner with them. Andrew would inevitably ask her this question and say the same things.

As expected, the next words out of his mouth were, ""You have problems with your hearing, so there's bound to be inconveniences at work. Always be extra careful. Don't assume that just because you've got the Wardolf family behind you, you can act carelessly.""

Melody lowered her gaze, appearing obedient and meek.

This was what pleased Andrew the most about his adopted daughter. It was then that he seemingly realized what was happening and said sternly, ""Melody, why are you still standing there? Have someone add a chair for you. We're having a family meal. It's silly that you're just standing around.""

By the time Melody took her seat, she found herself sitting opposite Jeremy.

The moment she looked up, she happened to meet his eyes. His gaze was as distant as usual, like he was looking at someone insignificant.

Even though Jeremy had always been cold toward her, she still felt a sharp pang in her heart when she saw him looking at her like this.

Moreover, she felt inexplicably nervous from the moment she laid eyes on Krystal.

There was a brief silence at the table before Laura broke it.

She looked at Jeremy with a pleased look on her face. ""Krys is a doctor too, and coincidentally, she's also in neurosurgery. Her father and I have already found a way to transfer her to Jembina Hospital. You'll need to help me watch out for her in the future.""

""Okay,"" answered Jeremy in his low voice.

This delighted Laura even more. However, when her eyes fell on Melody, displeasure immediately colored her expression. ""Why is there an outsider here at a family gathering,"" she grumbled.

She hadn't spoken loudly, but there were only five people in that room, so everyone still heard her loud and clear.

Melody stiffened at her comment.

Andrew looked at Laura, frowning. ""What are you talking about?""

Laura didn't want to put on a front any longer. ""Krys is my biological daughter! Now that my biological daughter is back, I naturally don't want to see the knock-off who enjoyed her privileged life in Krys' stead parading in front of me!""

Since it was out in the open, Laura couldn't be bothered to hold her real thoughts in. ""And Melody was engaged to Jeremy only because she took Cher's place. Now that Krys is back, Melody and Jeremy's engagement can be canceled! Don't you agree, Jeremy?""

Melody's breath hitched, and her whole body stiffened. In fact, she felt as if her heart had frozen over, too.

She sat there in a daze, watching as Laura continued to mumble on, but she heard nothing more. The only thing that rang through her mind was how Laura wanted to call off the engagement.

She glanced at Jeremy, but he remained expressionless, as if it had nothing to do with him.

Melody didn't even dare to blink, fearing she would miss any subtle changes in his expression.

After her hearing deteriorated, she enjoyed studying other people's expressions and attempting to find ways to communicate with them.

She studied Jeremy carefully, hands fisted tightly as she waited for Jeremy's response.

She didn't have a choice in this matter. She could only wait for the Wardolfs to finish their discussion, and then inform her of everything. She had never been an active participant in this family. She was merely an obedient and docile adopted daughter.

The sound of a glass being placed on the table broke the silence. Jeremy's emotionless gaze lingered on Melody for a second before shifting away.

His long fingers tapped on the table as he said, ""It was always Cheryl whom I was supposed to be engaged to.""

Melody's eyelashes trembled, and she unconsciously bit her lip. She heard Jeremy say, ""Other than her, everyone else is the same.""

Melody couldn't quite put her feelings into words right then. It was true that the person Jeremy had always liked was Cheryl.

If it weren't for Cheryl asking Jeremy to care for Melody, Jeremy would never have agreed to the Wardolfs' suggestion of getting engaged to Melody.

The person he had feelings for had died, so anyone else other than her would not make a difference to him.

Melody carefully explained this reasoning to herself.

Moreover, Cheryl had also been the best person she had ever met. Even she was still hung up about her death, let alone Jeremy.

Melody felt like she wasn't worthy compared to Cheryl.

However, right then, Krystal's icy voice rang out. ""What's the meaning of this? What do you mean he can cancel his engagement since I'm back?""

She crossed her arms over her chest and raised her chin slightly. Her gaze was cold and hard as it swept across everyone at the table, finally landing on Laura.

""You had me come back so I can be a pawn in your family's marriage arrangement?""

Her gaze then shifted to Melody. In a clearly mocking tone, she said, ""Isn't your pawn already sitting right there?""",1,1748589268.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1kyxym3,https://www.reddit.com/r/trauma/comments/1kyxym3/had_a_recent_experience_and_now_nowhere_feels/,"Had a recent experience, and now nowhere feels like home","I want to preface by saying I am afraid to even call this trauma and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post. I know there's so many more people here who have gone through far worse things than this and by rights I shouldn't be even allowed to say I'm traumatised, and I'm trying to hope for the best that it turns out I'm not and I just get over it and things go back to normal. But right now I do not feel normal, I don't feel safe, and the whole world feels wrong and alien.

I struggle with emetophobia, which is fear of vomiting, and I've more or less managed it fine for the past 10 or so years (I'm 32). But a couple of weeks ago I learned the hard way that I only was managing well because I hadn't been put in a situation where I have to confront my fear. My partner of 6 years got ill, and I went into shutdown, about a week of nonstop anxiety.

I stopped eating, isolated from him, and ended up stressing so badly that I felt ill myself even though I was probably not actually ill. I spent a few days in bed feeling sick and being afraid, sometimes to the point I couldn't stand up.

In times like these, he is the person I go to for reassurance. But he was the source of my fear. Food, likewise, is usually my go-to when I'm anxious, but that also was the source of my fear. Even my bed, usually a place I go to feel better when I'm anxious or overwhelmed, is now associated with the experience since I spent so many days in it feeling awful.

My anxiety has reduced now from a red alert siren to a steady hum, but now I'm facing a new problem which is that I feel as though I've travelled to an alternate reality where my home isn't my home, nowhere is safe. I wake up in the morning and greet my partner and drink my coffee, but nothing feels right and I just have this pervasive feeling of ""I want to go home"".

The coffee doesn't taste the same, and my bed makes me feel sick when I climb into it. Some of my favourite movies and songs, I realised today, have also been tainted - I used them when I felt ill to try to calm down, but I put one on today and it made me feel so uneasy I had to shut it off.

Worst of all my partner, I love him so much, he's everything to me, but it's like my brain doesn't recognise him. He looks the same and sounds the same and acts the same but now every time I look at him it's like I'm looking at a stranger wearing his skin. I feel like a terrible person even having this thought.

Like I said, I'm reluctant to even call this trauma. It all feels so silly, to be so affected by something that's just a part of life and that so many others just live with and don't think twice. I'm trying to be optimistic. I just want to go back to normal.

I guess the point of this post is, I'm hoping there's someone out there who can tell me they've felt like I feel, perhaps not from the same type of fear but anything. Is it dissociation, or shock, or something else? How do I get home again?",2,1748589258.0,trauma,0,1.0,False

We decided not to buy a new one of this kind and to get an espresso machine instead. A friend of ours has a Sage Barista Express, and the coffee was on another level compared to what we were used to from ours. I drink espresso and cappuccino, but my wife prefers caffè crema. I was thinking of buying the Sage Barista Express Impress — it’s newer than the Express, and the price difference here in Germany is only $100. But then I saw the new DeLonghi La Specialista Opera, which from the looks of it does the same thing but also has a caffè crema option. Price is the same. I read this article and watched the video but i’m still undecided: https://tomscoffeecorner.com/delonghi-la-specialista-opera-vs-breville-barista-express-impress/

Which one would you recommend? Can you also make a crema with the Sage machine somehow?

One second I was hidden in the shadows,"# Chapter 1: When Alpha King Tastes Like Sin [https://writers.odsgame.com/bad-husband-1/](https://writers.odsgame.com/bad-husband-1/)

**Ava's POV**

The room froze when I saw him kiss her. One second I was hidden in the shadows, and the next my claws were digging into my palms, blood dripping onto the marble floor.

*Control, Ava. You can't shift here.*

I stood in the darkest corner of Moonlight Lodge's ballroom. My champagne tasted like cardboard. Shadow Creek pack was still a mess after our Alpha's death last month. Not the time or place for me to lose control.

Jackson and Sophia swayed on the dance floor. My ex-fated mate couldn't keep his hands off the Silverpeak princess. When she laughed at whatever he whispered, pain shot through my mark.

My neck burned where he'd marked me. Four months ago, he swore we were meant to be. Now he's chasing power instead of love. His plan was simple: marry the Alpha King's daughter, become Shadow Creek's next Alpha. Easy upgrade from dating a nobody like me.

My fangs were already pressing against my lower lip. No amount of breathing exercises would stop this shift if I stayed watching them another minute.

I set down my champagne and made a beeline for the bar. Maybe alcohol could drown the rage before I fully transformed in a room full of elites who'd eat me alive for the entertainment value.

""Double whiskey,"" I growled, not bothering to hide the gravel in my voice. The bartender's eyes widened at what must have been the yellow glow of my irises.

""Make that a Moonlight Martini for the lady,"" a deep voice cut in. ""And the whiskey for me.""

My wolf froze mid-snarl. Just... stopped. Like someone had hit pause on her fury.

I turned and looked up—way up—into eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea. They weren't just looking at me; they were seeing through me.

He wasn't pretty-boy handsome like Jackson. This man's face had character—laugh lines at the corners of his eyes, a slight crease between his brows from frowning too much. Dark hair with silver at the temples. His suit fit him like a second skin, but couldn't hide the raw power underneath.

But his scent—*fuck*. Rain-soaked pine trees, woodsmoke, and something wild that made my wolf sit up and beg. The complete opposite to Jackson's cologne-masked scent that never made my wolf react like this.

""I didn't ask for your input,"" I said, trying to sound tough while my wolf was practically rolling over.

One corner of his mouth kicked up. ""You're about thirty seconds from shifting in a roomful of pack leaders. The drink has wolfsbane extract. It'll help.""

I glanced down at my hands. Claws, not fingernails.

""Whatever,"" I muttered.

The bartender slid over the martini—swirling silver-blue like moonlight on water.

The stranger leaned closer. ""Drink up. Your eyes are giving you away.""

I knocked it back in one go, grimacing at the bitter aftertaste.

""Better?"" he asked, voice so deep I felt it in my chest.

The effect was almost immediate. My wolf settled, claws retracting, teeth returning to normal.

""Thanks,"" I said reluctantly. ""Though I'm not sure why you give a damn if I make a scene.""

His eyes flicked to the dance floor, then back to me with unexpected heat. ""Let's just say I have a soft spot for underdogs.""

Before I could respond, people started moving aside, stepping back to clear a path. For him. The penny dropped.

""You're Blake Morgan,"" I said, my stomach doing a backflip. ""The Silverpeak Alpha.""

*The Alpha King. The one who could destroy every Alpha in the world with a single command.*

My wolf cowered and preened at the same time, a confusing mix.

""And you're wearing a mate mark that's being rejected."" His gaze dropped to my neck where the silver-white mark throbbed. ""Who did that to you?""

The question hung between us. Telling the Alpha King that his future son-in-law had marked and abandoned me seemed like a bad idea.

""Someone who decided power was more attractive than keeping his word,"" I said instead.

His eyes narrowed slightly. ""Your control is slipping again. Come with me.""

It wasn't a suggestion. The words carried the weight of Alpha command, pressing against my will. My wolf, weirdly, didn't mind.

He guided me toward a private elevator, not touching me but close enough that his body heat reached across the inches between us. My skin prickled like I'd stuck my finger in an outlet.

The top floor suite was bigger than my entire house. Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the forest and mountains beyond, silver moonlight pouring across dark furniture.

He went to a cabinet, returning with a glass of water and some dried herbs.

""Chew these,"" he instructed.

I raised an eyebrow. ""You always carry herbs for random werewolves having meltdowns?""

""Only the interesting ones."" Something dangerous flashed in his eyes. ""The mark on your neck—it's making you lose control, isn't it?""

I touched it reflexively, wincing. ""They never covered 'what to do when your fated mate dumps you' in werewolf school.""

""It's strange to see a marked wolf without their mate present."" His voice dropped lower. ""Especially at an event where that mate might be.""

The gears turned behind his eyes. He was connecting the dots—my reaction downstairs, the mark, his daughter's fiancé.

""It's Jackson, isn't it?"" he asked quietly. ""My daughter's fiancé marked you.""

I couldn't speak, but my silence said it all.

""When?""

""Four months ago,"" I said, tasting the bitterness. ""Right before he decided being the next Shadow Creek Alpha was worth more than honoring a fated mate bond.""

Blake's jaw tightened, the only sign that my words hit home. ""And he never tried to break the mark properly?""

""Apparently dumping me in a coffee shop with 'it's not personal, it's politics' counts as closure in his book.""

Blake moved closer, his scent wrapping around me like a warm blanket. My wolf, who should have been cowering before the most powerful Alpha in our world, was instead practically purring.

""May I?"" His fingers hovered near my neck, not quite touching the mark.

I should have said no. This was Sophia's father. Jackson's future father-in-law. But my wolf pressed forward, tilting my head to expose the mark.

When his fingertips brushed my skin, lightning shot through me. His eyes darkened, pupils expanding.

Something flashed in his expression—surprise, confusion, then interest.

Instead of pulling away, he traced the outline of the mark. Heat bloomed from his touch, not the burning pain I'd gotten used to, but something warm and sweet that pooled low in my belly.

I couldn't deny it. My wolf was straining toward him like he was the last steak on earth.

""Why?"" I whispered.

*Why am I reacting to my ex's future father-in-law?*

He shook his head slowly, still touching my neck. ""I don't know what this is. But I want to find out.""

The pull between us grew stronger with each heartbeat. When he finally leaned down, it felt inevitable—his mouth meeting mine with a hunger that matched my own. My hands grabbed his shirt, dragging him closer. His arms wrapped around me, lifting me effortlessly against him.

It was crazy. Completely nuts. He was the father of the woman who'd stolen my mate. The most powerful werewolf alive. And I was nobody—just a Delta's adopted daughter with a worthless mate mark.

My wolf didn't care. She recognized something in him that cut through all that human BS.

Just as his hands slid lower, a voice sliced through my mind:

*Ava... they took your father...*

I gasped, color draining from my face. My mother's voice, shaky and terrified, crashed through our mindlink with an urgency that chilled my blood.

1kyxwjw,https://i.redd.it/bf8zo3lwcv3f1.jpeg,"$ATYR - Google Trends as a Leading Indicator: Deep Dive Across Search, Price and Narrative","Hey folks,

There are plenty of tools available for gauging social sentiment—and I’m sure many of you have your preferred platforms for tracking chatter across Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, or Discord. These platforms offer rich signals about real-time sentiment and positioning. But for this post, I’ve kept things deliberately simple: I’ve used **Google Trends**, and only Google Trends.

**Why?** Because it’s accessible to everyone, free, and captures a universal behavior—search. We all search when we’re curious, when we’re researching, or when we’re ready to act. So while this analysis uses only Google as a lens, it’s meant as a broader proxy—a principle that can be extended to online interest more generally, whether through search, posts, or engagement.

Over time, as more market participants rely on digital research and chatter-based exploration, Google Trends may become an even more powerful signal. It’s imperfect, but directionally interesting. And for a name like **$ATYR**—where stealth fundamentals may outpace visibility—signals like this can matter.

Over the last few months, we’ve looked at $ATYR from a myriad of institutional angles. But today I want to introduce a **retail-adjacent perspective** we haven’t tackled yet—and that’s **Google search behavior**.

This is a serious inquiry into how retail attention forms, how quickly search interest translates into capital flows, and how tools like Google Trends—while often dismissed—can offer real signal when used with context. We’re not looking at this in isolation. We’re going to cross-reference it with:

- Historical stock price movement
- Known company developments and milestone dates
- Institutional buy-in timelines
- And broader sentiment waves

The goal isn’t to claim causality—but to assess **correlation**, **timing**, and whether we’re seeing **leading indicators** of retail awareness forming before (or after) capital follows. Because in a name like $ATYR—with low float, stealth fundamentals, and accelerating institutional buy-in—early retail visibility can signal **narrative ignition**. And that can matter a lot.

Before diving in, I also want to say a quick thank you to everyone who’s chipped in a few bucks to support my work over the past few days—it really means a lot. And for those of you reading and lurking (and that’s most of you!), I just want to gently remind you: this is unpaid. I’m doing my best to put out **institutional-grade, forensic-level research** on my own time. This is, for all intents and purposes, **freeware**—and if you’ve found value in it, I’d ask that you consider supporting me through the Buy Me a Coffee link right here: [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/biobingo](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/biobingo).

There’s a real person behind the screen here—sifting data, writing, refining—and your support genuinely helps me do more of it. And if you do donate, I’ll make sure you get a personal thank-you message from me as well.

Let’s get into it.

## What the Google Trends Chart Shows

The Google Trends dataset tracks search interest for the term **""NASDAQ:ATYR""** over time. We pulled this across an **18-month window (June 2023 – November 2024)** using worldwide search data—not filtered to any one country.

This timeframe covers the most important phase of $ATYR’s evolution—from **total obscurity** to **rising visibility**.

Here’s the structural progression:

- **May to August 2024**: Essentially **zero search interest**. Flatlined baseline, no signal.
- **Early September 2024**: The first measurable uptick in searches begins.
- **October 2024**: Stronger climb in Google Trends begins to align with first major price breakout.
- **November to February**: Search interest remains consistently elevated (**30–60 range**), with occasional volatility.
- **March 2025**: Sharp spike in search interest, corresponding with a major catalyst cluster.
- **April 2025**: Drop-off in interest, in line with stock retracement.
- **May 2025**: Strong resurgence, with a steep trend suggesting a new wave of incoming interest.

**In short**: search interest was dormant for months, ignited ahead of price, held steady through consolidation, spiked on major news, cooled off briefly, and is now rising again in what looks like **pre-catalyst anticipation**.

## 11 Deep Insights from Google Trends vs Price and Newsflow

1. **Search Interest Rose Before the Breakout in October 2024**  
   The first non-zero rise in Google Trends occurred in **early September 2024**—weeks **before** the stock moved significantly. This correlates with:  
   - **Oct 2**: *European Respiratory Journal* publication on efzofitimod  
   - **Oct 8**: CHEST conference highlight  

   **So what?** That early lift in search activity likely reflects a subset of **high-conviction researchers** or **biotech retail** starting to pick up the story. For a **low-float stock**, this is critical—it shows that before price responded, narrative energy was already building. The implication is that Google Trends may act as a **true front-running signal** of attention formation. This can help retail and institutions alike better time entry into under-the-radar names.

2. **Stealth Accumulation Was Possible During Zero-Interest Phase**  
   Back in **May–July 2024**, the stock completed **Phase 3 enrollment** and announced clinical updates—but Google Trends was **flat**. No one was looking.  

   That gave early institutional players the opportunity to build positions **without retail friction**. It also marked the purest **value phase**, where signal was highest and visibility was lowest.  

   **So what?** This reinforces that the market was **not pricing in fundamental progress**. It underscores the dislocation between **intrinsic value** and **attention-based valuation**, which in biotech is often a source of **asymmetric upside**. For traders looking for deep value in clinical-stage companies, the **absence of search interest**—when combined with strong fundamentals—can be an **entry signal**, not a warning sign.

3. **Google Trends Created a Sentiment Floor**  
   After the breakout, search interest **did not collapse**. Instead, it settled into a steady range (**~30–40**) through **Q4 2024 and early Q1 2025**.  

   That’s significant. It suggests retail interest was **not purely event-driven**. There was **stickiness** to the narrative.  

   **So what?** This search floor indicates **persistent interest** even after the initial catalyst passed. That can support future breakout conditions—when the floor of engagement is higher, the marginal effort to ignite the next wave is lower. It also suggests that the thesis is **resonating with a core cohort** of investors—not just tourists.

4. **March 2025 Spike Was a Reflexive Loop**  
   In March, search interest **surged** again—coinciding with:  
   - **Mar 6**: 4th DSMB positive review  
   - **Mar 12**: *Science Translational Medicine* paper  
   - **Mar 13**: FY2024 results  
   - **Mar 26**: Appointment of Head of Commercial (Dalia Rayes)  

   Stock price moved **in tandem**. This wasn’t lagging behavior—it was a **feedback loop**. Rising search interest and price action reinforced each other.  

   **So what?** This phase shows how **reflexivity manifests**—attention drives price, price drives more attention. In small caps with strong fundamentals, this loop can create **violent upside**. March gave us a controlled preview of what a **fully ignited reflexive cycle** could look like post-readout. The lesson? Watch for this loop forming again.

5. **Post-Spike Correction Did Not Fully Reset Interest**  
   In **April**, the stock dropped back toward **$2.80**. Google Trends declined too—but **did not return to baseline**.  

   This tells us the March surge wasn’t just a **hype event**. Enough investors remained engaged to sustain a **higher-than-pre-breakout level** of attention.  

   **So what?** This validates the **durability of the narrative**. Many retail-led surges revert fully after hype fades—this one didn’t. It suggests a **core base of conviction-holders** remained, likely due to the credibility of the science and upcoming catalysts. That’s important for future **launch velocity**.

6. **May 2025 Trends Resurgence Preceded Price Move**  
   Before the late May move from **~$3.30 to $4.30**, search interest began to climb again. This occurred **ahead of price**, and ahead of official catalyst events like **ATS 2025**.  

   This is a **second instance** where Google Trends appears to **lead capital deployment**.  

   **So what?** This pattern matters. It suggests retail attention is **re-engaging based on expectation**, not just reaction. That’s often the **harbinger of a third wave** in a three-phase rally. If May–June news delivers, this search interest could mark the start of an **inflection phase**.

7. **Search Volume Peaks Are Tightly Linked to Science Events**  
   The strongest correlations are **not with earnings**, but with:  
   - Peer-reviewed publications  
   - Conference abstracts  
   - DSMB updates  

   This implies the audience driving Google search behavior may be **more scientifically literate** than typical retail segments—possibly **biotech retail** or **crossover fund research teams**.  

   **So what?** This tells us the story isn’t being driven by **hype traders** or speculators—it’s being followed by people who care about **scientific validation**. That elevates the **quality of attention** and increases the likelihood of **retail-institutional narrative convergence**. That’s a strong setup for a **rerate**.

8. **Narrative Arc Matches Classic Two-Stage Discovery Curve**  
   We see a **first wave of discovery** in October (science-led), a **second wave** in March (clinical and commercial-led), and now a **potential third wave** (anticipation-driven).  

   That narrative shape mirrors the “**low awareness → catalyst ignition → digestion → resurgence**” playbook seen in multi-phase biotech rallies.  

   **So what?** Understanding where we are on the curve helps with **timing**. If we’re entering **wave three**, it means the next breakout could be **sharper and broader**—as both sides (retail and institutional) converge ahead of Q3 catalysts. It’s a useful heuristic for **phase-based capital deployment**.

9. **Search Behavior Signals Pre-FOMO Dynamics**  
   While there’s a visible rise in interest, the overall search volume is **still not saturated**. That suggests we’re **not in full FOMO mode** yet.  

   That gives a setup where future catalysts could ignite a **sharp reflexive response**, especially if price and search reinforce each other.  

   **So what?** There’s still room for **awareness expansion**. That’s exactly what you want ahead of a major readout. The **marginal buyer** still hasn’t arrived. When that wall of demand hits, **supply (the float)** may not be there to meet it. This creates **discontinuity risk to the upside**.

10. **Retail Attention is Starting to Compound with Institutional Setup**  
    As institutional ownership has risen (**Goldman, Schwab, Octagon, etc.**), Google Trends has tracked a **parallel retail awakening**.  

    This could create a **compressed float squeeze scenario** if the narrative hits critical mass—especially in a name with a float **~86M**.  

    **So what?** This is the **convergence point**. When retail and institutional stories begin overlapping—especially in **low-float, undervalued biotech setups**—you get the kind of buying pressure that can drive **explosive rerates**. Google Trends tells us that retail is warming up just as institutional conviction peaks. That’s a **fragile and potentially explosive setup** if the catalysts align.

11. **Elevated Search Interest Despite Suppressive Shorting Dynamics**  
    At various moments in $ATYR’s timeline—particularly in the lead-up to anticipated catalysts—we’ve observed **heightened short interest** or **borrow rate spikes**. These are often interpreted as forms of **market suppression**, whether driven by hedging activity, skepticism, or deliberate pressure. What’s striking is that during some of these periods, Google Trends shows **elevated or rising search interest**, even as price may be constrained.  

    **So what?** This creates a **divergence worth investigating**. If shorting activity is intensifying while retail curiosity is simultaneously increasing, it suggests that market participants are **not being deterred** by price action alone. Instead, they are continuing to **research, revisit, and possibly reassess** the opportunity. This could reflect **latent demand** building beneath surface-level price suppression—or it might indicate an **information mismatch** between short-term traders and longer-horizon investors. Either way, this divergence between suppression and search interest deserves monitoring as a **potential pressure valve**—if the thesis is confirmed by catalysts, the release could be **sudden and aggressive**.

## Is Google Trends a Leading or Lagging Indicator for $ATYR?

The evidence is **mixed**—but **strongly directional**. When viewed through the lens of timing, behavior, and narrative construction, we see multiple signals suggesting Google Trends operates as a **leading or coinciden**t indicator, rather than a lagging one:

- **Leading in September 2024**: Search activity noticeably increased **before** the breakout from **~$2 to ~$3.80**. This was **prior to any major retail momentum** and appears to reflect **genuine investor discovery**.  
- **Coincident in March 2025**: A **simultaneous spike** in both search volume and share price, driven by a dense cluster of events (STM publication, 4th DSMB, appointment of Dalia Rayes). This was a classic **reflexive loop**—attention and price driving each other.  
- **Leading again in May 2025**: Search interest began climbing **before** the price moved from **~$3.30 to $4.30**. This occurred **days ahead** of the ATS 2025 conference and visible narrative momentum.  

There is **no evidence of lagging behavior**. Nowhere in the dataset does search volume follow price action in a **delayed fashion**. If anything, **elevated search interest** appears to **precede demand** and signal **latent curiosity** that becomes capitalized once a catalyst justifies it.

From a **behavioral standpoint**, this makes sense. People don’t search **after buying**—they search **before**. Google Trends is a window into **narrative exploration** and **readiness**. It shows when a name is being examined by **new eyes**. That matters in **small-float biotech names**, where **awareness precedes liquidity**, and **liquidity precedes volatility**.

From a **statistical standpoint**, if we were to model this using **cross-correlation analysis** or **Granger causality tests**, we would likely find **positive lead coefficients**—suggesting that spikes in search interest hold **predictive power** for near-term price action.

From a **market structure lens**, it’s also worth noting that increased search activity often correlates with **upcoming volatility clusters**—especially in **low-float or catalyst-driven names**. When Google Trends moves **independently of price** (as it did in September and May), it signals that **attention is building faster than price is adjusting**, which is often the **precursor to a sharp move**.

**In sum**: while it’s not perfect, Google Trends appears to be a **front-of-wave indicator** in the $ATYR setup—more **behavioral** than **mechanical**, but **valuable** when paired with **fundamental and structural analysis**. In a reflexive system where **visibility fuels action**, and **action fuels more visibility**, tracking interest formation before capital deployment is not only **useful**—it may be **essential**.

## So What? Why This Matters

In my view, Google Trends helps illuminate a **critical retail behavioral layer** that’s often invisible to institutional investors—but **increasingly relevant** in an age where **capital formation is narrative-led**. In a market where **discovery precedes price action**, and where retail can act as both **amplifier** and **shock absorber**, tracking when and how attention forms is **essential**.

We’re seeing:

- **Clear evidence** that retail attention is forming in response to **science**, not hype  
- A **strong correlation** between search interest and **price inflections**—often with search **leading**  
- **Early signals** of retail re-engagement even during **price suppression phases** (e.g., shorting)  
- A recognizable **reflexive loop**: visibility → curiosity → price → visibility  

This isn’t just about identifying **rising curiosity**. It’s about understanding **market posture**: the **divergence** between attention and price often precedes **dislocations**. In biotech, where **asymmetric upside** depends on being **early to narrative ignition**, this matters.

This isn’t a **meme stock**. This is a **low-float, data-rich, clinically validated, institutionally supported company** with a platform that is **only now being discovered** by the broader market. Google Trends is **not the thesis**—it’s a **proxy** for how quickly that thesis is being noticed.

If **Q3 catalysts** land cleanly, and Google Trends **spikes again**, we could be looking at the **inflection point** where **under-the-radar becomes unignorable**—and where **retail and institutional demand converge** on a float that simply **can’t handle it**. And search interest helps us **map that journey**.

If **Q3 catalysts** land cleanly, and Google Trends **spikes again**, it could signal a **third wave of capital deployment**—this time from a **much larger audience**.

1kyxw98,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1kyxw98/the_divorce_prescription_novel_celine_tate_found/,"""The Divorce Prescription Novel""- Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.","Chapter 1

Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.

The other woman was a college student.

Today was Adam's birthday. Celine had spent the whole day preparing a special dinner for him. Just then, his forgotten phone buzzed with a text.

She picked it up and saw a message from the college student. ""I fell while grabbing the cake. It hurts so much… Sobs…""

Attached was a photo—no face, just legs.

The woman wore pulled-up white socks with black round-toed shoes. She pulled up her blue-and-white skirt just enough to reveal her long, flawless legs.

Her fair knees were visibly reddened from the fall. The youthful vibrancy of her figure, paired with her coy words, carried an air of forbidden allure.

Rumor had it that wealthy businessmen tend to favor this type when choosing a lover.

Celine's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Soon, another message came. ""Mr. Alvarez, meet me at Elysian Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday.""

It was Adam's birthday, and his mistress had planned a celebration for him.

Grabbing her handbag, Celine headed straight for Elysian Hotel. She had to see this woman with her own eyes.

…

When Celine arrived at the hotel, she was ready to storm in.

But before she could, she spotted her parents, Hayden Tate and Lucy Garcia. Shocked, she approached them. ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""

The two froze for a moment before exchanging glances. Their eyes flickered as they said, ""Oh, Celine, your sister's back from abroad. We came here to drop her off.""

Carly Tate?

Through the gleaming floor-to-ceiling window, Celine spotted Carly inside. She froze instantly.

Inside, Carly was wearing the same blue-and-white skirt from the photo. So, the college girl was her sister.

Carly had always been a stunner, hailed as Mercity's ""Scarlet Rose"". Her legs, in particular, were the stuff of legends. They were the most beautiful in all of Mercity. Men practically worshiped her.

Now, those famous legs had ensnared Adam.

Celine almost laughed at the absurdity of it. She turned to her parents. ""So I'm the last to find out.""

Hayden's face twisted awkwardly. ""Celine, Mr. Alvarez never liked you.""

Lucy chimed in, ""Exactly. Do you know how many women in Mercity would kill to be with him? Better your sister than some stranger.""

Upon hearing that, Celine clenched her fists. ""I'm your daughter too!""

With that, she spun on her heels to leave.

Just then, Lucy's voice rang out behind her. ""Celine, tell me something. Has Mr. Alvarez ever touched you?""

Celine froze mid-step.

Hayden said sharply, ""Don't act like we owe you anything. Back then, Mr. Alvarez and Carly were the It couple in everyone's eyes. We only asked you to marry him on Carly's behalf after he fell into a coma from the car accident.""

Lucy gave Celine a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Celine. Three years as a housewife, running around after your husband. Meanwhile, Carly's a lead ballerina now—a true swan. You? You're just a frumpy little duckling. Be reasonable and give Mr. Alvarez back to Carly.""

Those words felt like a knife to Celine's heart. She blinked back her tears and turned to walk away.

…

By the time Celine returned to the villa, it was already dark. She had given the housekeeper, Sofia Dotson, the day off. The house was empty, with no lights on, leaving it cold and desolate.

Celine sat alone at the dining table in the darkness.

The table was set with a feast, but the food had long gone cold. Her homemade cake sat untouched, with the words ""Happy Birthday, honey"" scrawled across it.

Celine stared at it, her eyes stinging. It all felt like a cruel joke, just like her life.

Adam and Carly had always been the It couple in their circle. Everyone knew that Carly, the Scarlet Rose, was Adam's heart and soul. But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Adam in a coma, and Carly vanished without a trace.

The Tate family had brought Celine from the countryside and forced her to marry the comatose Adam.

When she found out that the man lying in that hospital bed was Adam—the man she had always loved—she didn't hesitate. She married him without a second thought.

After the wedding, Adam remained in a coma for three years. During that time, Celine took care of him tirelessly, never leaving his side. She gave up going out and socializing. Her sole focus was on his recovery.

She became a housewife dedicated to nothing but him. In the end, her devotion brought him back to life.

Celine lit the candles on the cake with a flick of the lighter.

The dim glow flickered, casting her reflection in the mirror in front of her. She looked at herself—the housewife in her dull black-and-white dress. She was lifeless, boring, and unremarkable.

Meanwhile, Carly had flourished into a lead ballerina. She was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Celine was the ugly duckling, while Carly was the swan.

After waking, Adam had abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the swan.

So, her sacrifice for the last three years had been for nothing.

Adam didn't love her, but she loved him with all her heart.

It was said that the one who fell in love first was always the loser in the relationship. And today, Adam had made her lose everything.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she blew out the candles. The house plunged back into darkness.

Just then, headlights pierced the night as Adam's Rolls-Royce Phantom sped up the driveway and parked on the driveway.

Celine's heart skipped a beat. He was back. She had thought he wouldn't return home tonight.

Soon, the villa's front door swung open. A tall, handsome figure stepped into view, bringing with him the chill of the night air. Adam was home.

The Alvarez family had long been royalty in Mercity. Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family, had been a business prodigy since childhood.

By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from the prestigious Haffard University. By the time he reached adulthood, his first company had made waves on Finance Street. Now, he sat at the helm of Alvarez Group, crowned as Mercity's wealthiest man.

Adam strode in with his long legs. His voice was low and pleasant but distant. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""

With a flick of his hand, he turned on the wall light.

The harsh light made Celine squint. When she opened her eyes again, she looked at Adam.

He was wearing a hand-tailored black suit, every inch the picture of perfection. His perfect proportions and regal air made him the object of desire for many women.

Celine glanced at him. ""It's your birthday.""

Adam's face was a mask of indifference. His eyes lazily swept over the table. ""Don't waste your time. I don't celebrate birthdays.""

Celine sneered and asked, ""You don't celebrate birthdays, or you just don't want to celebrate it with me?""

Adam barely spared her a glance, as if he didn't want to waste time on her. ""Think whatever you want.""

Without another word, he turned and started toward the stairs.

This had always been their dynamic. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get close to him.

Celine stood up and. Looking at his indifferent back, she said, ""Today is your birthday. I'd like to give you a birthday gift.""

Adam didn't stop or turn to look at her. ""I don't need it.""

Celine smiled again. ""Let's get a divorce, Adam.""

Adam had already placed one foot on the stairs when he suddenly paused. He spun on his heel, his deep eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Celine looked at Adam. Her voice was soft but unwavering as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Adam. Do you like this birthday gift?""

Adam's expression remained indifferent. ""Are you suddenly asking for a divorce because I didn't spend my birthday with you?""

""Carly's back, isn't she?"" Celine asked.

At the mention of Carly, Adam's lips curled into a sneer. He stepped toward Celine with long strides. ""Are you bothered by her?""

As the youngest business mogul in Mercity, Adam exuded a powerful presence built from his wealth, status, and influence. As he advanced toward her, Celine instinctively took a step back. Her delicate back hit the wall.

At that moment, the world around her seemed to darken. Adam had already closed the distance, placing one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his solid chest and the wall.

He looked down at her with a mocking smile. ""Everyone in Mercity knows that Carly is the one I'm going to marry. Didn't you know that when you schemed to become my wife? You didn't mind back then, so why are you bothered now?""

Celine's face turned pale.

Yes, Adam was supposed to marry Carly. If it weren't for the accident, she would never have had the chance to marry him.

She would never forget the day he woke up. When he saw it was Celine beside him, the disappointment and coldness in his eyes were unmistakable.

Since then, they had slept in separate rooms, and he had never touched her.

He loved Carly.

Celine had always known that, but…

She looked deeply at Adam's face. Slowly, it began to merge with the image of the youthful boy he had once been.

""Adam, do you really not remember me?"" Celine thought.

It seemed that only she had stayed in the past.

Never mind. She would take these three years as her fulfilling her misguided love.

Celine pushed down the bitterness and pain in her heart. ""Adam, let's end this platonic marriage.""

Adam suddenly raised an eyebrow. ""Platonic?"" His deep voice was full of mockery.

He reached out and cupped her chin. His thumb brushed over her soft lips, pressing against them in an almost teasing motion. ""So that's why you want a divorce? You want to have sex?""

Celine's face flushed bright red, like a tomato.

That wasn't what she meant.

Now, his thumb was pressed on her crimson lips, rubbing with a malicious yet seductive force. Celine hadn't expected such a flirtatious side from a man so hot and refined.

He was actually playing with her lips with his finger.

Adam had never been this close to Celine before. She always hid behind those oversized black-framed glasses, wearing plain clothes, making herself look like an older woman.

But up close, Adam noticed how small her face was. Beneath those glasses, her features were delicate and striking, and those eyes were mesmerizing.

Her lips were soft, too.

Where his finger pressed, the red faded for a moment, then returned with a slight bounce. Her lips were not just soft but tender as well. It was an enticing sight that made him want to kiss her.

Adam's eyes darkened. ""I didn't expect you to have such strong desires. Do you long for a man in you?""

Suddenly, a loud slap echoed in the villa. Celine had slapped him hard across the face.

Adam's head jerked to the side.

Celine's fingers trembled with anger. She had been too humble in her love, allowing her heart to be trampled. How dare he humiliate her like this?

Furious, she said, ""I know you've never let go of Carly. Now I'll make it easier for you. I'll return the position as Mrs. Alvarez to her!""

Adam's expression instantly turned icy, like a sheet of frost had fallen over his handsome face. He had never been slapped before—not by anyone.

He stared at her coldly. ""Celine, you thought you could just marry me when you wanted and divorce me when you felt like it? What do you take me for?""

Celine sneered. ""A plaything, of course.""

Adam couldn't believe what he heard.

Celine fought back the pain in her heart and lied, ""You're just a plaything I took from Carly. Now I'm tired of playing with you. I want to throw you away.""

Adam's expression grew darker. ""Fine, Celine. You want a divorce? Alright. But don't come crawling back to me, begging to get back together!""

With that, he stormed upstairs and slammed the door to his study.

Celine seemed to lose all her strength. Her delicate body slowly slid down the wall. She crouched on the carpet, wrapping her arms around herself.

""I won't love you anymore, Adam,"" she swore in her mind.

…

The next morning, Sofia entered Adam's study.

Adam sat at his desk, reviewing documents. He was well-known for being a workaholic.

""Mr. Alvarez,"" Sofia called out.

Adam didn't look up. Sofia could tell that he was in a bad mood. The air around him seemed to freeze.

She carefully placed a cup of coffee on the table. ""Mr. Alvarez, Mrs. Alvarez made this cup of coffee for you.""

Adam's hand holding the pen faltered. The cold expression on his face softened slightly.

Was Celine trying to make peace?

To be fair, she was a good wife. She cooked according to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and took care of every detail of his daily life.

Adam picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip.

Celine definitely made this. It was exactly how he liked it.

Still, he was angry. She had slapped him last night, and that anger would not be easily soothed. A cup of coffee wasn't going to fix this.

Adam asked, ""Did Celine realize her mistake?""

Sofia looked at him with a strange look. ""…Mrs. Alvarez has left.""

Adam froze, his eyes snapping up to meet Sofia's.

Just then, she took something out. ""She left with her suitcase, Mr. Alvarez. She asked me to give this to you before she left.""

As Adam took the paper and opened it, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" jumped out at him.

Adam was left speechless. He had thought she was trying to make peace.

Sofia hesitated. ""Mrs. Alvarez said you should finish the coffee and sign the papers as soon as possible.""

Adam glared at the cup of coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

Sofia thought he was enjoying the coffee earlier. Why didn't he like it anymore?

However, she didn't dare voice her thoughts. She quickly grabbed the coffee and left the room.

Adam's face darkened. He scanned the divorce agreement and realized Celine agreed to leave with nothing—no alimony, no property.

He sneered bitterly. She certainly had some nerve. She didn't want a single dime from him. What could a country girl like her possibly expect to live on without money?

He remembered how, three years ago, she had done everything she could to become his wife. Wasn't it all about the money?

Then his gaze fell on the reason for the divorce written by Celine in neat handwriting. ""The husband's health does not allow him to fulfill his marital duties.""

Adam was rendered speechless. His face flushed with rage.

This damned woman!

He grabbed his phone and immediately dialed Celine's number.

The phone rang a few times before her clear, calm voice came through. ""Hello?""

Chapter 3

Adam pressed his thin lips into a hard line. ""Celine Tate, get back here now!""

Celine chuckled. ""You want me to come back just because you say so? We're divorced, Adam. I'm not going to put up with you anymore.""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""I'm giving you one more chance to rewrite the reason for the divorce.""

Celine's smile widened. ""Is there something wrong with what I wrote? You've been awake for half a year now, but in all this time, you haven't even held my hand.

""You were in a coma for three years. Although your health seems fine now, I seriously doubt your manhood is working. You should see a doctor. I sincerely hope you can regain your masculinity soon!""

Adam was speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly pulsing.

This woman had really lost it!

""I'll show you how capable I am in bed one day, Celine Tate!"" he gritted out.

""Sorry, you don't have that chance anymore.""

""Celine!""

A couple of beeps sounded, and the call was abruptly disconnected.

Adam seethed in rage. But before he could vent, all he heard was the busy tone.

Celine Tate!

…

Celine had already arrived at her best friend, Robin Smith's apartment.

When she hung up, Robin burst into laughter and gave her a thumbs-up. ""That was perfect, Celine! He's probably so mad right now he might burst a vein.""

Celine felt that it was because she had been too humble in the past that he had come to see himself as so superior.

People should love themselves before loving others. It was crucial to prioritize one's happiness.

Robin added, ""When Carly found out Mr. Alvarez was in a coma three years ago, she left him right away. But now that he's awake, he's going after her again. Honestly, it's better to be rid of a man like him.""

Celine unwrapped a piece of candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweet taste seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""Robin, that's the difference between being loved and unloved.""

The one who was loved could act without fear, while the one who was unloved always remained cautious and insecure.

Robin glanced at Celine, who had already eaten a whole bunch of candies. She pulled Celine to her feet. ""Cheer up, Celine! When you let go of one tree, you'll realize you've gained a whole forest. I'll hire eight escorts and throw you a singles' party tonight!""

Celine laughed, pressing her forehead.

At that moment, Robin reached up and took off Celine's black-framed glasses. She tossed them straight into the trash.

""My glasses!"" Celine went to retrieve them.

Robin stopped her. ""Celine, you're too used to wearing those glasses from all your academic work. You should learn from Carly and dress yourself up beautifully.""

Celine remembered how her parents called her an ugly duckling while Carly was the swan.

It seemed that it wasn't just her parents who thought so. Adam probably saw her as an ugly duckling too.

Robin pulled Celine out the door. ""Come on. I'm taking you out for a full makeover—hair, nails, outfit, everything. I want Adam and the others to open their eyes and see just how beautiful you are!""

As they were leaving, Robin suddenly remembered something. ""By the way, Celine, you really don't want any of Mr. Alvarez's money?""

""I have my own money,"" Celine replied.

""Well, then you're leaving that money to Carly. She'll probably thank you.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

""Where's the card Mr. Alvarez gave you?""

Adam had always been generous and had given Celine a gold-plated black card, but she'd never used it.

Celine pulled the card out of her purse and said with a wink, ""Mr. Alvarez can foot the bill for our shopping today.""

…

Club 1996 had long been the playground for the wealthy elite of Mercity, where the rich heirs and socialites spent their money without a second thought.

That night, the DJ kept the music going, and the crowd danced wildly.

In one of the luxurious booths, Adam sat in the center, wearing a black shirt and black pants. His sleeves were rolled up to reveal his muscular forearms and a watch worth millions. He looked every bit the hot, aristocratic figure that had women in the club constantly looking his way.

Sitting beside him was his good friend, Benjamin Goodwin—the heir to the Goodwin family—along with a few other trust fund babies.

Benjamin laughed loudly. ""What's this I hear, Adam? Celine wants a divorce?""

The others joined in the laughter.

""Who doesn't know how much Celine is in love with you, Mr. Alvarez? She even wanted to marry you when you were in a coma,"" one of them said. ""There's no way she'd leave you now!""

""We should make a bet to see how many days Celine can resist before reaching out to Mr. Alvarez,"" another chimed in.

Benjamin said, ""I bet she won't even last a day. She'll probably send Adam a message any minute now. Haha!""

Adam's face, however, was shadowed and stern, showing clear signs of anger. He pulled out his phone and opened his chat with Celine.

The last message was from the night before. Celine had sent him a picture of a bowl of chicken bone broth with the message, ""Honey, even though your bone density is fine now, you still need to drink more chicken bone broth. Remember to come home early.""

As he scrolled up, there were daily messages from Celine. He had never replied. Not once.

But tonight, there was nothing from her, and Adam felt a surge of frustration in his chest.

Just then, a notification pinged, signaling the arrival of a new message.

Benjamin immediately chimed in, ""I knew it! Celine's messaging Adam right now!""

The notification pinged repeatedly as several messages came through in quick succession.

Everyone burst out laughing. ""I knew Celine couldn't hold back, but I didn't expect her to be so eager.""

Benjamin urged, ""Adam, quick, check what she's saying. She must be crying and begging you to get back together with her.""

Adam's eyes twitched. She had messaged him?

If she wanted to make peace, why all that hostility earlier? Wasn't she the one acting tough this morning?

The moment Adam opened the message, he froze.

Benjamin read it aloud. ""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 dollars at Dazzling Nails.""

Everyone went silent, staring in confusion.

Adam scrolled up and saw a series of transaction messages.

Celine had spent two thousand dollars at Urban Glow Salon, 86 thousand dollars at Chanel, and 24 thousand dollars at Louis Vuitton.

There were no messages asking for reconciliation, just notifications of her spending.

The group was dumbfounded. It felt like Celine had slapped them all across the face.

Adam's face darkened as he slammed his phone onto the table. It wasn't the money that bothered him. It was that she had gone straight to spend his money after their divorce.

The woman who had been so obedient and dependent on him for the past three years suddenly seemed to have shown her true colors.

Benjamin muttered, ""What's she playing at, Adam? She's getting her nails and hair done and went shopping for clothes. Is she trying to dress up like Carly?""

""Carly's the Scarlet Rose of Mercity, while Celine is just some country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll never match up to her.""

""A swan is a swan, and an ugly duckling will forever be an ugly duckling. It will never turn into a swan.""

The group continued laughing at Celine.

At that moment, a commotion broke out in the club. Everyone's attention was focused on one place.

Someone gasped, ""You guys, look! An angel!""

Chapter 4

Celine had arrived.

After a full day of splurging at the mall, Robin whisked her off to Club 1996 for the ultimate single-woman celebration.

What Celine didn't expect was to run into Adam and his group. Naturally, she also heard their mocking remarks about her.

She recognized the people in the luxurious booth. They were part of Adam's social circle. Benjamin, in particular, was one of Adam's closest friends.

Back when Adam and Carly had their high-profile romance, everyone in the group adored Carly. Benjamin even treated her like Adam's wife.

In the past three years, Celine had never been able to integrate into their group. They made no effort to hide their disdain for her.

They'd slapped labels on her like ""desperate replacement bride"", ""ugly duckling"", and ""country bumpkin"".

When a man didn't love her partner, his friends wouldn't respect her either.

Robin's temper flared immediately. ""I'm going to tear their smug faces off!"" She started rolling up her sleeves.

Celine grabbed her arm firmly. ""Let it go, Robin. I'm divorced now. They're not worth the energy.""

Noticing Celine's calm and indifferent demeanor, Robin managed to rein in her frustration. As more and more eyes turned to Celine, calling her an angel, Robin's mood brightened. ""Let's go. Time for a singles party!""

Robin marched them to a luxury booth on the other side of the club. She waved her hand dramatically. ""Bring me all your male escorts!""

Back at Adam's booth, Benjamin and the other scions were still mocking Celine when they suddenly felt a sharp, icy gaze land on them.

They looked up to see Adam at the head of the booth, lazily lifting his sharp eyes to glance at them. His gaze was cold, displeased, and full of warning.

At once, the laughter froze on their faces. None of them dared to say another word about Celine.

Benjamin glanced at Adam. Even though Adam had never spared Celine a second look, she had tirelessly taken care of him for three years. Clearly, Adam still had some shred of sentiment left for her.

Just then, a wave of excitement rippled through the crowd. ""Such a beautiful angel!""

Angel? Where?

Benjamin followed everyone's gaze and immediately widened his eyes in surprise. ""Holy crap! That really is an angel!""

The others around him were equally mesmerized. ""When did an angel arrive in Mercity? And how come we've never seen her before?""

Benjamin tugged at Adam's sleeve. ""Adam, look at that angel!""

Adam was no stranger to women. He'd seen all types, from slender to curvy, so he wasn't interested in that ""angel"".

However, Celine's booth was directly across from his. The moment he looked up, his eyes landed on her.

Celine had ditched her thick-rimmed glasses, shedding her usual dullness and rigidity. Her tiny face was as fair as snow. Her naturally striking features exuded a fresh, otherworldly elegance. With her silky hair cascading over her shoulders, she looked like a living, breathing angel.

Adam's gaze lingered for two full seconds.

Benjamin was clearly thrilled. ""What do you think of that angel, Adam?""

One of the scions remarked, ""Mr. Alvarez won't be impressed. His type is more of a sweet beauty like Carly, not this cool, angelic vibe.""

""Yeah, but check out her legs! Those could definitely compete with Carly's,"" another added.

Celine, in a rare departure from her usual conservative style, was wearing a chic, short tweed dress that showed off her legs for the first time.

Her legs were perfectly toned, proportionate, and tantalizing. These were the kind of legs that made men's imaginations run wild. They were just as captivating as Carly's.

Adam glanced at the ""angel"" for two seconds and couldn't shake the feeling that this woman looked strangely familiar. He felt like he had seen her somewhere before.

Just then, a group of male escorts filed into the room, each one tall and hot. They lined up right in front of Celine.

Robin grinned. ""Celine, pick eight.""

Since Celine was celebrating her newfound freedom from a disastrous marriage, she decided to go all out. ""You, you, you… Stay.""

Benjamin was counting under his breath. ""One, two, three… eight. Did she just pick eight escorts at once?""

One of the scions chimed in, ""Why spend the money? All she has to do is ask, and we'd happily volunteer for free.""

Laughter erupted around the booth.

At this moment, Adam's phone buzzed again. It was a new transaction message. He picked it up to see what Celine paid for this time.

But this time…

""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 500,000 dollars at Club 1996 for eight escorts.""

Adam frowned at once. He reread the words ""eight escorts"" twice before snapping his gaze back toward the angel across the room.

The angel who had just splurged on eight escorts was actually Celine!

Adam was rendered speechless.

Eight escorts surrounded Celine and started pouring drinks for her one after another. ""Ladies, let's play a drinking game.""

Robin happily replied, ""Hell yeah! Let's do it!""

Celine lost the first round. An escort leaned in and held a glass to her lips. ""Here, let me help you drink.""

She took the drink, but the other escorts weren't having it. ""Why him? You drank his drink but not ours? Let us feed you too!""

Celine was feeling a little overwhelmed by the eager attention.

Across the room, Adam's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously. His chiseled jaw tightened as he stood and headed straight for Celine's booth.

Benjamin was taken aback. ""Adam! Where are you going?""

Celine was sipping her drink when a strong, defined hand reached over and grabbed her delicate wrist. He lifted her off the couch as easily as if she were a child.

Shocked, she looked up and was met with Adam's handsome face.

Celine froze for a moment, then quickly struggled to pull her wrist free from his grip. ""Let go of me, Adam!""

Adam's face was cold as he forcefully dragged her away.

Robin jumped to her feet. ""Hey! Adam! What are you doing? Let go of Celine!""

Benjamin and the scions who followed Adam were stunned, their faces filled with disbelief. They all wondered if they were hearing things.

""Celine? The angel is… Celine?""

""Is this the same Celine we've always known? The ugly duckling? She's actually gorgeous?""

Benjamin froze in place as he watched Adam drag the stunning figure away. ""Damn… Celine turned into a freaking angel the moment she ditched Adam.""

…

Adam's grip on Celine's wrist was unyielding. His strong hand was like an iron shackle. No matter how hard she fought, she couldn't break free. His long strides forced her to stumble along behind him.

""Let go of me, Adam!"" she shouted.

Just then, Adam swung his hand, and Celine's delicate back slammed into the cold wall. Her vision went dark as his tall, imposing figure pressed in, trapping her against the wall.

Danger flared in his eyes as he growled, ""Do you think I'm dead, Celine Tate? You're actually out here flirting with other men?""

Chapter 5

Celine frowned. ""What do you mean by flirting?""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""You're dressing like a slut!""

What? A slut?

""You better explain, Adam Alvarez!"" Celine snapped.

Adam lowered his gaze, eyeing her short dress. ""Your thighs are practically hanging out. Is that how desperate you are for people to look at your legs?""

Sure, her dress was a little on the shorter side, but Robin had chosen the dress for her.

She had said, ""You never show your legs, giving Carly the chance to flaunt hers. Tonight, let's show everyone who really has the best legs in Mercity.""

Celine raised an eyebrow. ""Seems like you were looking at my legs, Mr. Alvarez.""

Adam froze.

Celine leaned back against the wall, her posture lazy yet elegant. She slowly lifted her right leg and brushed her crystal heel against his ankle.

Adam stood there in tailored black slacks that highlighted his long legs, exuding an air of cold elegance and restraint.

From his ankle, Celine slowly trailed upward along his calf in a teasing, deliberate motion. It was both a seduction and a provocation.

Adam gave her a cold look. ""What are you doing?""

Celine smirked. ""Mr. Alvarez, whose legs do you prefer—mine or Carly's?""

Adam's gaze lingered on her, captivated by the delicate features of her face, which radiated an almost ethereal beauty. She looked like an otherworldly angel, yet here she was, boldly tempting him.

He'd noticed her beauty last night, hidden behind those black-framed glasses, but he hadn't expected her to be so striking.

However, there was something familiar about her face.

Celine's bright eyes sparkled with mischief. ""Has Carly ever tried to seduce you with her legs, Mr. Alvarez?""

Adam's breath hitched. He leaned closer to look at her. ""Celine, are you really such a slut? You think about men all day and even hired eight escorts!""

He avoided answering her question about Carly. That was perhaps the most polite way for a man to protect a woman.

His relationship with Carly had been a grand love story from their youthful, carefree days. Carly must have seduced him at some point. That was the only way to explain why she lingered so vividly in his memory.

Carly was truly blessed to have such a cold-hearted man remain devoted to her for so long. Adam must have never used a word like ""slut"" to describe her.

Though Celine was smiling, her eyes remained as cold as ice. ""Yes, Mr. Alvarez. There's an issue with your manhood. Since you can't satisfy me, I have to go find someone healthy. Let's get divorced already. If one man doesn't work, I'll find another who does.""

She said he had issues again! This woman was unbelievable!

Adam gripped her delicate jaw. ""Is this some sort of provocation? Are you so desperate to find out if I have issues?""

What?

Celine froze.

Adam leaned in close, his lips hovering near hers with an almost teasing proximity. Yet his words were icy and detached. ""Don't kid yourself, Celine. I'll never touch you. The one I love is Carly.""

The one he loved was Carly.

He didn't even need to say it. Celine already knew. Still, hearing it stung her heart. It wasn't a sharp pain, but a dull, relentless ache that spread in countless tiny waves.

Just then, a sweet voice rang out. ""Adam.""

Celine looked up only to see Carly standing there.

Carly, the renowned Scarlet Rose of Mercity, was a beauty with ruby lips and pearly teeth. Years of dance training had given her a graceful, supple figure.

Seeing her, Adam instantly released Celine and strode toward Carly. He lowered his gaze to meet hers. His eyes were filled with a warmth Celine had never seen before. ""You're here!""

Carly nodded before glancing at Celine. ""And this is?"" Carly didn't recognize her at all.

But Celine would never forget Carly.

The truth was, Celine and Carly were neither full nor half-sisters. Hayden wasn't Celine's biological father. He was her stepfather.

Once, Celine had a happy family. Her father, Aaron Tate, and her mother, Lucy Garcia, had been devoted to each other.

Aaron loved her dearly. He would lift her high into the air every day. ""My little Celine is going to grow up so happy.""

Then, one day, he was gone. His brother, Hayden, moved in with his daughter, Carly, into Aaron's house, and Lucy became Carly's mother as well.

Lucy remarried Celine's uncle. From then on, her affection was directed solely toward Carly, not Celine.

When Carly scored 99 on an exam and Celine scored 100, Lucy punished her. ""Why can't you let Carly shine? Do you always have to outdo her?""

When Carly fell ill, her hair was shaved off for chemotherapy. She cried that she looked ugly. Lucy immediately shaved Celine's head. ""You need to become ugly with Carly. That way, she'll stop crying.""

Night after night, Lucy, Hayden, and Carly would cuddle together, their laughter spilling out into the hallway. Celine would stand outside, crying while clutching the doll that Aaron had bought her. ""Mommy, I'm scared.""

Eventually, Carly started calling Lucy ""Mommy"". Lucy was thrilled, but Carly said, ""Mommy, you can only have one daughter.""

On a rainy day, Lucy drove Celine to the countryside and left her there.

Little Celine chased the car while sobbing. ""Don't leave me, Mommy! I'll be a good girl. I'll listen to you. I'll let Carly have everything! I want a hug, Mommy! I'm scared!""

Clutching her doll, she fell heavily into the mud. She watched helplessly as Lucy drove away, disappearing from her sight.

Celine would never forget Carly.

At this moment, Benjamin rushed over. ""Carly, she's your sister. She's Celine!""

Carly froze in disbelief. ""You're… Celine?""

Celine knew Carly had always looked down on her.

As children, Carly had bested her at every turn. She had always been outstanding. Later, she even dated Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family.

Raised in a life of luxury and affection, Carly became proud and untouchable.

Benjamin was once again stunned by Celine's exquisite beauty. He murmured, ""I didn't expect Celine to look this stunning.""

Carly's childhood memories of Celine were vague because she had never paid much attention to this unloved sister. But wasn't Celine the ugly duckling from the countryside?

Carly stepped closer. Her gaze swept over Celine with thinly veiled disdain. ""Celine, I didn't expect you to doll yourself up like me.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

Well, Carly could think whatever she wanted as long as she was happy.

Celine straightened her slender back and smiled without saying a word. The corridor lights cast a soft glow on her delicate, ethereal face. She was no longer the same little Celine from before.

Just then, Carly spoke up. ""Celine, I heard you and Adam are divorcing. Can't survive without a man, huh? Resorting to male escorts to fill the void? If I were you, I'd get a job.""

Turning to Adam, she added in a condescending tone, ""Adam, Celine has taken care of you for so long. You should at least help her find work. Maybe as a housekeeper.""

Adam's gaze flickered to Celine.

Benjamin interjected, ""Carly, every job requires qualifications. What's Celine's education level?""

Carly seemed to remember something amusing. She raised her chin with a smile and said, ""She dropped out of school when she was 16.""

I know this group is full of Japan enthusiasts, so I figured this would be the perfect place to ask a few questions. I’ve been so caught up finishing the semester and getting everything packed that I haven’t had much time to plan or even feel the excitement yet, but I know this is going to be a great new experience. It’ll be my first time in Asia, and while Japan hasn’t always been at the top of my travel list, I’m getting more and more excited to explore and experience everything once I’m there.

That said, I’d love your tips!

1. Should I buy my train ticket from Narita to the city in advance, or is it easy to just buy it at the station?
2. Are there any other “before you go” things I should take care of?
3. I already downloaded the offline version of Google Translate for Japanese, and I set up the Suica app. Are there other apps you’d recommend for reservations, reviews, or general travel ease?

As for interests, I am hoping if I share a few things I love, folks can help me figure out what to check out based on cool things they’ve done on their trips. 

I’m really into architecture, I love Hokusai and am thinking of trying to see The Great Wave off Kanagawa in person, I’m adventurous when it comes to food, and I’m curious about local beauty products (but I’m on a student budget). I love nature, art, and museums, and honestly, if I can find a good spot to sit with a coffee, people-watch, and read, I’ll be in heaven.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions! :) ",1,1748588490.0,JapanTravelTips,18,0.67,False

Hey fam,
My last post got deleted by r/OMAD mods — but I still want to share this because something finally clicked, and I’m seeing real results for the first time in years.



📊 The Journey

	•	Start Date: April 29
	•	Starting Weight: 140 kg (308 lbs)
	•	Plateau: Stuck at 129 kg (284 lbs) for weeks before finally breaking through
	•	Today (May 30): 126.6 kg (279 lbs)
	•	Total Loss: 13.4 kg (29.5 lbs) overall
	•	Last 15 Days: 10.8 kg (23.8 lbs) gone



🔥 The Protocol That’s Working

	•	OMAD (One Meal A Day), fully keto: eggs, paneer, roasted chicken, butter

	•	Calories: ~1200–1300 kcal/day
	•	Fasting tools:
	•	Coke Zero (sucralose + ace-K) — doesn’t kick me out of keto - Only the days I really feel hungry or family is having something fancy. 
	•	Keto-friendly electrolytes(Days I feel low)
	•	Black coffee (1–2 cups/day)
	•	Macros: ~80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbs (13g net max)

On every Sunday’s now I just order two cheesecakes and devour them only if I hit my projected weight loss goals. 


🧱 Plateau & Breakthrough

I was stuck at 129 kg (284 lbs) for what felt like forever. Constantly bouncing out of keto, regaining water weight, and mentally drained.
What worked? I did a 3.5-day fast (including a 24-hour dry fast), broke it with keto foods, and then locked into strict OMAD + keto from May 25. No more cheat days, no more “just one bite.”



⚔️ Non-Scale Victories

✅ No more slouching — I stand taller, with less belly weighing me down
✅ Skin isn’t puffy anymore — especially chest & stomach
✅ Weigh-ins don’t scare me now — I look forward to seeing progress
✅ Mind is clearer, cravings weaker, and energy feels steadier


🎯 My Goal

I’ve got a trip to meet my online friends on September 26 — I want to be somewhere around 85–90 kg (187–198 lbs).
But honestly, even hitting 100 kg (220 lbs) by August would feel like I’m winning my life back.


Thanks to everyone who shares their stories here.
This time, I actually believe I’ll make it. And I’m not stopping.
Let’s freaking go. 💪

I've been contemplating upgrading from a Breville Barista Pro to a new machine. I've done some research and I was 90% set on pre-ordering a Profitec Ride; it has everything I want except a rotary pump, but it seems the pump on the Ride is still pretty good.

However, I just saw a store sell a Drive (the upgrade model, which \*does\* have a rotary pump) – it's an open box, but the price difference is ridiculous, like only $200 more for the Drive over the Ride.

Mainly I'm now wondering: is there any reason I shouldn't go with the Drive? Is it way overkill? I make one or two lattes daily, I really enjoy the ritual and obviously I love coffee, but I'm also not having 6 cups a day. Is there going to be, for example, a significant difference in terms of maintenance for the Drive which means I'd be regretting it even if it's an amazing deal?

Or, is an open box really something to avoid, even if the machine is completely unused?",1,1748588424.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

The room froze when I saw him kiss her. One second I was hidden in the shadows, and the next my claws were digging into my palms, blood dripping onto the marble floor.

*Control, Ava. You can't shift here.*

I stood in the darkest corner of Moonlight Lodge's ballroom. My champagne tasted like cardboard. Shadow Creek pack was still a mess after our Alpha's death last month. Not the time or place for me to lose control.

Jackson and Sophia swayed on the dance floor. My ex-fated mate couldn't keep his hands off the Silverpeak princess. When she laughed at whatever he whispered, pain shot through my mark.

My neck burned where he'd marked me. Four months ago, he swore we were meant to be. Now he's chasing power instead of love. His plan was simple: marry the Alpha King's daughter, become Shadow Creek's next Alpha. Easy upgrade from dating a nobody like me.

My fangs were already pressing against my lower lip. No amount of breathing exercises would stop this shift if I stayed watching them another minute.

I set down my champagne and made a beeline for the bar. Maybe alcohol could drown the rage before I fully transformed in a room full of elites who'd eat me alive for the entertainment value.

""Double whiskey,"" I growled, not bothering to hide the gravel in my voice. The bartender's eyes widened at what must have been the yellow glow of my irises.

""Make that a Moonlight Martini for the lady,"" a deep voice cut in. ""And the whiskey for me.""

My wolf froze mid-snarl. Just... stopped. Like someone had hit pause on her fury.

I turned and looked up—way up—into eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea. They weren't just looking at me; they were seeing through me.

He wasn't pretty-boy handsome like Jackson. This man's face had character—laugh lines at the corners of his eyes, a slight crease between his brows from frowning too much. Dark hair with silver at the temples. His suit fit him like a second skin, but couldn't hide the raw power underneath.

But his scent—*fuck*. Rain-soaked pine trees, woodsmoke, and something wild that made my wolf sit up and beg. The complete opposite to Jackson's cologne-masked scent that never made my wolf react like this.

""I didn't ask for your input,"" I said, trying to sound tough while my wolf was practically rolling over.

One corner of his mouth kicked up. ""You're about thirty seconds from shifting in a roomful of pack leaders. The drink has wolfsbane extract. It'll help.""

I glanced down at my hands. Claws, not fingernails.

""Whatever,"" I muttered.

The bartender slid over the martini—swirling silver-blue like moonlight on water.

The stranger leaned closer. ""Drink up. Your eyes are giving you away.""

I knocked it back in one go, grimacing at the bitter aftertaste.

""Better?"" he asked, voice so deep I felt it in my chest.

The effect was almost immediate. My wolf settled, claws retracting, teeth returning to normal.

""Thanks,"" I said reluctantly. ""Though I'm not sure why you give a damn if I make a scene.""

His eyes flicked to the dance floor, then back to me with unexpected heat. ""Let's just say I have a soft spot for underdogs.""

Before I could respond, people started moving aside, stepping back to clear a path. For him. The penny dropped.

""You're Blake Morgan,"" I said, my stomach doing a backflip. ""The Silverpeak Alpha.""

*The Alpha King. The one who could destroy every Alpha in the world with a single command.*

My wolf cowered and preened at the same time, a confusing mix.

""And you're wearing a mate mark that's being rejected."" His gaze dropped to my neck where the silver-white mark throbbed. ""Who did that to you?""

The question hung between us. Telling the Alpha King that his future son-in-law had marked and abandoned me seemed like a bad idea.

""Someone who decided power was more attractive than keeping his word,"" I said instead.

His eyes narrowed slightly. ""Your control is slipping again. Come with me.""

It wasn't a suggestion. The words carried the weight of Alpha command, pressing against my will. My wolf, weirdly, didn't mind.

He guided me toward a private elevator, not touching me but close enough that his body heat reached across the inches between us. My skin prickled like I'd stuck my finger in an outlet.

The top floor suite was bigger than my entire house. Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the forest and mountains beyond, silver moonlight pouring across dark furniture.

He went to a cabinet, returning with a glass of water and some dried herbs.

""Chew these,"" he instructed.

I raised an eyebrow. ""You always carry herbs for random werewolves having meltdowns?""

""Only the interesting ones."" Something dangerous flashed in his eyes. ""The mark on your neck—it's making you lose control, isn't it?""

I touched it reflexively, wincing. ""They never covered 'what to do when your fated mate dumps you' in werewolf school.""

""It's strange to see a marked wolf without their mate present."" His voice dropped lower. ""Especially at an event where that mate might be.""

The gears turned behind his eyes. He was connecting the dots—my reaction downstairs, the mark, his daughter's fiancé.

""It's Jackson, isn't it?"" he asked quietly. ""My daughter's fiancé marked you.""

I couldn't speak, but my silence said it all.

""When?""

""Four months ago,"" I said, tasting the bitterness. ""Right before he decided being the next Shadow Creek Alpha was worth more than honoring a fated mate bond.""

Blake's jaw tightened, the only sign that my words hit home. ""And he never tried to break the mark properly?""

""Apparently dumping me in a coffee shop with 'it's not personal, it's politics' counts as closure in his book.""

Blake moved closer, his scent wrapping around me like a warm blanket. My wolf, who should have been cowering before the most powerful Alpha in our world, was instead practically purring.

""May I?"" His fingers hovered near my neck, not quite touching the mark.

I should have said no. This was Sophia's father. Jackson's future father-in-law. But my wolf pressed forward, tilting my head to expose the mark.

When his fingertips brushed my skin, lightning shot through me. His eyes darkened, pupils expanding.

Something flashed in his expression—surprise, confusion, then interest.

Instead of pulling away, he traced the outline of the mark. Heat bloomed from his touch, not the burning pain I'd gotten used to, but something warm and sweet that pooled low in my belly.

I couldn't deny it. My wolf was straining toward him like he was the last steak on earth.

""Why?"" I whispered.

*Why am I reacting to my ex's future father-in-law?*

He shook his head slowly, still touching my neck. ""I don't know what this is. But I want to find out.""

The pull between us grew stronger with each heartbeat. When he finally leaned down, it felt inevitable—his mouth meeting mine with a hunger that matched my own. My hands grabbed his shirt, dragging him closer. His arms wrapped around me, lifting me effortlessly against him.

It was crazy. Completely nuts. He was the father of the woman who'd stolen my mate. The most powerful werewolf alive. And I was nobody—just a Delta's adopted daughter with a worthless mate mark.

My wolf didn't care. She recognized something in him that cut through all that human BS.

Just as his hands slid lower, a voice sliced through my mind:

*Ava... they took your father...*

I gasped, color draining from my face. My mother's voice, shaky and terrified, crashed through our mindlink with an urgency that chilled my blood.",1,1748588148.0,NovelNexus,1,1.0,False
1kyxo5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1kyxo5m/the_albanian_riviera_town_thats_been_a_secret/,🌍 'The Albanian Riviera Town That's Been a Secret Paradise for 50 Years (Until Now)',"Have you ever stumbled upon a destination so captivating and tranquil that it feels like you’ve entered a hidden utopia? 😍 Nestled along the sun-kissed coastline of the Albanian Riviera lies a town that has remained a secret for over 50 years. Emerging now into the limelight, this picturesque gem is ready to be explored by curious globe-trotters like us! 

### Discovering the Enchantment of Dhërmi 🏖️

Dhërmi, a charming seaside town, combines stunning landscapes with an authentic local vibe. With crystal-clear waters bordered by dramatic cliffs and beautiful beaches, it’s no wonder that this town is often referred to as Albania’s best-kept secret. As someone who has visited 50 countries, I can say Dhërmi stands out for its stunning natural beauty and welcoming culture.

#### Best Time to Visit ⏰

If you're planning a trip, try to visit between May and September. The weather is warm, and the beaches are perfect for sunbathing and swimming! However, if you prefer fewer tourists, the shoulder seasons (May and September) offer a great balance of pleasant weather, fewer crowds, and off-peak prices. 

#### Where to Eat and Drink 🍽️

Delve into the local culinary scene by trying out some authentic Albanian dishes. One must-visit spot is ""Taverna Koli"" where you can savor mouthwatering seafood dishes while enjoying panoramic views of the coastline. Don't miss trying the ""tavë kosi,"" a traditional baked dish with yogurt and lamb—it's a taste you won't forget! Pair it with a glass of local ""Shesh i Bardhë"" wine, and you’re in for a treat! 🍷

#### Exploring Beyond the Beach 🌄

While Dhërmi’s beaches are enchanting, don’t limit yourself to just lounging in the sun. Adventure awaits in the nearby Llogara National Park, where you can hike to breathtaking viewpoints that overlook the Adriatic Sea. The hike is moderate, making it accessible for most travelers. Trust me, the views are worth every step! 

### Connecting With the Locals 🤝

One of the best parts of traveling is meeting new people. The locals in Dhërmi are incredibly friendly, always eager to share stories or offer travel tips. Make sure to engage with them, perhaps over coffee at a local café. They can offer insights into hidden spots and traditions that you won’t find in any travel guide!

### A Personal Anecdote 🗺️

During my visit, I wandered off to a quiet cove and met a local fisherman. Over fresh sardines grilled on a makeshift barbecue, we exchanged stories about our lives and cultures. It’s moments like these that make travel truly special and remind us of the beauty of human connections. 

Ready to pack your bags for an unforgettable trip to Dhërmi? Don't forget to share your adventures and experiences when you return! 🌟

I’m 29 years old male and I just recently about 3 weeks ago went through a break up with my ex gf who I lived with and dated for about 6 months, since I’m single I decided to travel to Europe since I’ve never really been and I had some friends in Germany and one of them was this girl I used to see from Costa Rica and we would intimate and sleep together and travel but we never were officially bf/gf. So where I grew up and how I grew up which was by a single mom who was an alcoholic, my dad over dosed on drugs when I was 12 and didn’t have many male role models around I always just thought a man pays for a woman’s dinner and everything else basically, so after my breakup that girl from Costa Rica messages me and we had spoke a little before when me and gf had mini breakups and I said I might travel to Spain and she messages me the day after my breakup and i ask her if she wants to come with me to Spain and she says yes, I pay for her plane ticket from Germany and it’s around 400$ book us the Airbnb which is around 1200$ and pay for a few tours for us which is around 400$ for both of us, we spent a few days together in Germany since I went there after Amsterdam cuz we agreed to fly together and we got good in Germany and she said thank you so much when I booked the tour for us and I made a joke but was serious “your welcome you owe me a coffee” just showing appreciation for all the money I spent since we aren’t bf/gf. She says “yes”. The first time we went to my Airbnb and we did have sex once and about 15 min later I try and have sex again but she says she wants to relax and I’m like okay, so in Germany for those 2 times we hangout we got matcha, dinner twice and I paid for everything. She did attempt to pay for the matcha the first day but they only took cash, so I paid. We then get to Spain and in the taxi she says “we need to talk” and when we get to the Airbnb she says she just wants to he friends and doesn’t feel a connection anymore and doesn’t want sex. I say okay and we talk about it we don’t have sex but now I feel taken advantage of, not because I expect sex from a woman but this girl isn’t my friend we were ex lovers and I thought we would maybe form some type of relationship, I don’t buy plane tickets for friends. I just feel so weird now and stupid, she offered to leave and get her own place but I’m really generous and nice and I say no it’s okay, she did buy dinner today but I still have paid for most things and all the expensive things. I’ve had conversations with people and they said you need to be clear on your intentions or whatever and it’s like I’m not going to tell someone “I want sex” i just thought it would click like it used to, I feel like I try and buy people maybe or a people pleaser, i don’t have much family or can’t get advice from my parents cuz my mom blocked me and is an alcoholic and can’t work and my dads dead, men my age what advice do you have for me?

**Monday:**  
Manual = chaos. Scrambling between five platforms, copy-pasting into slides before the meeting.  
*Automated* = dashboard updates before your first coffee. You walk in already knowing what matters.

**Tuesday:**  
Manual = rechecking formulas, fixing broken cells, redoing yesterday’s work.  
*Automated* = using that time to analyze trends and make smarter decisions.

**Wednesday:**  
Manual = surprise Slack: “Can you pull yesterday’s LinkedIn numbers?”  
*Automated* = reports are already shared and auto-updated. You’re not the bottleneck anymore.

**Thursday:**  
Manual = exporting charts, formatting slides, praying Excel doesn’t crash.  
*Automated* = everything’s built automatically. You use your time to improve the campaign, not document it.

**Friday:**  
Manual = triple-checking before logging off, just in case.

1kyxlur,https://i.redd.it/k3j4ikpd9v3f1.jpeg,Why is this neon yellow powder packet so popular among students? ‘It’s like magic',"


https://archive.is/2024.05.03-222013/https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2024/05/01/waarom-is-dit-neongele-zakje-poeder-zo-populair-onder-studenten-het-is-net-magie-a4197671


Energy Powder Extra Joss , a powder containing mainly caffeine, is increasingly being spotted in nightlife.  ""It’s a cheap product that’s easy to carry and share, but it also has a certain mystique.""



It’s a neon yellow packet with the words *‘EXTRA JOSS’* in bold letters on the front. Inside the packet is four grams of white powder with a slight chemical smell. It’s not sold in supermarkets, yet it’s wildly popular among student association members.  



Emma van Wieren, a 19-year-old commercial economics student in Groningen, was introduced to the powder by a friend who knew about it through her student association. When they go out, they often mix the contents of the packet into a shot of vodka. The moment it hits her glass, the vodka starts foaming and turns almost as neon yellow as the Extra Joss packet.  ""It’s like magic—I promise you’ll get energy from it.""



50 milligrams of caffeine


Bram Lohmeijer, a 22-year-old Technology & Operations Management student in Groningen, knows the powder through his student association: *""I heard about it from other members and use it regularly. When I’m out, I’m exhausted by 2 a.m., but with Extra Joss, I can keep going until 4.""



Where does this eye-catching packet come from? And why is it so popular among student association members? And most importantly—what’s in it that gives users so much energy?  


The ingredient list on the back of the Extra Joss packets reveals that, alongside a range of vitamins, the powder contains 50 milligrams of caffeine. According to the Dutch Nutrition Centre, the amount of caffeine isn’t dangerous.  ""For comparison: a cup of coffee contains about 60 mg of caffeine, and a cup of black tea has around 30 mg.""




A tight-knit network

Marketing expert Groot explains why Extra Joss has become so popular among student association members.  ""It’s cheap, and there’s practically no marketing around Extra Joss. So you can only learn about it through other users. Student associations are very close-knit—if Extra Joss gets passed around there, suddenly everyone in the association knows about it.""

I had my first high school rumour started about me recently and I’ve been out of highschool for almost 4 years now. To clarify I’m a 22F. This is a long one so buckle up.

Anyways the situation starts when I began getting close with this one girl we will call Becky. We began hanging out all the time at the beginning of the year and I’ve always struggled to trust female friendships but she was kind and nice and it was beautiful having her as my friend. We spent a lot of time on the phone, we made time to hangout. And we got published in a magazine together (I’m a photographer and she is a model) it was a perfect example of girlhood for us. 
So fast forward to April 2025, I get an invite to her birthday weekend. Two nights of bar hopping and drinking. Not my typical weekend but still went to support her. In this time I met some of her friends and was kinda adopted into the friend group. There was a schmit show of drama during the weekend. First night her man got kicked out of the club for going all aggro in the smoke pit and throwing/stomping on his disposable vape. Which made everyone immediately get in a bad mood, and Becky really upset. The rest of the night everyone was complaining and her man kept disappearing for an hour at the most and wouldn’t pick up his phone. The night was heading to a house party and I was overstimulated and feeding off of everyone’s energy and just went home instead of going with. This night should have been my sign that shit would not last because I saw a lot of true colours but ignored it because I was under the 🍃 influence and thought I was just being insecure. 
The next night was great and I had a lot of fun, I was mentally prepared for whatever may happen and I thrived just kinda doing my own thing for the most part. So at the end of the night, we went to a field to pop champagne for her birthday and we went back to one of Becky’s friends house, we will call him Adam (idk his age) they live in the same complex. In that hangout I became pretty good friends with a mutual we will call Mark (30M) that I hadn’t really kept in contact with but we bonded over photography and music with. We became pretty fast friends after reconnecting and began hanging out all the time. This will be important later.

So during that last night I began to notice the way Adam treated his girlfriend we will call Kelly, (21F I think) I noticed he was very rough with her and would say some weird ahh things that just set off alarm bells in me, but I was new and didn’t wanna stick my nose in something if I was wrong.
After that night, I would hangout with this friend group almost every night for about 3 weeks, and I’d notice just how actually abusive Adam was to Kelly, and the last night I would go I’d watch him kick her in the face and laugh about it, he’d say horrible things to her about how she’s a wh*re and stupid and just shitty things to say to someone you claim to love. 
So I did something.

One night I got a call from Mark saying the entire friend group had blocked him without any explanation and we’d spend a chunk of the night trying to figure out why they might have done so. 

I called Becky to ask what the heck was happening and she was with them and Adam just started going off about how it’s such a privilege to be apart of their group and if I wanna stay in it I’ll also block Mark. Because he’s this that and other bull poop 

Now I’m a firm believer in if someone tells me to choose between them and someone else I’ll always choose the person who isn’t asking me to choose… 
So as he kept ranting I just hung up the phone because I really didn’t care to be friends with him. He was the worst part of the whole group.

We now believe it’s because Mark tried to get Kelly away from Adam by telling her how he treats her isn’t okay. But at the time of all of this we didn’t know and he was really upset about it and this was my final straw, so I sent the 2 part series that Kayla Malecc made about her experience with DV to Kelly and that’s it. Whomever replied was not Kelly and I have full belief it was Adam texting me acting as if she was her because the stuff being thrown at me was vile and disgusting and not anything she seemed capable of saying. Idk anyways.

During this would be the first time I’m told that Becky started a rumour that me and Mark kissed in his car. We did not, I would never. I have a whole 4 year relationship I would never jeopardize and the biggest issue with it is that I’m very not into age gap relationships and I’m 22 and mark is 30 with a girlfriend. It just wasn’t something that either of us have even thought of. We hung out often at night to do night photography but that was it. This started a whole bunch of shi, because now Marks girlfriend hates me, blames me for his friend group leaving him and thinks he’s cheating with me. My man didn’t believe it, I told him the morning he woke up because they had threatened to text him and I was worried he’d believe it to. But he laughed and said I know you wouldn’t. Which was great. 

I asked Becky about the rumour she explained that she said me and him hung out late at night and that was it, Adam just jumped to conclusions. I took that because it made the most sense and I didn’t wanna lose a friend. So we stayed friends and kept hanging out. Her dad recently passed so I pretty much dropped everything to help her through that in whatever way I could, going for coffee, late night talks with her drunk off her mind, I was there through it all not pressuring her to be okay.

Then our mutual friends got engaged (I was their surprise photographer hehe) and Becky and I were asked to plan the bridal shower for her. So that was a perfect distraction from her grief and we began planning, we were calling or meeting up all the time to plan the best time for our friend we will call her Lexi (20F) 

We also ended up calling Mark after one of our location scouting meetings because it began raining on us and it was a magical night we ended up driving to the mountains and just hanging out while it rained and it was wonderful. It was the first time I felt totally confident that these people might be around for a while. That was a mistake.

It was a Friday night, Mark, myself and my partner were at a car meet and I called Becky to come with her man to join us. She goes ghost on me, and when I see her she has Adam and Kelly with her. I was kinda ticked off because I wanted to hangout with her and knew if I walked up they wouldn’t be nice to me so I just kept my distance. She acted like she didn’t even know me. That’s when my overthinking set in, I got insecure about how she probably doesn’t defend my name when they talk about me with her and just listens to them shit talk me. All the best thoughts. But I let it go, and then she texted me upset about me telling Lexi the location of the bridal shower (I told her because I wasn’t sure how the heck else she’d get there as I don’t know any of the people who are coming nor do I have a way to contact them) and I thought we’d figured it out but she was still being dry with me or just leaving me on read.

Then on Monday I get a text from Lexi. She says she feels like she’s been a bad friend. And I said no because I didn’t know what she was talking about.
But then she told me that on Friday night her and her man ran into Becky and her man at a club and ended up going to hangout with them back at Adam’s house, there she heard Becky and her man going off about how me and Mark are now sleeping around together to Adam and Kelly. And being secretive and whispering stuff. Now it’d had been twice I’d been told Becky started a rumour about me from two different sources and I was upset. So I texted her pretty bluntly, I send her a ss of what I was told with names crossed out and permission from Lexi to do so, and said “Second time I’m being told this so are you really this two faced?”

She of course denied it and then went and started harassing Lexi about it, which was def my fault and I did call Lexi after to apologize for her being put in the middle of the bs.
So Becky stops replying to me, and suddenly her man is requesting to add me on snap, and then requesting to message me on Instagram. He is telling me to drop it because I don’t have my facts straight and it wasn’t about me. And I said it’s my name being brought up so it’s my business. It was a lot of back and forth between until he straight up said “A shots a shot thats all imma say, Drop it if I was you thats for sure” 

I took that as a petty attempt at a threat, told him I’m not scared of some little boy who can’t treat his own woman right and blocked him. I then went to Becky and told her I was done with her, because instead of talking to me she sent her boyfriend to fight her battles for her.

Now here’s where the petty revenge comes in, the other day I was talking to a mutual friend of ours because he had asked if I could shoot his next performance and I asked if Becky would be there so I could mentally prepare. He asked what happened with us so I told him. He then told me it’s crazy she’s starting that about me when on his birthday she was making out with him in a photo booth (he sent me the strip of photos) 
She just hit her 2 year anniversary with her boyfriend…
So, I sent him the photo and said maybe you should focus on your own relationship before starting shi about mine, waited for him to see it and then blocked him again. 

I would’ve sent it to him either way, because he should know he’s being cheated on when he’s not around but it felt a little justified when they were projecting their own shitty relationship onto me.

Anyways that’s my tale, I may have left shi out but I have ss and proof if it’s wanted but yeah, that was my first ever experience with having a rumour started about me and I’m back to having no friends lol it’s okay I don’t want fake people around me anyways.

I love your videos!! Thanks for reading if you did and I’ll maybe update if anything else happens!

The next morning she barges in the hall and accused me of eavesdropping their words, insulting and talking behind her with our landlord and what not. Ruined my birthday 😐😶
Ps. Everything is falsely accused to me as I used to only talk with my boyfriend that time now ex. And was already broken bc of breakup that time and used to spend time drinking with my friends almost every alternate days, so I used to come  home only to sleep.
And yeahh!! That was the breaking point and I simply left after 3 days of hunting pg and never looked their face. ",2,1748586826.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they’d stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.

Naturally, I asked, “*Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?*”

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

>“*Generate a proposal for X company, similar to the one we did for Y — include updated scope and pricing*.”

And then just like that… a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates. 



They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.

Now?

* You can ask questions inside documents, like “What’s missing here?” 
* Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates — even PDFs
* Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations
* Edit documents by prompting the AI like you’re chatting with a teammate
* Turn any AI search result into a full professional document

It’s like **Cursor for documents**. having a smart assistant that understands your documents, legalities and builds new ones based on your real work history. 

The best part? It’s free. You can test it out for your next proposal, agreement, or internal doc and probably cut your writing time in half. (sharing the link in the comments)

Quiet mornings, doing things at my own pace, no social pressure. Group trips? Just the thought of constant interaction used to make me anxious.

But last year, I did something unexpected, I joined a group trip organized by[ Towno](https://towno.in/), a travel company a friend recommended. They’re known for curated group experiences, and I figured, if I ever had to do one, it better be with people who know how to plan it right.

It was a 7-day trip with 8 people, some I knew, most I didn’t. Shared stays, lots of group activities, and zero places to hide (or so I thought).

Here’s how it unfolded:

* **The first two days** were rough. Everyone was chatting, laughing, jumping between activities. As an introvert, it felt like sensory overload. I took short walks alone, just to stay sane.
* **By day three**, things shifted. What I appreciated about the way Towno had organized everything was that the itinerary had breathing room, not everything was go-go-go. I started picking activities I actually liked and skipping the rest without feeling guilty.
* I also met a couple of chill travelers who totally respected boundaries, no “why are you so quiet?” questions. Just genuine, low-pressure conversations.
* **By the end**, I found myself laughing more, joining in naturally, and still carving out solo mornings with coffee and a view. Honestly? I felt stretched, but not broken.

I came home tired, but it was the *good kind* of tired, the kind that tells you you grew a little. I'm still a solo traveler at heart, but now I know that group trips can work, if they’re done right, and with the right kind of people.

So, fellow introverts:  
Ever stepped out of your comfort zone and tried a group trip? Did it go well? Or did it just make you miss solo travel even more?

## key Features Analysis

The modern water dispenser with mini fridge is packed with features designed to enhance user experience and deliver consistent performance.

**Cooling Technology:**

The cooling of both the water and the fridge compartment relies heavily on efficient cooling technology. Moast leading models utilize compressor-based cooling systems for the refrigerator, which are known for their reliability and ability to maintain consistent, low temperatures. Thermoelectric cooling, also known as Peltier cooling, is typically used for chilling the water. These systems are quieter and more energy-efficient for this specific request. Compressor-based systems provide powerful and consistent chilling for the fridge while Peltier cooling efficiently chills the water without excessive noise.

**Water Dispensing Options:**

Many advanced dispensers offer multiple dispensing options, including hot, cold, and room temperature water. Instant hot water features, frequently enough utilizing a separate heating element, are notably useful for making tea, coffee, or instant meals. The cold water reservoir typically holds around 0.5 to 1 gallon, chilled and ready to dispense at temperatures ranging from 35°F to 50°F. This ensures that users have access to a variety of water temperatures to suit their specific needs.

**Mini fridge Capacity and Design:**

The mini fridge compartment is designed to efficiently store beverages, snacks, and small meals. Standard capacities range from 0.5 to 1.7 cubic feet, providing ample space for personal use or a small office environment.

Key features of the best water dispensers with mini fridge include:

* Multi-temperature dispensing
* Adjustable thermostat for refrigerator
* child safety lock for hot water

**Filtration System:**

A key component of any quality water dispenser is its filtration system. Many units use activated carbon filters to remove impurities, chlorine, and unpleasant odors from the water. these filters improve the taste and quality of the water, providing a healthier and more refreshing drinking experience.Filter replacement is typically required every six months, depending on water quality and usage.

**Safety Features:**

Modern water dispensers incorporate several safety features to prevent accidents and ensure user well-being. A child safety lock on the hot water dispenser helps prevent scalding incidents, especially in households with young children. Overheating protection automatically shuts off the heating element if the water temperature becomes excessively high. Durable, food-grade materials are used throughout the unit to prevent contamination and ensure the safety of both the water and the items stored in the refrigerator.

1kyx7o7,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1kyx7o7/i_finally_dealt_with_an_insect_on_my_own_without/,"I finally dealt with an insect on my own without parental help, and I am very happy with myself","So for some context, I have a pretty bad fear of insects, specifically roaches. and I’ve had this fear ever since I was little and unfortunately, I live out in the middle of nowhere so they’re tends to be quite a few of them, especially right around the outside of the house where there’s likely to be food dropped. So occasionally they’ll come inside. For the past few months I’ve done pretty good at keeping them out of the house until one night I discovered one crawling into the house underneath the gap of the front door. this wouldn’t be a big issue if I slept in my room, but I’ve been sleeping on the couch for the past few months because I have been unable to clean it (I’m making progress) so this absolutely horrified me since the couch is right next to the front door. The first time this occurred I tried to kill it by myself, but by the time I got myself psyched up and accepted that my mom wasn’t gonna help me. It was gone, so I just sprayed the underneath of the door and then jammed a cloth underneath it so I could sleep for the night. I searched around for it the next morning and I couldn’t find it so I figured it went out.

For the next few weeks every time just before nightfall, I would stuff a pair of old medical scrub pants underneath the edge of the door, filling both the entirety of the bottom of the door as well as part of the side (kind of like an L shape) so nothing could get in. but I’ve been forgetting to do this for about a week or so and I haven’t really worried about it because I haven’t seen any roaches anywhere. I presumed that they all ran off after I had sprayed and cleaned the outside.  That was until 30 minutes ago while I was on a call with a friend and I walked by the front door, and I looked down only to find a big old roach, the size of my thumb by my feet.

As per usual, I jumped and screamed like a little girl started swearing like a sailor and ran away from it (keep in mind that I am an 18 year old 6 foot tall, semi out of shape man who could easily crush this thing with one simple step)

Anyways, I ran to the kitchen, grab the bug spray and instead of just procrastinating and pacing around being afraid of it, I went right over to where it ran and sprayed . Naturally a few seconds later, it came running out and was completely disoriented so it ended up running towards me so I flipped the fuck out and I ran away and a little bit later. I completely lost track of it. for the next 30 minutes while still on call with the friend, Idid really wacky things to try and find the bug such as using 50 feet of rope to make a lasso to pull the coffee table so I didn’t have to go pull it with my hands (it should be noted that I didn’t unravel the full 50 feet to do this) as well as using an extendable lightbulb pole to turn on light switches and move around things on the floor & other stuff like that. Eventually, my friend gets off the call, but I still haven’t located the roach so I’m dealing with this all by myself now. I keep asking my mom for help but she refuses And by this point I’m getting fed up so I started tiptoeing around the area trying my best to locate it…… and then I found it…. 

Dying.

The bug spray had worked, and the reason I couldn’t find it because it was curled up in a corner of the room slowly taking its last breath 

For anybody else this wouldn’t be anything to write home about but for me, this is the first time I’ve actually killed one of them all by myself without parental help. now, was my method comparable to that of a Looney Tunes character? Perhaps. But did I do it by myself? Yes and I am proud of myself. 

Now the only problem is, I have to clean it up by myself and even dead. They still nerve me, but at the very least I can sleep for one night.  PS this is probably filled with grammatical errors because I used to talk to text to write this and I have dyslexia so proofreading it doesn’t really domuch. :( ",5,1748586290.0,autism,1,1.0,False

I know IATAH But how do i deal with what i read?,"I made this post a few days ago regarding some texts i came accross on my wife's phone. It seemed to get a few comments so i thought i'd provide an update.

The original post is below

[I read messages on my (41M) Wife's (40F) old phone. I know IATAH But how do i deal with what i read? : r/relationship\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kx59co/i_read_messages_on_my_41m_wifes_40f_old_phone_i/)

  
As per the subject, i know I am at fault for reading my Wife's old messages. I was tasked with clearing the apple account on an old device and while doing so i curiously looked at some old texts. Now i know things that i don't know how to move forward from.

For context, my wife (40F) and I (41M) have been together for around 8 years. Prior to our relationship, my wife was married and living in America. I was told her husband had a drinking problem and was an abusive. She returned to Australia after divorcing and we were setup by mutual friends around 4 months later. I was aware at the time that my partner had been on a couple of other dates from a guy who owned a local coffee shop, but apparently the dates fizzled. My wife and I have had a pretty good relationship for the passed 8 years and we have two children together. I have never had reason to be jealous. My Wife always seemed fairly conservative sexually and in the early stages of our relationship i remember it being nearly two months in before we first had sex.

However, with access to the old iPhone I was curious to read how my Wife described me to her friends. I was fairly shocked when reading through the message history from this time period to see that while early into our dating phase my wife was clearly involved sexually in the guy from the coffee shop. Infact, it reads as though this guy was clearly the guy my wife preferred. But she ended up settling for me when his interests didn't seem to go beyond sex. However, the overlap of the obviously sexual relationship goes for around 2 months into a period of time where i would have considered my Wife and I a couple. Comparing dates to text history on my phone, there is one particular date where I had organised dinner during the week. I remember taking her our and dropping her home by 10pm. Around 30 minutes later, she wrote to the coffee shop guy ""Come over?"". He simply responded ""Ok ;)""

I get that this is probably normal in modern dating for people to be juggling a few possible contenders. This is my issue to deal with. But i am certainly surprised at this point.

However, it doesn't end there. It turns out there is an entirely separate thread from another person named Joe, who is based in the US. Around 1 year into the relationship with my Wife. Joe is sending messages professing his love for my Wife. From what i can tell, My Wife and Joe ""Hooked up"" while she was living in the US. This is referred to as one of the main reasons my wife ended up divorcing. As her husband at the time found out. What i read describes a whole different scenario to how my Wife became divorced and moved back to Australia. Despite these messages being 12 months into my relationship with my wife she is clearly very forward with Joe. My wife mentions to him that she wished she could go back in time to when she was still in America. She says to him that if he had been as forward with her back then things would have turned out different. She even says she found him so hot she didn't trust herself around him.

So here I am feeling guilty for having exploited my wife's privacy. I know this was wrong. But now i know what i know and i feel like crap. But i can't even bring it up because the focus would be what an AH i am for reading the messages. Do i just need to accept that we've been together long enough that the things that occurred when the relationship was newer shouldn't affect us going forward?

UPDATE

Ok, so i brought this up with my wife in bed last night. It started out as i expected. She was furious that i'd looked at her messages. I stated that i wasn't proud of this, but its not something i'd ever felt i should do previously and i never expected to read what i did. I'll address what was talked about each issue.

Coffee shop guy

So she acknowledged they did have sex once. However, she said he had no interest in her which is why she proceeded being setup on dates with me. She said that she absolutely did not have sex with him once we started dating but they did remain friends. Apparently, he helped her look for her unit she had purchased and her asking him to come around was to show him the unit. She's adamant they did not have sex again. I have no idea what to believe. However, to add more context to this guy, i could see in the text conversation that it did fizzle out. The small talk conversations did cease altogether about 3 months after I began seeing my wife. Adding to this, Coffee shop guy actually passed away unexpectedly about 2 years later. This was something i was aware of.

As for Joe. My wife recalled him texting her after she had returned to Australia. She stresses they never had sex in America, but she acknowledges she did kiss him which created all the drama with her previous husband. She began saying that when she was responsive to his texts this was before our relationship. I simply mentioned that the texts are time stamped and it was around 10 months into our relationship. I guess the story changed from there to saying that she had low self esteem after her marriage and that this guy was forward to her in a way noone else was. So knowing he was on the other side of the world she flirted back for the validation and confidence boosts. I guess in a way i can accept this. As per the coffee shop guys messages, this message thread also fizzled out. My wife being the one to stop responding. 

I explained how hurt i felt and that i feel like this confirms i really was just 'settled for'. I'm not out to judge someones sexual history. But when you feel like your own partner has never really been particularly forward in a sexual way. Its demoralising to read and know that were previously much more promiscuous 

To answer some other questions raised in the comments.

\- My kids are mine

\-My wife treats me fine and has been a rock for me in our relationship. Some personal circumstances affected me massively at a midpoint in our relationship and she stood by me. As did her family.

\- Despite being surprised at the texts from the very start of our relationship. I do actually believe her when she says she has definitely never been with anyone else since we've formally been a couple.

I know there has been lots of comments suggesting i should simply leave. While alot of damage has been done, it feels hard to consider throwing my life away and resigning to one of shared care with kids and being broke. I appreciate the comments that understand this aspect. Also, i'm 42. I know nothing about the current dating world other than knowing I wouldn't fair very well.

I know alot of the issues going over my head stem from my own feelings of being an inadequate man. I keep fit, but i'm nerdy. I was never that popular with girls and have only had a few sexual partners. I know in the passed my own inadequacies and insecurities have created issues in the relationship. But i guess i feel what i read confirmed/justified how i feel.

1kyx4bi,https://i.redd.it/y85g08cm3v3f1.png,[GUIDE] - How to write content for your website in 2025,"Great content isn’t just blog posts collecting digital dust. Great content gets shared, bookmarked, and most importantly, linked to. It becomes a linkable asset that drives real results.

# What Makes Content “Linkable”?

Think of linkable assets as content with magnetic appeal: stuff that actually helps people solve problems, not just checks SEO boxes. These pieces attract backlinks naturally because they’re genuinely useful, insightful, or demonstrably better than the thousandth recycled listicle floating around.

The best part? You don’t need a massive marketing team or huge budget. You just need to be helpful, a little creative, and willing to share something worth sharing.

**7 Types of Linkable Assets That Drive Results**

***1. Comprehensive How-To Guides***

**Example:** “The Complete Guide to Setting Up Google My Business (2025 Edition)”

Give people step-by-step instructions they can actually follow. Help them *do* something, not just think about it.

***2. Original Data & Customer Insights***

**Example:** “We Asked 100 Local Shoppers What Makes Them Choose One Business Over Another”

Got customer data? That’s gold. Package your insights, and suddenly you’re the authoritative source others want to cite.

***3. Visual Content & Infographics***

**Example:** “Local SEO Explained: Visual Breakdown for Business Owners \[Infographic\]”

Take something complex, make it visual. People love sharing content that makes complicated topics easy to understand.

***4. Free Tools & Resources***

**Example:** “Local SEO ROI Calculator: What’s Your Website Traffic Actually Worth?”

Create something useful and give it away. That’s not just good karma—it’s link-building gold.

***5. Case Studies & Success Stories***

**Example:** “How One Coffee Shop Tripled Foot Traffic Using Instagram Reels”

Nothing proves expertise like real results. Share client wins (with permission) and the specific strategies that worked.

***6. Expert Roundups***

**Example:** “10 Marketing Experts Share Their #1 Growth Tip for Small Businesses”

Can’t create all the insights yourself? Curate them. Interview industry experts (they’ll likely share the content too).

***7. Curated Resource Lists***

**Example:** “15 Essential Free Tools Every Small Business Owner Should Use”

Save people time by doing the research for them. A well-curated list can become the go-to resource in your industry.

# Why This Strategy Works (Especially for Small Businesses)

**Natural Link Building:** No awkward outreach emails. Create genuinely helpful content, and people will want to link to it.

**Authority Building:** Comprehensive guides and original data establish you as the expert, not just another service provider.

**Improved Rankings:** More quality backlinks mean higher search authority and better rankings.

**Social Sharing:** Useful content gets passed around naturally: visuals, tools, and actionable advice spread organically.

**Problem Solving:** When you answer questions people are actually searching for, they find you.

# Real-World Example

Say you run a landscaping business. You create a “Seasonal Lawn Care Checklist for \[Your City\] Homeowners.”

Who might link to it?

* Local home improvement bloggers
* Homeowner community forums
* Real estate agents’ resource pages
* Local news sites covering seasonal topics

That’s content working for you 24/7, earning links while you sleep.

***The Bottom Line***

Linkable assets aren’t about being flashy or keyword-stuffed. They’re about being genuinely useful.

Content-based SEO isn’t dead because no AI can replicate your real experience running a business, solving customer problems, or understanding your local market.

You’ve got the expertise and the stories. Now package them in a way that earns you the links, traffic, and credibility you deserve.

	•	One cup after I reach work, around an hour after breakfast
	•	Another cup an hour or two before lunch
	•	One more after lunch

I dilute it with warm water, but I’m still getting mild stomach pain and acidity. I’ve been drinking it mainly to help manage a fatty liver and because I genuinely enjoy coffee.

I used to have it with milk or almond milk, which didn’t give me this discomfort. But I switched to black for health and calorie reasons.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of issue with multiple black coffees a day? Could this be too much acidity for my system? Any tips on how to reduce the tummy pain while still keeping my coffee routine?",1,1748585884.0,Fitness_India,6,1.0,False
