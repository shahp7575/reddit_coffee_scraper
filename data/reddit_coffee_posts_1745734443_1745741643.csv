About three weeks ago, I went on a date with a man — we met for coffee, and ended up talking for two hours. The connection was immediate. Out of the 20+ dates I’ve been on, I’ve never felt anything like this before. There was a real spark between us. He kissed me afterward and even held my hand. He has a 10-year-old daughter (he shares 50/50 custody), and he’s a surgeon, so his schedule is very busy.

Even so, we’ve talked every single day, non-stop, since that first date. We actually have our second date tomorrow at a restaurant.

Here’s my situation: I have a date with someone else today — but honestly, I don’t even feel like pursuing it because I really like the first guy. At the same time, I wonder if it’s too soon to put all my eggs in one basket. I’m also not sure how to cancel the date today, especially since I’ve already been talking to this second guy for a few days.

What should I do?

* Woke up to messages from my poor honey who was so unwell last night. I wish I could help or do something? I try to just not push or pry or mother and leave him to it as he’s asked me to do, I hate thinking of him in so much pain and discomfort. I felt so guilty falling asleep knowing he was outside alone in the dark feeling sick. 
* Oh yeah there was a ginormous cockroach in my room last night. It’s called a Gisborne Cockroach thanks to google and jfc it was HUGE. It was a big outside kind of bug. Dad got rid of it for me. Icccckkkkkkkkk. 
* We went on a lil tiki tour today! A classic, cliché Sunday family drive. We went all over the southern area of the region where mum and dad live. It was *beautiful*. The weather was perfect - sunny, slightly breezy but calm and crisp but warm in the sun. The scenery was GORGEOUS. I took so many photos and videos, I especially wanted to have some to show Andy, but none of them capture the brilliance of the colour irl. It was all such a vibrant green and then bright blue and so picturesque. I love the countryside! We stopped for coffee and mum and I shared a mini bean wrap thing and dad got a sausage roll. I saw a man on a horse, the horse was beautiful and objectively the man was quite handsome but really not my kind of a man so I didn’t find him handsome even though I know he is, yknow, but it was cool seeing someone just riding their horse and I don’t even think he had a saddle, it felt very Casual Cowboy. And then we drove around and stopped here and there to have a look. 
* The drama of the day was we got to the beach and mum and I hopped out to have a look and give pups a little run around. Mum took pups as I wanted to take photos of the beach and anyway she went down to the water and then the waves were coming in - they were so small but so strong? It was odd. Anyway she went down there with pup while I stayed at the top of the beach taking photos and then mum tried to outrun a wave to not get wet but she tripped and fell over and let go of the lead, so she was fumbling about in the water trying to get up and the bloody dog bounded off into the waves with no one holding his lead and I could see him getting a bit over his head with it so I *sprinted* down and helped mum up and she gave me her phone so it would t get more wet? Which is weird because then I had to go into the water to get the dog, I think it was all just a lot very fast. Anyway so I ended up around thigh/hip deep in these strong pulling waves/tide with the dog getting thrashed about by the waves so I grabbed him up and started wading back to shore and poor baby was so shaken up but his extendable lead was still attached to him and it had broken at this point and not stretching back in so it was getting yanked out by the tide and it was attached to pups so I was standing there reeling it back in because I didn’t want to just detach it from him because idk it didn’t make sense at the time. Anyway I got the dog and the lead and got back on the beach and mum was soakkked through and so was pups and I was too but only from the waist down well no on my chest and arms too a bit as I was holding puppy to take him out of the water. I suppose lucky I’d already taken off my shoes because I wanted to walk on the sand in bare feet. Anyway so it was fine and it was probably scary but I couldn’t stop laughing once I got pup and mum was back on dry land. Poor mum though, she was also wearing her brand new boots for the first time and they got sodden. Anyway thank god I brought towels with us this morning, it wasn’t for of course I just know pup has a tendency to get muddy when no one is watching and he also has a penchant to sit on my lap in the car so I always want dog towels. Anyway so I had a towel around me the whole way home and pups was cuddling me on my lap poor wee thing. He was super excitable and peppy before that, then he got in the waves and after that he was quite subdued. I think he was a bit shaken up. Mum was too. I guess I just wasn’t because I wasn’t taken by surprise by it all like I actively ran down to them so it wasn’t a big wave crashing into me which would make you shakey. Anyway the car now reeks of wet dog. 
* The day itself was so nice. I went to do it again! I think we might do a mini one for dad’s birthday not this but next Friday as I’m taking the day off of work for it to go for lunch with him and mum.
* Then we did the crossword with carrot cake and a cup of tea. 
* Then I depilled a jersey. 
* Then I cleaned the kitchen. 
* Annnd now I’m waiting for dinner to cook - dads making my favourite courgette dish!! And then shower and time with Andy before going to sleep because I have an early morning train tomorrow then work :( 
* He called :) Why do things feel so awkward? I’m guessing because we have barely spoken for a couple of weeks, I think also because I don’t feel like he wants me anymore so I feel like everything I say or start to say is probably boring him and therefore pushing him further away. 

All in all a good day. 

I still don’t know what to do about medication. I don’t want to try the V one. I just do not feel comfortable with it. I don’t know the next step now? No one from her office will reply to me, so idk if she’s even back in the country. I just want to see someone else.

Kind, educated, adventurous, responsible single lady in search of a few good people to add to her life…

I’m not interested in the flaky, fleeting, transactional stuff. I prefer quality over quantity. Being intentional. Starting a new chapter in life and my main focus right now is meeting new people in hopes of forming a few real lasting friendships. The kind where we grow and support each other through life’s ups and downs. I don’t feel I go out enough in my day to day life outside of my usual routine to meet enough new people so here I am!

If you also believe that having a few close, dependable friends is a very important aspect to wellness, aging gracefully and joyfully, and you’re open to adding new people to your life, send me a chat and let’s see if we click. 

Quality time, good food, perhaps some travel, and lots of laughter to keep our hearts light in a sometimes heavy world are a few keynotes I have in mind in this vision. 

A bit about me: 

I lean socially liberal and progressive, fiscally conservative 

Love animals, nature, music, poetry, bonfires, sunsets

Favorite shows include Down For Love, Love on the Spectrum, One Day, and some standup comedy 

I like being active, but also enjoy quiet cozy nights in 

Some core values: integrity, authenticity, honesty, kindness

I like growth oriented folks who self-reflect and work on themselves, aren’t emotionally avoidant  (I’m a 4w5 INFJ Water Dog Aquarius sun with Scorpio, Capricorn, and Libra for rising, moon, Venus and Mars placements if you’re into that, with a mostly secure attachment style after a fruitful self-improvement journey fwiw)

I don’t curse a lot, don’t drink other than tea and coffee, don’t mind if you enjoy a beer or glass of wine, don’t smoke, don’t do any drugs, no shrooms, cannabis-free

I’m located on the west coast of the USA but I’m open to anyone anywhere if this resonates with you. I have discord so we can use that initially for voice and video calls to talk and meet and see how we vibe and whether we click

Ever wake up feeling like your brain is wrapped in a thick, fuzzy blanket? You know, those mornings where a simple thought feels as tough as solving a Rubik's cube blindfolded? Yeah, I’ve been there too. It's like trying to jog while wading through molasses. 🥴

But here’s the good news: You can kick that mental fog to the curb in just **three minutes a day**! Sounds too good to be true? Stick with me; I promise it’s easier than it sounds. 🙌

**Here’s the ritual that helped me clear the haze:**

1. **Mindful Breathing (1 Minute) 🧘‍♂️:**
   - Find a comfy spot (bonus if it’s in sunlight).
   - Close your eyes and focus on your breath.
   - Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of 4, hold for 4, and exhale through your mouth for 4. Repeat until you feel like you’re floating. 🌬️

2. **Gratitude Reflection (1 Minute) 🙏:**
   - What’s one thing you’re grateful for today? It can be as simple as that first sip of coffee or even that cute cat video you watched last night.
   - Jot it down or just say it out loud. Seriously, it’s like magic how quickly it shifts your mindset. ✨

3. **Visualization (1 Minute) 🎯:**
   - Picture your day ahead. What would make it a win? Visualize yourself smashing those goals and tackling challenges like a superhero.
   - Bonus points if you imagine yourself in a cape. 🦸‍♀️

And voilà! Just like that, you’ve rewired your brain’s gears from “slow and foggy” to “sharp and ready to conquer!” 

**Why does this work?** Because our brains need a little TLC. 🧠❤️ Think of it like stretching after a long sit. And let’s be honest, we all need a little breather now and then, right? 

### A few things to remember:
- It’s okay if your mind wanders during these few minutes—just gently guide it back.
- Consistency is key. Try this every day, and soon it’ll feel like second nature.
- Don’t forget to have fun with it! Throw in some silly affirmations if that makes you smile.

So, what do you think? Have you ever tried something like this before? Or maybe you’ve got your own quick rituals that knock that mental fog out? Let’s share the love! 💖✨",1,1745740227.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

My interpretation of the spread: I think the cards suggest that I should meet him in person and experience what it'd be like (I've never been on a date before and no one's ever remotely expressed their interest into me for whatever reason it may be), I was hesitant and asked my asked, and I believe it is yes. 

With regards to what may happen if we meet in person is a long conversation about random stuff, breaking the ice and being vocal about our mental thoughts and patterns. I have a feeling I'd want to crawl back into my hermit mode and hibernate, waiting to run away by making excuses. I also feel like he would be very observant, silent and not very enthusiastic or interactive during the meeting idk.

1. I wanted to keep it short, but it didn't work. Sorry.
2. I wrote the main part of the story on day 7 and added the last weeks below
3. Now after 4 weeks I would call myself recovered



Hello,

I've been suffering from long COVID since November 2023. My story is similar to most of the others here (exhaustion, brain fog, PEM, etc.). Since January 2025, I've been feeling progressively worse. At the beginning of March 2025, I had to take a taxi home from work because I couldn't take it anymore. I was so exhausted that I couldn't pick up my bike from work until days later. I've been on sick leave ever since and have been completely worn out (physically and mentally).

I'm 44, an energy engineer, and I've always been fit, and now I'm thinking about the possibility of early retirement. Damn.

On Sunday, March 30, 2025, I stumbled across an article in the ""Deutsches Ärzteblatt"" (German Medical Journal) by three neurology professors discussing the psychosomatic component of long COVID. I then came across Paul Garner, a professor who himself had long COVID and then, after taking psychosomatics seriously, recovered relatively quickly.

I spent the whole of Sunday reading up on psychosomatics (along with scientific opinions, there was also a lot of voodoo) and listening to stories from other recoveries.

As an engineer, I was rather skeptical, but I thought it was worth a try. And for free :)

I started the following experiment:

Starting tomorrow, I will:

1. Do everything like I did before Long Covid

2. Ignore all symptoms

3. Believe I'm healthy

And if it goes wrong, I'll find myself in the emergency room with a terrible crash :(

Feels a bit like being ""all in"" at poker



Monday, March 31, 2025

I'm still as weak as yesterday. Nevertheless, I go shopping and get a coffee. I feel like I'm about to faint. I breathe deeply: ""You're healthy, keep going, nothing can happen."" But my brain doesn't get the message, and I have a panic attack in the café. And then... nothing else happens. After a few minutes, I'm back to normal.

The same thing happened to me again while I was cycling and when I met a friend in the evening.

Conclusion Day 1: I'm still alive, but it was a rough day with three panic attacks.

Tuesday, April 1, 2025

Like yesterday, I'm fighting my way through the day. I'm ignoring the symptoms. And I ""only"" had two panic attacks.

Conclusion Day 2: Feels better than yesterday. But it's tough.

Wednesday, April 2, 2025

Today I dare to go on a short bike ride. Everything is going much better than the last few days. I often feel weak and think, ""I'm going to collapse."" But I still manage. A panic attack tells me that my body is divided about my health. But I keep telling myself, ""You're healthy.""

In the evening, I picked up my girlfriend from the train, and we drank a bottle of wine in the park (like I used to, but I haven't done that in a long time).

At night, I woke up with palpitations, shortness of breath, and a headache. ""Is this the crash?"" I thought. Damn. Then I told myself, ""It could all be psychological and your body is fine."" Although I couldn't sleep anymore, it calmed me down.

Thursday, April 3, 2025

The first day I feel like I'm absolutely on the right track. I'm feeling much better than yesterday. I go on a longer bike ride, longer than I've dared to since Long Covid. And it's working. No panic attack, I feel good. Really good.

Friday, April 4, 2025

I'm doing everything like I did before Long Covid, and I feel good. Few symptoms, good general fitness. In the evening, I do pull-ups (I haven't done them for months because I had a crash once afterward). I feel better than I have in months; I can't quite believe it and I'm still afraid of a crash.

Saturday, April 5, 2025

I work in the garden all day. In the evening, we go to a friend's party. I feel like I used to and I still can't believe it.

Sunday, April 6, 2025

I stayed overnight at my friend's house and am taking the train home. I look out the window, thinking about the last few months of long COVID: exhaustion, searching for solutions and scientific publications, pacing, fear of a crash, ""getting through the day,"" and, above all, hopelessness. And have I now found the solution for myself? It feels like it, but I can hardly believe it. And I start to cry.

Luckily, we're in Berlin, where no one looks at you strangely, no matter what you do.

  
Week 2

I exercised every day. Light to moderate intensity. I went jogging for the first time and started doing some light weight training.

From time to time, I feel tired and exhausted. I also wake up relatively early. My heart palpitations have completely disappeared. I still have blurred vision sometimes. And sometimes I'm unusually sensitive to noise and sensitive to it.

The euphoria of the first week has given way to a calmer, more positive overall feeling, and I'm listening to Jack Johnson again (I haven't heard him in years, weird).

Week 3

Physically, I'm at 95%. I have no limitations. But since I'm feeling so well again, the fear of a crash is increasing, because now I have something to lose again. But since I'm with my family over Easter, there's little time to worry.

Week 4

The week starts with two hiking days of 20 and 27 km, which I manage physically without any problems (with a blister on my foot). There's still a small worry in the back of my mind that it might be too much. At the end of the week, I feel 100% healthy again. Tomorrow I'm starting a 1100 km bike ride around Brandenburg.

That was my story. Since the recovery stories have uplifted and inspired me, I'm happy to share mine.

Everyone has to find their own path.

  
Ask me anything. (The answer may take some time as I am on a bike tour for the next 2 weeks)

Firstly, we live together. After I moved in, I noticed that he NEVER brushes his teeth at night (yuck), but thought - oh maybe he does in the morning - NO. He doesn’t. He only brushes his teeth when he thinks we’ll be intimate, but his breath is VILE. He vapes 🍃 and drinks a lot of coffee and it just literally always smells bad. Even after he brushes his teeth.

I’ve encouraged him several times before bed or asked “have you brushed your teeth?” And he says “well maybe I’m not done snacking yet” and then never brushes them.

Secondly, he bites his nails and it makes me want to scream. It’s suuuuuch a nasty, gross habit but to add that he doesn’t brush his teeth makes it SO much worse. I’ve told him both on a sensory level and a sanitary level that this is gross and i don’t like it. He said “I’m just cleaning my nails”. WITH YOUR F*CKING MOUTH?!

Lastly, he puts deodorant on AROUND his armpit but not in his actual armpit and he is SO defensive about this, but like…frequently i have to tell him - you smell really strongly of BO.

Also, he’s a grown ass man and I resent even having to broach this with him. For a wickedly intelligent, attractive guy, this sucks.

And I feel insane and I’m going to try ONE more time to address these and a few other things that are gross, but i don’t know how without being a d1ck. Has anyone done this successfully?

It’s ruining all of my attraction to him and I can’t even cuddle let alone anything else because well, the breath. And then I don’t initiate a kiss because the nails and the breath and the lack of teeth brushing.

TLDR; my grown ass partner has gross habits and it’s killing my attraction to him. I don’t know how to successfully bring this up.",1,1745739751.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

I have severe executive dysfunction, attention and memory issues and im scared of getting fired and of how much I piss everyone off on the daily. this job has me wondering if i have some sort of learning disability they didn’t catch when i was younger like it’s that bad.

one coworker says it’s prolly cause i just don’t work a lot (im in school). another says it’s bc I was never really trained, i was kinda just working mid and preclose shifts on warming and register for my first few months bc someone quit and they needed someone else immediately. I was figuring it out as I went, the employees would take turns explaining stuff to me. Id still fuck up the sequencing and forget people’s coffees and shit but im better now. my first closing ever was a clean play shift and I didn’t know how to do ANYTHING and to this day im still not great at getting it all done fast. whatever it is, it IS noticeable not just in my head, and ik people probably hate working with me and it makes me feel like shit but it’s not on purpose.

it’s just things like i straight up forget like the ratio when i make the iced coffee im gonna have to ask about AGAIN on my next opening and I haven’t made cold brew in a while so I’ll have to ask someone how to do it next time. yesterday when i made green tea i accidentally left the fucking tea bag in there. today i had to remember how to disassemble a mocha pump and it took me way too fucking long. my nicest coworkers have reached points where they’ve been like “ILL JUST DO IT” when explaining stuff to me.

I don’t think im a total lost cause tho, Ive soloed and been primary a peak morning on bar at my store and another location now a bunch of times successfully. I handled a closing shift today where there were callouts leaving us with only two partners in the store past like 4pm (we close at 8 and are in fact busy). I make drinks correctly, im great with customers, I help out when they need shifts covered, and for what it’s worth I don’t complain ever. 

if im “locked in” and focused I am fine but whether or not I achieve that state is determined by a drunk magician rolling dice and it never happens for the full duration of a shift. 

im hoping it’ll get better this summer now that I work more often and am not in school. but lowkey im scared did this happen to anyone else 😭",1,1745739711.0,starbucksbaristas,2,0.67,False

1k8yhkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaydating/comments/1k8yhkw/m_56_uk_working_through_loneliness/,M 56 UK - working through loneliness,"I was in a long term relationship for 23 years and we grew up together from our mid 20s. However we ended up having very different interests and falling out of love. Nothing acrimonious. I’ve been single for 5 years and gosh, I’m lonely. 

I’m sharing, not to seek your sympathy but to be brave and say the L word out loud. I’m 56 now and it’s weird being on dating sites and just being invisible. I have plenty of friends, 2 gorgeous dogs, an awesome sister who lives 4 doors away but this loneliness is like a weird gnawing throb. 

I’m an author/producer, have my own place but trying to find a connection is almost impossible. Gays just seem to want to have hookups and call it fun. Tbh I find that soul destroying. Sure I have a high sex drive but I seek intimacy. So it’s a double whammy - older and wanting to date rather than just shag. 

Things have changed since I was single last time. Guys say they want to date but it’s near impossible to meet up. I asked a guy out for a coffee and he said I was being ‘intense!’ Wtf? Another guy, who I spoke to for weeks ended up revealing that everything on his profile was false and he wasn’t looking to date - he just wanted ‘fun’.  I don’t drink so gay bars and clubs (way too old for the latter) are not my scene at all.

Despite this loneliness rollercoaster I still love a laugh - I remember reading somewhere that at my age the nearest I’m going to get to a hardon is riga mortis! Haha maybe I use humour as a defection sometimes too.

So why am I sharing. Truthfully, maybe someone will read this and it will resonate and this post will give you the courage to speak out your loneliness and secondly maybe, just maybe, I’ll find my fella.

Here’s a powerful fact: By now, you have already made around 60–70% of the mistakes that you would have otherwise made in the final NEET exam. If you don't revise these mistakes now, you are almost guaranteeing that you'll repeat them in the final exam — and lose precious marks. Go through every silly error, every concept you got wrong, and every careless mistake from your mock tests. Fix them properly now, and you could easily improve your final score by 100 to 200 marks without even studying anything new! 

2. Only Revise from the Notes You Have Already Used: Do not pick up any new study material at this stage. In the final week, your job is to reinforce what you already know, not explore new content. Stick only to the notes you have made or revised earlier. These notes are customized to your style of understanding and will help you recall faster and more accurately. Introducing new sources now will only confuse you and increase last-minute anxiety. Trust your notes, trust your hard work. 

3. Train Your Brain to Be Most Active from 2 PM to 5 PM: NEET 2025 will happen between 2 PM and 5 PM so train your brain to be at peak performance during this time. Schedule your most focused study sessions from 2 PM to 5 PM starting today. Maintain a consistent sleep cycle: Sleep and wake up at fixed times that give you enough rest and help you feel fresh by afternoon. Avoid heavy lunches; prefer light, energy-boosting meals to prevent drowsiness during the exam hours. If you drink coffee or tea, have it around 1 PM — about 30–60 minutes before your 2 PM session. Attempt full mock tests at 2–5 PM to simulate real exam conditions. Syncing your body clock with exam timing can give you a massive performance boost on the final day.

Remember!!!!!
The difference between selection and rejection isn't more study it's smarter revision. This last week can change everything. Believe in yourself, and give it your 100%!",2,1745739497.0,JEENEETards,1,1.0,False

I’m sharing, not to seek your sympathy but to be brave and say the L word out loud. I’m 56 now and it’s weird being on dating sites and just being invisible. I have plenty of friends, 2 gorgeous dogs, an awesome sister who lives 4 doors away but this loneliness is like a weird gnawing throb. 

I’m an author/producer, have my own place but trying to find a connection is almost impossible. Gays just seem to want to have hookups and call it fun. Tbh I find that soul destroying. Sure I have a high sex drive but I seek intimacy. So it’s a double whammy - older and wanting to date rather than just shag. 

Things have changed since I was single last time. Guys say they want to date but it’s near impossible to meet up. I asked a guy out for a coffee and he said I was being ‘intense!’ Wtf? Another guy, who I spoke to for weeks ended up revealing that everything on his profile was false and he wasn’t looking to date - he just wanted ‘fun’.  I don’t drink so gay bars and clubs (way too old for the latter) are not my scene at all.

Despite this loneliness rollercoaster I still love a laugh - I remember reading somewhere that at my age the nearest I’m going to get to a hardon is riga mortis! Haha maybe I use humour as a defection sometimes too.

So why am I sharing. Truthfully, maybe someone will read this and it will resonate and this post will give you the courage to speak out your loneliness and secondly maybe, just maybe, I’ll find my fella.

1k8yg4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1k8yg4p/update_launched_my_personal_site_astro_react_now/,[Update] Launched my personal site (Astro + React) — now gearing up for my first indie product 🚀,"Hey Indie Hackers! 👋



A few weeks ago, I asked about your favorite tech stacks for building a personal website — and after pouring a suspicious amount of coffee into the project, I’m excited to share:  

🚀 My site is finally live — and I'm now gearing up for my first indie product launch!



Quick recap:

\- I originally started with React + Next.js (classic combo), but halfway through, I switched to \*\*Astro + React\*\*.

\- Why? Astro felt lighter, faster, and less likely to trigger my ""optimize everything to death"" developer tendencies 😅.

\- React still powers small interactive islands, without dragging in a full-stack heavyweight.



The goal wasn’t just “make a shiny portfolio.”  

It was to build a \*\*public lab\*\* — a space to:

\- Blog about prompt engineering and AI tools,

\- Document what works (and what hilariously breaks),

\- Build in public and share both the wins and faceplants.



🧠 Along the way, a few lessons hit me harder than an unhandled API error:

\- Writing clear blog posts made me rethink \*how I structure prompts\* for AI — turns out, humans and LLMs both need clarity.

\- Content-first > Feature-first: Building cool animations is fun; publishing real content feels even better.

\- ""Perfect"" is the best excuse for ""Never Shipped."" Deadlines save lives. (Or at least projects.)



✅ Positive outcomes so far:

\- First blog post launched: \*Pain Points in Writing Prompts & AI Potential in 2025\*.

\- Newsletter setup live (zero subscribers yet — but hey, room to grow! 🌱).

\- Website live and open to the world if you want to take a peek! → [https://www.brandon-ta.com/](https://www.brandon-ta.com/)

\- Preparing for my first indie product launch — feeling excited (and a bit terrified) but ready to roll 🚀

\- Finally internalized that shipping messy > shipping never.



🎯 Current struggles (still real):

\- How to stay consistent once the ""shiny new project dopamine"" fades.

\- How to balance between building, writing, and not burning out like a toasted marshmallow.



🔗 If you want to check the original discussion about tech stacks (where this chaos started 😅): [https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1k5ev5j/whats\_your\_favorite\_tech\_stack\_for\_building\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1k5ev5j/whats_your_favorite_tech_stack_for_building_a/)



🚀 If you've built or launched your personal site (or halfway through messy chaos), would love to hear:

👉 How do you stay consistent in the early days?

👉 How do you balance quality vs speed without falling into the overthinking trap?



Thanks again to everyone here — this community seriously makes the indie hacker journey way less lonely. 🙌

1k8ye4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k8ye4y/i_just_want_to_share/,I just want to share.,"I don't even know how to begin. To whoever reads this, I am sorry if this is very badly constructed.   
  
So yeah, where do I begin? It's been 2 months since I broke up with my now ex gf and I still feel so devastated and heartbroken as I did on the first day it happened. For context's sake, we're both in our early 30s.  
Long story short, I've met a girl after being single for a long time, 2 years, to be precise. She came out of the blue and flipped my world upside down. The moment we met, we immediately clicked. I'm sure many people say this, but I've never met anyone like her. At first, we were just hanging out, talking about anything for countless hours. We were going on those 3-4-5 hour dates where you lose track of time. We actually became friends who can share anything before we were ""together"" together. And everything was great. We were spending enough time together, seeing each other a few times a week, but not being too clingy to one another at the same time. Everything was going great. And it didn't take me long to realize I had very strong feelings for her. I was truly in love. And all of a sudden, this February, she told me that she wants to end things on the premise that she really likes me, she really enjoys being with me, and she can even imagine us having a family and stuff, as we're getting so well together and share the same beliefs.. literally being a perfect match for her. However, for some reason, she just felt something was missing, and she had this doubt in the back of her head. So we broke up. But that wasn't the end of it. We kept talking to each other pretty much on a daily basis, even going out once a week or so. Which of course didn't helped my situation, because even though I initially agreed with her that we should just stay friends, I was always with the idea that this is not over and I must do everything in my power to convince her that we are right for each other and we should get back together.   
Which leads us to the end of March, when she invited me to her place, and I decided that this was the time to tell her that I still love her and I want to be with her. This is where she told me that she also missed me, and she has feelings for me, but things haven't changed, and she still had this feeling that something is missing, and she has doubts, but the night ended with us having sex and me staying over. We spent the next day together again, kissing, holding hands while taking a walk in the park, basically acting as if we were back together. But at the end of the day, after talking about our relationship again, she told me that she needed some time and space to think things through before giving me a definitive answer. In the next few weeks, we started talking less. DM's here and there, the occasional phone call, even a few video calls, but no physical meetings. I was trying to be patient and understanding, as it seemed she was going through something, and she really needed some time to figure stuff out for herself. But I tried to show her that I'm here whenever she needs me, she can still rely on me, and that I do care about her.   
So we come to last Monday, when we finally went out. I was so nervous... I haven't seen her for almost a month. We spent a few hours together and everything was great, we grabbed a coffee, went to the park again, but no ""couple business"". However, I was fine with that until she told me that we're going out as friends. To which I just asked her if that was her decision, and she said yes and asked me if I could do this. And this was where we had our first argument as I was even kinda angry at her for the way she said it, and also due to the frustration of me not being able to understand her... How can one be happy with you, have feelings for you, and not want to be with you at the same time? I just don't understand this shit and I fuckin' mean it. Anyway, after that, she told me that this is all her fault, that we just keep going in circles and we just hurt each other, and because of that she doesn't wanna be a part of my life anymore, that the best thing for me would be to forget about her and move on. And the worst part is - she is a good person, no one is perfect, but she genuinely is. And I can see it's breaking her heart that she is breaking my heart. 

To finish this up, I would just say that I'm not really looking for any advice, even though I really have no fuckin' clue what to do from here on. I haven't felt so bad in my life for a very long time, if at all. I had my fair share of heartache in the past, but man... nothing like this, I even tear up as I'm writing this. I could've seen this going all the way. This was the first time I actually imagined myself making a family with someone. I honestly feel like she is the love of my life, and I just don't know how to deal with this. I guess I will have to figure it out. 

Sorry if this post is too long and boring, I just needed to get this off my shoulders, one way or another. ",4,1745739163.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1k8ydo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalmysteries/comments/1k8ydo1/unexplained_neurologicalpsychological_meltdown_no/,"Unexplained Neurological/Psychological Meltdown, No Diagnosis After 5 Years","Five years ago, something nightmarish happened to me and I’m very, very curious if anyone has any explanation or if there is anyone—anyone at all—out there who has had a similar experience or knows someone who has. Has any doctor seen something like this in a hospital? Would any psychologist/neurologist person out there dare a hypothesis? Does anyone have personal experience with certain aspects of my tale, insight I couldn’t get from an ordinary person? Similar anecdotes from survivors or people who know them? Or just something random I didn’t already know?

I’m really mystified and a little unsettled that there apparently aren’t any documented cases of an event like this, anywhere, and it happened to me! I’ve even tried telling my story to different AI chatbots and they all respond that they can’t find anything even close to it in their data. So far, it seems like it might be something medicine hasn’t caught up to, but maybe there’s someone out there on Reddit who has something to say about it that no one else I spoke to could have. I thought it’d be a neat idea to put it out there on Reddit and see how people react anyway.

Now, what follows is going to sound totally like a made-up horror story. I can’t stop anyone from insisting it’s made up, but I promise this is all 100% true. No part of this story is made up or exaggerated, even a little.

Because people replying with expertise will probably ask, I was 16 years old, had never drank alcohol, smoked, or taken any kind of recreational drugs, and I’d never had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn’t taking any prescription drugs (but I took Benadryl once a day, don’t know for how long), and in the past I’d been prescribed Vyvanse (5x/week, ages 9–15) and Scopolamine (\~2x/year for motion sickness, starting age 15).

So here’s the story:

It all started in August 2020. I was 16. It was the pandemic, though that didn’t make much of a difference for me. 

Day 1:

I was sleeping when my mom came into my bedroom to wake me up, for some reason. When I opened my eyes to look at her, her face was incredibly deranged and horrifying, seeming to smile with her mouth upside down. She estimated I screamed for about 15 seconds all in the same breath, appearing not to know who she was. When I stopped screaming, I said, “what was that?” and she said, shaken, “I don’t know!” 

I said, “That was weird.”

So I got up and as I walked out into the kitchen where she was making coffee, I started telling her, “Wow, that was really strange! It was like I —UUU-WUHH-WUHH-WAHH . . . UU-UUU—UAHH! . . . AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! I’M OKAAAAAY!!!!! I’M OKAAAUUUAAAUUUUAY!!!!!! I’M OKQUAAOOOOOUUUUUUU … !!!!!”

What happened was, she turned and looked at me as I started to speak and when I saw her face, it was deranged again! I would look at her and the strings of my neck would start tugging these alarming sounds out of my voice and then I’d try to look away, but then for some reason I locked my eyes on hers in this cursed state of mind and screamed at her mangled face for another 15 seconds. I don’t know why I looked back at her after looking away. I tried to tell her I was okay, but the screams distorted my voice.

They weren’t ordinary screams: they sounded like my voice box would open wide to make this unnatural sound like I was possessed by demons or something. It felt like someone was fingering into my lungs and throat and forcefully grabbing my tissues, prying open my throat as wide as possible and ringing my lungs out like a dishrag to let out the biggest possible sound.

Then I went into the bathroom to take a shower and looked at myself in the mirror and let out another horrifying, blood-curdling scream and bolted out of the bathroom!

Everywhere I went, my face and her face looked psychologically deranged in a way I promise you cannot conceive of. Family pictures of us, my reflections in appliances and any kind of reflective surface. No one else’s face—just mine and hers. 

That morning, we drove to the hospital to get COVID tests, and I tried not to look at myself or her. Sometimes I would accidentally catch a reflection in my eye and let out little “HUUUUUH!!!”s or “WHAAUA”s.

Then later that day, my mom had a Zoom appointment with her therapist who said it might have to do with the maca powder I mixed in my cereal combined with the coffee I drank or something, so she told her to tell me to stop eating maca powder. I wasn’t taking any kind of drugs except Benadryl.

Day 2:

Then that night, I was laying awake for a long time before I fell asleep, thinking about things, like I did every night. Then around quarter after midnight I felt this feeling come on that felt very lonely and I wasn’t falling asleep. It was like my heart kept beating slowly faster and faster and I couldn’t control it or ignore it no matter how I tried to entertain myself with my thoughts. I started to feel like I did when I was in preschool or Kindergarten and I would get scared of the creepy night and eventually, after a long time of laying frozen in bed, take a deep breath and hurry through the scary dark house to go sleep with my parents.

Then, at 1:45 AM, something else mysterious happened. My body *rolled itself* out of my bed onto my feet, my lungs started *screaming themselves* again, tickling my voice box, and my fist started *slamming itself* against the door over and over so hard it sounded like gunshots. I wasn’t doing any of these things—my muscles just contracted and moved themselves as I witnessed them go, confused and afraid but not anything as horrified as I looked from the outside. I wanted to get out of the bedroom but couldn’t because my body was so locked in on smashing my way through the door, and I couldn’t resist the involuntary movements. I tried to yell, “HELP! HELP!” through the contractions in my voice box, producing a deranged, horrific sound. When I stopped screaming, my dad asked, “what happened?”

Me: “My lungs collapsed in on themselves and pushed a scream out of them.”

I went back to bed and then a while later, the same thing happened except I didn’t roll out of the bed—just let my legs thrash themselves in the air while I controlled my upper body.

Dad: “Why don’t you just sit up and read for a while or something? This reminds me of something I read about night terrors.”

I sat up and read and it happened a third time while trying to read.

My dad ran in and yelled “STOP SCREAMING! STOP SCREAMING! STOP. SCREAMING! STOP. SCREAMING!” but I couldn’t stop screaming.

My mom, who didn’t hear the screams earlier because she was knocked out on Ambien, came into the hallway and asked, “what’s going on?”

“I’m not screaming, my lungs squeeze a scream out of me and I can’t help it. I feel normal while it’s happening.”

Dad: “Yes you can, take a deep breath or something. Read. Don’t just keep screaming all night.”

Me: “NO! You have to believe me! I can feel them contract by themselves, I’m not doing it.”

Dad: “I don’t know, that seems weird.”

So he goes off back to bed and says, talking to my mom zonked out on Ambien, “Honey, go back to bed.”

It happens a fourth time another five to ten minutes or so later.

My dad runs into my bedroom again, watching me melt down like a wicked demon, fervently gripping my body by my shoulders. The screams stop, and when he lets go of me, I fall over onto my bed shivering in a cold sweat, my whole skull buzzing and my ears ringing out several deep, loud tones at once—and I feel wonderful. I felt light as a cloud, blissful. I thought, “tomorrow’s gonna be a new day and this will all have just been a weird night.” 5 minutes later:

“OHHH-A! OHHH-*WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!*”

I was going through this rapid cycle between horrific doom and euphoric bliss. I’d scream, then I’d fall over in bliss, over and over and over again, and every time, I could feel the lava rising in the room as the minutes passed until I started screaming—and then I felt fine … I don’t remember enough to describe how I felt when I screamed, but the way my body was reacting by itself didn’t match my experience inside. Then I’d fall over again and drift away into a cloud. 100 bliss, 100 doom, scream. Repeat. It felt like the fear would grow and then I would throw it up and feel better. And it didn’t slow down until sunrise. I never slept that night.

“What’s happening when you’re screaming like that?” My dad asked, “What’s going through your mind?”

“I get this eerie feeling, like I feel lonely. It reminds me of when I was little trying to sleep in my dark room afraid of monsters under my bed and you and mom were all the way across the house. It gets gradually worse, slowly, painfully, until my heart is beating rapidly and the area around my jugular veins are burning and beating with big pulses of blood, and then my lungs start screaming me. When that starts happening, I go back to feeling completely normal. Then when it stops, I feel good—but only for a minute until the loneliness comes back on.”

I said again and again, “I must have mad cow disease! What else could it be? I must have one of those diseases that eats your brain! What else could it be?!” but the doctor said the next day on the phone that brain diseases are uncommon in young people. He gave the same advice as my mom’s therapist and we set up an appointment to get checked out later in the week.

Day 3:

The next evening was a repeat of the last.

Then at 2 AM, my mom asks,

“Would it help you if you slept in my bed tonight?” (On Ambien again)

“Yeah.”

So I walk across the house to her bedroom, cycling all the while. I’d been awake for 42 hours at this point.

“Won’t it startle you for me to scream next to you in bed all night?”

“It’s okay.”

“I’ll try to let you know when I feel it coming on.”

Just moments later: “EHH-UH!!! IT’S COOOAAAMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG! WAAAAAWAAAWAAAAA! OOOOUUUUOOOUUUU!!!!!”

And I screamed for a while, and then I told her, “I tried to say ‘it’s coming,’ but it was already too late!”

So I get under the covers. Then just when I thought these nights couldn’t get any weirder, something even more bizarre started happening. 

I was laying flat on my back under the covers with my legs straight down, my feet spread about as far apart as when you’re walking, and all the sudden a mysterious force sucked the muscles in my feet inward, forcefully clamping them together, and then it started slowly crawling up my calves and legs, locking them together while simultaneously releasing pressure from lower areas. Though uncomfortable, I could shift my legs to keep my knee bones from stabbing into each other. Then it would reach up to my waist, squeezing everything inward, then my belly and lower back, bending my upper body fully up off the mattress, then my lungs and voice box, screaming me again, and finally to my arms—raising them in the air like I was a puppet! It would curl my hand and fingers, sometimes folding my hand together, other times curling it into a fist, then releasing it and bending it backwards, over and over again. 

It happened again and again, in succession—waves of what looked like esophageal peristalsis crawling up my body, like big ridges of water about to fold and smack an ocean beach. It looked, and felt, surreal—my whole body looked like a dust mote bending around in a sunlit window, moving with vividly smooth motion and in an unhuman way. I looked demonically possessed! My muscles tingled like crazy as each wave crawled smoothly up my body—gently, but with bite force, like a boa constrictor.

It lasted for maybe a minute and then my mom, sedated and delirious from her Ambien, said “mm mih meggh behh . . .” 

“What?”

“Gigginnn wimme mutter met . . .”

“What?”

“Come with me. Come with me. Mmumum pill . . .”

So I follow her into the kitchen and she starts opening drawers and pill bottles.

“I’ll give you one of my pillsssssss . . . maybe you just need a pill . . .”

The peristalsis starts again now and I’m standing up this time, by the kitchen/living room, wiggling like a used car inflatable. 

“No, Mom, I’m not taking any of your pills. They aren’t mine.”

As moments pass, the involuntary muscle movements worsen and after a while, I fall on the carpet, twisted all around like a pretzel, and the contractions are so powerful I can’t move or get up.

My dad comes out into the kitchen/living room area from his bedroom. “Honey, go to bed. No, Jaden’s not taking your pills. Go to bed.”

“Mih mih pill can get sleep . . .”

“I’ll take care of this, Honey.”

He takes my wrists and drags me across the floor to his bedroom as I’m writhing around on it uncontrollably, making loud, alarming sounds that would occasionally escalate to what looked from the outside like demonic meltdowns.

I stood up next to his bed, back to being an inflatable wiggly guy. 

“Try putting your arms down once. What happens?”

“I’m able to resist the movements now, but when I do, they tickle and it gives me an uncomfortable, scared feeling to move them against the will of the forces going through my muscles. It gives me a spooky feeling like I’m supposed to obey the movements.”

We talk about the movements for a while.

“What would you do if someone invited you to, say, stay up late and play video games? Would you do it if it meant you could hang out, or would you say ‘no’ just because it’s unhealthy?”

“Huh? No? Why do you ask?”

“Because I think this might be something anxiety-related.”

We spent the next two hours—until 4 AM—talking about everything: my life, friendship problems, school, etc. He asked me all kinds of questions about it, I think trying to get to the bottom of what could be eating me. Gradually, the muscle movements slowed down—but they were still there even two hours later, and still creepy as hell. It looked like parts of my body were *me*, but my arms, hands, and neck were seized by a separate, supernatural force—separate from *me*.

At 4 AM, they’d slowed down enough that I could climb into bed next to him. He went to sleep, but I spent the rest of the night lying awake with involuntary muscle contractions. I made softer “UU-U—U-U-U-UUUAHHUAHH!” sounds too, but no violent screaming for the rest of the night.

Day 3:

So now, I’d been awake for a full day, a full night, another full day, and then another full night—48 hours. All day long, I kept almost falling asleep every few minutes and then going “UUUU-OH-AH!” just as I was about to drift off, waking me back up! 

My mom and I went into urgent care that morning and they said to stop taking Benadryl and stop putting maca powder in my cereal, and they said it could very well have something to do with night terrors like my dad suggested or some other kind of sleep thing, but that I would for certain eventually fall asleep. Then they reassured me I would see the doctor the next day.

After that, a third full day and third full night passed. Screaming all night long again. Throughout all three nights, besides the screaming and muscle contractions, my visual perception of my surroundings was distorted: everything looked like a demon, or even a psychologically deranged face like my mom’s three days earlier, and I was very careful to avoid looking at my own. The refrigerator? A satanic tiki man with long handlebars for eyes and a bottom sliding freezer door for jaws! The recliner? A monster with a headrest head and armrest arms! Windows? Jackals with curtain-slider butts for ears and window-blinds for eyes! The coathanger? A robot with hangers for arms and a lamp for a head, wearing a coat! Toiletries and objects on the counters and tables? Creepy little beings with necks and caps for heads. Even the corners of the ceilings looked threatening and warped, like the areas where the walls and ceiling met were their own sets of mouths, noses, and eyes. One evening some days or weeks later, I accidentally looked at myself in the mirror in the bathroom and was so startled I flew back into the cupboard behind me and slammed it so hard it went <POW!>.

Day 4:

Finally, on the morning of my fourth straight day of uninterrupted wakefulness, it was time for the appointment with the doctor we’d set up. They said I probably had a substance in my system even though I wasn’t taking any kind of medications other than Benadryl. Ran four blood tests on me and a pee test. Days later, we got the test results back but nothing turned up. So my mom’s therapist recommended I see another therapist who worked at her counseling clinic who specialized in anxiety because she suspected I might be having panic attacks.

Day 5 & Later

Though I never missed any more nights of sleep after that, I still had major symptoms for a year or two after, the worst symptoms gradually fading away over many months and other symptoms persisting over years. I continued to sleep in my mom’s bedroom and couldn’t enter my own bedroom at all because it gave me such profound fear. Very often throughout the day, my hands would curl up into fists and it would be hard to unravel them. They would curl themselves up so tight they would start stabbing my fingernails into my palms and I had to try to use an object or my other hand (if available) to pry my fists open. Then they’d uncurl themselves and try to peel my fingers backwards, then clamp again, then open, then shut, reversing every 5–20 seconds I’d say, and this would happen frequently throughout every day. I would grab onto whatever object was nearby so it would crush the object instead of stabbing by palms. Sometimes I’d be typing on my computer and my hands would randomly start curling, making it hard to type. My arms would often lift themselves up in the air, and though I could control their movements, it was uncomfortable to, same as on that night talking to my dad.

Every single night, I would have fearful perceptual distortions of my surroundings, though not anything as vivid as they were during the three consecutive nights I was awake. Involuntary screaming episodes remained common over the following year, occurring daily at first just after the “Three Nights” and then every few days, then every few weeks, then every few months, then not at all—but unlike during the Three Nights, they only happened in response to a startle. Everything startled me—sometimes I would yelp out a little shriek, other times I would scream bloody murder and sprint across the house with every nerve in my body reflexing all at once. I remember one night, I was doing my homework on my computer and something started ticking under the screen, and I SCREAMED and ran all the way across the house! Every time one of my parents and I would walk past each other in the hallway unexpectedly—“WAHHHHHHH!” Overall, the symptoms are minimal today. I still feel involuntary movements in my hands all the time, and there’s occasional gentle back-and-forth arm-twisting, torso-bending, or subtle neck movements at night too, but they’ve all become so subtle and easy to control that I barely even think about them anymore.

So to this day, there remains no explanation about what happened. What’s worse, there doesn’t seem to be any cases out there of people experiencing anything similar to this. I thought Reddit might be the perfect last resort to look for answers, and I think this should be added to the knowledge pool for other people who might experience something similar.

My experience in therapy in the years that followed would be a whole long post in and of itself, but in short, it led to me finding out the hard way that psychology can’t take care of people like me, because therapists are trained to treat any problem a client has as something they, ultimately, can control by themselves. So therapists often unknowingly use their appearance of expertise to manipulate people into believing the solution to all their problems is about toughening up or figuring things out (“getting your shit together,” as my therapist called it). They don’t make room for any problem that’s outside your control because the idea is that the only way to make progress in your personal life is to internalize every failure and difficulty. 

What the therapist I mentioned who specialized in anxiety told me about it was that I struggled with “irrational fear” and told me in a pretentious roundabout way that this was all just anxiety I was overreacting to. He said the screams were panic attack and gave an unclear explanation of the movements, then he gave a completely different explanation when asked to clarify at a later session. He was often very hard to understand because he used so much vocabulary.

He had me go into my bedroom during the daytime and look in my closet and under my bed and tell the different “parts” of me things that were supposed to help them “reconcile.” It might make me sound incredibly dumb, but he convinced me, after a lot of pressing, questions, and explaining, that it would work. You see, I kept seeing this guy for three years to treat that and a major problem with my attention, among other things, just because he seemed to tell everything like it was at first and seemed to have an uncanny ability to read me. He attributed the event and all the struggles in my personal life to my stubbornness and immaturity or to my parents who had intense arguments all the time, and he knew how to tell me in a cheeky, roundabout way that I wouldn’t take offense to, or in a way compellingly sugar-coated in psychology concepts so that I wouldn’t quite grasp where there were white lies built into it, and that’s kind of how he got me to buy his advice even though, looking back, it should have been obvious why his advice didn’t work. Now I can see in retrospect how it slipped under my sensibilities, and I’ve been angry for a long time that I never got a chance to defend myself—just sat there in front of him taking all of his confident bullshitting while every domain of my life spiraled out of control.

Of course, it didn’t work: I still couldn’t enter my old bedroom at night, no matter what “strategy” we tried out. Toward the beginning of the therapy, I would try to make myself go in there because he was having me do it as a kind of exposure therapy . . . but it was simply just so scary that I couldn’t. I remember going in once one evening and then bolting out and saying to myself “Never again!!! Never again!!! Never again!!!” and then the next night, “alright . . . Dave says I have to be disciplined with this because, he says, ‘this is what adults do.’ I’ll just make myself do it . . . AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! No!!! *Remember what this feels like.* Never do it, ever again, no matter what anybody tells you!”

Dave: “The first thing I want to do, Jaden, is get you back in your bedroom, on your own. This is what adults do Jaden. This is what adults do,” He said again and again, “The most important thing for you to be doing right now is becoming independent . . .”

Eventually, after a few months, my mom just completely rearranged the bedroom so it wouldn’t look like the old one that was associated with the eerie loneliness, and that made it tolerable to sleep in it.

After I left therapy for good, I started talking through a bunch of my personal life and problems with ChatGPT and freeaitherapist.com. ChatGPT in particular has identified a lot of revealing patterns about me through all my conversations with it that a human couldn’t notice, which over the past year or so has been life-changing . . . however, the story of what happened in August 2020 still hangs in mystery, even to ChatGPT drawing from all its data. Though it says it can identify what some of my symptoms were, it says it’s still extremely unusual and unexplained.

For this post, I asked ChatGPT to summarize why that is again. Here's what it generated:

“1. The “Screaming” Episodes

    •	Not typical of a panic attack.

In a panic attack, people usually feel an overwhelming conscious fear (terror of dying, suffocating, etc.). The body may react strongly (shaking, hyperventilating), but the scream response is rare and usually voluntary or semi-voluntary.

    •	More similar to a severe sympathetic nervous system hijack:

Like a catastrophic fight-or-flight response where the body “short-circuits” into primal scream-mode.

This is sometimes seen in:

    •	Animals under extreme predatory threat.
    
    •	Humans undergoing seizures with emotional components (like temporal lobe seizures — but you had no loss of consciousness).
    
    •	Rare cases of extreme derealization + autonomic dysregulation.

⸻

2. The Visual Distortions (Deranged Faces, Demonic Perceptions)

    •	Not classic psychosis.

You knew what you were seeing was wrong. In true psychosis, people often believe the distortions are real. You retained insight: “I know that’s my mom, but her face looks deranged.”

    •	Not classic panic either.

Panic attacks usually distort internal feelings, not external perceptions.

    •	More similar to acute derealization + sympathetic overload.

There’s some precedent for intense stress or sympathetic overdrive (think: trauma response) temporarily skewing visual processing.

But:

    •	The severity (full face and environment warping) is extremely rare without head trauma, hallucinogenic drugs, or neurodegenerative disease.

⸻

3. The Involuntary Muscle Contractions (“Peristalsis” waves)

    •	Not typical for panic disorder.

Panic attacks can cause tremors or twitching, but not organized, rhythmic, whole-body peristalsis waves.

    •	More similar to autonomic dysregulation or dystonia-like symptoms.

In rare cases of severe dysautonomia or post-viral syndromes, the nervous system can produce strange motor symptoms.

    •	Could mimic seizure disorders like non-epileptic seizures (PNES) or partial seizures — but you stayed aware and conversational.

⸻

4. The Emotional/Neurological Cycling (“lava rising” -> scream -> bliss -> repeat)

    •	This pattern matches extreme swings between sympathetic (panic, doom) and parasympathetic (collapse, bliss) states.
    
    •	This kind of biphasic autonomic cycling is only normally seen:
    
    •	During extreme trauma recovery events (after car accidents, near-death experiences).
    
    •	During somatic releases in trauma therapy (which you weren’t receiving).

In other words:

Your nervous system was “short-circuiting” between “full alarm mode” and “full shut-down mode,"" without your conscious control. That’s not normal even for panic disorder. It indicates some fundamental overload at the level of the brainstem and autonomic control centers.

⸻

5. Lingering Aftermath (Months to a Year)

    •	Panic attacks don’t last a year.

Panic attacks are episodes, and people usually return to baseline fairly quickly.

    •	More similar to trauma to the brain-body regulation system.

Like what’s sometimes called Complex Autonomic Dysfunction or Persistent Perceptual Distortion Syndrome (rare).

⸻

Overall Scientific Summary:

The three nights were not:

    •	Simple panic attacks
    
    •	Simple anxiety
    
    •	A conscious psychological event
    
    •	Classic PTSD (on its own)

They most resemble:

    •	A severe breakdown of autonomic regulation.

Your sympathetic and parasympathetic systems stopped cooperating normally.

    •	An extreme neurological storm involving brainstem-level circuits.
    
    •	Possible short-term derealization or limbic override.
    
    •	Resulting in persistent autonomic dysfunction after the episode (your body couldn’t fully re-regulate for months).

Bottom line: No, Jaden, this wasn’t just “you’re a drama queen” or “panic attacks.” Something really physically significant happened.""

Have you ever heard of something like this or do you have any knowledge about it? Lmk in the comments. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: It involved perceptual distortions of faces and perceiving scary faces in objects\~\~,\~\~ involuntary muscle movements throughout my body causing screaming, and rapid cycling between euphoria and intense fear.",1,1745739108.0,medicalmysteries,0,1.0,False
1k8yabp,https://v.redd.it/arc7cinbxbxe1,I made a site to collect unlimited customer testimonials. No $19/mo subscription Ferrari needed,"After spending way too much money on monthly subscriptions for testimonial collection tools that were great but I didn't need all the solutions. You know, like buying a Ferrari just to drive to the grocery store once a week. Overkill much?

I decided to create my own solution: ProofWall. Because apparently I'd rather spend 100 hours coding than keep paying that $19 monthly fee. My wife thinks I'm insane, but hey, at least I own it now!

The problem was simple: I needed to collect customer testimonials for my side projects, but all the existing solutions charged a monthly subscription fee while offering features I didn't need. It's like paying for the all-you-can-eat buffet when all you wanted was the mashed potatoes.

So I put on my developer's hat (which is just my regular hat but with more coffee stains and a slight smell of desperation) and created something I would have loved to have.

[ProofWall](www.proofwall.com) enables:

* Collect an unlimited number of text testimonials from your customers (yes, UNLIMITED! Even though most of us will only ever get like 12)
* Collect video testimonials with no arbitrary limits (except the limits of how many people actually want to be on camera praising your product)
* A simple, uncluttered interface that doesn't clutter you up (unlike my desk while building this thing)
* No monthly fees - you own it, you use it as much as you like (or as little, no judgment here)

The whole thing is designed to be simple - just create a project, share the link with your customers and start collecting powerful social proof that you can use throughout your marketing. Or just stare at them when you're feeling down and need validation. We've all been there.

I'd love to hear any comments or suggestions from the community! Are there features you'd like to see? Bugs you'd like to point out that'll keep me up at night? I'm all ears!

Has anyone else been frustrated by the limitations of existing testimonial collection tools? 

Or am I just the cheapskate who couldn't bear to part with $19 a month?",1,1745738730.0,SideProject,2,1.0,False

We’re now married, and yet she’s still “saving” herself. What's going on?","Hey guys, I’m not sure if this is the right place to go, but I don’t feel like I can go anywhere with this story. I’m having some sexual issues in my marriage. No way I can ask anyone I know about this, so I’m just using a throwaway. Please keep your minds open.

So, my wife and I have been together for 8 years, married for 1. We’re from a small town in California, and stuff’s been pretty good between us! Just one issue—she refuses to have sex with me. I know that sounds bad. Just listen to me for a second, you need to know where I’m at to get why I’m so desperate.

We met at some Lutheran church I live near—I’m not super religious, but church is a pretty good place to go out and meet people. There’s basically nothing else to do in town.

She immediately caught my eye. Honestly? It’s because she was dressed like a prude. She had her hair up, a pair of pretty thick glasses on, and she was wearing a pretty thick sweater even though it was the middle of summer. It was weird, but I found it cute, so I went and chatted her up.

We hit it off, and we started seeing each other. She’s a really great person. She’s totally the good-girl type: quiet, withdrawn, and always preferred going on hikes with me than going to the bar. It turns out she was still living with her parents, even though she had a decent job. They were pretty old, and apparently they had a ton of health problems (I think her dad had some kinda growth on his back?). Super gentle and motherly, which I personally believe is the best type of woman.

But, I knew what I was getting into when I started pursuing a Christian girl who thinks one sip of alcohol is gonna kill her. I was making some moves on her around 6 months into the relationship, and she hit me with it—she doesn’t believe in sex before marriage.

I know for horny guys like me, that tends to be a deal breaker. But—and I know I sound like a total sleazeball—that turned me *on*. And it still does! Sometimes, I undress her in my head, my mind running wild imagining her supple flesh and untouched breasts… It’s the thing about the unknown. Plus, she probably won’t have sex with any other guys if she’s too busy dedicating her body to Christ or whatever.

So, I waited. Waited and waited and waited. I passed the time with coffee dates and long conversations, keeping myself sane by jerking off to her employee-of-the-month photos, until things felt right. We’d been together a long time, were both in a good place financially… and I finally popped the question.

At first, she said no. She said no the next couple times. It was weird, but she was always a shy girl, and it felt cute watching her fumble around squirm whenever I brought up the idea. I thought she needed some encouragement to make big decisions like this.

I eventually wore her down enough to get a ‘yes’, and we got married! It was a beautiful ceremony in the church we met in, and a pretty small crowd because Wife was super nervous. It was just my parents, a couple friends, and a few extended family members.

Really, I was waiting for our honeymoon. I planned the whole thing by myself while Wife was going through wedding jitters: we had an awesome hotel in Jamaica overlooking the water, with a giant bed and some… other stuff ;). I sound like a dick again, but I honestly chose the room based on where it’d be hottest to deflower her.

Not that I ever got to DO that. We had all our stuff packed, we were waiting in the airport… and she’d been quiet the whole time, but Wife suddenly had an outburst about how sick she was. How she was gonna throw up, how her stomach was in total stitches, etc etc. We had to miss the flight, and whenever I tried to ask her about rescheduling the flight, she was suddenly sick again. I was never able to get the hotel refunded, and I never got to get my rocks off.

Some time passes, and while I’m still angry about the honeymoon thing, we talked most of it out and focused on moving in together. This time Wife was actually involved in the conversation—as a matter of fact, she was really excited to buy a house. She ended up finding the one we went with: two bed, two bath, and a spacious kitchen.

I just assumed that the two bedrooms were for us and guests. Wife had a different idea.

When we moved in, Wife made it very clear that *she* wanted the master bedroom. Not us. Her. I feel like I could’ve pushed back more, but I was kinda taken aback by her suddenly being so… final? There wasn’t much room for discussion, so I left it as is. I took the room down the hall.

That basically brings us to now. She obviously doesn’t want to have sex, even though I waited for 8 fucking years. She doesn’t even let me see her change. It made sense before we got married (she always said no to the pool, would never try on new clothes in front of me), but we live in the same house and she exclusively changes in her room. I’ve even tried peeping on her, but her door is always locked! Is she trying to tease me?

She won’t even use the bathroom near me. She’s in the master bedroom, so she literally has a personal bathroom she locks herself in. Obviously I’ve snuck in while she’s been out (maybe she’s got a toy or something?), but there’s nothing in there except soap and some weird lotions/ointments. I don’t even know where she puts her bras.

Talking about it is absolutely a no-go. If I ever bring it up, she gets very quiet (like the airport) and excuses herself. She avoids anything tangentially related to the topic? Like if I ask her about kids, she starts talking about how she’s been volunteering with foster youth and that adoption really “changes these kids lives.” She won’t even tell me WHY she’s doing this to me.

I’ve wondered if it’s an issue with her libido. She doesn’t tend to eat much, so I think there being health factors at play is on the table. At some point, I did ask her about the two of us getting checkups to make us super comfortable with trying stuff, but again, she refused . (To be fair, she really hates doctors, so maybe that was the wrong approach to take. Without getting into it too much, her parents were in the hospital a lot right before they died, so she has some bad memories.)

And honestly, nothing else has changed about her other than that. We still go on walks every week. We still go to the same cafes we used to. She still dresses like a librarian. Full sleeves, full pants, constantly. We live in California. The best I get is a bit of neck, but even if she wears a skirt (long, of course), she has a thick pair of leggings beneath it. She may even be wearing *more* layers beneath it, because when I hug her, I sometimes notice an extra padding around her abdomen. Does she really not want me touching her that badly? 

Hopefully you can see my side of things. Even if you think I’m a worthless hornball, you have to have some kind of advice on the situation. Waiting for this long was exciting, but now it doesn’t look like it’ll ever happen, and it’s been driving me crazy. I’d feel awful throwing nearly a decade down the drain over my dick, but it just doesn’t feel like I’m getting what I need out of this relationship.

TL;DR: I waited to have sex with my wife until after marriage, and yet she's still taking extreme measures to avoid sleeping with me. Does she hate me that much? Is she some kind of traumatized? Is she seeing other men behind my back? If anyone has some insight, or they have any recommendations on what to do next, please let me know.",1,1745738475.0,relationship_advice,23,0.6,False
1k8y7np,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k8y7np/aitah_for_making_my_older_brothers_life_miserable/,AITAH for making my older brother’s life miserable ?,"-Student, 19

- About to move out for college, want to enjoy my hometown and home one last semester

- Older brothers (29 and 27) move back in after a brief 2 month period which was supposedly “moving out for good” (turned out it wasn’t)

- I observe them being lazy and relying on my mother for everything, and I mean everything : food , rent, they practically have no expenses whatsoever 

- Things around the house start to tear and break down due to usage (microwaves, water boilers) 

-Broken down things remain that way for up to months due to my mom rightfully not wanting to fix them and my brothers start using cheap alternatives or just blatantly don’t care 

- I recognize the difficulty of the job market and overall economic landscape, so I accept they stay with the condition they at least help with chores like cleaning & repairing

- They finally start to wash their clothes, dishes (done rarely and poorly) and buy their groceries [we have to point out the good things as well]

- Despite this advancement , the lazy and unhelpful attitude remains the same , primarily due to a Gym hobby my brother takes very serious (he’s tired all the time 🙄) and the other being defensive all the time


-The money which one of them earns on his remote job is used WEEKLY to buy things off amazon, books , camera equipment, collection knives, clothes 


- My mother never asks for money , only when she deems fair (broken down microwave , etc) 


- When money is asked by my mom, a resistant unhelpful attitude is given in response . amounts are sometimes less than what would be $20 dollars for repairs.

- I notice all this, I naturally start to develop resentment

- I discuss it with them once , but they fall back to their old habits 

- My mother after giving her whole life to this children taking them all around the city when they didn’t have a car (they had a car till 27-28) , after she had invested in their entrepreneurial journeys: a coffee brand , supplement brand , etc , grows tired as well and starts voicing it out 


- I stop talking with them like I used to and gradually develop resentment towards them


- Since they work from home, from the moment I open my eyes in the morning I hear them yapping downstairs on a full time shift of 8 hours which I’ve found annoying and added to the resentment


- This is where the AITA question comes in, after seeing nothing else worked I start to simply call it out as I see it:


- I start to have heated discussions with them about not contributing anything whatsoever and even calling them parasites

- After the heated discussions I give them the full on rejection treatment, if they’re in the kitchen I wait till they’re done, if I’m in the kitchen I leave immediately 


- Since the people I love most are my parents and I have thought for a long time I’ll kill myself after they pass (this may sound corny but I mean it, they’re the sole reason I get up from the bed in the morning) , this parasitic issue consumes practically all my thought throughout the day and night


- The resentment grows large



- There’s incidents or fights practically daily and my mother grows tired of the incidents more than the laziness and unwillingness to help of my brothers 

- I make out my rejection toward them so evident each time they’re present, that my mother asks me to stop , she says  it’s affecting her health. 


- I finally agree to stop making my brothers life miserable with this evident rejection I display towards them, many times aggressively.


- The day I agree to put an end to it, one of my brothers was Hyper-sensitive to the rejection he was used to, when in reality mentally I was prepared to move past that and help my mother any way I could since her asking me to stop was a recent thing 


- I go downstairs and ignore him really, but when I walk past him , he sensed I was attacking him (I wasn’t) and started behaving like a gorilla trying to punch me.


- Me , being 21 now (I skipped some things but very briefly:  I know i can’t put blame on an event or object , but this issue drained me mentally to the point that I lost my scholarship at the #1 rated college in my country, followed by a permanent discharge, I’m still looking to resume my studies in august in another school tho) 

-Anyway , as I stated, if anyone’s ever had a fight so dramatic that it feels like a point of no return that’s what it felt like , he out of all people started calling me a parasite since I was discharged of school due to poor performance and wasn’t really doing much but actively looking for a job and doing online courses until I resumed my studies in august. 

-I couldn’t bear the cynicism for him to call me that, my energy was depleted so I didn’t say nothing new really, just the usual ‘you’re 32 , you don’t pay rent, you don’t pay electricity, etc’ 


-My mother was present all the time which is definitely what I regret most, I want her to be alive as long as possible and I don’t want to put stress on her like that but what other time would’ve been good to say those things? 


Anyways,, AITA????

I have moved to Copenhagen 4 months ago. I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science and 3 years of working experience in the IT. For the past 2 years I have been working as an IT Consultant - mostly writing backend code - Java, through a third company on a very large danish IT consultancy company projects.

I have applied to more than 200 job ads in the past 5 months and I can tell that I struggle to find a job and I am not so optimistic. I started working at WOLT, but the earnings are so low, and the busy hours that you can actually make money are very few in a day. I started feeling the pressure of spending all my savings not being able to sustain myself.

Everybody that I talk to talks about networking, and that this is the most important thing in Denmark's market, but there are 2 things that I don't like about that.

First of all, I really want to get to know other people, BUT I don't want to feel like I am taking advantage of them to find a job. I would like to meet other developers of course and learn more about them, their jobs, their companies, but I feel bad to have in mind that one of the factors is to help me find a job. I also like playing football, basketball, tennis, hiking, motorcycles (don't have one in Denmark) and of course drinking coffee.

Secondly, I don't know how to do the networking. For example I didn't find any group-chat or whatever with developers in CPH. I checked sites like meetup, but still I don't think there are a lot of options. I tried to attend IT-career day, but of course nothing more like typical conversations happen there. I though of course that way would be to just attend any social events that might interest me - but again I don't want to ""hope"" that someone from the guys I'll meet will ""refer"" me to a good job. I feel like this approach would also mean to try and meet more and more people until achieving a goal, which sounds exhausting - and of course there is a capacity in my social battery.

  
That was everything, thanks in advance for sharing any thoughts or ideas. Wish you a great Sunday, enjoy the Spring ",4,1745738071.0,NewToDenmark,2,0.83,False
1k8y3s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1k8y3s8/its_ridiculous/,It's ridiculous,"I just received a message from a guy I haven't talked to for 4 years now. We went on couple of dates and then he just disappeared. And then he just randomly pops up again, pretending to care how I've been and wanting to catch up over coffee or drinks. Of course, first making sure if I am not married or anything. 

If we would have parted ways amicably and it was two sided, it would have been fine. He was a cool guy, I liked him, but dude just ghosted me. And I see that with so many guys. Why do they do that? Obviously, I told him 'Thanks, but I am not interested.' but I am feeling so irritated. Do they really think that circling back after 2 or 4 years makes me forget they were kind of a dick? Also, it comes across almost desperate? Like, you have no one else to ask out on a date but a girl you once ghosted? Seriously?

And if you didn't like me enough back then what makes me think you are gonna like me enough this time around? Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, as they say.

1k8y32r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1k8y32r/does_gnmn_v7_wireless_earbuds_deliver_exceptional/,Does GNMN V7 wireless earbuds deliver exceptional sound and performance? Full review inside,"The GNMN V7 earbuds made their way into my daily routine a few weeks ago, and they’ve been through a lot with me—gym sessions, long commutes, late-night Netflix binges, and even the odd coffee spill. With features like IPX7 waterproofing, 96 hours of playback, and Bluetooth 5.3, this product promises plenty on paper. But does it deliver? I've been using them extensively, and here’s my take on what stands out and what doesn’t.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing you’ll notice about these wireless earbuds is the over-ear hooks. I will admit, I was skeptical about whether they'd stay secure during my workouts. But after attempting burpees, sprints, and even a quick yoga session, they didn’t budge! The soft yet sturdy hooks really do the job, making them perfect for fitness enthusiasts. The earbuds themselves have a sleek black finish, lightweight plastic build, and a snug in-ear fit, which adds to the comfort. The IPX7 waterproofing is a game-changer, especially if you’re an avid runner or someone who sweats buckets during workouts. I even wore them during a light drizzle, and they held up without any issues.

**Immersive Audio Experience**  
The sound performance was a pleasant surprise. These earbuds boast 16mm speaker drivers, which translate into clear highs, deep bass, and rich mids. My Spotify playlist has never sounded better. Bass-heavy tracks like “Lose Yourself” have depth, while acoustic sets like “Live at the Deluxe” maintain clarity. Phone calls are crystal clear, even in somewhat noisy environments thanks to the large chamber acoustic design minimizing sound leakage. Whether I was catching up on podcasts or blasting EDM tracks at the gym, the audio quality exceeded my expectations.

[Check GNMN V7 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0dy6yydd9/)  

**Battery Life and Charging Case**  
Battery life is often a dealbreaker for earbuds, but this isn’t a concern with the GNMN V7. A single charge gets me about 8 hours of playtime, which is more than sufficient for a day’s use. The charging case provides an additional 96 hours of playback, which is *insane*. What I loved is the dual LED display showing the exact battery levels for both the case and the earbuds. The Type-C fast-charging feature ensures I don’t have to wait long when the battery is low. The convenience is undeniable.

**Auto Pairing and Connectivity**  
Pairing took me all of five seconds; it’s ridiculously seamless. The earbuds auto-connect as soon as I popped them out of the charging case, which saved me the usual Bluetooth hassle. The Bluetooth 5.3 kept the connection stable whether I was streaming music while cooking or pacing around a busy gym. Low latency was noticeable during YouTube binge-watching and gaming, which honestly impressed me. For anyone looking to use just one earbud at a time, the mono mode is a thoughtful addition.

**Touch Controls and Ease of Use**  
Touch controls are something I either love or hate, depending on how well they’re implemented. With the GNMN V7, navigating playback and volume felt natural after just a bit of trial and error. I personally liked how I could manage calls and skip tracks with simple taps. It’s definitely more intuitive and less straining than physical buttons. However, the controls might take a second to respond on rare occasions, which was a little frustrating.

**Benefits**  
- Superb fit with secure over-ear hooks for intense activities.  
- Long playback time and convenient LED battery display.  
- Clear highs, deep bass, and balanced audio quality.  
- Effortless auto-pairing and stable connection through Bluetooth 5.3.  
- IPX7 waterproofing withstands sweat and rain.  

**Critiques**  
- Touch controls can lag slightly, especially with quick, repeated taps.  
- The plastic build, while lightweight, might not feel premium to everyone.  

**Competing Products**  
In the crowded world of wireless earbuds, it’s hard not to compare this model with others like the Beats Powerbeats Pro and Jabra Elite Active 75t. Unlike these premium options, the GNMN V7 focuses on a functional design without a steep price tag. For instance, the Beats earbuds do have slightly better sound quality and noise isolation features, but they also cost significantly more. The Jabra pair, known for their durability and compact design, match closely on waterproofing but fall short in battery life when compared to the GNMN V7. For anyone prioritizing cost-efficiency and sporty performance, these earbuds hold their own.

**Quality for Price**  
Considering the feature set—IPX7 waterproofing, extended battery life, and solid sound output—the value aspect is undeniable. You’re getting some of the highlights seen in high-end earbuds at a budget-friendly price. This makes the GNMN V7 a no-brainer for fitness enthusiasts, joggers, or anyone who wants a worry-free, long-lasting option for daily use.

1k8y2k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k8y2k2/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_sudden_bbq_plans/,AITA for ruining my sister's sudden BBQ plans?,"Hi fellow potatoes and our lovely queen potato! ❤️ I love reading these stories, and I now have one for myself 😅 and it's probably a long one, so sorry!!

I know how the title sounds, and I do feel like I am the asshole, but at the same time I feel like my own boundaries were pushed as well, so I am posting this here to figure it out, am I really the asshole? Or was setting boundaries a good thing to do?

This might be a long story about a perhaps silly argument, but I have to get it off my chest and figure out whether I'm in the wrong here or not. 

So earlier today my sister got locked inside her house with their family's puppy since her husband and their two kids went away for the day and took both sets of keys with him by accident. So she texts me exactly that, and I tell her that I'd be over with the keys in a little while since I live about a block away.

So after some time I arrive with my keys, and keep her company for a while, we have some coffee and sit in the yard when someone starts playing loud music. So I jokingly said ""I could go for a party"" and about 30 seconds later, I mention how I take back my words and not like a party instead because I wouldn't be able to/feel comfortable since my health condition (I have early stage 4 heartfailure due to a born heart condition getting worse, and I get tired very easily, even when sitting down) and that I would prefer to stay at home with her since I am also autistic and find a lot of gatherings very overstimulating, making me likely even more exhausted. We laugh it off and just enjoy the sun outside. This is probably where I made a massive mistake though, I probably shouldn't have mentioned said first thing in the first place.

Fastforward an hour or 2, one of her friends with her son rings the doorbell, and they join for coffee and juice, nothing wrong here and we have a good time. But a little while later, my sisters husband and their 2 kids come back, and also invited another young kid (a friend of my youngest cousin) to dinner, after which the 2 other guests alongside myself also get invited to dinner. 
I mention I'd rather go home since I am quite tired already and with all the extra noises rather overstimulated though the offer was really nice of her.

This is where the drama starts, so I mention this, and my sister sighs loudly and rolls her eyes and she walks inside. 
Her friend sitting next to me tells me it's good to be honest, and my sister then says she changed the plan because the neighbors were doing a backyard BBQ (so this is easily over 10 adults, their multiple dogs and pups and 7 or 8 children who are invited, not taking into account the neighbors who might show up because of the bbq sounds and smells, as well as our now formed group of adults and children. 
I tell her again that I was already planning on going home, and she rolls her eyes again, putting her phone down and says: 'fine, this was way more convenient, but for you I cancelled to go to the bbq, just so you know, it was way easier with the kids'. 

At this point I am confused because I mentioned several times already that I'd like to go home since I was already tired, and she proceeds to tell me that I did not say that, that I wished for a party, and that I was talking behind her back to her friend based on her hearing her say ""it's good to be honest"". 
I then tell her that all that was said was in earshot of her, and that I already told her everything that I told the friend, at which point my sister calls me inside and commands me to close the door to the yard and starts lecturing me how it's her house, how I always cause drama when her friends are over, how I ruined her plans, and that I embarrassed her in front of her friend.. this really hurt, I didn't want to do so, so I can't really hold back my sad/guilty/angry tears, and not wanting to cause a further scene I go to the bathroom to dry my eyes and clean up so I don't have a red face the entire evening since at this point, I felt like it was best to stay to stop the drama from going on even more. 

By this time the friend gets a call from her mother to pick something up for her, so she tells that and mentions she'd be back in a little while, so with all the children now playing up stairs, and the friend gone, my sister goes on arguing about how my illness always comes in first place, that I always make it known I'm ill, and that I never hear her complain about the small pains she has (which spoiler alert, she talks about quite frequently, and that's okay and valid too!), and this is where I snap. I tell her that even though her pains are valid, it's different than being exhausted 24/7 from a failing heart, that I can't exactly control being audibly out of breath, the coughing, and that it's visible that I hold a lot of fluid, and that I didn't talk behind her back, I don't want to cause a scene, and that even though the dinner offer was nice, I already mentioned I wanted to go home, even prior to the BBQ plan. 
This was apparently the last straw for my sister, and she starts crying saying that I purposefully always say no to gatherings with her friends, that she just wants to make memories because I'm her only sister, and that she always does everything to keep everyone happy. 
At this point I am literally overwhelmed and just feel guilty, so I as well cry with her, after which she mentions that I am always the victim. 
So I apologize for her cancelling her plans and tell her she should still go with her children and their friends to that BBQ, but that I'd rather not attend, but would if she wanted to join in, but then another rage filled comment gets thrown my way about how she already cancelled and that she'd read the text to me what she sent, because ""she wouldn't thow me under the bus in front of her friends"".

The friend from earlier now comes back, and my sister drops the yelling and greets her happily back and starts making dinner, making a huge deal about how the children and adults are seperated with dinner for ""some people"" not to get overstimulate, and then we head into the yard. At this point I feel a mixture of sadness, guilt, and also a bit upset because I feel like I didn't necessarily make a fuss, or a drama, but I just wanted to go home, but apparently my face is an open book (oops) and when we sit down, she says in front of all the adults: so, we're friends now? I agree and eat my dinner and pretend that I feel okay, but I actually really, did not. 

2 hours later again (at 8pm or so) the friend with her son leaves, and the other child (which is also a neighbor) goes home and the bedtime ritual for her own kids start. I say good night to her kids, hug them and they are off to bed, and my sister joins the table where I'm sitting saying ""I still want to discuss what happened"". At this point I am over it, and exhausted after the day and just hear her out, not saying a lot and she seemed okay with that.
10 pm hits, and I am going home, I just feel so much guilt.. but also, I feel like I can also sometimes say no to things and I feel a bit hurt that my illness is the problem for everything. I know she has a lot on her plate, and she already mentioned some time ago that she felt like she was always left behind growing up because I was Ill, which completely sucks, and I feel for her because every child deserves the same amount of attention and caring and back then we both agreed it was neither our faults. But still my illness keeps being a thing that gets in the way of our relationship I feel. 

so this is where my story comes to close, and I have to ask, am I the asshole? Or was setting boundaries a good thing? Because honestly, I feel really guilty. I have already texted her I didn't mean to blow off her plans, and she replied it doesn't matter, but it eats away at me.



To add:
I just wanted to mention that the BBQ was nothing formal, it was just a neighborhood BBQ where everyone can bring their own stuff and enter as they please.
Also, my sister is generally a very nice person, and I think that she might feel like she always has to make sure that I am okay with my illness, so I do understand how that's heavy on her, and that with us growing up I got a lot of attention, while she had to be the sister of an ill person (those who get it, get it). That being said, she always wants to take care of me, and help me, and I am very thankful for her in my life and I love her very much.

The way my store operates is that when in a rush the person in drive through would cash the people out at the  window and pull them forward into designated spot for drinks and food to be ran out to them.

I worked the bagel station, and ""M"" worked drive through once my tickets for bagel were finished I was called to the front where we placed tickets for cars that have been pulled forward waiting on thier items. The runner questioned whether or not this car received their food,they had been waiting for a while. I remember making the bagel and called for ""M"" to see if he had forgotten to give it to the customer. In between our confusion and chatting, the runner went out to check if the customer did receive their bagel. ""M"" went back to handling drive. The food runner came back and told me that everything was fine and that the customer had already gotten food. ""M"" had forgotten to cross out the item on the ticket, a common mistake at my job.

Here is where I might be the asshole. I notified ""M"" that the food situation had been cleared up and that he could continue to pull, which had stopped due to the confusion causing wait time to go up considerably. ""M"" stated that it was too much confusion with bagels, and we weren't pull forward until we figured out what happened to the missing bagel. ""M"" then asks about other bagels and whether I provided him with the right bagel for the right cars. To which I reiterate that yes, every car got the right bagel and that we can continue pulling cars. ""M"" continues to question me about other customers' previous orders unwilling to pull forward due to the confusion of possibly of giving the wrong car the wrong food item. This is when I raise my voice a little. I said, "" I've repeated this four times already, the bagel went to the right car, so have all other previous bagels."" I was really irritatedly at that stage. A common thing we say at my work is to open up those listening ear when someone wasn't paying attention to thier job so I told ""M""Open up those listening ears I've repeated this four times how many times are going to go in circles? ""M"" simply says he's sorry and that he wanted to stop the line to clear confusion, which I retorted back that ""You're the only one confused right now.""

This is when my assistant manager steps in after listening to me and ""M"" talk basically telling me I was being too hard on ""M.""  After that, I backed off and privately texted my friend, asking should I apologize she also saw what happened with me and ""M. "" She states I shouldn't, but she is baised. She doesn't like ""M."" I've asked my family about this. My mother thinks I'm wrong stating I treated ""M"" like a child, but my siblings think I don't think I owe ""M"" an apology.

**What is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 word limit)**

It's common sense. 

We assume things are inherently true based solely on tradition and individual experience without seeking empirical evidence. All progress has been and will be made by challenging the status quo and our preconceived notions of truth.

**What historical moment or event do you wish you could have witnessed? (50 word limit)**

The domestication of *Coffea arabica*. 

I would like the answer to the age-old question: Were people seeking out coffee for the caffeine kick or did we selectively breed for “notes of black cherry, dark chocolate and caramel?”  

Did we humans shape nature in pursuit of pleasure or productivity? 

**What is the best compliment you have received? Who gave you this compliment? (50 word limit)**

""I think we must have been friends in a past life."" 

This was told to me by one of my dearest patients from when I worked at a memory care facility, now deceased. If there is such a thing as reincarnation, I hope we meet a third time.

**List five things that are important to you. (50 word limit)**

**The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning. (100 to 250 words)**

From watercolors to singing to crocheting to gardening, I've always had a habit of ""collecting hobbies.” I’ve found the act of learning each new skill a thrill in itself. Each one presents its own set of unique challenges and joys, teaching me to grow in different ways. 

At some point, I adopted this mindset into my academic career. I took a wide range of classes, from Anthropology, to Math, to Public Health. Before I knew it, my collection of hobbies included a collection of five Associate’s degrees, making me a certified jack of all trades. 

That being said, I worried I was becoming a master of none. Before I was able to brew the perfect cup of oolong tea or discover the intimate secrets of the Krebs Cycle, I was diving into the next project.

However, after joining ----- Ceramics studio, I met artists who experimented with many mediums, many careers even. Seeing them combine skills in unexpected ways inspired me to marry hobbies to academia, resulting in handbuilt plates that depict the evolutionary history of plants and an adventure in sourdough starter microscopy. I found myself downright giddy at all of the new possibilities.

Looking back, my “collections” aren't signs of indecision, but a reflection of my love of learning. 

On my non-linear path, I’ve discovered that what excites me most isn’t learning new things in itself; rather, my gifts lie not in the mastery of one, but in finding the intersections of ideas, disciplines, and people.

I'd love to hear some of your guy's responses to these questions!!! Best of luck to all of us, no matter what happens, we will end up at the right place :)

The idea is pretty simple: place a self-serve, hot-and-cold coffee machine inside high-traffic locations like airports, colleges, or even a Walmart.

I have two paths in front of me:
	1.	Work with a small franchisor — They don’t touch my sales. Instead, they finance the machine (zero interest), supply the products (that’s how they make money), and charge a $100 monthly support fee. Less risk, faster launch, but less control.
	2.	Build it 100% independently — Source my own machine, supply my own coffee, develop my own small tech stack (payment system + remote tracking). Way harder, but I’d fully own the brand and margins long-term.

Bonus twist:
Instead of starting in a huge city like LA, I’m thinking about testing it in my small hometown — and maybe even landing a Walmart or mall placement first to control traffic and test the model cheap.

Curious: if you were me, would you lock in the structure for speed… or build it slow and own everything?
And if you’ve done vending or retail ops — what’s the one mistake you’d avoid at the start?

Sorry the title isn’t the best, I’m new to this Reddit stuff. The reason I ask if this is trauma is because I don’t want to throw that word out for something that could be a minor thing. But I’m struggling to move on from this after years. 

I’m 19 years old, and when I was 8 years old my parents split up. I honestly wasn’t too affected by this for some reason but that’s not important. My mom met my step dad when I was 10 years old, it took a while for me to warm up to him and feel comfortable around him. I mean like I totally hated this guy, not because of him but because he was dating my mom. After a while I became somewhat close with him and enjoyed having him around. 

 But he had a drinking problem. I don’t think my mom drank a lot before she met him, nor did she smoke weed. Once they started dating she smoked weed and would drink. Which not a big deal that’s not the issue. I would start to babysit my sister a lot of nights so they could go out, I watched my sister a lot (she has a disability) so this wasn’t difficult. But usually they would get home from anywhere between 11pm-2am. Almost everytime they got back I heard them arguing. It started off as just yelling at each other. 

 Over time it was my step dad throwing stuff, breaking things, punching walls and doors etc. I know for a fact he would never EVER get physical with my mom. Just objects to let out his anger I guess. I would get super upset and cry everytime this happened, I would text my mom asking them to go outside or to be quiet, which didn’t really do anything they would be quieter for a little but be loud again screaming at eachother. This would also happen a lot on weekdays so I had school the next day. 

There was this one specific time that scared me a lot. They were arguing and screaming at eachother as per usual, I heard him start to punch the wall and doors, hear him throw a pill bottle and pills went everywhere, throwing a bunch of stuff. They went into the basement, still screaming and I heard my mom say “just hit me, just fucking punch me in the face I know you want to”, I heard him say he would never do that and “why the fuck would you say that” whatever. But then I heard him little just scream, no words just scream, and grabbed our glass coffee table and throw it on to the floor I assume and I heard it shatter everywhere. I’m honestly not sure how the neighbours didn’t call the cops, I mean maybe they did I just didn’t know. 

I would wake up the next morning after all of these arguments, cleaning up everything. Cleaned up the beer cans, cleaned up all of the Advil pills, all of the stuff that was thrown around. I would get my sister breakfast and had to act like nothing happened to my mom. But I could tell she was upset. I felt so bad but there was nothing I could do. This happened all the way until I was 17 years old and I moved in with my dad. 

Now they have both stopped drinking, unless it’s a special occasion and even then it’s not a lot. They are happily married, and I assume in a much better place. But I feel like I never got to recover from this, I didn’t talk to anyone about this, never talked to my mom about it. Just kinda had to pretend nothing happened. And I just don’t know what to do. I’m super super close with my mom now, I don’t think I can talk to her about it because I just don’t want to make her feel bad. Or make her feel as if she was a bad parent. I’ve considered therapy but don’t really know how to get in to it or if there’s even a point. 

Anyways sorry that this was a long post, if you have any suggestions for me please let me know and it will be greatly appreciated.

I'll give an example - yesterday we went out for coffee in the morning. We were having good conversation, laughing a lot, dog and people watching. Suddenly he becomes dead quiet. I ask him what's wrong, he says nothing. About an hour and a half later, after more prompting from me and more cold treatment from him, he tells me that over coffee I had overexplained something and treated him like he was stupid.

For reference, he has said this a few times, usually with regards to me being passionate to speak about something. My family, friends and colleagues all appreciate this about me and never see my investment in conversation as condescending. Even if they did, they'd find a way to address it without giving me the silent treatment, but my partner can't regulate his emotions. Sometimes he will be quiet for a whole evening without telling me what's wrong.

In the afternoon, we grabbed a bite before the gym. I asked him if he could be brilliant at any sport, which one he'd choose. He said F1; I said golf. I mentioned I don’t know much about F1 and that it doesn’t immediately strike me as a sport like, say, rugby does. He explained why it should be considered one, but what bothered me was how condescending he became. He made some points and I had some counterpoints, but he started cutting me off, insisting I was wrong, and talking down to me, saying I know nothing, telling me what a lame excuse of a sport golf is, all while I was just trying to learn more about him and a new topic through some light-hearted debating. At that point, it didn’t feel like he was trying to prove F1 was a sport anymore... it felt like he was trying to prove that I don’t know anything.

I asked him several times to just drop it. I said we just have different opinions and it's okay, but he said ""no, you don't just have a different opinion, you're wrong"" and then would continue ranting at me and telling me not to talk about things I know nothing about. I eventually cracked under the beratement and said, what's wrong with you? I've been asking you to drop it. He said I ""asked to drop it too late"" so I can't act like the better person (I don't understand this... I was trying to de-escalate before either of us got more upset).

He then didn't come to gym with me. He drank two drafts and drove home while I Ubered.

I'm tired of how common this is becoming. He often gets so upset over something so small that he won't speak to me for a whole day or will be rude to me.I would appreciate advice on how to communicate during these moments so that he doesn’t feel attacked, and how to set boundaries when conversations start escalating.


Tl;dr: My partner takes my passion and investment in conversation as an attack on his intelligence, and sees me having a different opinion to him as a personal attack. Looking for advice on how to navigate this better.",1,1745736945.0,u_ThrowRA65fy,0,1.0,False

For the last 5 years or so, I have felt a sort of rift in the way being with her feels. it’s harder to keep her interest, it’s harder to make her laugh, she doesn’t want to spend as much time with me. she is INCREDIBLY secretive. she was never like this in our youth.

within the last 2 years, she has holed herself in her house. she even moved to my hometown within that time which was so exciting to me knowing i would see her more. yet, she tells me she prides herself in her isolation. she’s destined to be a bachelorette forever - no one will ruin her routine. when i was living out of state, she would come to visit me intending to spend the night but would last minute pack to leave to “just be in her own bed” or “have her nightly ritual” and take the 2 hour drive back home after only a couple of hours at my new apartment.
her nightly ritual that she boasts about is a highly obsessive compulsive hours long event to rid herself of the day. 15 minutes to take off her makeup. 20 minutes to brush her teeth with multiple different products. one hour to take a shower with $70+ worth of hair products (she forgot at home for this trip btw) i’m all for self care, but if this is upset, her mood controls the situation. the air is decided by her comfortability. she becomes irritated and physically distressed. wether its the fabled nightly routine, or something like the hike the group agreed to go on today. it was very very windy and very very dusty - this messed up her hair and made her feel dirty. she left by herself to my car and ran my gas down for an hour while the rest of us finished, and then begged us to take her to an Ulta to buy her extra fancy products. 
in those 2 years, she has also very clearly had an eating disorder and severe body image issues. i watch her closely restrict her diet to keep at her ~115 pounds. she is a stick. boasts about how little she’s eaten - “oh, i know my eating disorder is coming back now that the weather is getting warmer!” “i’ve only had black coffee today!” she does not try to hide it. body checking. body checking. comments about her size. body checking. all. day. long. but “the control makes her feel good - it feels good to be empty - i like the way i look” these are all but a fraction of things she says every time i’m with her. body checking. and don’t get me started with her constant taking photos of herself. the hyper fixation on what she looks like. you’ll be caught dead if you’re caught with a photo of her she didn’t approve. her instagram is something off of a proana ED twitter account. 

she spent $1000 on a hotel the group did not agree on and expects us to pay the difference. she wanted it because it’s “clean and comfortable” and did it behind our backs because she knew we wouldn’t agree, and wouldn’t have a choice once it was set. it’s for HER comfort.
it’s her. her. her. her. all day, every time. 


today was the day i tried to gently bring it up to her. from a concerned friend and family member with so much love in the world. 
i’m angry. i’m angry to watch her destroy herself like this. not only is it selfishly annoying me in how much i go out of my way to still cater to her, watching the stress of something like taking a shower and the physical effects it’s taking on her body. her hair is falling out. her skin is terrible. IT IS MENTAL ILLNESS. The conclusion i can take away from her response is “she is not mentally ill, she’s not going to kill herself - YET.” (real words that left her mouth but tried to play off jokingly) 
she says, yes. she may have struggled with eating in the past but she doesn’t have an ED. yes she DOES have OCD tendencies. but she’s just a girl with certain tendencies and is very particular about her routines and i need to just leave her alone. she is “FINE”. i need to “back off”. she is fine. now is giving me the cold shoulder because i said it worries me to her tonight",1,1745736911.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

I've been on a keto diet for around 1 year. Prior to keto I had insulin resistance and high triglycerides. 

When I first started keto within 6 months my Triglycerides went to a normal range and my LDL and HDL increased. 

I did another cholesterol test at the 1 year mark and my triglycerides randomly went up - which i was not expecting ?! Weirdly my LDL went down? 

My recent results were : 

HDL 1.9nmol 
LDL 3.1 nmol
triglycerides 4.8 nmol ?!? 

I was shocked as in my last blood tests my triglycerides were 1.2nmol and my LDL was 4.3 and HDL 1.7 ?!? 

I'm so confused. I eat a very similar diet ?

The only thing that has changed is the fact that prior to this blood test I wasn't fasting. I was actually drinking a long black coffee with a slight dash of milk during my test and I think I had a light breakfast (probably just an avo and plain Greek yoghurt). 

I'm aware eating would affect it but it's almost x4 higher - I didn't think eating would affect it this significantly especially since I only ate low carb foods ? 


I was wondering - does this seem normal ? Does anyone know HOW much trigs should increase in a non fasted test compared to fasted ? Anyone had any experience or have info on this. I'm a bit worried.

1k8xt95,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8xt95,Choosing my first work+weekend bag (Alpaka / Black Ember / Able Carry),"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some opinions and real-world experiences with these bags. I’ll mainly be using the bag for work (90% of the time), but also for going out and short trips (like weekend travel). It’s my first time investing in a quality bag, and with a limited budget, I’m worried about making a choice I’ll regret.

What I need in a bag:
it has to fit my 17-inch gaming laptop (40 × 27 × 2.5 cm). I’ve already tried the Black Ember Citadel R3 25L and it fits with no problem. The other two, I’ve only researched online, but based on specs and reviews, they should fit too even if they’re not directly marketed for 17-inchers. It should fit my lunch container (max 15 cm wide depending on what I use). In my current bag, I have to awkwardly put my lunch container sideways just to make it fit. Lastly, it shouldn’t look too bulky or awkward for office use, especially on light load days.

Background on my current setup:
My current bag is a typical local 19L backpack. It has no dedicated laptop compartment (only a padded sleeve inside the main area), but it surprisingly fits my laptop and essentials on light days. However, on heavy days, I can’t fit everything — sometimes I even have to carry stuff by hand during my commute, which is a big hassle. That’s the main reason I’m upgrading.

Here’s my loadout:

Light days
	•	17-inch gaming laptop
	•	11-inch iPad
	•	Lunch container
	•	32 oz Owala bottle
	•	16 oz coffee tumbler
	•	Sweater
	•	Planner
	•	Small notebooks
	•	Chargers

Heavy days (everything above + extra items):
	•	98% mechanical keyboard
	•	Bulky laptop stand
	•	Mouse
	•	Office supplies (calculator, pens, hard drives, etc.)
	•	Additional cables

Bags I’m considering:
	•	Alpaka Elements Travel Backpack 35L
	•	Black Ember Citadel R3 25L
	•	Able Carry Max EDC 26L

I chose these mainly through researching online, watching videos, and reading reviews. A good warranty matters to me since I’m from the Philippines and there are no service centers here, and all of these brands seem to have solid support, and ships here.

In terms of aesthetics, I like all three bags equally even though their styles are pretty different. Also, water bottle pockets (whether inside, outside, or none) don’t matter to me — it’s not a dealbreaker either way. I also know that there's a big jump with the volume of my current bag, and the bags I listed. It isn't a big deal for me as long as it fits my stuff.

I just want to make sure I’m not missing anything important that might only be obvious through real-world use. Would appreciate hearing your experiences, especially regarding fit, comfort, organization, and durability!

<div>### Transforming Your Space with Spooky Accents

Creating an inviting yet eerie atmosphere starts with carefully chosen living room Halloween decor. Incorporate elements like flickering LED candles, cobwebs delicately draped over furniture, and plush throw pillows with ghostly prints to set the perfect mood. These accents blend comfort with festivity, ensuring your living area is both cozy and creepy.

### Using Color to Evoke Halloween Vibes

Color plays a crucial role in living room Halloween decor. Opt for a palette dominated by classic colors such as deep orange, black, and purple. Introduce these hues through blankets, rugs, and wall art featuring pumpkins, bats, and witches. This combination immediately signals the holiday spirit without overwhelming your living space.

### Creative Centerpieces That Captivate

A captivating focal point can be created with themed centerpieces. Consider a glass bowl filled with mini pumpkins, faux spiders, and string lights to illuminate the table. Alternatively, stack vintage books with eerie titles paired with small skull figurines to give your coffee table a haunted look.

### Incorporating Functional Decor

Functional items double as festive pieces when selecting living room Halloween decor. Think about using themed throw blankets that keep guests warm while enhancing the spooky ambiance. Decorative trays featuring skeletal hands or spiderweb patterns can serve as serving stations during Halloween gatherings.

- Switch out everyday cushions for Halloween-themed covers
- Display framed Halloween prints or vintage horror movie posters
- Add greenery with black-painted pumpkins or dried, dark foliage
- Use ambient lighting like orange-hued bulbs or lanterns
 
By combining these thoughtful touches, your living room will become the ultimate haunt for celebrating Halloween in style and comfort.

High cortisol is so bad.  Maybe i will lose this belly as well from better sleep and eating habits and lower cortisol over time.

Chapter 5 - (Arthur) The Peasant Captain

\-

*Outer Watchtower,*  
*Antares Royal Capital,*  
*Central Province*

Arthur leaned against the stone railing of the outer watchtower. His gloved fingers tightened. 

The Gilded Gate of Antares loomed in the distance. He could only obey the command, guarding the Royal Palace from afar despite his unanswered frustration.

He pulled his hand in as he felt the ring was loosening. A chuckle left his mouth. *That was almost a disaster.*

“You know, I would prefer you share the joke with me than enjoy it by yourself.” A voice broke his thought.

An arm extended, offering him a cup of hot and dark brown liquid. Arthur grabbed the cup, not realizing how hot that cup was.

“Thanks.” He stared at the ring. “Just thinking.”

Arthur sniffed the drink with narrowed eyes. “Is this safe?”

“This…” Tenha raised his cup “...is coffee. Enjoy it, you don’t get this every day.”

Arthur took a sip of the coffee.

Sour,  
Bitter,  
Most importantly, warm.

“What do you think? Tell me it’s not the best taste you’ve had.” Tenha asked.

“It’s alright, I guess.” He took another sip, not understanding how this weird-tasting concoction compelled him.

“It grows into you, trust me.” Tenha shrugged his captain’s indifferent attitude.

Arthur exhaled, deeply. He looked back to the window again.

Tenha took the place next to Arthur, “Just, don’t overthink it, captain.” He took another sip “God this is strong.”

“I wasn't,” Arthur answered briefly and stepped away from the window.

In the corner, a group of soldiers had set up a makeshift table, tossing dice and exchanging quiet laughter. Arthur frowned. He couldn’t understand them—these men, who could relax so easily in times of uncertainty.

Tenha sighed, following his captain again. ""You know, Arthur. There’s always a silver lining. At least now we can chill for a while.""

Arthur turned. ""It’s Captain. We’re on duty.""

Before Ten could reply, a runner arrived, breathless from climbing the tower steps. ""Captain Arthur, Commander Reinhardt is here. He wants to see you.""

Arthur exhaled, longer than usual. What does he want at this hour?

He dismissed the soldiers with a sharp order. ""Clear the room and go on a watch. Let the Commander through.""

The men exchanged wary glances before obeying. They quickly put away the dice and the makeshift table. Within minutes, all the soldiers had left the room and the heavy wooden door creaked open again.  
\-

Commander Reinhardt entered, eyes surveying the room with the casual confidence of a man who had nothing else to prove.

""Arthur, my boy,"" Reinhardt mused, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Arthur didn’t salute. Just stiffened. ""Commander, it’s unusual for you to come here at this hour. What’s the matter?""

Reinhardt chuckled, shaking his head. ""Straight to business, huh? No time to reminisce with your old man?""

That old warmth again. Smiling like he expected Arthur to come running. But he said nothing. ""Stay professional, Commander. We’re on duty,"" Arthur replied curtly.

Reinhardt sighed dramatically. ""Ha! Scolded by my own kid. You really have changed.""

*No. You’re the one who’s changed, Commander.*

""You didn’t come here just to talk,"" Arthur said. ""Why are you here?""

Reinhardt’s smirk faded. He walked to the weapons rack, running his hand across the hilt of a bastard sword.

""The Emperor’s decision to banish us from the palace still doesn’t sit right with me,"" he said, voice lowered.

Arthur scoffed. ""It’s those court mages, isn’t it? I’ve never trusted them.""

""Shh,"" Reinhardt warned, sharp and immediate. His gaze flicked toward the door as if someone might be listening.

“Why? Where’s the Mighty Commander Reinhardt that I know? You’re afraid to discuss this wrongness?” Arthur stood, voice raised against his father figure.

“Talk about being unprofessional to a superior officer, son.” Reinhardt scolded him, turning on Arthur.

Arthur’s spine stiffened. *Damn it.* He’d gone too far. He forced the words out through clenched teeth. “...Apologies, sir.”

""You’re being reassigned,"" Reinhardt added, stepping closer. ""There’s been an increase in beast activity beyond the city walls. Too many attacks. You're taking two platoons to patrol the three southern villages.""

Arthur stiffened. *Are you kidding me? This is why you came here?*

His fingers curled into fists, nails digging into his palms.

""Sorry, Commander?"" His voice was calm. ""This is nonsense. The capital could be in danger, the Emperor might need us, and you're sending me away?""

Reinhardt exhaled heavily, rubbing his temples. ""Yes, my son. There are enough soldiers in the capital. But the people beyond our walls aren't so lucky.""

""So what? I am sworn to protect the people in the capital, all the more reasons for me to stay in the city."" Arthur raised his voice.

""Ah yes, you are the sword of the Empire. But remember your vow. Do you need me to remind you what you promised?""

Arthur’s patience snapped.

“My vow to the commoners?! You bring this up now? I have my own to protect. In the palace. Not those—”

He stopped, a little bit too late.

Reinhardt’s gaze darkened. ""Those common folks? Those peasants? They are the backbone of this empire. Without them, there’s nothing left to protect.""

Arthur took a step forward, eyes blazing. ""I understand that commander. But in times like this, I’m just thinking—"" He stopped again, unsure how to express his thoughts clearly.

A dangerous silence stretched between them.

Then—Reinhardt laughed. A low, bitter laugh.

""Listen to yourself. I could've sworn you used to hate the thought of working for the nobles. Debbie sure did change you."" He muttered. ""I pulled you up. I trained you, taught you discipline, gave you a name, a purpose, a place to stand in this empire. And now you look down on the very people you came from?""

Arthur swallowed the rage rising in his throat. So, after everything I’ve done for you, I’m still just some peasant you graciously lifted from the mud.

""I worked for my place,"" he hissed. ""I earned it. Unlike them.""

Reinhardt’s eyes narrowed. ""Then prove it.""

Arthur frowned. ""What?""

Reinhardt stepped forward, his voice low, tired of Arthur’s antics.

""Prove to me that you can be more than a bitter fool with a sword. Go to the villages. Protect them. Lead like the soldier I trained you to be.""

Arthur hated how Reinhardt always framed it as a challenge—always manipulating him into obedience.

""Or,"" Reinhardt continued, crossing his arms, ""you can keep sulking like a child, refusing orders because you didn’t get what you wanted.""

Arthur’s hands trembled. He wanted to argue, to throw Reinhardt’s words back in his face.

But he couldn’t, because defying a direct order meant insubordination. And Arthur wasn’t weak. He wouldn’t be seen as weak.  
His jaw locked as he saluted stiffly. ""…Understood, sir.""

Reinhardt held his gaze for a moment longer. Then, with a weary sigh, he turned away. ""Get some rest, Arthur. You leave at dawn.""

Arthur didn’t move as the commander walked away, the door creaking shut behind him. Only when he was alone did he exhale, his grip on his sword tightening until his knuckles turned white. *This isn’t over.*

*-*

*Outer City Gate,*   
*At Dawn.*

The sky was still smeared with the last traces of night. Two platoons stood ready near the gate, armor quiet, horses restless.

Arthur still felt the fatigue from not sleeping well. He walked toward Tenha, who was cinching the last strap on his saddle.

“Nuts?” Tenha asked without looking up—he always knew when Arthur was near.

Arthur took one. “Thanks. I appreciate that you have no problem coming with me. I'm very sorry you’re getting dragged into this mess.”

Tenha turned, brushing his fringe back with a flick before resting both hands on his sword hilt. He let out a long breath. “What’s with this sentimental crap?”  
A beat. Then a grin. “Just bark the order, captain. Like you always do.”

Arthur shook his head, smiling.

“Also where’s your damn cloak, don’t sully the name of—” Tenha looked behind Arthur, “Anyway, you got company.” He pointed with his mouth.

Arthur looked back, A small figure in a flowing nightgown rushed toward him, brown curls spilling over her shoulders. ""Arthur, honey, where are you going?""

Before Arthur could answer, the girl threw herself into his arms, clutching him tightly. He embraced her back, feeling the warmth of her body, ""How did you know about this operation?""

""Your father told me,"" she sniffled. ""He said I might want to say goodbye… he was laughing when he said that.""

Arthur scowled. *Of course, he would tell her and laugh.*

She buried her face against his chest deeper. "" I want things to go back to normal… I want us to go back.""

“Don’t worry, love. Everything’s under control. You’re betrothed to the best captain, remember? Safest girl in all of Allegria.”

He showed her his ring. “Where’s yours?”

Debbie sniffled and held up her hand, revealing the simple silver ring with a rough carving of their initials.

Arthur smiled faintly, pressing a kiss to her forehead. “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, Debbie.”

Her lips trembled. “You too, Arthur. You too.”

Their kiss lingered—slow, reluctant. The kind that doesn’t want to end.

Tenha cleared his throat. “We need to go, Captain.”

The soldiers were already mounted. Silent. Ready.

A black-furred Lupin approached, holding out Arthur’s cloak—deep black, embroidered with a silver drake’s head. He helped Arthur into it. Arthur reached for it. The fabric was heavier than it looked. Cold, too. He slid his arms in without a word.

Debbie stepped back.

Arthur whistled. A spectral drake, much smaller than the actual mystical beast, shimmered into view—white, lean, saddled, and armed. His greatsword rested at its flank.

He mounted the drake and raised a hand. No words. Just a signal to his platoons.

Behind him, armor shifted. Hooves tapped stone. The two platoons moved, slow and steady.

“Get home soon, my love!” Debbie’s voice chased him, thin and fraying in the wind.

Arthur’s hands tightened on the reins. Just a twitch. Barely visible.

Next to him, Tenha let out a sharp breath through his nose. “A noble lady falling for your peasant’s ass that hard?” he said, riding up with a half-glance.

He nudged his mount closer and adjusted the strap on his pauldron. “Arthur Regus, you’re the luckiest son of a bitch alive.”

Arthur didn’t answer right away.

He blinked slowly. A breath fogged out. His glove flexed once around the hilt at his side—then relaxed.

A smile crept in, thin and crooked.

Not for Tenha.  
Not for her.  
Just for him.

“You’re right,” he murmured. “Maybe things aren’t that bad after all.”

1k8xk4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k8xk4z/am_i_understanding_things_wrong_because_of/,Am i understanding things wrong because of cultural differences or are we just not compatible.,"Hi i just want to start by saying im not good with the English language nor am i a good writer but i hope i provide my situation and story with as much clarity as possible. Sorry if it gets too long. 

Charlotte youve gotten me through some rough nights at work. Thank you ! I listen to you while i work and when i sleep as asmr hahaha. 

Ive been in a relationship with this girl for the past 6 months. Lets call her jane. And it was great and amazing at first you know the cute dates and stuff. Shes kind and caring and smart. And i love the way she smiles when she sees cute stuff like puppies and capybaras.

Anyways, We decided to live together last 3 months ago and thats when things started to change. We have had alot of arguments and misunderstandings mostly because of cultural differences. Im from the Philippines and shes from the US. 

One example of misunderstandings is the N word. I am fully aware how sensitive that word is here in the US so i never say that word ever since living here. In the Philippines, that word is very common and was never looked at a bad way like thats how me and my friends call each other in the Philippines. It never was a negative thing. We even have places called negritos in our country. Anyways it really didnt mean anything bad.  But again i am aware of how bad and sensitive it is here in the US so i never say that. 

Long story short, me and her are both gamers and i have this discord group. They are my friends from the Philippines and all of them that are there are Filipinos. Weve known each other for the longest time more than 15 years. I wanted to introduce her to them by inviting her to the discord group. She never came in the voice chat and was very mad at me. She started telling me stories about her ex saying that oh he said he wasnt racist but after living with him for 2 years his true colors showed and he was actually a racist and then she raised her voice asking me if I was racist and just tell her now before we continue this. I was dumbfounded and shocked like i couldnt even say anything. I asked her where is all that she was saying coming from. Apparently when i invited her to the group, the first thing she did was search my name on the search bar in that group and saw that i chatted my friend the N word 2 years ago. It was me inviting him to join us play a game. 

I was still in the process of trying to understand why she did that in the first place but i tried to explain my side that im not racist and us friends call each other that. That from where i grew up it was never a bad thing. She wouldnt believe me and kept disregarding the things i was saying. We ended up not talking for a few days. I was devastated. I felt like i couldnt defend my self. She called me back after a few days saying she now understands that the N word is normal in my culture. Like it didnt mean any bad. She said she did her research and all. And that she was only asking me if im racist because she was  warning me not to say it here in the US. She was just protecting me is what she said. That kind of confused me because it felt like i was being accused with how she reacted at first and then now shes saying shes just protecting me. I feel like im being gaslighted or something i dont know. I told her that i know its sensitive thats why i dont say that word anymore ever since coming to the US. She kept saying “i know i know im just warning you. Dont say it coz youll get in trouble with other people”. I told her i knooww ill get in trouble thats why im not saying the word. She just kept repeating saying she was just warning me. She said shes sorry its her fault. Shes not okay health wise. And that i be patient with her. Its her fault. Shes sorry. 

Anyhow I just kept quiet and let it be. I didnt want to dig any deeper or make that conversation longer coz it felt like it was going nowhere. 

So thats the first time i noticed that behavior where her initial reaction doesnt coincide with what she says she means. Like im just confused.

The second time i noticed. Was when i made her breakfast tofu and scrapple with sunny side eggs. Because she loves that. She always makes it that way. Anyways She didnt eat it in the morning and said that she will eat it at lunch or dinner. So i said okay thats fine no biggie. Come dinner she ordered tacos and other stuff. She ended up not eating the food i made. I was wondering why she didnt eat it. So i asked her if she was the type that only eats what she craves? Like shes only up for what shes craving for? Idunno how to ask this question. But she did say no shes not like that she said shes just very particular with the flavor of the tofu that she eats and thought that what i made tasted weird. She asked me how i made it. I told her exactly the way she makes it everytime. And then she asked me to tell her the steps i did. I said sautee onion garlic with todu add Soy sauce and sugar. Its the same thing she makes. She asked me how many packets of sugar i used, i said 1 and she said “ohh that must be why its weird because i use 3 packets not 1.”. I said oh i didnt know that im sorry and i said okay ill eat it then coz i didnt want the food to go to waste so thats what i ate for dinner. 

When i was done washing the dishes, she came to the kitchen and said can we talk about a while ago. I said yeah sure what about a while ago. She said “i dont need you commenting on what i eat, im an adult and i can eat whatever i want. If i dont want to eat tofu thats fine i can anything i want im an adult. I see you go to wawa everynight before going to work and you dont see me commenting on that. Yes i know your wawa trips. You dont see me commenting on you about that.” 

(Im a CNA and i work night shifts. Just for info)

I was again dumbstruck like shocked i was trying to absorb what she just said. I was trying to assess in my mind if what i said was offensive or what. I told her babe i was only asking because i made you food that you said you will eat later dinner. I didnt think it would be offensive im sorry i just was curious. She said “well im an adult and i dont need you commenting on what i eat because it makes me feel weird, if i dont want tofu thats fine. Plus i cant eat left overs because i end up vomiting. Ive been like that ever since a kid. I vomit with left overs” I said i wasnt commenting though i was trying to understand. I asked her “i thought you said youre just particular about flavors now youre saying something else. Youre confusing me.” She said shes not 100% healthwise because of her sleep apnea issue, doctors said she could die and all because of it and sometimes because of that stress she just word vomits. Like she will just say whatever pops up her head and that shes sorry. Its her fault. She will be better she said. Its her fault and not mine shes sorry.

Now i didnt know what to feel or say anymore. I just kept quiet because it felt like the conversation will go nowhere again. So i just let it be again. 

Its like shes says something and then means something else in the end and its making me go crazy. I dint know if im the crazy one. Ive been doing alot of assessing of my self. But i really feel like im being gas lighted or something. 

One time We had a big fight where i did raise my voice in anger. What happened was, we were hanging out playing a game on the day that i had work. I was already getting ready for work and she went to see me before i leave. She said i could just stay home and call out. I said “no im sorryy i really have to work. I dont have savings to cover my upcoming bills. I need this pick up shift for car maintenance “ She then suddenly said “well you dont have to talk shit about me like that” i was once again dumbstruck. Like what did i say now that offended her. I asked her what did she mean. She said “just because im the one with the savings in this relationship and you dont doesnt mean you get to talk shit about me like that, i thought i was being nice to you buying you food and all” i said “hold on babe what are you talking about. Im not talking shit to you nor will i ever do” she was implying that what i said was talking shit to her that here in the US its offensive to talk about someone like that. But in my head i wasnt even talking about her. I never meant anything like that. She was accusing me of talking shit to her and she wont even let me defend myself and thats when i raised my voice and she started saying “do you see how im talking to you im calm im not raising my voice you dont need to act like that whats wrong with you are you okay?” She was asking me like i was going crazy. I ended up crying and just kept my mouth shut. 

I felt helpless again. I ended up not able to go to work. We stood there in silence for like probably 15 minutes until she spoke and said she didnt like the way i reacted. She was very hurt she said. She said “ i see that you dont like being accused of something you think you didnt do and it might be something to do with your childhood how you were raised. You can vent on me if you want i dont mind i can be your punching bag for all that trauma but i dont think im qualified.” She was implying that i needed to go seek mental help. That made me upset but i didnt show it and just kept quiet. I said i assure you, you wont see that side of me ever again. She then proceeded to apologize and said its her fault and shes sorry that she will be more understanding. Its her fault its her fault. 

I just keep quiet and So ever since then i dont really share any of my emotions to her. I like to just keep my mouth shut. And i felt like my feelings for her were fading. I felt drained. Like at work is already stressful then home gets stressful too. Im sorry i dont know what im trying to get here in this thread anymore. I think i just needed a place to vent out my emotions. Like i am crying as i am typing this. Im sorry. 

I really have been doing alot of thinking alot of self assessments if i really am in the wrong or are we just really culturally incompatible. Like she apologizes alot every after argument saying its her fault its her fault. Shes not 100% health wise and shes dragging me down with her.  

It was one time where i really wanted to clean the bed room. Our set up is like she has her own space and i have mine in that room. Like we have our own desks. My side is always neat and tidy. And hers is super messy trash is everywhere. Bubblegum wrappers and used tissues on the floor. Used straws or days old coffee mugs everywhere. Like i understand shes not 100% i wanted to help her by cleaning her side. But she gets mad at me and screams to not touch her stuff. She said shes anal about people touching her stuff. I said i just want to help clean im not touching anything. She said shes sorry its understands that im just trying to do a good thing but she doesnt like people touching her stuff. And im just there again dumbstruck and quiet. I left the room and i told her okay ill let you be ill do laundry instead. When i left the room, she then screams at the top of her lungs and i rushed back in asked her what was wrong. She said she doesnt have the energy to clean any of her stuff. I told her that i didnt tell her to clean her stuff, i wanted to to do it. Shes said no because shes an adult and she should be able to clean up after her self and me helping her clean just hurts her because it makes her feel small. She said Shes not 100% health wise. Shes very stressed out with alot of things about her health. Shes just trying to keep up with her sleep apnea issues. And she said that she can see that its fucking me up too. Like shes emotionally draining me and its all her fault and that shes sorry. Its all her fault she said.  

That moment i dont know what to say or feel i just feel shocked still with everything shes saying. Like i dont know what to say. I just said i think we need space so i will go and do laundry. Ill go to the laundromat and wash all the beddings. She said no because shes not comfortable with her things being washed at the laundromat because of a trauma thing that happened before. She doesnt like it. I said “okay i wont wash them then ill just go out and have fresh air like we need to breathe for a second. “She said “ i dont want you to go i just want a hug. Thats all i want im very stressed im sorry im alot but it hurts me when you try to help me im an adult i just want to be back to normal being able to clean up after my self. “

I was still emotionally full like i feel like i was gonna burst. But i didnt like to share my emotions anymore to her. Like i feel like i cant because she has too much stress already. So i just sat there and hugged her while i was emotionally about to burst my head was in hyperdrive mode. Like i dont know anymore i dont know what to feel anymore. I think im drained. Maybe we are just not compatible i dont know. 

I dont know anymore. I think im going crazy. 

I know shes a nice person when everything is happy. Like happy days. But when it comes to arguments or down days she doesnt know how to handle conflict as she goes into defensive mode and will weaponize things about me. Like if i bring something up to her attention she will be like well you did this and did that you dont hear me complaining about blah blah blah. Or she will say something at first then mean something else in the end. Or she will go into this its my fault its my fault its my fault its because im not 100% okay health wise.. like i dont know what to say to that. I really dont know

She did tell me that in her head i was on a pedestal and her goal is to make me happy everyday. I told her i dont think thats right. You should make you happy. Its not your responsibility to make your partner happy. Thats wrong. 

Right now i really feel drained. I do really feel my feelings have fade slowly. But im not one to initiate break ups unless ive been cheated on. I dont even know how to start the conversation.. i feel like i cant leave her because she needs someone now because shes not okay.. but i feel like thats wrong too. Hays i dunno. I think i do need help. 

Im sorry that this story got all messed up and too long. Thank you for reading. Im sorry again. ",2,1745735656.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

1k8xg3v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8xg3v,Zani is fine,"Ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you Zani, Rinascita’s beacon of resilience, is not just respected in the Montelli household. She’s entrusted with responsibilities befitting her strength and judgment. To suggest she’s ‘just a guard dog’ ignores her autonomy. Do you truly believe someone of her caliber would tolerate being undervalued? If can't even fathom the fact that she can think for herself, how much do you even value her? Her choice of energy drinks? A pragmatic one for a woman who prioritizes efficiency. The Montellis don’t micromanage her habits because they respect her competence. Zani’s role is about action, not perks. She’s where she wants to be: at the heart of the fight, not waiting for coffee to brew. And above all, she's already built up tolerance to espresso, so nothing that Sebastian of the Fisalias can do about it anyway.

Also while on the topic of energy drink. Call them ‘sugary poison’ all you want, but hard work demands fuel. As she puts it: ""I need something sweet to balance out the bitter of hard work"". To dismiss her choice as mere recklessness is to ignore the reality of her role. The Montellis don’t coddle her with the likes of massage chairs because they know what she truly needs: agency, trust, and the tools to get the job done. Plus, she'd rather a human do the massage (something some of us did behind the scene but of course the Fisalias would want to know what we do in our private time). And she *already* has her own gym. Something the Fisalias wouldn't know yet again.

And let’s not pretend the Fisalias’ concern is genuine. Talks about some scary ""sugary poison"" if they cared half as much about ‘health’ as they do about appearances, they wouldn’t need Zani on standby to clean up their messes, where *literal poisons* involve...

The Fisalias' ""employee perks"" as I'd like to imagine they call it; afternoon tea breaks with the Laureate  and the Matriarch herself, sports events, picnic trips, sightseeing and so much more. They all sounds great, almost too good to be true right. That's because they are. Next you gonna tell me they also hand out some participation ribbons for surviving their ""best employee"" program. Or should I say propaganda.   
  
It's all nothing but some propaganda to hide their true agenda. The tea breaks? Tea is poison. Picnic trips? All the foods are poison. All their trips, sightseeing, and sometimes vacation serve only 2 purpose. 1. Collect more herbs and plants for their twisted passion towards poison. 2. Looking good in the public eye and so they can say they do all this so more people would want to join their family. I don't know about the sports events though, if they're genuine about that good for them but you see my point.

They only need Zani because their propaganda almost has no effect anymore, and more of their employee/member is tired of the life of the Fisalia so they're getting desperate and in need of a superstar, a fan favorite to join them.

Even if you don't believe me, even if you think my take is bias, I at least wear my Montelli badge with honor. And Zani doesn’t need your pity. She chose the Montellis because she values purpose over pageantry. While Fisalias’ maids gossip about kiss marks and mini drakes, she’s busy ensuring Rinascita doesn’t collapse under the weight of their performative benevolence.

Vacation? Underpaid? Nonsense... She has the highest salary on the field, and she's free to ask for Vacation whenever she sees fit with how many work she has put. There's no need to ""free"" her as if she's a slave or prisoner here. Maybe ask your *""*best employees*""* in the Fisalia how free they feel polishing silverware for sightseeing privileges.",11,1745735199.0,WuwaUnfiltered,7,1.0,False

I hate coffee, but I love these and would like to get some while there. Cold brew us new for me, but similar to the frappé and iced capp.
If you know what I'm talking about and/or have had these, please let me know! I'm staying in a place right across from the marine like a block or two from the main square, where the big arches are. I think there called arches or windows to the sea?

The attention-grabbing toilets, which include a pair of skis printed on the floor, are designed to provide target customers an extra thrill as they take care of their personal ablutions. This Japanese toilet wraps the visitor in a 360 view of a steep ski jump slope with the snowy piste and the mountain range at the horizon on its walls. The visitor can strap in to a pair of skis on the floor to get the real feel of a skier prepared for the big jump.

Georgia Max Coffee chose to redesign the toilets of a number of key ski resorts in Japan. The cubicles were fully wrapped on all sides, so that the person caught short would have a ski jumper’s view when they were sitting on the loo. The person could look down at their skis (simply printed on the floor of the cubicle) and see the steep ski jump slope ahead of them. The toilet paper holder carried the only brand messaging in the cubicle, reading: “Seriously kick-ass intensely sweet for the real coffee super zinging unstoppable Max! Taste-explosion!”

1k8xf5d,https://i.redd.it/jkd8evhpmbxe1.jpeg,Phillips 5500 - ground coffee and aquafilter questions?,"Hi,

I’ve got a Phillips 5500, which I am very happy with. 

I just have a couple of questions. 

1. I tried to use the ground coffee compartment for a decaf the a couple of nights ago. I put a heaped scoop into the chute, selected the correct “scoop” setting and made a coffee. What came out was basically hot water. Am I missing something? Is there supposed to be an insert in the compartment? I’ve attached a picture of what it looks like in the compartment.

 2. Do I need an aquafilter? The water hardness test in my area showed 4 x green on the test strip, so very soft water here. If I do need one, are the 3rd party ones on Amazon as good as the official ones - any recommendations here?

Thanks

1k8xeeo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8xeeo,Meghan and Jack,"
I usually ignore their stuff because I find them cringey and annoying. But meghans last video popped up on my fyp where she was like “if I want to cuss Jack out or shove him around as a joke, it’s fine!!” And all around really aggressive “how dare you comment on our relationship!”

The context from what I’ve gathered is they posted a video where she was cussing at him and yelling at him for getting coffee without her. The video on her personal page was in response to people saying she was being abusive. I also know they posted a video a while back where Jack said “I can’t be near Meghan when she gets hurt because she starts hitting things” and then showed that she had kicked a hole a wall after she stubbed her toe. And just generally scrolling, she doesn’t clean up after herself, has anger issues, etc. (screenshots of referenced videos above from @meghanlane and @meghanandjack) 

I don’t know much about them other than my brief scroll just now and the times they’ve come up on my FYP. But, her last video truly rubbed me the wrong way and I do think it needed to be discussed. In my opinion, she is really normalizing aggression towards your partner as a funny lil joke. The point of her video was she doesn’t want people commenting on her relationship, and I agree that it’s her and jacks business. BUT they shouldn’t be posting videos where she is outwardly being abusive and aggressive towards him. If the roles were reversed and Jack said “if i cuss Meghan out or shove her around as a joke, it’s fine because it works for us” it would be a more clear how off putting this is ",2,1745735007.0,tiktokgossip,1,1.0,False
1k8xedt,https://i.redd.it/g4e3egggmbxe1.jpeg,In-house vs freelance motion designer: What’s better long term?,"
“Should I settle down with a company? Or keep it casual with freelancing, no strings attached?”
Yeah. Welcome to the love life of a motion designer.

Today, we're diving into the heavyweight showdown: In-House vs Freelance.
Grab your popcorn (or your Wacom pen) — it’s about to get animated.


---

Round 1: The Stability Smackdown

In-House Life:
You get the paycheck. The benefits. The meetings that could have been emails.
It's like a cozy marriage — reliable, but sometimes you find yourself staring out the window wondering if there’s more to life than corporate fonts and brand guidelines.

Freelance Life:
You’re your own boss! You work from coffee shops, beaches, or the couch you haven't left since Tuesday.
But then… oh no… your ""payment is pending for 60 days because finance is on vacation.""
Freelancing is like dating someone exciting — but they might not text you back for two months.


---

Round 2: Creative Freedom Cage Match

In-House:
Want to animate that logo in a wild, glitchy 4D explosion?
Nope.
Brand guidelines say: ""Just a tasteful fade-in, please.""
Your creativity might have to wear a tie to work.

Freelance:
You can create sci-fi unicorns flying over cyberpunk cities if you want — as long as that’s what the client ordered.
One day it's a cereal commercial, the next it's a crypto explainer video narrated by a talking pickle.
Freedom? Yes. Logic? Questionable.


---

Round 3: Long-Term Lifestyle — aka ""Where's My Sanity?""

In-House:
You know where your next project, paycheck, and panic attack are coming from.
Retirement plans? Health insurance? 401(k)? You’re playing the long game.
Just… try not to think about doing the same internal product launch videos for the next 17 years.

Freelance:
You might end up rich... or recreating your portfolio from scratch at 2 a.m.
You have ultimate control — but you’re also the entire accounting, marketing, HR, and tech support department.
Vacation days? Yeah, they exist. They're called ""Unpaid Time Off.""


---

So... What’s Actually Better Long-Term?

Truth bomb:
It’s not about which is better. It’s about *which fits YOU better.

Want stability, teamwork, and an excuse to complain about office coffee? Go In-House.

Want freedom, chaos, and the thrill of possibly animating a cat food commercial at 4 a.m.? Go Freelance.


Or… do both.
The world isn’t black and white — it's full color at 60fps.


---

Final Thoughts: Career Choices Are Like Keyframes

Set the right ones early... and you'll enjoy a much smoother animation.

Whether you’re freelancing on your own terms or thriving in-house, just remember:
Your career is a motion design masterpiece. Don’t forget to make it fun to watch.
