1hobdpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1hobdpt/a_once_in_a_lifetime_company/,!!! A ONCE IN A LIFE-TIME COMPANY !!!,"There are moments in history when the universe gifts humanity with something so groundbreaking, so paradigm-shifting, that you‚Äôd have to be blind, deaf, and brain-dead not to see it. Tesla is that moment. A once-in-a-lifetime company, led by a generational genius, playing 4D chess while Wall Street is still stuck in kindergarten trying to color inside the lines.

Right now, **TSLA is** ***criminally*** **undervalued**. Yes, I said it. If Wall Street actually understood what they were looking at, this stock would already be trading at $2,500 a share‚Äîminimum. Tesla is worth more than Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia COMBINED. Let that sink in. While the dinosaurs on Wall Street are busy crunching their outdated spreadsheets, Tesla is reshaping transportation, energy, AI, and robotics all at once.

Short sellers? üòÇ Don‚Äôt even get me started. These clowns are basically standing in front of a freight train wearing blindfolds and earmuffs, screaming, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs overvalued!‚Äù Newsflash: it‚Äôs not overvalued. It‚Äôs UNDER-realized. You don‚Äôt short the future, my friends‚Äîyou get run over by it.

Every TSLA share you buy today is a ticket to financial nirvana. While the suits on Wall Street argue over P/E ratios, I‚Äôm here Zen-level calm, sipping my coffee, knowing I‚Äôm holding the golden ticket. The opportunity is STILL here because Wall Street is asleep at the wheel.

But hey, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD. Just don‚Äôt come crying to me in 2030 when TSLA hits $15,000 a share and you‚Äôre stuck chasing after some dividend stock paying 2% a year. üöÄ

**TL;DR:** Tesla isn‚Äôt just a company; it‚Äôs a revolution. Wall Street doesn‚Äôt get it (yet), and that‚Äôs YOUR opportunity. Short sellers? LOL. Get in or get left behind. Not financial advice.",1,1735409269.0,TSLA,0,0.67,False

Here‚Äôs a rundown of my daily carry:

* **16"" laptop + charger**
* **0.5L tech pouch**
* **1L med pouch**
* **1 book**
* **Notebook + pens**
* **Over-ear headphones (in travel case)**
* **A few daily medications + vitamins**
* **1L water bottle** (external holder preferred)

* Fit a **medium-sized packing cube** for overnight travel
* Easily accommodate a **mouse + Bluetooth keyboard**
* Have a **quick-access pocket** for my daily medications and phone charger

I‚Äôm not a fan of overly **techy** or **tactical-looking** bags (except for the GR2), so aesthetics matter as well.

I've been curious about trying to get really tasty (sweet / fruity? Not sure of the tasting nomenclature) shots. I've had a few occasionally from good coffee shops, and they're streets ahead of what I'm making myself or am otherwise able to get. I've sort of wondered whether this is a conical burr vs flat burr thing, as I've never been able to find beans that compared, so I've been looking at getting an upgrade to the inbuilt grinder of the Sage.

Currently, I've got a Sage/Barista Pro, which my partner bought for the two of us. We're both a fan of the ease of use and don't have a great deal of negative stuff to say about the kit. Whilst I'm after trying to improve my espresso ritual, I think I'll still occasionally fall back on the convenience of a full hopper quick espresso from a cold start that the Sage offers.

I've just about managed to narrow things down to the Mazzer Philos or the DF64. I understand there's a big price difference between the two. The question I have is am I likely to notice the improvement that the Philos would add over the DF64, or would I be better served by getting the DF64 and upgrading the basket in the Sage as getting some other accessories?

1hoaws0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hoaws0/confessions_of_an_aiden_convert/,Confessions of an Aiden Convert,"I‚Äôm a longtime manual brewer. Aeropress got me off Keurig coffee, and I‚Äôve used a Clever, Kalita Wave, and recently Hario Switch as daily drivers since then with other experiments along the way. I‚Äôve been working from home for more than 10 years, and the ritual of making my morning cup is the thing that delineates home from work for me mentally. 

But lately, my cups haven‚Äôt been good. My kids are 10 and 14, and mornings surprisingly take more coordination at those ages to make sure they‚Äôve eaten something, lunches are packed, and all the gear they need for school and extracurricular stuff is in backpacks. By the time they‚Äôre out the door, I‚Äôm usually in a rush to get to work, and I end up multitasking while brewing. Ritual is out the window ‚Äì I‚Äôm just trying to get a dose of caffeine that tastes halfway decent out of my handcrafted water, argon-stored beans, and SSP-equipped Ode. Most of the time, I‚Äôm not. 

Enter Aiden. 

**Build**

Yeah it‚Äôs plasticky and parts of it feel a little cheap, but it looks dead sexy on my coffee counter next to my Stagg and Ode. There‚Äôs also some real quality touches: the way the brew basket door opens smoothly on a multi-pivot hinge to sit perfectly flush with the top of the machine, the way the brew basket satisfyingly snaps perfectly into place, the fact that the single-serve basket has an outlet valve it doesn‚Äôt technically need just so it doesn‚Äôt drip on the way to the trash. 

In short, it feels like Fellow made the right compromises to make the parts of the machine you touch on a regular basis quite nice while saving on material cost elsewhere to keep Aiden ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù.

**Workflow**

If you‚Äôre used to a manual brew routine, workflow is mostly the same. Pick a recipe, tell Aiden how much coffee you want to brew, weigh and grind the amount of beans prescribed on the screen (calculated from recipe ratio), place and rinse your filter, and you‚Äôre off to the races. 

It‚Äôs a little weird starting from how much coffee you want to produce (300ml) rather than how much beans you want to use (18g), but it didn‚Äôt take long to get used to that. Also, as an American used to thinking of coffee weights in grams, liquid volumes in milliliters, and water temperatures in Fahrenheit, it‚Äôs a little strange to have a binary choice of g/ml/¬∞C or oz/oz/¬∞F, but I‚Äôm getting used to thinking about water temps in ¬∞C pretty quickly too.

Cleanup‚Äôs a breeze. Just pop the filter basket out, dump the filter, and give it a quick rinse. I also rinse out the water reservoir daily as well, but that‚Äôs only because the Epsom salt/baking soda concentrate I use to doctor my water leaves gnarly deposits if it dries on anything.

**The Coffee**

I can‚Äôt speak to Aiden‚Äôs batch brew capabilities because I haven‚Äôt used them yet. My wife‚Äôs an espresso gal and we bought her a superautomatic a while back for her daily fix, so I‚Äôm the only filter drinker around here. 

Its single-cup capabilities quite frankly blow me away. I was skeptical of some of the glowing reviews I‚Äôve read but figured it would at least be more consistent than me. It far exceeds that bar.  The coffee is juicy, sweet, delicious, and balanced. The fruity notes I love so much in natural process beans come right through.

On my best day, with 100% concentration and with a recipe I‚Äôve dialed in for a particular bean, I can probably still brew a better cup, but not by much. On a normal day, with all the distractions of getting kids out the door, Aiden‚Äôs gonna beat me 99 times out of 100. The one trick I wish it had in its arsenal is being able to switch from percolation to immersion halfway through a brew (a la the Hario Switch) to take some of the harshness and body out of certain beans so the flavors can shine through a little more, but I guess it‚Äôs nice to be able to do something a robot can‚Äôt.

The stock light roast recipe is _fine_, but the ever-growing [library of curated recipes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1mi-YS6JYfbX3wN1kZd6iu_q6mFlWM4Ah6N3Ox8eqRCA/htmlview#gid=0) from Fellow Drops gives a much better starting point for most beans. Just find something similar to what you‚Äôre brewing, give that recipe a go, and tweak from there. It‚Äôs configurable enough to let you leverage the knowledge you already have about how you like to brew particular beans, and the consistency makes it much easier to dial in because human variability isn‚Äôt a factor.

My manual brew equipment isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and I‚Äôll still break it out on days when I‚Äôve got the time to luxuriate in the ritual. But on a normal day, the Aiden will handily replace my routine with better coffee. I still get a bit of ritual in weighing and grinding beans, but I can‚Äôt screw things up by missing timings or overpouring. For me, Aiden is turning out to be a really nice balance for my current phase of life.

1hoarm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1hoarm2/oceania_nautica_disappointing_cruise/,Oceania Nautica - disappointing cruise,"Currently taking a Panama Canal cruise on Nautical.  We are in our 50‚Äôs, and have both cruised over 40 times on many different lines including Royal. Princess, Celebrity, Silversea, Seabourn, and Carnival.  Nowadays, we book a suite. On this ship we got an entry level ‚ÄúPenthouse‚Äù which is basically a wider version of the standard balcony cabin with butler service.  It‚Äôs a nice room, and while the ship is old, it is elegant.  We previously sailed on Oceania in an Owners suite on the Riviera in 2016.  Amazing room, but same disappointments as we have on this voyage.  Fool me twice‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt be back.

Our gripes are:
- very old cruisers. Most in late 70‚Äôs, some approaching 100 years.  We‚Äôve met a few nice folks, but most are grumpy and keep to themselves
- we like the trivia, game shows, and other hosted interactive entertainment on cruises.  Oceania has one daily trivia at 4:30pm.  That‚Äôs basically it.  There are sewing circles and (unbelievably) tic-tac-toe games on the schedule.  But mostly the sea days are BORING.
- the food is hit or miss, mostly miss.  They claim to have the best cuisine on ‚Äúthe high seas‚Äù.  Nonsense.  The steak in Polo grill is tough, cheap cut, flavorless with no marbling, under seasoned, and not well seared, then served on a cold plate.  Dennys and Sizzler put this place to shame.  All the fish dishes, even the crab cakes, tasted and smelled of ‚Äúold fish‚Äù - could not eat them.  The promising Avocado toast with poached eggs was a disaster because the toast was so stale and rock hard you couldn‚Äôt cut it with a steak knife. I could go on and on.  There have been some pleasant surprises, but far too many train wrecks hit the table.
- the music is for a different target audience.  I know some folks like concert violin and opera, but not me.
- both hot tubs have been out of service, I hope they fix them‚Ä¶
- the dress code is a PITA.  I had slacks and a dressy Ralph Lauren t-shirt on, tucked in with a leather belt.  They sent me away to go put on a collared shirt.  Can‚Äôt say they didn‚Äôt warn me, so I had packed a few collared shirts. But it isn‚Äôt what I like to wear.  No other cruise line I have sailed has been this strict.  They usually just want you to look ‚Äúnice‚Äù.
- they bait and switched 2 ports.  Key West was removed from the schedule right after we booked, and replaced with private island.  But more upsetting was the promise that we would visit Nicaraguan, which was cancelled a few days before sailing.  The zinger is that Nicaraguan has been closed to cruise ships since Covid.  Those two ports were the half of the reason we took this sailing instead of just flying home from Miami,
- many of the staff are short tempered and rude.  Not all, but many.  I know this is hard work, and miserable working conditions.  But being nice to passengers is part of the job.  An example‚Ä¶ after ordering a drink, I asked the coffee shop attendant who was working the station solo if I could have a paper towel to wipe down the table where my wife has sat down (he was very busy).  I asked nicely, but he snapped at me, told me to be patient.  I wasn‚Äôt being impatient!  After he spent a few minutes doing other things, he eventually gave me the towel.  

In short, the onboard activities are sparse, people are very old, food is mediocre, hot tubs are broken, ports are being cancelled, and the staff is grumpy.  I wish this cruise was over.",2,1735407642.0,Cruise,2,0.63,False

Katniss remarks the arenas are outdoor and notes no exception (obviously this predates TBOSAS so the Capitol arena would be an exception) so we can assume all the arenas are like the ones we see and hear of, entirely outdoor with the biome being the main aspect of it. Indoor arenas or ones with indoor elements are a very popular discussion piece within the fandom that I think we've largely forgotten that Katniss says they are outdoor and normally I would just brush it up to fanon vs canon and not pay it any mine, but there are a few nagging questions in my brain on this topic.

Is it realistic is it that they would only do outdoor arenas? There would possibly be a lot of similar ones with some tweaks, but at the end of the day the Capitol have probably seen a dozen types of forest before they even got to the 74th and 75th. It seems somewhat peculiar to me that they would limit it to biome-type arenas when there are perfectly horrid indoor or hybrid arenas the Gamemakers could pick. I will admit, from a practicality point I understand why they do outdoor arenas with an open top, but it is interesting that in the books we hear no comment on them attempting anything else.

In the movie we see Katniss watching the games which is an urban setting and normally I would dismiss this as movie canon and not book canon (there are a lot of those lol) but something that makes me rethink this is the fact that in the OG script for the Hunger Games the 73rd arena is set in Aspen and was set to have old coffee shops, ski rental shops and yohghurt shops so this arena has indoor areas which were accessible to the tributes. The interesting part is Suzanne Collins was a screenwriter on both of these scripts and likely had input on the decisions to represent arenas with indoor areas. 

Obviously this isn't proof and the OG script is a whole mess of things that wouldn't be accepted as canon in other discussions and the final script has many contradictions to the books, but it is something I think is worth noting.

So yeah, just wanted some opinions. Do you think indoor or mixed indoor-outdoor arenas are solely fanon or do you accept them as canon in some capacity? ",2,1735407519.0,Hungergames,6,0.75,False

The storm had come earlier than expected and the pitter patter of rain on the roof made the tiny house seem colder. Michael and Daniel were the first to wake up to light the wood stove in the living room. Afterward Michael got to work on making cinnamon rolls for breakfast while Daniel focused on bringing in wood for the fire. 

Unlike most traditional families, there was no plastic or even a real Christmas tree somewhere in the living room. When Michael was three their family was stretched thin. Daniel was inbetween jobs and they relied on Cassandra waiting tables. At some point during that year, a sugar pine had been planted in the front yard, more than likely the seed had lodged itself in Daniel's boot from work and found itself a perfect place to grow. 

Through the years the tree had become a part of the family. It bore a yellow ribbon Cassandra tied around it when Michael was deployed. It sheltered Daniel when he was at a loss for what to do. It provided Michael wih a view down the Mad River to the Pacific and beyond. 

""Damn things nearly 80 feet tall."" Michael said handing a cup of coffee to his father. 

Daniel.took the mug and let the warmth flow into his hands. 

""I remember all the times we used to decorate it. Almost killed myself when you were 17 trying.to get that star on top."" 

""Remember the long ass string of popcorn when I was 11?"" 

""I remember the rain that Christmas,"" Daniel replied with a laugh,  ""your mother was so pissed."" 

""Good times."" Michael said before taking a drink. 

""Your mother will be out of bed soon, is Gettret up yet?"" 

""If you think I can sleep when Mike's baking you don't know your own son."" Came a voice from the living room. 

""Guess that answers that question."" 

/////

After the rolls were finished baking, Michael coated them heavily with a raspberry butter cream frosting and made sure everyone's coffee was full. Presents were passed around and the tradition of unceremoniously ripping pretty colored paper to shreds began. The presents beneath were all thoughtful, things that were necessities more than anything, but cherished none the less. After the last shred of paper had been cleared Michael picked up the plates and coffee cups, refilling them for the second time as Gettret served. 

""Oh honey I'm stuffed."" Cassandra replied when she saw the new roll. 

""Please miss.."" 

""Just mom, or Cassy. You're a part of the family now like it or not."" 


""That's why the cinnamon rolls actually."" Gettret replied shyly. 

""What do you mean, dear?"" 

Michael exited the kitchen with his own plate and mug. ""It's part of our last gift to you for Christmas."" 

""I don't get it, Mike."" Daniel said, taking the offered plate. 

""Gettret and I..."" 

""Mike's horrible at these things,"" Gettret laughed, ""He is hinting at it with the frosting."" 

Daniel and Cassandra looked at their plates again in confusion.

""Dad asked yesterday if we could have a baby."" Michael said. ""That was the reason Gettret went home last week."" 

Confusion was replaced with shock as both of Michael's parents picked up the hint.

1hoalpp,https://i.redd.it/h88rclijkm9e1.jpeg,[Dragon Age: The Veilguard] #151 Probably the most disappointed I‚Äôve ever been in a video game,"Lots to talk about with this one. I had a lot of issues with the narrative in this game, both with story and characters. 

First issue is when the story starts. I feel like we start about 1/3 into the actual story where disrupt Solas‚Äôs ritual, just feels we‚Äôre rushing into it and it would‚Äôve been better in my eyes if we had start with more of a build up

I really don‚Äôt like how much of lore uncovered in this game just boils down to ‚ÄúThe Elves did it‚Äù just makes the world less interesting for me .
Some lore inconsistencies that bother me. We hear so much about Tevinter being the place where magic rules and slave runs high, yet we don‚Äôt get a clear indication of either of those. At the end of the Trespasser DLC, a cut of Elves flock away to join Solas, yet there‚Äôs nothing of them in this game

I also had much issues with the villains, they‚Äôre kinda just a slightly better version of Corypheus(he really sucks as a character). They‚Äôre just not very compelling, interesting, or threatening really. I would‚Äôve preferred if we just had Solas as the main villain.

The cast of companions were rough this time around. 

Neve is now the worst companion in the franchise in my eyes, she‚Äôs Mass Effect Jacob Taylor levels of boring and I don‚Äôt what the hell was going on with her voice actress, but she sounded like a fucking robot the whole game.

Taash is not very good. I feel like I would‚Äôve liked them better if BioWare didn‚Äôt botch and fuck around with the message of their personal quest and gave them a better personality than that of a 16 year old moody teenager.

Lucanis is very one note. His only noteworthy traits is his love for coffee and how Spite is an inconvenience every once in a while. Plus the e whole Spite storyline was just so underwhelming.

Harding was alright, she‚Äôs kinda the representative of just OK.

Davin is pretty good, I enjoyed him Assan. And his storyline of deciding the fate of the Griffons was solid

Bellara is pretty good as well. She was sort of another version of Merrill but amped up to 11, gets a little annoying at times but I can deal with that

Emmrich is the one true star of Veilguard, loved him and Manfred is my fucking boy. He was the only storyline I was fully invested in.

With other characters, Varric I saw the twist from about 20 miles away. Solas was another diamond in the rough for this game, characters returning from past games don‚Äôt really have any emotional impact for me, it‚Äôs just kinda ‚ÄúOh, they‚Äôre here.‚Äù

And then there‚Äôs Rook, such a nothing character. It‚Äôs possible to have a protagonist in an RPG with a set up backstory, but BioWare botched it here. Rook is not even really a character, they just move the plot forward. And it doesn‚Äôt help with the dialogue wheel where every option in dialogue says pretty much the same thing in a slightly different tone(They Fallout 4‚Äôd it). Seriously BioWare needs to ditch the dialogue wheel.

Overall the game was underwhelming, disappointing, and just not very good. 3/10",4,1735407183.0,Trophies,1,0.75,False

Today I engaged in a bit of escapism; I rank escapism high on the list of self care.

I felt like being out of the house, but I did not feel like leaving the house. So rather than just be stuck and feeling antsy, I made my coffee, and with the help of YouTube, I turned my phone on to my favorite jazz and put a P.O.V riding the Pacific Coast Highway on the TV.

For the next 30 minutes I felt like I was out riding the Pacific Coast Highway with my jazz playing and coffee in my hand. I really enjoyed watching the scenery and the sunset. After I allowed myself to come back to reality, I decided to see if there is any real benefit in escapism. This is what I found.

Escapism is to the tendency to seek distraction and relief from everyday life, often through activities or entertainment that provide a temporary diversion.

This can include activities like reading books, watching movies or TV shows, playing video games, daydreaming, or even traveling. Essentially, escapism allows you to step away from your routine, for a little while.

It's a natural coping mechanism that, when used in moderation, can help reduce stress and improve mental well-being. However, it's important to ensure it doesn't become a way to consistently avoid dealing with real-life challenges and responsibilities.

Escapism can have several health benefits when practiced in moderation. Here is how it can help.

1. **Stress Reduction**: escapist activities, such as reading, watching movies, or playing video games, can provide a temporary reprieve from daily stressors, allowing the mind and body to relax and recuperate.
2. **Enhanced Creativity**: Immersing oneself in different worlds or experiences can stimulate creativity, offering new perspectives and ideas that can be applied to problem-solving and personal growth.
3. **Improved Mood**:a: reading a captivating book or watching an uplifting film can boost mood and provide emotional relief, helping to combat feelings of sadness or anxiety.
4. **Emotional Regulation**: Escapism can help people manage their emotions by providing a safe outlet to express and explore feelings in a controlled environment. This can contribute to improved emotional resilience and self-awareness.
5. **Relaxation**: Taking a mental break from real-life pressures and immersing in an alternative reality can reduce anxiety and enhance relaxation.

It's important to strike a balance and not use escapism as a way to consistently avoid facing real-life issues. When used appropriately, escapism can be a valuable tool for maintaining mental well-being and fostering resilience in the face of everyday pressures1.

I was born January first. It's a crappy birthday since everyone is partied out from Christmas and New Year's Eve so nobody ever wants to hang out with me, even just to go out for dinner or even coffee. It becomes an afterthought and I'll be lucky to get a Happy Birthday from anyone beyond my immediate family and in-laws.  
  
It doesn't help that in my town most places are closed New Year's Day and there's very little to do on the day, which takes away the fun of having a birthday on a national holiday. Granted I've never had school or work on the day which was nice, so it wasn't all bad.

My husband (33M) has seen the hatred for my birthday brewing as the years have gone by and has tried his best to make the day nice for me, but his plans often fall flat because of things outside of his control.

For context my husband uses an iPhone and Macbook which are synced together, so all his texts show up on the Macbook. I read his family group chat since they're all iPhone users and I'm on Android and not part of it. I like to send pictures and updates of our children via his laptop so it's not uncommon for me to see incoming messages pop up. My husband is fully aware of this and it doesn't bother him since he has nothing to hide.   
So when I saw a message from my friend who was my maid of honor at our wedding my curiosity was piqued. I read the exchange and I learned what he was planning for my birthday.  
He's making a memory jar, which is a container filled with written sentiments of friends and family's cherished memories with the person. It's a lovely idea but I think it's not going to pan out since my birthday is in three days and no one has sent him their memories yet. He's messaged the people involved just before Christmas asking if they had them done, but no one has sent him anything yet, most stating they had forgotten, the rest leaving him on read.

I've mentally prepared myself that this idea will fail and it won't be ready in time. It's not because they don't care, but because Christmas is such a busy time of year and they all have jobs, families, and lives of their own that will be prioritized above writing a blurb for my birthday gift.  
While I appreciate that he's trying to show me that I'm not an afterthought and people love me, I wish he would have simply bought the slippers I asked for and a bottle of vodka so I can get wasted after the kids go to bed.",9,1735407041.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,12,1.0,False

I've heard stories from my aunts about how the guy (grandpa) would come over to see my grandma who was still living with my great grandparents, and they said the man did nothing for my dad. That didn't sit well with my great grandfather, and he pulled a shotgun on my grandpa. The guy never came back to the house again and my dad was pretty much raised by his grandparents. Later on, my dad talked to his dad on the phone for the first time and had the chance to meet him back when he was in his late 20s at a coffee shop, but he stood the guy up, which I don't blame him (in fact, my mom (deceased) pretty much pushed my dad into meeting his dad). My dad only knew his name not how he looked. He had no desire to know him at all.

My mom (born in AL and moved to Chicago with her two older sisters when she was a baby), on the other hand, is a different case to me. She never knew who her real dad was. No name or picture. In fact, growing up I always thought my grandmother's husband was my mom's biological dad. I didn't find out until his funeral, when I read the obituary. It's crazy because despite the fact that my mom looks like her mom, she has physical features that her 3 younger half-siblings and stepdad share. I was a kid when I found out.

I just wished I would've known the truth when my grandma was alive so I could've asked her more questions about him. I remember at 18, I asked my mom if she ever wanted to know who her real dad was and she was pretty nonchalant about it. My dad told me that it was my mom's idea for him to meet his dad since his mother still had his dad's number after all those years.

That didn't sit well with my great grandfather, and he pulled a shotgun on my grandpa. The guy never came back to the house again and my dad was pretty much raised by his grandparents.

Water is often referred to as the elixir of life. It plays a vital role in keeping your body and mind functioning properly. You may be surprised to learn just how essential drinking water is for your overall health. Here are ten important reasons why staying hydrated is crucial for a healthier life.

Did you know that drinking water aids in digestion? When you consume food, your body requires water to help break it down. This process allows your body to absorb nutrients efficiently. If you find yourself feeling bloated or constipated, increasing your water intake might just be the solution you need.

### 2. Enhances Physical Performance

Whether you are exercising or simply going about your daily routine, water is key to maintaining energy levels. When you are well-hydrated, your stamina improves, reducing fatigue and cramps. By ensuring you drink enough water before, during, and after exercise, you can optimize your performance.

","This is kind of a vent. My roommate pisses me off, but not enough to make her a ""bad"" roommate. I'm in my late 20's and she's in her early 30's. It's been 3.5 months and I'm kind of regretting my decision. She's fine as a person, we've had chats about our lives and stuff (although she's a yapper so it's 80% her talking).

Some things she does that annoy me:

\* Walking very loudly, I don't understand it. It sounds like she's stomping her feet and I'm afraid if there's people below us that they're suffering.

\* Having late night snacks and then seeing crumbs and wrappers laid out the next morning

\* Also related to snacks, she ate all of my cookies and replaced them, only for her to eat all of those too

\* Putting things that can be recycled in the trash, which takes up more space and makes our trash fill up faster

\* Using laundry pods in our front loader. I don't think our washer does well with pods because whenever she dries whatever she washed, it makes the apartment smell like BO and laundry detergent.

\* Saying that she's ""oblivious"" to some things, and she's right because she has no natural instinct to be proactive or figure things out

Also it bothers me that she doesn't seem at all interested in decorating and furnishing our apartment. It took over a month to get barstools and a couch, almost two months to get a TV, and nearly three months to get a TV stand. It's important for me to have those things to feel like I'm settled, I hated being confined to my room since there wasn't anywhere to sit.

She was insistent on using Facebook marketplace to find furniture to save money, but never took that much initiative outside of sending me a few options for furniture. And then she had a super cheap budget that was not realistic to me. She has her own furniture in a storage unit in her hometown, and she eventually wants to purchase a house, so that's her rationale for not wanting to spend much.

I tried to ask for her input a few times and she didn't seem interested, the most recent time I said I would be buying things for the apartment and if she preferred any colors or patterns. She said she's ""checked out"" because she knows this is temporary and that she has expensive furniture sitting in storage. I (somewhat resentfully) decided to start adding things on my own and paying for them myself (instead of splitting the cost). In the span of a few days, I got two shoe racks for $35 and a coffee table for $50, both from Facebook marketplace. 

I've accepted that I'm going to be the one who cares more and puts more effort into our apartment, and that we probably won't be renewing our lease.",3,1735406384.0,badroommates,7,1.0,False
1hoaaqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1hoaaqb/festive_lonelinessspiralling/,Festive loneliness/spiralling ,"As I've noticed for many people here, the festive season is very very triggering, especially if was raised in a very dysfunctional and  abusive household.

I for the most part usually have somewhat of a grasp of my emotions/symptoms, in comparison to what I've been feeling the last few weeks, but even my self aware ass, and opposite distraction/healthy coping mechs ain't helping at all at the moment.

  I feel like I'm spiralling and constantly splitting multiple times a day (not so much outwardly, I don't even think anyone has even barely noticed maybe except my boyfriend a little bit) with the overwhelming emotions and feelings, my brain and chest legit feels on fire and I'm feeling the overwhelming agony of spiralling back and forth and extreme emotional pain that is becoming very all consuming.

I haven't really seen anyone over the festive season apart from my grandma. 
I haven't spent time nor seen any close or loved ones, nor been invited anywhere to do anything or spend time with anyone, apart from my boyfriend did invite me over on Xmas day, but we're in a fairly new relationship, and I don't want to rush into meeting his parents just yet.
We met in September this year, so that ain't on him that I said no to that, although a big part of me regrets saying no, but I felt I didn't want to rush things and take things slowly, but I do regret saying no üòÆ‚Äçüí® this fucking brain man.

 I also didn't want to leave my gran alone on Xmas day (although she's one of the reasons I'm like how I am, was brought up in a very controlling, toxic, abusive environment) 
   I did live away from her for a while, but moved back in this year due to some reasons I don't want to disclose, but it wasn't really via choice.

 Since I moved back my symptoms this year have been a lot more haywire than they was before although I still had a good grasp on my symptoms/emotions, but these last couple of weeks have been almost unbearable with the emotions and spiralling, I'm even seeing things/hearing things and that's stressing me out more, been days I can't sleep and days I'm sleeping loads, constantly feeling extreme paranoia too.

My dad blocked me for no reason just after my birthday in November also ( without getting too into it, it's been a recurring pattern he's always done, always in and out of life, never wrong and never apologises and always shifts blame onto everyone else around him)     And then tried to get his g.f to force me to contact him and ring two days before Xmas, which I refused to do this time (I usually would contact first, even when I'm not in the wrong, because I desperately used to want a relationship with him, but now I get extreme anxiety even thinking about that, so decided it's about time to go no contact with him) but his g.f messaging my gran to try and force me to contact him, really triggered me, I'm sick of offering olive branches to him, I've done it all my life.
  
None of my other family really bothered with me or invited me anywhere over any of the days, and seeing all the happy pictures etc on socials was another trigger, (although at the same time I actually feel happy for them because they're enjoying their selves and are happy, fucking paradoxical right? üòÆ‚Äçüí®)

I asked a few friends if they would all like to meet up today on my day off, or tomorrow and do something nice like go to the cinema or food or coffee, and even offered to treat them and pay but  they're all busy doing things.
I didn't ask my partner as had the feeling he would be busy and I would get rejected, (which he is busy).

I completely understand everyone has their own lives, and has things they want to do, but it just seems like unless it's something they want to do, or something that benefits them in some way, then they ain't interested.
I've listened to friends vent to me multiple times over the last few weeks over voice notes etc and messages, but now when I need to talk or vent to the same friends, (I usually internalise a lot of what I'm going through/feeling and very very rarely reach out) everyone just seems to be busy, or disengaged this time when I've been honest and said I'm genuinely struggling with my mental health at the moment (friends/family).

 I haven't really openly messaged my partner about it, as it was his birthday also this week and Xmas and didn't want to put a downer on his Xmas week, plus he has had a few things go on, on his side too, so didn't want to impose my struggles onto him, but now I feel like in turn I'm splitting and kinda pushing him away, which I desperately do NOT want to do, but these emotions and symptoms are just too engulfing at the moment.

I dunno I think  I'm just genuinely going mad and spiralling over everything.

I would usually draw, listen to music, go to the gym, watch stuff on YouTube or a movie, and I'm pretty used to isolation and just being in my own company when everyones busy.
I've isolated as well for months at a time in the past and been somewhat okay, but I'm literally lay in bed just procrastinating and feeling like I want to just rip out of my own skin, I can't be bothered doing anything alone rn I just don't find it fun or entertaining.
 I have alcohol and I'm thinking of just downing the bottle so it knocks me out and have the day over and done with and just wake up tomorrow. I plan to have a ""productive"" day and go and get my nose repierced tomorrow, but maybe that's just so I can feel some sort of pain maybe? I do find piercings pretty though and feel brief euphoria for a bit after having one, and I definitely have some masochistic traits,  so maybe it's a mix?

I'm wanting January to get here asap, I feel like I'll bounce back okay, it's weird to have that thought process, but I genuinely feel like some of you fellow pwbpd will completely understand what I mean there.

I'm about 4  years SH free, but the last few days I genuinely feel like I just want to cut.

I somewhat have plans on Nye if everything goes smooth sailing which I am grateful for.

I feel I need to see someone irl, not through texting or socials, I want to connect with friends or partner in real life, not through sparse messages, at the moment.

I am genuinely usually very compromising and very giving, and respect boundaries and others personal space, even at the expense of not having my own needs met, but I'm usually A-Ok with it, but these last two weeks, especially this last week even more so, I feel like I'm going ""mad"", and just want a irl conversation and connection.

I just genuinely feel so so alone and lonely and like I need a hug now man ‚òπÔ∏è   ",5,1735406353.0,BorderlinePDisorder,4,1.0,False

To give a little bit of back ground information, I have been binge eating for about one year, i could only do a maximum of 4 days normally eating before binging, but the cravings were awful, i tried surfing the urge, but it was relentless, I could easily pack away 6000 calories over my normal calories and it was awful.

It came as a surprise because i was drinking coffee long before i was binge eating so i never saw the correlation, I did drink a lot of coffee as well, normally 2 a day.

* Full set of troubleshooter's power armor with medic pump
* Bullet shield, ricochet, junk shield, all heavy gunner perks
* Vampire Crippling Gatling Laser for the EN06 shield
* Aristocrat's Rapid Prime Gatling Plasma for the torso once the shield drops (it doesn't have the new gatling mods but is maxed out as much as I can otherwise) (I've tried Antiarmor, no difference)
* Coffee for crits, when I can use them
* Destroy all four computer cores at the start (I've tried not destroying them, no difference)
* Adelaide's ally buff

I can tank the damage without any issues at all -- the armor and perks keep me alive and the ricochet damages the shield just fine. But when it comes to taking out the torso, after three full cycles I can only get it down to 10-15% health before the room explodes and I'm dead.

I can't think of any way to juice up the damage any more than I am. I've seen people on youtube take the thing down without a gatling plasma, so the lack of new mods isn't the issue -- and I've seen it taken down without any VATS at all, too, while I'm using VATS crits.

# What's Making Iki AI Buzz in 2024?

I've been testing Iki AI extensively and let me tell you - it's not just another bookmark manager. This bad boy has earned its spot as one of AppSumo's¬†[Tools of the Year 2024](https://www.easyviralbiz.com/appsumo), and there's a good reason for that.

Picture having a smart research assistant who never sleeps, doesn't drink your coffee, and actually remembers everything you save. That's Iki AI for you!

# The Good, The Bad, and The Interface

First things first - the interface is cleaner than my desk after my wife visits my home office (which, trust me, is saying something). You get both¬†**dark and light modes**, because we all know how passionate people can be about their preferred viewing experience.

# What's Hot:

* Clean, intuitive interface
* GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration
* Smart content analysis
* Easy-to-use Chrome extension
* Public/private collection options

# What's Not:

* YouTube transcription currently unavailable
* Confusing public/private toggle UI
* Limited collection management options
* Thumbnail issues with some saved content

# Pricing Breakdown: Is It Worth Your Coffee Money?

# Tier 1: Solo Explorer

**Price: $59**

* ‚úÖ 200 Co-pilot queries per month
* ‚úÖ Single user access
* ‚úÖ 5 hours video transcription
* ‚úÖ Basic library features
* ‚úÖ Chrome extension
* ‚úÖ AI-powered search
* ‚ùå No team space

# The Secret Sauce: AI Co-pilot Features

The AI co-pilot is like having a super-smart intern who actually reads everything you save. Here's what it can do:

1. **Web Search**: Ask questions, get instant answers with sources
2. **Library Search**: Query your saved content
3. **Global Search**: Access public knowledge from other users

And yes, you can choose between¬†**GPT-4**, GPT-4 Mini, or¬†**Claude 3.5 Sonnet**¬†as your AI sidekick. Fancy, right?

# Real-World Usage: My Experience

I threw everything I could at Iki AI - blog posts, tweets, and even attempted some YouTube videos (more on that drama later). The tool handled content like a champ, automatically tagging and summarizing everything.

The Chrome extension is smoother than butter on warm toast. One click, and boom - content saved! Though I wish it pulled images better for thumbnails (looking at you, Cal Newport article).

# The YouTube Saga

Here's the tea: YouTube transcription is currently on vacation. It's supposed to be a killer feature, but due to some policy changes, it's temporarily out of service. The team promises it's coming back, but for now, if you're buying this for video transcription, maybe hold onto your wallet.

# [Save.day](http://Save.day) vs [Iki AI](https://www.easyviralbiz.com/appsumo): The Showdown

Both tools are like siblings who went to different colleges. Here's the quick comparison:

|Feature|[Iki AI](https://www.easyviralbiz.com/appsumo)|[Save.day](http://save.day/)|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|Login System|Username/Password|OAuth only|
|Chrome Extension|Basic|Feature-rich|
|Interface|Clean, Modern|Also clean|
|Video Features|Limited (currently)|More robust|
|AI Integration|Multiple models|Basic|

# Tips for Maximum Iki-ness

1. **Start Private**: Despite the confusing UI, make your collections private by default
2. **Batch Save**: Use the Chrome extension for quick saves
3. **Organize Early**: Create collections before you start saving
4. **AI Power**: Don't be shy with the co-pilot - it's your friend

# The Verdict: 7.6/10

Is it perfect? Nope. Is it still pretty awesome? You bet! The current score of 7.6 feels like watching a great movie with temporary audio issues - the potential is clear, but some fixes are needed.

# Who Should Buy?

* **Content creators**¬†needing a smart library
* **Researchers**¬†wanting AI-powered analysis
* **Teams**¬†looking for a shared knowledge base
* **Digital hoarders**¬†(like me) seeking organization

# Who Should Wait?

* Users primarily needing video transcription
* Those requiring advanced Chrome extension features
* Budget users who'll exceed 200 monthly co-pilot queries

1hoa5ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1hoa5ob/advice_on_dressing_for_my_new_unique_proportions/,"Advice on dressing for my new unique proportions? Brands, layers, cuts, tailoring? During my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly‚Äînow stuck with a 67‚Äù gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it‚Äôs the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve seen. ","Over the past 9+ months, I‚Äôve experienced a truly surreal transformation due to an extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy.‚Äù I (M31) have gained 130 pounds‚Äîall in my belly‚Äîduring my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, leaving me with a 67-inch waistline and a silhouette that looks more overdue with quadruplets than any standard body type. While I‚Äôve come to terms with the medical side of this condition, one of the most frustrating aspects of my transformation has been figuring out how to dress myself with any sense of style, comfort, or dignity.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

My body has outgrown nearly every piece of clothing I own, and I‚Äôm at a loss for what to wear. Button-up shirts pull so tight that they gape open, and even the largest sizes I‚Äôve tried seem to ride up over my belly whenever I move. Pants are just as difficult‚Äîthey constantly dig into the underside of my belly or refuse to stay up without a belt, which only emphasizes how far my stomach pushes out. Most of the time, I feel like I‚Äôm one wardrobe malfunction away from total embarrassment, and it‚Äôs only added to the already overwhelming stares and comments I get in public.

I‚Äôm hoping this community can offer some guidance on how to dress for my unique proportions. Are there certain brands or cuts that might better accommodate a large, round belly? Should I prioritize oversized fits, stretchy materials, or specific types of tailoring? I‚Äôd also love tips on colors or layering techniques to downplay the size of my belly and create a more balanced look. Any advice on how to make my wardrobe functional, flattering, and comfortable would be incredibly appreciated.

For context, I‚Äôll include the details of my transformation and condition below. Feel free to AMA if you‚Äôre curious‚Äîthanks so much for your help:

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this, but after what‚Äôs happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I‚Äôm living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children‚Äîtwins!‚Äîand her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what‚Äôs called Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy,‚Äù where men mimic some of their partner‚Äôs pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny‚Äîme complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I‚Äôve gained over 130 pounds, and it‚Äôs all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition‚ÄîCushing‚Äôs syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife‚Äôs pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here‚Äôs the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It‚Äôs perfectly round, heavy, and tight‚Äîso much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I‚Äôve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public‚Äôs stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, ‚ÄúWhen are you due?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you having twins‚Äîor is it triplets?‚Äù Sometimes, people assume I‚Äôm joking when I say I‚Äôm not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling ‚ÄúHey, heifer! How‚Äôd you get so huge, fatass!‚Äù and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, ‚ÄúWhen are the babies due?‚Äù and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, ‚ÄúAre you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you‚Äôre about to pop!‚Äù His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like ‚ÄúDamn, bro, that‚Äôs the most impressive belly I‚Äôve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called ‚Äúthe most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.‚Äù The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife‚Äôs parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn‚Äôt believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it‚Äôs become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife‚Äôs.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife‚Äôs pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She‚Äôs been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I‚Äôm taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty‚Äîthis was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I‚Äôm the one everyone‚Äôs talking about.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don‚Äôt fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I‚Äôve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don‚Äôt last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren‚Äôt any better‚Äîthey‚Äôre so tight under the curve of my gut that I‚Äôve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I‚Äôm required to wear a uniform‚Äîa button-up shirt, no less‚Äîand squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pop, and they often do‚Äîsometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I‚Äôve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I‚Äôm outgrowing something else, to the point where I‚Äôm running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it‚Äôs going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I‚Äôve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I‚Äôve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They‚Äôve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they‚Äôve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like a sideshow. I‚Äôve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I‚Äôve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there‚Äôs a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I‚Äôd wake up nauseous when she did, I‚Äôd have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I‚Äôd have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn‚Äôt just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body‚Äôs hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I‚Äôve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn‚Äôt helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I‚Äôm not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I‚Äôve been experiencing‚Äîlike elevated prolactin and cortisol levels‚Äîhave completely derailed any sense of self-control. It‚Äôs as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I‚Äôve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore‚Ä¶ Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of ‚Äúhyper-storage mode,‚Äù where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it‚Äôs mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it‚Äôs created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It‚Äôs crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult‚Äîand frankly embarrassing‚Äîsymptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it‚Äôs such a large part of the psychological side effects I‚Äôve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I‚Äôm meant to desire or enjoy. It‚Äôs almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They‚Äôve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop‚Äîmy body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I‚Äôve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices‚Äîlike overeating or not avoiding tight clothes‚Äîthat exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It‚Äôs created a cycle where I feel like I‚Äôm feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body‚Äôs way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don‚Äôt want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I‚Äôve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It‚Äôs such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it‚Äôs my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it‚Äôs hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I‚Äôve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth‚Äîor if this is something I‚Äôll be living with for the rest of my life.

1hoa56l,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1hoa56l/how_to_tackle_slow_q1_and_set_up_your_brand_for/,How to Tackle Slow Q1 and Set Up Your Brand for Success in 2025,"Q1 can be one of the trickiest quarters for eCommerce brands to navigate. After the frenzy of Q4, it‚Äôs easy to feel like January and February are dead months where nothing significant can happen. But the truth is, Q1 doesn‚Äôt have to be a write-off.  
  
Instead of thinking of Q1 as a tough season to ‚Äúget through,‚Äù what if you saw it as an opportunity to refine your strategy, adapt to seasonal trends, and prepare your brand to thrive‚Äînot just survive?  
  
In this post, I‚Äôll break down how to approach Q1 strategically, how to avoid the common mistakes that hold brands back, and how you can set yourself up for success, not just in Q1 but for all of 2025.  
  
***Late Q4: The Start of the Waste***  
  
Let‚Äôs start by going back to late Q4. This is where I feel the ‚Äúwaste‚Äù actually begins.  
  
During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, one of the biggest angles that works for businesses is the gift-giving mindset. People are buying for friends, family, and loved ones. They‚Äôre not shopping for themselves‚Äîthey‚Äôre in a giving mood.  
  
But after Christmas, the sentiment shifts. The focus turns inward.  
  
Now, people might have some extra cash or gift cards they received during the holidays. Or maybe they‚Äôre just done with all the giving and finally ready to treat themselves. They‚Äôre sitting with a cup of coffee, staring out the window at the snow, enjoying a few days off work. They‚Äôre scrolling online, looking for ways to distract themselves.  
  
Some people binge movies. Others watch more videos. And plenty of them spend money for that little dopamine boost.  
  
This period‚Äîfrom right after Christmas to New Year‚Äôs‚Äîis one of the last big opportunities of the year to drive revenue. It‚Äôs the perfect time to run a New Year Sale or Boxing Day Clearance to capitalize on this mindset.  
  
  
***January: A Mixed Bag***  
  
When January rolls around, it‚Äôs no secret that the first two weeks of the month (January 1‚Äì14) are typically slow for most businesses.  
  
That said, this isn‚Äôt true across the board. Seasonal businesses, for example, can still perform well. One of our clients sells high-ticket cashmere hats for winter, and January is actually a strong month for them. Why? Because it‚Äôs still cold, and people still need hats.  
  
Similarly, businesses in health and wellness‚Äîgyms, supplement brands, fitness eCom‚Äîtend to thrive during this period. Info product businesses and B2B services also do well because of the ‚ÄúNew Year, New Me‚Äù phenomenon.  
  
This time of year is all about transformation, whether it‚Äôs physical health, personal growth, or financial success. It‚Äôs the perfect moment to pivot your messaging. If you‚Äôre selling info products or masterclasses, for example, you can tap into the mindset of people wanting to invest in themselves.  
  
But what if you‚Äôre in a harder niche, like fashion, jewelry, or skincare? For these businesses, there‚Äôs less urgency at the start of the year. People just finished a big buying cycle and may not need to replenish.  
  
In these cases, you might want to lower your ad spend during early January. But don‚Äôt ignore the ‚ÄúNew Year, New Me‚Äù energy altogether. Adjust your ad angles slightly. A skincare brand, for example, could focus on starting a new skincare regimen for the year. A fashion brand might position its products as part of a wardrobe refresh for the new year.  
  
  
***Mid-January to Mid-February: Valentine‚Äôs Day Season***  
  
By mid-January, the focus shifts again, and Valentine‚Äôs Day enters the picture. This is great news for many eCommerce brands‚Äîespecially those in the fashion, jewelry, and skincare spaces.  
  
The gift-giving mindset returns, and people are ready to shop for their partners (or themselves). This is the moment to pivot your messaging back to gifts and romance.  
  
Let me share an example.  
  
One of my client‚Äôs competitors sells bras. Recently, we noticed they‚Äôve been doing something interesting with their seasonal campaigns. They consistently update their website to match the season, tweaking their hero banners, headers, and color schemes.  
  
For instance, during December, their messaging was all about giving to yourself, with a burgundy color palette reminiscent of the holidays.

[Here is the Screenshot](https://ibb.co/71CnzC9)

Now, as the year comes to a close and sales have decreased, they are offering significant discounts and prominently displaying them in their hero section.

[Here is the Screenshot](https://ibb.co/xGKCRpR)

I can almost guarantee that by Valentine‚Äôs Day, their entire website will have pivoted to pink tones and Valentine‚Äôs themes.  
  
This seasonal congruence doesn‚Äôt just boost ad performance‚Äîit increases website conversion rates too. It‚Äôs worth considering for your own business.  
  
***Late February: Preparing for Spring***  
  
Once Valentine‚Äôs Day passes, things slow down again for many brands‚Äîespecially in niches like fashion and skincare. This late February lull is the perfect time to prepare for a spring collection launch.  
  
Launching new products at the start of March can help you re-engage your audience. It also gives you a strong start to what will likely be a much better quarter.  
  
***April Onwards: The Start of Evergreen Growth***  
  
By the time April rolls around, consumer sentiment improves naturally. People are finally recovering from the financial strain of the holidays. The weather starts getting better. They‚Äôre ready to spend again‚Äîboth for themselves and for others.  
  
This is when your Evergreen campaigns should begin to shine again.  
  
To summarize this post,  
  
Late December is about self-gifting and post-holiday sales.  
  
Early January taps into ‚ÄúNew Year, New Me‚Äù energy.  
  
Mid-January to mid-February revolves around Valentine‚Äôs Day.  
  
Late February is your time to prep for spring and product launches.  
  
Hope this helps! ",2,1735405935.0,FacebookAds,0,1.0,False
1hoa4to,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1hoa4to/i_scream_out_and_yell_i_didnt_fall_asleep_in_that/,"I scream out, and yell ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt fall asleep in that device. I know this isn‚Äôt my bedroom or home! What the fuck do you want?‚Äù ","I‚Äôve lucid dreamed my whole life but NEVER had a dream so twisted as this:

I am with my mom going to some large hospital. When I am inside I travel through the halls and abruptly a robotic device zooms down the hall behind me with something its delivering. I ignore it. Feeling like I am being watched. I continue walking, looking for a way out. My mother no longer with me for who knows how long. I walk pass a window that appears to have surgeons working on a draped body of some sort. It doesn‚Äôt appear human. I begin to feel unsafe and the need to escape from this facility increases to alarm. 
I walk down the next hallway and hear another delivery robot coming and I tuck inside the nearest door. The robot is smart enough and finds me. This time delivering a note as well as a bag. The note read, ‚ÄúTake the bag or others will die‚Äù. 
I dart out the hallway. Leaving the robot and bag behind. 
‚ÄúWhat others?‚Äù I think. Where is my mom and is Zak (my husband) okay? 

My heart is racing and I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt know this facility and whatever those surgeons were working on wasn‚Äôt hu - 
I freeze as a women comes down the hall directly toward me. Small, but with seriousness on her face. Our eyes meet and before I could take another step she pulls a gun out of the pocket of her scrub jacket. It‚Äôs pointed at me.  She works here. She knows I am trying to find an escape. 
The note, now the gun. Where the fuck am I?

She‚Äôs leading me to where I hear others are being held. I worry where Zak might be. Is he here too? I look down and notice I‚Äôm holding a bag. When did I get this and is this the bag the robot tried giving to me. Should I have just taken the bag from the first or even the second robot? I couldn‚Äôt trust anything or anyone in this place. 

Another facility worker, a man with red hair is presiding over a group of children. The woman leads me towards him. He looks away from the children at me with a small expression of surprise and satisfaction. He smiles at me. Warmly, but in a way that warns me that he‚Äôs more dangerous that the women with the gun. 

I notice my bag is the same as what all the children have and play with. It‚Äôs a bag full of keys on various key rings. There had to be 30 or more keys in this bag. This is making no sense. The children at closer inspection weren‚Äôt really playing. They were given a task and it was to throw a set of keys across the yard and into a ‚Äúnet‚Äù. A girl closest to me is throwing as hard as she can and she hits her target. She moves closer, with each keyring that makes it in the net. All the children aim for the net. Is this how I can escape? 

I reach into the bag and throw as hard as I can and I miss and miss. I know I‚Äôm a better aim than that. Why can‚Äôt I control my throws? The man notices my attempts and laughs. I desperately don‚Äôt want his attention on me but it‚Äôs too late. He comes over to me and hands me another set of keys to throw again. But I just stand there. Holding the keys and trying to read his face, but I can‚Äôt read his as well as I know he can read mine. 

The man announces a change of task at hand. We were all to line up facing a wall to the facility. I look down the line and there is Zak. Oh god, I‚Äôm relieved but also so scared that we both now have to escape. ‚ÄúWall jumps!‚Äù He yells. 

Fuck. I hate wall jumps after years of volleyball practice and this being our coaches favorite conditioning exercises. But as much as I hate them, I am very good at them. I squat, jump and reach for the wall. I can do this I think to myself, I can do this. I‚Äôm outta breath but keep jumping. I look up with my next jump and realize I‚Äôve been jumping higher every time. On my next jump I reach high enough to grab the top of the wall and pull myself up. 

Zak notices but no one else including the facility workers notice me. I slowly move down to where Zak is jumping and he reaches the top and climbs up next to me. We make eye contact without saying a word we begin to climb across this level or roof on the facility. I think we‚Äôre going to escape. I‚Äôm hopeful and out of breath. 

It‚Äôs not flat up here. Rounded sky lights are scattered all over, making for good places to hide behind if someone spots us. I stumbled and caught myself before falling through one of the sky lights. They‚Äôre very fragile and I damage this one pretty good. God I hope none of the workers heard that.  I peer down to see what I might have fallen onto and see the surgeons from earlier and the body. It‚Äôs insides are open, and exposed and the most horrible yellow bodily fluid color and tone. It‚Äôs not human whatever they are operating on. 

Zak jerks me aways from the scene below. Someone else is up here and they did hear me. A man is across the roof and staring at us. He looked surprised and confused as to why we were up there. He only gestures with his hand to follow him. He moves quietly and with intensity. We follow. 

He‚Äôs been up here a while and we walk past what appears to be an old skylight made into a shelter. This man‚Äôs shelter. Does this mean he‚Äôs been here because he hasn‚Äôt been able to escape? Our conversation was brief and he said that down below was a door to a side yard of the facility. He would go down and around to where the children and other workers were and we would go out the door. 

My heart is racing but we have to get out. We‚Äôre at the door it‚Äôs unlocked and we bolt out hugging the wall to the right. Its fenced but I didn‚Äôt care, it was one step closer to getting out. We‚Äôre not even 5 yards out the door and the man from inside shouts and we see movement from the other side of the yard. Facility workers but not dressed as the man and women from earlier. These were military personnel with guns. 

We were spotted and immediately spun back and into the door we came. We couldn‚Äôt have made it across the yard without being killed. No hope left we slam the door closed but not in time before a shot rang out. 
The man helping us was hit and bleeding. Terror runs through me as military and facility personnel fill the area we‚Äôre in. Zak and I taken and separated. 

The room I was put in has medical technology all around. I‚Äôm the only one in here.  I don‚Äôt fear for my life necessarily but I do think of the body and those surgeons. 
Over an intercom I‚Äôm instructed to lie down on a table with cords, lines and wires all around. I do what the voice commands. The final instruction was to lower what looks like an occulus onto my head. It‚Äôs entirely dark and I begin to feel drowsy. 

I tell myself, stay awake. You‚Äôre not really going to sleep. Stay awake, stay aware. This is a mind trick. My body is so relaxed, I could drift off any moment. I‚Äôm commanding, willing myself to not fall asleep. Time passes, I don‚Äôt know the length but I know I didn‚Äôt fall asleep. Although my eyes were closed, I was very mindful, even meditative. I begin to project my consciousness out of my body to try and see where I was. I was no longer in the room of the  facility somewhere else I between there and where I was. I feel calm and in control knowing that I didn‚Äôt fall asleep. I wouldn‚Äôt let that facility play any tricks on me. 

When my eyes do open, I‚Äôm lying in bed at home. Next to Zak warm and comfortable against his chest. I take in the familiar details of our room and notice at our feet the bed frame. It‚Äôs not our bed frame. In that moment of recognition, it falls to the floor waking Zak. I turn to look at him and tried to say with my only eyes it‚Äôs not our bedroom. It‚Äôs the facility disguised. But god, we‚Äôre terrible at times to communicate with words. How on earth would we do it just with eye contact? I flare my nostrils over and over. Something I‚Äôm good at but it‚Äôs not enough. Zak kisses me good morning, let‚Äôs out a big stretch and growl. 

 I know they‚Äôre watching and listening to everything. I'll play it normal, until I can safely warn him that this is the facility and we never left. He gets up and goes to the bathroom and I notice the hallway get smaller after he passes through it. That‚Äôs weird. I get out of bed and decide to go make coffee. I pass through the hallway and look back. The hallway got even smaller behind me. So narrow that even if I tried to go back I could pass through. What kind of fuckery is this and what the fuck does this facility want with us? I scream out, and yelling ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt fall asleep in that device. I know this isn‚Äôt my bedroom or home! What the fuck do you want?‚Äù

In an instant my bedroom is gone and so is Zak.

Obligatory long time lurker first time poster. I‚Äôm not sure how to add trigger warning or anything of the like. I don‚Äôt know where to really start please forgive me if this is all over the place. I have been with my children‚Äôs father for over a decade. Always had some mild health issues that had a very minimal impact on my day to functioning, but overall I was able to do what I needed to do and get through the day. I was the primary parent until about three years ago, constantly dealing with my children‚Äôs health and mental health as well as school and the day to day of their care. This only changed when their father decided to become a stay at home dad (it was the best decision at the time as our oldest has needs that essentially make it more practical for one of us to be available at the drop of a hat and with my career at the time there were times I was in a different county). Side note I absolutely loved my career and worked hard to complete my schooling while having a toddler that had severe physical/emotional needs and falling pregnant during the schooling. I gave birth between semesters and continued all while maintaining a 4.0 GPA and being the only parent cleaning cooking and taking care of the house and children. All is okay ish until earier this year, my health had been slowly slipping downward and then our house was flooded. I don‚Äôt mean a little water in the basement I mean we had to be evacuated twice to get to safety. After the first evacuation I was inside the evacuation site with all three children when a life or death situation happened and the room we were in partially collapsed and was swept away. I got all three kids and myself to safety by the time he rejoined us. I had a feeling something was going to happen and did not let them get out of arms reach thankfully. If they would‚Äôve say where it was suggested and played they would‚Äôve been gone with the wall. After going through all of that we were temporarily homeless until I was able to buy a home in a neighboring town. After we were able to go back to the old house when it was safe ish, I went and had a panic attack and afterwards had a lot of trouble breathing and began to have more frequent asthma attacks and health issues. I attributed it to anxiety over what had happened there. While touring with FEMA to assess the damages we realized there was a lot of mold in the home and the objects that were in it. Over the next few days I rapidly got worse and all of the little health issues I previously dealt with that were manageable were completely blown out of the water and I have had long term health issues since. It got to the point my children‚Äôs father and I decided it was best for me to quit my job as I was unable to drive. Since I‚Äôve seen countless specialists and have had many ER visits including a concussion due to passing out from a dizzy spell. None of my health issues have really gotten better and I am hoping with some appointments in the next month we can get a plan figured out moving forward with my care team. The one thing they have all said is how crucial it is for me to rest. I have a young child that wakes up through the night still and I am the only one who gets up with them. So there are lots of times during the day I am just exhausted and will sleep in later than I ever have before. I am trying to help my body by resting, pushing my body to do more has caused damage (the concussion) and made recovery harder. I‚Äôm not sure if I mentioned this but I am allergic to mold. Doctors have said my body is having a full histamine response almost like I‚Äôm constantly having an allergic response. I am a shell of the woman and mother I once was and I am aware of that. Through all of this my children‚Äôs father picked up what I dropped and took on essentially caring for everyone in the home, not without pointing it out to me daily I should add. Some days are better than others and I‚Äôm able to do little things here and there. In six months I‚Äôve driven a handful of times, mostly to the doctor or for groceries because if I don‚Äôt then our food budget gets spent on things the kids won‚Äôt eat (our oldest has sensory issues that play a big role in what he does and does not eat). This is a once in every few weeks occurrence and only when I am feeling comfortable driving as I have issues with getting dizzy most days. Recently I‚Äôve been really struggling and have had to cancel appointments because I don‚Äôt have transportation (read as he won‚Äôt drive me because he wants to clean or work on this project or something else) so I have had to reschedule as my specialists are over an hour away and I am terrified to drive that far on my own. The furthest I‚Äôve driven since this happened was 10 minutes away and I had to sit in the car to recover just as long as I drove. I have not been able to drive my children to or from school, but I try to make sure I come along for the ride with their father so that I can still be involved and will walk them to the school. It takes a lot out of me and i admit I have to rest afterwards for some time. I try to help with house work but there are many many days I am unable to really take care of myself let alone help with the housework. I shower with my Apple Watch and have fall detection on and won‚Äôt shower when I am home alone because that is how afraid I am to fall and get hurt because it has happened. Like I said before everything is fallen on my children‚Äôs father. Whenever I do something around the house I am immediately told I did it wrong or didn‚Äôt do what he needed help with and just shouldn‚Äôt have done anything if I wasn‚Äôt going to listen which has made me want to not even try but I still do on my better days. Everything has come to a head over Christmas. He was in a rotten mood in the morning and told the kids they can open gifts when he went to go outside to smoke and get coffee. So he didn‚Äôt want to be a part of that from what I understood as I had originally told them to wait. He gets upset and said he needed to get the food started which confused me and I asked why he planned to make a big meal knowing we were going to families for a meal and gift exchange. He then got very upset and screamed that he will just cancel dinner with his mom then since I don‚Äôt want her there. I never said that and actually would‚Äôve loved for her to come over, her and I have a good relationship although the two of them have a different mother son relationship due to some things that happened when he was growing up that we‚Äôre not her fault and how his own father treated her and him. I did not know he planned to make a big meal as we did not have anything to prepare it besides a turkey. I simply asked why he would make a meal like this and he went off. Christmas at families he sat there brewing on his phone ignoring the kids opening their gifts. Then he got his plate and started eating before they were done unwrapping. I ended up making a plate for the kids and then tried to eat myself, our youngest got upset and I tried to calm him while also helping get our kids gifts they wanted to play with opened. He ignored me asking for help until another family member said something and then he got our youngest (our youngest is very attached to him due to him being the stay at home parent) after a minute or two he put him on the floor where our youngest began to cry. He wouldn‚Äôt even respond when anyone tried to talk to him so I went and picked our youngest up off the floor and said it would really be nice if I could eat at all. Which he replied that he was trying. He begins to get upset about the amount of gifts our three children received and the thing that set him off was our oldest two received some type of hovercraft ride on type toy. He called me outside to try to talk so I tried to make sure our three children were okay inside before I went out. I did not make it out yet by the time that he came back in and yelled at me to come outside. I reminded him I have to make sure our kids are okay and then I will be out. He said something about needing to put all the stuff in the vehicle and two family members when out to help as they know I physically am not much help right now and could see how drained I was. He then comes in and in not so nice words demand I get outside there was swearing involved and at this point I had enough and snapped a little bit that I was trying to get there (our youngest was very upset and it was single digits temperature outside so I didn‚Äôt want to step out with him) I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I said but it was along the lines of you don‚Äôt get to ignore us and then demand my attention and that he was being rude. I come out and he yells at me that he is going to throw our children‚Äôs gifts in the river and he doesn‚Äôt want them. We went back and forth a bit and I ended up telling him to wait in the car and I would get our kids around and it was time to leave. Note that I did not get to eat more than a few bites. Later he told me that didn‚Äôt matter because of how fat I am anyways. I have gained weight recently as I‚Äôve been on a steroid almost nonstop because of my health issues. Something I stopped taking as he brought up my weight before. So I‚Äôve been going without in attempts to lose some weight (which I have lost 10 pounds in a few weeks) I am a bigger girl and having kids made me bigger. Before starting the steroids I was a little under the weight I was when I first got pregnant with my youngest. Afterwards I have become the heaviest I have ever been and I am very uncomfortable with myself in just about every way right now. After telling our kids they shouldn‚Äôt like the gifts they were given because they sucked he told them that later that night he would dump them in the river (we were over a bridge when he said that) and our oldest absolutely lost it and started screaming and crying that he ruined Christmas. The rest of the night was spent with him convincing the kids that they had a terrible Christmas because of everyone else. This included him throwing away the turkey he had put in earlier and then refusing to make anything else. I ended up making the kids some ramen. It wasnt the best meal by any means it was just the noodle and broth, but I did what I could to feed us. That night I somehow managed to stay up with our youngest until almost 3 in the morning. After the long day and staying up late I slept until my youngest woke up on his own which ended up being closer to 11 in the morning. I‚Äôve never slept that late but it was needed and my body was still tired after waking up. He then proceeds to repeatedly yell at me for sleeping so long. We end up doing things with our kids the rest of the day which absolutely drained me even more I was having a hard time by dinner time which he then says I need to go to the store and get xyz. I somehow manage to get to the store and barely make it through and ended up sitting in the car for awhile before I‚Äôm able to load up the groceries and leave. There was bickering on and off the rest of the night with me asking him a few times to please go somewhere else. Then yesterday I woke up having a really hard time breathing. I do my nebulizer and use my inhaler. Doesn‚Äôt really seem to help. Try the steroids in the nebulizer they helped very briefly then he started to yell at me after I fell off the couch (I was sitting on the edge trying my inhaler) between gasps I‚Äôm asking him to call for help as I couldn‚Äôt breathe. He refuses and also refuses to take me to the hospital. I was able to use my watch to get ahold of my mom and she came and took me to the emergency room. During the time I waited for her he yelled  at me that he was going to leave me when I get too fat to take care of myself and have a tube in my throw because I won‚Äôt just get up and lose weight. Told me I was disgusting a bad mom he hoped I died so many nasty things. Then he screamed that he couldn‚Äôt take me seriously because I won‚Äôt just rub his foot. The one boundary I have had our entire relationship is I will not touch feet. I always brushed it off as they are just not something I want to touch. Last night I broke down and told him it had to do with an assault that he was very well aware of that happened before we got together. I had told him previously when I was having issues with intimacy as it was really impacting me at the beginning of our relationship and during the assault the assaulted had a weird obsession with feet. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt touch them because of that. I don‚Äôt even touch my own feet unless absolutely necessary. He went off about if that‚Äôs what he has to do to get a foot rub he will. He literally told me he will assault me as well if that‚Äôs what it will take for me to touch his feet. For obvious reasons I completely broke down at that remark because WHAT?!? I demand he leave my house. He tells me he will and tries to take the keys to my van. I stopped him and told him he can take his car but he will not take my vehicle with my children‚Äôs gifts still in the back (he had told he was going to get rid of them) and then when he finally left to get a pack of cigarettes I locked the doors and windows. He almost broke the window (i bought new windows for every room but that room as they are newer windows already) so I unlocked the door and let him in and told him he needed to get something and leave. He then broke a mug and held it up like he was going to stab me. There was a lot of fighting and yelling which he yelled again he would assault me. I told him he needed to leave and he said I have to evict him he has a right to be here and that as soon as I did that he would file for full emergency custody of the kids (something his dad did when he was younger and was granted due to lies) he refuses to leave and said if I call the police he will make sure I‚Äôm the one who leaves and that I will not be allowed to see our children. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt leave them with him. I told him he can move his things somewhere else in the house then until we figure out where he is going but he is insisting he will not leave and that if I would just get rid of the hoverboard toys our kids got that he was willing to go back to how things were? I don‚Äôt want that at all and told him so and he said I ruined our family. I know a lot has been put on him but it is no more than what was previously on my plate. When I left my job I cashed out my retirement plan and used that to advance pay the mortgage and as many bills as I could ontop of draining all of my savings. I am currently waiting to hear from social security due to my health issues at this time.

I'm still a new driver (had my car for 4 months), and today went into town to get a coffee with my partner and his family. I parked in a car park nearby but my partner convinced me to try parking in the tiny cramped coffee shop car park instead as it was free (but very busy and with slanted car spaces / not much space to maneouvre). I did say I didn't want to ask it was busy and I'm not super confident with parking yet in our car but he didn't want to pay for the parking in the car park.

For some reason my brain thought it was a good idea to reverse park into the space I found but I wasn't far forward enough so had a nightmare parking and readjusting as I had no room. My partners mum was trying to help but was standing really close to my car and I went over he toe slightly so she started screaming ow (her toe is fine). This stressed me out more and cars were waiting for me so they could go past and my foot was shaking as I was so stressed out. 

I eventually parked but was so embarrassed I almost burst into tears. This has really dented my confidence and I am just going over and over it in my head.

How do you learn to let these things go and move on? I worry people are just going to think I'm a rubbish driver when I've come such a long way these past few months. ",3,1735404917.0,drivinganxiety,2,1.0,False

now, two days ago just finishing my work shift my mom texted me asking of we could meet up one day to grab a coffee and she'll give me my christmas gift (we all spent christmas with dad, and my siblings are going to spend new years with mom) and I thought, maybe, maybe, I could spend new years with her right? try to, at least. that's all my father side family has been asking me to: have a good relationship with my mom, so I tell her, that I'm not sure since I still don't know if I work those days, but if I do not, I'll spend new years with her. 

I told my grandma this vaguely since she made a joke about me taking care of part of the food for new years, this was yesterday (27th of December) and I said that most likely I wasn't going to be here because I'm going to spend it with my mom. right there, I realized her tone even if she said that It was good and told her: if you don't want me to go then I won't go. my dad found out this morning through my grandma, and I just had an awful conversation with him, he basically told me that I did wrong, he reassured so many times that its good that I chose to want to spend time with my mom, but what I did is closing the door in my dad's family's face, treating them just like my mom did with me in mother's day, I swear he said too many times that it's good that I want to be with my mom, but at the same time made it sound that it wasn't. I guess he guilt tripped me? because he said that then new years eve is going to be spend just my grandma my aunt and him, he said that he planned on this because of me, because he could've planned on spending it with friends, or the three of them could've gone vacationing (which he said they didn't because of my work) and I'm just startled? I can be here for the entire year, I was here last new years, I am here every day. and he makes me feel bad because I chose to spend new years with my mom? and I told him that, and he denied it once again, but he said that it's my choice to do this last minute when everything is already planned (which nobody actually told me anything, not like last new years that we spend it at his ex's parents' place, then i did know where and what we were going to do, this time i wasnt told anything other than my grandma yesterday saying almost joking that i am in charge of making the potato salad) what hurts them all, because it's me shutting the door in their faces, leaving them alone, when all other family members are dead and he made me feel so guilty.

I‚Äôm not sure how to add trigger warning or anything of the like. I don‚Äôt know where to really start please forgive me if this is all over the place. I have been with my children‚Äôs father for over a decade. Always had some mild health issues that had a very minimal impact on my day to functioning, but overall I was able to do what I needed to do and get through the day. I was the primary parent until about three years ago, constantly dealing with my children‚Äôs health and mental health as well as school and the day to day of their care. This only changed when their father decided to become a stay at home dad (it was the best decision at the time as our oldest has needs that essentially make it more practical for one of us to be available at the drop of a hat and with my career at the time there were times I was in a different county). Side note I absolutely loved my career and worked hard to complete my schooling while having a toddler that had severe physical/emotional needs and falling pregnant during the schooling. I gave birth between semesters and continued all while maintaining a 4.0 GPA and being the only parent cleaning cooking and taking care of the house and children. All is okay ish until earier this year, my health had been slowly slipping downward and then our house was flooded. I don‚Äôt mean a little water in the basement I mean we had to be evacuated twice to get to safety. After the first evacuation I was inside the evacuation site with all three children when a life or death situation happened and the room we were in partially collapsed and was swept away. I got all three kids and myself to safety by the time he rejoined us. I had a feeling something was going to happen and did not let them get out of arms reach thankfully. If they would‚Äôve say where it was suggested and played they would‚Äôve been gone with the wall. After going through all of that we were temporarily homeless until I was able to buy a home in a neighboring town. After we were able to go back to the old house when it was safe ish, I went and had a panic attack and afterwards had a lot of trouble breathing and began to have more frequent asthma attacks and health issues. I attributed it to anxiety over what had happened there. While touring with FEMA to assess the damages we realized there was a lot of mold in the home and the objects that were in it. Over the next few days I rapidly got worse and all of the little health issues I previously dealt with that were manageable were completely blown out of the water and I have had long term health issues since. It got to the point my children‚Äôs father and I decided it was best for me to quit my job as I was unable to drive. Since I‚Äôve seen countless specialists and have had many ER visits including a concussion due to passing out from a dizzy spell. None of my health issues have really gotten better and I am hoping with some appointments in the next month we can get a plan figured out moving forward with my care team. The one thing they have all said is how crucial it is for me to rest. I have a young child that wakes up through the night still and I am the only one who gets up with them. So there are lots of times during the day I am just exhausted and will sleep in later than I ever have before. I am trying to help my body by resting, pushing my body to do more has caused damage (the concussion) and made recovery harder. I‚Äôm not sure if I mentioned this but I am allergic to mold. Doctors have said my body is having a full histamine response almost like I‚Äôm constantly having an allergic response. I am a shell of the woman and mother I once was and I am aware of that. Through all of this my children‚Äôs father picked up what I dropped and took on essentially caring for everyone in the home, not without pointing it out to me daily I should add. Some days are better than others and I‚Äôm able to do little things here and there. In six months I‚Äôve driven a handful of times, mostly to the doctor or for groceries because if I don‚Äôt then our food budget gets spent on things the kids won‚Äôt eat (our oldest has sensory issues that play a big role in what he does and does not eat). This is a once in every few weeks occurrence and only when I am feeling comfortable driving as I have issues with getting dizzy most days. Recently I‚Äôve been really struggling and have had to cancel appointments because I don‚Äôt have transportation (read as he won‚Äôt drive me because he wants to clean or work on this project or something else) so I have had to reschedule as my specialists are over an hour away and I am terrified to drive that far on my own. The furthest I‚Äôve driven since this happened was 10 minutes away and I had to sit in the car to recover just as long as I drove. I have not been able to drive my children to or from school, but I try to make sure I come along for the ride with their father so that I can still be involved and will walk them to the school. It takes a lot out of me and i admit I have to rest afterwards for some time. I try to help with house work but there are many many days I am unable to really take care of myself let alone help with the housework. I shower with my Apple Watch and have fall detection on and won‚Äôt shower when I am home alone because that is how afraid I am to fall and get hurt because it has happened. Like I said before everything is fallen on my children‚Äôs father. Whenever I do something around the house I am immediately told I did it wrong or didn‚Äôt do what he needed help with and just shouldn‚Äôt have done anything if I wasn‚Äôt going to listen which has made me want to not even try but I still do on my better days. Everything has come to a head over Christmas. He was in a rotten mood in the morning and told the kids they can open gifts when he went to go outside to smoke and get coffee. So he didn‚Äôt want to be a part of that from what I understood as I had originally told them to wait. He gets upset and said he needed to get the food started which confused me and I asked why he planned to make a big meal knowing we were going to families for a meal and gift exchange. He then got very upset and screamed that he will just cancel dinner with his mom then since I don‚Äôt want her there. I never said that and actually would‚Äôve loved for her to come over, her and I have a good relationship although the two of them have a different mother son relationship due to some things that happened when he was growing up that we‚Äôre not her fault and how his own father treated her and him. I did not know he planned to make a big meal as we did not have anything to prepare it besides a turkey. I simply asked why he would make a meal like this and he went off. Christmas at families he sat there brewing on his phone ignoring the kids opening their gifts. Then he got his plate and started eating before they were done unwrapping. I ended up making a plate for the kids and then tried to eat myself, our youngest got upset and I tried to calm him while also helping get our kids gifts they wanted to play with opened. He ignored me asking for help until another family member said something and then he got our youngest (our youngest is very attached to him due to him being the stay at home parent) after a minute or two he put him on the floor where our youngest began to cry. He wouldn‚Äôt even respond when anyone tried to talk to him so I went and picked our youngest up off the floor and said it would really be nice if I could eat at all. Which he replied that he was trying. He begins to get upset about the amount of gifts our three children received and the thing that set him off was our oldest two received some type of hovercraft ride on type toy. He called me outside to try to talk so I tried to make sure our three children were okay inside before I went out. I did not make it out yet by the time that he came back in and yelled at me to come outside. I reminded him I have to make sure our kids are okay and then I will be out. He said something about needing to put all the stuff in the vehicle and two family members when out to help as they know I physically am not much help right now and could see how drained I was. He then comes in and in not so nice words demand I get outside there was swearing involved and at this point I had enough and snapped a little bit that I was trying to get there (our youngest was very upset and it was single digits temperature outside so I didn‚Äôt want to step out with him) I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I said but it was along the lines of you don‚Äôt get to ignore us and then demand my attention and that he was being rude. I come out and he yells at me that he is going to throw our children‚Äôs gifts in the river and he doesn‚Äôt want them. We went back and forth a bit and I ended up telling him to wait in the car and I would get our kids around and it was time to leave. Note that I did not get to eat more than a few bites. Later he told me that didn‚Äôt matter because of how fat I am anyways. I have gained weight recently as I‚Äôve been on a steroid almost nonstop because of my health issues. Something I stopped taking as he brought up my weight before. So I‚Äôve been going without in attempts to lose some weight (which I have lost 10 pounds in a few weeks) I am a bigger girl and having kids made me bigger. Before starting the steroids I was a little under the weight I was when I first got pregnant with my youngest. Afterwards I have become the heaviest I have ever been and I am very uncomfortable with myself in just about every way right now. After telling our kids they shouldn‚Äôt like the gifts they were given because they sucked he told them that later that night he would dump them in the river (we were over a bridge when he said that) and our oldest absolutely lost it and started screaming and crying that he ruined Christmas. The rest of the night was spent with him convincing the kids that they had a terrible Christmas because of everyone else. This included him throwing away the turkey he had put in earlier and then refusing to make anything else. I ended up making the kids some ramen. It wasnt the best meal by any means it was just the noodle and broth, but I did what I could to feed us. That night I somehow managed to stay up with our youngest until almost 3 in the morning. After the long day and staying up late I slept until my youngest woke up on his own which ended up being closer to 11 in the morning. I‚Äôve never slept that late but it was needed and my body was still tired after waking up. He then proceeds to repeatedly yell at me for sleeping so long. We end up doing things with our kids the rest of the day which absolutely drained me even more I was having a hard time by dinner time which he then says I need to go to the store and get xyz. I somehow manage to get to the store and barely make it through and ended up sitting in the car for awhile before I‚Äôm able to load up the groceries and leave. There was bickering on and off the rest of the night with me asking him a few times to please go somewhere else. Then yesterday I woke up having a really hard time breathing. I do my nebulizer and use my inhaler. Doesn‚Äôt really seem to help. Try the steroids in the nebulizer they helped very briefly then he started to yell at me after I fell off the couch (I was sitting on the edge trying my inhaler) between gasps I‚Äôm asking him to call for help as I couldn‚Äôt breathe. He refuses and also refuses to take me to the hospital. I was able to use my watch to get ahold of my mom and she came and took me to the emergency room. During the time I waited for her he yelled  at me that he was going to leave me when I get too fat to take care of myself and have a tube in my throw because I won‚Äôt just get up and lose weight. Told me I was disgusting a bad mom he hoped I died so many nasty things. Then he screamed that he couldn‚Äôt take me seriously because I won‚Äôt just rub his foot. The one boundary I have had our entire relationship is I will not touch feet. I always brushed it off as they are just not something I want to touch. Last night I broke down and told him it had to do with an assault that he was very well aware of that happened before we got together. I had told him previously when I was having issues with intimacy as it was really impacting me at the beginning of our relationship and during the assault the assaulted had a weird obsession with feet. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt touch them because of that. I don‚Äôt even touch my own feet unless absolutely necessary. He went off about if that‚Äôs what he has to do to get a foot rub he will. He literally told me he will assault me as well if that‚Äôs what it will take for me to touch his feet. For obvious reasons I completely broke down at that remark because WHAT?!? I demand he leave my house. He tells me he will and tries to take the keys to my van. I stopped him and told him he can take his car but he will not take my vehicle with my children‚Äôs gifts still in the back (he had told he was going to get rid of them) and then when he finally left to get a pack of cigarettes I locked the doors and windows. He almost broke the window (i bought new windows for every room but that room as they are newer windows already) so I unlocked the door and let him in and told him he needed to get something and leave. He then broke a mug and held it up like he was going to stab me. There was a lot of fighting and yelling which he yelled again he would assault me. I told him he needed to leave and he said I have to evict him he has a right to be here and that as soon as I did that he would file for full emergency custody of the kids (something his dad did when he was younger and was granted due to lies) he refuses to leave and said if I call the police he will make sure I‚Äôm the one who leaves and that I will not be allowed to see our children. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt leave them with him. I told him he can move his things somewhere else in the house then until we figure out where he is going but he is insisting he will not leave and that if I would just get rid of the hoverboard toys our kids got that he was willing to go back to how things were? I don‚Äôt want that at all and told him so and he said I ruined our family. I know a lot has been put on him but it is no more than what was previously on my plate. When I left my job I cashed out my retirement plan and used that to advance pay the mortgage and as many bills as I could ontop of draining all of my savings. I am currently waiting to hear from social security due to my health issues at this time. AITAH for not physically being able to do more and it falling on my children‚Äôs father?

I‚Äôve been heavily addicted to caffeine for years. Whenever I tried to take breaks, it‚Äôd be for a very short time, like few days or weeks. I was so dependent on it that no other drink could replace it, and my day felt incomplete without at least one cup of coffee. The past two years I had bad anxiety and panic attacks, and caffeine would give me a rush that boosts both my anxiety levels and mental energy, and makes me restless, which I got used to and became my norm. 

I started having decaf coffee few months ago, it was better but my body still had this heavy and dependent feeling when I had it, like my activities and moods throughout the day are still influenced by this one drink. This December I decided to stop drinking coffee until the end of the year. Now I completed one month without it! 

My anxiety has improved significantly, I rarely have racing thoughts, and I‚Äôm much better at grounding myself and meditating. I have better sleep, less restlessness, even better diet, and focus abilities. It‚Äôs easier for me to go longer without it now and I‚Äôm planning to cut it down all together.

For some context, Sofia is married with a child (4m) and a Husband (30M) with another one on the way, I am single, working 2 jobs, and have a JD I am finishing up. I would like a family later down the line but I rather save up first and move out. 

Anyways so Dilemma started around January this year, her husband and her were evicted and moved back to family home. With her brothers in law, MIL, and FIL. Her in-laws have a certain way of parenting, and watch her son at work. 

Sofia and her in-laws would argue who is right in parenting. I stay out of it. I let her vent to me but overall I tell both of them to not expect me to do anything to change any of the two minds because it's not my place. So their relationship is rocky best. 

The first incident happened earlier in June, I invited my friend out, Sofia and her MIL were fighting and Sofia wanted time apart. So we took her son to the Farmer's market. We bought cool things, and she did not want the day to end. So in a last second idea I invited her over.

At my house, Sofia sat on the couch immediately and her son, who is the sweetest thing, sat at the dining room table and began to color by himself. I was cleaning up because my mom came home from work and I felt bad I didn't do the dishes. So I did the dishes, wiped the counter, put the food I bought away, and entertained Sofia's son because he was getting antsy. I put on the y2k clean music and began dancing silly with him joining in.

Sofia was on the couch on her phone planning a vacation with her brother. My mom saw this and immediately looked at me funny but said nothing, my younger sister came to help me for a bit before she had to go, she helped me entertain the boy and we played with some nerf guns we had lying around. 

Sofia barely moved, only to eat lunch I made and get her credit card from the car leaving her son with me without saying a word. I was a bit surprised but I didn't say anything at the moment. I just worried her kid may freak and start crying so I made him laugh more. 

When they left, I cleaned up the toys, vacuum, mopped, and bloomed the living room and cleaned up the mess made before passing out in the couch. I made plans that evening but due to I guess exhaustion I slept past the time and texted my friends later to enjoy without me I was beat. My mom looked to me and said, ""I don't want that girl in my house if she is not gonna watch her kid."" My sister sided woth her regarding this but I thought it must have been nice to relax and not have someone nag so I let it go.

Well it cost me, later in October, she called me in a frenzy saying she was sick she was worried she was gonna lose the baby (she just found out she was pregnant) and couldn't babysit like she promised that night to our friend and ask if I could do it. I didn't have anything going on that night and they promised to pay me. So I said, okay.

Well I had to drive to their house fast, and the other friend was so happy, I hung out , made ramen for her kids and had fun. Got them both into bed and studied lectures from my professors. They got back around 1 am I got paid and left. The next day I called my friend worried, she then answered, ""Oh my bad, I am fine now."" She hung up before I could ask questions but I immediately knew what was up.

The same thing happened another time but her husband found out and took me to the side and said, I should not do it to feel bad and to not give her an out. To hold my ground so she could set a good example to their son.

 I could tell he was frustrated. I assured it was of my own choice but then he lectured how I may be acting Naive now but it would not sit well if the person who was kind to their family was being taken advantage of, and he would talk to her about how she has been acting as if I am a free childcare and free maid.

 Sofia's MIL and FIL also pulled me aside had a cup of coffee and told me that I should focus on being a friend rather than being a helper. They appreciate all I have done but they are not happy with her and how she has been acting. 

I immediately tried to stop them trying to defend her but then Sofia's MIL gave me the full story of how Sofia has not been doing her part to watch her kid and to not contribute in the house, calling her family just temporarily staying and not doing a lot around the house. Sofia MIL then begged me to not conform to her whims and instead form boundaries that they cannot do. 

I immediately began thinking to all the stories she told and feel a little betrayed that I have not been told the full picture, maybe because she was afraid I would lecture her or whatever. I don't know bit immediately I became distant admittedly not answering calls or taking her babysitting jobs anymore.

Am I overreacting? Am I thinking too deeply or being harsh?

My experience yesterday was pretty decent from what I've read from others. Only side effect I went through was felt a lil stoned (minus munchies) around 3 PM that only last an hour. Wasn't bad though! Just folded some laundry and listened to music. So rather pleasant other than I knew I couldn't drive. 

Sleep wise, it was okay but before joining this Hers program, I wake up maybe 2 to 5 times a night. Been this way since I was a kid and probably inherited it from a parent. I was easily able to go back to sleep. 

Today:
At 9, I took one tablet of bupropion with my scrambled eggs topped a lil bit of cheese to go with my one cup of coffee. Chugging water like it is going out of style. 

Doing a body wrap for an hour that burns about 500 calories. Going for a walk with the dog later for about 45+ minutes too. 

Lunch is a blueberry protein smoothie again but that honestly filled me up easily yesterday. Side note, tastes like a blueberry muffin. 

I'll be monitoring how I feel between 2 and 4 today, and if there is any ""stone"" feeling. 
My biggest concern is that topiramate + B12 is what made me bit loopy. I can't be performing at my job like that hence why I am trying this over the weekend. If that's the case, I was advised from others here to take it before bed.

I think he wanted me to find it.,"I‚Äôm a pretty solitary person. I like my alone time. The very definition of an introvert. I took out extra student loans in college to afford a solo dorm room. That‚Äôs how serious I am about it. In order to escape humanity, I have several secluded, quiet places I like to visit throughout the week, just to get a breath of air. 

They‚Äôre my secret hideouts where I recharge. A hidden glade in the woods by my apartment, an abandoned path at the end of my block leading to a lookout above the freeway, the roof of my complex only accessible by fire escape. Nobody ever goes to any of these places but me. They‚Äôre mine, and when I‚Äôm there, I feel safe, set apart from the world.

So when I found an iPhone placed conspicuously where I usually sit in the glade, I became pretty upset. It was a mild summer afternoon, the perfect weather to spend an hour in my woodsy retreat. But my succor was spoiled when my eyes fell upon the device. Who has been in my space?

I scanned the vicinity for movement, as if the owner of the cell phone might still be around. Perhaps it had slipped from their pocket and they‚Äôd be trekking back to find it any moment. But a feeling in the pit of my stomach told me that wasn‚Äôt the case. The phone sat there too perfectly, resting on a boulder in the middle of the clearing.

As if it had been intentionally placed.

I didn‚Äôt think twice about picking it up and looking through it. I knew I should‚Äôve ignored it, left the area, kept my nose in my own business. But, well, you see, I‚Äôve got a little problem with that. I‚Äôm a bit of a voyeur. I like to snoop. Most of my quiet places are selected for their vantage. I take binoculars and spy on people. It gives me a sense of power.

I know, I know, it‚Äôs messed up. But totally, completely harmless. Whose curiosity doesn‚Äôt get the better of them from time to time?

To my surprise, the phone was unlocked. I swiped up on the screen and saw the collection of apps, web browser, camera, notes. Curiously, there weren‚Äôt any social media apps, no dating apps, nothing that wasn‚Äôt already loaded onto a phone out the box. Like it was brand new.

My interest piqued, I opened the camera first and saw hundreds of photos organized into several different albums. I went to the first and flipped through them. They were all one woman, dark hair, green eyes, pretty in a mousy sort of way. But in none of them was she posing for the camera. In each, it seemed like she had no idea someone was snapping shots of her. There were pics of her at an art museum, walking down the sidewalk, eating at a local taco joint‚Äî

I gasped when I got to the final shots. There were dozens of them, all of her sleeping soundly in her bed. What sort of creep takes so many shots of a person sleeping? I checked out the other photo albums to find each was a repetition of the same pattern. A girl going about her day, then sleeping in her bedroom alone.

But she wasn‚Äôt really alone, was she?

With trembling hands, I closed the photo app and opened notes. I don‚Äôt know what I expected. Perhaps I hoped there would be some reasonable explanation for the pictures I‚Äôd seen, an artist‚Äôs statement about a postmodern photo project. ‚ÄúSurveillance in the Modern Era‚Äù or something.

Instead, there were detailed descriptions of five different murders. It was like reading a police report, but with extra commentary. The author of the notes would list all the places he stuck his knife, but then also how delightful the resulting screams had been. He timed each killing, from the moment of the first stab to the second he witnessed the life fade from their eyes.

A shiver ran the length of my spine. Gooseflesh broke out across my forearms. What was I reading? This couldn‚Äôt be real, could it? It had to be some sort of depraved, elaborate prank. Right?

Against my better judgment, I took the phone home with me. That night, I conducted my investigation. Sure enough, each woman in the phone corresponded to a missing persons case. I was able to match each face to a picture posted on local news sites. In all five, the body was never found. No evidence of foul play, suicide not ruled out.

Could I really be in possession of a serial killer‚Äôs phone? That question gave rise to a more disturbing follow up: how had this person been so careless with such damning evidence?

I should have reported it as soon as I pieced together what I had. I should have turned the phone over to authorities so that they might use it to find the sick person who owned it. But as days passed, I wrestled with the decision. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that they hadn‚Äôt been careless, that the lost phone wasn‚Äôt really all that lost.

Which meant two things. First, that the presumed killer probably covered their tracks pretty damn well. Even if I handed over this phone to police, it seemed unlikely to me it would lead to an arrest. Or worse, they would make an arrest, but it would be my wrists they slap the cuffs on. Because I could find no personal identifying information anywhere on the phone. It seemed to be a prepay with no accounts logged in. A perfect burner. In lieu of any better suspects, the cops would logically turn their eye to me.

The second thing was that I was meant to find it. That the killer wanted me to have this phone and knew just where to put it so that I would find it and no one else would.

That possibility occupied my thoughts for days as I struggled to ascertain the reason. Why share this information? Why share it with me? What had I done to merit their trust?

Then it rang.

An unknown caller ID flashed on the screen as I lay in bed reading. I froze, staring at the phone until the call went to voicemail. Then I stared for another half hour, waiting for the notification a voicemail was left. But the caller chose not to leave one. Was it the killer trying to contact me? Verify that I‚Äôd put two and two together? Did they know I had the phone still? Were the watching me?

The call happened again the next night, and the next night after that. For five days in a row, I watched in horrified silence as ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù blared on the screen, each time too petrified to answer. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Should I have picked up? Told the person they were evil, that they should stop what they were doing? That would make me crazier than they were.

Last night, instead of calling, they sent a text. It read: ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre seeing this.‚Äù

A second text came five minutes after the first. It contained a picture of a blonde sipping her latte at the coffee shop just down the street from my apartment complex.

I shut the phone off, but I haven‚Äôt gotten rid of it. Right now, it sits at the bottom of my sock drawer like a terrible secret.

And every waking moment, I think about responding.

It's so distracting whenever I'm jogging but I need to have my glasses on to be able to SEE.

I fucking hate how whenever I have to look down for long periods of time like writing, reading or taking an exam it gradually starts to slip off and you need to constantly adjust it.

I fucking hate how much steam and fog gets up all in your glasses. I cook a lot and I also enjoy making hot drinks like hot milk or chocolate and I seriously hate having to wipe my glasses constantly every fucking 60 seconds when I'm just cooking my everyday breakfast. I hate how when I drink a nice cup of coffee it steams up my glasses and I have to wipe it everytime. Alternative solution is to take it off first then put it back on after. Both are super annoying and tedious.

I fucking hate how wearing my glasses for more than a few hours give me an insane fucking headache. I can't binge anything like I used to because of this shit unless I take Ibuprofen. I want to read a book or binge a show the entire day but I fucking CANT because I need to take long breaks otherwise it hurts having my glasses on for too long.

I fucking hate how glasses look on me. I used to think made me look cute, quirky, whatever. These days I look in the mirror and all I see is a fucking dork. I take it off and my face immediately becomes 10x more attractive. I've tried multiple frames (I own 7) and none of them look good on me.

I fucking hate how much you need to pay for this shit especially when your eyesight gradually gets worse so you need to constantly get new lenses. 

I fucking hate how I need to worry about protecting my glasses when I'm playing any sport.

I fucking hate how you need to bring it to your optician constantly to do maintainance on your frames otherwise the screws loosen up and the lenses start popping off. On one occasion I was inside my car and as I was putting on my glasses the left lense popped off out of nowhere and it got lost so I had to drive with one eye shut. 

And no, contacts don't help. If anything it makes it worse. God, I just want to get eye surgery already but I'm not of that age yet to be able to legally take it. 

As someone who's been wearing glasses for most of their life, I really do appreciate the opportunity to see without being forced to do eye surgery or use contact lenses but they can be INCREDIBLY infuriating sometimes, most of the time. I'm sick and tired of it at this point.",2,1735402900.0,Vent,2,0.67,False

1ho8yvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cd_collectors/comments/1ho8yvt/starting_a_free_cd_media_library/,Starting a Free CD/ media Library,"I had an idea to create a free disc library, similar to take-a-book, leave-a-book shelves. People can donate their old CDs and vinyl, drop off their zines and radical literature, and it would create a more accessible way to shop records for our low income folks. 

I would start by opening 1 or 2 shelves and brand them as locations for West Sound Records, my independent punk label I've been running for a few years. Ideally I would place them in the front lobbies of small music venues, coffee shops, or even just standalone covered cabinets. Each shelf would be recovered from a local thrift store and independent artists would volunteer to paint and decorate them. 

After a while I want to test selling my label CDs on an honor system. I would build a distinctively seperate CD rack stocked with label releases and signage with venmo instructions. I know there are places where this system could work, but I imagine theft would be an issue in other areas. I also want a local shelf where any band can stock their CDs and recieve 100% of their venmo sales. Again, risk of theft, but there are certainly trusted places where small bands would benefit from passive merch sales.

Anyways, let me know what you guys think. Have you ever seen a setup like this for music? Would you shop/ donate from a mini record store?",5,1735402711.0,Cd_collectors,3,0.86,False

**Trip Report:**  
**Multiple trips throughout New England and into Maryland**  
**December 22 - 27, 2024**  
2024 Kona EV (Limited Trim)64.8-kWh battery  
Winter snow tires inflated to 36 PSI  
Outdoor temperatures ranging from below 5F to 35F (large periods of time below 20F)  
Trips (mostly) planned with the ABRP app with the individual stops sent to Waze.  
Average range for the entire trip outlined below was 2.8 miles/kWh  
Average fair weather range has been approximately 3.5 miles/kWh¬†

**Trip 1**  
**Sunday December 22, 2024**  
**Vermont to Connecticut**  
**276 Miles**  
This trip, during ideal conditions, would require one stop just past the halfway mark (we begin the trip charged to 100% from our home charger). The trip is driven nearly exclusively on Interstate roads at an average speed of 72 mph. Conditions were post snowstorm with the roads clear but still very sloppy. We lost a few of our cameras due to being covered by road sludge. This impacted the cruise control and lane assist toward the end of the trip. Given the low temps, we required two stops. Both had chargers immediately available. I forgot to precondition the battery for the first leg, so the first stop took longer than it should.

For the second leg, we preconditioned the battery at 20 minutes out from the stop. I didn‚Äôt get the indicator that the battery had finished preconditioning, but the charging curve on the second charge topped out above 70KW for a few minutes. We charged at a rate in the high 40s for most of the stop (approximately 45 minutes). There was a Goodwill within walking distance from this stop (Ford dealer), and I love a good thrift. I bought 7 neckties of modern design for $3 each. My wife bought a new pair of stylish rain boots.

We arrived at my brother‚Äôs house in CT. The plan was to charge the Kona on Level 1 from his outdoor outlets overnight and leave for our next trip in the morning with whatever we managed to acquire, but the car kept blowing his fuses. He assures me he‚Äôll be installing a level 2 at his house.

We learned that the infrastructure in CT is absolutely dreadful and we didn‚Äôt want to get stranded on the first leg of our trip the next day. I opted to drive 25 minutes away to a Hyundai dealership and take the charge to 80% while my wife caught up with my brother‚Äôs family. This was frustrating. Approximately 120 minutes of total charge time (with the preconditioning error).

**Trip 2**  
**Monday December 23, 2024**  
**Connecticut to Baltimore**  
**280 Miles**  
ABRP planned two stops for us, but we didn‚Äôt necessarily trust the calculations. We left CT at 6:15am to hopefully get to Baltimore as early as possible to maximize time with my daughter. The charger I had used the night prior (Hyundai dealership) was actually on the way, and I had already dropped to 70% the night prior driving back to my brother‚Äôs home (it was, quite literally, the only charger that I could find within half an hour from my brother‚Äôs house). We stopped there again to give ourselves a safety buffer.

On this day, our first charger was actually located at a service area right off the interstate. We had a great charging curve, again topping off around 75KW, and grabbed a coffee and breakfast sandwich from Dunkin. Temps were still around 10F, so we had preconditioned 30 minutes out from the charger and had received the notification that preconditioning had completed just a few miles from the charger. This would be the only highpoint of the day.

This trip really highlighted the poor infrastructure that needs to catch up for EV drivers on long trips. Traveling through that poor infrastructure, on one of the most crowded travel days of the year, was an absolute shit show. Our first stop was scheduled to be at a Walmart with 10 chargers (1 of which was not operating). The location is approximately 3 miles from the interstate. When we arrived, we found that we would have been the 8th car in the queue. Even if you factor that each car would have waited an additional 10 minutes (a very liberal estimate), that would have added 80 minutes to the trip. Instead, we used the Hyundai navigation system to find the closest charger and ended up traveling, first, to a Holiday Inn. We couldn‚Äôt get that charger (Electrify America) to connect (it looked very neglected) and then found a Hyundai dealership a few miles away. When we arrived, their one charger was being used by the dealership and they seemed surprised to have a road tripper arrive to request its use. Nonetheless, they happily disconnected their car and asked us a few questions about our road trip from Vermont as we were charging.

ABRP then suggested a WaWa station for our final stop that would get us to Baltimore with a 15% state of charge. We would have been the 6th car in the queue and decided, again, not to wait. Instead, the Hyundai navigation system offered another gas station within range and we arrived there with no wait. Here, we took it to 80% and prepared for our final leg of the drive.

What should have taken 6 hours max on a crowded travel day ended up taking us 9 hours. We arrived in Baltimore just past 3pm. We checked into our hotel, grabbed a quick shower, and then our son-in-law picked us up in their ICE vehicle to drive us down to DC for a show at the Kennedy Center. This was an incredibly frustrating day of travel and, speaking frankly, it was nice to rely on a car that had a full tank and another driver. We had a great dinner and show in DC. Approximately 120 minutes of total charge time. Additional drive time resulting from full charging stations.

**Tuesday December 24, 2024**  
**Remain in Baltimore**¬†  
**Moderate usage and charge for our next trip**  
In Baltimore, we searched for a charger that would allow us to park while walking around an area of the city. We could only find a parking garage with very slow first generation chargers. While we shopped, we drew a pathetic 7KW at max and only gained a few percentage points for our state of charge. We searched and searched for other chargers in other parts of the city but only found a grocery store with both chargers occupied. We did our shopping (I picked up two 45 records signed by John Waters from his favorite local bookshop and a really funky scarf at one of my favorite thrift stores in Baltimore) without adding to the charge.

We found a free public charger within a few blocks of the restaurant where we were going to have dinner, but couldn‚Äôt get it to connect. We even called the number on the machine and spent some time troubleshooting with the tech team that answered. No luck. We ultimately decided to head to a high speed charger near a Target in an area of the city we had not planned to visit. We bought road trip snacks and our daughter bought a few things for her trip the following day. We only had a 5 minute wait at this bank of chargers and took it to 80% while we walked across the street to Target. Approximately 45 minutes of total charge time (not counting the parking garage).

**Trip 3**  
**Wednesday December 25, 2024**  
**Baltimore to Connecticut**  
**280 Miles**  
We left Baltimore early. This trip was the opposite experience from the 23rd. Roads were predictably empty and the same stops (WaWa and Walmart) that were suggested to us for the December 23rd trip were now immediately available. Our charging curve never went beyond the high 50s (even with well timed preconditioning), but it was nice to sit and chill without the stress of scrambling to find an alternate charging location. We topped off our charge at the Hyundai dealership that is closest to my brother‚Äôs house and had a nice afternoon and evening with my brother‚Äôs family and my parents who live nearby. Approximately 120 minutes of total charge time.

**Trip 4**  
**Thursday December 26, 2024**  
**Short trip to a train to NYC**  
**Moderate mileage**  
We drove to a commuter train station that is in the same town as the Hyundai dealership where we‚Äôve been charging while staying at my brother‚Äôs. We took the train into the city and met my second daughter and her wife‚Äôs family to take in an exhibit and dinner. I highly recommend the Luna Luna exhibit currently at The Shed in NYC if you‚Äôre at all interested in 80s pop artists (Haring, Basquiat, Liechtenstein, etc.). As we were traveling to the city, my wife saw an Instagram post from The Drama Book Shop near Grand Central Station indicating that Lin Manuel Miranda had just stopped in and signed a bunch of items. By the time we arrived, many of the items had already sold, but we were able to purchase two signed copies of the vinyl for his new show in development (a Broadway production of The Warriors movie) ‚Äì one for me, one for my brother ‚Äì and a signed tote bag.

After the return train, we topped off again at the Hyundai dealership in order to leave with a 70% charge for our return to Vermont. The train arrived back to CT early, so our preconditioning via the app did not have enough time to prepare the battery, resulting in a slower than hoped for charging session.

**Trip 5**  
**Friday December 27, 2024**  
**Connecticut to Vermont**  
**256 Miles**  
We took a different route home than the route we took from VT to CT. The route is more direct, but less interstate. This was a gorgeous drive primarily on 2 lane roads with two charging stops. Both charging stops were uneventful with no wait. Approximately 90 minutes of total charge time.

**Takeaways:**  
The travels from CT to Baltimore on December 23rd really highlight how much the infrastructure needs to catch up for maximum usage. On a large travel day, even the small minority of EV drivers were very much competing for the available chargers.

We live in VT with a clear commitment to prioritizing the infrastructure. My local electrical provider (municipality owned) offered significant incentives for setting up a home charger and offer outstanding rates to charge during off-peak hours. Outside of this sort of road trip, I‚Äôm paying 3 cents per mile to drive. My home charger cost me $200 out of pocket to set up.

Connecticut offers an example of how far behind the state is falling by not prioritizing the infrastructure or incentivizing home chargers. We estimate it will cost my brother as much as $1500 - $2000 to set up a home charger. The woefully inadequate charging infrastructure will become exponentially problematic as more and more people convert to EVs.

The NJ turnpike is reportedly actively working toward providing adequate charging stations every 30 miles at service areas. This will be critical for these sorts of trips in order to avoid the need for traveling miles off course to get to a Walmart parking lot just to find a large queue on heavy travel days.

I‚Äôm personally willing to accommodate two or three 45 minute charging sessions for these sorts of winter trips. The trip from VT to CT would be one 45 minute charging session during moderate and summer weather trips. I would not do the CT to Baltimore trip again until the infrastructure improves.

I‚Äôll add to and conversation that develops within the tread and answer any questions I can for a few days.",1,1735402620.0,KonaEV,2,1.0,False

Tried 4 different ones. And the 4th seemed right, but later on I couldn't quit smoking, i was feeling depressed and passive. So they wanted to prescribe me Zyban (Wellbutrin/Bupropion) An anti depressant that can help to quit smoking and help with ADHD.
I had to quit my adhd meds for 2 weeks before i could start the new medication.


In those two weeks most, if not all, of my issues went away.
I think the adhd medication was making me feel depressed and i was coping by smoking cigarettes.


In the beginning my meds helped me get stuff done. But for the past year I didn't cook, barely went for walks and rarely did any of my hobbies. I was feeling more and more depressed. And increasingly frustrated with my inability to do the things I wanted to do. 
Im perplexed that quitting my medication gave me the results that I was taking the medication for.


Worth mentioning that in the last nine months i quit smoking green (ex daily smoker) quit drinking, quit coffee and now quit smoking a few weeks ago. Im fully raw dogging it lol and i dont remember the last time I felt this good. I'm messy and chaotic, but I can deal with it. At least I'm finally able to do the things I enjoy again. I do lego. I even read part of a book the other day! I'm so relieved I could cry. I'm cooking elaborate shit almost daily, it's such a joy.


Not sure what I'm trying to achieve with putting this out here. just wanted to share and maybe hear others' experiences",0,1735402419.0,ADHD,4,0.5,False
