I just bought the Nespresso essenza mini and have used Lavazza pods and so far, it’s better than my Aeropress and doesn’t waste as much coffee. I make a double shot of espresso (2 capsules) and add hot milk to it to make my American-styled coffee. Any recommendations for coffee pods other than Lavazza?

Partnering that with my trusty Lelit Anna with PID, I’ve been dialing in Vienna Roast and tackling Attikan Estate beans. Temperature control and grind settings have become my morning rituals—because what’s coffee without a little precision science, right?

Anyone else gone through the grinder struggle to find that perfect brew? Let’s talk wins, fails, and everything in between!

I believe the Pioneer does actually drink coffee ('clink' sound and never-emptying cup and helmet be damned). But how?

Dimensional Tech and Production Amplification!

First, when the Pioneer lifts cup to helmet, coffee goes from cup to mouth via Dimensional teleportation. Nothing fancy about this.

Second, when the above drinking is done, the coffee output from cup is doubled. This results in the amount of coffee in the cup staying the same (whatever you drink is replaced in the cup).

There are certainly plotholes/questions (gee, is your cup a mini coffee factory then?) but that's what I believe, I don't care - I love my coffee and *I will absolutely choose to have my coffee and drink it too*.",2,1728381447.0,SatisfactoryGame,1,1.0,False

I've always been a good sleeper, usually a solid 8-8.5 hrs, but the past few months I'm waking up around the normal time feeling not rested at all. Even though I'm tired during the day, I don't find it easier to go to sleep at night.

I would say 1-2 days a week I wake up around 4am and don't go back to sleep. The other days, I think I might be waking up around a similar time and going back to sleep but not getting quality sleep the rest of the night.

Some nights I can feel light pressure in my gut around this time, a feeling like I need to fart, but like the fart ain't coming for awhile. I might fart a couple small farts too. 

There's been no change to my diet that I can think of. I eat dinner around 5-6pm and then fast until around 11am the next day (not counting morning coffee).

Is there something I can do to conclude my sleep and the gut thing are connected? How do I solve this?

I’ve (25, F) recently started as an intern with a company and they always go for coffee in the morning. I usually go with them when I don’t have meetings because it’s good for networking and talking to other people. Usually, someone always pays for everyone’s coffee. I had offered to pay on multiple occasions, or asked if they’re sure that they want to pay for mine as well, but they always insist that it’s fine. I’ve paid myself for everyone’s coffee at times as well. 

Recently, one of my managers wanted to take me out for coffee and other colleagues came as well. I wasn’t particularly paying attention to the conversation and he turned to me stating that I never pay with all the money I’ve been earning since starting as an intern. I told him that I recently paid and an other colleague told him that as well.

He probably meant it as a bad joke, but I felt really put on the spot and embarrassed. Compared to them, in a year I earn around 15K, and my colleagues’ salary ranges from 60-100k a year. I might have not paid enough for coffees in the beginning since I was new and everyone kept paying before I could offer, and I did insist on whether it was okay with them, and try to pay myself when I can. It can get quite expensive paying often for everyone’s coffee, considering that I don’t earn half what they do, and I need to pay rent and other daily expenses on my own.

I feel guilty and it’s been on my mind for days. I don’t want to seem cheap. As an intern, should I pay more often? Should I just not go for coffee anymore with them? ",1,1728380613.0,LifeAdvice,2,1.0,False

1fyvtpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1fyvtpn/what_do_you_think_of_this_story_opening/,What do you think of this story opening?,"Aurelia took a deep breath as the Uber crawled to a stop. In front of her was a large brass gate, opened to reveal a cobblestone driveway that was at least a quarter of a mile long.

“Wow, it’s beautiful.” Noemi was sitting next to her, looking up from her phone for the first time since they left the airport. The photos and videos that Aurelia had seen of The Complex didn’t do it justice.

She could only see one building, but it was essentially a mansion, white and airy with big windows and chandeliers and a well kept garden outside.

Aurelia hopped out of the Uber and waited for the driver to open the trunk, which held five large suitcases.

Noemi followed behind her, taking her three bags, while Aurelia put on her backpack and took her own two.

The car drove off, and they could see a young looking woman driving up the path on a golf cart. She was neatly dressed in a pair of black leggings and a Complex jacket.

“Welcome!” The woman said. Up close she looked older than she had at first. She was probably in her 40s. “I’m Waverly, the director of the school. I oversee living arrangements, academics, and anything else you may need help with.”

“I’m Noemi White.” She smiled brightly. “And this is my sister, Aurelia.”

“So nice to meet you, Noemi!” Waverly exclaimed. “I’m so glad you could come.” She shook Noemi’s hand. As an afterthought, she shook Aurelia’s as well. “And you too, Aurelia. A pleasure. I’m sure you’ll do great things.” 

Aurelia was used to instances like this. Everyone seemed to be happier to meet Noemi than her. It used to bother her, but she was used to it by now. Aurelia has spent her entire life living in the shadow of her older sister, the former Broadway star.

Waverly motioned towards the golf cart. “Feel free to put everything in here,” she said. “I’ll give you a ride to the main building, and we can begin our tour before you start to get settled in.”

It took some maneuvering and adjusting, but within five minutes all three of them and all five of the suitcases were on the golf cart. They slowly made their way towards the main building, the one that resembled a castle.

“So this is the main building. You’ll hear most people refer to it as ‘main’ or ‘central,’” Waverly began. It was clear from her tone and confidence that this wasn’t the first time she’d given this tour. She put the golf cart in park outside of a side door, where a row of other, identical golf carts rested. “In here are the offices, the stage, and the dining room. Follow me.” Waverly led them to the front door. A small bell chimed when she opened it.

The inside of the building was just as beautiful as the outside. Everything was modern and gorgeous, from the white marble staircase to the picturesque chandelier.

“It’s quiet right now because everyone’s in class. Usually, students have the freedom to come here to get help, talk with the counselors, or practice. This is the lounge.”

She pulled open the first door on the right, revealing a spacious room with a variety of furniture, a stocked fridge, coffee counter, and bookshelf, a television, and a few desks. It was like a library, game room, and snack bar all in one.

On her second look around the room, Aurelia noticed that there was someone sitting on the beanbag chair in the corner. The girl looked to be about her age, and she was sipping something from a mug while flipping through a copy of Seventeen magazine.

“Gianova!” Waverly exclaimed. “Why aren’t you in class?”

But we haven't had the space. Our microwave is broken and it looks like it might be around £100 to fix it, so I wondered if we mightn't as well just get an air fryer instead, especially as many of them are included in Amazon's Prime Big Deal offers today. 

We primarily used the microwave for reheating food, or occasionally making popcorn, both of which I know you can do in an air fryer. (Popcorn, of course, would have to be made from kernels rather than those instant packets, but still quicker and less terrifying than in a pan on a hob.) 

The only thing I can think we wouldn't be able to do is reheat a coffee, but that hasn't really been an issue for the month we've had no microwave so far. Is there something I'm missing here that we'll realised after we've bought it and kick ourself for getting rid of the microwave? ",2,1728379756.0,airfryer,3,1.0,False

1. do nothing for 6 months
2. prescribe Levothyroxine 50mg (3-4 months)
3. take me off it for 3-4 months
4. prescribe the same dosage again (currently 2nd month)

Context: 
no symptoms, mild thyroid gland deformity but nothing serious (the dr said), pineal gland is fine.
Diagnosed accidentally while doing a Bloods Test for something else, had a stressful 2yr period prior to that…
I exercise and try to eat balanced (fruits and nuts for breakfast, meat and rice/potato + salad for lunch, junk food twice a week, sugary food daily usually after lunch, coffee and lemon water once a day)
Significantly reduced the stress in my life the past year, but no changes in tsh (multiple tests done within 1yr, showing tsh between 24 and 30!)

SIBO test was negative.. could it still be SIBO based on the symptoms?","So my diet nowadays is very similar to keto but with the addition of some carbs in the form of bread, or pizza dough or pitta breads that I make myself. I hardly ever eat carbs based food I ate somewhere else.

So I skip breakfast just black coffee or green tea.

Lunch is some form of salad that includes tomato, lettuce, pepper, cucumber, cabbage, beans or lentils (in water only and rinsed out thoroughly which makes them practically gas free), usually 2 eggs or other meat for protein, some roasted beef, cheese\* almonds, hazelnuts, gherkins. Sometimes I add flaxseed for extra fibre but usually I eat stuff with a lot of fibre in it. I don't eat bread every day maybe 1-2 a week. My dinners may have some carbs in the form of breaded chicken but usually it's cooked meat/fish with salad again. I also eat as a 'sweet' 90% cocoa chocolate which usually has less than 10% sugar. I take probiotics 10-30 minutes before lunch usually. I've tried many types for months at a time with very little noticeable progress.

\*Cheese - I'm lactose intolerant so I manage it very very carefully with lactase tablets regardless what I'm eating. I usually eat blue stilton, leerdammer(lactose free although it doesn't say on the packaging), lactose free cheddar, lactose free yogurt. I also eat a lot of alpro vegan yogurts for added probiotics and sometimes sauerkraut.

So my bowel movement usually kicks in the morning and it's like the bottom part feels solid to the point where I feel constipated but what comes at the end is a lot softer in consistency..this happens when I eat something with sugar, usually alpro yogurts or some kind of vegan dessert to avoid milk entirely.

A practical example was Saturday night I ate a burger and chips at a pub with some wine, Sunday afternoon bowel movement was painful as I was almost entirely constipated.. no dessert of any kind on Saturday. Sunday evening I ate a vegan apple crumble and this morning had the same ye olde soft consistency bowel movement which again started as solid coming out but the end is soft. Very little bowel motility as well and I take a lot of ginger in supplements.

I have magnesium in supplements but it's byglycinate and it doesn't affect me at all bower movement wise. Other supplements are magnesium free.

I don't drink any soft drinks. Sweeteners give me diarrhea

The only thing I currently eat (sometimes) that affects me adversely is sugar.. what could it be?

SIBO test was negative. My gastrenterologist said I don't know and told me to see a dietician.. I asked him about stool samples he said there is nothing he can do. I'm thinking I need another gastrenterologist.. He asked to do a SIBO test which I had to do twice and it was negative but mostly due to the incompetence of the testing kit company so now I'm second guessing the results.

On a side note if my feet get very cold that also triggers a bowel movement.. not sure what that is about. Me walking around with no socks if the temperature is lower than 20 C or so with almost certainly send me to the toilet..",1,1728379529.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

1fyvlnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1fyvlnx/food_options_near_the_haram_share_your/,Food options near The Haram. Share your recommendations with prices!,"I am from the subcontinent, so this is directed towards us, but feel free to share your own.   
  
In Makkah our closest go-to for food was the food court on top of Hilton Suites.

Al Baik, of course, is a crowd magnet, but we found it less busy around certain times: early morning when they open (around 10-11 am), in the late afternoon (around 4-5 pm), and again after midnight (1-2 am). However, keep in mind, the Al Baik outlets around the Haram only serve nuggets and sandwiches, no broast. A 7-piece nuggets meal costs 15 SAR.

Slightly overrated. Don't fall for the hype. If it's easily accessible, go for it. If it's hella crowded, don't waste hours standing in a line. 

We tried the broast at Tazaj, and honestly, it didn’t impress. The food in the area can be hit or miss, and that meal was just okay, priced around 21-25 SAR. I have heard their kabsa is good. 

However, if you’re looking for something more flavorful, I’d recommend O Jeen.

For what’s available in the area, their biryani is quite decent, and their chicken curry is nice, especially if you're after something with a bit of masala. The spicy faham with rice is another solid choice. I genuinely enjoyed eating there and would recommend it.

But avoid the so-called Jalfrezi or Chicken 65 they advertise—it’s disappointing. If they call that Jalfrezi, may their ancestors cry; and if it’s supposed to be Chicken 65, then ours might cry too!

Their chicken curry is 15 SAR (enough for two people), the spicy faham with rice is 28 SAR (also feeds two), and the flavored rice is just 10 SAR (serves 2-3).

If you’re craving pizza or cheesecake, there’s a store nearby on the same floor with pretty good cheesecake for only 10 SAR. Be cautious, though, because other shops on the same floor sell similar items for 20 SAR.

There’s also a shawarmat and Shawarmer stall right when you get up to the floor, and I recommend telling them to make you a new one so that you don't get duped by a cold readymade default. 

If you’re a coffee lover, Camel Step is a great spot. It's in the basement of the building, and their coffee of the day is just 10 SAR. Definitely worth a visit.

If you're staying along Ibrahim Khaleel Road, near VOCO, you’ll find plenty of Pakistani and Indian restaurants walking to and fro The Haram.

Now, if the Clock Tower is closest to you, head up to Safwah Tower. Instead of stopping at the first food place you see. Wander around a bit; you'll find some good curries and karahis, and the prices are relatively cheaper up there.

As for Romansiah? That place used to be great, but now it's a complete letdown. I feel scammed, and the rage I'm still processing is unreal. I'll just leave it at that. I've had it in Jabal Omar and Aziziyah. Not worth a visit. ",1,1728379204.0,islam,0,1.0,False

Caffeine agitates the mind and nervous system. My friend had wd after taking a cup of coffee after quitting for so long while on retention. 

I quit caffeine in every shape or form 2+ years ago and I always get comment of how calm my energy is. On the other hand my flatmate used to verbally attack me for being ""slow brain"" he is a sugar,coffee,nicotine addict. He lives on those things only. And that is really sad and i wish him well. 

 That solidified my commitment to avoid caffeine forever. I also meditate 20 min per day, walk at the park and be present in the moment. Avoid onion and garlic when lever i can. Definitely avoid spicy food it brings anger and attachment to the material world. 

I am homosexual and was banned for 30 days because I mentioned that in my post. I also was attacked by the friend I mentioned in the beginning because I mentioned that to him as Well. 

The truth i have good level of self mastery when it comes to semen retention. I acknowledge that it is easier for me than a heterosexual man to retain because I'm not aroused by a women, and men don't arouse me the way women does to heterosexual men. 

I do have sex and ingest semen a lot while refraining from ejaculation. And that really energizes me and i ask for the person's consent that i will do that and that this will drain them energetically and they still agree to do it. So I'm not deceiving anybody. 

I'm grateful for the motivation I got from you all. But I don't think Semen retention should be a competition or exclusive to heterosexual men( i know not everyone think that). I don't feel the need to try to conceal my sexuality so some people can feel safe. I'm doing really great job and built a lot of good daily habits and I'm grateful for all the love and support from God❤️

1fyvfmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1fyvfmt/minimalist_home_decor_achieving_simplicity_and/,Minimalist Home Decor: Achieving Simplicity and Elegance,"In a world filled with distractions and clutter, the concept of minimalist home decor has gained immense popularity. Minimalism isn't just about having fewer things—it's about creating a space that feels calm, functional, and stylish by focusing on the essentials. Achieving simplicity and elegance in your home requires a careful balance of design elements that work together to create an uncluttered, serene environment. Here’s how you can embrace minimalist decor while maintaining sophistication.

**1. Start with a Neutral Palette**

One of the hallmarks of minimalist home decor is a neutral color scheme. Shades like white, beige, gray, and soft pastels help create a calming, open atmosphere. Neutral colors allow you to layer in textures and accents without overwhelming the space. By sticking to a muted palette, you can make the most of natural light and highlight the simplicity that defines minimalism.

**2. Choose Simple Yet Stylish Furniture**

Furniture in a minimalist home should be functional, streamlined, and free of unnecessary details. Opt for clean-lined sofas, tables, and chairs with a focus on quality over quantity. Select pieces that serve multiple purposes, like an ottoman that doubles as storage or a sleek console table that can also act as a workspace. [Rugs Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) with subtle textures or monochrome designs can add warmth and comfort without overpowering the minimalist aesthetic. Look for rugs that are simple in design, yet elegant enough to enhance the space.

**3. Incorporate Thoughtful Lighting**

Lighting plays a key role in minimalist decor by shaping the mood of a room. Avoid overly ornate fixtures and instead opt for clean, modern designs that contribute to the overall simplicity of the space. [Hanging ceiling lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) are an excellent option for minimalist homes, offering elegance and function in one. Choose lights with sleek, geometric designs or simple, industrial finishes to complement the minimalist theme. For example, a minimalist pendant light with a metal frame or a glass globe can provide a striking yet understated focal point in any room.

Incorporating different layers of lighting will elevate your minimalist home. In addition to overhead lighting, [floor lamps in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/floor-lamps) are perfect for adding warmth and ambiance. Select floor lamps with slim, simple bases and neutral shades to maintain the clean aesthetic while also providing necessary task or accent lighting.

**4. Embrace Negative Space**

One of the key principles of minimalism is embracing negative space. This means leaving some areas of your home deliberately uncluttered, allowing the room to breathe and creating a sense of openness. Instead of filling every corner with furniture or decor, focus on a few key pieces that enhance the room without overcrowding it.

For instance, in the living room, you can use a simple, modern rug from Dubai to ground the space while keeping furniture minimal. A large floor rug with a neutral tone adds texture and warmth but maintains the minimalist design philosophy of ""less is more."" This approach ensures that each item in your home has a purpose and contributes to the overall harmony of the space.

**5. Add Elegant Accents in Small Doses**

Minimalist decor doesn't mean you have to strip away all personality. It's about selecting the right decorative pieces that complement the overall aesthetic without causing clutter. Use accents sparingly—think a single large vase, a carefully chosen piece of artwork, or a minimalist clock.

When choosing accessories, look for items with clean lines and simple materials like metal, wood, or stone. Soft furnishings such as throw pillows or blankets can be in neutral shades or soft patterns to maintain the minimalist vibe.

**6. Focus on Natural Materials and Textures**

A minimalist home thrives on natural materials, which bring warmth and texture to a space that might otherwise feel stark. Wood, stone, glass, and natural fibers help add depth and dimension without overwhelming the room. For instance, a wooden coffee table with a raw, natural finish pairs beautifully with soft woolen rugs in Dubai, adding warmth and comfort to a minimalist living room.

Use simple greenery to bring life into your minimalist home. A few carefully placed plants in elegant pots can provide the perfect pop of color and a sense of serenity.

**Conclusion**

Achieving simplicity and elegance through minimalist decor is about focusing on the essentials while maintaining a sense of warmth and personality. By incorporating clean-lined furniture, neutral colors, and carefully selected accents like hanging ceiling lights, floor lamps in Dubai, and stylish rugs in Dubai, you can create a home that feels calm, inviting, and timeless. Minimalism is more than just a design trend—it’s a lifestyle that brings clarity and balance to your living spaces.",1,1728378420.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Could be a breakfast, lunch, snack, whatever. As someone who really LOVES food, I find that having some “autopilot” food that just is what it is every day helps me to not think about it, eases decision fatigue, and allows me to save creativity and calories for food I really enjoy at dinner.

Mine is breakfast - every morning, I make a half volume (extra thick) whey and almond ‘shake’ and use it as creamer between a few cups of coffee/tea, plus a bottled yogurt protein drink and about 60g blueberries.

335 calories: 46g protein, 27g carbs, 4g fat. 

Strong protein base layer for the day, and I find the blueberries give just enough carbs to keep me from getting nauseous from all the protein.

My husband does 99.9% of looking after him and it’s not a biased opinion. He takes him meals daily or takes him out to eat to make sure he has eaten because he forgets. His memory is bad and he really can’t care for himself well but his mind is still there enough to be able to say no to getting extra outside help or to move into a place where they would be more hands on with him but not a nursing home. At least he is in an apartment in a building with other seniors and there are a few neighbours there who have offered to do things like some laundry and check in on him. Because they see my husband there often. They know he works nights. They know I work full time and can’t always be there to do stuff. And they know how often they see his daughter. Even the rest of my in-laws see how much my husband is doing for him. And she doesn’t seem to care. She very nicely informed us she has well over 100 days of paid sick time just sitting waiting to be used that she could use to take him to some of his appointments or take him to eat or go grocery shopping. But nope, she never thinks beyond herself. She gets to go and have fun doing things with her friends and her husband and their older teen kids and doesn’t spend one iota on energy worrying about her dad. All she is worried about is what she and her children will inherit from him. She will show up and sparkle and shine at his funeral, looking nicely made up in a nice outfit and make a nice speech about him. As well she doesn’t do anything for her brother (my husband’s) birthday anymore. Since their mom passed away she has never asked him to come over to celebrate his birthday like they used to. I have offered to host people at our house but my husband always says our house is too small to have a group of people over. And it is. But even just for cake and coffee for a few hours would be nice. He always gives her kids nice gifts and her too, though lately he has stopped giving her gifts and just gives things to her teen kids. But like last year was a milestone birthday for him and it seemed largely ignored by his family when we got together with them Christmas Eve. There was zero mention of it. I have tried speaking up before but they all manage to ignore me pretty well too. As it stands now we generally see them Thanksgiving and Christmas, for the past few years she hasn’t even invited us (including her dad) to celebrate her kid’s birthdays as a family gathering. Part of me wishes so hard that dad’s aging needs were strictly physical and that he still had his mind about him so he could see and understand how his daughter has essentially abandoned him. I think he does realize it in his own way, it’s just too bad he can’t express it to her. And he has always been so good to her and her kids. He spoiled her rotten and then the kids. When he was more capable he was always over there, playing with them, taking them out, buying them things, and now this is how she repays him. He does have another son older than my husband but he lives in another city and is busy with his career and his family but he does at least make good efforts to come to see his dad. They had planned on taking dad out to stay with him for a number of weeks but dad got sick and was in the hospital and couldn’t go. But older son was still able to get here for over a week taking time off work. He sat all day in the hospital with him and told my husband to spend some time at home. I just hate watching this happen. It sucks watching someone make so much effort and someone else just going along with their head in the sand about what is happening to their parent. Also this is important to add, my husband has done more than his share of helping his dad get cleaned up after having bathroom accidents that are massive. So yeah I just needed somewhere else to talk about this because it just drives me crazy",0,1728378294.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

1fyve5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/pericarditis/comments/1fyve5l/pericarditis_and_nsaids_allergy/,Pericarditis and NSAID's allergy ,"This will be more of a rant/my story but if anyone have any advice for a new comer I'm all ears. 

So I've known for at least the last 10ish years that NSAID's are not good for me (not entirely sure if it's an actual allergy) and I honestly thought that was never gonna be a problem. 

Well December 2023 I go to the ER for intense chest pain they do so some tests and EKGs and conclude that I have pericarditis. They want to put me on Ibuprofen but I inform them that last time I had ibuprofen it made me have allergy like reactions (wheezing, runny nose and eyes) which probably means NSAID's in general are a no-go for me. I also told them that it should be in my chart. So the er doctor suggests that maybe we try aspirin instead, I tell them I don't feel super comfortable with that but get told by one of the personnel (a nurse I believe) that aspirin is not an NSAID(??). We go back and forth a bit because I insist that it is an NSAID. But eventually I fold out of just exhaustion and they talk me into trying a tiny dose to see if I can tolerate it. 20 or so minutes later my nose and eyes are starting to run and eventually I have to press the red button by the bed because breathing is becoming very difficult so they hit me with an epipen and a shitload of Benadryl through IV. This combo made the rest of the night a blur and I promptly passed out.

Pericarditis round 2; Last Thursday, October 3rd. I woke up had a coffee and relaxed in bed as I had the day off when I suddenly noticed my heart was beating very hard and irregular. Like palpitations that wouldn't stop and a resting heart rate at 130 when it's normally 60ish. This made me a little concerned and being that I live alone and didn't wanna risk driving I called 911. EMTs arrived and concluded that I had a strong arrythmia and abnormalities on the EKG. My BP was also very well above normal so they insisted I come with them to the ER, which I did not protest to. At the ER they did the usual tests to make sure it wasn't something else and eventually came to the conclusion that I once again have pericarditis. This time they put me on prednisone and have referred me to a cardiologist so currently I am just waiting.

The strange thing, this second time around I have noticed much pain. Now post diagnosis I have realized that I am indeed a bit sore in the chest area and it does get worse during some activity but nothing like the pain I experienced the first time which I'm thankful for but hoping this will pass 😔 

New to this and really needed to vent I guess, I already have some chronic health problems and I was really hoping to not get anymore 😮‍💨  ",1,1728378245.0,pericarditis,0,1.0,False

But I didn't do anything with Maruki.  Is it really worth it, that I play the whole game again to get this extra content I missed?","I talked to my friends about my playthrough for the first time yesterday, and they reacted like it was the end of the world that I didn't rank up Maruki and get ""the third semester"" content.

I didn't look up anything during my playthrough.  I just played the game how I naturally would based on the presentation & my own choices.  That's how I play any game.  And I chose to interact with several other characters over Maruki with the time I had.

There was no serious indication that doing this was such an important thing to do in-game.  There was a school announcement one day that Maruki will be leaving soon-- but that didn't make me want to start maxing him out by any means.  I still wanted to put my time towards other confidants instead, so that's what I did.

Now after 180 hours of gameplay and feeling good about how everything wrapped up, my friends are expressing their disappointment in me instead, telling me ""I'm not even done"".  I don't have a save file from before he left the school, so I'll have to play the entire game again to get this new ending content.

After this conversation I finally did a little Googling on what this was, and I see everyone calling it the ""true ending"".  Which honestly annoyed me more; why would something so crucial to the game's story be so optional, time-gated, and uninformative to the player?  I also saw that maxing Kasumi *and* Akechi will significantly add to the ""true ending"" content.  Am I simply at fault for not Googling how to not miss the most important part of the Royal version, before playing?  That's ridiculous, if so.



I digress, back to the question: Is it worth playing the entire game a second time immediately just for this ""true ending"" content?  Is it alright to just watch a no-commentary playthrough of 12/24 and onwards ([like this one](https://youtu.be/JBXluV8jIfc?si=CQharIix7tuwlyyh)) on YouTube instead?  Is it blasphemy that I accept my natural ending and not do any of the above? (Maybe just read up on it or watch a shorter video on the true ending)  All opinions are appreciated!



PS:  I really loved this game.  The soundtrack is in my daily relaxing playlist, and I'm now grinding fresh coffee at home every morning ❤️",0,1728378171.0,Persona5,4,0.44,False

1fyvb7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1fyvb7m/timeless_furniture_pieces_every_home_should_have/,Timeless Furniture Pieces Every Home Should Have,"When decorating your home, it’s tempting to chase trends. However, some furniture pieces stand the test of time, blending style, function, and versatility. These timeless pieces not only enhance your living spaces but also provide lasting comfort and durability. Whether you’re just starting to furnish your home or looking to refresh your decor, here are some essential furniture items that every home should have.

**1. The 2-Seater Couch: Compact and Cozy**

A [2 seater couch](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) is a must-have for any living room, particularly if you're working with a smaller space. This compact sofa style provides the perfect balance between comfort and size, making it ideal for cozy corners or apartment living. It’s versatile enough to suit different aesthetics—from modern minimalism to a more traditional setup—and can easily be paired with armchairs or ottomans to create a complete seating area.

Choose a neutral color like gray, beige, or soft blues for a classic, long-lasting appeal. The beauty of a 2 seater couch lies in its adaptability, as it can be styled with various throw pillows or blankets to update the look seasonally without needing to replace the entire piece.

**2. Contemporary Furniture: Sleek and Functional**

Investing in [contemporary furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) ensures your home maintains a fresh and up-to-date look while also being highly functional. Contemporary design is characterized by its clean lines, minimal ornamentation, and emphasis on natural materials. Pieces like streamlined armchairs, sleek dining tables, and functional storage solutions make contemporary furniture both stylish and practical.

The beauty of contemporary furniture is that it blends seamlessly with other styles, making it a great investment for any home. For example, a modern media console with a minimalist design can enhance both traditional and eclectic interiors.

**3. The Round Outdoor Coffee Table: Perfect for Outdoor Living**

A [round outdoor coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-coffee-tables) is an essential piece for any patio or garden, offering a stylish yet practical surface for entertaining guests or enjoying your morning coffee. The round shape not only promotes a sense of intimacy and flow in outdoor seating areas but also makes it easier to maneuver around, especially in smaller spaces.

When selecting a round outdoor coffee table, look for materials that withstand weather conditions, such as rattan, metal, or treated wood. This timeless piece of outdoor furniture can serve multiple functions, from holding drinks and snacks during outdoor gatherings to providing a stylish base for decorative accents like lanterns or potted plants.

**4. The Classic Armchair: Comfort Meets Style**

No home is complete without a classic armchair. Whether placed in the living room, bedroom, or home office, a well-designed armchair provides comfort and enhances the room’s decor. Choose a timeless shape like a wingback or club chair, and opt for durable upholstery fabrics like leather, linen, or high-quality synthetics that are easy to maintain.

**5. The Versatile Coffee Table: The Centerpiece of the Living Room**

A coffee table serves as the centerpiece of your living room. Whether you prefer a sleek glass top or a rustic wood design, the right coffee table adds both function and style to your space. Look for a versatile design with storage options or an open shelf to display books, candles, or decorative items. A rectangular or square shape works well in larger living rooms, while a round coffee table can soften the look of a more compact space.

**Why Timeless Pieces Matter**

Opting for timeless furniture ensures that your home remains stylish for years to come, no matter how trends may change. Quality craftsmanship, classic designs, and neutral tones make these pieces versatile and long-lasting. They also allow you to mix and match different styles over time, as timeless furniture serves as the perfect base for updating your decor with accent pieces, rugs, or wall art.

**Final Thoughts**

Incorporating a mix of 2 seater couches, contemporary furniture, and a round outdoor coffee table into your home decor will ensure you have a balanced, stylish, and functional living space. These timeless pieces offer both practicality and elegance, making them essential for any home. When selecting furniture, focus on quality materials and designs that fit seamlessly into your lifestyle, ensuring that your investment is one that will last for years to come.

Ik the basic. Lgbtq but idk anything else I have friends that are trans, they/them and i respect everyone I just don’t know the correct words so let me explain my situation hehe. 

I like ppl I think im bisexual bc I think some girls are cute but idk if I’d actually talk to a girl bc im also super attracted to masculinity. 

Ok so we got the basic knowledge you need about me now let’s go deeper, (no pun) 
if I like someone and we start talking these are the things that throw me off and I feel like they shouldn’t throw me off as much as they do. 

I either notice something I didn’t before about them that turns me off completely & it could be shallow e.g a guy at work that I seem often thought was super cute but when he talked to me I noticed he had a chipped tooth and I was unattracted. That’s stupid bc a tooth can be fixed but after I seen that I just couldn’t see him the same 

I also get nervous about the thought of committing and stop respond (this could be day 2 literally I overthink and stop communicating).

Or when they like me a lot and continuously compliment me/ act super dramatic when they see me like I’m Beyoncé. It’s fine and dandy don’t get me wrong I like it but. Every. Single. Time?? I feel as if they’re trying to love bomb me in a way that way I start reciprocating those feelings and then they’ll try to smash me lmaooo 

I should also mention I’m a virgin 😭

Another thing is if I like a guy eventually they will talk to me. Not even being cocky but they do and then I’m like ehh no. Like when it gets too serious for me I stop talking to them. Getting too serious for me is literally them asking to hangout outside of the place they met me. So work/school/gym. The only places I go. So when they want to go to dinner or coffee I freeze up for one I’ve only been on a few dates bc of my anxiety so I’m nervous about the proper attire lol I’m always so conscious about under dressing bc I’m not a girly girl but I just so happen to be pretty. I’m not wearing khakis and stuff I wear normal clothes but it’s just sweats, leggings, jeans & athletic shorts/biker shorts and printed Tee and crop tops so when I’m asking to go to a steak house I’m stuck bc I’m not the type of 22yr old to be in a fancy dress and heels and makeup but I assume that’s what ppl are expecting me to wear on “dates” and it’s just not me. 

Idk where I’m going with this but I’m confused with myself and if I’m even the dating type of person even though I so desperately want a s/o. Settling isn’t an option 

I also wasn’t allowed to date as a child so I have no experience in that area. I’ve had 2 boyfriends in my life and both were before I turned 10 so there’s that Lmaoo. 

And it’s not like the option isn’t there for me to date or not be a virgin I just want it to be right with the right person and someone who likes me for me not just bc they think I’m pretty with a nice body. This all probably sounds big headed but I swear I’m not I’m just lost in who I am and who I’m gonna be I’m also violently high rn 😭😭 so I’m just brain spilling ",1,1728377297.0,asexuality,0,1.0,False

1fyv6bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrotesquerieFX/comments/1fyv6bo/expanded_theory_observations/,Expanded theory /observations,"******spoiler*****



I posted this on one thread already about everyone’s amazing  ideas & connections & what they could represent etc… I tried to give a more in-depth explanation 

Then I started to point out some observations/ clues I noticed & 
came up with my own theory & realized I should prob just make a separate post at this point so just  in case my post gets lost or deleted, here it is:


I think they are trying to say in true AHS S2 form;
ALL MONSTERS ARE HUMAN 
The nun, the priest etc… they are all capable of sin but that alone does not necessarily make them evil     as oftentimes the good can outweigh the bad & even all the Saints were flawed & died tragically 
The popes red shoes= blood spilled my martyrs 
In Wizard of Oz- the WICKED witch was the one that stole Dorthy’s ruby slippers. The whole time they were on a mission to find the great & powerful wizard/ man behind the curtain, that was in charge, so they would have the heart/courage/brains to get Dorthy back home. They found out, he didn’t exist, it was just an illusion. They learned everything they needed was already in them. They just had to figure out how to find it. Once they did, Dorthy got the slippers & woke up from her dream. 
Ironically Dorthy was the one that ran away from home in the first olace bc she hated it. Once she got to Oz she realized there’s no place like home.
The Wizard of Oz was meant to be a happy-go-lucky & cheerful movie, for children.

Sadly, what took place behind the curtain IRL, was much darker. Dorthy, Judy Garland, was 15 or 16 when they began filming. In typical Hollywood fashion, she was abused & drugged daily. Similar to a Diddy freak-off’s but in the late 1930’s, when there were no hidden camera’s to record evidence. She was the main character but only made a tiny bit more than the dog, Toto. Meanwhile, nameless male characters were making $1,000+. Her mom put her on diet pills when she was 10yrs old. She was hooked on amphetamines & barbiturates as she was forced to take them everyday while filming. Her diet consisted of black coffee & cigarettes. Tragically, she passed away, a few weeks after turning 47 from an overdose.  

We have all the answers already. Lois is a detective/ expert on solving cases. In the AA meeting they even said Hell isn’t a place you go to, if already exists here. That instantly reminded me of the Tempest, “Hell is empty, all the devils are here”. Lois is trying to solve these murders, possibly the 7 deadly sins+. The entire time she seems to be in an almost dreamlike trance. She is constantly looking thru curtains. In the one scene where Merritt is making the video, there about a 3 second shot where Lois sees, what looks like Ed in the kitchen. She gets mad at Merritt for having a hospital curtain as a background. 

There are barely any scenes where Lois isn’t smoking. Literally everywhere. Based on the fact she is allowed to smoke in a hospital, the wardrobes & home decor, landline, music, booths in a restaurant etc..I would say this story is taking place in the 70’s. Even the nurse with RED hair, tells Lois to go to the cafeteria & get some black coffee. We never see her eat, only drink 24/7. After her accident, she asks Ed to help her escape. They drive off in his RED convertible. The blood is missing from victims bodies. You get the point. 

I’m not going to lie this next part I got from the show, Yellowjackets, but serial killers love puzzles. We saw Lois trying to put puzzles together twice already. Then Merritt solves the puzzle box (Hellraiser). It contains coordinates, most likely to Hell. We see Lois & the Nun driving right down the highway (to Hell) thru clouds of smoke. After performing a duet from Jesus Christ Superstar, sister Megan points out they the are driving directly into a trap & should be smarter then this but Lois just continues to drive straight on thru. 

My guess is that Lois was drunk & prob fell asleep w/ a lit cigarette. We see a piece of burned curtain in the beginning of episode, when Lois wakes up from her dream. She is probably the reason her husband is in coma. It’s possible she killed her daughter in the fire 🔥 too. If not, then it was in accident. EMS came (Red Cross) or she enabled her overeating until she has a heart ♥️ attack. Seems like Lois is trapped in state of altered consciousness, perhaps an NDE. When they are making the turducken, Lois has a quick flash of herself holding a candle. She still believes she’s innocent, a saint, flaunting around in her white suit, trying to catch the bad guy. We have seen 4 out of 7 DEADLY sins already. 3 representing the Tryon family. The Happy Ho🤣 I think LOIS is the killer & she enlists the help of nun/priest/nurse (who may just be ghosts/spirits) to commit these crimes, acting out, things that have happened in her own life, that she can’t process yet. I suspect towards the end, the curtain will fall & Lois will be forced to see herself clearly &/or take a look at herself in a mirror to see what she has really done. (either on her deathbed or in a psych hospital) Lois did say the perp usually shows up at the crime scene. Lois always rolls up late, all dressed up & never even flinches, after seeing these beyond gruesome murders. I’m sure she is use to it as it is part of her job but come on, even the cops are outside puking in the bushing. Again, a white power suit wouldn’t be my 1st outfit choice, heading to a  horrific crime scene. Lois is the there for less then a minute & pieces together 90% of what happened. I think it’s bc she did w/ the help of her new friends, or she watched it happen & already knows who did. Either way I think she’s def. in on it or at least helped state them: 

I don’t think it will unfold in a Shutter Island type way but similar to how AHS S1 showed the maid as being young/old depending on who was seeing her. That’s why I think the timeline is so off now. We are seeing different timelines play out simultaneously. Or it could all be a flashback & Lois is much older now & could have Dementia/ Alzheimer’s. 
Also, Merritt is 27 (27 club) & still lives at home with her mom. Does she go to school or work? & she still needs a babysitter?  They only show her waiting around the house for her mom to cook for her. Lois def feels & is guilty for something. 

That’s just my guess tho… does anyone else have other theories?",1,1728377243.0,GrotesquerieFX,0,1.0,False

Overall, it’s been pretty insightful. The app tracks mood, energy, sleep, and even caffeine intake. I realized that on days I drink too much coffee and skip breakfast, my energy crashes, and that’s when I start procrastinating on a lot of small tasks.

The tips are actually useful. One suggestion was to do a quick stretch in the morning, and it surprisingly helped me feel more awake and ready to get things done. The app also has challenges like a social media detox or 10000 steps a day, which I tried, helped me stay locked in for longer periods of time and break out of scrolling habits.

That said, like every other app, this one also has its downsides. One of them is that you need to log your data regularly, which can sometimes feel like another chore which I will probably procrastinate on. Also I wish there was a way to connect with others on the app to share progress. But overall, if you’re serious about understanding your procrastination patterns, Brainway could be worth a try.

I hope someone will find this helpful. You're free to share any other insights, if you've tried the app",6,1728377021.0,ProductivityApps,4,1.0,False

At the other end is a bit nice where it leads into the wharf and is joined by a hotel, shop and a retail unit that will hopefully become a pub or a restaurant. But everything in-between are medium density housing. 

My proposal is that the this is easily one of the best places for a tourist mix use space from end to end capitalising on its beautiful landscape. 

Imagine coffee shops, restaurants and retail lining the canal with outdoor seating. The office end mixed use housing, retail and office space and the wharf district improves upon. These things would just make a massive difference ",11,1728376951.0,CardiffDevelopments,3,0.93,False

Since I've spent quite a bit already, I want to do a simple, thoughtful 5 senses gift on a budget.

Here’s what I have so far:

* **Touch:** A sensual candle.
* **Taste:** Different chocolates for a fondue that he can choose from.
* **Hearing:** A card with a voice recording.
* **Sight:** A game set of question cards.

I’m struggling with smell though. Perfume is too expensive, I already got a candle, and he’s not into teas. I thought about coffee, but he’s not picky about which one he drinks, so it doesn’t feel special.

The idea is to pick gifts we can use that night or the next morning, though it’s not a strict rule. DIY or inexpensive ideas are welcome for all the senses too, but I really need help with smell! Thank you!",1,1728376292.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1fyuxro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fyuxro/need_advice_on_my_marriage_is_it_time_to_move_on/,Need Advice on My Marriage: Is It Time to Move On?,"I’m a 35-year-old woman, and I’ve been married to my 39-year-old husband for 7 years. We’ve been together for a total of 12 years, and we have a 3-year-old son. I’ve always had some underlying issues in our relationship, but recently, things have escalated, and I’m feeling completely overwhelmed.

Our marriage has never been perfect, but compared to others, it was peaceful enough. My husband has never been very emotionally expressive or affectionate. He doesn’t initiate date nights or show much spontaneity, and while that bothered me, I managed to accept it. However, I’ve always felt like he wasn’t putting enough effort into our relationship, the household, or even into bonding with our child.

For instance, when I ask him to do something specific, like dressing our son, he’ll do it, but there’s no initiative or interaction beyond the task. I thought maybe it was just because some men aren’t hands-on during the baby phase, and things would improve as our son got older. They did, but not as much as I’d hoped.

For almost four years, my husband has been sleeping in a different room. This started when I was pregnant because he snores, and he’d sleep in the living room to give me space to rest. However, after the baby was born, he never came back to our bedroom, despite me telling him several times that he was welcome to return. I suspect he just got used to it, and now it’s our new normal. I didn’t address it at the time, but now I wonder if it’s had a deeper impact on our relationship.

There are also smaller things that have started to add up over time. For example, my husband doesn't buy gifts for our son’s birthday or for me on my birthday or our anniversary; he simply expects me to handle it. It’s frustrating that I have thousands of pictures of him and our son, but almost none of me and my son—just selfies. We’re currently building the second floor of our home, and I’m the one dealing with contractors. He rarely compliments me or acknowledges my efforts, like when I work out regularly. Even though I still care about him, it feels like I'm the only one trying.

Then, six months ago, everything changed. My husband had a brain hemorrhage and ended up in the hospital for emergency surgery. He was in a coma for two weeks, and the doctors warned there could be permanent damage. Thankfully, when he woke up, he was able to walk and talk, but his cognitive abilities weren’t fully the same. He struggles to process thoughts and find words sometimes, which has added a new layer of complexity to our relationship. He also used to play video games and chat with friends online, but he no longer does that since his injury.

He was in and out of hospitals and rehabilitation for several months, and during that time, I was left to manage everything—our son, my job, the household. When he finally came home, I created a list of tasks to keep him engaged and help him reintegrate into daily life. Initially, he followed it, but it only lasted a week or two before he stopped. I repeatedly told him that I needed him to try harder and be more proactive, but he often responded with, “Oh, I didn’t realize that. You have to tell me.” I found myself in a position where I felt like I was carrying the entire load, both emotionally and physically.

Despite his health issues, I felt increasingly exhausted from managing everything. My son is now three and goes to daycare, but I’m the one who handles all the logistics. My husband works at my company, but even small things like ordering food through our group chat fall on me. He never initiates, and I often have to call him to remind him to take care of himself. It’s frustrating to see him treat his recovery as if nothing has happened, all while he seems to expect me to handle everything.

During this time, I began to feel like a caretaker rather than a wife. He hasn’t shown any romantic interest in me for months. We haven’t been intimate in over six months, and aside from brief morning kisses, our connection feels entirely platonic. While I was at the hospital, I was constantly checking in on him, expressing my love and concern, yet he never asked how I was coping with the situation. I felt like I was going to be widowed at a young age with a small child, and that realization was incredibly stressful.

As I navigated this tough period, I turned to an app to connect with others—not for dating but to find someone who could see me as a person and not just as a caregiver. I met a guy nearby, and we clicked well. I was upfront about being married and having a child, clearly stating I wasn’t looking for a relationship. We met for coffee, and the conversation flowed easily. Eventually, he accompanied me and my son on an outing, and it was evident he connected with my child in a way my husband doesn’t.

This led to us becoming intimate. I established boundaries—no relationships, just companionship. While I don’t love him, it made me realize that someone can provide the attention and care I’ve been missing from my husband. It highlighted the lack of emotional and physical connection I’ve been experiencing in my marriage.

Now, I’m at a crossroads. If it weren’t for the health crisis, I would have likely ended the marriage already. I still care about my husband and our family, but I feel like I’m his caregiver rather than his partner. I’m grappling with the guilt of considering leaving him after everything he’s been through, but I also recognize that my own needs matter.

I need advice on whether it’s wrong for me to think about ending this marriage. I’ve kept telling myself things might improve, but months have passed, and nothing has changed. I’ve communicated my needs and expectations, but it feels like we’re stuck. Should I stay and continue to fight for this relationship, or is it time to move on?",1,1728376100.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1fyuxiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_myaffiramai/comments/1fyuxiu/designing_your_perfect_day_how_custom_affirmation/,Designing Your Perfect Day: How Custom Affirmation Apps Can Help You Set the Tone,"https://preview.redd.it/8axry6fjshtd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e91dc6ade01762d61cd6f2268207a02d4763dfb

**Introduction: The Power of a Positive Start**

Starting your day with intention can make all the difference between a chaotic, stressed-out morning and one filled with focus and calm. Imagine waking up, and instead of being overwhelmed by tasks or deadlines, you’re greeted by words of encouragement and empowerment. Affirmations have long been recognized as a powerful way to reframe your thoughts and energize your mindset, and when incorporated into your morning routine, they can set the perfect tone for the day ahead.

[Custom affirmation apps](https://myaffirm.ai/best-daily-affirmations-app/) now allow you to take this process one step further by letting you personalize these positive messages to your own goals and needs. Whether you want to boost confidence, manage stress, or spark creativity, these apps offer a way to design your perfect day with just the right affirmations.

**Why Morning Affirmations Are Effective**

Morning routines are more than just habits—they lay the foundation for how we approach our day. Psychologists have long understood the impact of early thoughts on the brain’s ability to focus and manage stress. Affirmations, when spoken or listened to in the morning, help prime the brain for positivity, reducing anxiety and boosting motivation.

The reason affirmations work so well is their ability to rewire negative thought patterns. Instead of waking up with thoughts like, “I have too much to do,” an affirmation like “I am capable and ready for today” shifts the internal dialogue. Starting your day with positivity helps break cycles of stress and worry, creating space for productive, clear thinking. The first few hours after waking up set the stage for your overall mood and energy, making affirmations a valuable tool for shaping your mindset.

**Personalizing Your Morning Routine with Custom Affirmation Apps**

While general affirmations can be helpful, personalizing them takes things to the next level. Custom affirmation apps allow you to tailor affirmations that speak directly to your goals, values, and challenges. Rather than using one-size-fits-all statements, you can input specific affirmations related to different areas of your life—be it work, health, or relationships.

For instance, if you're focusing on improving your productivity, a custom affirmation might be, “I am focused and efficient today.” Alternatively, if your goal is to enhance your self-confidence, you could listen to, “I trust myself and my abilities to handle whatever comes my way.” These apps give you the flexibility to create affirmations that resonate with your unique circumstances, making them more impactful.

**Creating Affirmation Playlists for Different Moods and Tasks**

One of the most innovative features of custom affirmation apps is the ability to create affirmation playlists. This allows you to craft a collection of affirmations that align with different moods or daily tasks. Need a boost of energy before work? Create a playlist that focuses on confidence and focus. Winding down after a busy day? A playlist that centers on peace and relaxation can help calm your mind.

By designing playlists, you can mix and match affirmations that cater to your various needs throughout the day. The addition of soothing background music or nature sounds can further enhance the experience, creating a calming or energizing atmosphere depending on your goal. This level of personalization ensures that no matter the mood or task, you have the perfect affirmation to guide you through it.

**Incorporating Affirmations with Other Morning Practices**

Affirmations can be seamlessly integrated into other morning practices, multiplying their benefits. For instance, pairing affirmations with meditation can deepen your mindfulness practice, helping you to focus on your goals with clarity. If you enjoy journaling, writing down your affirmations reinforces their message and allows you to reflect on your progress.

Some people prefer to combine affirmations with physical movement, like yoga or a morning walk, letting the positive statements flow through their body as they move. This combination of mind and body engagement strengthens the connection between the affirmation and your daily activities, setting you up for success.

**Real-Life Examples: How Custom Affirmation Apps Have Transformed Mornings**

Consider Sarah, a busy entrepreneur who struggled to maintain balance in her daily life. She started using a custom affirmation app to design her morning routine. By inputting affirmations like “I handle challenges with grace and confidence” and listening to them while making her morning coffee, Sarah began to notice a shift. Her mornings, once filled with anxiety, became moments of calm and intention, allowing her to approach her workday with a clearer mindset.

Or think of James, a creative professional who used affirmation playlists to spark his creativity. By listening to his personalized playlist filled with affirmations like “My creativity flows effortlessly,” James found himself more inspired and productive throughout the day. The flexibility of custom apps allowed him to tweak his affirmations based on his mood, ensuring each day started with the right mindset.

**Custom Affirmation App: The Ultimate Tool for a Perfect Start (Last 250 Words)**

Custom affirmation apps offer a range of features that make them the ideal tool for designing the perfect start to your day. Not only can you personalize your affirmations based on your goals, but you can also adjust the frequency of the affirmations to match your needs—whether you need a reminder once a day or several times throughout.

These apps allow users to choose different voices, tones, and even languages, making the experience highly customizable. They also provide options to mix affirmations with soothing background music, nature sounds, or binaural beats, amplifying the positive effects. You can set reminders to listen to your affirmations during specific times, ensuring you never miss your moment of positivity.

Whether you're aiming for productivity, stress relief, or motivation, custom affirmation apps empower you to craft a morning routine that is both meaningful and effective. By incorporating personalized affirmations into your daily routine, you can transform your mindset, boost your mood, and create a powerful foundation for success.

1fyuwpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1fyuwpu/do_we_move_to_a_forever_home_now_or_move_to_a/,"Do we move to a forever home now, or move to a temp home for 5ish years then jump again when it's more affordable?","**TLDR** 

We were planning to move to a forever home in around 6-years time. Due to circumstances we are looking to move sooner than later, is it worth paying more on the mortgage NOW and being uncomfortable to get the forever home now, or get a cheaper one for 6-years and then move again, given assosciated costs of moving?


Combined take home - £6,000 per month

Outgoings all bills, fees and contracts - £1,000 per month

Food/travel - £550

Current mortgage - £1,025 @ 4.02% with Halifax - 3 years left

Equity - £200,000 & savings £50,000

House - £600,000 = £1,900 a month for 30-years at current interest.


**Background**


I'm 34, wife 32 with 2 children (3 and 2). We moved to Cornwall from Birmingham 4-years ago. It wasn't a forever home or area, but we wanted to stay for around 10-years, save up and then move to a nice big forever home.


The issue is, whilst my parents visit every other month, and friends probably twice a year, her family have never once came down (not even to see their grandchildren), and none of her friends have ever come to see her—they go out their way to arrange meet ups and city breaks the same distance from Birmingham but the other way (they're all childless, unemployed pyramid scheme woo-girls that live with parents in their 30s).

She isn't a confident driver, so I end up driving her back the 6 hour round trip with 2 kids every 3 or 4 weeks to see family and friends. The 100% effort so often and getting 0 in return has made the 3 hour distance feel like she's stuck in a black hole.


She has made a tonne of mother friends down here, and seems to go out twice a week with them for coffee mornings, soft play, tea and cake, shopping, country walks etc, but they aren't the family or old friends. Everytime we go back, her parents will ask her when we're moving back, they won't talk to her about things going on like her dad's prostate cancer which was treated, keeping secret it's all clear etc, all to gaslight her into thinking she has to go back.



My new work is likely to be Bristol-area, so I agreed let's look between Cheltenham, Corsham, Chippenham, Gloucester, so I can have a 30 minute commute granted traffic too.


To get the house size we want - nice area, driveway, good garden, 4 double bedrooms, large lounge, kitchen, dining area, garage .. we are looking around £600,000. This is £1,900 a month, which is around 31% of our incomings, leaving little room for actual savings and building our Vanguard.",1,1728375954.0,HousingUK,18,0.56,False

1fyus7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/istanbul/comments/1fyus7o/been_away_for_one_night_and_already_miss_istanbul/,Been away for one night and already miss Istanbul,"I spent a few days in your city with a group of skaters from London. I haven't been outside of Europe much, and I was a bit nervous. But I fell in love the minute I got there. That first night, when I left the hotel, it felt like the whole city was outside. Tables and chairs on the street, people drinking tea and chatting and smoking, traders selling everything.

The morning after, I woke up early and heard the Call to Prayer and it was so beautiful. I am not Muslim, but that call marking points throughout the day for the whole city felt fucking SUBLIME. 

I thought London was a big city, and it felt like the centre of the whole world sometimes. Istanbul changed that for me. I already knew it was on two continents, but actually being there and seeing the Bosphorous right in front of my dumb face, and experiencing the sheer scale of it all, blew my mind. I felt so small and unimportant. And yeah, I love the cats. Of course I love the cats.

I have read about the Theodosian Walls and the Column of Constantine and the Hagia Sofia, seeing all of this was a dream come true. I'm also a massive Assassin's Creed nerd, so I was pretty unbearable every time I went anywhere or saw anything featured in Revelations.

I cannot wait to come back. Next time I will spend more time, get a museum pass, and do nothing but history and drinking pistachio coffee (this was an unexpected highlight of the trip). What an incredible place. ",53,1728375350.0,istanbul,24,0.88,False
