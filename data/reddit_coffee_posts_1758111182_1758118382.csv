This time around, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pitch ideas for new Netflix whine-fests to a disgruntled executive, and he says no to all of them- mainly because many people are fed up with their victim narrative. So now, here's Harry and Meghan's Netflix Pitches! I hope you all enjoy it!

Meghan: Oh, my dear, dear friend! Thank you for having us. Well, having *me,* really. I'm the Duchess of Sussex, after all. Anyway, my husband and I have several groundbreaking ideas for our next Netflix show.

Executive: Yeah, right. Let's hear them.

Meghan: Ok, so first: Markling the Map. It's where I fly around the world and teach people how to live more authentically.

Executive: So, you fly in, talk about practicing something you don't actually preach, and then leave with a carbon footprint bigger than the city itself?

Meghan: Yes!

Executive: No thanks.

Harry: Alright then, Idea Number Two: Whose Crown is It Anyway? Contestants answer trivia about Meghan- because she said so- and then I tell them that they don't understand what it's like to be me. The winner gets a signed copy of Spare.

Executive: So essentially, it's a game show where you whine at strangers?

Harry: Exactly.

Executive: Nope. Not doing it.

Meghan: Alright, alright, one more... The Princess Diaries, But Real. It's about me, as a naive ingenue, re-enacting how unaware I was of royal life, and had no idea who my husband even was. I just wanted to know if he was kind.

Harry: And how the rest of the family victimized us! They said no to us being half-in, half-out!

Executive: Didn't you do that already?

Harry: *(nods)* We just need it to really sink in- that we are the world's biggest victims.

Executive: *(stands up)* We saw how poorly your other shows did. We're done here.

Meghan: But Ted Sarandos loves us!

Executive: You know what? He can have you.

Meghan: So is that a yes?

1nje3vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_beautifulmind8494/comments/1nje3vf/the_growing_popularity_of_stand_up_pouches_in/,The Growing Popularity of Stand Up Pouches in Modern Packaging,"In the fast-paced consumer market, packaging has become more than just a protective covering for products—it is a vital tool for branding, convenience, and sustainability. One packaging format that has seen tremendous growth in recent years is the **stand up pouch**. Characterized by its ability to stand upright on shelves due to its bottom gusset, the stand up pouch offers an appealing combination of practicality, functionality, and visual impact. It is widely used in industries such as food, beverages, pet care, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and household goods. With consumers demanding packaging that is not only protective but also user-friendly and environmentally conscious, the stand up pouch has proven to be a versatile and innovative solution.

One of the major strengths of stand up pouches lies in their **functional design and convenience**. The unique bottom gusset allows the pouch to expand when filled and stand stably on shelves, which enhances product visibility and attracts customer attention. Unlike traditional flexible pouches that lie flat, stand up pouches create a professional, tidy look that makes products more appealing in retail environments. They are also designed with consumer convenience in mind, often incorporating features such as resealable zippers, spouts, or tear notches. These elements make it easy for consumers to open, reseal, and reuse the packaging, reducing product wastage and improving user experience. From dried fruits and nuts to liquid detergents and sauces, the [**stand up pouch**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style/stand-up-bag) adapts to a wide variety of products, making it an ideal packaging choice across multiple sectors.

https://preview.redd.it/jqspxzocfqpf1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec5a65dd93f567d9ff6347898ae34f51d4c4f60c

Durability and **protection of product integrity** are additional reasons behind the popularity of stand up pouches. Constructed from high-quality laminated films, these pouches act as strong barriers against oxygen, moisture, and light, which are key factors that can degrade product quality. This makes them especially suitable for perishable items such as coffee, snacks, baby food, or nutritional supplements that require extended shelf life. The multilayer structure also provides excellent puncture resistance, ensuring that products remain intact during transportation and storage. For businesses, this translates into reduced losses due to damaged packaging, while for consumers, it guarantees fresh and safe products. The airtight sealing capabilities further enhance the pouch’s reliability, fostering trust in the brand.

Another significant advantage of stand up pouches is their **customization and branding potential**. With large, printable surfaces on both the front and back panels, brands can showcase vibrant designs, product details, and engaging visuals that instantly capture attention. The packaging can be customized with various finishes such as matte, gloss, metallic, or soft-touch, offering brands an opportunity to reflect their unique identity. Transparent windows can also be incorporated into the design, allowing consumers to view the product directly, which builds confidence in purchase decisions. Moreover, stand up pouches can be produced in various sizes, shapes, and styles to suit different product categories. The flexibility in design not only enhances shelf appeal but also strengthens a brand’s marketing strategy by making its products stand out in a crowded marketplace.

In today’s eco-conscious world, the **sustainability benefits of stand up pouches** cannot be overlooked. Compared to rigid packaging options like glass jars, metal tins, or plastic bottles, stand up pouches require significantly less material to manufacture, reducing waste and resource consumption. Their lightweight design lowers transportation costs and carbon emissions, making them a more environmentally friendly choice. Additionally, many manufacturers are now developing recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable pouch options to align with global sustainability goals and consumer demand for greener packaging. Businesses adopting eco-friendly stand up pouches not only reduce their environmental footprint but also improve their brand image by appealing to the growing base of environmentally aware customers. This shift towards sustainable packaging is shaping the future of the industry, and stand up pouches are at the forefront of this transformation.

In conclusion, the **stand up pouch has revolutionized packaging** by combining convenience, durability, branding opportunities, and sustainability in a single solution. Its ability to protect product quality while offering design flexibility makes it a highly adaptable choice across industries. Consumers benefit from easy-to-use and environmentally friendly packaging, while businesses gain a competitive edge through cost savings, improved product presentation, and alignment with eco-friendly values. As the global packaging market continues to evolve, stand up pouches are expected to remain a leading packaging format that meets the needs of modern commerce. By adopting this innovative packaging solution, companies can ensure that their products not only stay fresh and safe but also capture the attention of today’s discerning and sustainability-focused consumers.",1,1758117975.0,u_beautifulmind8494,0,1.0,False

Where am I going wrong?,"Recently learned I may have a fatty liver and I’m not sure where I’m going wrong. I have an appointment to follow-up with my doctor, but I’m looking for input from others. Help? 😞

In any given day I typically consume 2 cups of coffee and endless water. (I don’t do not drink alcohol.)

Breakfast is often a protein shake or bowl of Kashi GO protein & fiber cereal.

Lunch includes fruit, such as strawberries, grapes, apples, bananas, or peaches, mixed nuts, dried fruits/raisins, and maybe a granola bar. Sometimes I have peanut butter with the apple.

Dinner is my largest meal of the day. It’s always a protein, most often with green beans, broccoli, or carrots, and a starch, typically potato, sweet potato, or white rice.

Snacking can be challenging, but I’ve become much better focusing on nuts, fruit/dried fruit, frozen yogurt bars, and sometimes sweet potato chips. If I need bread, it’s always the Dave’s Killer brand.

I have always struggled to have a successful relationship with food. Abysmal eating habits and food choices were fostered going up, so I’ve always struggled to make the right food choices. I’ve spoken to nutritionists who simply say my diet is fine, yet I am overweight and now potentially sport a fatty liver. I am actively working to move my body more as I have regrettably settled into a fairly sedentary lifestyle, but I do what I can, mostly it’s a short walk on work breaks.

Are there any good spots (presumably in the greater Downtown area?) to just walk around for even an hour or two? Shop at a few stores, grab some food or coffee without opening up google maps, etc?

Felt like i couldn't get anything done without that morning boost and afternoon top off.
But when I actually tracked what I was accomplishing during those ""productive"" caffeine hours, most of it was just busy work and switching between tasks rapidly. I managed to stay productive even though I failed to complete any essential work.

The rush of energy caffeine gave me was perfect for answering emails and reorganizing my desk but terrible for deep work that required sustained concentration. Would start projects but never finish them because my attention was too scattered.
Now without caffeine my focus feels slower to start but way more sustained once i get going. Can work on one thing for hours without getting distracted or feeling like i need to be doing five things at once.
Also not constantly managing my energy levels throughout the day. Don't need to time my important tasks around when the caffeine kicks in or worry about crashing at inconvenient times.
Been using some natural focus aids occasionally like l-theanine, adaptogenic herbs, ozzi when I need appetite control during long work sessions. But mostly just learning to work with my natural energy rhythms instead of forcing artificial ones.
Quality of work improved even if quantity feels lower. Rather complete one good project than start ten mediocre ones.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Oakland Athletics vs. Boston Red Sox: A Playoff-Atmosphere Soap Opera**

The Oakland Athletics (71-80) and Boston Red Sox (82-69) are set for a high-stakes showdown in Fenway Park, where the drama is as thick as the New England fog. Let’s break down this matchup with the precision of a stathead and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many espresso shots.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The betting market is screaming, “Back Boston, but don’t expect a blowout.” The Red Sox are favored at **-160** (implied probability: \~61.5%), while the Athletics sit at **+240** (\~29.4%). The total runs line is set at **9.0**, with the under priced slightly higher, which feels like a cruel joke given Boston and Oakland’s recent habit of playing 1-2-3 baseball.

Key stats? Boston’s offense is a .244 batting average in their last 10 games—about as thrilling as a tax audit. The A’s, meanwhile, are hitting .280, led by Nick Kurtz, who’s been launching homers like a human-powered fireworks display (five HRs, nine RBIs). On the mound, Boston’s Lucas Giolito (3.31 ERA) is trying to snap a two-game losing streak, while Oakland’s Jeffrey Springs (4.28 ERA) has been a pitcher in search of a punchline, giving up 10 runs over his last three starts.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Metaphors

The Athletics are riding a **five-game winning streak**, including a 2-1 thriller over Boston last night where they scored like a couple of shy teenagers at a dance—reluctantly, but effectively. Manager Mark Kotsay called the series “playoff atmosphere,” which is code for “we hope our young players don’t faint from the pressure.”

For Boston, the stakes are existential. They’re 1.0 game behind the Yankees in the AL wild-card race, and manager Alex Cora is begging his team to “slow it down and cash in.” Easy for him to say—his coffee order probably includes a side of calm. The Red Sox are also getting back outfielder Wilyer Abreu from the IL, which is good news unless he’s allergic

A bit about me:

* Cycling is a passion of mine now - I started with mountain biking and more recently road cycling.

* I’ve picked up learning piano.

* Big movie buff, love watching shows and my music taste is all over the place - from metal/rock to classical, orchestral and even American country.

* Used to love gaming and would be open to getting back into it if it meant hanging out with new friends online.

As for the kind of friends I’m hoping to make:

* I’ve always gotten along really well with female friends and I miss having that in my life.

* That said, I’d also love some guy friends who are more into actual conversation than just chest-thumping bravado (no shade if that's you).

If you’re into good conversation, a few laughs, or even some lighthearted banter, send me a message. No pressure, just curious to see who’s out there and maybe make a new connection.

What about you? How do you like to spend a lazy day? Drop me a DM and let’s swap stories.

I’m 34, married, straight, and based in Ireland. I’ve been feeling the lack of real friendships lately and would love to find some like-minded people to chat with, maybe game with or eventually even meet up in real life (if it feels right).

A bit about me:

* I’ve been on a personal transformation the past few years, got into the gym and lost 35kg.
* Cycling is a passion of mine now - I started with mountain biking and more recently road cycling.
* I’ve picked up learning piano.
* Big movie buff, love watching shows and my music taste is all over the place - from metal/rock to classical, orchestral and even American country.
* Used to love gaming and would be open to getting back into it if it meant hanging out with new friends online.

As for the kind of friends I’m hoping to make:

* I’ve always gotten along really well with female friends and I miss having that in my life.
* That said, I’d also love some guy friends who are more into actual conversation than just chest-thumping bravado (no shade if that's you).
* Open to online chats (Discord, Snapchat, Insta, whatever works) or eventually grabbing a coffee or going for a cycle - essentially whatever works.

Not into anime/manga (seems a lot of people on Reddit are) and I’d describe myself as having some traditional values.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

(or something else),"My husband (36M) and I (35F) are both high earners and we have two kids in elementary school. Household income this year will be around $550k-$600k. We have three properties: our primary residence and two small houses on a lake about 1 hr away. Equity/mortgage info are below. 

* Primary Residence: Bought in 2019, worth \~$800k and we owe $340k at 2.75%
* Small Lake House: Bought in early 2022, worth $250k and we owe $165K at 3.25%
* Big Lake House: Bought in 2024, worth $540k and we owe $400k at 6.63%

All told we have about $1.6m in properties, $700k in equity and $900k in mortgages at various rates. 

The two lake houses are also short term rentals and come close to covering their own mortgage payments and other costs. They also give us a tax benefit and go up in value each year. 

Our primary residence was built in 2000 and while it is functional - its also dated. It is in a good neighborhood, but it is not walkable to anything. You can walk around it and it is safe, but I can't walk to a coffee shop. We just got a quote for a kitchen renovation and some other upgrades. Its going to cost $250k-$300k and 4 months of construction to get the house properly upgraded. We could cash flow a good chunk of this, but would need to finance some as well. 

We are toying with the idea of just selling this house and moving to a house that is more up to date and in a better location. In our area this would probably look like \~$1-$1.2m home. It would be easier and solve more of our issues, but would end up costing more. We would also lose our precious low interest rate. 

I'd love to hear from others who have done a house reno or chosen not to. Any thoughts or lessons learned? Is there a major thing I'm missing here? 

The other kind of crazy thing we are considering is selling all our properties, getting rid of our mortgages and renting somewhere nice. I am not sure if this is wise long term, but my husband is getting tired of taking care of houses haha. ",5,1758117291.0,HENRYfinance,9,1.0,False

1. Ginza Gyu (Wagyu Skirt Claypot) – ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Pretty good, tender and flavorful, but a bit on the sweet side. Kinda missed how in Japan they usually serve it with miso soup or broth so you can enjoy it in different ways.


2. Yardstick (Yardshake) – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Always a win for me. Not my first time but still love it. A creamy coffee/dessert hybrid I’ll never get tired of. Perfect post-meal treat.


3. Gino’s Brick Oven Pizza (Burrata + Panna Sausage) – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Burrata was super creamy and paired perfectly with the sausage pizza. Honestly, can’t go wrong with this combo.


4. Curator (Double Rainbow) – ⭐⭐⭐½
The drink itself was good, balanced flavors, but the overall experience felt off. The place was cramped and noisy, and for the price, the serving felt a bit underwhelming. Maybe I just went on a bad night. Don’t let that stop you from checking it out as they brand themselves as the ‘Best Bar in the Philippines,’ so it might be worth experiencing for yourself.


5. Brunch Bureau (Korean Chicken Chop + Vietnamese Coffee) – ⭐⭐⭐½
Was supposed to get the classic trio but it’s off the menu now. The chicken chop was more breading than chicken (though crispy), kimchi rice was tasty with just the right spice. Coffee was okay. Sat outside instead of inside (crowded), which turned out better since I got to read my book in peace.

FIRST LOVE. call her n.
we met through a mutual friend. at first she did not stand out, just another face in the crowd. i came back home one morning after a boys night and i saw that she texted me that it was raining heavily, that she was stuck on a bus in traffic, headed to a mall ten minutes from my house to shop for a friend’s gift. i looked outside and the sky was clear. confused, i told my mother, and she just rolled her eyes. “she wants to meet you,” she said, and went back to her work. (i come from a chill family) 
i packed my umbrella into my bag and went anyway. at the mall i waited, and ten minutes later n arrived. she was happy to see me until she noticed the cigarette in my hand. her smile faltered. i threw it away immediately. we talked a little, and when i was about to leave she tugged at my sleeve and said, “where are you going? who’s going to carry my bags?” she was smiling, and i was surprised at myself for not saying no.
the truth was, i was not in a good place. i was spiralling into addictions, wasting myself away, always running when someone tried to be good to me. but i stayed. we spent the whole day together, wandering from mall to mall, eating at street vendors, laughing, joking, time slipping through my fingers. that day, for the first time, i noticed her.
she was ethereal, as if God Himself had carved every feature. brown wavy hair, fair skin, brown doe eyes, heart shaped lips, sharp nose. she looked like what i imagine angels must look like, all being made in her image.
i dropped her home around 9:30. as soon as she left, i walked to a nearby store and bought a cigarette. i had not smoked once the whole day with her, and i was an addict, smoking for three years already. even now, as i write this, i have one between my fingers.
after that day we saw each other more often. once a week turned into every two days, then every day. i memorised her schedule, picking her up from school, dropping her at tuition, waiting for her classes to finish, taking her home. she was everywhere in my life.
about me. i was born christian but never lived it up until her. reckless, impulsive, dangerous, the boy parents warned their kids about. i had FIRs on me, nearly went to juvie three times and i was indefinitely suspended from school. I was trouble.
but her, she was the opposite. she made me better. she was the rainbow after my flood, a promise from God that He would never send a bad time again. she brought colour into my greyscale world.
then the storm started. one of my exes, L, started trouble with me before her own birthday. she ruined her own day but told everyone i had done it. i half believed her because i always felt like a screw up. weeks later i confessed to n how much it disturbed me. she held me so tight i forgot how to breathe and told me she was proud, that she knew it was hard for me to open up.
that night on call i realised how lucky i was, and how unfortunate she was to be with me. she was everything i was not. she was brilliant in studies, full of hobbies, the kind of girl every man dreamed of. i was nothing close to worthy.
she used to draw flowers on the cuts across my knuckles with her pen. she cried when i got into fights, scolded me every time. i stopped fighting. i stopped drinking. even cigarettes reduced. i no longer stank of smoke, because she hated the smell. she met my family, i started going to church with her. i even went grocery shopping with her mother. she became so woven into my existence. even our names mirrored each other, her beginning letter was my ending and her ending was my beginning.

about L again. i told n we should meet her so i could apologise properly. we planned it, but on the day n was sick. i said i would cancel, but she insisted i should go alone. she said she trusted me, said she loved me. so i went, apologised, and told L that if she ever needed help she could call me. (n knew)
after that things were perfect again. one evening, while we watched movies on her laptop, she started talking about our future, moving in together, decorating a place of our own. i just looked at her and smiled. it felt like life was finally better. she joked, “baby, what if we get into college together?” and i knew then what i had to do. i applied to her dream college. i never wanted to leave my city, but for her i would. i did not tell her. i wanted it to be a surprise. (mind you, n is two years younger than me, i was ready to do long distance without a second thought) 
but misunderstandings started. we fought more. L took advantage, talking to me more often. i even told L about my plan to join n’s college, about how much i loved her.
then came the night i ruined it all. n and i fought, i do not even remember what about, only that it was my fault. she said she needed time. i could not handle it. i went to my best friend’s house. he knew how hard i was on myself when i hurt her. he offered me a beer. i said no, i had been clean of everything except cigarettes for seven months. he convinced me and i drank.
eight bottles later, i lost myself. that night was meant to be the night n and i made peace. she started to say, “if i ever leav-“ and i cut her off, almost shouting, “haa toh jaa na phir, you think i cannot live without you? i give you importance once and you think it is permanent?”
my friend looked up from his laptop, staring at me like he knew i had destroyed everything. she cried, hung up, and did not return. i realised instantly what i had done. i called her 271 times that night. she did not answer. i wanted to go to her house but my friend stopped me. i broke down, he looked after me. i did not sleep. it was our eight month anniversary.
the next morning she finally called. after hours of convincing, we agreed to stay friends. i accepted, because i needed her in any way i could. but the days after felt strange. we did not meet. not the next day either. on the third, we went shopping. she bought me a toy car. that night, i did not sleep again.
the following week i had to go to bangalore for a family event. before leaving we met every day, and she was sad that my phone would be off during the flight. then one day, she suddenly stopped talking to me. our friends blocked me. i was in another state with no way to reach her. i tried snapchat, email, even pinterest, any account she had. nothing. blocked.
when i came back to my city, still nothing. i waited outside her tuition, her school. she avoided me like the plague.
L stepped back into the picture, talking to me while also talking to n behind my back. she lied to n about me, fed her stories about what i was up to and how pathetic i am. to me she acted like she cared. eventually L and i got together, and then she confessed she had sabotaged everything because she “loved” me. she knew i would die for n, and she still did it.
months later we broke up. i resented her. she cheated on me more than once.

now, a year and a half later, i am in a worse place than ever. but i still love n. i pray for her every single day, for her safety, for her happiness. sometimes i stalk the instagram page of the ngo she works with, just to see her.
so listen to me. if you have someone like that, do not let her go. fight for her. change for her. please. i die a little every day without my n. i will always love her. i will always wonder about the what ifs. she was the music, the magic, the colour. without her, i am only black and white.

i am sorry n. i’m sorry for everything. i love you so much baby, i hope you’re okay and i hope you’re not drinking too much coffee again and i still stand by what i wrote in that email.
“in the mundane, the magic and laughter, i will be yours, now and ever after.”

Although after a while she took the cigarette from her, and started smoking I felt bad because I don’t like cigarettes then after she went to the next shop to buy a new cigarette for herself and started smoking, we were looking at them just casually while eating paratha, my friends are also introverts they never approached a girl in their lives. Then I took the challenge because my friends thought that I couldn't do this so the second girl left the shop and I think she went to buy a new cigarette. Just to show my guts I went to the that pretty girl and said Excuse me, I just saw you from there and you are looking pretty, She said Thanks, I introduced myself to her and asked her name, college, year and hometown then my mind stopped working because in a 1 or 1.30 minute talks I asked for her Instagram her reply was what, i said are you commited and she said yes after i said thank you ok bye and came to my friends and tell what talk goes. Ik i did many mistakes but the aura that was created in my friend they said bro you have guts They didn’t think that I would go. Btw I don’t live in Satya Niketan and her college is also different from mine so I don’t think I will see her face again, I am also clear she is not my type I used her as my subject to cop with my social anxiety and to give a demo to my friends, I am also not good at talking not only with girls but boys also.

___________________________________________

It had been only a few days since the Cerberus left shore, and already the sea had settled into its rhythm — endless gray waters, the soft churn of the wake, the gulls thinning as the coast disappeared.

Captain Elric trudged along the upper deck with his morning coffee, steam curling in the wind. One of the few luxuries he always brought back from the mainland. Normally, this early in the cold morning, the deck was empty.

But today he wasn’t alone.

“Morning,” he grunted.

The woman from the day of departure was already there, standing at the rail, tea in hand. She looked out over the waters with that same glacial stillness that had caught his eye before.

“Captain,” she replied, voice soft but edged, as though her lungs carried old scars.

He sipped, curious. Most passengers avoided the dawn chill.

“So. Tell me,” she said after a pause. “Have you been sailing these seas very long?”

“Longer than I’ve lived on land.”

“What’s it like? Sailing a ship. Is it difficult?”

He smirked. “I suppose. You ever sailed before?”

She thought for a moment, her gaze still on the horizon. “The only thing I ever floated on was a canoe. But that was me paddling for my life.”

“Then you know the sea’s got a mind of its own. Pulls and pushes at you. If you’re not careful, she’ll smash you on the rocks and drag you under.”

“Spoken from experience?”

“Hmph.” He chuckled into his coffee.

Silence stretched between them, broken only by the gulls.

“I don’t like these deep waters,” she admitted at last. “You never know what’s lurking down there.”

“Best not to. The deeper you go, the stranger the fish.”

Before she could answer, a voice called out behind them:

“Hey, Ada!”

They both turned. The man from the other day was striding toward them, eyes bright, smile too easy.

“Breakfast’s ready,” he said cheerfully. “Come on.”

Her expression froze, unreadable. The Captain only watched, thoughtful, as she set down her empty cup.

....................

As the days passed, the Cerberus had now begun to feel less like a ship and more like a floating town. Meals in the dining hall became the main social event, where passengers naturally drifted into groups and friendships.

Some passengers preferred to keep to themselves, but most had already exchanged names and stories by the second or third breakfast. A few even carried themselves as if they were attending a grand holiday rather than an uncertain voyage into foreign waters.

Among them, one pair always drew attention.

They weren’t a couple—not in any official sense—but they were always seen together. Their dynamic fascinated the other passengers: the man, warm and irrepressible, carried himself with easy charm, while the woman beside him radiated an aloof chill. He smiled and laughed, playing cards and telling jokes; she read in silence, speaking only when pressed, usually by his relentless teasing.

It was, in a way, a performance the dining hall never tired of.

This morning was no exception.

The man suddenly felt a tug at his sleeve and looked down to find a small child staring up at him with wide eyes.
“Well, hello there,” he said, his smile breaking wide. In a heartbeat, he had scooped her up, spinning her once before settling her on his lap.
“Aw! So cute!” he beamed, holding the child’s tiny hand out toward his companion. “Ada, Ada—look! Isn’t she adorable?”

The woman lifted her eyes from the book she was reading. One glance, a pause… and she lowered them back again, indifferent.

Her cold dismissal sent a ripple of silent judgment through the hall.
[What…a…bitch…] the watching passengers thought almost in unison, even as the man continued to charm the child into giggles.

Eventually, the child was returned to her parents, and the man leaned across the table, craning his neck to peek at the woman’s book.
“What is it you’re reading, anyway?” he asked, half-curious, half-accusing. His eyes caught the title, and his brows shot up. “Wait—don’t tell me. You’re learning Solvara County’s language?”

She turned a page, licking her finger to smooth the edge.
“I’ve already got the hang of it,” she replied.

[How terrifying.] The man thought.

“You said you were going there for work. Sounds like you’re planning to stay for quite a while,” he said, tilting his head.

Before she could answer, a uniformed crewmember appeared at their table, bowing politely.
“Ahem. Pardon the intrusion. If it suits your tastes, we do keep a modest collection of books on board. Guests are free to peruse them at their leisure.”

The woman froze, eyes flicking up sharply. “…You have a library?”

The crewmember faltered under her sudden intensity.
“W-well, yes, though it’s not our most popular entertainment—”

“Take me there,” she interrupted, already rising from her seat. Her hand clamped firmly on his shoulder as she began steering him toward the door.

“Oi…oi…” the other man muttered, left behind with his half-finished breakfast. With a weary sigh, he stood and followed after them.
 [Don’t just walk off on your own!]

.....

The library turned out to be a cozy, wood-paneled space tucked into the ship’s heart. Though smaller than one might expect, it was handsomely furnished with deep armchairs and quiet alcoves. Most of the shelves held maritime journals in a dozen languages, but a section had been set aside for fiction and travelogues.

The woman’s eyes scanned the titles hungrily.
“So tell me,” she asked the crewmember, “why wasn’t this mentioned in any of the brochures or maps?”

“Ah. Well.” The crewman cleared his throat. “The Cerberus underwent a rebranding last year. The library was deemed…underwhelming for marketing purposes. The company preferred to highlight our more popular attractions.”

“You did good.” She said.

Dismissed, the crewmember fled with visible relief.

“Don’t tell me you plan to stay in here the entire voyage,” the man groaned, leaning against the doorway.

“You don’t have to stay here,” she said evenly, tracing her finger down a spine before pulling out a travel guide. Opening it, she stopped on an illustration of Solvara County’s shorelines and the bustling port where their ship would soon dock.


“Is this your first time in Solvara County?” he asked, peering over her shoulder.

“Yes.”

“I thought you said you’d traveled before?”

“Only within my home region.”

""I see.""

She closed the book, sliding it back into place just as the speakers overhead crackled to life with the captain’s voice:
“Ladies and gentlemen, please make your way to the upper deck for your scheduled safety drill.”

The man smirked. “Well, there goes your reading time,” 

She ignored the quip, brushing past him toward the door. “We’d better not be late.”

“Worried about missing the exciting demonstration of how to wear a life vest?” His tone was playful, but when she didn’t answer, he followed after her. “You really do live for rules, don’t you?”

..................


The Cerberus’ upper deck was alive with motion. Passengers trickled out of stairwells and corridors, blinking against the sunlight as they adjusted to the sudden brightness. Crew members in crisp uniforms directed them into neat rows, their voices carrying sharp and practiced authority.

The sea stretched endlessly around them, a deep blue plain cut by the ship’s steady wake. Above, gulls wheeled and cried, their presence uncanny this far from shore.

The man and woman emerged side by side, though she gave no indication that their proximity was deliberate. He adjusted his collar against the breeze, watching her tuck a strand of hair behind her ear.

“Cheerful lot, aren’t we,” he murmured, glancing at the assembled passengers. Some looked curious, others impatient, and a few already had the pale, anxious faces of those prone to seasickness.

The woman remained silent, her eyes fixed on the officers arranging the demonstration.

The captain himself soon strode onto the raised platform at the deck’s center, his presence commanding enough to still the chatter.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he called, his voice booming above the wind, “for your safety and peace of mind, we will now conduct a standard drill. It is a formality, yes, but one that saves lives when the sea decides to remind us who is master.”

His words carried a weight that drew even the restless passengers into attention. The man- Claude’s easy grin faded, replaced with something keener, more thoughtful.

“You’d think we were preparing for war, not just a drill,” he murmured.

“That’s exactly what you should think,” Ada replied. “Accidents don’t announce themselves beforehand.”

Her gaze was sharp, calculating. Claude studied her for a moment, that same playful grin back on his lips again, though his eyes flickered with something unreadable.

Crewmen unfurled canvas tarps to reveal neat rows of life vests and collapsible lifeboat rigs. Demonstrations began, with sailors securing ropes and showing how to fasten buckles. Passengers watched, some with interest, others with boredom.

Soon orange vests were handed out with barked instructions. Ada tugged hers tight, methodical, while Claude fastened his with easy grace beside her.

The man leaned slightly toward the woman.
“Think anyone here would actually manage if something went wrong?”

She didn’t answer right away. Her gaze was sharp, calculating as she studied both crew and passengers alike—their clumsy fumbling, their careless laughter. When she finally spoke, her voice was quiet but precise.
“Half of them, maybe. The rest would panic.”

The man chuckled under his breath.
“Guess we’d better make sure we’re in the half that doesn’t.”

The drill master shouted the next order: line up, board the lifeboat, steady footing. Passengers hesitated, clumsy with straps and balance. But when Claude stepped forward, he did so with smooth certainty, dropping into the boat without fumbling, offering a hand to the woman behind him without needing instruction.

Ada noticed. Against her will, she noticed. That kind of ease did not belong to a harmless wanderer. It belonged to men who had practiced such things until it was muscle memory. Soldiers.

A sharp whistle cut through the air, pulling their attention back to the captain. He surveyed the crowd with a stern eye, then allowed a rare smile.
“That concludes the drill. You are free to return to your leisure. But remember what you’ve seen here today—should the time ever come, hesitation is death.”

The passengers began to disperse in clumps of chatter.

The woman turned to leave, already making for the stairwell, but the man caught up with her stride.
“You looked like you were actually measuring their odds back there,” he teased.

“Because I was,” she replied flatly.

“And what about me? Where do I fall in your tally?”

She glanced at him once, expression unreadable, then looked ahead again.
“You panic. You just hide it well.”

“You…” Claude said his voice suddenly solemn.

She turned, brow lifted. “??”

He looked curious, “What exactly do you do? A doctor?”

“…I’m a researcher.”

“One that carries a gun?” His grin ghosted across his lips again.

She gave him a side glance, cool as steel. “I think you know, by now, what kind of background I come from.” After all, if she can see through him, he probably saw through her as well.

He fell silent for a beat, following in her shadow.
“So. What kind of research brings you to a place like Solvara county?”

“The kind that could save a few lives.” Hopefully. If the one she sought was real, and not some cruel hoax.

Claude studied her, thoughtful. Then his expression shifted, boyish determination lighting his face.
“Right. It’s decided!”

“…??”

“I’ll help you,” he announced. “Once we reach Solvara county, I can show you around. Even someone as capable as you must need the help sometimes. And I’ve been there many times already—I know people.”

Her first instinct was to cut him off. To tell him no. But his blue eyes held none of the games this time. Just sincerity.

[That… he means it.] She thought. [And I have no one in Solvara county. No contacts, no allies. Once we land, I’ll be on my own. No. I’m already on my own, out here at sea. Maybe… maybe accepting his help isn’t such a bad idea.]

“…Alright, Mr Claud. I’ll hold you to that promise.”

“Promise?” His grin lit up. “That’s right! It’s a promise.” He held out his pinky finger expectantly.

The woman stared at him in disbelief, […What are you, a child?]

“Come on, you can do it,” he teased.

She'd hoped she wouldn't come to regret accepting his help but...
[Already too late.] She sighed, hooking his pinky with her own.

“Ada, I promise I’ll keep you far away from the library and make sure you have a good time on this ship.”

“That’s not necessary…” She turned away and walked off.

____________

That night, B lay in his bed, staring at the ceiling, recalling the promise he made.

[What was I thinking?] He wondered.

Then—

He heard it.

“…?” 

Coughing. Muffled, but there.

He touched the thin wall beside him. Her wall. He could picture her small frame, curled in her bed, stifling the sound so no one would notice.

[Well. Too late for that now.]

* 35, male, no family history of colorectal cancer that I know of, don't smoke, don't drink, pretty average height and weight, go to the gym regularly, all other blood work normal other than slightly elevated Bilirubin
* No pain, no bloating, no change in bowel habits that I know of, stool passes easily about finger width every day 1-3 times a day with my morning coffee, no blood, no weight loss, no fatigue
* I have OCD (this will be relevant later)
* Went to gastro 1 because I had some slight discomfort very close to my rectum, thought it was an ingrown hair, but have great insurance so figured I'd discuss with a specialist
* He did not do a manual exam, but noticed my anxiety, and said something like ""I'll order this test, I'm sure it'll come back negative, and we can forget about this""
* Occult blood stool test came back positive
* I freaked out, rushed to see Gastro 2 the next day to discuss - he did a manual exam and confirmed the anal abcess (something about glands in this area get blocked sometimes, no big deal), and said he found an internal hemorrhoid.
* He said he would order a FIT and Calprotectin test, and ""if positive, we will do a colonoscopy"" but also did not seem worried (""nothing alarming here"")
* After this, the original calprotectin test from gastro 1 came back (I didn't know it was ordered as well) at 18 ug/g
* I saw gastro 1 for a follow-up yesterday to discuss, he mentions that standard protocol with *any* positive FOBT test is a colonoscopy and endoscopy to rule out other sources but agreed he still does not expect to find anything

Also perhaps relevant is that unrelated to all this I had an abdominal MRI for my liver where they seemed to have checked out everything and it was noted:

""There is no evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or free fluid in abdomen.  
Major vessels appear normal.  
No gross bowel abnormality of note is detected.""

So I am wondering if I need to do the colonoscopy at all. The reason OCD is relevant is that I am trying to - as rationally as I can - weigh the pros and cons here: the pro of knowing for sure, but the con of ""for sure"" not really existing. Concretely, I'm scared of them finding some benign polyps during this exam simply coincidentally because I read they occur in up to 20% of the population, then I will worry about that. Basically is the added stress worth the results of the colonoscopy/endoscopy? Could I just retest in a few months? 

It's hard to explain this for those that aren't familiar with OCD since it sounds irrational, but basically I am worried about doing the procedure for the same reason I feel stupid to have gone to the doctor at all. Initially I said to myself ""this is surely nothing, if it goes away in a week I'll forget about it, if not, I'll see someone"". But my OCD got the better of me and I rushed to get reassurance, when sure enough a few days after the appointment the discomfort has almost totally gone away, and instead I opened up a pandora's box and did a stool test and went to the hospital 4-5 times to talk with specialists. I'm worried about the same thing happening here: basically, thinking I'm doing the *right* thing by getting the test, when in reality it's totally unnecessary given my profile, and they might find other things that will stress me out more and that stress isn't worth the potential benefit of the test. This is what I'm struggling with. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. 

Given the above, what is your take? Is a colonoscopy and endoscopy necessary? ",1,1758116928.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

We met for a coffee and ended up talking for 2.5 hours laughing and sharing all kind of things. She said we should repeat that sometime, she messaged me on my way back and I told her that I really want to see her again. She said something like lets see when we find time for it and that she got an interview for this or next week scheduled (its really important to her since her visa and other things rely on it) and she will let me know when she knows the exact day of the interview. After some more messages I just wanted to give her space for now, but my friends said I should at least make some plans for a second date. So I messaged her a small supportive message at the start of the week and after some messages I invited her for dinner sometime after her interview so we can celebrate. And she said thats a sweet idea and she will definately let me know when the interview is over and she will have some time to realx.

I was given the advice that I should keep texting her from time to time, just little things like how are you doing (again, my plan was to just give her some space since this is important to her, of course I want to know how she is doing but I feel like she might just want to focus right now)

And now I cant stop thinking about how I might mess this up.

\- Am I too passive?  
\- Am I already to clingy/needy/annoying?  
\- Am I not good enough for her and she knows?  
\- Is she maybe talking to someone who she likes better?   
\- Is she bored by the messages I send her?

Hi everyone! We’re building Fundora, a purpose-driven early-stage startup with a big vision: to empower Indian artisans by bringing their crafts to urban consumers under one strong brand. Our mission is to ensure artisans are paid fairly while their work gets the recognition it deserves.

We’re still at the ground floor — small team, website under development, and just starting to connect with artisans. This means every contribution you make will directly shape the direction of Fundora.

**Role: Backend Development & Operations Intern**

We’re looking for someone who’s excited to learn and grow while helping us build out our backend systems and streamline operations.

**You’ll get to:**

* Work directly with the founding team on building Fundora’s backend platform.
* Experiment with tools and frameworks to create smooth and scalable systems.
* Support core operations: artisan onboarding, product workflows, and market linkage.
* Gain real startup exposure — where ideas don’t sit in slides, they turn into reality fast.

**What’s in it for you?**

We know this is an unpaid role, but here’s what you’ll truly gain:

* Direct impact: Your work will lay the foundation for a brand that uplifts artisans across India.
* Hands-on learning: Forget “coffee runs” — you’ll be building real systems and solving real problems.
* Startup experience: Work side by side with founders in a dynamic, zero-to-one journey.
* Portfolio boost: Showcase your contributions in backend and operations to future employers or accelerators.
* Creative freedom: You’ll have room to experiment and bring your ideas into execution.
* Certificate of Experience: Official recognition of your contribution.
* Letter of Recommendation (LOR): Personalized, highlighting your impact.
* Priority consideration for future roles: As Fundora grows, interns will be considered first for permanent paid positions when vacancies open.

**Who should apply?**

* Students or fresh graduates who have worked on backend development and operations for e-commerce websites(college projects, freelance gigs, internships, or hackathons count).
* People who understand the basics of product listings, order management, payments, or inventory flows on the backend.
* Learners who can take ownership of small modules independently, but are also excited to experiment and learn by doing.
* Those who want to apply their e-commerce backend experience in building a new brand from scratch.",1,1758116840.0,StartUpIndia,0,1.0,False

She wrote me this LONG email (she is a therapist). I used ChatGPT to summarize it, it is still super long. Sharing it here in case it is useful to you. Also interested in if you agree with it or had anything to add to it.

Every fall, a wave of freshmen arrives on campus craving belonging. In theory, it should be easy to bond: hundreds of other newcomers share the same sense of disconnection and want friends just as badly. Yet many first-years report that forging those first connections feels surprisingly difficult. Understanding this paradox requires looking at both human evolution and everyday stress responses.

# Evolutionary Wiring Meets Modern Campus Life

For most of human history, survival depended on tight-knit groups. Separation from one’s tribe was dangerous, so our nervous systems evolved to read isolation as a life-threatening emergency. Even today, a freshman’s brain may register a dorm full of strangers as a wild landscape full of hidden predators. The result is the same ancient stress response: fight, flight, or freeze.

* **Freeze** looks like staying silent, scrolling on a phone, or avoiding eye contact—much like an ancestor crouching behind a bush hoping a lion passes.
* **Flight** might mean skipping events early, rushing out when class ends, or mentally checking out through substances or constant streaming.
* **Fight**, in its constructive sense, means pushing against those urges: walking into a club meeting, saying hello, or starting a small conversation.

# Body Language Tells the Story

Because 70–80 percent of communication is nonverbal, closed body language can create a self-reinforcing loop. Crossing arms, hunching over a laptop, or clutching a backpack protects vital organs—a survival reflex—but it also signals “don’t approach.” Others unconsciously read this and stay away, which deepens loneliness.

# Stress Isn’t Always “Bad”

Important life changes—planning a wedding, starting a dream job, or beginning college—still tax the nervous system. Naming the feeling (“I’m stressed because everything is new”) and noticing where it lives in the body (tight jaw, tense shoulders, sudden sleepiness) helps calm that alarm. Recognizing that stress doesn’t equal danger is the first step toward rewiring the brain for connection.

# The Power of Habituation

Fear fades with repeated, safe exposure. In a classroom, brief daily contact with the same peers slowly tells the brain, *These people are safe.* That comfort can then generalize to other settings—a study group, a coffee run, or a dorm hangout.

# A Farmer’s Mindset for Friendship

Imagine entering college the way a farmer enters a newly sprouting field. Every person you meet is a seed with potential. Your job is not to force growth but to create the conditions where connections can take root. A brief smile, a nod in class, a quick “How’s it going?”—each is like watering or adding sunlight. Some seeds germinate quickly and become strong friendships; others stay dormant or never grow. That isn’t failure. In farming, every seed receives the same early care even though not all will mature.

Farmers also know that growth is slow and seasonal. The ground must be prepared, the weather watched, and the crop revisited again and again. Likewise, friendships deepen through steady, repeated contact—sitting near someone in lecture week after week, studying together before exams, or sharing a meal when schedules align. Patience matters more than instant results. And just as a farmer thins weeds only after time reveals which plants will thrive, you can welcome everyone at first and let experience guide which relationships to nurture more deeply.

Approaching campus life this way takes the pressure off each interaction. You don’t need to know on day one who will become your closest friend. Instead, by consistently offering small acts of openness, you create a healthy social “field” where the best connections can naturally flourish.

**Takeaway:** The difficulty freshmen describe isn’t a sign of poor social skills; it’s the clash between ancient survival instincts and modern campus life. By recognizing stress as normal, monitoring body language, and taking small, repeated social risks, students can help their nervous systems catch up with their conscious desire for connection.",1,1758116714.0,BrownU,1,0.67,False

Two days ago i was so chill i felt high as a kite.

I also drink a shit ton of black tea and coffee lately, with a lot more cigarretes than usual, cause im an alcoholic and compensating for not being able to feel pleasure from booze on these meds.

I tested five different services this year (because apparently, I like to make things complicated) across the US, UK, CA, and FR channels. Here’s how they stacked up for me—no sales talk, just my own experience.

* * *

### **1\.** [**XXIPTV**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLPTV_SUB/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (less if you grab a longer [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://xxiptv.top/))
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (awesome for US/UK sports, plenty of CA/FR too)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (barely any buffering, even during busy US evenings)
    
*   **My experience:** I actually found XXIPTV through a US-based **iptv reseller** who raved about the NFL streams. I was skeptical, but after a week of switching between US talk shows, UK reality TV, and French news, it just… worked. The [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLPTV_provider/wiki/index/) option was super quick and didn’t ask for a ton of info. If you want reliability, this was my top pick.
    

* * *

### **2\.** [**IPTVMEZZY**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_Official_IPTV/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (good discounts for quarterly and yearly plans)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (huge variety for US, UK, CA, FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (solid overall, only a tiny bit of lag during big UK football matches)
    
*   **My experience:** IPTVMEZZY came up in a UK tech forum I follow. Their interface is simple, and I found some hidden gems in the Canadian lineup. Streams were crisp almost all the time—just a slight delay when everyone was tuning in for the same Premier League game. Great for bouncing between different regions.
    

* * *

### **3\.** [**Aurorastreaming**](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially strong for UK and FR, decent for US/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (most shows played perfectly, sports sometimes needed a quick refresh)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming was kind of an unexpected winner. Their VOD library for French and British classics is genuinely impressive. I did get a spinning wheel now and then during live UK rugby, but for regular shows and movies, it’s been a reliable backup.
    

* * *

### **4\.** [**StreamPilot TV**](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 21,000+ live, 68,000+ VOD (mainly US/UK/CA, smaller FR selection)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for news and series, but live sports can buffer at peak)
    
*   **My experience:** StreamPilot TV is my “simple and steady” pick. It’s perfect for US news, UK panel shows, and Canadian documentaries. French content is limited, but what’s there works fine. The sign-up process for their **iptv subscription 2025** was so simple I barely remember doing it.
    

* * *

### **5\. NovaVision IPTV**

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 15,000+ live, 47,000+ VOD (US/UK basics, a few CA/FR channels)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evenings brought some buffering, especially with live UK events)
    
*   **My experience:** NovaVision IPTV is my “background TV” choice. It’s great for catching up on older US sitcoms or UK news, but not really for the big live events. If you’re thinking of becoming an **iptv reseller**, their portal is easy to find, but I mostly just used it for casual background viewing.
    

* * *

**What I’ve Learned After My IPTV Binge**
-----------------------------------------

*   **Always go for the best iptv trial**—every provider feels different depending on your device, internet, and what you watch.
    
*   Don’t get dazzled by the channel count. Ask yourself what you’ll _actually_ watch (my own list: UK comedies, US news, and the occasional French thriller).
    
*   Even [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) services have the odd off night, especially during big live sports events in the US or UK.
    
*   If you ever want to be an [**iptv reseller**](https://xxiptv.top/), get ready for a lot of “why isn’t this channel working?” texts.
    
*   Seriously, use a VPN. It makes everything more secure (and sometimes even faster).",1,1758116643.0,TheAmpHour,0,1.0,False
1njdjrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Farhanamili/comments/1njdjrs/the_versatility_and_benefits_of_side_gusset/,The Versatility and Benefits of Side Gusset Pouches in Modern Packaging,"In today’s competitive retail and wholesale markets, packaging plays a crucial role in attracting consumers, preserving product quality, and offering convenience. Among the many packaging options available, the **side gusset pouch** has emerged as one of the most popular choices across industries. Known for its ability to maximize storage capacity while maintaining a compact footprint, the side gusset pouch is widely used in sectors ranging from coffee and tea to pet food, snacks, powders, and household essentials. This innovative pouch design combines strength, functionality, and aesthetic appeal, making it an ideal solution for brands seeking to enhance product visibility and performance on store shelves. Understanding the unique features and advantages of side gusset pouches can help businesses adopt smarter packaging strategies while meeting consumer demands for convenience and sustainability.

One of the key advantages of side gusset pouches lies in their **efficient structure and design**. The gussets, located on either side of the pouch, allow the package to expand when filled, thereby increasing volume capacity without taking up additional shelf space. This makes them a highly space-efficient packaging solution compared to traditional boxes or flat pouches. The flat bottom ensures the pouch can stand upright, creating a tidy and professional appearance on store shelves. Additionally, the design reduces unnecessary material usage, which not only lowers production costs but also contributes to sustainability goals. The ability to hold larger quantities while maintaining a neat presentation makes side gusset pouches particularly valuable for bulk products like coffee beans, protein powders, grains, and pet food. **For more:** [**Side Gusset Pouch**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-standard-bag-style/side-gusseted-pouch)

https://preview.redd.it/sujv8r3dbqpf1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5914fb9fd655789786a9b205b789b022573c643

Beyond structural benefits, side gusset pouches are also appreciated for their **durability and protective qualities**. Most of these pouches are manufactured using high-quality laminated films that provide excellent barrier protection against moisture, oxygen, UV light, and external contaminants. For products like coffee, which are sensitive to air exposure and require freshness to maintain flavor, side gusset pouches are often equipped with one-way degassing valves that allow gases to escape without letting oxygen in. This ensures longer shelf life and improved product integrity. Furthermore, the strong sealability of these pouches makes them resistant to tears and leaks, reducing the risk of product wastage during transportation or storage. Businesses benefit not only from reduced returns due to damaged packaging but also from maintaining consumer trust in product quality.

Another notable strength of side gusset pouches is their **versatility in branding and customization**. These pouches offer large printable surfaces on both the front and back panels, as well as the side gussets, providing brands with ample space to showcase logos, product details, nutritional information, and attractive graphics. Unlike rigid containers, which may have limited design flexibility, pouches can be easily customized with different finishes such as matte, glossy, or metallic. This adaptability allows brands to create eye-catching packaging that stands out on retail shelves and communicates their unique identity. Moreover, side gusset pouches can be produced in various sizes and colors, with features like resealable zippers, tear notches, or transparent windows to further enhance consumer convenience and product visibility. In a crowded marketplace, such customization options give businesses a competitive edge by directly appealing to consumer preferences.

Lastly, side gusset pouches are increasingly recognized for their **environmental benefits and cost-effectiveness**. With growing concerns over plastic waste and environmental impact, many manufacturers now offer eco-friendly side gusset pouches made from recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable materials. Compared to rigid packaging like cans or jars, pouches require less raw material and energy to produce, and their lightweight nature reduces transportation costs and carbon emissions. For businesses, this translates into significant savings while aligning with sustainability goals and consumer expectations for greener products. Consumers, on the other hand, benefit from packaging that is not only functional but also environmentally responsible. This dual advantage makes side gusset pouches a forward-thinking solution for brands seeking to balance performance, aesthetics, and sustainability in their packaging strategy.

In conclusion, the side gusset pouch represents a perfect blend of **functionality, durability, customization, and sustainability**. Its unique design maximizes space while preserving product freshness and integrity, making it suitable for a wide range of industries. Businesses benefit from cost savings and branding flexibility, while consumers enjoy convenience and eco-friendly packaging choices. As the packaging industry continues to evolve, side gusset pouches are set to remain a dominant and versatile option for companies aiming to enhance their market presence and deliver value to customers. By adopting side gusset pouches, brands can achieve the ideal balance of practicality and innovation in today’s highly competitive marketplace.",1,1758116626.0,u_Farhanamili,0,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Sensitivity with tooth that got a filling, noticed it on September 16, 2025

Stinging pain after drinking cold water, lasts for 30 seconds to a minute depending on how long I drink (i timed it)

Testing hot water sensitivity:
Mild ache but isn't painful unlike the sting from cold water. Lasts for about 30 seconds to a minute.

Doesn't hurt when I eat. The tooth had experienced a first filling that flopped, but was luckily noticed early before it caused any bigger damage.

Some extra info: I have like a level 5 pH acidity in my mouth and maybe that counts for something because google says that it's a cause for concern (I found out because I secretly took a silly little pH test from one of those pH paper strips that we needed to use for some chemistry experiments). I'm currently using Therabreath as a mouthwash since I learnt online that the pink one helps with cavities, which is something I've been suffering from since I was a child, also due to some really horrid mental health that made me a dysfunctional human lol. I'm in a much better place and realize that dental pain isn't worth it so I've been taking care of my teeth better the past few years. I take coffee every now and then when I need to pull an all-nighter, and I eat like a lot of bread and sweet things but I brush everyday because I'm scared of getting another molar plucked (can't afford root canal, and the risks make it so much more expensive). 

Family history: Dad's side got awful dental health.

Is this a possible cavity I should be worried about? I'm really nervous and sad, I've already had like 3 molars plucked out in the past 2 years and I feel horrible whenever a dentist sucks in a breath or like sigh when they ask for my age since I'm only 19 :((. 
The dentist that redid my filling was from my hometown, and I currently can't get it checked from their clinic because I'm in a different city for university. I don't feel like I can trust dentists here where I'm currently at because last time I got a filling, they didn't take out all the cavity which had to be redone back in my hometown, thankfully the tooth was still saved but is now starting to get sensitivity.

1njdff1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1njdff1/the_dreamwalker/,The Dreamwalker,"A sleepy Saturday in St. Somewhere. Market day. Bright stalls with fruit, toys, homemade fudge.

 

Pookie drifts through the crowd. His eyes half-focused, lips murmuring half-formed thoughts. To him, the world feels hazy, slowed, like walking through a half-remembered dream. He wanders into a hat stall, plops a giant sombrero on his head, and drifts off again without paying. He mistakes the fountain for a sink and starts washing his hands in it. A vendor asks if he’s okay, but Pookie just smiles: “Yeah… it’s like the clouds are talking.”

 

And then the real trouble. Pookie starts heading toward the busy street at the edge of the market, his steps unfaltering, eyes glazed.

 

Onlookers whisper: “Is he drunk?”

“No, he’s… oh lord, is that the Bubble Guy?”

 

Pookie steps off the curb… Spark barrels in, tail wagging and barking. He nudges Pookie back, circling like a furry lifeguard.

 

A bystander tries to grab Pookie roughly, the sombrero falls in the scuffle. Enter Captain Phil Oliver, who’d been at the market with a fishing basket. He swoops in, calm but firm.

 

Phil, in a voice that brokered no argument: “Let. Go. Now.”

 

 The bystander releases Pookie like he got caught stealing a cookie from the jar. Phil puts his frail arm around Pookie and guides him to sit on a bench.

 

Phil gives the surrounding crowd a scathing look: “He’s not drunk. He’s seizing. Give him space.”

 

The crowd quiets. Spark lays across Pookie’s lap, anchoring him. Slowly, the dreamy fog in Pookie’s eyes starts to lift.

 

Pookie, blinking, confused: “…Did I miss the parade?”

 

Phil chuckles: “No parade, kid. Just you stealing sombreros.”

 

The vendor walks up. She picks the sombrero off the ground where it fell. Instead of demanding money, she puts it back on Pookie’s head.

 

Vendor: “Keep it. Dreamwalkers need their crowns.”

 

The crowd has dispersed a little, though people still glance back at Pookie, Spark, and Captain Oliver. Pookie’s sombrero is slightly askew, his eyes still foggy. Phil is crouched over him from behind, grounding him with that steady hand-on-shoulder presence.

 

That’s when Anni shows up. Striding through the crowd like she owns the whole market. She’s got that “try me” energy in her step. She immediately clocks Pookie’s state, the tilted sombrero, Spark pressed tight against him.

 

Anni: “Pookie. What did we say about wandering off?”

 

Pookie with a lopsided grin and slightly dazed: “Parade was calling me, Anni. Gotta follow the trumpets.”

 

Phil, dry but kind: “Parade was a delivery truck. And you almost walked right into it.”

 

Anni crouches beside Pookie, putting herself at his eye level.

 

Anni softens: “Dreamwalking’s fine when you’ve got someone at your side. But when you’re alone? It’s dangerous, kid. You scared us.”

 

Pookie blinks slowly. “Didn’t mean to.”

 

Anni: “I know. That’s the thing! You don’t mean to. Which is why you let us help. That’s not weakness, Pook. That’s smart.”

 

Spark woofs in agreement, tail thumping. Baby Delta burps up a tiny, sparkly spore cloud that smells faintly like cinnamon.

 

Phil stands, arms crossed but smiling.

 

Phil: “We’ll make you a deal. We aren’t telling you not to go out. You gotta live. But no more solo parades. You always take Spark. Or Delta. Or better yet– me and Anni. Got it?”

 

Pookie, grinning again: “You’re like… my guardian devils.”

 

Anni laughs.

 

Oliver chuckles, tipping the sombrero so it sits square on Pookie’s head.

 

The three sit together on the bench a moment. Anni on one side, Phil on the other, Spark sprawled across Pookie’s lap, Baby Delta humming. A strange family, but his family.

 

Pookie: “…I love parades.”

 

Later that night at MOD HQ.

 

The vibe is calm. Music going, the smell of SailorMom’s cake drifts from the kitchen. Spark curled up on a beanbag. Pookie sits on the couch with a blanket around his shoulders, still a little foggy. Anni leans on the armrest, Phil is in a chair nearby. They are all sharing a Bowl. Caite comes in, clipboard under her arm. Notes scribbled everywhere.

 

Caite sits cross-legged on the coffee table, flipping a page: “Alright, Pookie. These “Dream Clusters” aren’t going away. But what we can do is give you anchors to keep you safe.”

 

Pookie squints at her. “Anchors? Like… pirate ship stuff?”

 

Phil puff, puffs before passing to Anni: “Exactly like pirate ship stuff.”

 

Caite: “First anchor: check-ins. Every time you go out, you text one of us. Just a dot. Or even a weird emoji. Doesn’t matter. Just proof you know where your phone is and we know you’re still upright. Find My Friends will do the rest.”

 

Anni: “And if you don’t check in, I’m sending Phil with the actual anchor from his boat.”

 

Pookie giggles. Spark woofs like he approves of this plan.

 

Caite turns the page: “Second anchor: Your medical alert bracelet. Start wearing it all the time even you you don’t mean to go out that day. You don’t get to choose when you have a seizure. And you don’t get to choose to wander around after either. So that will hopefully let people know what’s happening, even if you’re in your pajamas.”

 

 

Pookie hesitates, then nods. “…I can do that.”

 

Spark nudges his hand. Delta rustles her leaves happily.

 

Pookie, softly: “Thanks for not… y’know. Treating me like I’m incapable of thought.”

 

Anni: “That’s real Friendship, Pookie.”

 

Phil leans forward, voice steady: “A crew always looks after itself.”

 

Caite: “And we’ll keep adding anchors until you’re safe as houses.”

 

Pookie smiles: “…Best guardian devils ever.”",2,1758116324.0,Epilepsy_Universe,0,1.0,False
1njdf6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/officeland/comments/1njdf6d/why_your_back_hurts_after_2_hours_and_which/,Why Your Back Hurts After 2 Hours (And Which Office Chair Actually Fixes It),"You've probably noticed the pattern: morning coffee, productive first hour, then somewhere around 10:30 AM, that familiar ache creeps into your lower back. By lunch, you're shifting positions every few minutes. Sound familiar?

Here's what's actually happening to your spine—and more importantly, which specific chair features solve each problem.

# The 2-Hour Problem Nobody Talks About

Most office chair reviews focus on day-one comfort. But your body doesn't care about day one. The real test happens at hour two, when your postural muscles fatigue and your spine starts compensating in ways that create cascading problems.

When you first sit down, your core muscles naturally engage to maintain proper posture. But around the 90-120 minute mark, these muscles begin to fatigue. Your pelvis rotates backward, your lower back flattens, and suddenly you're putting 40% more pressure on your lumbar discs than you were an hour ago.

This isn't a willpower issue—it's biomechanics.

# The Three Critical Failure Points in Your Current Chair

# 1. Static Lumbar Support (The Comfort Trap)

That fixed lumbar cushion feels supportive initially, but it's actively working against you. Your spine naturally shifts throughout the day—about 2-3 cm of movement is normal. A static support forces your back into one position, causing your muscles to work harder to maintain alignment when your spine wants to move.

**What actually works:** Dynamic lumbar support that moves with you. Look for chairs with adjustable tension that allows controlled movement while maintaining support. The Herman Miller Embody and Steelcase Leap both excel here, though for different reasons I'll explain.

# 2. Seat Pan Depth Mismatch (The Hidden Culprit)

If there's more than a 2-3 finger gap between the seat edge and the back of your knees, or if the seat hits mid-thigh, you're forcing your pelvis into an unnatural position. This single factor causes more lower back pain than almost any other chair feature.

Most people never adjust seat depth because they don't know it matters. But a properly fitted seat pan maintains the natural curve of your spine without creating pressure points behind your knees.

**The measurement that matters:** Sit all the way back. You should be able to fit 2-3 fingers between the seat edge and your knee. Any more, and you lose back support. Any less, and you're cutting off circulation.

# 3. Armrest Float Zone (The Shoulder-Back Connection)

Your shoulders and lower back are connected through your thoracic spine. When armrests are too high, your shoulders elevate, creating tension that travels down your back. Too low, and your shoulders internally rotate, pulling your upper back forward and increasing pressure on your lumbar region.

The sweet spot: elbows at 90 degrees with shoulders completely relaxed. But here's what most guides miss—your armrests need to move with you as you shift positions throughout the day.

# The Chairs That Actually Solve These Problems (And Why)

# For Dynamic Workers: Steelcase Leap V2

The Leap's LiveBack technology mimics your spine's natural movement. As you shift positions, the backrest flexes to maintain consistent support without forcing you into a single posture.

**Why it works for 8+ hour days:** The seat edge is flexible, reducing pressure on your thighs even as you change positions. The natural glide system means the seat moves forward as you recline, maintaining that critical 2-3 finger gap automatically.

**Who shouldn't buy it:** If you're under 5'4"" or over 6'2"", the adjustment range might not accommodate your proportions optimally. Also, if you prefer a firm, stable seat, the flexibility might feel unsettling initially.

# For Sustained Focus Work: Herman Miller Aeron (Remastered)

The Aeron's PostureFit SL targets both your sacrum and lumbar region—the only chair that properly supports the S-curve at both critical points. The pellicle mesh eliminates pressure points entirely, which matters more than you'd think after hour four.

**The overlooked advantage:** The forward tilt option. When you're leaning into focused work, this 5-degree tilt maintains your spinal alignment while allowing you to engage with your desk naturally.

**The real limitation:** The mesh can feel cold in winter, and some find the frame edges noticeable when sitting cross-legged or in alternative positions.

# For Mixed Sitting/Standing: Herman Miller Cosm

If you use a standing desk part-time, the Cosm's auto-harmonic tilt is game-changing. It automatically adjusts to your weight and posture without manual controls, making transitions between sitting and standing seamless.

**The engineering insight:** The leaf arms and dipped seat edge accommodate multiple sitting positions—critical if you shift between focused work and collaborative video calls throughout the day.

**The tradeoff:** Limited manual adjustability. If you prefer fine-tuning every aspect of your chair, this isn't for you.

# The Setup Sequence That Prevents Pain

The best chair poorly adjusted is worse than a decent chair properly configured. Here's the exact sequence:

1. **Start with seat height:** Feet flat on floor, knees at 90-100 degrees
2. **Adjust seat depth:** That 2-3 finger gap behind your knees
3. **Set backrest height:** Lumbar support should hit between L3-L5 vertebrae (about belt level)
4. **Position armrests:** Shoulders relaxed, elbows at 90 degrees
5. **Fine-tune tilt tension:** Should support you but allow movement with minimal effort

Test this configuration for 30 minutes before making further adjustments. Your body needs time to adapt to proper support.

# The Investment Logic Most People Miss

A $1,500 chair sounds expensive until you calculate the actual cost. Over five years of remote work (10,000+ hours), that's 15 cents per hour of use. Compare that to the average cost of physical therapy for chronic back pain: $350 per session, typically requiring 8-12 sessions.

But here's the real calculation: productivity loss from discomfort. If back pain reduces your focus by just 10% for two hours daily, you're losing 500 productive hours annually.

# What Actually Matters After 1,000 Hours

After extensive use, three factors separate great chairs from good ones:

**Material resilience:** Mesh stretches, foam compresses, but quality materials maintain 90%+ of their support after year one. Cheap chairs lose 40% of their cushioning in the same period.

**Mechanism durability:** The cylinder, tilt mechanism, and adjustment controls take thousands of micro-adjustments. Premium chairs use steel components where others use plastic.

**Warranty reality:** Herman Miller's 12-year warranty and Steelcase's 10-year coverage aren't marketing—they're engineering confidence. Local furniture store chairs typically offer 1-2 years for a reason.

# Your Next Action (Based on Your Actual Situation)

**If you're buying your first serious office chair:** Start with the Steelcase Leap V2. It's forgiving of adjustment errors and works well for most body types and working styles.

**If you have existing back problems:** Consult a physical therapist first, but the Herman Miller Aeron with PostureFit SL addresses most common lumbar issues better than any other option.

**If your budget is under $500:** The IKEA Järvfjället with armrests or a refurbished Steelcase Amia offers 70% of the benefit at 30% of the cost. Focus on getting seat depth and lumbar height right.

**If you're not ready to buy:** Improve your current setup with a lumbar roll (positioned at L4), a footrest if needed, and set a timer to stand and stretch every 45 minutes.

# The Bottom Line

Your back hurts because your chair fails at one of three critical support points, usually after your postural muscles fatigue around the two-hour mark. The solution isn't just buying an expensive chair—it's understanding which specific features address your particular failure points and setting them up correctly.

The right chair, properly adjusted, should feel almost invisible after 15 minutes. If you're constantly aware of your chair—through discomfort or excessive comfort—something's wrong with your setup.

Remember: the best chair is the one that fits your body, supports your work style, and maintains your spine's natural curves through an entire workday. Everything else is marketing.",1,1758116308.0,officeland,0,1.0,False

Made another $1.5k just yesterday.

I even have 2 people pending wanting my personalized help, so I saved a spot for them towards the end of the month.

All by building a [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool) community around my passion.

https://preview.redd.it/xb89wt3kvkpf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=471d63737dc590fff9c3cc16c47168abe8cdcc5a

I was able to quit my job, move to Miami with no plan b & live on my own terms.

How did I do it, you might ask?

I went all in.

Here's the simple truth:

We can have the BEST coffee machine in our kitchen, but if we don't make the coffee, we won't be able to drink it.

So here's how I was able to quit my 9-5 job & go full-time with a community

\---my story--

About 1.5 years ago, I was going to college, and I started taking self-improvement seriously. I became disciplined, which helped me consume the right type of content.

The problem:

* Spending time in a bunch of jobs that drained me (lifeguard, personal trainer, fragrance sales specialist & soccer coaching)
* ""Forced"" to go to class, learning from people who haven't even done the thing I want
* Had a passion, couldn't make money

I even took an entrepreneurship class (in college), but I didn't learn anything that would get me results. At that time, that was the only class I would show up to because my teacher was pretty & would give me blueberries in class 💯

Then I discovered [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool) on YouTube

This allowed me to learn from people who've solved the problem I had.

After spending time learning, I felt something inside build up...

It was a belief

I started an online fitness coaching business & got my first client! Then I dropped out of college because it showed me what was possible on the other side.

I kept doing that, then pivoted over time

3.5 months ago, I quit my job & went all in. I had $5k in the savings, flew across U.S to Miami, didn't have a place to stay for 3 days, so I stayed at my client's place for 3 days, almost went homeless, no car, no offer, no money from my business, just complete undertiny.

Also, thankful that Sam Ovens made skool have such low fees, which made it possible for me to keep my community running even though there were times when I had less than $1000 in the bank....

One thing I knew for a fact was if I lived like the version of me who already had what I wanted, then reality would correct itself over time with execution.

Then I invested in a mentorship, using a credit card & maxed it out because I didn't have any money.

I was able to monetize my passion & create my reality.

1st day got a paying client in my community

Then the momentum started building up

2,3,4,5,6... & so on

From getting these results, I realized these 3 things were the main pillars that allowed me to do so

**Crafting an offer** 

EX: I help \[XYZ\] achieve \[dream outcome\] in \[timeframe\] using \[unique thing\]

Note: This was super valuable because in the beginning, I wanted to help everyone. But I learned that less = more. So even though I've helped all different types of entrepreneurs, coaches, 7-8 figure business owners etc... I decided to niche down & help online fitness coaches.

**Attract: Networking with dream clients**

Note: I learned that this was the biggest problem that was stopping me from monetizing. Back in the day, I would focus more on optimizing my offer, creating a course, and worrying about future problems that didn't even exist! So instead, once I put all my energy towards monetizing my passion, more was achieved.

**Convert: Turning those conversations into clients**

Note: I started to wake up to messages like ""what are the next steps"" & tons of DM's from my dream clients, so I got them to book a call so I can have a conversation with them which allowed me to see if I can actually help them or not. I would say no to people who weren't a good fit & yes to people who are.

I knew how to deliver great results; the only problem was being clear on my offer & letting people know that I existed

I already had pretty good results & testimonials from my beta clients. So once I fixed those things, I was able to make money & replace my 9-5 income with my [skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool) community.

You've probably seen results of people hitting $100k/m etc.. it might feel overwhelming. That's why for beginners, I believe if you're able to even get your first client & hit your first $5-10k/m it can be life-changing.

Because it was for me.

It's like a domino effect; once you get your first client, build up that momentum, it changes everything.

I wanted to post this in hopes that no matter what the situation, I believe if you put your energy towards the right things, results will be inevitable.

Even if you're working 3 jobs at once, even if you think you don't have money to invest in resources, etc...

The universe is a reflection of you. When I smile at a random person who's walking by the street they smile back.

The same concept worked when I went all in.

1njddzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Freedom/comments/1njddzo/what_is_the_goal_of_life/,what is the goal of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Hear me out? It's very long, I apologize in advance for the length.

Context, Me (26F) live with my parents, and 2 brothers. Our youngest (21M) has depression and self harms with a penknife. Mom found him doing so about 6 years ago and at first, all of us were patient and tried to talk with him. Now though, my other brother and I are tired of this.

I distinctly recall the day my family found out. That day, Mom called me 5 minutes before one of my uni exams. I remember sitting outside the testing hall and getting a call from my mom who was working from home. She told me. ""Hi... I just found out <name> was cutting himself. Did you know?"" Obviously I flunk that exam (I was on a scholarship so yes, my grades mattered a lot) and I've held a grudge in my heart since then at my mom. Not that I've let it show. 

Since then, he's been seeing a therapist and getting meds. There were a few months of school refusal too and he didn't do well for major exams. So Mom and dad paid for him to attend a well known local private university. When he said, he wanted to go to a gym and leanr MMA, they also paid yearly memberships for him to attend 2 seperate gyms which he goes to about thrice a month. 

On our end at home, my family and I constantly tried inviting him out to to the gym, to karaoke, to cafes etc etc. Sometimes, he agreed and tried to participate. Sometimes, he would agree then refuse to get out of bed on the day of. Sometimes, he would say no.

It looked like he was improving for a while. Then 3 years ago, he got an online girlfirend (they've never met in person, she's in a very VERY far off country). They online dated for a year or so then broke up. It went downhill from there.

Nowadays, if he goes out with the family, he has the most sullen look on his face most of the time. He cancels on people and appointments without warning  (no message, no heads up) and if people ask him where he was, he replies ONE DAY AFTER the appointment to say ""breakup"" (mind you, this is 1 years after the breakup). 

The part I'm most upset at though is how much more my parents will do for him everytime he is even the slightest bit upset. Not eating much food? Mom orders him 2 or 3 menu items on Grab to choose from. He eats one then throws the rest by the sink. Then orders Starbucks on Grab right after. Want to start a hobby? Parent buy him a coffee machine and all the tools needed. I've bought him an instrument and makeup too when he showed an interest. Refusing to attend uni classes? It's okay, they're not going to push in case he self harms again. They keep telling me to check on him too or pass messages to him because he never picks up his phone or reads messages. ""We're out at ____, can you ask <name> if he wants anything from here?"" And when I do go to his room to ask, he's playing games on his desktop most of the day.

He recently cut himself again so Mom's kept the penknives again. Dad keeps coming to my room to tell me he's lonely and that I should talk to him more (<name> hasn't spoken to me for a few weeks and all the messages I send him on WA get blue ticked). Last night, Mom and Dad were so tense they raised their voices just packing a cupboard together. I'm so tired of all this.

I don't have much knowledge in the realm of dating and am pretty sheltered in experience.

Last week I met ""Tom"" another student in one of my classes, we got along well and has some pretty good banter. The following day Tom had asked to ""hangout"" and through my interpretation I had perceived it as a friendship kind of hangout. I saw him later during that day, and he was quite touchy with me, and I was a little shocked as I don't have many male friends and didn't know if this was normal. An old friend saw the two of us and approached me, telling me about the time they had gone out together during their first year of college. Everything was fine but they clashed pretty badly, having opposing political views, life goals, and expectations of dating. That friend had told me that Tom was quite clingy, I really should have listened to her warning.

Going back to my student accomodation that day, he asked me out. I politely declined as I was ill, and brushed him off. I did like his personality at the time, however him having gone out with a good friend of mine was a complete turn off. Over roughly the next five days, he had asked me out four times, each with a different date idea that I either brushed off or declined because I didn't like the situation.

We share a common lecture, and have a very similar campus schedule. I had deflected the date asks and suggested that we get a bite or coffee during our break. When I got to campus, I had this churning feeling in my stomach, and he had asked for where I was and came to my friend and I. My friend knew that I was uneasy, and that I felt like he was being too pushy, so she stayed by me. He made a really immature joke about Thailand and it had rubbed me the wrong way, I was convinced that I didn't want to see him. I avoided him the whole day, having a few friends on lookout as I had other things to do but I did have time to grab a coffee.

A close friend that I had shared my unease to asked if he knew my name. I though this was a stupid question because how can you ask me out four times, over Instagram and still not know my name?! She urged me to ask him, and just see where it went.

When it came time for our shared lecture, I sat with my table group as per usual, and he came and sat directly next to me publicly announcing it. I wanted to die, everyone was looking at us and I made him move to the table across me. My table mates were uncomfortable as fuck as he kept kind of bouncing in his seat, very obviously staring at me and making it his mission to respond to everything I said, even if it wasn't directed towards him. In this moment I asked him if he knew my name, he said no! Claiming it was hard to pronounce and remember - my name is not hard to pronounce or remember, it's fairly common. My whole table went what the fuck, including myself. On our way out, he pushed past one of my girlfriends and walked beside me, I told him he was moving way too fast and needed to slow down. He looked offended and just walked off to find another friend of his. All my friends are beyond invested in this shit-show and all agree that I should block him.

Today, I had another lecture on campus and I saw him. I had avoided all of his messages, not responding on Instagram, as I wanted to firmly communicate my boundaries and wishes to him today. I waved at him and he ignored me, then during my lecture spammed my phone with messages asking why I was ignoring him.

The people who sit around me were so invested they offered to write me a paragraph that was along the lines of 'I want to be friends, and we are not on the same wavelength right now'. I sent the message and he responded with some pick me bullshit saying that he's 'really cringey and that he was only trying to be nice but I'm overreacting, etc'.

I ignored his messages for the next few days and somehow he didn't get the memo,  he kept sending me odd reels again. I avoided him like the plague on campus, and during our shared lecture I sat with my table and avoided talking and eye contact with him. I removed him on my Instagram too, so far we haven't spoken in person yet and I'd like to keep it that way.

My main concern is that he doesn't understand social situations, I have this gut feeling that I can't shake off. I feel like he could become violent or aggressive for some reason. For reference I'm roughly 170cm tall and weigh 65kgs and he's 187cm tall and weighs 90kgs (not fat, mostly muscle mass he does boxing and weight training). He also hangs out with people who give me the wrong vibe. I believe that peoples friend groups are a reflection of themselves, I think he is either incredibly stupid or putting on a facade because these friends of his don't match the persona he portrays to me at all.

I just don't know what to do, please i appreciate all kinds of advice. I need some new perspectives surrounding this situation!",4,1758115948.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I'm 26 yo, a woman, and 1,65 m for 66 kg.

I've been trying to lose weight so my doctors take me seriously and treat me better (I have several chronic conditions, and doctors like to accuse my weight even though I'm not overweight even according to their sacred BMI).

For that, I've been tracking my calories religiously to make sure I'm in a deficit, on top of all my exercise, including biking everyday which I already did (one of the only forms of exercise that is actually good for me, not allowed to run because of my knees and can't walk much because of POTS among other things)

However after more than 2 months of a 500+ calorie deficit, my weight hasn't budged at all. I know for most people it means they're not tracking something, oil/butter, drinks, aso, I see it often in posts here. But I'm tracking all the butter and oil I'm using, all the drinks (even coffee with 0 cal sweetener and no sugar drinks so that's telling you !) and weighing everything. I'm autistic and that at least makes me super meticulous about that sort of thing.

So I was wondering if you guys could help me figure out what it could be that's messing up my tracking ? Or if I should look into a problem health wise preventing me from losing weight.

Some more background : 
I used to weigh 40 kg in 2022, had always been super thin no matter how much I ate, but then I put on 30 kg in 2 weeks because of a medication.

My maintenance I've calculated at 1,967 (I might have understimated my exercise, but better that way around !)
So I was aiming for 1,467 calories
My average the past month has been 1,430 and the one before 1,387 tracking everything that goes in my mouth (or at least I think so...)

But that should be a 500+ deficit (maybe even more with my exercise ?) and I first gained 200g, then lost 100g, nothing else.

Exercise wise I do each week :
3 times 45 min to 1 hour physio sessions
2 intense 30 min cardio sessions on a stationary bike
Stationary bike everyday at least 5 km
And then gentle exercise at home

Sorry if that was a bit long, thank you in advance for any help figuring out a potential issue on my tracking (or otherwise helping me know I gotta look towards something health-related), I appreciate it !",1,1758115698.0,loseit,9,0.57,False

1njd5ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1njd5ub/friendships_and_initiating_straight_guys/,"Friendships and initiating, straight guys","Hey guys. I (33M) have always struggled making male friends, or mates as we say in Australia. I am gay, but don’t really fit in with other gay guys. I’m not into loud and proud, activist types, and I’ve upset quite a few gay guys in my life because of my direct demeanour. 
Most of my friends are women. I find it so easy to talk with women. 

Emotionally unavailable father and a ‘feminine upbringing’, the gay thing, not having similar interests as most straight men, I would think are the main reasons why connections with other men (particularly straight men) are difficult for me. And I accept that. For me to vibe with a straight guy it would be a rare occurrence because common interests are (almost) everything when it comes to forming male bonds. The annoying thing is, is that I usually vibe well with most straight guys because I love banter and can make conversation light and humorous.

At work, I’m one of the organisers in our social club. I can talk with anyone at work, even strike up the small talk with other male coworkers. I have a few male coworkers that I catch up for coffee with. However it tends to end up being me always initiating. And this is usually the case if I’ve met a guy outside of work - they don’t mind my company (even with the dissimilar interests), but I always initiate the catch up. And I genuinely mean I know they enjoy my company, because at work for example they’ll always greet me, stop for a chat willingly and keep me away from my desk for a while, remember things I’ve told them etc
And the conversations flow. 
Outside of work, I’ve joined clubs, doing regular things, Bumble BFF etc. but I always run into this initiator loop, and the other guy saying he really enjoyed our catch up when we do…but we all know it will be me sending that text months later to organise the next one. 
I even pick activities because I know most men like doing something talking ‘shoulder to shoulder’.

Men tend to open up to me, even without me steering the convo into that space, which I suspect they can’t do this with other guys, or rely on their wives. I’m fine with this, but it’s an interesting dynamic, that I’ll be their shoulder to lean on, but I’ll never cross into that friend inner circle. I accept this too. 

I guess my frustration if I can call it that is I don’t mind playing the initiator role, but it does get tiring. And I get tired of never ‘fitting in’ with the bros. I’m not looking to be some guy’s best friend, because this is highly unlikely. But I would just like to know what it feels like to meet a guy who can match me in willingness to initiate. 

Because I feel like an ‘outsider’, I want to know what goes through your heads if you are also straight? Do you think it’s weird to reach out to another guy who isn’t a part of your inner circle? Do you prefer another guy playing the initiator so you don’t have to? Do you just send memes back and forth - then someone takes it for the team and says, hey wanna come over to watch X sport? Does that happen as they say? Is it as simple as guys like doing a regular sport or whatever with each other, and that is the ‘socialising’? So if that stops, the friendships die? Help a brother understand. I’m being a tad facetious. I just want to understand the male psyche more so I can adapt.
Any advice beyond they are just busy, have other priorities, aren’t into making new friends, don’t you know things cost a lot of money when you’re out these days etc would be appreciated. 

I know guys have their friends they’ve known for a while and even if they lose touch for years, they can pick up where they left off etc which is great. This is where I would struggle because I’m used to the ‘feminine’ way of keeping in touch - I’ve learned that guys don’t need to constantly message to maintain a friendship. 
I do realise that my ‘issue’ could also be that most people are not natural born initiators. It’s ‘normal’ to not want to play that role, I can accept that I’m not the norm. 

I should say I used to be a full on introvert. But I learned how to be social in the last few years because connections are everything. And I’ve reflected and been like was this worth it, and should I just be a full on introvert again lol 
Thanks for the long rant and for reading, look forward to hearing your thoughts.

A bit about myself: I'm a gentleman of 24. I'm interested in reading! I love classical literature! Shakespeare is honestly amazing! I also enjoy reading Charles  Dickins, a favorite of mine! But I also enjoy fiction and non-fiction! The Jungle of Stone, by William Carson is one of my favorite biographies!

Outside of literature, I enjoy creating art and music! I love to draw and to use methods of drawing that I can create myself. The mediums I work most with are, vine charcoal and pyrography (wood burning). 

I play two instruments, the fiddle and the concertina! I am not completely proficient in either, but I can play a few songs without sounding horrid!

I also enjoy going on walks and enjoying nature! One of my favorite pastimes is to walk and simply enjoy what I'm seeing.

I am very big into indepth conversations! I love to ask deep questions and genuinely get to know my friends and myself. 

Things I'm not interested in: video gaming, anime, horror film genre, sexism, homophobia, racism.

If all of this appeals to you, feel free to reach out directly! We'll chat and if I don't really feel we have too much in common to continue as friends, I'll tell you directly. No ghosting involved! ",1,1758115598.0,Needafriend,1,0.67,False

What are other small little things we could start doing? There was a moment where we got a cooking book and started making recipes off of that on Sundays, maybe I could revive that tradition.

1njd01t,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1njd01t/oneel_the_impossible_place_part_1/,One’el – The Impossible Place (Part 1),"I was only thirteen that afternoon, September 17, 2007.  
I remember it clearly — I was in the living room, playing videogames, while my sisters played in the yard. The sound of their laughter always filled the house — until, suddenly, everything stopped.  
The silence was so abrupt it chilled my chest.

I ran into the yard.  
Nothing.  
No sign of them.  
I called, I shouted, I circled the house. My heart was pounding so hard it hurt. I called my parents, who were in the kitchen, and soon the whole neighborhood seemed to know something terrible had happened.

The police were called, but what came after marked me forever. The “investigation” was lukewarm, almost performative. Vague questions, shallow searches. I was young, but not stupid — I realized something was being hidden. It was as if no one really wanted to find out what had happened.

Then Matthew, an old family friend and sergeant at the Hollow Creek police department, came to us. He was the only one who looked my father in the eye and said:  
— “You need to leave here. Now.”

Three days later, we were in another town.  
But even far away, my sisters’ voices found me.  
In the hush of the nights, I heard them whispering a single name:

“One’el… One’el…”

For years I lived with that sound in my head. I grew up, became an adult, and began to investigate. I sifted through archives, wrote letters to former Hollow Creek residents, and hunted for records no one wanted to show me.

In August 2017, I got a reply. An envelope with no return address contained only an old map of Hollow Creek. At its center a red dot marked something that no longer existed on GPS — an entire road erased from digital records.  
On the back, a short handwritten line:

“There resides what you seek.”

That night something changed inside me.  
I spent the following months gathering information and preparing. I bought flashlights, provisions, and a simple pistol. I knew I would not find only answers.

On the afternoon of November 12, 2017, I arrived at the edge of the forgotten road at exactly 7:00 p.m. I stopped the car, shut off the engine, and the night silence felt heavier there: cold air, trees folding into green tunnels, the yellowed map on the passenger seat. I thought I was alone — but I wasn’t. A figure leaned against the rusted gates: Matthew.

He had been there before me, old as ever, wearing a worn coat and a cap pulled low. New lines etched his face. When we approached, he didn’t smile.  
— “You didn’t have to come at night,” he said bluntly. “Why now? I thought you’d buried it.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat and told him about the map, the letters, the dreams. I spoke quickly, as if time were pushing me back to that day in 2007. Matthew listened in silence, his hand near his holster, his eyes hard.

He shook his head.  
— “You don’t understand the whole thing. There are things the town preferred to bury with the dust. Files disappeared, statements were ‘lost,’ and those who pressed too hard received looks that say more than words — and then they vanished. I tried to protect you. I protected your parents.”

— “You protected us by uprooting our lives with no explanation?” I replied, voice louder than I meant. “I needed to know. I need to know!”

Matthew breathed deeply and, for a moment, put aside the old police cynicism. His eyes seemed heavy with decades of secrets.  
— “I know,” he admitted. “I know how much it hurts. And I know the police failed. Partly out of fear, and partly… because of worse things. I can’t tell you everything. Not here. But there are signs, things that repeat: rituals, people who show up and then disappear, looks that never forget.”

He paused, staring at the road that led to the orphanage. — “There’s a reason this place was erased from history,” he said quietly. — “Be smart and stay away. Your sisters are dead.”

The blow landed hard. Everything I had been holding onto — hope, the search — trembled. Still, something in me didn’t give up. Matthew saw that. He put a hand on my shoulder, a gesture that had comforted us for years.  
— “If you go,” he said with a sigh, “I’ll stay close. I can’t do more, but I won’t leave you alone in this.”

I didn’t argue. I couldn’t. I stowed the map, adjusted my pack, and drove down the road. Matthew stayed, a still figure beside the gates. The road swallowed my car as I drove the last shaded meters. Trees bowed over the asphalt, bushes scraping the paint. It felt as though everything were intent on hiding the way.

When I finally saw the rusted gates, I noticed the orphanage: filthy, utterly ruined, choked with vegetation. Flaking walls, broken windows, trees sprouting in the courtyard. The building exhaled abandonment, as if time itself had tried to swallow it.  
I pushed the gate. The metal groaned — a long sound that felt like a warning.

The impossible happened.  
Inside, the sun was shining. Trees were lit, the walls looked clean, and children ran and laughed around the yard.  
By instinct I checked my watch again: it still read night. Outside the world remained dark, but inside there was a clear afternoon.

Every bone in me begged to run. But I didn’t run.  
I felt something different — a strange calm. It was as if I knew the place. As if my life had roots there, buried beneath every brick. The more I looked, the more that feeling grew: I wasn’t just a visitor. I had once belonged to One’el.

Then I noticed: there was only one adult. No teachers, no staff, no caretakers.  
Only her: the headmistress.

— “Come in, my dear. You look tired. I made fresh coffee. There are biscuits.”

The warm smell flooded my nostrils. My body obeyed something larger. I found myself seated at the table, the steaming cup before me.  
— Why am I doing this? I don’t even like coffee, I thought.

Looking past her, I saw the narrow corridor that ended in an ancient door with a yellow sign: “DO NOT ENTER.”  
— “Not all doors are for you,” she said, eyes bright. “Nothing good awaits on the other side.”

The children’s laughter was identical to my sisters’ — the exact rhythm, repeated endlessly. My stomach turned.  
I checked the watch. 11:41 p.m.  
It made no sense. In my head I had been there only ten minutes.

I stood and began to walk down the corridor. But something was wrong. The corridor didn’t follow a straight line. Each step seemed to lead me to a different part of the building. The walls curved in impossible ways; stairs appeared then vanished as I approached. Doors materialized and dissolved, some open, some locked, but none led to anywhere I could recognize.

Shadows danced on the walls, lengthening and shrinking as if breathing. The floor creaked beneath my feet, but the sounds seemed to come from different directions at once. Small drafts cut my face though I was inside, and childish laughter echoed from corners that didn’t exist. A door that should have opened onto the dining hall now revealed a corridor that ended in a wall overgrown with ivy.

I ran my hands along the walls to guide myself. The wallpaper peeled away to reveal ancient marks, scratches, symbols drawn in red that pulsed faintly as I neared. Each corridor felt like a living labyrinth, changing as I advanced, trying to confuse and trap me.

For a moment I thought I was walking in circles. When I glanced at a window, the trees and the courtyard were always at the same distance. Nothing made sense, but an invisible force led me — slow, insistent — until finally I saw the old door with the yellow sign: “DO NOT ENTER.”

A chill crawled up my spine. I stood there a long time, watching the door. It made no sense, the path I’d taken to get here.  
Why did it feel familiar?  
Why hadn’t I run when everything felt wrong?

After all these years — almost every day hearing my sisters’ voices — something told me I was near the answer. At the same time I felt I would pay a price for this decision. I tried to silence my racing thoughts, gathered the little courage I had left, and pushed the door.

Chapter 1 – Between Classes and Shadows:

The bell rang.

A sharp, metallic clang that signaled the end of third period — and another fake smile Marcus Blackwood would have to wear for forty-seven minutes straight.

He slipped his headphones off and let them hang around his neck. Music still played softly — low, moody rap with a deep kick drum and lyrics about power, loss, and keeping your guard up. Pretty fitting, honestly.

He moved through the crowded hallway of Greyson Heights Academy like a ghost, tall and quiet, dodging half-hearted hellos and awkward shoulder bumps from kids who knew his name but not much else. He kept his uniform neat — black blazer, tie slightly loosened, shoes polished just enough — but he never looked comfortable in it. Not really.

“Yo, Marcus!” a voice called behind him.

He stopped, slowly turning as a lanky kid jogged up beside him, balancing a tablet in one hand and a protein bar in the other.

“Hey, man,” said **Juno Park**, grinning wide. “You finish that econ worksheet? I swear Carter’s trying to fail us.”

Marcus nodded, indifferent. “Yeah. It was just data manipulation. Took like ten minutes.”

“Cool, cool… genius mode activated,” Juno laughed, then dropped his voice. “Also, side note, I think Ms. Darnell is actually an AI. I watched her blink once during a quiz and the lights flickered.”

Marcus almost smiled.

Almost.

Before he could reply, a girl with a pixie cut and a denim jacket covered in pins fell into step beside them. **Tessa Vance.** Sharp eyes, sharper tongue.

“Blackwood,” she said. “Are you ghosting the debate team again?”

“Was I ever *on* the debate team?” Marcus asked without looking at her.

“We had you down as a maybe. You ghosted two meetings and didn’t answer the group chat.”

“I don’t answer *any* group chats,” he said flatly.

Juno gave Tessa a helpless shrug. “Dude’s an enigma.”

“He’s something,” she muttered.

The three of them walked the final stretch of hallway in near silence, footsteps echoing off the polished tile. Marcus didn’t mind their company — it was better than the empty silence he usually waded through — but it always felt like he was only halfway present. He wasn’t like them.

He didn’t get to *be* like them.

The classroom smelled like old markers, overheated electronics, and barely cleaned projectors. Marcus took his usual seat in the back corner — not because he was a slacker, but because it gave him the clearest line of sight to the door, windows, and every exit point in the room.

Paranoia? Maybe.  
Necessary? Definitely.

Mr. Carter, a wiry man with a tired voice and a coffee addiction, started droning about market forces and long-term investment trends. Marcus tuned him out after five seconds.

Instead, he tapped the underside of his desk, where a tiny magnetic strip held a second screen — a foldable, low-glow HUD Lena had helped him design.

It flickered on silently, displaying a feed of the city grid. One part of his brain tracked Carter’s voice for any change in tone — the other scanned for flagged activity around Noxhaven.

Ping.  
**Unknown vehicle drop at Dock 17. No ID. No manifest.**

His pulse jumped slightly. He zoomed in. Three heat signatures. Cargo van. Shortwave radio interference. Definitely not legal.

His wrist buzzed, and he casually adjusted the cuff of his blazer.

Lena’s voice crackled into his ear.

>

He muttered back under his breath, just loud enough for the mic in his collar to pick up: “Dock 17. Arms drop?”

>

“Wasn’t planning on staying this long.”

>

>

“Mr. Blackwood?” Carter’s voice cut through the air.

Marcus blinked.

Half the class was staring at him. His screen flicked off instantly. He met the teacher’s gaze without flinching.

“Yes, sir?”

“I asked if you'd like to explain why diversified portfolios reduce risk over time.”

Marcus didn’t hesitate. “Because spreading investments across unrelated markets minimizes exposure to sector-specific volatility and balances long-term performance.”

A few students let out quiet “whoas.” Tessa raised an eyebrow.

Mr. Carter nodded. “Correct. Next time, answer the first time I ask.”

Marcus nodded, expression unreadable.

After class, he walked toward the back gate of the school, alone now. Juno had detention for playing beats on the school PA system. Tessa had a club meeting. And Marcus? He had a city to clean.

Back at the penthouse, the sun was already dipping behind the skyline, casting gold across the glass towers. He stood silently at the floor-to-ceiling window, unbuttoning his uniform shirt. The city blinked at him — towers, lights, traffic — all pretending to be peaceful.

It wasn’t.

He opened the hidden wardrobe behind a bookshelf. His suit waited there — matte black, armored, and silent.

He stepped into it like second skin.

The wrist module synced. Mask down. HUD online. The city map lit up. Target confirmed.

Lena came on the line again.

>

“Already on my way.”

He stood on the edge of the balcony, 130 floors above the world. Wind tugged at his hood, but he didn’t feel it.

Down below, people played at normal. Dinners. Homework. Group chats.

But not him.

He wasn’t Marcus Blackwood anymore.

Not up here.

Up here, he was only one thing.

**Suxvona.**

Marcus exhaled slowly, his body tense but controlled as he crouched behind a stack of shipping containers near Dock 17. The night air was thick with salt and oil, the faint smell of fish mixing with rust and machinery. The faint hum of cargo cranes and distant ship horns filled the dock, but the three men in front of him were all business — moving crates without a care for the eyes watching.

His visor flicked softly, overlaying thermal readings and a street-level map with the movement of the targets. Lena’s voice whispered quietly in his ear through the earpiece.

“Targets are armed, Marcus. Standard sidearms, but there’s a drone in play. Look out for its signal.”

Marcus nodded inside the suit, eyes locked on the middle man — a bulky figure loading a case into the van.

The van’s sliding door closed with a metallic *clang*, and the three men climbed in. Marcus’s heart rate picked up; this was the moment.

He pulled a compact grappling hook from his utility belt and fired it with practiced precision onto the top of the container nearest the van. The line hummed tight as he scaled up silently, the dark suit muffling every movement.

From above, he could see the van’s license plate — fake, no registry. The cargo crates stacked inside were marked with alien symbols, which his suit’s AI identified as black-market arms dealer tags.

A smirk crossed his lips beneath the mask.

The city might have forgotten to fear the night, but he hadn’t.

Marcus dropped silently behind the van just as it started rolling forward.

“Dock security cameras? Blacked out for five minutes. Good timing,” Lena said.

“Thanks,” Marcus replied.

He pulled a small EMP pulse from his wrist and lobbed it beneath the van. The device emitted a low hum and then a sharp pulse that knocked the van’s engine dead.

The van stopped abruptly, headlights flickering out.

From inside, the driver cursed, and the other two men scrambled for weapons.

Marcus was faster.

He darted out from the shadows, a flash of black cloth and steel. His gloves grabbed the wrist of one man, twisting it until the gun clattered to the ground. A sharp elbow to the ribs sent him reeling.

The second man swung a crowbar, but Marcus ducked low, using the momentum to sweep his legs out from under him. The man hit the ground hard, groaning.

The driver was already out, pulling a pistol.

Marcus didn’t hesitate.

He raised his wrist device, projecting a blinding strobe of light directly into the man’s eyes, disorienting him enough for Marcus to deliver a precise strike to the temple.

The men were down, groaning but alive.

Lena’s voice cut in again.

“Security drones inbound. Three minutes before backup arrives.”

Marcus scanned the area and pressed a button on his wrist module. Tiny micro-drones emerged from his shoulder pads, buzzing softly as they flew ahead to create a diversion.

He sprinted toward the crates, slicing open the largest one with a vibro-knife. Inside were rows of illegal weapons — some old, some futuristic-looking — enough to arm an entire militia.

He quickly scanned the serial numbers. None were registered. All were stolen or smuggled.

“Tagging everything. Authorities will get a full report.” He sent the data to Lena.

Time was running out.

Marcus grabbed a small, black case from the crate — a prototype energy weapon with a glowing blue core. It felt powerful in his hand.

The first drone whirred overhead.

He darted toward the water’s edge, where a sleek black speedboat was moored — another gift from his family’s vast resources, modified by Lena for quick escapes.

He leapt aboard, starting the engine just as the drones opened fire.

Bullets pinged against the reinforced hull as he pushed the throttle hard, the boat slicing through the waves like a knife.

Behind him, dock security poured in, but it was too late.

Back on his penthouse balcony, Marcus removed his mask, letting the cold air wash over his sweat-damp skin.

The city below was still alive — oblivious to the small victory he had won tonight.

Lena’s voice came over the line, softer this time.

“You did good, Marcus. You saved lives today.”

He looked up at the starless sky and whispered:

“I’m just getting started.”...........",1,1758115210.0,GhostInTheCity,0,1.0,False

I don't have much knowledge in the realm of dating and am pretty sheltered in experience.

Last week I met ""Tom"" another student in one of my classes, we got along well and has some pretty good banter. The following day Tom had asked to ""hangout"" and through my interpretation I had perceived it as a friendship kind of hangout. I saw him later during that day, and he was quite touchy with me, and I was a little shocked as I don't have many male friends and didn't know if this was normal. An old friend saw the two of us and approached me, telling me about the time they had gone out together during their first year of college. Everything was fine but they clashed pretty badly, having opposing political views, life goals, and expectations of dating. That friend had told me that Tom was quite clingy, I really should have listened to her warning.

Going back to my student accomodation that day, he asked me out. I politely declined as I was ill, and brushed him off. I did like his personality at the time, however him having gone out with a good friend of mine was a complete turn off. Over roughly the next five days, he had asked me out four times, each with a different date idea that I either brushed off or declined because I didn't like the situation.

We share a common lecture, and have a very similar campus schedule. I had deflected the date asks and suggested that we get a bite or coffee during our break. When I got to campus, I had this churning feeling in my stomach, and he had asked for where I was and came to my friend and I. My friend knew that I was uneasy, and that I felt like he was being too pushy, so she stayed by me. He made a really immature joke about Thailand and it had rubbed me the wrong way, I was convinced that I didn't want to see him. I avoided him the whole day, having a few friends on lookout as I had other things to do but I did have time to grab a coffee.

A close friend that I had shared my unease to asked if he knew my name. I though this was a stupid question because how can you ask me out four times, over Instagram and still not know my name?! She urged me to ask him, and just see where it went.

When it came time for our shared lecture, I sat with my table group as per usual, and he came and sat directly next to me publicly announcing it. I wanted to die, everyone was looking at us and I made him move to the table across me. My table mates were uncomfortable as fuck as he kept kind of bouncing in his seat, very obviously staring at me and making it his mission to respond to everything I said, even if it wasn't directed towards him. In this moment I asked him if he knew my name, he said no! Claiming it was hard to pronounce and remember - my name is not hard to pronounce or remember, it's fairly common. My whole table went what the fuck, including myself. On our way out, he pushed past one of my girlfriends and walked beside me, I told him he was moving way too fast and needed to slow down. He looked offended and just walked off to find another friend of his. All my friends are beyond invested in this shit-show and all agree that I should block him.

Today, I had another lecture on campus and I saw him. I had avoided all of his messages, not responding on Instagram, as I wanted to firmly communicate my boundaries and wishes to him today. I waved at him and he ignored me, then during my lecture spammed my phone with messages asking why I was ignoring him.

The people who sit around me were so invested they offered to write me a paragraph that was along the lines of 'I want to be friends, and we are not on the same wavelength right now'. I sent the message and he responded with some pick me bullshit saying that he's 'really cringey and that he was only trying to be nice but I'm overreacting, etc'.

I ignored his messages for the next few days and somehow he didn't get the memo,  he kept sending me odd reels again. I avoided him like the plague on campus, and during our shared lecture I sat with my table and avoided talking and eye contact with him. I removed him on my Instagram too, so far we haven't spoken in person yet and I'd like to keep it that way. 

My main concern is that he doesn't understand social situations, I have this gut feeling that I can't shake off. I feel like he could become violent or aggressive for some reason. For reference I'm roughly 170cm tall and weigh 65kgs and he's 187cm tall and weighs 90kgs (not fat, mostly muscle mass he does boxing and weight training). He also hangs out with people who give me the wrong vibe. I believe that peoples friend groups are a reflection of themselves, I think he is either incredibly stupid or putting on a facade because these friends of his don't match the persona he portrays to me at all. 

I just don't know what to do, please i appreciate all kinds of advice. I need some new perspectives surrounding this situation! ",1,1758115175.0,Advice,9,0.67,False

I love nothing more than I love music. I sing and play acoustic guitar. As I kid, I used to do music, theater, dance, jewelries, drawing, storytelling, photography, everything. Also as a teenager, I was very curious to learn about biology, geography, philosophy, anatomy, languages; things that made sense in real world and life.

But unfortunately, I was also academically very successful at even the subjects that I don't care about (math, physics). Ended up in one of the best high schools in the country. At this point I should mention that I'm from Turkey where the academic pressure is very high, and other peoples opinion matter immensely.

Not explicitly but, at the end of high school, I had to choose between being an engineer vs a doctor. I thought being an engineer would give me a bit more time to myself after work & weekends, so I ended up studying something that I hated but still good at it.

Didn't want to work as an engineer so i left to Portugal to study something ""softer"" aka a masters degree on data science and ended up publishing my thesis. I taught at the uni for 3 years and loved it so much. Interacting with the students was amazing as opposed to doing research on my laptop. Every class I taught was a performance for me. I loved my teaching persona. This misled me to think that I wanted to be a Prof at the university. I started a PhD in Ai in Italy where I am now. It is actually going good cause I am a responsible person in nature so I keep publishing (I actually love giving presentations at conferences, it makes me happy -not because of the topic though, i love the act of presenting-) and researching.

But there isn't a single day that I think I am living a life defying my nature. I am not a scientist or engineer in my soul. I have always been an artist. But I lost all my creativity while studying non stop.

I am still singing, playing, choir-ing, dancing. But just as hobbies. I had a band in high school, some tiny concerts. I also performed solo in coffee shops, bars, open mics and received many compliments. I always promised myself to record myself -the last 15 years!!!-, share on YouTube, Instagram, whatever, but always something got in the way or I thought I was not good enough or I had depression (I had 3 major depressions in the last 10 years).

Now, I am too into the PhD to quit (also I need the scholarship money)(also what would I say to my parents, they worked too hard to support my education), don't have any technical music education and not good enough at music; so I'm just stuck.

I cried over million times thinking I should have done everything, anything else, except what I'm doing. I could teach languages, I could do a PhD in something exciting, meaningful, I could be a musician, I could do musicals, I even thought au pair or cleaning! I feel better cleaning my house than coming to work every day.

I keep telling myself, once I get my PhD, I'll turn my life around but what does that even mean? I don't want to end up with a wasted life in the sense of it was lived in a way that wasn't right to my existence/personality/soul. I don't know what subreddit is the right place to talk about this but this is my situation at the moment...

TLDR; I feel I'm doing something not compatible with me but I also feel like I cannot change it and don't know how or to what...",1,1758115083.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False
1njcw6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/keitruck/comments/1njcw6w/considering_a_kei/,Considering a kei,"I am a WV resident. I own property, a few miles from several state lines, and work and have an apartment in DC, which takes me through MD and VA often.

I recently tried a friend's van and really enjoyed it.

I know they can't be registered in WV. I can't register them in DC or another state because I don't live there, but I assume if I had a registration in another state I would not have an issue in MD, VA, or DC because they are allowed there. I also assume if I wouldn't have an issue in WV since it would have a registration in another state and no matter where I went I would be within 20 miles of my home or a legal state.

I am considering attempting to register in Montana. I see people suggest it can be an inexpensive as $50 or you can pay a company to do it for around $800.

I am also deciding between a van and a truck. I first wanted a truck, but I don't have much use for a truck. I just think it's neat. I would have a use for a van because I would like to use it for camping and I often play shows within a few hours of DC and could bring my guitar equipment.

Are there other legal concerns? I have never registered a car before. I have one car, I got plates at the DMV as normal, I get it inspected as normal.

If registered in Montana, does it need to be 25 years old or older? I would prefer to have airbags and know safety features are more common on newer models.

A few other considerations: 

\- What is the difference between the standard price to ship to port and customs clearance? Beforward has RORO at one price and customs clearance around $1500 higher. It seems a bit silly to pay $5000 for a $2000 vehicle.

\- Has anyone encountered tariffs? I know I have seen them on parts and other smaller items.

\- If I were to visit Japan in the future, could I avoid any expenses by purchasing there and importing it back? I do this with small but expensive items that I can carry back but am unfamiliar with the various costs of import/tariffs/taxes when it is not something that can be physically brought back when traveling.

\- Can a Montana LLC be used for anything else? For example, if I used a vehicle to do any sort of business, selling out of it, coffee truck, etc, can the same LLC in a different state be used for that business?",1,1758114995.0,keitruck,5,0.67,False

1njcub1,https://i.redd.it/sruqjio64qpf1.png,Trying and reviewing every stall in CapitaSpring (Market Street Hawker Centre) - Day 1 (#02-04 Ah Liang Ipoh Hor Fun),"Hi guys 

Day 2 of trying and reviewing every stall numerically in CapitaSpring. Original post with explanation can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeEats/comments/1nii6vi/trying_and_reviewing_every_stall_in_capitaspring/)

What I had:   
\#02-04 Ah Liang Ipoh Hor Fun  
Shredded Chicken Hor fun with Crab Meat, L size $7.00

**What I liked:**  
The fish dumplings were damn good, freshly fried without being too oily, with a rich filling in every bite. The fact that they gave you 3 pieces feels quite generous (ala carte dumpling is $1.10, so in a sense the hor fun itself is only $4.70), and you can slowly take one bite of the dumpling together with a few bites of the hor fun itself and finish them simultaneoulsy at the same time. 

Queue was very fast and efficient. Went there at around 11:30am and there were 15-20 people in front of me and I was expecting to wait about 30 mins. To my surprise it only took 15 mins; the lady boss would take your order first while you're still queuing and the aunties in the store would be packing your order already b y the time you reach the front. 

They are very generous with the ingredients. You can't see it in the photo but behind the surface hides a lotttttt of shreded chicken and crab meat. 

**What I didn't like:**  
Maybe not so much a 'didn't like' but more so that the hor fun itself tastes normal compared to the fish dumplings; it's very very decent but not to the level of the fish dumplings. 

**Final Rating:**  
3 plates - can see why there's such a long queue

But don't panic, we've all been there. First and foremost, **relax.** The first week is more about meeting new people and getting to know your surroundings than you might think.

Classes and Bureaucratic Stuff: The ""IRL"" Registration Game

The first week can feel like an **IRL (in real life)** RPG. Your quests include:

* **Class Registration:** It's usually done through an online system, but you might still find yourself wondering, ""Who's my advisor?"" Don't worry, everyone is in the same boat. To find out if a class is open or who your advisor is, dig through the university's website or, even better, find a WhatsApp or Telegram group for **""freshmen.""**
* **Orientation:** You might be on the fence about going. Just go. Seriously. **It can be boring, I admit. But you might snag a free T-shirt or bag.** Most importantly, you'll learn the campus map, find out where buildings are, and maybe even make your first campus friends.

# Social Life: The Socializing Party

It's a lot like socializing on Reddit. You can observe the loners or the different groups.

* **Clubs:** The university club fair can feel like a festival. Whether it's a gaming club, a climbing group, or a movie club, **go, sign up, and meet people!** The first week is the best time to figure out ""what clubs are even out there?""
* **Exploration:** If you're in a new city, Google Maps will be your best friend this week. Discover things like ""there's a good coffee shop over there"" or ""that place has great kebabs."" **Look for subreddits or threads like ""Student Life in X City,"" they can be super helpful!**

#  Practical Life: ""Real Life"" Coding

* **Housing and Transportation:** This involves your dorm or roommates. Finding the closest market, bus stop, and cafe to where you live will make your life a lot easier. **Getting your student public transport card is one of your top priorities.** Don't hesitate to ask, ""Where can I top up my 'Istanbulkart'?"" Everyone will be happy to help.
* **Finances:** During the first week, you'll have small but crucial tasks like opening a bank account or signing up for subscriptions.

In a nutshell: **The first week is all about ""trial and error.""** Make mistakes, get lost, and don't be afraid to meet new people. Most people are in the same situation anyway. What's the worst that could happen?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My husband and I have an Airbnb, so we understand how much a negative review can impact a listing.
We are on our honeymoon in Crete after getting married in Santorini. We checked into a Airbnb with a gorgeous view and opened up our luggage right away, changed, and went out to dinner. We got back late and turned on the kitchen lights.  3-4 roaches scattered. I was pretty freaked out and messaged our host. They apologized profusely and stated that they had never had reports of roaches before, but to use the bug spray under the sink. 
I know if you see one roach there are hundreds more and bug spray was going to do little to alleviate the actual problem.  I packed up all of our stuff and put it in the bedroom. They said they were likely coming out of the drains and to seal up the sink drain.  We did just that and hoped that would help.  
The following night we came back to even more roaches, now crawling on the ceiling and the coffee table in the living room.  We only booked 2 nights, so I spent a late night unpacking and inspecting every item of clothing in the 2 suitcases that were open on the floor for signs of roaches. The idea of them hitchhiking with us is a nightmare.  
The hosts offered free clothing laundering for us, which was a kind offer, but we have to move on to our next destination.  
My question is, what should we do about the review?  I am doubtful that they did not know about the amount of roaches in the room. I don’t want to destroy their reputation, but also don’t want to be exposing other Airbnb guests and hosts to a roach infestation.  What would you do in this situation?

1njcnap,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1njcnap/explore_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_by_bodum/,Explore the best pour over coffee maker by Bodum worth brewing with,"Testing out the Bodum 11592-01US Pour Over Coffee Maker felt like stepping into a new world of coffee brewing. I have spent years trying out various brewing methods, and this one definitely offers a unique experience for coffee enthusiasts. From its sleek design to its functional features, this coffee maker blends simplicity with sophistication, though not without a few quirks.

**Sleek and Functional Design**  
The aesthetic appeal of this pour-over coffee maker is undeniable. Made from high-heat borosilicate glass, it feels sturdy yet lightweight. The glass doesn’t absorb any aromas or tastes, which is an absolutely brilliant feature, preserving the purity of the coffee’s flavor. Sitting on my countertop, the brewer’s black sleeve adds a modern, classy vibe without clashing with the rest of my kitchen gadgets. What I loved most was the size—it’s compact enough to store away but stylish enough that I don’t mind leaving it out. At 4.6 inches deep and 5.5 inches wide, it doesn't hog up counter space like some larger options. Despite being eye-catching, there’s a certain minimalism to its design that’s very appealing.  

**Simple Yet Effective Coffee Brewing**  
The process of using this pour-over coffee maker couldn’t be more straightforward. It’s completely manual, so if you like hands-on brewing, you’re in for a treat. Everything about it feels intentional—the stainless steel reusable filter stands out in particular. Unlike disposable paper filters that soak up the essential oils from your coffee, this filter retains all the rich, robust flavors. This brewing method draws you into the art of making coffee, and there’s an unexplainable satisfaction in watching the water draw out the deep brown hues of a fresh brew. It’s not as fast as an electric coffee maker, but for coffee purists like me, brewing this way feels rewarding.

[Check Bodum 11592-01US price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0d6xrlss8/)

**Capacity and Everyday Use**  
Being able to brew up to 17 ounces of coffee in one go is perfect for my daily morning routine. It’s an excellent size for one or two servings, whether I’m sipping solo or sharing my morning brew with my roommate. However, this might not be the ideal choice for those hosting guests or looking to make multiple cups in one session. An unexpected bonus for me was its portability. Its compact size and manual operation make it travel-friendly, easily slipping into a tote for those weekend cabin trips.

**Pluses**  
- The glass carafe is crafted from borosilicate, ensuring no flavor absorption.  
- The stainless steel filter is eco-friendly and produces a rich, full-bodied coffee.  
- Lightweight yet durable, making it both portable and long-lasting.  
- Suitable for iced coffee preparation, adding versatility.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Cleaning the metal filter can be a hassle—it requires scrubbing to remove stubborn grounds.  
- It’s not ideal for serving larger groups due to its modest capacity.  
- Water temperature and pouring technique greatly affect the brew, requiring patience to perfect.  

**Competing Products**  
I’ve had my fair share of comparisons, most notably the Chemex and Hario V60 pour-over coffee makers. All three focus on bringing out the nuanced flavors of coffee, but each has its own strengths. Chemex uses biodegradable paper filters, which some argue clean out oils but also compromise on flavor depth. The Hario V60, on the other hand, delivers an incredibly controlled and precise pour but lacks the integrated reusable filter. In contrast, this coffee maker sits right in-between—offering a professional-like brew while placing a strong emphasis on sustainability. If you want something simple without paper waste, the Bodum option edge outs its competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This pour-over coffee maker stands out as a long-term investment. Thanks to its stainless steel filter, there’s no need to buy one-time-use paper filters, saving money and reducing waste. Other pour-over systems might offer similar performance, but reusable components like this make a strong case for environmental friendliness and cost savings combined. While it’s slightly pricier upfront compared to simpler systems like plastic models, the features and build justify its value, especially for coffee lovers passionate about their morning rituals.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Each stop involved a spoken portion about the new edition and a large segment with public audience questions. The questions here mostly come from these portions, taken from eight different stops on the tour. 

(I gathered these at the time of the tour, but never really got around to doing anything with them until now, over two years later.)

The quotations have here been reordered and categorized into what I hope is a more readable format. The source of each quotation will be indicated with a bracketed notation, which is explained [in a comment under the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fractalverse/comments/1njcixb/_/nep5iot/)

Due to length, this has been split into three separate posts. [The first post focused on questions related to The World of Eragon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1ngqq7u/) This second post will focus on **questions about the Fractalverse: it's future works, lore, and creation**. The third and final post will cover writing advice, Christopher's reading, and other miscellaneous topics.


# Part Five - The Future of the Fractalverse

**To Sleep 2**

> *I have grand plans for the larger series, which include a direct sequel to To Sleep in a Sea of Stars and lots of big things going on in the background. I have to actually write these stories and write these books so you can see how all these pieces fit together.* [1]

> *I am building a very large story in this setting. There are several sequels planned to To Sleep in a Sea of Stars.* [10]

> *Fractal Noise is setting the stage for the big book that's gonna happen as a sequel to To Sleep in a Sea of Stars.* [8]

> *You'll learn more about [the Soft Blade] in the next book after To Sleep* [7]

> **Will we get more of the ship mind Gregorovich in the future?**  
> *Yes.* [8]

> **Will we learn more about some of the advanced aliens that are hinted at here and there?**  
> *Yes, we will learn more about them.* [8]

**Allies**

> **In the future novels are we gonna see more about Earth?**  
> *Yes we will see more. I actually wrote a short story after To Sleep came out that's set on an orbital ring around Earth. It's called ""Allies"". Ferrari does an end of year coffee table book, and they solicit short stories from people for the book. My dead Italian grandfather would have risen from the grave and slapped me outside the head if I had not given Ferrari a short story. Since it was a story for Ferrari, I actually had a Ferrari race taking place on an orbital ring around Earth. We haven't released that in other formats yet, but we're looking at that. So yes, we will see more of Earth. Earth stories do feature. I think it'd be a fascinating thing to visit an Earth where it has a massive orbital ring in the Fractalverse in 250 years in the future.* [1]

**Military SF**

> *One of the future Fractalverse books that I want to write is a space marine book.* [1]

**YA Steampunk**

> *My next book that I want to write is a YA steampunk set in the 1900s with a zeppelin, and a plucky little girl who's a wannabe explorer.* [4]

> *My plan from here on out is to basically ping pong between the Fractalverse and World of Eragon. Murtagh is coming out November, I'm writing another Fractalverse book next, then I'm back to Alagaësia. The only thing that's really gonna mess that up is the potential Eragon television show which is under development at Disney Plus.* [8]

> *Next book up is Murtagh and after that I'm going right back into the Fractalverse. Actually sooner than that, because I'll be done with the editing soon on Murtagh and then I can go write about spaceships and aliens and explosions all over again.* [10]

**Adaptations**

> **Shortly after you released To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, you announced that there was going to be a film adaption.**  
> *That got swapped. We decided that television was a better format because the story is so big. Hollywood development is often fraught and there is no major problem with it, the producer is just taking a long time. I've already written a couple of scripts. I think it would be a wonderful, wonderful show. I think it's gonna happen. This stuff just takes time, unfortunately.* [4]

> **Is there any chance of turning To Sleep in a Sea of Stars into a movie?**  
> *To Sleep in a Sea of Stars in currently in development as a television miniseries, with me writing the scripts. The producers are moving slowly with it, but we have the pilot and the second episode episode all written, and hopefully we'll be moving forward with that. Hollywood has a strike going on right now, so everything is kinda of stalled out, but we have a television deal and I would very much like to see it made as a show.* [6]

> **Is it true they're working on a Fractalverse adaptation?**  
> *Yes. To Sleep in a Sea of Stars has been picked up for a miniseries television show sort of thing. I am producing. I've written the pilot and the second episode. We're stalled out because the writers strike. But hopefully that'll be moving forward before too long because I think it would make an amazing adaptation.* [8]

# Part Six - Fractalverse In-Universe Lore

**Softblade**

> **Would you consider the Soft Blade an AI because it was created, or sentient, or what?**  
> *I haven't actually explained that fully. It is an artificial living creature with a high degree of intelligence. But whether or not we would classify it as sentience? It may not quite be there, but it is still highly intelligent. It also has actual programming in it that guides its behavior. Even though it has degrees of freedom in its behavior, there are certain things that it's also being guided to do. You could call that instincts, but they were artificially placed in the Soft Blade.* [7]

> *The source of power that [the Soft Blade] has is going to be dealt with in the future, because it's not magic. There's no magic there.* [1]

**Humanoid Aliens**

> **Is it possible for a future book to have a humanoid alien species?**  
> *I have an interactive story on fractalverse.net. It's called Unity. It's set after To Sleep, and we actually get a human-like alien showing up in that story. So definitely a possibility.* [7]

**Jellies**

> *You ever wonder why we call them butterflies? They're not made of butter and they're not really kind of flies. Well, the best theory we have that's linguistically accepted is that some of the letters were transposed and they think that a kid messed it up and everyone thought it was so funny that it stuck. And that the original word was ""flutterby"". They're flutterbys. I love Anglo-Saxon naming traditions because Anglo-Saxon naming traditions just are like hit-you-on-head-with-hammer. ""What is it?"" ""It flutters by."" ""Flutter by!"" That's actually why in To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, the aliens that show up are commonly called by the humans ""jellies"", because they look like jellyfish, because they've got tentacles. That's how we name things.* [7]

**Great Beacon**

> **Are the hole and the great beacon the same thing?**  
> *Yes. Yes. The hole is the great beacon. That's what it comes to be called after the fact.* [8]

**To Sleep Ending**

> **Was the ship that appeared at the very end of To Sleep to tell Kira her family was alive the Wallfish?**  
> *It was the Wallfish at the end of To Sleep. I should have made that more clear.* [10]

**Crossovers**

> **Did Angela make a cameo in To Sleep in a Sea of Stars?**  
> *She is in To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, and there is a canon reason for this. You should have no problem spotting who she is in that book.* [1]

> **How do the Inheritance Cycle and the Fractalverse intersect beyond Angela?**  
> *No comment. Great question.* [2]

> **Are we ever going to see a connection between Inarë and Angela?**  
> *If you read the afterword of To Sleep, you'll know they're the same person.*  
> **Are we gonna see more of that?**  
> *Yes.* [4]

> **Is there going to be a merging of the two worlds?**  
> *Will the Fractalverse and the World of Eragon merge? Are they in the same universe? Great question, no comment.* [6]

> **Will the barriers of the multiverse break down and Eragon get on the stage?**  
> *Great question. No comment.* [7]

> **Will you ever create a bridge between the World of Eragon and the Fractalverse?**  
> *What a great question, no comment.* [8]


# Part Seven - Fractalverse Technology

**Researching the Fractalverse**

> *Working on one series for over ten years taught me the real value of having a setting where I can tell multiple stories over the years. You read multiple books in a single setting and you really get to know the characters and the world in a way that you just don't with one book. I really love that as a writer.* [8] *So I decided it was worth spending a lot of time to build the setting for my sci-fi stories before I even wrote the first one, with the idea that once this setting, this Fractalverse, existed, I could write stories in it for the rest of my life.* [6]

> *After I'd finished touring for the last book of the Inheritance Cycle back in 2013, I started researching. I've always loved science, but I really didn't have a deep enough understanding of a lot of topics to confidently write science fiction at that point. So I did nothing but read and research for about a year and a half. How would spaceships work? How would combat work in space? How would computers advance? How would gene modification biotechnology advance? We've all seen movies, television shows, and read books that deal with those topics. We all sort of have a collective idea of how those things might happen. But I wanted answers that were specific to my universe and my world, and that would help differentiate it from those other franchises.* [6]

> *Now, if you haven't read To Sleep in a Sea of Stars or Fractal Noise, don't worry, I'm not dumping a bunch of technobabble on you, it's all buried in the back of the book. But I had to understand it in order to write the story, because it's what determined what was or wasn't possible in the world, just as magic determines what is or isn't possible in fantasy.* [10]

**FTL**

> *The hardest thing that I found after all that research was figuring out how to get my characters from point A to point B. Because as Douglas Adams said, ""space is really big"". Doing it realistically means your characters are stuck on a ship for hundreds, if not thousands of years. And that just didn't appeal to me. So I knew I needed some way for my characters to go faster than light.* [10] 

> *The problem is, how do I have that without turning all of my spaceships into time machines? Because according to physics as we know it, if you go faster than light, you've got a time machine. And you don't really want your space taxi driver to just be able to take you back in time so you can kill your grandfather or something. So some system of physics that doesn't contradict what we know now, that allows for faster than light travel, doesn't allow for time travel, and hasn't been used by any other science fiction franchise. That's what took me a year and a half.* [6]

> *Eventually I found my own crackpot. Well, that's not exactly fair. He's a lovely gentleman. His name's Gregory, and he works helping study and develop nuclear propulsion for NASA. He's a very smart guy, and he and a couple other engineers and physicists have developed a rather esoteric theory. It's not quite a theory of everything, but it's verging on it. And no one else was aware of this, really, and no one else had used it. So I called Greg up and I said, ""you don't know me from a hole in the wall, but I've got some questions."" And he was really kind and actually spent, probably 30, 40 hours on the phone with me over a number of days and weeks and talked me through all the implications of the theory. That formed the basis for a lot of advanced technology in the Fractalverse.* [6]

**Markov Limit**

> *With faster than light travel you have to have some way of making it impossible for a ship or an object to go FTL close to a planet and here's why. You don't like someone? Strap an FTL drive to an asteroid, aim it toward them, it goes FTL and then it pops back into normal space or normal speed 50 feet above the surface of the planet. What are you gonna do? Nothing. Boom, right? So that's why a lot of these systems including mine are set up so that you can't go FTL within the gravitational disturbance near a planet or a star because otherwise you run into exactly that problem. There's no warning even if you have FTL sensors.* [6] 

**Heat**

> *There's all sorts of interesting things you can do and restrictions you have when you actually pay attention to the fact that spaceships are really hot. The engines are hot, the weapons are hot, and you're in space, which is a really good insulator. So your ship overheats and then you can't shoot anymore because you're going to cook yourself.* [1]

**AI and Ship Minds**

> **I'm fascinated about ship minds. How did you come up with that new concept?**  
> *I was doing a ton of research into artificial intelligence because it's a big decision whether or not you have AI in your science fiction universe. I became increasingly convinced that true artificial intelligence, as defined by a self-aware sentient mind, is something that we don't understand. We do not physically understand how the atoms and molecules of our brain are aware of themselves. We can't point to a mechanism where consciousness comes from. And as far as we know, the human brain is the only place that occurs to the level we see. So to say that we're going to recreate it using circuits and programming, seems like a really big leap. However, on the biological side of things, we're seeing a lot of advancements with gene hacking and all sorts of biological stuff. In a couple hundred years, all sorts of things are gonna be possible in terms of manipulating our bodies in all sorts of interesting ways. And it seems to me that given opportunity, humans would certainly expand their intellect, which also ties into something I read about how the more sensory stimulus you have, the larger the brain you need. Whale brains are enormous. They're not necessarily more intelligent than us, but they have to have huge chunks of brain matter devoted to visual processing, because their eyes are huge and they have a huge amount of nerve signals coming in. So how do you run a giant spaceship? Well, it'd be great if you had a giant brain that could handle all the inputs and maybe some people who your body's damaged or otherwise destroyed would volunteer to go in that direction. I find the mutability and changeability of the human body fascinating.* [2]

> *AI is nonsense and I don't believe it. There's a reason there's no AI in my future. ChatGPT, Midjourney, all these other AI programs, are not sentient. They are not true intelligence. That's why in my books I call them pseudo-intelligences. They're not AI. We can call them AI, they might be useful, but they are not self-aware creatures. I think true self-aware sentient AI is a lot harder than it may seem. And that's actually a good thing. I don't really want to be bowing to our digital overlords.* [6]

**Casaba-Howitzer**

> *Aside from the soft blade itself, my favorite weapon from the Fractalverse is a Casaba-Howitzer. This is something that was invented by a mad scientist here in the US back in the 60s or 70s. A shaped charge is what you use to punch through the armor on a tank. You have a disk of metal and you put some explosives on one side of it, set off the explosives, and it turns the disk of metal into this spike that punches through anything that's in front of it. It's pretty insane. And of course these scientists said, ""Cool, what if we did that with a nuke?"" So that's Casaba-Howitzer. You have a plate of material, you put a nuke on the backside of it, set the nuke off, and it makes a spike of plasma that's moving at about 10% of the speed of light. It's not a long-range weapon, but if you are in range of it, you are in deep, deep, deep trouble. I hadn't seen anyone using that in sci-fi, and I found that and I was like, ""yes, we're using that"". You can also use the nukes to create bomb-pumped lasers. You set off a nuke and it powers an x-ray laser. It destroys the laser at the same time, but you get this incredible pulse of energy. Or you can just set off the Casaba-Howitzer with no plate and simply shape the radiation and plasma coming off the bomb itself to create a death ray. Casaba-Howitzers are used in the Fractalverse quite a lot because they will blast through anything. If you use missiles, you can shoot them down with point-defense lasers. If you just use lasers alone, you can defeat them with reflective material like chalk and chaff, which is mentioned in book quite a lot. So there's always this balancing between defense, offense, and explosions.* [10]

**Rods From God**

> *""Rods from God"" were invented by Jerry Pournelle, a sci-fi author back in the 60s who was working for Boeing. The idea is that you get a long rod of tungsten, the size of a telephone pole, and you put it up in orbit, and if there's anyone or anything you don't like, you just drop that rod on them. Because it's tungsten, it doesn't melt up during reentry, and it has so much kinetic energy coming down, you essentially get the effect of a small nuke without any of the radiation. No one as far as we know has actually put anything like that in orbit, but it's exactly the sort of thing that you know that some governments would do.* [10]

**Relativistic Missiles**

> *If there are hostile aliens out there, there is no defense because of what's called a relativistic missile. You strap a bunch of propellant and a bunch of engines to something. It almost doesn't matter what. It could be an asteroid, it could be a hunk of metal, it could be a rocket, whatever. You accelerate it to a large proportion of the speed of light toward your target. When something is going that fast, you don't see it until it's pretty close and you don't have time to react because you can't accelerate fast enough in the time you have. The faster something goes, the more energy it releases when it hits something. Mass moving that fast will release more energy than the equivalent nuclear bomb would. It's almost like an antimatter bomb. And if some species saw us or our distant ancestors through a telescope and didn't like us, they could have sent some of those things heading our way and we wouldn't even know until it was too late.* [6]

**Project Orion**

> *Project Orion is the coolest. These scientists said ""We'd love to lift a heavy rocket into space. What if we just had a bouncing pusher plate in the back of the spaceship and put some nukes behind it, and blast our way up with nukes?"" The science works. They tested this. And the cool thing is, the bigger the spaceship, the more efficient it is. If we ever have to build a spaceship that will get us into space and let us move around huge amounts of mass, we'd probably be building a Project Orion.* [10]

**Orbital Rings**

> *Orbital rings are amazing. The problem with a space station and other things is if you put it in orbit, it has to move around the Earth, or it just falls down. It's in free fall. So it's falling, and it's falling around, and the rate at which it falls matches the curvature of the Earth, so it doesn't hit the surface of the ground. Great. The problem is you have no gravity up in the space station, so everything just floats. So some physicists had this bright idea that you could put a chain in orbit of ferrous metal. It could even be beads. You surround it by electromagnets, just like the trains that use the magnets to levitate. You accelerate this chain, these beads, whatever, and as they accelerate, they want to go outward. If you accelerate them enough, they will hold the ring in orbit. You build a platform around it, and then you can stand on the platform. And even if this is as high as the space station currently is, the space station actually experiences most of the gravity we feel here on Earth. It's just they're falling in a circle. So you can actually stand on this ring and move around, build a house, live a life, grow a garden, whatever. You might die from lack of oxygen, but put a dome over it. Orbital rings are fantastic. And you can just take an elevator up to one.* [1]


# Part Eight - Writing To Sleep

**Initial Idea**

> *Back between Brisingr and Inheritance, I had an idea for a sci-fi story and that idea ended up becoming To Sleep in a Sea of Stars.* [1] 

**Publishing Gap**

> *The biggest reason there's such a gap between books for me is just I spent so long working on the Inheritance Cycle I had to go live my life and grow up and be a regular person for a while and then I got trapped in writing and rewriting To Sleep far longer than I should have.* [10]

**Early Drafts**

> *Before I wrote Eragon, I spent a lot of time outlining the book, outlining the whole series, building the world, making sure I understood it well before I started writing, and that saved my bacon because it gave me a strong roadmap to follow. When I started To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, I'd come off of ten years of publishing very successful books, and my skills had gotten rusty, but I got cocky. I thought, ""I know what I'm doing, I don't need to put in all that work. I can do it by the seat of my pants as I write it."" No, I couldn't.* [8]

> *I started writing this book in 2014.* [10] *I wrote a first draft and it didn't work. Then I went and did a second draft and it didn't work. A third draft and it didn't work. At that point I had to decide whether to basically abandon the book or think of something completely different. Because the revisions I was doing were essentially rearranging the deck chairs of the Titanic.* [1]

> *It wasn't until the end of 2017 that I finally realized I was at a crisis point with it.* [6] *My agent and editor very kindly said to me, ""Christopher, this isn't working"".* [8] *I stepped back from the book and I thought, ""Am I going to go write something new or am I really going to figure out what's not working here?""* [1]

> *So I stepped away from the computer and in a week and a half I wrote 200 pages of notes by hand and I ripped apart every aspect of the characters, the world, the story, everything, and reconstructed them to figure out if there was something worth salvaging. And I did. I found a story I was happy with and dove into rewriting it. There is no magic bullet. You're going to put the work in upfront or on the back end, one way or another. And it's a lot easier to do it on the upfront because rewriting a 300,000 word book hurts.* [8]

> *To Sleep in a Sea of Stars is divided into sections. Everything after the first 25 pages of the second section was written from scratch during the revision process. All the places they go, all the creatures they interact with, all the things they do, all of that came about probably in like the fourth draft of the book, all the way into 2018.* [10]

**Symbolism and Sphincters**

> **I saw the progression of the soft blade in a self-actualization or fulfillment of potential kind of light. What starts as this kind of scaly thing that might stab you and becomes an entirely different entity of much greater capability. As an author, how much thinking do you do in an allegorical capacity and how important that is to you as a writer?**  
> *I love that question because the answer is the soft blade is a metaphor. Honestly everything is in a story. The more you read about story structure the more things you see. The surface things you're seeing might be the most important when you're starting out your journey as a writer and a storyteller. But then the more you learn about structure and stuff, things become symbols and you realize it doesn't matter that this story is set in the Victorian era and this story is set in the far future. At their heart, they're the same story or they're using similar elements. And so the answer to your question is a lot of thought goes into it. And a lot of thought also to keep it from being too obvious to the readers, because I don't want to preach to the readers. Of course, the tool and symbiote that Kira is dealing with in To Sleep in a Sea of Stars is representative of her own issues and things she's dealing with.* [1]

> *I had all of the alien doors being like sphincters in the first draft and my editor and my dad both said ""Enough with the sphincters. No more sphincters"". I said ""They're alien doors!"" They said ""Nooo!!"". I'm very juvenile with my sense of humor. Look, we were writing about the ass-end [ascent] of space, so... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.* [8]

**Kira Navarez Inspiration**

> **How was going from writing mostly male characters to writing a woman for To Sleep in a Sea of Stars?**  
> *Not that different. I've written from female points of view in the Inheritance Cycle, and I simply approached Kira as I would any character. I figured I was going to get myself into more trouble if I approached her with a thought that ""I must write a female character"". Instead I approached her with, ""I must write the best character I can"". Now, to be fair, I've seen some reviewers who thought I did a horrible job in writing a woman. I've also seen some female reviewers who said I did a really good job writing a woman. And I think that just goes to show how different everyone's experience of being male and female is. I have seen women write men, where I go, ""that is not my experience"", but I've had male friends in my life who said, ""I really related to that character"", and vice versa. I have future stories planned that are also with female leads and lots with male leads.* [1]

> *I was definitely thinking of Ripley from Aliens and Sarah Connor. When I was growing up, I was like ""Where are these characters? Why aren't there more of them?"" And Kira was a bit of my own tribute to that.* [1]

> **Did the character from Deep Space Nine, Kira Nerys, have any influence on the name Kira Navarez?**  
> *You're darn right it did. Actually, the last name Navarez is the last name of the very first female state senator in the state of Montana, which is where I live. I know nothing else about that person, but the name lives on.* [8]

**The Wallfish**

> *Wallfish is an old Anglo-Saxon word for snail. What can I say, I like snails. The reason they called them wallfish is because back in the day you weren't supposed to eat meat on Friday. So they were looking for all sorts of exceptions for that so they could have more things to eat on Friday. So they started to categorize other things as not meat. Ducks live in water, so they're not meat. And oh, these snails? Yeah, these are ""wall fish"", so we can eat them on Friday.* [10]

**Gregorovich**

> *When I find a character particularly interesting, they can often go in directions I don't plan. In To Sleep in the Sea of Stars, that would be Gregorovich. In the Inheritance Cycle, that would be Elva and Angela, and a couple of others. I don't go too far off the rails in terms of the larger structure. Small eccentricities, but doesn't completely derail my larger plans. Usually.* [8]

> **Which character has been your favorite perspective to write in any of the books?**  
> *In To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, probably whenever I got to write Gregorovich. Gregorovich was so much fun to write, and I hate to say it, but he's probably the person in that book who's closest to who I am. I don't know what that says about me.* [10]


# Part Nine - Writing Fractal Noise

**Writing the First Draft**

> *When I was finishing Inheritance, all the way back in 2011, I had a night with some really weird dreams. Kind of hallucinogenic almost. ... But then the dreams shifted and in the second half of the night, I dreamt that I saw this bare, rocky planet turning in the void of space, and on that planet there was this giant hole, fifty kilometers across, absolutely perfectly circular, and it was emitting this blast of sound every couple of seconds. And on the windswept plane surrounding the hole there was a small group of figures who were advancing toward the artifact to investigate it.* [8] *And as with so many dreams, there was this intense emotion attached to the feeling, and as soon as I woke up I grabbed my notebook and I wrote down all the things I'd seen and felt, because I knew there was a story here. Or at least an idea that could become a story.* [1]

> *And that's what I developed then into the first draft of Fractal Noise in 2013,* [6] *as I was doing all my research for the Fractalverse.* [1] *I decided to write Fractal Noise as a way of dipping my toe into this new setting and figuring out how to work in it.* [8]

> *But when I read the first draft, I wasn't really happy with it.* [6] *It wasn't particularly good. Usually that happens with my first drafts. It got me 70% of the way there, but that last 30% is really important. So I decided that I was going to put it to the side and go write To Sleep in Sea of Stars as a proper introduction to the Fractalverse for readers.* [1]

**Rewriting The Book**

> *So that's what I did. I went and wrote To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, which unfortunately took me way longer than it should have, but I did finish it. And then when I was done, I sat down, looked at Fractal Noise, and decided that yes, there was something here I really cared about and wanted to devote myself to the point of finishing it, which is what I did.* [1]

> *The first draft was quite a bit shorter and quite a bit grimmer, actually. ... let's just say that the original ending of Fractal Noise was exactly opposite from what it is now. The choice the main character makes was the exact opposite that he makes now. I have received tens of thousands of letters over the years from people who have been touched and helped by moments in the Inheritance Cycle. And that's really touched me. And it really drove home to me that if the books could have that sort of positive influence on people and inspiring them or helping them through a tough time in their life they could just as easily have the opposite effect. I'm not a big fan of grimdark stories, especially where they end grimdark. I almost feel like it's authorial misconduct to write books like that. Life's hard for everyone in one way or another, so why make it harder? That's also why I don't really enjoy watching horror movies. I'll write horror for some strange reason, but even then, I don't like it where it just leaves me feeling bad. So that was a lot of the changes I made.* [6]

> *I also really enjoyed writing a somewhat smaller book. This is a petite novel. In fact, for the longest time, my agent and I were referring to this as a short story. Because compared with To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, it kind of is.* [1]

**Meaning of the Book**

> *I don't normally talk about why I write stories on a really deep level. I prefer people to read the books themselves. Have your own reactions, make your own judgments. That's how the process should work. I also hate to pull the curtain back too much to go into the deep mechanics of what I'm doing because I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone who's reading.* [7] 

> *This, in many ways, is the most personal book I've ever written. I don't know exactly what that says about me, but this is very much where my brain was when I finished the Inheritance Cycle.* [6]

> *I wrote this book as my way of examining how it is we, as humans, as people, deal with the things that we can't change. And specifically, when you lose someone, because it's an inevitability in life. Now I have not lost anyone in my life that specifically inspired this, but it's something I've thought about a lot and wrestled with those existential questions.* [1]

> *I wrote this book to grapple with the question of ""how do you keep putting one step in front of the other when life gets difficult?"" Because life gets difficult for all of us. I've had the great fortune of meeting some of the top people in the world in various fields, and everyone has difficulty, no matter how wealthy or well-off they seem from the outside. I do think that question of how do you persist in the face of adversity is in many ways the great question of life. It's a question that religion grapples with, that philosophy grapples with, and sometimes even science. And it's something I've grappled with my whole life and thought about a lot. And this particular story was my way of examining it in a novel form. I hope you like the conclusion I came to by the end of that, or at least that the main character came to.* [7]

> *This novel is my way of grappling with that question while still having aliens and spaceships and things like that.* [10]

**Religious Discussions**

> **In Fractal Noise, there's a lot of biblical back and forth. What inspired you to make your characters interact in such a manner for the Fractalverse?**  
> *There's some religious discussion in Fractal Noise, because Fractal Noise revolves around humanity's first discovery of definitive proof of intelligent alien life. And it just seems to me that humans are humans. Modern humans have existed genetically for 250,000 years. We are going to be no different than we are now in another 200 years. And if we found any proof of alien life like that, I think we would be discussing it from all different angles: philosophical angles, religious angles, scientific angles, and that would be really important to people from all different angles.*  
> **Was it difficult to have the characters interact in that way?**  
> *I wouldn't say it was difficult to have the characters interact like that. I like arguing. I am one of those annoying people who will happily argue any position. I have my own strongly held beliefs, but I will happily argue any position.* [4]

**Coordinates Easter Egg**

> *I did all the illustrations for Fractal Noise. On the image, there are GPS coordinates for the location they're landing on the planet in Fractal Noise. It's the longitude and latitude of the valley where I live in Montana. I tried to slip little things like that in there.* [1]


# Part Ten - More About the Fractalverse

**Names**

> **Do you have a method for naming characters?**  
> *For the Fractalverse, I just try to come up with as wide a variety of names as possible. I was just in New York City. I saw more people in the last day and a half than I have in last two and a half years. And a wider variety of people too. Shapes, backgrounds, accents, names, all of them. That's what modern life in a big city is. I would imagine a far future out and about would be equally as diverse. I have the advantage too of seeing an insane number of names in book signings. So that helps too.* [2]


**Thin Pages**

> *The pages are too thin. To Sleep in the Sea of Stars is the largest book I have ever written. Inheritance is 280,000 words long, and this monster is 308,000 words long. I thought for sure I was gonna get a thousand page book out of this and I know how thick a thousand page book looks like. (Sometimes people just like you for your big books.) And then I got the early version of the book from Tor, and it's not a huge, thick book. So I called up my editor at Tor and I said, ""Where's my big book?"" And they explained to me that Brandon Sanderson has written books that are so big, verging on over 400,000 words, that Tor had no choice but to swap to a thinner paper stock. If you see more recent printings of the Stormlight Archive, you'll notice that they are actually thinner than older editions. Any book that's over a certain size, Tor uses this thinner paper stock on. They also used it for Fractal Noise in order to keep the same style for the series. So that's why the pages are so thin in this book. It's Brandon Sanderson's fault. It really is. And I'm going to rag on him the next time I see him for that, because he needs to write shorter books.* [6]




**Audiobook**

> *The voice actress who voiced the female lead in the Mass Effect games is none other than Jennifer Hale, who has read the audiobooks for the Fractalverse, and these are the very first audiobooks she has ever read. She holds the Guinness World Record for most prolific voice actress. I can't even list what she's done. Including the voice of Saphira in the Eragon video game, some uncredited work there. I met her at a convention in Australia in 2012 and got to interview her and I said, ""I'd love to work together someday."" She said, ""Sure, well, that would be nice."" You have to understand, especially in the Hollywood side of things, people always say this. ""Oh, it would be lovely to work together"" ""Mhmm. Sure would"" And then you never see the person again. And then when To Sleep was getting ready for the audiobook I actually messaged Jennifer on Twitter and I said ""I don't know if you remember me, but I think you'd be perfect for this"" and she was. She recorded a song from for us called Sea of Stars, which is on YouTube for free. It's a theme for the Fractalverse and for To Sleep in a Sea of Stars. It's beautiful. She also sang a song that one of the characters sings in the audiobook for Fractal Noise.* [2]

> *Tor did an amazing job with the audiobook for Fractal Noise. There's music, there's sound effects, and of course, Jennifer Hale, who is a special effect all on her own. A fan of mine by the name of Malte, who's a German reader, was composing fan-made music for the Inheritance Cycle a couple years ago. I liked it so much, I had him do music for the audiobook of To Sleep, and now Fractal Noise, and he just keeps getting better and better.* [6] *It turns out [Malte Wegmann] is even better at sci-fi music than he is at fantasy music and he's pretty good at fantasy music.* [7] *With Fractal Noise, the audiobook might actually be better than the text version.* [8]


**Reading Order**

> *To Sleep in the Sea of Stars is a big epic love letter to the genre of science fiction. It is a space opera. It is a multi-course banquet with spaceships, lasers, aliens, explosions, romance, and bad puns. I had a lot of fun writing that. Now, Fractal Noise is a little different. It is a single-course meal, and it's a strange beastie compared with what I've written before. The reviews on Goodreads at the moment are sort of  schizophrenic. They're bouncing between one star and four or five stars. I hope you guys enjoy it, but it seems to be a very personal thing. If you don't like Fractal Noise, there's a chance you still may enjoy To Sleep thoroughly and vice versa. Or you may enjoy them both equally and think I'm the greatest author in the world.* [7]

> *If you haven't read Fractal Noise or To Sleep, you can read them in either order. It doesn't matter. I would say if you want something that's more similar to what I normally write, read To Sleep first. It may be a better introduction to the universe. If you're up for something shorter and a little more intense, then just go for Fractal Noise.* [10]

> *Fractal Noise is actually a prequel to To Sleep in a Sea of Stars. It is set twenty three years prior, but there are no carryovers with the characters. It is essentially a standalone, sort of exploring an event that's mentioned in To Sleep in a Sea of Stars* [8] *The only connection really is that the main character of this book was an inspiration for Kira in To Sleep.* [2]

> *Even though Fractal Noise and To Sleep may seem slightly disconnected, they are building towards something larger. Fractal Noise is actually setting the stage of the big book that comes after To Sleep.* [4] *We didn't mark To Sleep as ""book one in the Fractalverse series"" because I'm going to assemble the series in bits and bobs.* [7]",2,1758114081.0,Fractalverse,1,1.0,False

With running my own business, I have more flexible schedule, which has given me the opportunity to connect with new people with my free time and for us to get to know one another. I have met some good people on here but yet someone where we both naturally click and effortlessly get along, especially after a few days. I am looking for a relaxed/chill yet engaging conversation. I am someone who puts in the effort into the conversation and looking for someone who will reciprocate.I appreciate long, thoughtful messages or dedicated time where we give eachother our full attention. You can be from anywhere. Whether it's long or short term, I'm open to both, but something longer, a lasting meaningful connection would be great 😊

A bit about me, my personality and interests: I would say my standout feature is my three adorable puppies. Photos will be on a selective basis if you impress me enough 😋; I have a passion for cooking and baking; and I love exploring different cultures, especially through their cuisines. I find solace in hiking and nature (with good company is always a welcomed bonus ) to escape the chaos of daily life. I am great at conversing when I really click with someone and prioritize maintaining mental and physical health. A good cup of coffee and a cosy cafe is my go to. I also love design in many things and enjoy activities such as writing more recently, caring for plants, interior design and my work amongst other things.

If I have piqued your interest, you think we could have a great connection or the mention of puppies won you over, feel free to send me a message introducing yourself. I often am flooded with inappropriate/creepy messages, just know it will result in you being blocked. And to those who read to the end thank you for taking your time to do so, I hope you are healthy, happy and safe. If you are not, I hope you get there. Keep trying your best! If YOUR best is not good enough for someone, that is their problem, not yours. People will complain no matter what. If the post is up, I am still looking for that someone :)",1,1758114049.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

On the other hand, I had some interviews with top-tech companies in my country, and couldn't pass the project they gave me because I didn't know docker, readme, unit tests etc..

I received so much comments of people giving me advice on how to set boundaries with her. 

Since then, so much happened. They crossed boundaries many times causing me and my SO to argue a lot. But it is a story for another time because it doesn’t have anything to do with my pregnancy. 

But I wanted to update you because I stood up for myself when she tried once again to touch me. 
So last week, my in laws come home for a coffee. We are sitting at the dining room table and my MIL asks if I can feel the baby move already. I tell her yes but just like flutters. Only I can feel, since I am only 17 weeks along. 
When it is time for them to go she waits until my FIL and fiance are outside to come back inside because she « forgot » to kiss me goodbye. 
I see her hand reaching for my belly. And then she asks « Can I touch ? ». I was so surprised because it happened so fast and I had a disgusted look on my face 😂 it wasn’t on purpose I just didn’t control it okay ? And I said to her « No I don’t like being touched » 
She looked so shocked like she didn’t expect me to say no. She laughed, visibly embarrassed and replied « ohh yeah that’s why I prefer to ask first » 

Ok but then why did you touch me without asking last time ???

My partner is a very active at home chef and bakes *a lot* and has for years. We are currently renovating our kitchen space and I built a new island in the center with a butcher block top.

We have not finished it yet, ultimately we would like it to match our dark wood in the kitchen we so are looking at possibly a food safe dye from coffee grounds and teas (I have done this before on other projects) or just using a gel stain like I usually do and sealing it.

As a finish I'd be using a tung oil finish such as Water Lox in satin hoping a lower sheet takes a better beating. I know it's not  technically food safe because of the driers added but making some small concessions in the field of ""once dry most surfaces are food contact safe, not food grade"" eg cant peel it up and eat it but safe for food contact.

The surface as far as a baking workspace would only be using a bread scraper. My partner thinks the finish will last if I do as described but I am on the side that scraping will wear down the finish quickly and leave the ""working side"" abraded and scraped up pretty quickly.

But this is where the issue starts this is a large island that has seating so I don't want to just treat the whole thing with mineral oil and wax constantly. We do that with a small butcher block and it gets neglected so I know the island would. Additionally there will at times be a laptop, items, or mail/papers sitting on it and the oil/wax would surely leech into it.

We have played with a lot of ideas to balance this out but are having a hard time.

One of my other ideas was to put a wooden border where they will work with a small 1x1 or 2x2 strip and make the area where they work more just a mineral oil and wax finish ... but then we can't stain it really and the sheen will be noticeably different but I think this might be the concession we have to make.

Id love to hear of other solutions or thoughts on this from anyway.

Thanks in advance sorry for the long read and I can't TLDR it too well but...

TLDR: Need strong abrasion resistant food safe finish for large multi purpose kitchen island (bread scraper)",1,1758113813.0,HomeImprovement,1,1.0,False

Mom Gave Away My Precious Gemstones,"Recently, my Mom gave away a whole protective container full of semi precious and precious gemstones that I had been storing at her house to a 3-year-old who said they liked collecting rocks (I admit—if they’re in her house, I guess I really have no say, but I rent and she owns, and my rental has sparse storage options, so I had asked if I could keep them at her house), some of which I had saved up for a long time to buy, a few of which I either mined myself or ordered directly from the mine they came from, with paperwork and everything, and worse yet, a few of them came from a dear loved one who has since passed on due to mental illness. 

 When I calmly mentioned to her that I would appreciate being asked before anything of mine is given away, and told if she’d prefer that I not keep things at her house, rather than having her just give away my stuff, she told me “okay, then go fight a three year old for them.” 

 I said I think you know I’m not going to do that, and I would like an answer as to whether the boundary I just put out there is acceptable to you, regarding whether and when it’s okay to give away anything of mine that I had asked to store at your house. She just kind of rolled her eyes and said I was being extra. Meanwhile, she gave away thousands of dollars of precious and semi precious uncut gemstones to a toddler. She sent me a video of him saying thank you too. I was like wtf…? I’m glad he’s enjoying them, but what the hell? 

 I swear, there is a generational gap when it comes to boundaries and appropriate communication. I’m a millennial and she’s a baby boomer. But that aside—I know many awesome boomers so don’t come for me too hard—am I overreacting here? I’m kinda broken up about this—especially the stones that had more than monetary value, and the ironic thing is that she had JUST gotten done lecturing me on “being careful with finances,” out of the blue, literally telling me I “spend too much on coffee.” 

 I’m thinking…I know you’re not the same entire person who just got done lecturing me about the value of a dollar, giving away thousands in semi precious and precious gemstones to a freaking toddler (and seriously-I am glad he is enjoying them—with appropriate supervision from his parents, but damn…).

 So I need a reality check, friends. I’m not freaking out or anything, though I’ll admit to having cried about losing the only gifts I still have from my deceased bestie, but I was calm when I mentioned this to my Mom, I didn’t raise my voice or become emotional with her, I just asked a couple of times with as yet no reply if she could please respect the boundary I just set, regarding items I had previously asked her for permission to store at her house, up to and including those gemstones.

At this point, I was too deep in the lie. He just nodded slowly, probably deciding I was some secret fruit enthusiast.

I went home later and Googled “banana festivals” just to check if I had accidentally predicted one. Nope. Still nothing.

Also, facing Toronto in the ALDS - while tough - would at least be a familiar foe we recently took two of three from. With a sweep or a 3-1 series, we could win at Yankee Stadium.

We’re also in a position to possibly have home field advantage for the WS if we advance that far; we have a better record than two of the NL teams, and are tied with the Dodgers (with Cubs in reach!)

Understanding Tooth Sensitivity: What Causes the Pain?

Tooth sensitivity occurs when the protective layers of your teeth become compromised, exposing the underlying dentin and nerve endings. Several factors can contribute to this condition:

• Enamel erosion
• Receding gums
• Tooth decay
• Cracked teeth
• Dental procedures
• Aggressive brushing
• Acidic food and drink consumption

Common Triggers of Dental Sensitivity

Different stimuli can cause significant discomfort for individuals with sensitive teeth:

1. Temperature changes
2. Sweet or acidic foods
3. Brushing and flossing
4. Cold air exposure
5. Dental treatments

• Conduct comprehensive oral examinations
• Perform sensitivity tests

• Assess overall dental health
• Develop personalized treatment plans

Effective Treatment Options for Tooth Sensitivity

Lupin - He'd probably teach History or Chemistry, or both (he's smart all around, but those seem to be the two areas he's most interested in and the ones he infodumps about the most in the series; he's the cool charismatic teacher that is very enthusiastic [and sometimes pretty chaotic too] while giving his classes and everyone loves being his student; he will probably ""annoy"" Jigen, Goemon and Zenigata or try to flirt with Fujiko during break time; kinda dislikes the most monotonous part of the job [such as planning, correcting homework/tests/exams and other paperwork] and can't stay focused on solely that for too long, will probably try to chat with the other teachers [and disturb them while they work on their own stuff] meanwhile)

Fujiko - History (Fujiko seems to like History as some scenes show, as, just like Lupin, she does give some infodumps on History for their robbery plans in the series; a lot of folks have a crush on her, including Lupin; Lupin has definitely used the history and chemistry pick-up line while trying to flirt with her in the teachers' room once)

Jigen - Some first language, aka literature (I dunno, he just gives me some vibes of liking literature; he'd probably teach English as the first language and teach US literature, due to his bias towards the USA that he's already shown in the series; he may be quite harsh and cranky sometimes, but he genuinely cares enough for his students to make sure they pass by their own merit; he would definitely use every school break time for a smoke and appear in the classroom while still drinking a cup of coffee; either takes ages to correct tests/exams or does it all in one day [and he pulled an all-nighter for that, he might be overall a bit sleep-deprived]; despite his and Goemon's energy contrasting a lot with Lupin's, all the three of them surprisingly get along pretty well [just like in the series])

Goemon - Probably either Philosophy or Religion (especially Buddhism and Shinto for the last one), or both (stoic as always; has a quite unconventional and perhaps more practical way of teaching; is also pretty demanding, but, unlike Jigen, he's not cranky, he's just strict on the way he gives his classes; is a surprisingly good adviser and can give his students some life-changing perspectives about the world and life in general; despite his and Jigen's energy contrasting a lot with Lupin's, all the three of them surprisingly get along pretty well [just like in the series])

Zenigata - Either Maths or a foreign language (most likely Japanese or English as a second/third language; he can be a bit boring on his classes, and thus might not be very liked by some students due to that, but he genuinely loves teaching what he teaches and is literally trying his best; loves seeing his students showing actual interest on his classes and gets awfully happy when that happens; he's initially way too proud for that, but he eventually might ask Lupin for some advice on how to get his students more invested every now and then; Lupin does gladly give some advice on that when asked, although he may do it in a quite teasing and playful way)",0,1758112741.0,lupinthe3rd,0,0.5,False

When I was younger, I was concerned about hitting such milestones as it was something that my family and friends talked about frequently, but it had never been in my heart to want to be with someone physically or emotionally. I love platonic friendship! I know and have been told that I'm attractive and have been pursued, but I never wanted it to go any further. This has caused me to lose a lot of male friends, unfortunately. After my friend Sara went through a pretty rough break up I promised her that I would enter the dating field with her to support her future pursuit, but I didn't think she would take it seriously.

Enter Date 1, Grant (28M). Upon Sara moving back in town, she invited me to a singles night where I would serve as her wing woman. Once getting there, Sara had an unfortunate case of diarrhea leading to me being alone on the floor. I was quickly approached by Grant. We shared the same music interests and were really interested in the arts. Conversation was good, but once again I felt nothing. He asked me out and I said yes as at that time Sam had finally come back and squeezed my arm upon hearing the ask. I also am a people pleaser. The date was nice and he was a great conversationalist, but felt that he wanted to trauma bond and was putting on a show in a way. He also was sort of a yes man too. We both mutually decided to stay friends, which has been great!

Enter Date 2, Alex (27M). Months later my friends and I had a pretty rough night in which they discussed their dating lives. I love supporting them and giving advice, but I always tell them to take my points with a grain of salt given my lack of interest and experience in the dating sphere. A part of me felt detached in a way so I decided to download Hinge to really see how bad the field was. It was decent. It was human. No one is perfect. I was asked out immediately by Alex to go get ice cream. He was interesting and I could tell was mostly physically attracted to me. He didn't ask a lot of questions, similar to Grant actually, and said that my interests were different and he's never interacted with anyone like me before. Said interests were going to coffee shops, reading books, and volunteering. I know, very basic activities, which is why I was a bit annoyed. He also never went 5 minutes without applying lip balm lol. He was very adamant about wanting nothing to do with making friends and was there for romance which I respected. After telling him I wasn't interested the next day, I was blocked.

Enter Date 3, Simon (26M), aka the awakening I think. Before even going on the date with Alex, I met Simon in person around my birthday. I really liked his outfit and complimented him to which he did the same. I also noticed him at a bar that I frequent. He actually did match with me on Hinge, but I deleted my account maybe three days after initially downloading it as I grew bored. After going to Grant's art show, my friend's and I ended up at the same bar again where I saw my older brother and a few people that attended an event I hosted the day before. During the conversation, Simon asked to squeeze by and upon locking eyes I became a bit awkward as I kind of technically ghosted him even though we never exchanged words on the app. Turns out he's actually friends with my brother and he introduced the both of us even though we technically knew each other already. My friends noticed how he was staring at me for the rest of the night but never approached only asking if the cake I had gotten was any good before I left. After getting home, I noticed that he followed me on IG. I posted a couple pics on my story from the night that he liked. I replied saying that it was nice finally meeting him and asked how the cake was. He said he didn't get a chance to get said cake and wanted to make up for it by taking me out for cheesecake. I said yes.

It was at a really fancy restaurant that I had been wanting to go to for awhile. The ambiance was great and the food was pretty good as well. Our conversation was natural and easy. It almost felt like I was talking to myself. I felt myself getting aroused at some point even though there was nothing sexual about our interaction. The bartenders were hovering around us sharing soft smiles and when he took a bathroom break the girls gave me a thumbs up which was nice. We were leaving and the host actually stopped us to compliment how we looked together which was sweet. He was very articulate, poetic, passionate about his craft, emotionally aware, puts his words into action, asked a lot of questions, and never interrupted me when I was speaking. He walked me to my car, confessing how stunning he found me and that he was completely in awe of me. I found myself blushing. I couldn't sleep that night. The next morning he expressed how natural and easy the night felt and sent me a very lovely song. I listened to it on repeat. I truly did not expect to like him this fast, but here we are. I don't exactly know how to navigate this feeling as it is genuinely so new to me. We didn't talk/text yesterday as it was the start of the work week. I had a really busy day and I'm sure he did as well. My friends are more excited than me it seems and are a bit upset he hasn't set up a second date yet despite saying he wants to see me again.

So sorry for the length but wanted to share.

**TL;DR:** I’ve never really been interested in romance and mostly value platonic friendships, though I’ve been pursued before. I only started dating to support a friend after her breakup. Date 1 (Grant, 28M) was nice but felt forced; we agreed to stay friends. Date 2 (Alex, 27M) was more physical attraction but no depth, and he blocked me when I said I wasn’t interested. Date 3 (Simon, 26M) felt completely different; natural conversation, mutual attraction, genuine connection. I wasn’t expecting to like him this quickly, but I do, and it’s new/overwhelming for me. My friends are hyped, but I’m still figuring out how to navigate it.",1,1758112315.0,u_Individual-Most-3036,0,1.0,False
1njbuaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1njbuaf/how_do_i_set_boundaries_around_money_in_college/,How do I set boundaries around money in college relationships without coming off as “cheap”?,"I’m in college and honestly starting to think relationships here are just a money trap.

When I started dating my ex, it felt normal to cover little things. A coffee run, Uber rides to parties, and sometimes splitting books. But it slowly turned into me paying for almost everything. Whenever we went out, it was me covering dinner. Whenever her friends tagged along, somehow I ended up footing the bill. Even random Amazon orders for “stuff we needed” came through my card.

I told myself it was fine because I cared about her, but the truth is it started tanking my budget. I was juggling rent, food, and school expenses already, and still felt guilty saying no when she asked for more. Every time I tried to bring it up, it turned into a fight about how I was being “cheap” or “unsupportive.”

The breaking point was when she asked me to pay for her textbook bundle, $300, while I was literally late on my utility bill. That was the moment I realised I was basically just an ATM in her eyes. I ended it, but now I’m left with a wrecked budget and a pile of stress I’m still digging out of.

How do you set financial boundaries in dating, especially in college, without being labelled as selfish or cheap? I don’t want to avoid dating altogether, but I also don’t want to repeat this dynamic again.",3,1758112311.0,dating_advice,9,1.0,False

I (F23) and my boyfriend (M23) have been together for around 4 years and we got together after high school ended. We went to university in different continents so we were long distance from the start and are still working in different countries. When we were in our hometown we only met up by sneaking to go out for lunch or coffee and kiss a little coz our parents weren't cool with us dating so young (yes, we were 18+ but given our asian culture, our parents are a little strict and didnt fully approve). 

He came to visit me at university 2 years into dating, which is the first time we had stayed with each other and had the chance to be intimate and we were nervouse and excited as we have never done anything sexual with anyone else. We were a little nauseous after making out (we googled it, its an actual thing to be nauseous as this was the first time we made out multiple times 1-2 days in a row) so when he tried going down on me, he was there for a few secs and ran to the washroom and THREW UP. He said it was because he was very nauseous and he forced himself to go down on me because my period was due the next day and so he wouldnt be able to do anything for me. Since then I became extremely insecure about him taking my pants off for him because of the fact that he threw up. (I can sense the comments a mile away, I assure everyone im a very hygienic person and I also drank a ton of water and pineapple juice to ensure it didnt smell or taste weird) I did a lot for him with my hands and mouth, not because he asked me to, but because i liked that doing it gave him pleasure (even though it was not very pleasant to suck it lmao) 

He came back to visit me after a few months and I wasn't supposed to get my period while he was there, in fact I was ovulating so I was eager to see what we could do. I noticed that once the mood set in, he would indicate for me to blow him or touch him down there and once he would finish, he would just go to clean himself up and not even mention doing anything for me. After 3 days I was properly upset at him because it just felt like he wanted me to give him pleasure but he had no intention to do the same for me and I felt very used. When I told him, he apologised and few hours later when we were intimate (i was ovulating please dont judge lmao) he started to do stuff but I could see there was no interest on his face. He had a very blank stare and it just seemed like he was forcing himself because of what I said. He couldn't make me finish because he kept stopping when it was getting good because his hand hurt lmao. Apart from that, he only touched me down there 2 hours before he was supposed to leave for the airport, again bcoz he said he was feeling guilty. I have made it clear that I didnt like the way he made me feel insecure and i felt like he used me for his pleasure and he apologised and said its not true.

 We haven't slept together yet but he keeps talking about it but he doesn't mention doing anything for me at all. This past month, we both were at our hometown for a few weeks. His parents weren't in town, but he had other relatives staying at his house. I used to come visit him at his house and we used to make out with the door closed because they were always at home. But whenever I touched his pants, he never hesitated to take them off and make me touch him till he finished. He would just touch my crotch over my jeans and stare at me with a weird look, trying to turn me on (didnt work lmao) and then would kiss me. I told him that what he is doing isn't working for me so he would dry hump me instead.

 A week ago he went back to work and im still at my parents' place for the time being, but i realised that he never even bothered to ask if he can touch me down there. Despite people being at home, we used to be behind closed doors for upto 3-4 hours at a stretch so its not like we didnt have the time. When I confronted him, he said he knew that he didnt offer but didnt tell me because it ""would be embarrassing"" and said that he didnt want to risk me making noise as a female does while they finish. I called bullshit because his reasoning made zero sense and I laughed and said that he has never ever made me finish, so what was he worried about and he got VERY offended. I dont know if I am wrong but I feel very hurt and very used that around 7 out of 10 times when we met he would finish but he wouldn't even ask me if I was in the mood or if he can touch me down there. He liked touching my chest but that's about it. 

I still love him very much and hes a good boyfriend and I want to marry him but i cant help but feel disregarded and kind of worried that our sex life wont be good. Am I the jerk?

New to the subreddit here, but over the past couple of flights I've experienced being quite anxious and the nauseous feeling that comes with it. Never used to be like this, I can happily tolerate turbulence, take off, a rough landing etc. It's the actually general chunk of the journey that's rough. Unsure of what's going on here, I was hoping you veterans have some pointers.

I've been recently having coffees before flights as they've all be early morning ones with a semi large breakfast. Not sure if the caffeine has something to do with it lol.

Any ideas?

When I started dating my ex, it felt normal to cover little things. A coffee run, Uber rides to parties, sometimes splitting books. But it slowly turned into me paying for almost everything. Whenever we went out, it was me covering dinner. Whenever her friends tagged along, somehow I ended up footing the bill. Even random Amazon orders for “stuff we needed” came through my card.

I told myself it was fine because I cared about her, but the truth is it started tanking my budget. I was juggling rent, food, and school expenses already, and still felt guilty saying no when she asked for more. Every time I tried to bring it up, it turned into a fight about how I was being “cheap” or “unsupportive.”

The breaking point was when she asked me to pay for her textbook bundle, $300 while I was literally late on my utility bill. That was the moment I realised I was basically just an ATM in her eyes. I ended it, but now I’m left with a wrecked budget and a pile of stress I’m still digging out of.

How do you set financial boundaries in dating, especially in college, without being labelled as selfish or cheap? I don’t want to avoid dating altogether, but I also don’t want to repeat this dynamic again.

What it lets you do:

* Run repeatable prompt sequences without babysitting the tab
* Batch tasks while you code, review, or step away
* Keep runs consistent and reproducible with the same steps each time

I needed a tool to advance my project overnight while I wasn't working, but couldn't find anything suitable, so I built this. It's quite handy, i mainly have it follow tasks from a [todo.md](http://todo.md) file, and in the morning I fix whatever needs correction.

1njbk6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1njbk6m/i_27f_think_my_partner_29m_is_emotionally_abusive/,I (27F) think my partner (29M) is emotionally abusive,"So for context ive been with my partner around 19 months just shy of our 2 year mark. Everything in the beginning was lovely he did everything right said the right things. We moved in together and have lived together just over a year. In this time he keeps quitting his jobs putting the financial burden on me to pay the bills while hes inbetween work which can last months. The last time he quit he was fully expecting me to pay all the bills and do all the housework as he was depressed. I got him into therapy and hes now on medication for depression and doing a lot better but at this time he had no desire to work again and just decided without asking me that i was gonna support us and all he was gonna do was smoke weed and play computer games. He also fully expected me to pay for his weed and i stated i wasn’t going to do that which made him get another job once he realised i wasn’t funding his drug habit.

Since starting the new job, he keeps saying he’s too tired to help me with house jobs and i should do them because i work in a office and can work from home twice a week and he works in a kitchen. I tried to talk to him about how i was getting run down working full time, doing all the house work and looking after 5 cats but he decided to tell me he’ll pay me money instead of listening to my feelings and acknowledging how burnt out i am from having to do everything.

So the emotional abuse. Theres things he says to me that is making me feel emotionally neglected in this relationship and every time i try to bring up something i don’t like he accuses me of ‘starting an argument’ so that ill shut up or he turns it around on me and blames me and makes me feel horrible instead. Heres some things ive kept a list of in the last two weeks thats he’s said and done to me.

1.  forgot i said i was going to my friends house, i said to him “i did tell you” he started going off on how i was being snarky turned it around on me and said i should know how to speak to people considering how i grew up with my mam (my mam was physically abusive for my entire childhood until i left home.)

I told him about my past in confidence and he threw it back in my face to hurt me and laughed it off like a joke just because he didnt like the way i said something.

2. Poured energy drink on me while i was in the bath just to get a reaction and he laughed at me when i was clearly agitated by it

3. Didnt want to hear about my day as it didnt involve him so didnt concern him and he doesnt like my friend so was only asking to be polite but wasnt actually interested (his exact words). this happens a lot and now i dont feel like i can even speak to him as i know hes not interested unless the conversation revolves around him but he complains to me saying im too quiet.

4. Cannot have opinions around him as he always disagrees with me to make him seem smarter. Sick of not being able to express my true thoughts and opinions not that he cares anyway

5. have to always watch what i say around him especially my tone of voice as he verbally attacks me when he doesn’t like it

6. I do all the house work and work full time. All he does is smoke weed and play games on days off and after work.
He makes me wake him up every morning and i expects me to have his morning coffee ready every day. Most times i dont even get a good morning all he says is “wheres my coffee?”

7. We’re not intimate hardly ever at all. We have sex once a month and usually only for his gratification and i feel unsatisfied and used by the end of it. Theres love or connection in the act. 

8. Challenged me for being low, said if i have depression i need to sort it out as hes not sitting with a depressed girlfriend who wont talk 

This one hits harder as i helped him through his mental health and he made me feel like mine is a problem he cant be bothered with

9. He threw a chair at the wall and out a hole in it because i said i didnt want to play computer games with him. At the time he asked i was busy cleaning the flat which he jabbed at me saying was dirty and he had no clothes to wear so i was cleaning and doing laundry 

I know when i type this is emotional abuse but he brushes it off and acts like it never happened and feel like im going crazy imagining it but my feelings are real and im not being supported emotionally like i need to be
