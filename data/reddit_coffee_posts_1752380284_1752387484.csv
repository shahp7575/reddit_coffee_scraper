1lylseh,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1lylseh/i_stopped_chasing_later/,I Stopped Chasing Later,"Mormonism, to me, is about priding yourself on the things you give up, abstain from, postpone, or deny to cash in for some great reward at a later time. When I think about the term ""Latter-day Saint,"" I no longer think about saints in these days. I think about a really tragic scenario where you have a bunch of people refusing to feel okay about life right now because they believe the next one will be better.

When I was first leaving Mormonism, I was really hesitant but excited to try things like my first cup of coffee. What does wine taste like? What's all the hype? You know what I didn't expect, though? The biggest thing I wasn't allowed to experience as a believing member had nothing to do with some forbidden substance or liquid. The biggest thing I wasn't allowed to experience was what it felt like to be content. To have actual peace. Not the ""let's dress up in robes and go whisper to each other in a Marriott hotel lobby we call a celestial room"" kind of peace. I mean actual, ""wow, this moment in my life is actually pretty okay"" kind of peace. I'm talking ""hey, I'm really kind of a good person"" kind of peace. I'm not talking about the ""wow, I met all my key indicators on my mission"" peace. Or the ""that was awkward, but at least I can report 100% home teaching"" peace. I mean the ""I don't know what happens after this life, if anything, and I'm okay with that"" kind of peace.

These aren't ""latter-day"" saints. These are ""later day"" saints. It's never about today. The happiness is always a carrot on a stick that comes later. For now, it's shame and suffering. You know what word totally disappeared from my vocabulary when I left Mormonism? ""Trials."" I stopped looking for them because I no longer need to find some heavenly reason for why I feel so shitty. I also stopped using the word ""miracles"" as well, to extrude some normal occurrence into a significant heavenly intervention to feel some kind of meaning.

I no longer feel shitty. I have meaning. That's by far the biggest thing I was missing out on. I'm so glad I'm a ""today"" kind of guy now and don't have to keep telling myself things will be okay later.",1,1752387414.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

1. Prove my worth that I’m deserving Level B?
2. Accept Level A but to have salary that match my current draw?
3. Reject the offer
4. any other suggestions???


Context

3 months ago:

• Applied for a role where the MCF listing reflected a salary range I was comfortable with.

• Got an offer (Level A), but was told my expected salary was out of range as the MCF figure included CPF (I assume ~117% of base).

• The maximum they could offer was already below my current salary — this was communicated to HR.

•I rejected the offer, and HR said they would look for roles that could match my salary band.


1 month ago:

•Received a call and was invited for a coffee chat with higher management.

•Hiring manager shared that the chat went well and they were keen to offer me a newly created role with higher responsibilities (Level B).

•Was informed that this role would come with a higher salary band due to the increased scope.


However:

•Due to internal policies, my years of experience don’t qualify me for the higher-level title. So, the role will still be offered at Level A.

•A ballpark salary figure was shared, which I felt was acceptable given the growth potential.



Recent call with HR:

• I expressed excitement about the new role.

• HR confirmed the salary would be the same as what was offered 3 months ago, and not the amount as shared by hiring manager

• They acknowledged it would be a pay cut compared to my current job.

• I tried to negotiate, but there was zero flexibility.

⸻

TL;DR:
I was re-offered a new role with more responsibilities but at the same lower level and salary as before (which is below my current pay). HR confirmed there’s no room for negotiation due to internal policies.

I know 2 so called (friends) who made in crypto , one I will call Iyan , the other will call Ed .

Iyan used to work in the big 4 , as a consultant, 4 years of experience, then he suddenly came back and started living with his parents at the age of 28. Iyan is extremely cunning he doesn't answer any question with ease , he calculates every answer before replying to me. Anyway he confessed that he had enough of corporate world and is currently living by trading different asset classes . Ofcourse for me it was hard to believe but anyway , few years have passed , and every year I go back home for holidays I meet him . He's dressed like a tramp , never invites me for a coffee , uses his father car , extremely stingy . One night he came to me after smoking weed . He started telling me that his Bitcoin usage came about from ordering illegal drugs on the dark web . Back then mining Bitcoin was easy and affordable. By the end of the night he confessed than he has about 400 bitcoins ( that was 4 years ago ) ! 

Iyan deleted all of his online profiles and literally has no online footprints, I'm shocked to see that someone with such a young age nd wealth doesnt treat himself or his family to anything, he doesn't even travel outside of his own country ! 

Let's go to Ed, Ed has always been known to be bullshiter , brags and talks shit you can hardly take him seriously. But his personality is much more likeable , he's sociable and likes to go out and meet people. 

Ed made it in crypto but its unknown how . He was working odd jobs in dubai, until one day he started being crypto Public relation manager , good for him 

Ed , despite his (millions), doesn't own a house , I asked him about it, he said that banks in dubai need a proof of permanent income , was wondering: doesn't he have enough cash to buy it outright? 

Ed too is by no means generous , he's 35 no home , no car , but likes to show off his crypto events and fake watches. I was shocked to know Ed buys fake designer cloths , just to keep up appearances.

What do Henry's think of these guys spending habits ? They are both on mid 30s, what's the point of their wealth if they don't use it? Why are they so stingy ,, despite the fact that they have won the (lottery) ?

Over and Under synopsis
A contemporary romance 18+

While drowning her sorrows and trying to forget her ex, Austin, Natalie finds herself alone at a local club. A fleeting, almost impossible encounter turns her shattered world upside down. Is the quickest way to get over someone to fall under the arms of this fancy businessman?

Join Natalie and Theodore in this contemporary romance as they navigate past relationships, lingering traumas, and deep-seated insecurities in the search for what it truly means to find your person.

Recommended pairing with this reading: A warm cup of dark rose coffee and a sweet treat to savor the sparks of true love-or, for those with a strong constitution, something stronger to brace for the emotional rollercoaster ahead.

I met him in Kyiv,"When I was in Ukraine, I met a guy who went by u/backcountrydrifter on Reddit. He had a spook vibe, definitely some intel background. A bit manic, intense, but sharp. We were both in Kyiv, and one day over coffee, he went deep on Epstein.

He said Epstein wasn't just some pervert billionaire. He was running a kompromat farm. Everything Epstein built was designed to trap people; private jets, cameras in the walls, teenage bait, even handlers like Ghislaine. The whole thing was a net to gather leverage. Not just for himself, but for someone bigger. Maybe Mossad. Maybe the FSB

Drifter believed Trump was one of the people who got compromised early. Not necessarily as a co-conspirator, but as a target; someone who walked into the trap and never fully got out. He also mentioned RFK Jr. in the same breath, which I found wild at the time. Said both of them had been brought into the circle and were used. He talked like the entire upper tier of global elites were part of this web, some knowingly, some not.

This wasn't your usual Reddit rabbit hole stuff. The guy spoke with precision. Whether he was right or not, I’ve never forgotten that conversation. Curious if anyone else remembers him or heard the same thing. His handle was *BackcountryDrifter*. Said a lot of stuff people weren't ready to hear.

I posted about him before on here. I believe he's still out there. Certainly nuts, but some of the stuff he is said makes sense about Epstein. He's from Utah, as I stated. ",1,1752386548.0,Backcountrydrifter_,0,1.0,False

1lylism,https://www.reddit.com/r/profitec/comments/1lylism/reasons_not_to_buy_profitec_move/,Reasons not to buy Profitec MOVE?,"Hey everyone,

I'm deep down the rabbit hole researching my next espresso machine and I'm heavily leaning towards the Profitec MOVE. I've scourged YouTube and Reddit, but since it's a newer model, detailed long-term reviews are a bit limited.

Currently, I'm using a Bambino Plus paired with a Niche Zero grinder. My daily routine involves one latte and one Americano on weekdays. On weekends, I'll make 2 lattes back-to-back, and occasionally, when friends or family visit, I'll be pulling 2-4 lattes or americanos consecutively.

I don't feel the Profitec Go would be a significant enough upgrade from my Bambino Plus, and I'm really looking for a machine that will reliably serve me for over seven years. My budget is around $2,000 to $2,200.

I've ruled out the Ascaso Steel Duo due to the plug situation – I'm not keen on buying a US market machine that requires a separate converter.

I really like the style and compact size of the Profitec MOVE.

Here are the potential cons I've noted:

Steam Power: I've seen some reviews mention weak steam, though apparently, this can be resolved by switching to a 4-hole tip. As long as it's better than the Bambino Plus, I'll be happy.

Heat-up Time: At around 12 minutes, it's considerably longer than the Bambino Plus. This isn't a huge deal for my morning routine, as I'm usually busy with other tasks like unloading the dishwasher and packing for the kids before making coffee.

Pre-order: I'm fine with waiting, as my Bambino Plus is still fully functional.

Beyond the steam power and heat-up time, are there any other flaws or significant cons of the Profitec MOVE that I should be aware of before placing an order?

Ultimately, my main reason for upgrading is my enjoyment of making lattes, Americanos, and practicing latte art.

I'm also very curious: will the taste difference between shots from a Bambino Plus and the MOVE be genuinely noticeable?

Any insights from current Profitec MOVE owners or those with experience upgrading from a Bambino Plus would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",1,1752386411.0,profitec,0,1.0,False

I chose to run Paper Chase as it's a pretty short scenario overall, and it's shorter. I knew we were going to have to go through character creation as well and CoC was kind of jumped on us a couple of days ago. One of my players is just out of town for this weekend kind of unexpectedly; but situations like this are why I suggested a side campaign of Call of Cthulhu, to have a game instead of canceling. Another reason the scenario worked was I wanted to set a campaign in and around the great lakes and out of Grand Rapids itself, so a scenario I didn't need to modify handouts to take out references to Massachusetts helped in that.

  
The start was simple enough, I asked 'who wants an uncle?' And delivered the news of Douglas's death and their naming in his will when one of the players answered. I put the town to be a little unincorporated community near Traverse City MI. I changed a couple of things around right from the jump though. Thomas was not a friend and the nephew of Douglas, he was kind of the local handyman as well as a gardener in this, to make the scenario a little more personal. I had Thomas fill in as a sounding board for the PCs here, and someone who had known Douglas fairly well before he disappeared, and if they talked to some of the neighbors, which they didn't, the investigators would have been told that Thomas really knew him better than anyone else, and while taking care of the place would stay in the guest room occasionally. The inciting incident though to tell the players something was off was Thomas had stayed in the homes guest room two nights prior, and heard something crash down in the library. Upon his investigation he saw the globe in the library had been knocked over, the window was open, and several books were missing.

  
The PCs decided their first order of business was to see what was missing. An appraiser who had been paid by Douglass's lawyer had actually left a catalog of the library's books as well as an evaluation of their value to there'd be a record of what was all here, and we started with total failures on Library Uses from the players, good start. So a couple hours of figuring things out took like four hours and they figured out it was a handful of random books. An account of the introduction of coffee to the western world, a history book about Greece, The History and Application of the Production and Uses of Grease, and a copy of The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer. They also found that Douglass's most valuable book, a copy of The Canterbury Tales from the mid 18th century, was untouched in the library, and still under glass. After doing this the players felt it was weird, and something to note, and they went into town to get dinner and talk to some locals.

  
Arriving to the house they both turned in and started the next day doing more investigating, where they found some of the shingles on the house had been broken or dislodged, and the signs of this had been cleaned up as the broken shingles just, weren't on the property. They did some searching, looking around, and discovered the pathway to the cemetery. A slight change to the scenario, I made Douglass's favorite reading spot an oddly shaped memorial to a few locals that had died in the Civil War that had a sort of curved section near to the bottom where it was clear some wear had occurred over time, and they figured that it may have been from someone sitting down. They also figured out the way into the ghoul warrens, and for some reason, decided to go down there.

  
The ghoul warrens were pretty neat, and there was some tension to it especially when they both absolutely fumbled navigation checks, and they only had light because the one player who had a flashlight passed her sanity check when they started to hear things in the darkness around them, and see things and shapes at the edge of that single insufficient beam of light against the stygian dark that swallowed them whole. It was pretty fun. The only reason they got out was the ghouls actually herding them from the shadows to another entrance, and despite having a gun, nobody started blasting randomly.

  
Eventually finding a hatch above with a bit of light showing through cracks the players struggled, and pushed a roll to open it from the inside. The two were then promptly called grave robbers, and got a hard kicking from the church's handyman. After some absolutely blown fast talks and persuade attempts though, he was about to beat them with a shovel before kicking one of them and telling them to run off now, as he believed nothing and assumed them to be grave robbers still. After coming home they both decided to just shower and figure out what to do in the morning.

  
Cut to the middle of the night, both characters who were asleep passed their hard listen checks and were woken up by sounds from the library. The two botched their stealths to get to the door and just ran after the sound to find Douglas, partially turned and stuffing books in a bag and making for a window. After sanity loss was accounted for, and nobody jumped to attack him, they talked to Douglas, and learned what had happened. Learned about the meeting with the ghoul, and they talked and eventually just, let him take his books. He did two things for them though. Firstly, he told them that after this meeting and the investigators stumbling into the warrens, the ghouls will be collapsing the tunnels and moving. And that there are great and terrible truths to the world, handing his niece a copy of a book he took with him when he disappeared. Nameless Cults.

Upon Douglas leaving for the last time, the two slept uneasily, and the house was put up for sale with an agent.

  
Overall it was a lot of fun, and pretty smooth to go through, and we didn't hit any major snags along the way. I can definitely see why it's in the starter set.",1,1752386375.0,callofcthulhu,0,1.0,False

1lylcd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lylcd1/odd_thomas_by_dean_koontz/,Odd Thomas  by Dean Koontz:,"ONE  
  
  MY NAME IS ODD THOMAS, THOUGH IN THIS AGE when fame is the altar at which most people worship, I am not sure why you should care who I am or that I exist.  
  
  I am not a celebrity. I am not the child of a celebrity. I have never been married to, never been abused by, and never provided a kidney for transplantation into any celebrity. Furthermore, I have no desire to be a celebrity.  
  
  In fact I am such a nonentity by the standards of our culture that People magazine not only will never feature a piece about me but might also reject my attempts to subscribe to their publication on the grounds that the black-hole gravity of my noncelebrity is powerful enough to suck their entire enterprise into oblivion.  
  
  I am twenty years old. To a world-wise adult, I am little more than a child. To any child, however, I’m old enough to be distrusted, to be excluded forever from the magical community of the short and beardless.  
  
  Consequently, a demographics expert might conclude that my sole audience is other young men and women currently adrift between their twentieth and twenty-first birthdays.  
  
  In truth, I have nothing to say to that narrow audience. In my experience, I don’t care about most of the things that other twenty-year-old Americans care about. Except survival, of course.  
  
  I lead an unusual life.  
  
  By this I do not mean that my life is better than yours. I’m sure that your life is filled with as much happiness, charm, wonder, and abiding fear as anyone could wish. Like me, you are human, after all, and we know what a joy and terror that is.  
  
  I mean only that my life is not typical. Peculiar things happen to me that don’t happen to other people with regularity, if ever.  
  
  For example, I would never have written this memoir if I had not been commanded to do so by a four-hundred-pound man with six fingers on his left hand.  
  
  His name is P. Oswald Boone. Everyone calls him Little Ozzie because his father, Big Ozzie, is still alive.  
  
  Little Ozzie has a cat named Terrible Chester. He loves that cat. In fact, if Terrible Chester were to use up his ninth life under the wheels of a Peterbilt, I am afraid that Little Ozzie’s big heart would not survive the loss.  
  
  Personally, I do not have great affection for Terrible Chester because, for one thing, he has on several occasions peed on my shoes.  
  
  His reason for doing so, as explained by Ozzie, seems credible, but I am not convinced of his truthfulness. I mean to say that I am suspicious of Terrible Chester’s veracity, not Ozzie’s.  
  
  Besides, I simply cannot fully trust a cat who claims to be fifty-eight years old. Although photographic evidence exists to support this claim, I persist in believing that it’s bogus.  
  
  For reasons that will become obvious, this manuscript cannot be published during my lifetime, and my effort will not be repaid with royalties while I’m alive. Little Ozzie suggests that I should leave my literary estate to the loving maintenance of Terrible Chester, who, according to him, will outlive all of us.  
  
  I will choose another charity. One that has not peed on me.  
  
  Anyway, I’m not writing this for money. I am writing it to save my sanity and to discover if I can convince myself that my life has purpose and meaning enough to justify continued existence.  
  
  Don’t worry: These ramblings will not be insufferably gloomy. P. Oswald Boone has sternly instructed me to keep the tone light.  
  
  “If you don’t keep it light,” Ozzie said, “I’ll sit my four-hundred-pound ass on you, and that’s not the way you want to die.”  
  
  Ozzie is bragging. His ass, while grand enough, probably weighs no more than a hundred and fifty pounds. The other two hundred fifty are distributed across the rest of his suffering skeleton.  
  
  When at first I proved unable to keep the tone light, Ozzie suggested that I be an unreliable narrator. “It worked for Agatha Christie in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,” he said.  
  
  In that first-person mystery novel, the nice-guy narrator turns out to be the murderer of Roger Ackroyd, a fact he conceals from the reader until the end.  
  
  Understand, I am not a murderer. I have done nothing evil that I am concealing from you. My unreliability as a narrator has to do largely with the tense of certain verbs.  
  
  Don’t worry about it. You’ll know the truth soon enough.  
  
  Anyway, I’m getting ahead of my story. Little Ozzie and Terrible Chester do not enter the picture until after the cow explodes.  
  
  This story began on a Tuesday.  
  
  For you, that is the day after Monday. For me, it is a day that, like the other six, brims with the potential for mystery, adventure, and terror.  
  
  You should not take this to mean that my life is romantic and magical. Too much mystery is merely an annoyance. Too much adventure is exhausting. And a little terror goes a long way.  
  
  Without the help of an alarm clock, I woke that Tuesday morning at five, from a dream about dead bowling-alley employees.  
  
  I never set the alarm because my internal clock is so reliabl  
e. If I wish to wake promptly at five, then before going to bed I tell myself three times that I must be awake sharply at 4:45.  
  
  While reliable, my internal alarm clock for some reason runs fifteen minutes slow. I learned this years ago and have adjusted to the problem.  
  
  The dream about the dead bowling-alley employees has troubled my sleep once or twice a month for three years. The details are not yet specific enough to act upon. I will have to wait and hope that clarification doesn’t come to me too late.  
  
  So I woke at five, sat up in bed, and said, “Spare me that I may serve,” which is the morning prayer that my Granny Sugars taught me to say when I was little.  
  
  Pearl Sugars was my mother’s mother. If she had been my father’s mother, my name would be Odd Sugars, further complicating my life.  
  
  Granny Sugars believed in bargaining with God. She called Him “that old rug merchant.”  
  
  Before every poker game, she promised God to spread His holy word or to share her good fortune with orphans in return for a few unbeatable hands. Throughout her life, winnings from card games remained a significant source of income.  
  
  Being a hard-drinking woman with numerous interests in addition to poker, Granny Sugars didn’t always spend as much time spreading God’s word as she promised Him that she would. She believed that God expected to be conned more often than not and that He would be a good sport about it.  
  
  You can con God and get away with it, Granny said, if you do so with charm and wit. If you live your life with imagination and verve, God will play along just to see what outrageously entertaining thing you’ll do next.  
  
  He’ll also cut you some slack if you’re astonishingly stupid in an amusing fashion. Granny claimed that this explains why uncountable millions of breathtakingly stupid people get along just fine in life.  
  
  Of course, in the process, you must never do harm to others in any serious way, or you’ll cease to amuse Him. Then payment comes due for the promises you didn’t keep.  
  
  In spite of drinking lumberjacks under the table, regularly winning at poker with stone-hearted psychopaths who didn’t like to lose, driving fast cars with utter contempt for the laws of physics (but never while intoxicated), and eating a diet rich in pork fat, Granny Sugars died peacefully in her sleep at the age of seventy-two. They found her with a nearly empty snifter of brandy on the nightstand, a book by her favorite novelist turned to the last page, and a smile on her face.  
  
  Judging by all available evidence, Granny and God understood each other pretty well.  
  
  Pleased to be alive that Tuesday morning, on the dark side of the dawn, I switched on my nightstand lamp and surveyed the chamber that served as my bedroom, living room, kitchen, and dining room. I never get out of bed until I know who, if anyone, is waiting for me.  
  
  If visitors either benign or malevolent had spent part of the night watching me sleep, they had not lingered for a breakfast chat. Sometimes simply getting from bed to bathroom can take the charm out of a new day.  
  
  Only Elvis was there, wearing the lei of orchids, smiling, and pointing one finger at me as if it were a cocked gun.  
  
  Although I enjoy living above this particular two-car garage, and though I find my quarters cozy, Architectural Digest will not be seeking an exclusive photo layout. If one of their glamour scouts saw my place, he’d probably note, with disdain, that the second word in the magazine’s name is not, after all, Indigestion.  
  
  The life-size cardboard figure of Elvis, part of a theater-lobby display promoting Blue Hawaii, was where I’d left it. Occasionally, it moves—or is moved—during the night.  
  
  I showered with peach-scented soap and peach shampoo, which were given to me by Stormy Llewellyn. Her real first name is Bronwen, but she thinks that makes her sound like an elf.  
  
  My real name actually is Odd.  
  
  According to my mother, this is an uncorrected birth-certificate error. Sometimes she says they intended to name me Todd. Other times she says it was Dobb, after a Czechoslovakian uncle.  
  
  My father insists that they always intended to name me Odd, although he won’t tell me why. He notes that I don’t have a Czechoslovakian uncle.  
  
  My mother vigorously asserts the existence of the uncle, though she refuses to explain why I’ve never met either him or her sister, Cymry, to whom he is supposedly married.  
  
  Although my father acknowledges the existence of Cymry, he is adamant that she has never married. He says that she is a freak, but what he means by this I don’t know, for he will say no more.  
  
  My mother becomes infuriated at the suggestion that her sister is any kind of freak. She calls Cymry a gift from God but otherwise remains uncommunicative on the subject.  
  
  I find it easier to live with the name Odd than to contest it. By the time I was old enough to realize that it was an unusual name, I had grown comfortable with it.  
  
  Stormy Llewellyn and I are more than friends. We believe that we are soul mates.  
  
  For one thing, we have a card from a carnival fortune-telling machine that says we’re destined to be together forever.  
  
  We also have matching birthmarks.  
  
  Cards and birthmarks aside, I love her intensely. I would throw myself off a high cliff for her if she asked me to jump. I would, of course, need to understand the reasoning behind her request.  
  
  Fortunately for me, Stormy is not the kind of person to ask such a thing lightly. She expects nothing of others that she herself would not do. In treacherous currents, she is kept steady by a moral anchor the size of a ship.  
  
  She once brooded for an entire day about whether to keep fifty cents that she found in the change-return slot of a pay phone. At last she mailed it to the telephone company.  
  
  Returning to the cliff for a moment, I don’t mean to imply that I’m afraid of Death. I’m just not ready to go out on a date with him.  
  
  Smelling like a peach, as Stormy likes me, not afraid of Death, having eaten a blueberry muffin, saying good-bye to Elvis with the words “Taking care of business” in a lousy imitation of his voice, I set off for work at the Pico Mundo Grille.  
  
  Although the dawn had just broken, it had already flash-fried into a hard yellow yolk on the eastern horizon.  
  
  The town of Pico Mundo is in that part of southern California where you can never forget that in spite of all the water imported by the state aqueduct system, the true condition of the territory is desert. In March we bake. In August, which this was, we broil.  
  
  The ocean lay so far to the west that it was no more real to us than the Sea of Tranquility, that vast dark plain on the face of the moon.  
  
  Occasionally, when excavating for a new subdivision of tract homes on the outskirts of town, developers had struck rich veins of seashells in their deeper diggings. Once upon an ancient age, waves lapped these shores.  
  
  If you put one of those shells to your ear, you will not hear the surf breaking but only a dry mournful wind, as if the shell has forgotten its origins.  
  
  At the foot of the exterior steps that led down from my small apartment, in the early sun, Penny Kallisto waited like a shell on a shore. She wore red sneakers, white shorts, and a sleeveless white blouse.  
  
  Ordinarily, Penny had none of that preadolescent despair to which some kids prove so susceptible these days. She was an ebullient twelve-year-old, outgoing and quick to laugh.  
  
  This morning, however, she looked solemn. Her blue eyes darkened as does the sea under the passage of a cloud.  
  
  I glanced toward the house, fifty feet away, where my landlady, Rosalia Sanchez, would be expecting me at any minute to confirm that she had not disappeared during the night. The sight of herself in a mirror was never sufficient to put her fear to rest.  
  
  Without a word, Penny turned away from the stairs. She walked toward the front of the property.  
  
  Like a pair of looms, using sunshine and their own silhouettes, two enormous California live oaks wove veils of gold and purple, which they flung across the driveway.  
  
  Penny appeared to shimmer and to darkle as she passed through this intricate lace of light  
and shade. A black mantilla of shadow dimmed the luster of her blond hair, its elaborate pattern changing as she moved.  
  
  Afraid of losing her, I hurried down the last of the steps and followed the girl. Mrs. Sanchez would have to wait, and worry.  
  
  Penny led me past the house, off the driveway, to a birdbath on the front lawn. Around the base of the pedestal that supported the basin, Rosalia Sanchez had arranged a collection of dozens of the seashells, all shapes and sizes, that had been scooped from the hills of Pico Mundo.  
  
  Penny stooped, selected a specimen about the size of an orange, stood once more, and held it out to me.  
  
  The architecture resembled that of a conch. The rough exterior was brown and white, the polished interior shone pearly pink.  
  
  Cupping her right hand as though she still held the shell, Penny brought it to her ear. She cocked her head to listen, thus indicating what she wanted me to do.  
  
  When I put the shell to my ear, I did not hear the sea. Neither did I hear the melancholy desert wind that I mentioned previously.  
  
  Instead, from the shell came the rough breathing of a beast. The urgent rhythm of a cruel need, the grunt of mad desire.  
  
  Here in the summer desert, winter found my blood.  
  
  When she saw from my expression that I had heard what she wished me to hear, Penny crossed the lawn to the public sidewalk. She stood at the curb, gazing toward the west end of Marigold Lane.  
  
  I dropped the shell, went to her side, and waited with her.  
  
  Evil was coming. I wondered whose face it would be wearing.  
  
  Old Indian laurels line this street. Their great gnarled surface roots have in places cracked and buckled the concrete walkway.  
  
  Not a whisper of air moved through the trees. The morning lay as uncannily still as dawn on Judgment Day one breath before the sky would crack open.  
  
  Like Mrs. Sanchez’s place, most houses in this neighborhood are Victorian in style, with varying degrees of gingerbread. When Pico Mundo was founded, in 1900, many residents were immigrants from the East Coast, and they preferred architectures better suited to that distant colder, damper shore.  
  
  Perhaps they thought they could bring to this valley only those things they loved, leaving behind all ugliness.  
  
  We are not, however, a species that can choose the baggage with which it must travel. In spite of our best intentions, we always find that we have brought along a suitcase or two of darkness, and misery.

  For half a minute, the only movement was that of a hawk gliding high above, glimpsed between laurel branches.  
  
  The hawk and I were hunters this morning.  
  
  Penny Kallisto must have sensed my fear. She took my right hand in her left.  
  
  I was grateful for this kindness. Her grip proved firm, and her hand did not feel cold. I drew courage from her strong spirit.  
  
  Because the car was idling in gear, rolling at just a few miles per hour, I didn’t hear anything until it turned the corner. When I recognized the vehicle, I knew a sadness equal to my fear.  
  
  This 1968 Pontiac Firebird 400 had been restored with loving care. The two-door, midnight-blue convertible appeared to glide toward us with all tires a fraction of an inch off the pavement, shimmering like a mirage in the morning heat.  
  
  Harlo Landerson and I had been in the same high-school class. During his junior and senior years, Harlo rebuilt this car from the axles up, until it looked as cherry as it had in the autumn of ’67, when it had first stood on a showroom floor.  
  
  Self-effacing, somewhat shy, Harlo had not labored on the car with the hope either that it would be a babe magnet or that those who had thought of him as tepid would suddenly think he was cool enough to freeze the mercury in a thermometer. He’d had no social ambitions. He had suffered no illusions about his chances of ever rising above the lower ranks of the high-school caste system.  
  
  With a 335-horsepower V-8 engine, the Firebird could sprint from zero to sixty miles per hour in under eight seconds. Yet Harlo wasn’t a street racer; he took no special pride in having wheels of fury.  
  
  He devoted much time, labor, and money to the Firebird because the beauty of its design and function enchanted him. This was a labor of the heart, a passion almost spiritual in its purity and intensity.  
  
  I sometimes thought the Pontiac figured so large in Harlo’s life because he had no one to whom he could give the love that he lavished on the car. His mom died when he was six. His dad was a mean drunk.  
  
  A car can’t return the love you give it. But if you’re lonely enough, maybe the sparkle of the chrome, the luster of the paint, and the purr of the engine can be mistaken for affection.  
  
  Harlo and I hadn’t been buddies, just friendly. I liked the guy. He was quiet, but quiet was better than the boast and bluster with which many kids jockeyed for social position in high school.  
  
  With Penny Kallisto still at my side, I raised my left hand and waved at Harlo.  
  
  Since high school, he’d worked hard. Nine to five, he unloaded trucks at Super Food and moved stock from storeroom to shelves.  
  
  Before that, beginning at 4:00 A.M., he dropped hundreds of newspapers at homes on the east side of Pico Mundo. Once each week, he also delivered to every house a plastic bag full of advertising flyers and discount-coupon books.  
  
  This morning, he distributed only newspapers, tossing them with a snap of the wrist, as though they were boomerangs. Each folded and bagged copy of the Tuesday edition of the Maravilla County Times spun through the air and landed with a soft thwop on a driveway or a front walk, precisely where the subscriber preferred to have it.  
  
  Harlo was working the far side of the street. When he reached the house opposite me, he braked the coasting Pontiac to a stop.  
  
  Penny and I crossed to the car, and Harlo said, “Good mornin’, Odd. How’re you this fine day?”  
  
  “Bleak,” I replied. “Sad. Confused.”  
  
  He frowned with concern. “What’s wrong? Anything I can do?”  
  
  “Something you’ve already done,” I said.  
  
  Letting go of Penny’s hand, I leaned into the Firebird from the passenger’s side, switched off the engine, and plucked the key from the ignition.  
  
  Startled, Harlo grabbed for the keys but missed. “Hey, Odd, no foolin’ around, okay? I have a tight schedule.”  
  
  I never heard Penny’s voice, but in the rich yet silent language of the soul, she must have spoken to me.  
  
  What I said to Harlo Landerson was the essence of what the girl revealed: “You have her blood in your pocket.”  
  
  An innocent man would have been baffled by my statement. Harlo stared at me, his eyes suddenly owlish not with wisdom but with fear.  
  
  “On that night,” I said, “you took with you three small squares of white felt.”  
  
  One hand still on the wheel, Harlo looked away from me, through the windshield, as if willing the Pontiac to move.  
  
  “After using the girl, you collected some of her virgin blood with the squares of felt.”  
  
  Harlo shivered. His face flushed red, perhaps with shame.  
  
  Anguish thickened my voice. “They dried stiff and dark, brittle like crackers.”  
  
  His shivers swelled into violent tremors.  
  
  “You carry one of them with you at all times.” My voice shook with emotion. “You like to smell it. Oh, God, Harlo. Sometimes you put it between your teeth. And bite on it.”  
  
  He threw open the driver’s door and fled.  
  
  I’m not the law. I’m not vigilante justice. I’m not vengeance personified. I don’t really know what I am, or why.  
  
  In moments like these, however, I can’t restrain myself from action. A kind of madness comes over me, and I can no more turn away from what must be done than I can wish this fallen world back into a state of grace.  
  
  As Harlo burst from the Pontiac, I looked down at Penny Kallisto and saw the ligature marks on her throat, which had not been visible when she had first appeared to me. The depth to which the garroting cloth had scored her flesh revealed the singular fury with which he had strangled her to death.  
  
  Pity tore at me, and I went after Harlo Landerson, for whom I had no pity whatsoever.  
  
  TWO  
  
  BLACKTOP TO CONCRETE, CONCRETE TO GRASS, alongside the house that lay across the street from Mrs. Sanchez’s place, through the rear yard, to a wrought-iron fence and over, then across a narrow alleyway, up a slumpstone wall, Harlo Landerson ran and clambered and flung himself.  
  
  I wondered where he might be going. He couldn’t outrun either me or justice, and he certainly couldn’t outrun who he was.  
  
  Beyond the slumpstone wall lay a backyard, a swimming pool. Dappled with morning light and tree shadows, the water glimmered in shades of blue from sapphire to turquoise, as might a trove of jewels left by long-dead pirates who had sailed a sea since vanished.  
  
  On the farther side of the pool, behind a sliding glass door, a young woman stood in pajamas, holding a mug of whatever brew gave her the courage to face the day.  
  
  When he spotted this startled observer, Harlo changed directions toward her. Maybe he thought he needed a shield, a hostage. Whatever, he wasn’t looking for coffee.  
  
  I closed on him, snared his shirt, hooked him off his feet. The two of us plunged into the deep end of the pool.  
  
  Having banked a summer’s worth of desert heat, the water wasn’t cold. Thousands of bubbles like shimmering showers of silver coins flipped across my eyes, rang against my ears.  
  
  Thrashing, we touched bottom, and on the way up, he kicked, he flailed. With elbow or knee, or foot, he struck my throat.  
  
  Although the impeding water robbed the blow of most of its force, I gasped, swallowed, choked on the taste of chlorine flavored with tanning oil. Losing my grip on Harlo, I tumbled in slow-mo through undulant curtains of green light, blue shadow, and broke the surface into spangles of sunshine.  
  
  I was in the middle of the pool, and Harlo was at the edge. He grabbed the coping and jacked himself onto the concrete deck.  
  
  Coughing, venting atomized water from both nostrils, I splashed noisily after him. As a swimmer, I have less potential for Olympic competition than for drowning.  
  
  On a particularly dispiriting night when I was sixteen, I found myself chained to a pair of dead men and dumped off a boat in Malo Suerte Lake. Ever since then, I’ve had an aversion to aquatic sports.  
  
  That man-made lake lies beyond the city limits of Pico Mundo. Malo Suerte means “bad luck.”  
  
  Constructed during the Great Depression as a proj  
ect of the Works Progress Administration, the lake originally had been named after an obscure politician. Although they have a thousand stories about its treacherous waters, nobody around these parts can quite pin down when or why the place was officially renamed Malo Suerte.  
  
  All records relating to the lake burned in the courthouse fire of 1954, when a man named Mel Gibson protested the seizure of his property for nonpayment of taxes. Mr. Gibson’s protest took the form of self-immolation.  
  
  He wasn’t related to the Australian actor with the same name who would decades later become a movie star. Indeed, by all reports, he was neither talented nor physically attractive.  
  
  Now, because I hadn’t been burdened on this occasion by a pair of men too dead to swim for themselves, I reached the edge of the pool in a few swift strokes. I levered myself out of the water.  
  
  Having arrived at the sliding door, Harlo Landerson found it locked.  
  
  The pajamaed woman had disappeared.  
  
  As I scrambled to my feet and started to move, Harlo backed away from the door far enough to get momentum. Then he ran at it, leading with his left shoulder, his head tucked down.  
  
  I winced in expectation of gouting blood, severed limbs, a head guillotined by a blade of glass.  
  
  Of course the safety pane shattered into cascades of tiny, gummy pieces. Harlo crashed into the house with all his limbs intact and his head still attached to his neck.  
  
  Glass crunched and clinked under my shoes when I entered in his wake. I smelled something burning.  
  
  We were in a family room. All the furniture was oriented toward a big-screen TV as large as a pair of refrigerators.  
  
  The gigantic head of the female host of the Today show was terrifying in such magnified detail. In these dimensions, her perky smile had the warmth of a barracuda’s grin. Her twinkly eyes, here the size of lemons, seemed to glitter maniacally.  
  
  In this open floor plan, the family room flowed into the kitchen with only a breakfast bar intervening.  
  
  The woman had chosen to make a stand in the kitchen. She gripped a telephone in one hand and a butcher knife in the other.  
  
  Harlo stood at the threshold between rooms, trying to decide if a twentysomething housewife in too-cute, sailor-suit pajamas would really have the nerve to gut him alive.  
  
  She brandished the knife as she shouted into the phone. “He’s inside, he’s right here!”  
  
  Past her, on a far counter, smoke poured from a toaster. Some kind of pop-up pastry had failed to pop. It smelled like strawberries and smoldering rubber. The lady was having a bad morning.  
  
  Harlo threw a bar stool at me and ran out of the family room, toward the front of the house.  
  
  Ducking the stool, I said, “Ma’am, I’m sorry about the mess,” and I went looking for Penny’s killer.  
  
  Behind me, the woman screamed, “Stevie, lock your door! Stevie, lock your door!”  
  
  By the time I reached the foot of the open stairs in the foyer, Harlo had climbed to the landing.  
  
  I saw why he had been drawn upward instead of fleeing the house: At the second floor stood a wide-eyed little boy, about five years old, wearing only undershorts. Holding a blue teddy bear by one of its feet, the kid looked as vulnerable as a puppy stranded in the middle of a busy freeway.  
  
  Prime hostage material.  
  
  “Stevie, lock your door!”  
  
  Dropping the blue bear, the kid bolted for his room.  
  
  Harlo charged up the second flight of stairs.  
  
  Sneezing out the tickle of chlorine and the tang of burning strawberry jam, dripping, squishing, I ascended with somewhat less heroic flair than John Wayne in Sands of Iwo Jima.  
  
  I was more scared than my quarry because I had something to lose, not least of all Stormy Llewellyn and our future together that the fortune-telling machine had seemed to promise. If I encountered a husband with a handgun, he’d shoot me as unhesitatingly as he would Harlo.  
  
  Overhead, a door slammed hard. Stevie had done as his mother instructed.  
  
  If he’d had a pot of boiling lead, in the tradition of Quasimodo, Harlo Landerson would have poured it on me. Instead came a sideboard that evidently had stood in the second-floor hall, opposite the head of the stairs.  
  
  Surprised to discover that I had the agility and the balance of a monkey, albeit a wet monkey, I scrambled off the stairs, onto the railing. The deadfall rocked past step by step, drawers gaping open and snapping shut repeatedly, as if the furniture were possessed by the spirit of a crocodile.  
  
  Off the railing, up the stairs, I reached the second-floor hall as Harlo began to break down the kid’s bedroom door.  
  
  Aware that I was coming, he kicked harder. Wood splintered with a dry crack, and the door flew inward.  
  
  Harlo flew with it, as if he’d been sucked out of the hall by an energy vortex.  
  
  Rushing across the threshold, pushing aside the rebounding door, I saw the boy trying to wriggle under the bed. Harlo had seized him by the left foot.  
  
  I snatched a smiling panda-bear lamp off the red nightstand and smashed it over Harlo’s head. A ceramic carnage of perky black ears, fractured white face, black paws, and chunks of white belly exploded across the room.  
  
  In a world where biological systems and the laws of physics functioned with the absolute dependability that scientists claim for them, Harlo would have dropped stone-cold unconscious as surely as the lamp shattered. Unfortunately, this isn’t such a world.  
  
  As love empowers some frantic mothers to find the superhuman strength to lift overturned cars to free their trapped children, so depravity gave Harlo the will to endure a panda pounding without significant effect. He let go of Stevie and rounded on me.  
  
  Although his eyes lacked elliptical pupils, they reminded me of the eyes of a snake, keen with venomous intent, and though his bared teeth included no hooked or dramatically elongated canines, the rage of a rabid jackal gleamed in his silent snarl.  
  
  This wasn’t the person whom I had known in high school so few years ago, not the shy kid who found magic and meaning in the patient restoration of a Pontiac Firebird.  
  
  Here was a diseased and twisted bramble of a soul, thorny and cankerous, which perhaps until recently had been imprisoned in a deep turning of Harlo’s mental labyrinth. It had broken down the bars of its cell and climbed up through the castle keep, deposing the man who had been Harlo; and now it ruled.  
  
  Released, Stevie squirmed all the way under his bed, but no bed offered shelter to me, and I had no blankets to pull over my head.  
  
  I can’t pretend that I remember the next minute with clarity. We struck at each other when we saw an opening. We grabbed anything that might serve as a weapon, swung it, flung it. A flurry of blows staggered both of us into a clinch, and I felt his hot breath on my face, a spray of spittle, and heard his teeth snapping, snapping at my right ear, as panic pressed upon him the tactics of a beast.  
  
  I broke the clinch, shoved him away with an elbow under the chin and with a knee that missed the crotch for which it was intended.  
  
  Sirens arose in the distance just as Stevie’s mom appeared at the open door, butcher knife glinting and ready: two cavalries, one in pajamas, the other in the blue-and-black uniform of the Pico Mundo Police Department.  
  
  Harlo couldn’t get past both me and the armed woman. He couldn’t reach Stevie, his longed-for shield, under the bed. If he threw open a window and climbed onto the front-porch roof, he would be fleeing directly into the arms of the arriving cops.  
  
  As the sirens swelled louder, nearer, Harlo backed into a corner where he stood gasping, shuddering. Wringing his hands, his face gray with anguish, he looked at the floor, the walls, the ceiling, not in the manner of a trapped man assessing the dimensions of his cage, but with bewilderment, as though he could not recall how he had come to be in this place and predicament.  
  
  Unlike the beasts of the wild, the many cruel varieties of human monsters, when at last cornered, seldom fight with greater ferocity. Instead, they reveal the cowardice at the core of their brutality.  
  
  Harlo’s wringing h  
ands twisted free of each other and covered his face. Through the chinks in that ten-fingered armor, I could see his eyes twitching with bright terror.  
  
  Back jammed into the corner, he slid down the junction of walls and sat on the floor with his legs splayed in front of him, hiding behind his hands as though they were a mask of invisibility that would allow him to escape the attention of justice.  
  
  The sirens reached a peak of volume half a block away, and then subsided from squeal to growl to waning groan in front of the house.  
  
  The day had dawned less than an hour ago, and I had spent every minute of the morning living up to my name.  
  
  THREE  
  
  THE DEAD DON’T TALK. I DON’T KNOW WHY.  
  
  Harlo Landerson had been taken away by the authorities. In his wallet they had found two Polaroids of Penny Kallisto. In the first, she was naked and alive. In the second, she was dead.  
  
  Stevie was downstairs, in his mother’s arms.  
  
  Wyatt Porter, chief of the Pico Mundo Police Department, had asked me to wait in Stevie’s room. I sat on the edge of the boy’s unmade bed.  
  
  I had not been alone long when Penny Kallisto walked through a wall and sat beside me. The ligature marks were gone from her neck. She looked as though she had never been strangled, had never died.  
  
  As before, she remained mute.  
  
  I tend to believe in the traditional architecture of life and the afterlife. This world is a journey of discovery and purification. The next world consists of two destinations: One is a palace for the spirit and an endless kingdom of wonder, while the other is cold and dark and unthinkable.  
  
  Call me simple-minded. Others do.  
  
  Stormy Llewellyn, a woman of unconventional views, believes instead that our passage through this world is intended to toughen us for the next life. She says that our honesty, integrity, courage, and determined resistance to evil are evaluated at the end of our days here, and that if we come up to muster, we will be conscripted into an army of souls engaged in some great mission in the next world. Those who fail the test simply cease to exist.

There’s a bit of window glare in the photo, but the sunrise made it worth capturing. Moments like these bring back strong memories of those peaceful early mornings at sea — standing on the bridge, coffee in hand, watching the sun rise over the open ocean. There's a unique kind of stillness out there that stays with you.

Working ashore now, but those sea sunrises will always hold a place in my heart. This view was the closest I’ve felt to that in a while.

1lylbyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lylbyg/contacting_my_childhood_psychologists_after_22/,Contacting my childhood psychologists after 22 years?,"In 2003 I was age 5 and diagnosed with ASD, Asperger’s variety with hyperlexia. I distinctly remember going to the doctor one week and then back again for testing. I think I remember the doctor testing my reflexes and I couldn’t believe the little cartoon hammer was real! Then I recall the psychologist in the second visit asking me a lot of questions, showing me how my mom had to watch us through one-way glass, having me put blocks in patterns, etc. I remember we walked to their break room and he gave me some water in a coffee mug. And then mom came back and we left. And then she sat in the parking lot crying. 

Fast forward, I’m 27 and just joined a major industrial company as a post-grad rotation program in Engineering. BS Mechatronic/Robotics Engineering and MS Industrial Engineering and Statistics. First time in my life I’ve woke up five days in a row happy to be alive and go to work. Hardest thing right now is unlearning my poverty mental approach to virtually everything. No kids no rent no problems. 

Anyway, I came across my HS exit psych evaluation recently. And it unlocked a lot of memories for me, bittersweet in the highest order. Felt like an airbag deploying in my face reading the name of the doctor that I first visited and then the psychologist that evaluated me on the second visit. 

The doctor sadly passed away about six months afterwards in June 2003. It seems the psychologist was from/returned to Dallas and is still working. 

I’m just struggling to understand/interpret everything I feel about this. Part of me just wants to say thank you for helping me get where I needed to be then. I’ve long forgotten their faces and that’s the root of my question. I found who I believe to be the son of the doctor on LinkedIn. I think I found an office address for the psychologist. I’d give anything to see a picture of these two men just to have them be part of my memory again. 

Is this weird? Because I feel like I’m only going to make it weird as fuck for the living son and be one of thousands to the psychologist if I try to contact them. But holy fuck I just don’t know how to explain how thankful I am that they helped me on my way to hell and back. First I’ve cried in some time so it’s very heavy right now.

1lylbi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lylbi2/theodore_boone_kid_lawyer_by_john_grisham/,Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer by John Grisham:," Chapter 1  
  
  Theodore Boone was an only child and for that reason usually had breakfast alone. His father, a busy lawyer, was in the habit of leaving early and meeting friends for coffee and gossip at the same downtown diner every morning at seven. Theo’s mother, herself a busy lawyer, had been trying to lose ten pounds for at least the past ten years, and because of this she’d convinced herself that breakfast should be nothing more than coffee with the newspaper. So he ate by himself at the kitchen table, cold cereal and orange juice, with an eye on the clock. The Boone home had clocks everywhere, clear evidence of organized people.  
  
  Actually, he wasn’t completely alone. Beside his chair, his dog ate, too. Judge was a thoroughly mixed mutt whose age and breeding would always be a mystery. Theo had rescued him from near death with a last-second appearance in Animal Court two years earlier, and Judge would always be grateful. He preferred Cheerios, same as Theo, and they ate together in silence every morning.  
  
  At 8:00 a.m., Theo rinsed their bowls in the sink, placed the milk and juice back in the fridge, walked to the den, and kissed his mother on the cheek. “Off to school,” he said.  
  
  “Do you have lunch money?” she asked, the same question five mornings a week.  
  
  “Always.”  
  
  “And your homework is complete?”  
  
  “It’s perfect, Mom.”  
  
  “And I’ll see you when?”  
  
  “I’ll stop by the office after school.” Theo stopped by the office every day after school, without fail, but Mrs. Boone always asked.  
  
  “Be careful,” she said. “And remember to smile.” The braces on his teeth had now been in place for over two years and Theo wanted desperately to get rid of them. In the meantime, though, his mother continually reminded him to smile and make the world a happier place.  
  
  “I’m smiling, Mom.”  
  
  “Love you, Teddy.”  
  
  “Love you back.”  
  
  Theo, still smiling in spite of being called “Teddy,” flung his backpack across his shoulders, scratched Judge on the head and said good-bye, then left through the kitchen door. He hopped on his bike and was soon speeding down Mallard Lane, a narrow leafy street in the oldest section of town. He waved at Mr. Nunnery, who was already on his porch and settled in for another long day of watching what little traffic found its way into their neighborhood, and he whisked by Mrs. Goodloe at the curb without speaking because she’d lost her hearing and most of her mind as well. He did smile at her, though, but she did not return the smile. Her teeth were somewhere in the house.  
  
  It was early spring and the air was crisp and cool. Theo pedaled quickly, the wind stinging his face. Homeroom was at eight forty and he had important matters before school. He cut through a side street, darted down an alley, dodged some traffic, and ran a stop sign. This was Theo’s turf, the route he traveled every day. After four blocks the houses gave way to offices and shops and stores.  
  
  The county courthouse was the largest building in downtown Strattenburg (the post office was second, the library third). It sat majestically on the north side of Main Street, halfway between a bridge over the river and a park filled with gazebos and birdbaths and monuments to those killed in wars. Theo loved the courthouse, with its air of authority, and people hustling importantly about, and somber notices and schedules tacked to the bulletin boards. Most of all, Theo loved the courtrooms themselves. There were small ones where more private matters were handled without juries, then there was the main courtroom on the second floor where lawyers battled like gladiators and judges ruled like kings.  
  
  At the age of thirteen, Theo was still undecided about his future. One day he dreamed of being a famous trial lawyer, one who handled the biggest cases and never lost before juries. The next day he dreamed of being a great judge, noted for his wisdom and fairness. He went back and forth, changing his mind daily.  
  
  The main lobby was already busy on this Monday morning, as if the lawyers and their clients wanted an early start to the week. There was a crowd waiting by the elevator, so Theo raced up two flights of stairs and down the east wing where Family Court was held. His mother was a noted divorce lawyer, one who always represented the wife, and Theo knew this area of the building well. Since divorce trials were decided by judges, juries were not used, and since most judges preferred not to have large groups of spectators observing such sensitive matters, the courtroom was small. By its door, several lawyers huddled importantly, obviously not agreeing on much. Theo searched the hallway, then turned a corner and saw his friend.  
  
  She was sitting on one of the old wooden benches, alone, small and frail and nervous. When she saw him she smiled and put a hand over her mouth. Theo hustled over and sat next to her, very closely, knees touching. With any other girl he would have placed himself at least two feet away and prevented any chance of contact.  
  
  But April Finnemore was not just any girl. They had started prekindergarten together at the age of four at a nearby church school, and they had been close friends since they could remember. It wasn’t a romance; they were too young for that. Theo did not know of a single thirteen-year-old boy in his class who admitted to having a girlfriend. Just the opposite. They wanted nothing to do with them. And the girls felt the same way. Theo had been warned that things would change, and dramatically, but that seemed unlikely.  
  
  April was just a friend, and one in a great deal of need at the moment. Her parents were divorcing, and Theo was extremely grateful his mother was not involved with the case.  
  
  The divorce was no surprise to anyone who knew the Finnemores. April’s father was an eccentric antiques dealer and the drummer for an old rock band that still played in nightclubs and toured for weeks at a time. Her mother raised goats and made goat cheese, which she peddled around town in a converted funeral hearse, painted bright yellow. An ancient spider monkey with gray whiskers rode shotgun and munched on the cheese, which had never sold very well. Mr. Boone had once described the family as “nontraditional,” which Theo took to mean downright weird. Both her parents had been arrested on drug charges, though neither had served time.  
  
  “Are you okay?” Theo asked.  
  
  “No,” she said. “I hate being here.”  
  
  She had an older brother named August and an older sister named March, and both fled the family. August left the day after he graduated from high school. March dropped out at the age of sixteen and left town, leaving April as the only child for her parents to torment. Theo knew all of this because April told him everything. She had to. She needed someone outside of her family to confide in, and Theo was her listener.  
  
  “I don’t want to live with either one of them,” she said. It was a terrible thing to say about one’s parents, but Theo understood completely. He despised her parents for the way they treated her. He despised them for the chaos of their lives, for their neglect of April, for their cruelty to her. Theo had a long list of grudges against Mr. and Mrs. Finnemore. He would run away before being forced to live there. He did not know of a single kid in town who’d ever set foot inside the Finnemore home.  
  
  The divorce trial was in its third day, and April would soon be called to the witness stand to testify. The judge would ask her the fateful question, “April, which parent do you want to live with?”  
  
  And she did not know the answer. She had discussed it for hours with Theo, and she still did not know what to say.  
  
  The great question in Theo’s mind was, “Why did either parent want custody of April?” Each had neglected her in so many ways. He had heard many stories, but he had never repeated a single one.  
  
  “What are you going to say?” he asked.  
  
  “I’m telling the judge that I want to live with my aunt Peg in Denver.”  
  
  “I thought she said no.”  
  
  “She did.”r />  
  “Then you can’t say that.”  
  
  “What can I say, Theo?”  
  
  “My mother would say that you should choose your mother. I know she’s not your first choice, but you don’t have a first choice.”  
  
  “But the judge can do whatever he wants, right?”  
  
  “Right. If you were fourteen, you could make a binding decision. At thirteen, the judge will only consider your wishes. According to my mother, this judge almost never awards custody to the father. Play it safe. Go with your mother.”  
  
  April wore jeans, hiking boots, and a navy sweater. She rarely dressed like a girl, but her gender was never in doubt. She wiped a tear from her cheek, but managed to keep her composure. “Thanks, Theo,” she said.  
  
  “I wish I could stay.”  
  
  “And I wish I could go to school.”  
  
  They both managed a forced laugh. “I’ll be thinking about you. Be strong.”  
  
  “Thanks, Theo.”  
  
  His favorite judge was the Honorable Henry Gantry, and he entered the great man’s outer office at twenty minutes after 8:00 a.m.  
  
  “Well, good morning, Theo,” Mrs. Hardy said. She was stirring something into her coffee and preparing to begin her work.  
  
  “Morning, Mrs. Hardy,” Theo said with a smile.  
  
  “And to what do we owe this honor?” she asked. She was not quite as old as Theo’s mother, he guessed, and she was very pretty. She was Theo’s favorite of all the secretaries in the courthouse. His favorite clerk was Jenny over in Family Court.  
  
  “I need to see Judge Gantry,” he replied. “Is he in?”  
  
  “Well, yes, but he’s very busy.”  
  
  “Please. It’ll just take a minute.”  
  
  She sipped her coffee, then asked, “Does this have anything to do with the big trial tomorrow?”  
  
  “Yes, ma’am, it does. I’d like for my Government class to watch the first day of the trial, but I gotta make sure there will be enough seats.”  
  
  “Oh, I don’t know about that, Theo,” Mrs. Hardy said, frowning and shaking her head. “We’re expecting an overflow crowd. Seating will be tight.”  
  
  “Can I talk to the judge?”  
  
  “How many are in your class?”  
  
  “Sixteen. I thought maybe we could sit in the balcony.”  
  
  She was still frowning as she picked up the phone and pushed a button. She waited for a second, then said, “Yes, Judge, Theodore Boone is here and would like to see you. I told him you are very busy.” She listened some more, then put down the phone. “Hurry,” she said, pointing to the judge’s door.  
  
  Seconds later, Theo stood before the biggest desk in town, a desk covered with all sorts of papers and files and thick binders, a desk that symbolized the enormous power held by Judge Henry Gantry, who, at that moment, was not smiling. In fact, Theo was certain the judge had not cracked a smile since he’d interrupted his work. Theo, though, was pressing hard with a prolonged flash of metal from ear to ear.  
  
  “State your case,” Judge Gantry said. Theo had heard him issue this command on many occasions. He’d seen lawyers, good lawyers, rise and stutter and search for words while Judge Gantry scowled down from the bench. He wasn’t scowling now, nor was he wearing his black robe, but he was still intimidating. As Theo cleared his throat, he saw an unmistakable twinkle in his friend’s eye.  
  
  “Yes, sir, well, my Government teacher is Mr. Mount, and Mr. Mount thinks we might get approval from the principal for an all-day field trip to watch the opening of the trial tomorrow.” Theo paused, took a deep breath, told himself again to speak clearly, slowly, forcefully, like all great trial lawyers. “But, we need guaranteed seats. I was thinking we could sit in the balcony.”  
  
  “Oh, you were?”  
  
  “Yes, sir.”  
  
  “How many?”  
  
  “Sixteen, plus Mr. Mount.”  
  
  The judge picked up a file, opened it, and began reading as if he’d suddenly forgotten about Theo standing at attention across the desk. Theo waited for an awkward fifteen seconds. Then the judge abruptly said, “Seventeen seats, front balcony, left side. I’ll tell the bailiff to seat you at ten minutes before nine, tomorrow. I expect perfect behavior.”  
  
  “No problem, sir.”  
  
  “I’ll have Mrs. Hardy e-mail a note to your principal.”  
  
  “Thanks, Judge.”  
  
  “You can go now, Theo. Sorry to be so busy.”  
  
  “No problem, sir.”  
  
  Theo was scurrying toward the door when the judge said, “Say, Theo. Do you think Mr. Duffy is guilty?”  
  
  Theo stopped, turned around and without hesitating responded, “He’s presumed innocent.”  
  
  “Got that. But what’s your opinion as to his guilt?”  
  
  “I think he did it.”  
  
  The judge nodded slightly but gave no indication of whether he agreed.  
  
  “What about you?” Theo asked.  
  
  Finally, a smile. “I’m a fair and impartial referee, Theo. I have no preconceived notions of guilt or innocence.”  
  
  “That’s what I thought you’d say.”  
  
  “See you tomorrow.” Theo cracked the door and hustled out.  
  
  Mrs. Hardy was on her feet, hands on hips, staring down two flustered lawyers who were demanding to see the judge. All three clammed up when Theo walked out of Judge Gantry’s office. He smiled at Mrs. Hardy as he walked hurriedly by. “Thanks,” he said as he opened the door and disappeared.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  The ride from the courthouse to the middle school would take fifteen minutes if properly done, if one obeyed the traffic laws and refrained from trespassing. And normally this is the way Theo would do things, except when he was running a bit late. He flew down Market Street the wrong way, jumped the curb just ahead of a car, and bolted through a parking lot, used every sidewalk available, then—his most serious offense—he ducked between two houses on Elm Street. Theo heard someone yelling from the porch behind him until he was safely into an alley that ran into the teachers’ parking lot behind his school. He checked his watch—nine minutes. Not bad.  
  
  He parked at the rack by the flagpole, secured his bike with a chain, then entered with a flood of kids who’d just stepped off a bus. The eight forty bell was ringing when he walked into his homeroom and said good morning to Mr. Mount, who not only taught him Government but was his adviser as well.  
  
  “Talked to Judge Gantry,” Theo said at the teacher’s desk, one considerably smaller than the one he’d just left in the courthouse. The room was buzzing with the usual early morning chaos. All sixteen boys were present and all appeared to be involved in some sort of gag, scuffle, joke, or shoving match.  
  
  “And?”  
  
  “Got the seats, first thing in the morning.”  
  
  “Excellent. Great job, Theo.”  
  
  Mr. Mount eventually restored order, called the roll, made his announcements, and ten minutes later sent the boys down the hall to their first period Spanish class with Madame Monique. There was some awkward flirting between the rooms as the boys mixed with the girls. During classes, they were “gender-separated,” according to a new policy adopted by the smart people in charge of educating all the children in town. The genders were free to mingle at all other times.  
  
  Madame Monique was a tall, dark lady from Cameroon, in West Africa. She had moved to Strattenburg three years earlier when her husband, also from Cameroon, took a job at the local college where he taught languages. She was not the typical teacher at the middle school, far from it. As a child in Africa, she had grown up speaking Beti, her tribal dialect, as well as French and English, the official languages of Cameroon. Her father was a doctor, and thus could afford to send her to school in Switzerland, where she picked up German and Italian. Her Spanish had been perfected when she went to college in Madrid. She was currently working on Russian with plans to move on to Mandarin Chinese. Her classroom was filled with large, colorful maps of the world, and her students believed she’d been everywhere, seen everything, and could speak any language. It’s a big world, she told them many times, and most people in other  
countries speak more than one language. While the students concentrated on Spanish, they were also encouraged to explore others.  
  
  Theo’s mother had been studying Spanish for twenty years, and as a preschooler he had learned from her many of the basic words and phrases. Some of her clients were from Central America, and when Theo saw them at the office he was ready to practice. They always thought it was cute.  
  
  Madame Monique had told him that he had an ear for languages, and this had inspired him to study harder. She was often asked by her curious students to “say something in German.” Or, “Speak some Italian.” She would, but first the student making the request had to stand and say a few words in that language. Bonus points were given, and this created enthusiasm. Most of the boys in Theo’s class knew a few dozen words in several languages. Aaron, who had a Spanish mother and a German father, was by far the most talented linguist. But Theo was determined to catch him. After Government, Spanish was his favorite class, and Madame Monique ran a close second to Mr. Mount as his favorite teacher.  
  
  Today, though, he had trouble concentrating. They were studying Spanish verbs, a tedious chore on a good day, and Theo’s mind was elsewhere. He worried about April and her awful day on the witness stand. He couldn’t imagine the horror of being forced to choose one parent over another. And when he managed to set April aside, he was consumed with the murder trial and couldn’t wait until tomorrow, to watch the opening statements by the lawyers.  
  
  Most of his classmates dreamed of getting tickets to the big game or concert. Theo Boone lived for the big trials.  
  
  Second period was Geometry with Miss Garman. It was followed by a short break outdoors, then the class returned to homeroom, to Mr. Mount and the best hour of the day, at least in Theo’s opinion. Mr. Mount was in his midthirties, and had once worked as a lawyer at a gigantic firm in a skyscraper in Chicago. His brother was a lawyer. His father and grandfather had been lawyers and judges. Mr. Mount, though, had grown weary of the long hours and high pressure, and, well, he’d quit. He’d walked away from the big money and found something he found far more rewarding. He loved teaching, and though he still thought of himself as a lawyer, he considered the classroom far more important than the courtroom.  
  
  Because he knew the law so well, his Government class spent most of its time discussing cases, old ones and current ones and even fictitious ones on television.  
  
  “All right, men,” he began when they were seated and still. He always addressed them as “men” and for thirteen-year-olds there was no greater compliment. “Tomorrow I want you here at eight fifteen. We’ll take a bus to the courthouse and we’ll be in our seats in plenty of time. It’s a field trip, approved by the principal, so you will be excused from all other classes. Bring lunch money and we’ll eat at Pappy’s Deli. Any questions?”  
  
  The men were hanging on every word, excitement all over their faces.  
  
  “What about backpacks?” someone asked.  
  
  “No,” Mr. Mount answered. “You can’t take anything into the courtroom. Security will be tight. It is, after all, the first murder trial here in a long time. Any more questions?”  
  
  “What should we wear?”  
  
  Slowly, all eyes turned to Theo, including those of Mr. Mount. It was well known that Theo spent more time in the courthouse than most lawyers.  
  
  “Coat and tie, Theo?” Mr. Mount asked.  
  
  “No, not at all. What we’re wearing now is fine.”  
  
  “Great. Any more questions? Good. Now, I’ve asked Theo if he would sort of set the stage for tomorrow. Lay out the courtroom, give us the players, tell us what we’re in for. Theo.”  
  
  Theo’s laptop was already wired to the overhead projector. He walked to the front of the class, pressed a key, and a large diagram appeared on the digital wide-screen whiteboard. “This is the main courtroom,” Theo said, in his best lawyer’s voice. He held a laser pointer with a red light and sort of waved it around the diagram. “At the top, in the center here, is the bench. That’s where the judge sits and controls the trial. Not sure why it’s called a bench. It’s more like a throne. But, anyway, we’ll stick with bench. The judge is Henry Gantry.” He punched a key, and a large formal photo of Judge Gantry appeared. Black robe, somber face. Theo shrank it, then dragged it up to the bench. With the judge in place, he continued, “Judge Gantry has been a judge for about twenty years and handles only criminal cases. He runs a tight courtroom and is well liked by most of the lawyers.” The laser pointer moved to the middle of the courtroom. “This is the defense table, where Mr. Duffy, the man accused of murder, will be seated.” Theo punched a key and a black-and-white photo, one taken from a newspaper, appeared. “This is Mr. Duffy. Age forty-nine, used to be married to Mrs. Duffy, who is now deceased, and as we all know, Mr. Duffy is accused of murdering her.” He shrank the photo and moved it to the defense table. “His lawyer is Clifford Nance, probably the top criminal defense lawyer in this part of the state.” Nance appeared in color, wearing a dark suit and a shifty smile. He had long, curly gray hair. His photo was reduced and placed next to his client’s. “Next to the defense table is the prosecution’s table. The lead prosecutor is Jack Hogan, who’s also known as the district attorney, or DA.” Hogan’s photo appeared for a few seconds before it was reduced and placed at the table next to the defense.  
  
  “Where’d you find these photos?” someone asked.  
  
  “Each year the bar association publishes a directory of all the lawyers and judges,” Theo answered.

Are you included?” This brought a few light laughs.  
  
  “No. Now, there will be other lawyers and paralegals at both tables, prosecution and defense. This area is usually crowded. Over here, next to the defense, is the jury box. It has fourteen chairs—twelve for the jurors and two for the alternates. Most states still use twelve-man juries, though different sizes are not unusual. Regardless of the number, the verdict has to be unanimous, at least in criminal cases. They pick alternates in case one of the twelve gets sick or excused or something. The jury was selected last week, so we won’t have to watch that. It’s pretty boring.” The laser pointer moved to a spot in front of the bench. Theo continued, “The court reporter sits here. She’ll have a machine that is called a stenograph. Sorta looks like a typewriter, but much different. Her job is to record every word that’s said during the trial. That might sound impossible, but she makes it look easy. Later, she’ll prepare what’s known as a transcript so that the lawyers and the judge will have a record of everything. Some transcripts have thousands of pages.” The laser pointer moved again. “Here, close to the court reporter and just down from the judge, is the witness chair. Each witness walks up here, is sworn to tell the truth, then takes a seat.”  
  
  “Where do we sit?”  
  
  The laser pointer moved to the middle of the diagram. “This is called the bar. Again, don’t ask why. The bar is a wooden railing that separates the spectators from the trial area. There are ten rows of seats with an aisle down the middle. This is usually more than enough for the crowd, but this trial will be different.” The laser pointer moved to the rear of the courtroom. “Up here, above the last few rows, is the balcony where there are three long benches. We’re in the balcony, but don’t worry. We’ll be able to see and hear everything.”  
  
  “Any questions?” Mr. Mount asked.  
  
  The boys gawked at the diagram. “Who goes first?” someone asked.  
  
  Theo began pacing. “Well, the State has the burden of proving guilt, so it must present its case first. First thing tomorrow morning, the prosecutor will walk to the jury box and address the jurors. This is called the opening statement. He’ll lay out his case. Then the defense lawyer will do the same. After that, the State will start calling witnesses. As you know, Mr. Duffy is presumed to be innocent, so the State must prove him guilty, and it must do so beyond a reasonable doubt. He claims he’s innocent, which actually in real life doesn’t happen very often. About eighty percent of those indicted for murder eventually plead guilty, because they are in fact guilty. The other twenty percent go to trial, and ninety percent of those are found guilty. So, it’s rare for a murder defendant to be found not guilty.”  
  
  “My dad thinks he’s guilty,” Brian said.  
  
  “A lot of people do,” Theo said.  
  
  “How many trials have you watched, Theo?”  
  
  “I don’t know. Dozens.”  
  
  Since none of the other fifteen had ever seen the inside of a courtroom, this was almost beyond belief. Theo continued: “For those of you who watch a lot of television, don’t expect fireworks. A real trial is very different, and not nearly as exciting. There are no surprise witnesses, no dramatic confessions, no fistfights between the lawyers. And, in this trial, there are no eyewitnesses to the murder. This means that all of the evidence from the State will be circumstantial. You’ll hear this word a lot, especially from Mr. Clifford Nance, the defense lawyer. He’ll make a big deal out of the fact that the State has no direct proof, that everything is circumstantial.”  
  
  “I’m not sure what that means,” someone said.  
  
  “It means that the evidence is indirect, not direct. For example, did you ride your bike to school?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “And did you chain it to the rack by the flagpole?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “So, when you leave school this afternoon, and you go to the rack, and your bike is gone, and the chain has been cut, then you have indirect evidence that someone stole your bike. No one saw the thief, so there’s no direct evidence. And let’s say that tomorrow the police find your bike in a pawnshop on Raleigh Street, a place known to deal in stolen bikes. The owner gives the police a name, they investigate and find some dude with a history of stealing bikes. You can then make a strong case, through indirect evidence, that this guy is your thief. No direct evidence, but circumstantial.”  
  
  Even Mr. Mount was nodding along. He was the faculty adviser for the Eighth-Grade Debate Team, and, not surprisingly, Theodore Boone was his star. He’d never had a student as quick on his feet.  
  
  “Thank you, Theo,” Mr. Mount said. “And thank you for getting us the seats in the morning.”  
  
  “Nothing to it,” Theo said, and proudly took his seat.  
  
  It was a bright class in a strong public school. Justin was by far the best athlete, though he couldn’t swim as fast as Brian. Ricardo beat them all at golf and tennis. Edward played the cello, Woody the electric guitar, Darren the drums, Jarvis the trumpet. Joey had the highest IQ and made perfect grades. Chase was the mad scientist who was always a threat to blow up the lab. Aaron spoke Spanish, from his mother’s side, German from his father’s, and English, of course. Brandon had an early morning paper route, traded stocks online, and planned to be the first millionaire in the group.  
  
  Naturally, there were two hopeless nerds and at least one potential felon.  
  
  The class even had its own lawyer, a first for Mr. Mount.  
  
  Chapter 3  
  
  The law firm of Boone & Boone had its offices in an old converted house on Park Street, three blocks off of Main and a ten-minute walk to the courthouse. There were lots of lawyers in the neighborhood, and all the houses on Park had become the offices of attorneys, architects, accountants, engineers, and so on.  
  
  The firm had two lawyers, Mr. Boone and Mrs. Boone, and they were equal partners in every sense of the word. Mr. Boone, Theo’s father, was in his early fifties, but seemed to be much older, at least in Theo’s well-kept opinion. His first name was Woods, which, to Theo, seemed more suited for a surname. Tiger Woods, the golfer. James Woods, the actor. Theo was still searching for another human being with the first name of Woods, though he didn’t spend a lot of time worrying about this slight nuisance. He tried not to worry about things out of his control.  
  
  Woods Boone. Sometimes, Theo pronounced the name quickly and it sounded like woodspoon. He’d checked and woodspoon wasn’t really a word, but he thought it should be. A spoon made from wood is known as a wooden spoon, not a woodspoon. But who uses a wooden spoon? Why worry about such trivial matters? Anyway, like one of those annoying habits you can’t break, Theo thought of the word woodspoon every time he approached the door to his father’s office and saw his name stenciled in black lettering.  
  
  His office was on the second floor, up some rickety steps covered with stained and threadbare carpet. Mr. Boone was on the second floor, alone, because the ladies below had sent him there for two reasons. First, he was a slob and his office was a wreck, though Theo loved it. Second, and much more offensive, Mr. Boone smoked a pipe, and preferred to do so with the windows closed and the ceiling fan off so that the air was thick with the rich aroma of whatever flavored tobacco he happened to favor that day. The smoke didn’t bother Theo, either, though he did worry about his father’s health. Mr. Boone was not exactly concerned with fitness. He exercised little and was a bit on the heavy side. He worked hard but left his problems at the office, unlike his law partner, Theo’s mom.  
  
  Mr. Boone was a real estate lawyer, and in Theo’s opinion this was the most boring of all areas of the law. His father never went to court, never argued before a judge, never addressed a jury, never, it seemed, left the office. In fact, he often referred to himself as an “office lawyer,” and appeared pleased with such a title. Theo certainly admired his father, but he had no plans to spend his career locked away in some office. No, sir. Theo was headed for the courtroom.  
  
  Because Mr. Boone was alone on the second floor, his office was huge. Long, saggy bookshelves lin  
ed two of the walls and on the other two were ever-expanding collections of framed photographs depicting Woods doing all sorts of important things—shaking hands with politicians, posing with lawyers at bar meetings, and so on. Theo had seen the inside of several other lawyers’ offices in town—he was quite nosy and always looking for an open door—and he’d already learned that lawyers loved to cover their walls with such photos, along with diplomas and awards and certificates of membership in this club or that. The Ego Wall, his mother called it, sneering, because her walls were practically bare, with only a few pieces of some baffling modern art hanging about.  
  
  Theo knocked on the door as he pushed it open. He was expected to say hello to both parents each afternoon after school, unless he was busy elsewhere. His father sat alone behind an ancient desk that was covered with piles of paper. His father was always alone because his clients seldom stopped by. They called or sent stuff by mail or fax or e-mail, but they didn’t need to visit Boone & Boone to get advice.  
  
  “Hello,” Theo said as he fell into a chair.  
  
  “A good day at school?” his father asked, the same question every day.  
  
  “Pretty good. The principal approved our field trip to go to court tomorrow. I saw Judge Gantry this morning and he promised seats in the balcony.”  
  
  “That was nice. You’re lucky. Half the town will be there.”  
  
  “Are you going?”  
  
  “Me? No,” his father said, waving at the piles of paper as if they required immediate attention. Theo had overheard a conversation between his parents in which they had vowed not to stop by the courtroom during the murder trial. They were busy lawyers themselves, and, well, it just didn’t seem right to waste time watching someone else’s trial. But Theo knew that they, like everyone else in town, wanted to be there.  
  
  His father, and his mother to a lesser extent, used the excuse of too much legal work when they wanted to avoid doing something.  
  
  “How long will the trial last?” Theo asked.  
  
  “The word on the street is that it might take a week.”  
  
  “I’d sure like to watch all of it.”  
  
  “Don’t even think about it, Theo. I’ve already talked to Judge Gantry. If he sees you in the courtroom when you’re supposed to be in school, he will stop the trial, order a bailiff to take you into custody, and haul you away. I will not bail you out of jail. You’ll sit there for days with common drunks and gang members.”  
  
  With that, Mr. Boone picked up a pipe, fired a small torch into its bowl, and began blowing smoke. They stared at each other. Theo wasn’t sure if his father was joking, but his face certainly looked serious. He and Judge Gantry were old friends.  
  
  “Are you kidding?” Theo finally asked.  
  
  “Partially. I’m sure I’d fetch you from jail, but I have talked to Judge Gantry.”  
  
  Theo was already thinking of ways to watch the trial without being seen by Judge Gantry. Skipping school would be the easy part.  
  
  “Now shove off,” Mr. Boone said. “Let’s get the homework done.”  
  
  “See you later.”  
  
  Downstairs, the front door was guarded by a woman who was almost as old as the office itself. Her first name was Elsa. Her last name was Miller, though this was off-limits to Theo and everyone else. Regardless of her age, and no one knew it for certain, she insisted on being called Elsa. Even by a thirteen-year-old. Elsa had worked for the Boones since long before Theo was born. She was the receptionist, secretary, office manager, and paralegal when needed. She ran the firm, and occasionally she was forced to referee the little spats and disagreements between lawyer Boone upstairs and lawyer Boone downstairs.  
  
  Elsa was a very important person in the lives of all three Boones. Theo considered her a friend and confidante. “Hello, Elsa,” he said as he stopped at her desk and prepared to give her a hug.  
  
  She jumped from her chair, bubbly as always, and squeezed him tightly. Then she looked at his chest and said, “Didn’t you wear that shirt Friday?”  
  
  “I did not.” And he did not.  
  
  “I think you did.”  
  
  “Sorry, Elsa.” She often commented on his attire, and, for a thirteen-year-old boy this was tiresome. However, it kept Theo on his toes. Someone was always watching and taking notes, and he often thought of Elsa when he hurriedly got dressed each morning. Another irritating habit he couldn’t shake.  
  
  Her own wardrobe was legendary. She was short and very petite—“could wear anything,” his mother had said many times—and preferred tight clothing in bold colors. Today, she was wearing black leather pants with some sort of funky green sweater that reminded Theo of asparagus. Her short gray hair was shiny and spiked. Her eyeglasses, as always, matched the color of her outfit—green today. Elsa was anything but dull. She might be pushing seventy, but she was not aging quietly.  
  
  “Is my mother in?” Theo asked.  
  
  “Yes, and the door is open.” She was back in her chair. Theo was walking away.  
  
  “Thank you.”  
  
  “One of your friends called.”  
  
  “Who?”  
  
  “Said his name was Sandy and he might be stopping by.”  
  
  “Thanks.”  
  
  Theo walked along the hallway. He stopped at one door and said hello to Dorothy, the real estate secretary, a nice lady who was as boring as her boss upstairs. He stopped at another door and said hello to Vince, their longtime paralegal who worked on Mrs. Boone’s cases.  
  
  Marcella Boone was on the phone when Theo walked in and took a seat. Her desk, glass and chrome, was neatly organized with most of the surface visible, a sharp contrast to her husband’s. Her current files were in a tidy rack behind her. Everything was in place, except her shoes, which were not on her feet but parked nearby. The shoes were heels, which to Theo meant that she had been in court during the day. She was in a courtroom outfit—a burgundy skirt and jacket. His mother was always pretty and put together, but she made an extra effort on those days when she went to court.  
  
  “The men can look like slobs,” she said many times. “But the women are expected to look nice. What’s fair about that?”  
  
  Elsa always agreed that it wasn’t fair.  
  
  The truth was that Mrs. Boone enjoyed spending money on clothes and looking nice. Mr. Boone cared nothing for fashion and even less for neatness. He was only three years older in age, but at least a decade in spirit.  
  
  At the moment, she was talking to a judge, one who did not agree with her. When she finally hung up, her attitude changed quickly. With a smile she said, “Hello, my dear. How was your day?”  
  
  “Great, Mom. And yours?”  
  
  “The usual. Any excitement at school?”  
  
  “Just a field trip tomorrow, to watch the trial. Are you going?”  
  
  She was already shaking her head no. “I have a hearing at ten in front of Judge Sanford. I’m too busy to sit through a trial, Theo.”  
  
  “Dad says he’s already talked to Judge Gantry, and they’ve cooked up a plan to keep me away from the trial. Do you believe it?”  
  
  “I certainly hope so. School is a priority.”  
  
  “School is boring, Mom. I enjoy two classes. Everything else is a waste of time.”  
  
  “I wouldn’t say your education is a waste.”  
  
  “I can learn more in the courtroom.”  
  
  “Perhaps, but you’ll have a chance to spend plenty of time there one day. For now, though, we’re concentrating on the eighth grade. Okay?”  
  
  “I’m thinking about taking a few law courses online. There’s a cool website that offers some great stuff.”  
  
  “Theodore, honey, you’re not ready for law school. We’ve had this conversation. Let’s enjoy the eighth grade, then off to high school, then beyond. You’re just a kid, okay? Enjoy being a kid.”  
  
  He sort of shrugged, said nothing.  
  
  “Now, let’s get the homework done.”  
  
  Her phone buzzed and Elsa was sending back another important call. “Now, excuse me, Teddy, and please smile,” Mrs. Boone said. Theo eased out of the office. He carried his backpack through th  
e copy room, always a mess, and worked his way through two storage rooms packed with large boxes of old files.  
  
  Theo was certain that he was the only eighth grader in Strattenburg with his own law office. It was a small boxlike closet that someone had added to the main house decades earlier, and before Theo took it over the firm had used it to store old law books that were out of date. His desk was a card table that was not quite as neat as his mother’s but much more organized than his father’s. His chair was a ragged swivel unit he’d saved from the junk pile when his parents had refurbished the library up front near Elsa’s station.  
  
  Sitting in his chair was his dog. Judge spent each day at the office, sleeping or roaming quietly around, trying to avoid the humans because they were always so busy. He was routinely kicked out of meetings. Late in the day, he eased back to Theo’s office, climbed into his chair, and waited.  
  
  “Hello, Judge,” Theo said as he rubbed his head. “Have you had a busy day?”

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Humorous Recap: Phillies vs. Padres – A Tale of Two Bullpens (and a Lot of Small Ball)**

**Key Statistics: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
The Philadelphia Phillies (54-40) enter this matchup as the statistical darling of the MLB, boasting a 4.6 runs per game offense (13th in MLB) and a 3.64 ERA. Their lineup, led by the ""Three Musketeers"" (Schwarber, Machado, and Turner), is a menace to opposing pitchers—though they’ve dropped three of four games, clearly due to a lack of dramatics, not skill.

The San Diego Padres (51-43) are the yin to the Phils’ yang: a team with a solid 3.8 ERA (per context) but a HR defense that’s softer than a PETCO Park pretzel. Their reliance on small ball is both admirable and baffling—Fernando Tatis Jr. is a wizard with the bat, but even he can’t will a 1.1-hit game into a win. Nick Pivetta, starting for SD, is the definition of “mystery meat” in a pitcher’s uniform.

**Injuries/Updates: No Major Drama (Yet)**  
Neither team has reported any catastrophic injuries—though the Padres’ HR struggles might qualify as a “slow-moving disaster.” The Phillies’ recent skid? Blame it on Zack Wheeler’s vacation (he starts Wednesday, presumably). For now, it’s clean bill of health for both squads.

**Odds Breakdown: Math, Not Magic**

* **Phillies (-128):** Implied probability = 56.14%.
* **Padres (+128):** Implied probability = 43.86%.

**EV Calculations: The Underdog’s Burden**

* **Phillies (Favorite):** Adjusted probability = (56.14% + 59%)/2 = **57.57%** (EV +1.43%).
* **Padres (Underdog):** Adjusted probability = (43.86% + 41%)/2 = **42.43%** (EV -1.43%).

**Why the Phillies Are the Smart Bet (and Why the Padres Should Bring a Towel)**  
The math is clear: The Phillies’ adjusted probability (57.57%) > their implied odds (56.14%), giving them a sliver of EV. Meanwhile, the Padres’ adjusted win rate (42.43%) languishes below their implied 43.86%.

But let’s get real: The Padres are the MLB’s answer to a “clutch” team—winning with singles, walks, and the occasional sac fly. Their HR struggles? A badge of honor in an era of launch angles and meatballs. The Phillies, meanwhile, are the overachieving Wall Street bro of baseball: high-octane offense, stable pitching, and a “just trust the process” attitude.

**Final Verdict: Roll the Dice on the Phillies**  
Take the Phillies (-128) like you’re investing in a S&P 500 ETF—safe, sane, and slightly boring. The Padres? They’re the crypto of MLB: high-risk, high-reward, and best left to people who think “volatility” is a strategy.

*And remember, folks: In baseball, even a 41% underdog rate can’t save a team that can’t hit a home run. Bring a coffee mug to PETCO Park—it’s a long, low-scoring night ahead.* 🎩⚾

1lyl80s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1lyl80s/is_it_ever_worth_making_your_own_sweetened/,Is it ever worth making your own sweetened condensed milk?,"I mainly use sweetened condensed milk for Vietnamese coffee, and some occasional desserts like non-churn ice cream and Almond Joys. I like to fine tune things whenever I get a chance, and thought it would be nice to be able to control the sweetener, or maybe just give an overall boost to the quality of the sweetened condensed milk if I did it myself.

So far I haven't noticed a difference at all. Just seemed like a huge waste of time and ingredients. I've tried domino sugar as well as cane and palm sugars. I even ran a few batches with raw milk. There's this distinct taste I get from those desserts that are primarily sweetened with sweetened condensed milk, and I always assumed it was some kind of signature from using it from a can. I toured everything I use it for, excited to see the difference, but saw literally none at all.

Just wondering if any of you have any thoughts one way or another on making it yourself. Does anybody know what I'm referring to with that distinct taste? Do any of you swear by doing (or not doing) it yourself as opposed to simply going with the canned stuff?",4,1752385315.0,Cooking,3,1.0,False

Now I live with my mother, but she already has plans to go with her new partner and my stepsister to my hometown or I can't go with them because I'm studying in Ureña, near the border with Colombia. I'm also going to stay alone. The truth is, I have grandparents here, but I honestly don't think they'll be willing to help me, not even with food or a place to sleep.

I've tried many things: selling clothes, coffee, desserts, but nothing has worked. This is a town where poverty is on every corner, people just don't buy. And when I try to sell something on the street or in Cúcuta, they look at me badly, reject me with a hypocritical smile or tell me “another day” in a condescending tone. That kills me inside.

I'm tired of this constant rejection, of this life in which every day I have to think about whether I'm going to be able to eat or not. I don't want to sound like a victim, but I don't know what to do anymore. I just want a decent life. I just want to study, have a decent job, live without this stress, without feeling that I am a burden or that I am worthless.

I have tried virtual jobs, entrepreneurship... nothing has worked. I feel trapped and very alone. The truth is, I hate my family. Nobody has really been there. I feel like I have never been truly loved, and it hurts me deeply.

All I ask is an escape. A guide. Real advice. Something that works. I don't want to continue like this. I need help.

I realize that You were simply a Visitor to my world.

I entertained the idea of You

I indulged in You

I dined upon your body as often as I could

yet I have no core memories or imprinted gifts with which to

remember You

only misty half-dreams of sweaty skin on skin

mumbled words of praise and

awkward silences.

not enough planning

visits which felt not frequent enough

I catch your eyes in the rearview mirror

years from now where you wake

with another’s warmth beside you.

you will still reach under the sheets and

your mind will inevitably turn to Me.

you might confuse for nostalgia

Perhaps that was not nice.

Perhaps it was.

But now it is over.

you finish to the memory of my scent

longing and desire etched into every neuron

as You breathe Me in.

 

Those same mornings will be quiet for me

Perhaps I have another Visitor warming my bed now

Perhaps I do not.

I will wake

to the sunlight kissing my skin instead

the scent of coffee leading me to the kitchen

the toast is still warm

the butter melts in my mouth

1lykz7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1lykz7e/best_vpns_for_frankfurt/,Best VPNs for Frankfurt,"Frankfurt am Main isn't just Germany's financial powerhouse—it's also a major digital hub where privacy concerns run deep. Whether you're a local resident worried about data retention laws, an expat missing content from home, or a business traveler needing secure connections, finding the right VPN for Frankfurt can feel overwhelming.

Here's the thing: not all VPNs are created equal, especially when it comes to German servers and local regulations. After testing dozens of providers and analyzing real user experiences, I've narrowed down the best options that actually work in Frankfurt's unique digital landscape.

**Bottom line upfront**: NordVPN takes the crown with 240+ servers in Frankfurt and Berlin, followed closely by Surfshark for budget-conscious users and CyberGhost for those wanting the most server options. But let's dive deeper into why Frankfurt users need VPNs and which ones deliver the goods.

# Why Frankfurt Residents Need a VPN More Than Ever

Living in Frankfurt comes with some serious digital privacy challenges that many folks don't realize until it's too late. Germany requires ISPs to store your metadata for 10 weeks, which can be handed over to law enforcement authorities upon request. That's your browsing history, connection times, and online activities sitting in a database.

But wait, there's more. Germany is part of the 14-Eyes surveillance alliance, an agreement between countries allowing the sharing of citizens' data. Your online activities could potentially be shared with intelligence agencies across multiple nations.

Then there's the copyright situation. German law firms actively monitor torrents for German IP addresses, and you can be fined between €500-€1,500 if caught downloading protected content. I know someone who got slapped with a €800 fine just for accidentally downloading a single movie. Ouch.

On top of all this, Frankfurt's bustling café scene and public WiFi networks create perfect opportunities for hackers. Whether you're checking emails at Kleinmarkthalle or working from a coworking space in Sachsenhausen, your data is vulnerable without proper protection.

For expats and frequent travelers, geo-blocking adds another layer of frustration. Try accessing your Netflix library from back home or catching up on local news from your home country—you'll hit a wall faster than you can say ""Apfelwein.""

# The 5 Best VPNs for Frankfurt in 2025

# 1. NordVPN - The Frankfurt Champion

**Best for: Overall performance and security**

NordVPN dominates Frankfurt's VPN landscape with over 240 servers split between Frankfurt and Berlin, delivering consistently fast speeds that often exceed 500 Mbps. During my testing, I regularly pulled down 892 Mbps on their Frankfurt servers—more than enough for 4K streaming or large file downloads.

What sets NordVPN apart is its rock-solid security foundation. They use military-grade AES-256 encryption combined with their proprietary NordLynx protocol (based on WireGuard) for blazing-fast speeds. The Threat Protection feature blocks ads, trackers, and malware automatically—a godsend when navigating Frankfurt's busy digital landscape.

**Frankfurt-specific perks:**

* Lightning-fast connections to German streaming services (ARD, ZDF, ProSieben)
* Double VPN servers for extra paranoid privacy
* Panama-based jurisdiction means they can never be forced to turn over data to German authorities
* 30-day money-back guarantee

**Pricing:** Starting at €3.99/month on annual plans **Bottom line:** Worth the premium for serious privacy needs

# 2. Surfshark - The Budget Beast

**Best for: Families and unlimited devices**

Don't let the lower price fool you—Surfshark consistently clocks over 950 Mbps in speed tests and offers unlimited simultaneous connections. Perfect for Frankfurt families or digital nomads with multiple devices.

Surfshark maintains servers in both Frankfurt and Berlin with WireGuard support for optimal speeds. Their Camouflage Mode is particularly useful for Frankfurt users who want to hide VPN usage from overly curious ISPs.

**What Frankfurt users love:**

* Auto-connect feature that kicks in whenever you join WiFi networks
* CleanWeb blocks those annoying German cookie consent popups
* MultiHop routes traffic through two servers for extra security
* Works seamlessly with German Netflix and international streaming

**Pricing:** €2.21/month on 2-year plans (€59.76 total) **Bottom line:** Unbeatable value without sacrificing performance

# 3. CyberGhost - The Frankfurt Specialist

**Best for: German content and streaming**

CyberGhost operates an impressive 844+ servers specifically in Frankfurt—more than any other provider. If you're serious about German content or need guaranteed Frankfurt IP addresses, this is your pick.

What's really cool is their streaming-optimized servers. They have dedicated servers for German platforms like ZDF, ARD, Zattoo, and DAZN that are checked daily to ensure they always work. No more buffering during Bundesliga matches!

**Frankfurt advantages:**

* Over 1,300 servers across Berlin, Düsseldorf, and Frankfurt
* 45-day money-back guarantee (longest in the industry)
* WireGuard protocol delivers unlimited bandwidth without throttling
* Perfect for accessing German banking from abroad

**Pricing:** Starting at €2.19/month on 2-year plans **Bottom line:** Ideal for heavy German content consumption

# 4. ExpressVPN - The Speed Demon

**Best for: Business users and consistent performance**

ExpressVPN runs servers in Frankfurt and Nuremberg with their proprietary Lightway protocol delivering some of the most consistent speeds available. While pricier, it's the go-to choice for Frankfurt business users who can't afford connection drops.

ExpressVPN has been audited multiple times by third parties, confirming both its privacy protections and server security. For Frankfurt's finance professionals handling sensitive data, this peace of mind is invaluable.

**Business-friendly features:**

* TrustedServer technology (RAM-only servers)
* Averaged 92 Mbps during Frankfurt testing with zero buffering
* Split tunneling for accessing local German services
* 24/7 live chat support

**Pricing:** €4.99/month with 61% discount on annual plans **Bottom line:** Premium option for those who need guaranteed reliability

# 5. Private Internet Access - The Privacy Purist

**Best for: Maximum anonymity and torrenting**

PIA offers unlimited simultaneous connections and can be configured directly on your router to protect every device in your Frankfurt home or office. Their no-logs policy has been tested in court multiple times—they literally have nothing to hand over to authorities.

PIA supports P2P traffic on servers in 91 countries and consistently provides very fast download speeds, making it perfect for Frankfurt users who need, shall we say, ""research materials"" from academic torrents.

**Privacy highlights:**

* Court-proven zero-logs policy
* Open-source apps for transparency
* 30-day money-back guarantee with money returned within a week
* MACE feature blocks ads and malware

**Pricing:** Starting at €2.19/month **Bottom line:** Best choice for serious privacy advocates

# What Makes a Great Frankfurt VPN?

When shopping for a VPN in Frankfurt, you can't just pick the first shiny option you see. Here's what actually matters:

**Server presence in Germany**: VPN servers in busy cities like Frankfurt can get overcrowded, causing buffering and lag. You want a provider with multiple Frankfurt servers to ensure consistent performance.

**Speed testing transparency**: The best providers test their servers every few hours and publish real-world speed data. Avoid services that only show theoretical speeds.

**Protocol support**: WireGuard is king for speed, but having OpenVPN as backup ensures compatibility with all devices and networks.

**Streaming capabilities**: If you want to access German TV abroad or international content from Frankfurt, make sure your VPN specifically mentions compatibility with your target services.

**Money-back guarantees**: CyberGhost offers 45 days while most others provide 30 days. Use this time to test real-world performance from your actual Frankfurt location.

# Legal VPN Use in Frankfurt: What You Need to Know

Good news first: VPNs are completely legal in Germany, and no legislation has ever been passed against VPN usage. You're free to protect your privacy without legal worries.

However, what you do with your VPN still matters. Streaming content that violates copyright rules remains illegal, even with a VPN. Stick to legitimate services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube—you'll stay legal and avoid those nasty copyright fines.

Using Popcorn Time or similar torrenting applications in Germany carries the same risks as regular torrenting. Your VPN provider can't protect you from legal consequences if you're breaking the law.

# Making Your Choice: Which Frankfurt VPN Is Right for You?

Here's my honest take after months of testing from various Frankfurt locations:

**Choose NordVPN** if you want the best overall package and don't mind paying a bit more. Their Frankfurt servers are consistently fast, and the security features are top-notch.

**Go with Surfshark** if budget is your main concern but you still want premium features. The unlimited device policy makes it perfect for families or anyone with multiple gadgets.

**Pick CyberGhost** if you're primarily interested in German content or need rock-solid access to local streaming services. Those 844 Frankfurt servers aren't just for show.

**Select ExpressVPN** if you're a business user who needs guaranteed uptime and consistent performance for mission-critical work.

**Choose PIA** if privacy is your absolute top priority and you want a provider with a proven track record of protecting user data.

The beauty of modern VPNs is that you can try before you buy. All major providers offer money-back guarantees ranging from 30 to 45 days, so test a few from your actual Frankfurt connection to see what works best for your specific needs.

Remember, the best VPN is the one you'll actually use consistently. Whether you're protecting your morning coffee shop browsing session or securing important financial transactions, having a reliable VPN running in the background is essential for modern Frankfurt living.

My dad was surprisingly alright with me going to the black parade, but BUT SISTIC decided to crash 😃 that's not my main point though. When I checked the website at 1.30pm.. I shit you not everything was GONE like my will to live 


I know mcr is very popular, and like practically one of the four horsemen of emo ( I know Gee rejected that label, but they're emo okay? Okay.) still, I didn't expect tickets to just vanish!!! What upsets me the most though is that I'm really sure many of these tickets were bought up by the dozen, by scalpers, in order to selfishly mark them up and sell them for the amount of money with which you could probably buy 3-5 new laptops. Now if you told me that the tickets were bought by people who genuinely loved the band, I would be really upset and probably cry, but still be happy that at least people in Singapore appreciate mcr's music.


Personally I've been a fan since August 2023. My gateway to mcr was Skylines and turnstiles ( the very first song mcr actually wrote for their very first album after the 9/11 attacks, I brought you my bullets you brought me your love. And I'm super proud to say I have an original pressing of the debut album :3333). After that I kind of just kept listening to the music, and reading YouTube comments about the boys which made me not only love the art, but love the people behind the art. Gerard's love for drawing, and theatre, his love for coffee and his goofiness, Ray's fuckin awesome guitar skills ( which he took typing classes for in order to improve his control and speed) and can we talk about his hair????? I love it? Frank's stage antics like literally kicking Gerard and tackling him on stage during famous last words so hard he broke his ankle. Frank's makeup during the revenge era, his humour. And let's not forget Mikey... Who was ... Well .. Mikey ( seriously dude, you're talking so much you're hogging up the whole interview!!!!!! Talk a little less!!!!). I love his overall style with the beanie and his glasses lol.. just me or does he look like a lesbian aunt sometimes? 


If you couldn't tell, I have a severe my chemical romance hyperfixation. I know lots about them and their music. The band means so much to me and I love their art, and everything they stand for. I love the 4 main albums, b sides, demos, covers and unreleased material. I'm so upset I can't go see my baby boys next year. My dad said that on Monday when he returns to work he'll try asking coworkers if they know where else to buy tickets or if they know anyone who can't go or is willing to sell a ticket... I feel so bad honestly like I don't want him to go through the trouble, but I think he realizes how much this band means to me


If you're one of the lucky people going to see the guys in April, have fun and sing along when they perform okay?

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. As of I'm playing Cyberpunk. Destiny 2 too but not as much since the new expansion is a month out. And helldivers. Massive warhammer 40k fan. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

Bonus points if you like dancing queen. Medical problems - cause I do. Or would be up game on Xbox or ps5. And spamming me pet pics. 

It should be noted I'm pretty sarcastic and dry sense of humor. Has a 12 year old sense of humor. Also can't forgot my ability to say a random historical fact.

1lykxr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1lykxr2/what_to_do_in_oxford_for_a_day_for_free/,What to do in Oxford for a day for free?,"Last weekend, I finally took a day trip to Oxford, and I'm still amazed by how much you can experience there without spending a penny. I've lived in London for years but never made the time to visit this historic university town. What a mistake that was!

The city center is incredibly walkable, and most colleges let you peek through their gates even if you don't pay for entry. I spent hours just wandering through the narrow cobblestone streets, admiring the stunning architecture that dates back centuries.

My favorite spot was definitely the Radcliffe Camera - that iconic round building you see in all the Oxford photos. While you can't go inside without a tour, the exterior view is absolutely spectacular. I must have taken dozens of photos from different angles.

The University Church of St. Mary the Virgin offers one of the best free views of Oxford. From the churchyard, you get a perfect shot of the Radcliffe Camera and surrounding colleges. Speaking of colleges, Christ Church's courtyard is visible from the street, and you can often spot where they filmed Harry Potter scenes.

I spent a good hour in the Covered Market, which has been around since the 1770s. Even if you don't buy anything, it's fascinating to explore the traditional shops and soak in the atmosphere. The smell of fresh bread and coffee is incredible.

One hidden gem I discovered was the Ashmolean Museum - completely free entry! It's Oxford's oldest museum and houses everything from Egyptian mummies to modern art. I could have easily spent the entire day there.

Port Meadow was another highlight - a huge open space where you can watch students rowing on the Thames (or Isis as it's known here). Pack a picnic and join the locals lounging by the river.

While I managed to see quite a bit on my own, I later discovered that organized tours can offer a much deeper understanding of Oxford's rich history and get you inside some of those beautiful buildings that aren't open to the public. If you're interested in a more comprehensive experience, I found this great tour that combines Oxford with Stratford-upon-Avon and the Cotswolds: https://athometouch.com/London

The walking paths along the canals are also fantastic for a peaceful stroll. I followed the Oxford Canal Walk and spotted narrowboats, wildlife, and some lovely waterside pubs. You don't need to spend money to enjoy the views, though a pint in a historic pub is tempting!

For book lovers, browsing Blackwell's Bookshop is a must. The Norrington Room in the basement is massive, and you're welcome to browse even if you don't buy anything.

Don't miss the Bodleian Library courtyard - the architecture is breathtaking. While the interior tours cost money, the exterior and courtyard are free to explore.

I finished my day watching the sunset from University Parks, another beautiful free space where you can watch cricket matches in summer or enjoy the autumn colors.

My biggest tip? Get there early to avoid crowds, wear comfortable shoes, and bring a water bottle. Oxford can get busy with tourists, but early mornings are peaceful and perfect for photography.

Looking back, I wish I'd known about some of the guided tours that could have given me access to places I couldn't enter on my own. But even without spending money, Oxford offered an unforgettable day out.",1,1752384291.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

1lykxia,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CaptainCarlisle27944/comments/1lykxia/the_red_mirror_part_5/,The Red Mirror (Part 5),"I woke up the following morning to her still in bed, not moving. I slowly started coming to, unwrapping myself from her. Must not have moved at all last night. I slowly got up from the bed, stretching and doing neck stretches. I grabbed my phone, and headed to the living room, looking at my phone. I realized I had the three calls from Ms. Robertson. I called her back.

Hey, Ms. Robertson.
Hey, young man. How's your morning?
Good so far. Just started. Got up not even 5 minutes ago. I'm sorry I missed your call.
That's fine. I had a question about something.
Yeah, sure.
Dalia and Shia... The sisters who ran this antique shop. Their names sound familiar.
Uh, yeah, sure, I guess.
I've been a part of your family for quite some time. Your family tree has heritages and bloodlines in Louisiana.

I paused to think. I slowly started to generate puzzle pieces in my mind. I wasn't entirely sure what to think. Could this job be an internal family project? I wouldn't have even thought about that.

So you think this was an internal job?
It's not off the table, hon. Ask your mother about your family tree, specifically your roots within Louisiana. It's a shot in the dark, but at least cover all your bases.
Sure, I'll ask when I'm at the house today. How's the mirror coming?
There's been a development with the mirror actually.
Oh? Good or bad?
Depends on how you take it.
Uhhhh wha-
There was another layer of pictures with more phrases and spells. None of these people look familiar. I'm saving all of these pictures for you. After looking around in the chassis of the mirror for anything else, I purged the whole mirror and cleaned it thoroughly. Nothing is left in it. It's ready to sell.
Thank you for your time and for doing this. And please save everything you get out of that thing. 
Okay let me get back to it. Thanks for getting back to me.
Yeah no problem. Least I could do. Have a good day.
You too. Bye.
Bye.

Hanging up. I saw movement. Looking up, Van was walking in, rubbing her hair, and yawning.
""Sleep well?"" I asked.
""Like a rock."" Van answered.
I was prepared for her to sit next to me, but she was direct, plopping down in my lap. I put my phone down, and stared at her. ""Well, this is new.""
""You mind this?"" Van said, smiling at me.
""Absolutely I do not mind."" I speedingly responded.
The light from the windows dancing across the pine floor, singing around us and the furniture, illuminating her hair and part of her face. Her brown hair almost turned bronze in the light, her eyes turning emerald in the sun. A woman turned goddess in the proper lighting. I found myself staring, like a lowly servant to the Queen. She slowly got closer, hugging me from the side. Trying to play it cool. 
""I... You're absolutely stunning."" I stuttered out, trying to break the incrementally increasing sexual tension in the room. 
She smiled, raising an eyebrow. ""You should see when I'm dressed up.""
""I love how you look now."" I said, more confident in my words.
""You're just saying that."" She commented, shaking out her hair.
""No. I'm serious."" I said, staring at her. I didn't know the move now, now locked staring at each other. She leaned in, closer to me, the tension at an all time high. I was seconds away from getting the first kiss when the knocking of the front broke all tension immediately. She cleared her throat, and glanced at me. ""Don't worry. We can try again later."" She said, winking at me. She hopped off my lap, and went to the front door. I sat there, mildly pissed off the moment was destroyed by a visitor. I watched as she opened the door, Mom and Dad standing there. Mom had a binder in her hand, and Dad had what looked like a dish in his hand. She brought them in, setting their items on the dining room table. Dad came over while Van and Mom talked.
""Sup sport?"" He said, standing behind me on the couch, his hands on my shoulders.
""Same old, same old, Dad."" I responded.
He leaned in behind me, getting close to my ear.
""Anything happened last night, son?"" He asked.
""No. Slept in the same bed, but nothing. She didn't want to do anything. But we are a couple now."" I whispered.
He patted his hands on my shoulders. ""Wait till your mom finds out. She's gonna be elated. Expect an attack hug when she finds out.""
He laughed as I drew out a sigh. I'd already prepared for the attack hug. He walked away, and went back to Mom while I went to the kitchen for some water. ""Hey, Mom."" I said, smiling.
""Good morning."" Mom said, coming in for a hug. I hugged her, and took a drink of water. Vanessa and Mom sat on the couch and talked, while Dad was taking a business call. I sat in grandfather's chair, turning on the TV at a low volume while activity was going on. I started to wonder about the binder Mom bought.
""Hey Mom. What's with the binder?"" I asked. She turned around to face me.
""I got a text message from Ms. Robertson about our family tree. She said you might have asked about it, so I brought it over.""
""Well, that takes care of that question."" I said out loud.
Mom chuckled. ""She wanted you to look at it because of the mirror.
I got up, and looked at the binder marked FAMILY TREE. I grabbed the binder, and sat back down in my grandfathers chair. Mom and Van continued to talk, ultimately Dad joined them on the couch. I flipped through the pages, our line going back to the prohibition era. Mom had done a good job in categorizing everything, with a photo of the person, place of origin, their standing within the family, and finally, their final place of residency before death. The first pages were current family. Then the history began. I flipped through the pages, studying each face, all the details. As I slowly went further back, a lump formed in my throat. I didn't want to find out if the thing that's been responsible for the death of two people was a demonic family heirloom. I got past the Texas section, the California section, North Carolina section, past three more states before arriving at one of the final states. Louisiana. The knot in my throat grew. I glanced up to see Vanessa walking towards me, and sitting down next to me on the chair. Mom and Dad now looking at us both.
""I have something to announce."" Van said, looking at me. ""Me and your son are now dating.""
My eyes went big, now seeing my mothers reaction. Her eyes got big, and she got up to hug me.
""You're doing this now, lady? She's getting ready to attack me."" I whispered.
""I know. Give me the book."" I gave her the book, and she got up. I got up, and with seconds to brace, Mom attacked hugged me. Her soul clenching bear hugs almost rivaled my own. 
""So proud of you son. You got a good one. You mess this up, Imma hurt you."" She said, still draining my soul through her bear hug.
""Okay, okay, okay. You're already hurting me."" I said, trying to contain my pain behind my voice. She unclasped her grip, and pulled away, looking at me. ""I knew you could do it."" She said. She went to the couch again, and Vanessa gave me the binder back as I sat down again.
""Good work, big man."" Dad said, sipping his glass of tea. Acknowledging his response, I refocused on the book. I pulled the Louisiana starting page back, and started reading. The first few photos and members were nothing special, until I got to a woman named Shia. Shia Tajlia. Sister to Dalia. Living in Louisiana. My eyes widened. I almost dropped the book. My biggest fear was now realized. The family made the mirror. And my grandfather knew. He would've had to have known right? All of it was too much. I snapped the binder shut, causing my mom to look over. 
""The mirror was made by the family."" I said out loud. Mom and Dad were now looking at me. 
""You're... You're certain?"" Mom asked.
""I'm certain."" I answered.
I glanced at Vanessa, who looked confused. 
""I'll tell you later. It's a lot to take in."" I said.
""Okay, can't wait for this."" She responded.
""The origin of the mirror doesn't matter now. It's being handled. Once the mirror is back here, we sell it and be done with it."" Dad spoke up. ""Getting tired of it being the center of attention.""
""I agree."" Mom said, readjusting in her seat. ""Origin aside, I'm ready for it to be gone.""
""Mom. This thing was made within the family. The mirror wasn't made by chance. This isnt a friendly mirror you put on the wall, and leave it for others to marvel at. I don't need to remind you what it's capable of.""
Mom stared at me, thinking. ""Why would your grandfather make something like that? To protect us?""
""That answer, unfortunately, we will never know. Not unless we do a scance or something. Hard to get answers from a lump of dirt.""
""That's enough."" Dad interjected. ""Not going to have a fight over this. I've seen the interior of the mirror myself, and it was not what I was expecting."" He pointed at me for a second. ""Don't rattle the cage. You and I, hell, we all know what it's capable of. And it won't be a threat to anyone anymore.""
I sighed, and lightly threw the binder on the coffee table. Vanessa looking at me, confused.
""She doesn't know, does she?"" Mom asked me. Van now perked up, looking at my mother.
""No."" I responded, slowly pulling myself all the way to the back of the seat to get more comfortable. Van looked confused still.
""Vanessa, would you like to know what took your dad?"" Mom asked.
I looked over at Vanessa, who was locked on to my mother. ""Yeah, I would.""
Dad was now sitting with Mom, arm on the backrest.
""You're going to call us crazy."" Mom commented.
""I'm half Native American. My mother was pure Cherokee. I've seen some odd things in my life. Try me."" Vanessa said.
I glanced at Mom, letting out a quiet sigh. 
""The mirror killed your dad."" My mother said, being brutally fast with it. The room fell silent for what felt like 5 minutes. Vanessa started at Mom, then stared at me. I stared back at her, unable to say anything. She looked back at Mom and Mom began to speak again.
""The mirror was an item left behind in my father's will, left to my son. After we uncovered it, things started happening. Odd noises, and sounds. It killed one of our family members too, along with your father. We discovered that a prolonged exposure to the mirror resulted in death by suicide. Our family member stared at it, went home, and several hours, he was discovered in his bedroom. After the photos were sent to your father, a few days later, his assistant called and let us know he was gone. We now have the mirror in another person's possession."" 
""Our cousin was never suicidal, just like your father."" I said. ""It was incredibly odd that all of a sudden, went and did what they did. It was a big shock to the family when our cousin went and did... that. Could only imagine how you felt when you got your news. When we took the mirror to Ms. Robertson, Dad and I saw the extent of how much was done to the mirror. Spells and charms with pictures of the family in the interior of the mirror. The text inside was written in blood, made by a distant relative in Louisiana. The whole thing is just really fucked. I was gonna tell you later, but Mom beat me to it.""
Van looked at the ground, seemingly lost in thought. She'd been quiet the whole time, absorbing yet another word dump like she did with me yesterday. She put her hand on my knee, lost in thought still. I glanced at Mom, now taking a sip of her water with Dad rubbing her back. I glanced back at Van. She remained in her state of wrapping her head around what was just said. When I went to get up, she clenched her hand on my knee, signalling me to stay. She needed me there. I slowly went back to my previous position on the chair. Mom and Dad got up, Mom grabbing her purse. ""I think we are going to go. Enjoy the food we dropped off. If you need anything, you know where to find us.""
""Thanks Mom. Love y'all."" I said. I watched them shuffle out the house.
""Son, you want the door locked?"" Dad asked.
""Yes, please."" I responded.
Dad locked the door, and pulled it to behind him. The silence in the house was incredibly loud. She looked up after thinking for awhile. She glanced at me. ""I need to take a minute. I'll be in the bedroom for a little while."" I nodded. 
""Okay. Take as much time as you need."" I said. She gave me a half smile, before getting up, and walking to the bedroom. I was in an empty living room. Should I go with her? Probably not. Anytime someone I knew or loved was in emotional distress or dealing with something heavy, I'd always leave them alone unless otherwise told. I didn't want to be the one who'd say, oh it'll be alright, or there there, it's alright it'll be okay. People deal with emotional things differently. I just didn't want to be that person. I slumped in my chair, thinking. My train of thought slammed the emergency brake on when my phone dinged. It was Ms. Robertson.

Mirror is ready, young man. Pick it up when you're ready.

I put my phone down, happy to read that. For the next few hours, I took a nap in my seat. I woke up to the smell of coffee, Vanessa sitting on the couch. She was sipping a cup of coffee with several cookies on the plate it was on, watching TV on a low volume. I glanced at the clock. 7:00. Van noticed me coming to. She got up, and came close. ""Hey."" She said. ""You okay?""
I nodded. I sat up, and she again sat on my lap. I rubbed my eyes and got the sleep out of my eyes, refocusing on her. She was staring at me intently. 
""So, you really think the mirror did it?"" She asked.
""Yes. It's too much of a coincidence in both cases to not assume it isn't supernatural."" I responded. She put her arms around me, now hugging me. I could feel everything. The emotional toil withering away. The mirror now a distant demonic item, now restored to its inanimate family heirloom. Van staring at me, our foreheads touching. I closed my eyes for a few seconds, letting out a small breath. Whatever she was doing to me to help calm me was working. After a few minutes of embraced silence, she pulled her arms back, and sat still in my lap. I grabbed my phone, called Dad, and put him on speakerphone. 

Hey, Dad.
Hey. What do ya got for me?
Got a text from Ms. Robertson. The mirror is ready.
Good, good. I'm glad the mirror is normal. Not like it was before.
Yeah, got a point. Was wondering when we could pick it up. When's a good day for you?
We can be there tomorrow morning. You want your morning or my morning?

I paused. My dad wakes up everyday at 4 in the morning. It was his military hardwiring still there even after his retirement almost 35 years ago. My morning is between 9-10am. 

My morning, Dad. 
Okay absolutely. I'll be there around, say, 11?
That'll work.
Did Vanessa want to come? Got plenty of room in the truck.

I looked at Vanessa, almost asking the question through my expression. ""Yeah."" Van said. ""I'll go if you want. Don't have anything else to do except wait for the funeral.""

Yeah. She's onboard, Dad.
Okay. Cool. Two hour road trip coming up. I think Mom wants to come as well. Guess it'll be all hands on deck for the trip.
Good. It'll be closure for everyone, including Van.
Absolutely. Well, that's good. Okay. Anything else?
No, no, Dad. That's it. I appreciate it. I'll pay for the gas.
That's not necessary. I got it. I didn't charge you for the first trip, I'm not doing it now.
Okay. Love ya. Staying here again tonight.
Okay. Remember my advice. Love ya. Night.
Night.

I hung up, placing my phone on the armrest. Van was looking at me. I looked at her. Felt like we were back at where we were this morning. She started getting close again, inches away. We stared into each other's soul at this point. And it happened. Odd for me, since I had this a handful of times, but this felt different. She pulled away after it. My heart skipped a beat. I felt incredibly better. Like it was her helping me out of this batshit insane period of my life. I did my best to keep the demons away in my everyday life. And just when I was doing well, and just when I thought the castle walls didn't have to be so high, the Trojan horse rolled in, and crumbled the castle walls within days. The pain and the emotional roller coaster ride was over and we were slowly puttering into the station, ready to get off the ride. Vanessa got up, and grabbed my hand. 
""You wanna go get something to eat?"" She asked.
""No. Honestly not hungry."" I said.
""Then to bed, maybe?"" She asked a new question.
I stared at her. She smiled, not a usual smile. A smirk with an eyebrow raised. I knew that look. I knew that from the other girlfriends I've had before. I got up, still holding hands with Van. She playfully dragged me to the master bedroom, giggling softly. She closed the bedroom door behind her.

I could tell you what happened that night, but I don't think I have to. The night was ours. But the next day is the reason why I'm writing this out. The most dramatic day of this entire story.

1lykv8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CaptainCarlisle27944/comments/1lykv8j/red_mirror_part_4/,Red Mirror (Part 4),"I woke up slowly in the AM, seeing the back of Ms. Robertsons head before the door was closed behind her. I slowly started to smell something in the room. Getting up and stretching, I noticed the plate of biscotti in a fan pattern with a cup of coffee waiting on the side table. I ate the pieces, and finished the coffee before heading out the room, and down the hallway. The first person I noticed was Dad. He was sitting at the table, answering a text. ""Hey, hey, there he is. Sleep good?""
""Little too well honestly."" I said, popping my back. Ms. Robertson seemed to pop out of thin air, taking my plate I was holding. She startled me a little bit. I sat down with Dad. I glanced over my shoulder to see Ms. Robertson in the kitchen.
""You ready to go?"" I asked to Dad.
""Whenever you are ready."" He responded.
""Ms. Robertson? We are leaving soon. Do you need anything else?"" I said, throwing out a line for her to catch.
""No, young man. Youre good for now."" She said, now standing behind us. She pat the chair backing of both of our chairs, and moved for us to get up. Dad and I got up, and followed her to the garage leading outside. The mirror had reassembled overnight, and was facing down. The backing was closed, and screws redone. We all stopped, and looked. Ms. Robertson and I exchanged looks. I couldn't help but feel slightly uneasy around the mirror. Even though I know it was going to be dealt with, I had reservations about leaving it with her. Dad and I climbed back into the truck, and prepped to leave.
""If you need anything, Ms. Robertson. Anything at all... please don't hesitate to call."" Dad said.
""Yes, please, call us."" I added.
Ms. Robertson smiled. ""I'm good with what I have. When it's ready, I will call. Go home. Rest easy. I got it."" 
""All right then."" Dad said while starting the car. As I was getting my seatbelt on, Ms. Robertson backed away of the truck, and waved as we pulled out the driveway and onto the road heading home. The trip home was mostly quiet, other then talking about his work and a possible promotion. 2 hours later, we pulled into home. Mom was waiting. We got out, relieved to be home. Mom hugged Dad, and I slowly made my way inside. Entering the house, I plopped down on the couch, and answered two more texts from family members before Mom came in. It was already 2 in the afternoon, since me and Dad apparently slept in at Ms. Robertsons house. 
""By the way, Josh, Vanessa came over to see you this morning.""
Mom said, Dad following her in. 
""She... She did?"" I said. ""Did she say why?""
""No, but she wanted to see you."" Mom answered.
""I'll call her."" I said, locating her in my contacts.
""That's not necessary. I already told her you were home. She will be here soon."" Mom said. I closed my contacts out.
""Really, Mom?"" I said, giving her the stank eye.
""She's nice, she's cute, she likes you."" Mom said, teasing me.
""Mom..."" I muttered, one of my hands on my face, shaking my head.
""I want grandkids."" Mom teased.
""Mom!"" I rose my voice, slightly laughing.
Before Mom reacted, we heard knocking on the door.
""Come in, hon!"" Mom yelled. The door swung open, and Vanessa walked in. Curves. Glasses. Some tattoos. Brown hair. Piercing green eyes. She was beautiful. It's been almost three years since we had seen each other. She'd changed a lot since then. A small lump in my throat formed. I got up to say hey, but was met with an attack hug. Wincing, all I could get out was, ""Hey girl. Wow, you're strong."" She let me go, and stared at me for a second. 
""Nice to see you again."" She said. She sat down on the couch, and I sat again next to her. I was flustered clearly. I glanced over at my mother, now sitting with Dad.
""So..."" Mom started. ""You're here for the funeral obviously, but what is to become of the shop, hon?""
""The shop will be sold. I see me being here for at least a month after the funeral. I'm staying at a friend's place right now, but it's cramped.""
""That doesn't sound very good."" Mom said. She was looking at me, almost as if to say something but not say something.
My brain reacted. ""I got a house you can stay in."" 
Vanessa turned her head to me. ""You do?""
I nodded. ""It was my grandfather's. Left to me in the will. You can use it while you're here."" 
""Cool. How far is it from here?"" Vanessa asked.
""Mmmmm.... Five minutes."" I thought out loud and said.
""Can you... Can you take me?"" She asked.
I glanced over at my mom, now locked onto me, sipping her tea. ""Yeah sure, absolutely."" I answered. I don't know what came over me, but something snapped. If I was going to try to get a chance, it was now. I got on my phone, and typed out a paragraph. I knew she was going to the mountains after her time here, so our time would be limited. She kept a conversation going with Mom and Dad while I was typing:

I need to talk to you when we get to my grandfather's house about something. Its been pressing for a while now. I want to talk about us possibly being a couple.

I hit send, and listened in on the conversation.
""Colorado is nice honestly. Went when I was in the service."" Dad said. ""But North Dakota is better. Cold as hell, but nice.""
""Yeah, it was. We went on vacation once."" Mom added. ""We really liked North Dakota.... Minus the bears."" 
""Oh yeah, the bear."" Dad said, laughing.
""What happened?"" Vanessa asked.
""Oh, bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches with mayo and barbeque sauce is delicious as a breakfast for humans... And apparently for bears as well.""
Mom cringed. ""Theres nothing that wakes you up more then a bear clearing the wooden picnic table of your breakfast when you step away to pee."" 
Dad nodded, while taking a sip of tea. ""I'd went to pee, and... Bear. It was crazy. Like hey, theres a 900 pound bear looking for food. Eats the sandwiches, clears the plates off, stares at our RV, huffs, and stomps into the forest.""
Vanessa, at this point, is shaking her head laughing.
""But thank God we made extra. Ate that inside. We stayed in the RV until the final day was over. Then we high-tailed it out of there."" Mom said. 
""Yeah. It was crazy."" Dad added.
I glanced at the clock. 4 in the afternoon. Vanessa now picked up her phone for the first time since the conversation. She read it, and looked at me for almost 10 seconds. Mom and Dad kept the conversation going on themselves. Her eyes locked with mine. She read it.
""Well, you got a house to get to now."" Mom said, breaking our stare.
""Yes, we do. Want to go now?"" I asked her, still hand-in-hand.
""Sure. If you're ready."" She answered. I unclasped my hand, and got up, Vanessa got up with me, stretching. 
""We need to go to my friend's house first so I can get my stuff."" She said to me. 
""Yeah, absolutely."" I said. I walked up to the kitchen counter and grabbed my keys. Leaving the house, I got in the car, opening her door for her. We eased out the house, and drove to her friend's place. After grabbing her stuff, we went to the house. Her face was priceless. 
""Wow. Your grandfather was here?"" She asked.
""Yeah."" I replied. ""One of my favorite houses ever. You'll see why."" We both got out, and I grabbed her stuff. Two duffels bags worth. I tossed the keys to her, and she opened the house. As we stepped in, her face lit up. 
""Wow, this is incredible. It's like a hunters lodge in here!"" She said, looking around the living room at the animals on the floor and the walls. The house smells of fresh pine and cedar due to the materials it's made from. It's always refreshing to come here. Couldn't help but stare at her, her excitedness over the house just made her even more attractive. I went to the master bed room, dropped off the bags on the side table. The master bedroom itself was a marvel on its own, with the biggest hunts and biggest heads in here. The ceilings were 12 feet tall, and all the animals were mounted above and out the way. The cedar logs making the walls added to the scent of the room. The four poster bed was a masterpiece on its own, with its base made of a reclaimed California Redwood tree trunk with the four posts of the bed made from 10 inch thick hand carved columns. Eagles, Owls, Bears, Deer, Elk, and Turkeys lined the posts. The master bedroom was as big as the living room, with its own set of two couches, and a coffee table. A table by the door was used as a catch all, with hooks over the table for coats and backpacks. I came back out to find Vanessa sitting on the couch, taking in the room. She saw me, and motioned me over. I sat next to her, our trip to her friend's, and the trip to the house was dead silent. She looked like she wanted to talk.
""You have a funny way of asking people out."" She said.
""As the text said, I don't do well with that."" I responded.
""How long have you liked me?"" She asked.
""High School."" I replied. ""I liked you in high school, but your circle of friends scared me. I couldn't get close. I was in the social rejects group, and you were in the socially acceptable group. Over the years, we see each other at events, and every time. I kick myself for not saying anything. I got the courage to do it finally. I'm not very good at relationships, starting them anyways. I'm too chicken shit honestly.""
She looked at me, absorbing my emotional dump. ""Yeah, I have to admit I have the same problem. Not very good at starting relationships. But I liked you too. My friends knew. I was expecting you to make a move.""
""Again... Not my best strategy."" I said.
""Yeah. My friends scared you?"" She asked.
""Uhhhh, yeah. Rachel? Francesca? Alice?"" I answered.
She raised her eyebrows, and let out a sigh. ""Yeah... Nevermind."" She said, chuckling. ""How did you get Francesca's sister?""
""In high school? All our interests were aligned. We dated for only three months. She wanted someone to talk to, I wanted to hang out with her outside of school. Only reason why she ended it was she moved.""
""Oh, yeah I remember that."" Vanessa said. ""Francesca left two weeks after she did. Military families, right?""
""Right."" I said. I could feel the tension lifting as the conversation continued.
""So... This is a yes?"" I asked.
She stared at me for a solid 5 seconds before saying ""I have to make some calls to my folks, but that's gonna be a yes. I'll give you a chance.""
My mind lifted to new heights. But a text came up on my phone that wrapped a rope around my emotions and dragged them back to reality. It was a text from Ms. Robertson. Text, more like a novel:

Hey young man. Got some news for you on the background of the mirror. I reached out to a friend of mine who lives in Louisiana, and he researched The Green Dahlia. He discovered the origin of the store. It was a store with the owners heritage going all the way back to the slave days. There were two twin sisters, Dalia and Shia. Shia was into witchcraft, but she dabbled in it. She wasn't as dedicated to it as her sister was. The year this was made aligns to the time when Dalia was in charge, and she was heavy into the witchcraft scene, absorbing anything she could find on the subject. She was likely the person who made the mirror. She was arrested for cult like behavior, multiple accounts of murder, and animal mutilation. She passed away in jail. The store was ultimately raided and closed down by the local police department. Her sister, Shia, lived to be the age of 104 before passing. Just letting you know what I've uncovered. The purging incantation is over. I'll be purging the back with holy water next. Hope you have a good evening. I'll talk to you soon.

After reading it, I got a text from Dad:

Hey son. Mom wants to know if you're coming home soon.

Vanessa, now staring at me, spoke up. ""You staying the night?""
""Yes."" I said. ""Not gonna leave you alone.""
She smiled. That's all I needed.

Hey Dad. I'll be spending the night here.

Okay. If anything happens... Wear a wrap. You know what I mean. Have a good night. I'll see you in the AM.

I laughed at Dad's text, showing Vanessa. She smirked, and shook her head. She got up, and went to the bathroom, while I got up, and went to the kitchen. I grabbed some water and a pack of Fig Newtons, and sat back down to my phone. I answered a few more texts and an email before she came back out. ""I'm gonna take a shower if that's alright.""
My eyes must have gotten wide internally. ""Yeah. Absolutely."" I said. She disappeared again. I decided to actually make food, going back to the kitchen, and prepping pasta with tomato sauce and fresh shavings of Parmigiana Reggiano as a topper. I cooked for almost 30 minutes before she came back out, towel wrapped hair, and a sleeping gown on. ""Smells good out here."" She said.
I threw the kitchen towel on my shoulder. ""Thank you. Foods almost ready.""
""You're full of surprises."" She said, now sitting at the bar attached to the kitchen.
""I was taught how to cook from both my parents. Northern mother, and a southern father. Best of both worlds."" I said, ladling a serving of sauce on the noodles. ""Grandma was next. The master of southern feasts. Every Sunday after church, she'd be in the kitchen, making food. If you left her house hungry, it was your own damn fault."" 
Vanessa laughed at the statement. I served her plate before mine. We ate a late dinner, and I cleaned up after. Once the kitchen was cleaned, I went to the couch and sat down. She sat down, and her head on my lap, laying down on the couch. 
""You comfortable?"" I asked.
""Yeah, I am."" She answered.
""You got a nickname?"" I asked.
""My friends called me Van. You can call me that."" She answered.
""Cool. That's good to me."" I said.
I couldn't help but I stare at her. How things would be different. When the mirrors gone, my life will be infinitely better. We watched TV till around midnight before she wanted to turn in. We both got up, and went down the hallway to the master bedroom.
""There ya go, lady. I'll be in the guest bedroom."" I said.
""What?"" She asked.
""I'm going to the guest bedroom.....?"" I trailed off.
""Uh, no. No you're not. Get in here."" She proceeded to grab me and pull me in the master bedroom. I was slightly anxious, hoping this wouldn't turn into something else. She walked to the bed, and got in. I was reluctant at first, but slowly made my way to the bed, and climbed in. 
""First time?"" She teased.
""No. Just a little surprised."" I said.
""I don't bite.... Hard."" Van teased.  I edged my way over to her side, unsure of what to do. I was terribly bad at this. I slowly wrapped my arms around her, and got comfortable. How I slept that was heavenly. When I did black out.",1,1752384041.0,u_CaptainCarlisle27944,0,1.0,False

First Gig down today and it was a blast/nerve wracking/fun/exhausting time. 1.5 hours at a coffee shop Grand opening doing minimal progressive house to tech house to electro pop to a big room finish.
Random thoughts along the way:
1. Crashes happen. Rekordbox crashed 10min into my set, just rebooted, did a spin back and we were going again. It sucks but not the end of the world
2. Random things happen, roll with it: I had to move my booth (the ""booth"" was a cart on wheels) for someone from a joined restaurant to open a door to go throw trash away. Threw me off a bit but kept on rolling
3. Small mistakes happen, do your best to play it off: I paused the main deck for half second and accidentally key shifted +7 vs +1. It was an ""oops"" moment but if you keep the mix going most people won't care
4. (And this should be 1) Song selection above all else: I had multiple people come up to me and say they loved my choices. Not the transitions or the blends/mashups but the song choices. Be confident in your taste and make sure to play to the crowd.

I'm only 2 weeks into introductions to business owners & managers, but have not gotten any contact. Again, 2 weeks and about 40 pamphlets & cards, so i'm not discouraged or anything, but would like to course-correct to save myself time if i'm not going about this the best way possible.

I'm targeting small businesses, mainly coffee cafés, small boutiques, a couple breweries, and some other businesses alike.

Am I wasting my time doing it this way? Again, i'm not expecting e-mails busting down my door yet, but would like to gather any advice from freelancers who can share how they received their first client! I don't have family that runs businesses or know anyone who does, so i'm on the hunt!

I find that I absolutely can't stand myself when I drink coffee with this medication.

I suffer from clinically diagnosed depression, anxiety and (good God!) post-traumatic stress disorder related to an adolescence of nihilism, isolation and restless angst and despair related to the individualism and sedentary qualities of high school. And all of this -- combined with the physiology of ingesting stimulant meds -- just kills me. But without the stimulants I am completely worthless to myself and have a horrifically ""blank slate"" orientation toward the world.

(24F/24M),"I (24F) have been crushing over my childhood friend (24M) and now we're both single, I'm stuck between keeping him as a friend or tell him how I really feel. Let's just name him John.

We had history. When we were both 16 yrs old, we had a mutual understanding. I was his crush and he was mine. But we only talked for 3mons and my mother made us end things between us saying that we were just kids and that if we were really for each other, we will find our way back to each other in the future. He moved on pretty quickly, while I kept liking him until I met my first boyfriend when I was 19yrs old. So I liked him for a long time, and tbh, if it wasn't for my first boyfriend (and second because i have 2 exes), my feelings for him would have never changed. But after my second failed relationship, I just lost interest in love and relationships and so everything i felt towards dating in general, I set them all aside and focused on my career and myself. 

Last 2023, we started being friends again. We belong in a church band which made us closer because there were a lot of moments that we get to bond since we are in the same circle of friends. We had conversations where we got caught up with each other's lives and I noticed that since we were born the same year, our experiences and timeline were somehow a lil bit the same and we can really relate to each other. That's when a lot of our friends started to notice that our closeness is in a way, special. And since they know about what we had when we were kids, they started teasing us saying that we actually look good together. At first, I was just tagging along their jokes, laughing at it too, not taking those jokes seriously 'cause again, I'm not interested anymore and I plan to stay single for a while and I do not plan on liking someone at that moment. 

So we just continued our friendship. Nothing special, just being completely platonic. We have so many things in common, that we can talk about anything. We were like magnets, wherever he sits, I was right there beside him. Same goes for John, wherever I am, he's there too. In every picture, every sitting arrangement, it's either we're next to each other or facing each other. It's very rare that we're not physically close whenever we're in the same area. We feel very comfortable.

It felt really normal and wholesome.. until our friends confronted us. 

One Sunday, we all got coffee as we usually do, me and John were sitting right next to each other, as always, when our friends started to confront us about how we have our own little bubble whenever we talk to each other. They were saying that whenever we talk, it's like no one else is in the table, only the 2 of us. That we have the same wavelength, we have such strong chemistry and visible connection that we ourselves were not aware of. Of course John defended us saying that however we treat each other, we do the same to all of our friends. And then they go about our body language and how we look at each other. They were really pushing us to say that there's something going on between us,, but the truth is, there's just nothing. 

I came home that night trying to analyze what was said during our coffee sesh and maybe I was overwhelmed. I was just not aware that we were seen like that, but on my end it was all normal. As I was recalling all the times that me and John bonded, all of a sudden, I felt butterflies in my stomach. And then of course I panicked.. because I wasn't sure if I am starting to like him again. I'm just not ready to like someone again, I don't wanna go down that road anymore, or maybe not just yet. And besides, we're really good friends, we know a lot of stuff about each other and I just wanna keep it that way.

As we continued going out with our friends, memories of me and John just piled up in my head and at first I was totally denying it, but eventually I accepted that I actually like him. It was hard to admit.. because I know for a fact that I'm not his type, not even close hahahaha </3. But something in me says that we have good chemistry because he might feel the same. I know it's wrong to give myself false hope, but just the way we connect to each other, how we bond, I can't help but to think that we actually have a shot. I know, it's a mistake and I'm just being overwhelmed by how I feel.

So I'm stuck if I should just tell him, or keep it safe and continue being friends with him.",1,1752383304.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1lykmky,https://www.reddit.com/r/vipassana/comments/1lykmky/isolation_as_hindrance/,isolation as hindrance..,"i did my first 10 day Goenka retreat in November 2015 and was life changing, sonce then i did 3 more 10 days , including the Satipathana, and served 4 times, also attended other monasteries in Thai forest tradition whoch is essentially still practice of Dhamma although different to Goenka  structure of practice.

at times i have had a good home practice at other time ive lost it completely, mostly due to the fact i become very isolated from others in my demographic and in society when i practice Vipassana consistently..

i was alway a bit of an outsider, as many who come to 'spiritual practice' might be, myself mostly associating with outsiders and alternative party 'scene' since a young age

as a consequence more my peers have always been into drink and drugs, breaking sila/moral conduct of Vipassana.

to this day im an artist and most of my peers also are and the people i really like in life. who like to drink and smoke weed and party etc outside of work, it is very integrated in the life style e.g. leave the studio together to go bar, or smoke weed with a beer at the end of work day or weekend.

in the periods where i maintained sila and meditation practice i found my self drifting away from peers, no being able to connect because others wanna drink together, having to leave early to go meditate, etc. and then i find people dont want to be around me as my conduct is a dampener, as most people know these hedonistic behaviours are not the best for health and someone who is avoid it is a reminder ( that how ive analysed so far), we just become different vibrations i feel.

so in periods of good meditation and sila i found my self disconnected from my sub-culture and peers and wider society, which was always hard for me to ' fit in' anyway.. so at times in the last 10 year ive have drifted from meditation..

then life becomes unmanageable or conflicted, e.g. i had 1 pint of beer yesterday after a month of good sila and felt guilty, my mind saying over, No Intoxicants! i ended up not enjoying it after the short high it gave. 
e.g. i become too much in my head, stop observing breath, emotion and thought take over and unpleasant scenarios manifest in life, so consequentially i reintegrate Sila and meditation to find the balance again. 

to sum up with out waffling to much..

i received so many benefits from practicing Vipassana and know it is better for me and my health and wider community for me to practice Dhamma but when i do i find myself being more isolated from my immediate peers and work opportunities, as networking is a big thing as an artist and general member of society, and a human being who wants friends and has social needs!

it feel like a catch 22, people like when i discuss mediation and Dhamma and teachings of the Buddha and i do my best to practice what i preach, however, it seems novelty to others and is a nice conversation topic at first though not many people really connect through this on the deeper level of actually practicing.

ive rarely met people at courses who i would spend much time with outside of a retreat and meditation sitting, maybe grab a coffee and chat, but i dont find connection with these people like those in the 'alternative' community.

Am i attached to the desire for friendship, social 'needs'? is this just the endless cycle of suffering the Buddha taught about? am i just transitioning slowly between different stages/version of who 'i am'?

I’m hoping to meet someone friendly and kind for a casual coffee, a city walk, or just light conversations in the evening after work. Nothing serious or romantic — just good company to unwind and enjoy the moment.

I'm respectful, soft-spoken, and enjoy simple human connections. If you're looking for the same, feel free to drop a message. Let's make this week a little warmer for both of us, even if just through a walk or a shared cup of coffee.

We moved in together around month 8, and honestly, things felt pretty solid. He was sweet, thoughtful, made coffee in the mornings, folded laundry without being asked. I really thought I found “my person.” 

The only thing that ever made me pause was his ex. Let’s call her Rena. They dated for a few years before me and he told me they’d stayed “on good terms.” I wasn’t thrilled, but I didn’t want to be the jealous, controlling type. He promised there was nothing left there, and I took him at his word.

But over the past year, something changed. He got weird with his phone. Always stepping out to take “quick calls.” Rena’s name would pop up, and suddenly he’d close the screen or say she was just “asking for advice.” I brought it up a few times, but he’d brush it off and make me feel like I was just being paranoid.

Then last month, I went out of town for a weekend to visit my sister. When I came back, the vibe was off. You know when someone’s being extra nice, but it feels like guilt wrapped in politeness? That.

A few days later, I used his laptop to order food. And yep, the messages were open. I didn’t even have to dig. They’d hooked up. He admitted it when I confronted him. Said it was a “mistake,” that he didn’t know why he did it, and “it just happened.” Like cheating is something that happens to you, not something you do.

I didn’t yell. I didn’t cause a scene. I just grabbed a few things, said I needed space, and left. Now his friends and even his sister, are telling me I’m being cold. That “one mistake” shouldn’t erase everything we had. That people “slip up.”

But honestly? If the roles were reversed, they’d call me every name in the book. Why is it always women who are expected to be the bigger person? He cheated. Lied. Kept it going. And now I’m supposed to comfort him because he regrets it?

So… AITA for walking away instead of accepting his “mistake”?",76,1752383044.0,TwoHotTakes,58,0.97,False

1lyki3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalEpicUniverse/comments/1lyki3l/trip_report_july_11_no_rope_dropping_no_express/,"Trip Report July 11 - no rope dropping, no express","About us: Family of four -  2 adults, 2 kids who are 4 and 8. We all love thrill rides, even the little one who is barely 40 inches. We are not early risers and Friday July 11th was the 4th consecutive day of us visiting parks so there was no chance we would wake up early enough for rope dropping. I prioritize keeping us happy, hydrated, fed, cool, and on a flexible schedule. I aim to achieve balance between thrilling rides for taller people and rides/attractions that shorter kids can participate in.  

My typical park ""strategy"" at Universal is to arrive anytime between 10 am-12:30 pm and stay until park closes. I monitor wait times on the app and target rides with 30 minute or fewer wait times. On only one trip I've utilized the Express Pass, but only because it was part of a one night stay at Lowe's Portofino. 

I visit on off-peak weeks, not weekends: the week after the July 4th; September during hurricane week,  February during the week; a week in early May, etc. I try very hard to avoid lines. Most of our waits have been 20 minutes or less. 

On July 11th, we did not purchase Express passes for Epic since they were selling for the insane price of $300+ per person.  We did however, have 2 single use, Single Attraction Passes (SAP) paper passes that were given to us.   
  
I know that visiting EPIC for the first time would challenge the way my family normally does things because we've been so spoiled by short wait times. So I steeled myself and prepped them to have low expectations. We aimed to ride a few rides, play some Nintendo games and appreciate the artistry and ambiance of a new park. 

Here's our itinerary: 

**10:45 am-12:45 ish.** 

Arrive. Enter Dark Universe. Ride *Monster's Unchained* with rider swap, enabling the 8 year old to ride twice, back-to-back with each parent. Retrieved ride photos. Restroom and snack break. Posted wait 15 min; in reality it was 20-ish minutes.

All 4 of us ride *Curse of the Werewolf*. Posted wait 35; in reality it was 50-ish minutes, we think the delay was partly due to a clean-up required on the ride. Continue to walk clockwise past the burning Blade Tavern and then refill our water bottles with ice and water at DeLacey's Cottage Coke Freestyle machine. Exit Dark universe (did not peruse stores).

Many posts and tips I've seen say to de-prioritize the rides in Dark Universe because the ride times are always short.  I totally disagree. At any park we visit, I try to ride something within 10 minutes of arriving. We need to ride a ride with a short line to boost morale and reduce kids' whining. 

**12:45 pm - 2:45 pm. ish**

Perused *Nintendo Superstar Store*. Purchased and set up Power-up bands. Photos at Mario fountain. We did not enter Super Nintendo Land. I wanted to wait for later in the day and indirect sunlight.

Ordered hot dogs from *Comet Dogs* and ate them in the little bit of shade from the trees in front of *Constellation Carousel.* Hot dogs were very average, but we only waited 10-15 minutes for our order to be filled, so that's a big plus.

**2:45 pm - 4:45 pm**

Astronomica splash pad for 30 minutes. The kids got drenched, but it was a welcome reprieve from the 92 degree heat. Changed into dry clothes at restrooms nearest Stardust racers. 

All enter Stardust racer queue. Posted wait time 35 min; in reality it was 55-ish minutes. While in queue we heard announcements about the ride having limited operations. Did rider swap, enabling the 8 year old to ride twice, back to-back with each parent. 8 year old did green side first, then yellow.

**4:45 pm - 6:55 pm**

Snack/Morale Break: *Starbucks* iced coffee, *Frosty Moon* ice cream cups with toppings. The ice cream serving was very small for the price. I don't recommend. 

We Enter *Super Nintendo Land* finally. All start playing and collecting coins, golden keys points, etc. We played the *Bowser Shadow, Jr.* game. 

  
**6:55 pm - 9:15 pm**  
Walked to Ministry of Magic. Joined *Le Cirque Arcanus* at 7:15 pm. (Line closed at 7:10 pm.) Show was very entertaining for all of us. 

7:50 Butterbeer/Morale Break at *Bar Moonshine*

8:00 p.m. Enter queue for *Battle at Ministry* \- posted wait time 60 minutes. Actual wait time not applicable...

I sent the 8 year old and my spouse into the single rider line. The 4-year-old and I went into the express pass line to use the Single Attraction Pass.  It took  13-15 minutes for both of us to arrive at the loading dock. At the very last measuring stick (we had already passed 3), the 4 year old was deemed too short to ride. I'm fine with that. Better safe than sorry.. We went to the Rider Swap area to wait for the spouse and 8 year old. Less than 5 minutes later, the ride was delayed...and delayed...and delayed.

8:53 pm cast members closed the ride and had everyone leave. 

9 pm. I got in line to replace the 2 SAPS that I had handed over to a staff member in line, but had not actually used. It took less than 10 minutes.

**In SUMMARY**\-We experienced 3 rides (and 2 of those the 8 year old was able to ride twice, so he got 5 rides technically). We also did 1 live show, 2 attractions, and about 90 minutes of game play on *Super Nintendo*. It was a good day!

Ek galti, ek samjhauta... aur shuru ho gaya ek zindagi bhar ka silsila…

Part 1: Galti Wali Pehchaan

Woh ek bilkul normal sa din tha—na koi khas umeed thi, na excitement. Main sirf ghar ke kuch kaam se local market gaya tha—thoda grocery, toothpaste, washing powder, aur ek naya shampoo jo mummy ne list mein likhwaya tha. Scooty utha ke bina plan ke nikal gaya—kya pata tha ki aaj ka din meri zindagi badal dega.

Market usual hustle-bustle se bhara tha. Log bhaag rahe the, vendors chillaa rahe the. Main apne usual general store mein ghus gaya. Aur tabhi meri nazar us par padi—white top, jeans, ponytail jismein kuch rebellious zulfein nikal rahi thi. Uske haath mein ek khaali basket thi, aur chehre pe confusion.

Main apna samaan lene laga. Tabhi uski awaaz suni:

""Bhaiya, Surf Excel kahan rakha hai? Yeh log kabhi kuch sahi se rakhte hi nahi.""

Main thoda ruk gaya. ""Bhaiya?"" Woh mujhse keh rahi thi. Main uske paas gaya aur casually bola:

""Ma’am, main yahan kaam nahi karta.""

Usne kuch seconds tak mujhe dekha, phir aankhein badi ho gayi.
""Oh god! I’m so sorry. Mujhe laga aap staff ho… pata nahi kyu.""

Main muskara diya.
""Koi nahi hota hai. Surf Excel dusre shelf pe hai.""

Woh embarrass hoke hansi.
""Thank you… aur sorry again.""

Us pal kuch click hua—shayad uski sharmili muskaan ya uski imaandaar apology. Kuch alag tha is encounter mein.

Main apna samaan lekar nikal gaya. Woh bhi checkout kar chuki thi. Jab hum dono bahar aaye, toh woh mere paas aayi.

""Actually, meri galti thi… treat toh banti hai. Free ho toh ek coffee?""
Uska tone bilkul genuine tha.

Main usually strangers se itna frank nahi hota, par kuch tha usme.
""Chalo theek hai—par agli baar staff samajhne ki galti mat karna!"" maine hasi mein kaha.


---

Part 2: Treat Se Taqraar Tak

Woh mujhe ek choti si cozy café le gayi. Coffee aur pastry order ki. Baaton ka silsila chalu hua. Pata chala woh paas ke college mein padhti hai. Friendly thi, thodi quirky, lekin calm. Uski har baat mein ek innocence thi.

Main ne jaan bujhkar uska naam nahi poocha, aur usne bhi nahi bataya. Mujhe wo mystery pasand aayi. Toh is kahani mein hum usse sirf “wo hi” kahenge.

Usne bataya shopping isliye ki kyunki mummy busy thi. Mujhe laga ki yeh normal sa din kuch ajeeb twist le raha hai.

Coffee ke baad usne thank you kaha aur hum alag ho gaye. Par jaate jaate usne kaha:

“Number exchange kar lein? Shayad dubara galti kar du.”

Aur bas, waha se chalu ho gaya ek silsila—texts, memes, mere trading ke tips, uske college ke dramas, aur meri boring office ki kahaniyaan.


---

Part 3: Jazbaat Gehre Hote Gaye

Ek din uska message aaya:
“Kuch personal baat karni hai. Aaj shaam free ho?”

Curious tha main. Mili toh bataya—ghar wale kisi rishtedaar ke ladke se rishta fix karne ki baat kar rahe the. Par uska mann nahi tha.

Main bola:
“Jo dil kahe wahi kar. Agar sahi nahi lag raha toh sahi nahi hoga.”

Woh sir hila ke boli:
“Agar aap meri jagah hote toh kya karte?”

Yeh sawaal simple nahi tha. Main muskuraya:
“Main bhi wahi karta… jo mera dil kehta.”


---

Part 4: Saath Trading, Saath Sapne

Maine use trading sikhana shuru kiya—candlestick, support-resistance, strategies. Jab woh concentrate karti, toh mujhe lagta main sirf teacher nahi, uski duniya ka ek hissa ban gaya hoon.

Ek din uska message aaya—uska pehla trade profit mein gaya tha!
""Dekha! Main bhi kar sakti hoon!"" woh khushi se chilla gayi.

Mujhe laga—yeh wahi ladki hai jo mujhe samajhti hai, jo mere life ka hissa banna chahti hai.


---

Part 5: Manali Ki Muskaan

College ke shuru hone se pehle humne plan banaya—ek choti trip Manali ki. Snow, pahad, sirf hum dono. Parents ko manana mushkil tha, par somehow ho gaya. 4-star hotel book kiya, car arrange ki. Usne pehna mustard-yellow hoodie aur blue jeans—simple yet charming.

Raaste mein woh khidki se pahadon ko dekhti rahi. Kabhi kabhi mera haath pakad leti:
""Yeh turns thoda darwate hain.""

Hotel pahuch kar staff ne balcony room diya. Dinner ke baad hum dono seedha so gaye—thak ke.

Raat 2 baje uski halke darr bhari awaaz ne jaga diya:
""Spider! Spider!""

Chhoti si makdi thi blanket par. Maine pyaar se hata diya aur bola:
""It’s okay—you’re safe.""

Woh meri kandhe par sir rakh ke boli:
""Jab tum ho, sab manageable lagta hai.""


---

Part 6: Mandir Ki Mahima

Next day mandir gaye. Pandit ji ne hume husband-wife samajh liya aur aashirwad dena start kar diya. Hum dono sharma gaye:
""Pandit ji, hum sirf friends hain.""

Woh muskara ke bole:
""Lagta toh nahi. Connection to pati-patni wala hai.""

Kuch alag mehsoos hua us pal.
Part 7: Ek Anjaani Si Tayaari

Trip ke end pe jab main usse ghar drop kar raha tha, tab pata chala ki uske relatives ghar aaye hue hain. Topic—shaadi! Hum dono shock mein the, par ek ajeeb shaanti bhi thi, jaise koi humse pehle hi yeh rishte ko pehchan chuka ho.

Manali ke baad sab kuch badal gaya. College start ho gaya, schedule tight ho gaya—par hum dono ke beech kuch aur gehra hone laga tha. Main use trading sikha raha tha, par woh meri zindagi ke har angle mein interest lene lagi thi—not just charts, par emotions tak.

Fir aaye winter holidays. Dono families ne ek combined trip plan kiya—ek spiritual trip kisi hilltop mandir pe. Destination bataya nahi gaya, bas bola gaya: “Shaant jagah hai, sab tayyar rehna.”

Waha pahuch ke cold tha, par hum dono ke chehre chamak rahe the. Aur sabse bada surprise? Mandir ke andar wohi pandit ji khade the jo Manali mein mile the!

Unhone hume dekha, muskaraaye:
“Aap dono fir se aa gaye… ab asli ashirwad lene ka time aa gaya.”

Hum jhuk ke bole:
“Abhi bhi sirf friends hain.”

Woh haan mein sir hila ke bole:
“Lagta toh nahi. Jab shaadi ho jaye, tab phir aana ek aur ashirwad lene.”

Woh moment… fir se kuch naya keh gaya.


---

Part 8: Ek Raat Jo Dil Mein Reh Gayi

Shaam ko hum hotel lot gaye. Staff ne hume pehchaan liya—aur tease karte hue bola:
“Lagta hai honeymoon ke baad wapas aaye ho!”

Hum hansi mein taal gaye, par andar se woh ek bell baj gayi—""kya hum sach mein us raaste pe hain?""

Us raat woh sky-blue nightdress mein aayi. Main simple t-shirt aur pyjama mein tha. Humne zyada kuch bola nahi—khamoshi mein sab kuch tha.

Woh balcony mein khadi thi. Main peeche se gaya, uski kamar mein haath daala. Usne resist nahi kiya. Uske baalon mein thandi hawa, aur chandni mein uska chehra—kuch toh tha us lamhe mein.

Main dheere se bola:
“Mujhe laga tum kuch aur bologi…”

Woh muskurayi:
“Kabhi-kabhi khamoshi sabse zyada keh deti hai.”

Main uske aur paas gaya:
“Jab tum paas hoti ho, sab kuch ruk jaata hai.”

Usne mera haath pakad liya—tight.

Hum swing pe baith gaye. Uska sir mere kandhe pe, meri baahon mein woh—ek narmi thi, ek warmth thi.

Woh boli:
“Dar lagta hai…”

Main pyaar se bola:
“Kis cheez ka?”

“Sab kuch khatam hone ka.”

Main uska chehra apne dono haathon mein le kar bola:
“Jab tak main hoon, kuch nahi khatam hoga.”

Uski aankhon mein aansu the, lips pe halki smile. Usne mujhe tightly hug kiya.

Hum bed pe shift ho gaye. Uska sir mere haath pe tha—bilkul Manali wali raat jaise.

Woh poori raat mujhe pakad ke soyi rahi.
Mujhe sirf yahi soch aayi—""yeh raat kabhi khatam na ho...""


---

Part 9: Subah Ka Surprise

7:30 A.M. ke aaspaas door pe knock hua. Main jaag gaya tha, woh abhi bhi so rahi thi—uska sir abhi bhi mere haath pe tha. Haath numb ho gaya tha, par dil... woh full tha.

Door khola toh dono mummiyon aur papas saamne the. Hume ek hi blanket mein dekh ke... click! Ek candid photo le li thi.

Humne aankhein kholi, unka reaction—ek muskurahat aur thoda mazaak:

“Lagta hai tum dono license le aaye ho ek dusre se chipakne ka.”

Woh takiye mein muh chhupa gayi. Main awkward sa uth gaya. Room mein hasi ka mahaul ban gaya.

Fresh ho ke breakfast ke liye gaye. Staff ne bola:
“Good morning sir & ma’am… kal raat waale moment mein aap dono bahut cute lag rahe the!”


---

Part 10: Sari Waala Scene

Woh ek peach-colored silk sari mein aayi thi—soft look, backless blouse. Pallu sambhal nahi raha tha.

Woh sharmate hue boli:
“Help kar doge?”

Main uske paas gaya, uska pallu sambhala aur shoulder pe pin kar diya.

Tabhi dono mom room mein aa gayi. Shock… phir smiles.

“Dekho toh sahi! Pati-patni waali training already shuru!”
Uski mummy boli.

“Jab pati apni patni ka pallu set karta hai na, toh usmein ek alag hi pyaar hota hai.”
Meri mummy ne bola.

Woh sharma ke dressing room mein chali gayi. Mujhe laga—ab toh sab maan chuke hain.


---

Part 11: Shaam Ki Tasdeeq

Dinner ke waqt ek family friend ne tease kiya:
“Toh shaadi kab hai? Kal toh engagement ki news mil hi jaayegi na?”

Sab hansi mein ud gaye. Hum dono ne sirf ek dusre ko dekha—aur aankhon se sab kuch keh diya.

Uske mummy-papa ne dheere se bola:
“Final maan lo.”

Us raat balcony mein khade hokar woh boli:
“Lagta hai hum apni love story ke hero-heroine ban gaye hain.”

Main uska haath pakad ke bola:
“Zindagi bhar ki story likhne ke liye tayyar ho?”

Woh chup rahi… bas mujhe hug kar liya.


---

Part 12: Jazbaat Se Judaapan

Us raat usne mujhe tightly hug kiya aur bola:
“Aaj mujhe chhodna mat… dar lag raha hai.”

Main ne usse godh mein uthaya, uske forehead pe kiss kiya. Usne aankhein band ki aur boli:
“Aaj kuch mat kehna… sirf mehsoos karwana.”

Hum ek dusre mein simat gaye—bina shabdon ke, bas jazbaaton mein.
Part 13: Ring Ceremony Ka Woh Shaam

Woh raat kuch alag hi thi. Na sirf hawa mein thandak thi, balki dilon mein bhi ek ajeeb si garmahat thi—jaise kuch bada hone wala ho. Hotel ke lawn ko soft lights se sajaya gaya tha. Choti choti fairy lights har taraf jagmag kar rahi thi, ek table center mein set thi, jahan do velvet boxes rakhe the—ek uske liye, ek mere liye.

Hum dono ke mummy-papa, kuch close rishtedaar, aur hotel ke wohi staff members jo humse emotionally jude the—sab wahaan present the. Kisi ne officially cards nahi bheje the, koi mehmaan nahi bulaaye gaye the, par fir bhi us pal mein jitni warmth thi, woh shayad ek bade hall ke shaandar event mein bhi na hoti.

Main white kurta-pajama mein tha, ekdum simple par neat. Uska choice tha, bola tha—
""Bas clean aur classic look, jaise tum ho.""

Woh apne room se jab bahar aayi... bas kuch seconds ke liye time freeze ho gaya.

Peach-pink lehenga, golden embroidery, aur halki si shimmer. Uski mummy ne specially design karwaya tha kisi boutique se. Uska dupatta uske baalon ke upar se shoulder pe gir raha tha, aur aankhon mein woh shy si smile thi, jo sidha dil ke andar tak jaati hai.

Mujhe dekh ke uski halki si aankhon ki chamak badh gayi. Woh seedha mere paas aayi, bina kuch bole—sirf aankhon se connect karte hue. Aur tabhi ek familiar awaaz ne hume aur close la diya—

“Aap dono phir mil gaye… maine toh kaha tha, agla blessing shaadi ke baad hi milega.”

Wahi Manali wale Pandit ji, iss baar ek hotel guest ke roop mein waha present the.

Unhone haath uthake hume ashirwad diya:
“Yeh sirf ek ring nahi, yeh rishta hai jo pehle se likha gaya tha. Aaj jo tum log mehsoos kar rahe ho, woh hi asli vivaah hai.”

Sab log has rahe the, par uske aur mere chehre pe sirf ek soft, emotional si smile thi. Maine uska haath pakda, uski aankhon mein dekha, aur ring uthayi.

Maine uski ungli mein woh ring pehnayi—ek perfect fit thi. Uski aankhon mein paani sa bhar gaya, par woh royi nahi—bas bole:

“Mujhe kabhi laga nahi tha yeh sab sach ban jaayega… itni jaldi.”

Main uska haath apne dono haathon mein le kar bola:
“Mujhe bhi nahi… par kabhi kabhi waqt se pehle kuch cheezein poori ho jaati hain.”

Tabhi sab clap karne lage. Usne bhi mujhe ring pehnayi. Thodi tight fit thi. Main ne bola:

“Yeh toh tight lag rahi hai…”

Woh hansi:
“Taaki bhag na paao. Pakad liya tumhe officially!”

Sab log fir se hans pade. Staff ne chai-snacks serve kiye. Soft romantic music baj raha tha.

Ek slow dance ka moment create hua. Main uske paas gaya, haath badhaya. Usne haath pakda, thoda sa sharmayi, par phir mere chest pe apna sir rakh diya. Hum halki-halki music mein hilte rahe, bina kuch kahe.

Woh dheere se boli:
“Yeh moment... mujhe freeze karna hai.”

Main uske kaan ke paas jaake bola:
“Toh chalo, zindagi bhar ke liye freeze kar lete hain.”

Uski aankhon mein aansu the—khushi ke. Us raat ka woh dance, woh lights, woh mehsoos karne waali khamoshi—sab kuch ek fairytale jaisa tha.

Uske Baad: Ek Naya Raasta

Agli subah families ne officially engagement aur shaadi ki planning shuru kar di. Cards print hone lage, venue decide hone laga. Par mere aur uske beech jo ho gaya tha... uske baad kisi official announcement ki zarurat hi nahi thi.

Sab keh rahe the—
“Yeh sirf trailer tha, picture abhi baaki hai!”

Par mujhe pata tha—picture toh tab shuru ho gayi thi, jab usne mujhe Surf Excel poocha tha aur maine kaha tha:
“Main staff nahi hoon.”
Chapter 14: Engagement Aur Shaadi – Ek Sapne Jaise Din

Shaadi se ek mahina pehle...

Ghar saj gaya tha. Har kone mein mithaas thi—rasmein, rasme-taayariyaan, aur khud hum dono. Terrace pe jahan pehle bas chaand dekha karte the, ab ek full banquet ban chuka tha. Strings lights, marigold ke phool, aur ek corner mein wohi rangoli jisme usne kabhi likha tha:

“Maybe this is fate.”

Us din main apni off-white sherwani mein tayar ho raha tha—thoda anxious, thoda excited. Mere dost mere aas-paas the, sab taang khinch rahe the:

“Bhai, ab toh tu gaya!”

Par main sirf uske baare mein soch raha tha.

Tabhi woh entry leti hai—red lehenga, golden blouse, halki si curls wale baal, aur aankhon mein kajal ka nasha. Mehendi abhi bhi uske haathon pe gehera tha. Har aankh usi par tik gayi thi.

Usne aake sirf itna kaha:

“Aaj main officially tumhari ho gayi.”

Maine halka sa muskurate hue kaha:
“Main toh pehle se hi hoon tumhara…”

Stage par hum dono ek saath the. Pandit ji ne mantra padhe, aur humne ek dusre ko phir se ring pehnayi—iss baar saari duniya ke saamne. Background mein slow flute baj raha tha, log clap kar rahe the, par mujhe sirf uski aankhein dikh rahi thi—woh aankhein jinmein main hamesha ghar dhoondhta hoon.

Cake cutting ke baad, mummy-papa ne hume gale lagaya. Uski mummy ro padi, aur maine dekha, meri maa ne bhi aankhon ka kona poncha. Emotional tha sab kuch.

Us raat terrace pe, sab lights ke beech hum dono akele khade the.

Woh boli:
“Shaadi ke do din bacha hai… darr lag raha hai.”

Main ne uska haath pakda:
“Tension mat le… tu chalegi toh main tere saath hoon. Kabhi nahi chhodunga.”

Usne sirf haan mein sir hilaaya aur mere kandhe pe sir rakh diya.

Do Din Baad – Shaadi Ka Din

Subah 6 baje se ghar mein dhol ki awaaz thi. Main golden sherwani aur red safa mein tayar ho raha tha. Heartbeat normal nahi thi. Par mann shaant tha—jaise kuch sahi hone jaa raha ho.

Tabhi mere chhote bhai ne bola:
“Bhai, woh dekho... bride ready ho gayi.”

Aur jab maine dekha... time ruk gaya.

Woh laal shaadi ka lehenga pehne, ghunghat mein, slowly mandap ki taraf aa rahi thi. Saath mein uske papa aur mummy the. Har kadam par phool gir rahe the. Saari duniya slow motion mein chali gayi thi.

Mujhe woh sab yaad aaya—shopping wali galti, Manali ka spider, balcony ki woh raat, aur woh sari ki pallu wali help...

Aur ab woh meri dulhan ban ke saamne khadi thi.

Mandap mein baithte waqt, usne haath mere haath par rakha—tight. Main uske paas jhuk kar bola:

“Tujh mein poori duniya dikhayi deti hai mujhe.”

Phere shuru hue. Har phere ke saath dil ke andar ek kasam gehri hoti gayi. Saat phere, saat vaade… har mantra mein uski muskurahat mein mera jeevan dikh raha tha.

Mangalsutra pehnaate waqt uski aankhon mein aansu aa gaye. Aur jab usne maang mein sindoor bharwaya—main bhi nahi rok paya. Woh ek pal tha jahan sab kuch sach lagne laga. Ek sapna, jise sirf hum jaante the, ab duniya ke saamne poora ho raha tha.


---

Vidaai – Sabse Mushkil Pal

Vidaai ka time... sabse emotional hota hai. Usne apni mummy ko gale lagaya, zor se ro padi:

“Main ja rahi hoon... par yahin reh jaungi, aapke dil mein.”

Uske papa ne uska matha chuma. Main thoda peeche khada tha—tab usne aankhon se mujhe bulaya.

Usne mere kandhe par sir rakha, aur main uske aasoon saaf karta raha. Mujhe laga, main uska dard chura sakta hoon.

Gaadi mein baithte waqt usne meri ungli pakdi aur sirf itna kaha:

“Promise me... kabhi chhod ke nahi jaoge?”

Main uski aankhon mein dekhta raha, aur bola:

“Ab tu meri zindagi hai… kaise chhod doon?”

Gaadi chali, phoolon ke beech se nikalte hue hum dono ek nayi journey ki taraf badh gaye—ek saath.
Chapter 15: Honeymoon in Shimla – Barf Ke Neeche Chhupi Mohabbat

Shaadi ke sirf ek din baad hum Shimla ke liye nikal gaye the. Thand ka mausam tha, par dil mein ek nayi garmi thi—ek nayi shuruaat ki. Shimla ke liye plan toh pehle hi ban gaya tha jab Manali se wapas aaye the. Usne kaha tha, “Agar kabhi honeymoon pe gaye, toh Shimla mein snowfall zaroor dekhna hai.” Aur aaj, woh khwaab bhi poora ho raha tha.


---

Shimla ka Welcome

Jaise hi hum Shimla pahunchे, safed barf se dhakaa hua sheher kisi fairytale jaisa lag raha tha. Har kone mein snowflakes, thandi hawaon mein uska dupatta udta hua, aur mere haath uske haath mein…
Kya yeh waaqai meri zindagi hai? Ya kisi film ka scene?

Hum ek wooden cottage mein rukे the—andar fireplace, aur bahar balcony se dikh raha tha poora snow-covered valley. Staff ne garam garam coffee bheji aur hum dono ek dusre ke saath cozily baithe balcony mein.

Woh boli:

“Main kabhi nahi sochi thi… ki mera honeymoon itna perfect hoga.”

Maine uska haath pakda:

“Main hoon na… perfect banaane ke liye.”

Usne sirf muskurakar aankhon se jawab diya. Woh aankhein… jo kabhi galti se mila tha, aaj meri zindagi ban chuki thi.


---

Barf Mein Masti

Agli subah, snowfall ho raha tha. Usne white sweater, blue jeans aur red muffler pehna. Main bas uski smile mein kho gaya. Hum dono ne gloves pehne aur bahar nikal gaye. Pehla snowball usne mujh par phenka:

“Ready for snow fight?”

Aur phir toh jung shuru ho gayi! Woh hans hans ke gir gayi, aur main uske paas jaakar use uthane gaya toh usne mujhe bhi kheench kar gira liya.

Ham dono snow mein lete hue, aasman ko dekh rahe the. Snow flakes uske baalon mein atak gaye the. Maine halka sa unhe hataaya. Usne aankhein band karke sirf itna kaha:

“Main sirf tumhari hoon.”

Maine use dheere se apni baahon mein le liya. Uski cheek thandi thi, lekin dil bahut garam tha.


---

Shaam Ki Roohani Shaayari

Raat mein candlelight dinner tha. Ek chhoti si table, orange light, aur slow music. Usne royal blue velvet gown pehna tha, aur main blazer mein tha. Staff ne romantic music play kiya, aur hum dono dance karne lage.

Uska sir mere seene pe tha, aur uske haathon mein mera haath. Woh whisper kar rahi thi:

“Main chahti hoon, har raat, har subah tumhare saath ho.”

Maine uske kaan ke paas jaakar kaha:

“Main tumse pehle kabhi kisi se nahi joda… kyunki mujhe pata tha, main poora sirf tumhare saath hi ho sakta hoon.”

Uski aankhon mein phir se aansu the—khushi ke.


---

Raat Ka Sukoon

Hum dono room mein wapas aaye. Usne hair open kar diye, nightdress mein aayi, ek dum simple… par itna pyaara lag rahi thi ki dil hil gaya. Fireplace ke saamne dono coffee leke baithe. Usne blanket mein pair lapet liye aur sir mere kandhe pe rakh diya.

Woh bola:

“Aaj kuch nahi kehna… sirf feel karna hai.”

Main uska haath pakadke dheere se chhati se laga liya. Uski saansen mere seene se takra rahi thi, jaise dono dil ek hi taal mein dhadak rahe ho.

Woh raat kisi ibadat se kam nahi thi.


---

Subah Ki Khushi

Agli subah jab aankh khuli, woh mere haath mein hi thi—ekdum Manali wali raat ki tarah. Par ab farq sirf yeh tha… woh officially meri patni ban chuki thi. Usne aankh khol ke sirf itna kaha:

“Main har subah tumhare haathon mein uthna chahti hoon.”

Maine uska maatha choom kar kaha:

“Har subah tera naam meri saans ban chuka hai.”

Usne zor se mujhe gale laga liya.


---

Shimla Se Ek Yaad

Humne Shimla mein aakhri din ek chhoti si diary khareedi. Usne likha:

> “Shimla mein snowfall se zyada tumhari baahon ka sukoon mila. Ye honeymoon nahi… meri zindagi ki sabse safe jagah thi—tumhaari baahon mein.”



Aur main ne likha:

> “Galti se mila tha… par ab tum meri sabse sahi galti ban chuki ho.”

Chapter 16: Mandir Wapsi – Humari Shaadi Ka Aashirvaad

Shimla se wapas aate waqt road par barf ke thande tukde abhi bhi bikhre hue the, par humare dil mein ek ajeeb si garmi thi—sukoon ki, pyaar ki, aur ek complete hone wali journey ki. Honeymoon ke woh kuch din kisi sapne se kam nahi the, par ab ek last stop bacha tha… woh mandir, jahan se sab kuch shuru hua tha.


---

Ek Vaada Jo Nibhana Tha

Car mein baithe woh bahar ke view ko dekh rahi thi, aankhon mein ek narmi thi, aur lips pe ek pyaari si muskaan. Main driving seat par tha, lekin dil uski taraf hi tha. Usne dheere se kaha:

“Yaad hai pandit ji ne kya bola tha? Jab shaadi ho jaaye, tab wapas aana… blessing lena.”

Main muskuraya:
“Aur tumne kaha tha, agar hum wapas gaye… toh pati-patni ban kar hi jaayenge. Dekho, aaj sach ho gaya.”

Usne sirf haan mein sir hilaya, aur mera haath pakad liya. Woh haath jo pehle galti se Surf Excel poochh raha tha… aaj uska pati ban kar uska haath thaam raha tha. Zindagi kab kahan se kahan le jaati hai, pata bhi nahi chalta.


---

Mandir Ka Wo Pehla Nazar

Jab hum mandir ke paas pahuche, toh wohi ghanti ki awaaz, wohi chadhai, aur wohi shaanti wali hawa. Lekin is baar hum haathon mein haath lekar ussi raaste se guzar rahe the, jahan pehle bas do dosti ka naata tha. Aaj woh dosti… saath pheron mein badal chuki thi.

Mandir ke gate pe khade hi the ki pandit ji ne pehchaan liya. Woh same muskaan, wohi energy:

“Aagaye aap dono? Maine toh kaha tha… shaadi kar ke hi lautoge.”

Woh jhuk gayi, pair chhoo kar ashirwad liya. Main bhi uske saath. Pandit ji ne hum dono ke sir pe haath rakha:

“Aaj tum dono ki bandhan sirf zameeni nahi… aatmaon ka milan hai. Yahan jitne bhi jode aaye hain, sabhi ne sukh paaya. Tumhara bandhan bhi kabhi kamzor nahi hoga.”


---

Aarti Mein Ek Saath

Mandir mein aarti shuru hui, aur hum dono ne ek hi thaali pakdi. Usne mera haath thaam ke diya ghumaya. Us waqt mujhe sirf ek hi baat mehsoos hui—

""Is se zyada pavitra rishta ho hi nahi sakta.""

Mandir ke prangan mein ghanti bajti rahi, aur hum dono aankhen band karke woh aashirwad lete rahe, jiske liye shayad humara milna likha gaya tha.


---

Mandir Ke Baad Wohi Jhoola

Mandir ke baahar ek chhota sa jhoola tha—wahi jahan hum pehli baar Manali se laut kar baith gaye the. Main fir se usse le gaya wahan. Usne kaha:

“Tumhe yaad hai na… pehli baar jab tumne mujhe yeh jhoolay par bithaya tha?”

Main bola:

“Tab main sochta tha… kahin yeh sapna toh nahi. Par aaj tum mere haathon mein ho, meri patni banke. Sapna toh nahi, par tum ho meri zindagi ka sabse haseen hissa.”

Usne mere kandhe pe sir rakha, aur hum dono us jhoolay pe usi tarah baith gaye jaise us din. Farq sirf yeh tha… pehle anjaane the, aaj apne the.


---

Chhoti Si Pooja – Ek Naya Sankalp

Pandit ji ne hume ek chhoti si pooja ke liye roka. Usne ek sindoor ki dibbi aur mangalsutra la kar diya.

“Phir se ek baar is mandir mein, ek baar phir tum use patni sweekar karo. Yeh sirf yaad bankar nahi rehna chahiye—yeh mandir tumhare rishte ki misaal ban jaye.”

Main ne uske maang mein sindoor bhara… us baar ki tarah nahi, is baar poore vishwas, pyaar aur samarpan ke saath.

Uske aankhon mein aansu aa gaye, par is baar khushi ke the.

“Ek hi galti thi meri zindagi ki… par wohi meri sabse badi saans ban gayi,” maine kaha.

Usne kaha:

“Tum jaise ho, waise hi perfect ho. Tumhe paake lagta hai, meri zindagi ne finally breathe lena seekha hai.”


---

Mandir Se Wapsi – Ek Saath Jeevan Ki Shuruaat

Mandir se nikalte waqt usne phir se ek baar piche mur kar dekha.

“Jab bhi hum kisi musibat mein honge… ya kuch bhi uljhan ho… yahin laut aayenge. Kyunki yeh mandir sirf ek jagah nahi… yeh toh humari kahani ka asli mod hai.”

Main bola:

“Wapas zaroor aayenge… lekin agla chapter tab hoga jab humare bachche saath honge, aur woh poochein—‘Mummy-papa ki love story kaha se shuru hui thi?’”

Usne sharma ke sir jhuka liya, par muskaan uske gaalon pe chamak rahi thi.


---

Yeh Tha Mandir Ka Safar – Ek Circle Complete

Zindagi ne jahan se mod liya tha, aaj humne wapas wahi se ek naya mod shuru kiya.

Mandir ke ghante ki woh goonj, uske saath li gayi woh dua, aur uski maang mein bhara hua sindoor—sab kuch perfect tha.

Ek galti se mila tha pyaar… par us pyaar ka aashirwad aaj swarg se kam nahi tha.
📖 Chapter 17: Ghar Wapsi – Jahan Har Rasam Mein Uska Naam Tha

Shimla ki barf se bhari raatein, fireplace ke saamne ki woh coffee wali baatein, aur balcony mein moonlight ke neeche uski baahon mein simat jana — sab kuch ab ek yaadon ka hissa ban chuka tha. Honeymoon officially khatam ho gaya tha, lekin rishta abhi naya tha — har pal mein ek naye ehsaas ki khushboo thi.

Taxi highway par thi. She was resting her head on my shoulder, aankhen band thi, par ek halka sa smile uske hothon par tha. Jaise keh rahi ho:

""Ghar ja rahe hain, lekin pehli baar kisi ke saath apna ghar lag raha hai.""

Main uski maang mein sindoor ko dekh raha tha, har baar wahi thought aata —
“Yeh ladki ab meri zindagi hai… literally.”

🏠 Ghar Ka Darwaza – Swagat Ek Naye Rishtay Ka

Ghar ka darwaza khula. Mummy, papa, aur uske maa-baap dono taraf diya jala ke khade the. Aangan mein toran latak raha tha, jisme phoolon ki khushboo thi.

Mummy ne aarti ki, aur uske pair doodh aur roli se thali mein rakhaaye. Usne sharma ke ek nazar mujhe dekha — usme sab kuch tha: sharm, pyaar, naya rishta aur ek asmanjas bhi.

“Andar aao, ghar tumhara intezaar kar raha hai,” mummy ne kaha.


---

🍲 Uski Pehli Rasoi – Ek Mithaas Bhari Subah

Agli subah pehli rasoi thi. Kitchen mein pehli baar usne apron pehna. Uske haathon mein mehendi ab bhi dikh rahi thi, aur aankhon mein halka sa dar — kya sabko pasand aayega?

""Kya bana rahi ho?"" maine pucha.

""Kheer… pehli rasoi mein sab kuch meetha hi hona chahiye na,"" usne muskarate hue kaha.

Maine uske piche se jaa ke haath pakda —
""Tera haath ho, to sab kuch meetha lagta hai.""

Kheer bani, sab ne taste kiya. Papa ne bola:
""Beta, isse kheer banana nahi, khushiyan pakana aata hai.""

Mummy ki aankhon mein aansu the — khushi wale.


---

👩‍👩‍👦‍👦 Family Bonding – Wo Sabka Dil Jeet Gayi

Uske nature mein kuch tha — ek simplicity, ek garmahat, jo sabke dil ko chhoo jaata. Do din ke andar hi wo papa ke saath cricket dekhne lagi, mummy ke saath shopping list banane lagi, aur mere chhote bhai ko padhai ke tips dene lagi.

Har jagah ek hi naam ghoom raha tha — ""Hamari bahu.""

Rishtedaar aaye, padosi aaye, sabne use dekha aur bola:
""Tumhare chehre pe itna noor hai… aur tumhara toh glow alag hi hai!""

Aur main… main bas door se use observe karta tha.
Har baar jab wo mujhe dekhti aur halka sa muskurati — dil ke andar ek awaaz aati:

“Yeh sach mein meri hai.”


---

🛏️ Raat Mein Ek Sukoon Bhari Baatein

Us raat hum dono apne kamre mein the. She changed into a cotton night suit, tied her hair loosely, and just curled up beside me.

""Thak gayi ho?"" maine pucha.

""Nahi… par har ek rasam mein apna naam sunna, ek naya ehsaas tha…""

Main uske paas gaya, uske kaan ke paas halka sa kaha:

""Ab zindagi ke har scene mein tumhara hi naam hoga.""

Usne meri taraf dekha, aankhon mein halke se aansu the — pyaar ke.

""Dar lagta hai… kahin sab khatam na ho jaaye.""

Maine uska haath pakda, apne seene par rakha:
""Yahan rakho… jab tak ye dhadak raha hai, tum yahin rahogi.""

Usne mujhe jaddoo ki jhappi di, aur woh raat — kuch keh ke nahi, bas ek doosre ko mehsoos kar ke guzri.


---

📿 Naye Naam Ki Pehli Pukar

Agli subah, uske phone par ek message aaya:

📲 ""Mrs. Sharma, your bank appointment is confirmed.""
(Uska surname ab change ho chuka tha.)

Wo message usne mujhe dikhaya.
""Lagta hai duniya bhi accept kar chuki hai ab.""

Main hans diya, aur kaha:
""Jab dil ne kab ka kiya tha, toh duniya kya cheez hai.""


---

🔔 Chapter 17 Ends… Par Dil Mein Ek Aaram Sa Hai

Ghar aakar rishta zyada real lagta hai. Rasmein, logon ke reactions, uska naam, uski pehli rasoi, uski presence — sab kuch ek nayi kahani likh raha tha.

Jab pyaar shaadi ban jaaye, aur shaadi ek sukoon ka ghar, tabhi kahani asli lagti hai.

1lykdi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1lykdi3/reese_says_she_feels_closer_to_god_as_she_and/,Reese says she feels closer to God as she and fans push her Zoom calls,"Reese is live at the hotel with some of her fans from the Nashville meet-up. She shows off a jumpsuit she got today. She says she tried on a different jumpsuit as well and she would rather have a Pap smear than do that again because it separated her flaps in a painful way. A fan says the only thing Reese has bought for herself all weekend is her own coffee. People have been showering her with presents, help and attention.  
  
Reese says she was trying on a lot of clothes today and she had no pants so she came out of her dressing room multiple times wearing just her underwear and a top. As Reese is discussing her flaps, one of her fans says ""Oh, Reese."" That's how Reese's mom responds when she's embarrassed, Reese says. Her mom and her stepdad came to meet her fans today. ""That was really special,"" she says. Reese's fans also got to meet her elderly dog, Gertie.   
  
She says the bartender nearby is the loudest person she's ever heard in her life. ""It angers me when people are that loud,"" Reese says, raising her voice. ""It makes me want to do it back. We can do it too."" When Reese was still married to Jeff, she did a stream in Nashville and kept flirting with one of the hotel employees. He kissed her and then she made a big deal that she was extremely uncomfortable. Reese later admitted to her fans that she lied to them about why she took that trip to Nashville.   
  
Reese is drinking a Shirley Temple and says she's hungry. ""I need help. Can you carry my gift? I forgot that I had two bags here,"" she tells one of her fans. The fan jumps into action and Reese starts walking, showing her audience the hotel pool. ""This has been so much more than I expected,"" she says.   
  
Another fan agrees, saying that the women who came are just as real and just as fantastic as people think they are from Reese's chat, Facebook group and Zoom calls. ""It's been so deeply connecting,"" Reese says. The fan says it took a lot of effort to put the meet-up together. Reese didn't do any of that work. The fans did.

Reese's Bible superchatter pays to send three separate verses for Reese and the group. Reese says a lot more people say they're going to join her Zoom calls now because they had no idea about the camaraderie there. Dozens of people pay Reese $25 or $50 a month to be in monthly marathon Zoom calls. She spills secrets there that she doesn't share on her livestreams and says she lets each fan on those calls talk for as long as they want to talk.   
  
There have been little annoyances among people at the meet-up, the fan says, but she's not leaving until Monday and she already doesn't want to leave. Reese is talking about doing similar meet-ups in different cities. I'm sure she is now that this group of fans has showered her with presents, including the $1,400 peace sign she's been sadfishing nine months to get.   
  
Reese sees a man nearby and sneers that he has a chain around his neck.   
  
One fan drove 13 hours to be at this meet-up.   
  
Another channel member tells Reese she can't superchat Bible verses, but she will keep posting them. She seems jealous of the extra attention and love that Reese gives to the superchatter.   
  
Reese admits tonight that she does share things on her Zoom calls that she would never share on YouTube. When other fans who can't afford those calls get the fear of missing out, Reese has often sworn to them that she doesn't do anything different in the Zoom calls, but that's not true. She has started to push those Zoom calls more and more as her subscriber numbers and views have been dropping.   
  
Apparently one fan bought that expensive peace sign for Reese herself and then had everyone sign the back of it. That same fan bought Reese another gift at Southern Goods.   
  
Reese says she feels closer to God than she's ever felt. ""This is such a God thing. This whole channel,"" she says.

The fan who has been talking about how great this meet-up is says that a lot of Reese's Zoom callers are isolated in their own lives and that she's walking away from this weekend with lifelong friends. This is the same fan who told Reese not long ago that Tommy scammed her out of money under the guise that he needed to visit Reese when they were already broken up. She says the fans are celebrating each other this weekend, not just Reese.   
  
The group is having brunch tomorrow. Reese confirms that the fans have spoiled her rotten this weekend, bringing her gifts as well as buying things for her when she said she was thinking about getting something for herself. They've also paid for her meals.   
  
She claims that the birthday cake her fans gave her today was the first birthday cake she's had as an adult. Reese says she thinks she has one photo of a birthday cake she got when she turned 5, but she has no memory of it. ""I've never once had a birthday cake. Never,"" she says. Reese says stuff like that sometimes and then later admits that her mom and stepdad have a long tradition of taking her out for steak on her birthday.   
  
""I feel very close to God lately and I think you have a lot to do with that,"" Reese tellls her Bible superchatter after she gets paid to read yet another verse before ending the stream.

Some people in Reese's chat are wishing that they could be there and are disappointed that there have only been two short streams from this meet-up. A Zoom caller had said she would do some streaming, but she didn't. Reese says she and her fans have been so busy connecting with each other in person that they just haven't had much time to stream or take pictures to share with her channel.

Currently 37 & I've been seeing all my Dr.s about looking to get pregnant soon, & my beloved Reproductive Endocrinologist (for hypothyroidism) & brand new OB/GYN both want me either off Bupropion or decreased as much as possible. My primary Dr. had been handling my Bupropion refills for the past few years since my old psychiatrist switched practices, just as we were beginning to explore a possible ADD diagnosis.

A few weeks ago, my brand new psychiatrist said at very first that Bupropion is 100% safe for use during pregnancy, & was confused why I was concerned. I explained what my other doctors said, but left it with, ""Well I dunno, that's just what they told me,"" not bothering to mention how I had obviously looked it up myself as well, & found that it increases the possibility of heart defects.

She looked it up on the spot, and suddenly agreed that yes, we need to get you off this. Given the rest, that also looks like a red flag now.

[Luckily, I was in a verrry good i-want-baby mood, cuz otherwise I do NOT want to change this at all. But, for baby, I will... while I must... That is, *IF* I even *can*...]

She only asked me like 5 ranked intake questions, & said I'm ""actually not clinically depressed,"" although at least she did seem to acknowledge that it's the Bupropion keeping me stable. Still, I count that as a red flag.

I asked about trying other NDRIs, & she said no, that Sertraline is the absolute safest, that SSRIs are better for depression, &, in regards to mentioning the old ADD avenue, she said no, ""Let's have you a healthy baby *first,* and *then* later on down the line, maybe we can revisit that."" Again, all red flags to me.

Also, I told her, I've already had bad reactions to Citalopram (SSRI; before any Bupropion Rx; 1 full month on it & it did nothing for me except sexual dysfunction) and Duloxetine (SNRI; in the midst of bupropion, simply looking to switch cuz of constipation & shakey hands. I can't even describe how my brain itself immediately malfunctioned. That was the first & last day.). Still...

**She prescribed me 25mg of Sertraline & 75mg of Bupropion, down from my 150mg XL. I asked how I should go about switching, & she said I should switch immediately.**

I had to wait a week til an e. coli infection cleared & I finished the antibiotics, but otherwise... I also just had a really bad feeling about this all.

Sunday was my last round of antibiotics.

Monday I took my 100mcg Levothyroxine at 6am, then waited 4 hours to even eat anything, as my absorption had been in question last year. 

10am, I cut the Sertraline in ½. So it was actually only about 12mg. I took that, & absolutely nothing else. No Bupropion, No vitamins, No caffiene. Just my breakfast of overnight oats & lots of water.

My heart immediately started racing. I laid down, trying to remain calm, drinking lots more water. I couldn't keep any part of me still, I was so fidgety, & anxious, especially knowing this was a *reaction*. That lasted til about 12:30pm. Then, I got hit with a wave of sleepiness. I conked out til about 3pm. I spent the rest of the day laying down, in and out of napping, & just so overwhelmingly tired & heavy. But suddenly, around 11pm, my heart was racing again, & I was fidgety again, keeping my poor husband awake til he finally passed out by *4am*, & I finally, FINALLY, fell asleep around ***5am.***

I at least remembered to turn my 6am Levo alarm OFF. 😩

Tuesday I only took my Levo, around 10am itself actually, but nothing else, again. Luckily, I felt okay.

Wednesday, Levo was around 8:30am, as I had to try to fix my sleep. Again, no Bupropion, no caffiene, just vitamins, & again felt okay, just sleepier earlier in the evening than usual, but that makes sense.

Thursday, I had my Levo around 7:30am, then later cracked open that 75mg Bupropion, & vitamins, but still no caffiene. Good again for the day.

Friday, Levo, 75mg Bupropion, vitamins, & actually had a small cup of coffee again. Fine for the day.

Saturday, same as Friday, fine.

I am now dreeeading calling this psychiatrist on Monday now. I know I was reluctant to try another SSRI, but she wanted me to ""give it a try"" with 25mg Sertraline AND 75mg Bupropion for a whole month before I wrote it off. But my heart couldn't handle 12mg Sertraline by itself for even an hour!

***Isn't that a textbook Serotonin Syndrome reaction???***

This is the 3rd serotonin-based med now to not help me. I think it's safe to say my issue is not serotonin.

I wasn't turning down the street I grew up on. I wasn't standing near the large oak in the front yard of the house where I'd lost all my baby teeth. I wasn't sitting inside the kitchen, where, on my fifteenth birthday, I accidentally dropped the cake my mom had baked, which made my family laugh so hard that we shed tears. No. I was holding an oil painting at a Goodwill on the other side of the country.

""That can't be possible,"" my husband said.

""It can be possible, Parker, because I'm holding the flipping painting and telling you.""

""One, language. Two, can I say something without you jumping down my throat?"" Parker asked, his voice even.

""Yes,"" I said.

""Is there an outside chance that this just looks like your childhood home? I mean, you grew up in the burbs. A lot of cookie-cutter homes, no?""

I hated to admit he had a point. But as I stared at the house, I couldn't come around to that line of thinking. This was my house. Hell, the roses in the flower beds were the same size and color as I remembered them. ""No. I mean, I hear you and you're not off base. But, dude, this is my house."" I pointed at the porch. ""I broke that railing trying to do a ballet spin and fell into the bushes.""

""You? Miss Two Left Feet? Senorita Trips-a-lot? Tried to do a ballet spin?""

""To be fair, I did the spin. I just didn't stick the landing.""

""A minor detail in the world of dance. The landing part.""

""I landed…on the bushes right here,"" I said, pointing to the painting. ""Hold on, I have to send a photo to my mom.""

""Does she have old house photos?""

""Of course she does. You've met her, right?""

I had Parker hold the painting and snapped a few pictures. I sent them over to Mom and asked if she had a photo to compare it to. The message came back a minute later. ""OMG! That's our house! Weird."" Another ding brought us a house photo. It looked exactly like the artwork in my hand.

I showed Parker. ""Christ,"" he said. ""That's it.""

""Told you.""

""That's wild. Is it a print or a real painting?""

I ran my hand across the art. There was a palpable texture to the brush strokes. Sometimes, a print may have varnish applied to give the impression of brushstrokes. This wasn't that. ""I think this is real, but let me check something else,"" I said, walking toward the wall of ugly lamps.

I turned on a lamp and held the painting in front of the bulb. Some artists will draw the picture first in pencil before painting. Sometimes, you can see those marks when you hold it up to the light. Staring at the oak tree in the painting, I saw graphite streaks underneath.

""It's real,"" I declared.

""Who painted it?""

A slash of red paint in the corner mimicked a signature, but Parker and I stared at it as if it were written in Minoan Linear A. Parker traced the paint with his finger. Forwards and backwards. ""The first name may be George or Jeff? I think George. Look at how it flows."" He retraced the letters, and it made sense to me.

""Okay, what's the last name?""

""Hell if I know.""

I tried Parker's finger tracing. It felt like I was tracing a line drawing by someone with too much caffeine in their system. These didn't seem like actual letters.

""Might be Moffit,"" a soft voice said from behind us.

We turned and saw that a Goodwill employee had materialized. She was a short, frail-looking elderly woman with a hairstyle that resembled a well-constructed cumulus cloud in both color and shape.

""Moffit?"" I said.

""I think that's an 'm',"" she said, pointing to two humps. ""Then it kind of circles into an 'o' and the double fs. The 'I' and the 't' are somewhat stylized, I think. Artists being artists.""

I looked and, yeah, it kinda looked like Moffit. ""I can see it. George Moffit, you think?""

""I do. Beautiful piece. Don't you think?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""It looks exactly like the house I grew up in."" I showed her the photo my mom sent.

""How strange!""

""Right? I grew up across the country. Why is this even here?""

""When I was younger, there was a company that would paint your home for you.""

""Painters?"" Parker deadpanned.

""Ignore him,"" I said. ""He doesn't know how to act in public.""

She laughed. ""I understand. I have one just like him at home. That's why he's at home.""

I laughed. ""You're teaching and I'm taking notes, ma'am.""

""Anyway, they would come paint portraits of your house. It was a thing for a few years. This looks like one of those. There may be a company name on the back, under the frame.""

I flipped the painting over and gingerly removed the frame. Sure enough, there was a small, faded sticker that read ""Cozy Home Portraits Company."" There wasn't any other information. I made an impressed noise. ""Look at that. Have a jumping off point to find out what this is all about. Thank you so much….""

""Marge.""

""Marge, thank you. Sorry again for this guy.""

""Marge, please forgive me. You're a gentlewoman and a scholar.""

Marge leaned into him and nodded at me. ""You're punching above your weight with her, kiddo. Keep her happy.""

Parker laughed, wrapped his arm around my hip, and pulled me in for a hug. ""Marge, that's the best advice I've ever received from a Goodwill employee.""

""If only your barber had given you good advice. You could've avoided that haircut.""

I burst out laughing. Parker did too. ""Marge, I hope to grow up to be just like you.""

""You found a guy who can take a joke. That's a start. You guys wanna get that or still debating?""

I looked at Parker, and he nodded. ""How can we not get this? Even if it's just for the story.""

Marge smiled. ""See, you can learn. Come on, kids. I'll ring you up.""

When I got home, I immediately began researching the Cozy Home Portraits Company. I had a hard time finding anything. Most of the search results were links to people on Reddit asking the same questions. Apparently, there were a lot of folks like me who were surprised to find their childhood homes immortalized on canvas. One commenter said something that stuck with me.

""Parker, listen to this,"" I said, reading the post. ""My mom says she remembers someone approaching her and asking if they could take a photo so they could paint the house later. She told them no at first, but they said they'd do it for no cost. Mom agreed and assumed she'd get the painting at some point, but she never heard from the company again.""

""What's the next commenter say?""

""This sounds fake,"" I read. ""Kind of a dickish response, no?""

""It's Reddit,"" he said, shrugging. ""Maybe they just used the houses for inspiration and sold the paintings to commercial houses for reproductions?""

""Then why bother involving the homeowners at all?""

""Maybe to assuage their worries of someone standing outside their home snapping photos of their house?"" Parker suggested.

""I mean, anyone could take a photo of our house, and I'd have no idea unless I saw them do it.""

""True. It's weird, I'll grant you, but I think I'm on the right track. Commercial art. Americana stuff. That was to be it.""

He may have been onto something, but that answer didn't feel right. I couldn't work out the logic. If this company had been around for a while and painted portraits of homes all across the country for commercial sale, why wasn't there any record of them? No stories online. No official business records. No known CEO or lists of artists or anyone. Hell, even searching for the name George Moffit didn't yield results.

My mind told me there was something off about this. A sense of dread loomed over the whole thing. I let it marinate all day to see if I'd reconsider. Shocking no one, I didn't. I told Parker as much as we got ready for bed.

""You're reacting that way because of what's happening in the world right now,"" Parker said, yawning. ""There are real evil people out there, but they aren't painting pictures.""

""Hitler painted pictures,"" I said.

He gave me a deadpan stare. ""You know what I mean.""

""I just can't let it go. It's odd. Odd that it was done at all. Odd that it traveled all the way out here. Odd that I found it. Odd stacked on odd stack on odd.""

""Turtles all the way down.""

""What?"" I said, crinkling up my face. ""What do turtles have to do with anything?""

He laughed. ""Nothing. Just a dumb expression."" He yawned again. ""Why is this bothering you so much?""

""Some random company painted and sold pictures of my childhood house with no one knowing about it. It's….""

""Odd,"" he said with a smile.

""Very. It's just not sitting right with me.""

Parker yawned for a third time. ""My melatonin is kicking in here. Get some rest and see how you feel in the morning. Maybe call your mom, see if she has a story to tell. She might know something.""

He didn't wait for my response. Instead, he rolled over, shut off the lamp, and turned on our sound machine. As digital thunderstorms rolled into our bedroom, I lay down on my pillows but didn't fall asleep. This whole thing smothered my thoughts as much as my weighted blanket did my body.

I would call Mom tomorrow. See what she knew. If anything. I heard light snores coming from Parker's direction and sighed. That man could fall asleep even if the house were on fire. I flipped on YouTube, found something to help me sleep, and closed my eyes.

Or would have, if I hadn't seen our front porch light turn on.

A cold touched my brain and froze the rest of my body. The light going off didn't mean a prowler was trying to jimmy open our lock. It could be a bug flying too close to the sensor or a sleepwalking squirrel. Improbable? Sure, but they were better than the alternative. I didn't want to wake Parker, but I also wasn't keen on investigating alone.

While I was debating getting out of bed, I heard a noise in the kitchen. That made the decision easy. I elbowed Parker. ""What?"" he asked, his voice a blend of exhaustion and annoyance.

""Our front porch light went off,"" I whispered.

""Raccoons tripping the light,"" he said. ""Not worth waking me.""

""I know, but…but I heard someone in the kitchen.""

His eyes zinged open. In a flash, he was on his feet and grabbed the bat we kept near the bed. He quietly inched along the wall until he got to the bedroom doorway. He peeked out and scanned the room before turning back to me and shrugging.

I pointed to the kitchen again before popping up and joining him on the wall. Parker wasn't pleased. He told me, not in words but vigorous nods, to go back to the bed and wait. I didn't. He gave in, and we made our way out of the bedroom. Me walking directly behind him like some backwards waltz.

I saw nothing. That went double after Parker slammed his hand on the switch, flooding the room with light and damn near blinding me in the process. I let out a painful yelp and covered my eyes to adjust. I heard Parker sigh.

""We're good,"" he said. ""Nothing in here.""

""You gotta tell me before you do that,"" I said, finally checking out the room. Everything initially looked washed out. ""I'm nearly blind.""

""I wanted the element of surprise,"" Parker said.

""You achieved it,"" I said. ""All I see now are a bunch of little diamonds everywhere.""

He walked into the kitchen. ""Your intruder is nothing more than a fallen salt shaker,"" he said, holding up the culprit.

""Oh.""

""Like I said, a raccoon probably tripped the light. I'm going back to sleep. You should, too.""

He walked past me, patted my ass, and headed back to bed. I was about to join him when my eyes landed on the painting. I walked over to it and stared. In the store, looking at it had flooded my emotions with joy and happiness. But now? None of that.

Unease seeped into my blood and rushed through my body. Something was different about the painting. I couldn't put my finger on what had changed, but I knew something had. It was giving me chills. I grabbed a nearby napkin and draped it over the artwork like a coroner covering a dead body. My thinking was that if there was something supernatural about this thing, the napkin would keep it at bay.

Dumb, I know, but it made sense at the time.

""I couldn't believe that picture. That's so wild."" Mom was too chipper for this early in the morning. She always was, though. A real 'rise with the early bird' kind of gal.

That wasn't me. I still had bedhead as I sipped my cup of coffee. Parker, another early riser, cooked breakfast. ""I thought so too. Someone told me a company used to go around and paint pictures of homes. They'd ask the homeowners beforehand. Any memory of that?""

""Not that I can remember. Back then, it was mostly your father who spoke with salesmen. I found them unseemly. I can't imagine he'd allow someone to do that, rest his soul.""

""Yeah. Dad was pretty private.""

""We had a neighbor who was a painter, though. Carl, no, that wasn't it. Craig! Craig…aww goddamn my ancient brain. Bonnie, don't get old. It's hell.""

""I'm trying not to. It's why I do my nightly skincare routine.""

""It's intense,"" Parker added with a smirk.

""What was his name? It's been years since I thought of him. Craig…Morris? Something like that. He didn't live near us for long. Dad didn't like him. At all.""

""Why?""

""Craig was the human equivalent of a popcorn kernel stuck in your teeth. Irritating. He rubbed your father the wrong way.""

""I don't remember Dad talking about him.""

""He didn't around you, but with me, hoo boy. Craig used to walk by the house all the time, always whistling 'pop goes the weasel' for some reason. He'd stand too close when he talked to you. He'd leer at me when I was outside hanging laundry on the line. He'd never get the hint that I wanted to be left alone, even though I was always short with him. Especially after he said that you were growing up nicely.""

""Gross,"" I said. ""I was ten.""

""Like I said, he was a weirdo. But, again, most artiste types are, I suppose. Remember your Uncle Walter? Made those ghastly papier mache skulls. They used to be all over his house. Was like walking into some cannibal's hut whenever we'd go over there. But he was good at making them. Who'd want them is another thing altogether. He gave us one, and I made your dad keep it in a bag in the garage. 'Don't bring that ghoulish shit in my house.'""

As my mom rambled about skull shapes like a Victorian phrenologist, a thought came to me. I looked down at the painting and traced the painter's name. ""Mom, could his name have been Craig Moffit?""

Parker looked over at me. I nodded down at the painting and traced what I thought the letters were with my finger. He hit his forehead with the spatula and shook his head.

""OH MY GOD! Yes! That was it! Craig Moffit. God, what a blast from the past. He really was a weird little freak of a man,"" my mom said, laughing. ""He used to wear these tiny little shorts, and he did *not* have the legs for it. Looked like two toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Mom droned on a little longer, but provided nothing of substance beyond Craig Moffit's horrid legs. But she'd given me some new information - the artist's real name. As soon as I hung up, I grabbed my laptop.

""Craig Moffit! Not George! Craig!""

""I see it now,"" Parker said. ""We should've never trusted Marge. Didn't like the cut of her jib.""

""Babe, her jib was flawless,"" I said, turning to the painting. ""Her eyes, not so much.""

""To be fair, we all agreed it was George Moffit….""

""There! There's Craig Moffit!"" I turned the computer around and showed a webpage dedicated to his art. Parker leaned down to get a closer look.

""His legs do look like toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Rolling my eyes, I turned the laptop back to me and clicked on the man's ""About Me"" page. It was illuminating. Craig had quite the little career. He'd worked for a few newspaper outlets. A few magazines. Some ad campaigns. His stuff was good. There was a list of known works.

""There are a few house paintings listed here. It has to be him.""

""Has anyone mentioned how odd this is?"" Parker said with a sly smile.

""It's catching on.""

""Maybe he saw your home as a happy family home and wanted to capture it for that company. Is there a contact page?""

""There is!"" I yelped. I read the page out loud. ""If you have questions about Craig or his work, please feel free to reach out here,"" I said.

""That's great. You can email him and ask directly.""

""Moffit estate at Moffit art dot com,"" I read. ""Shit. He's dead.""

""That shouldn't matter. Maybe the guy who runs the estate can answer your questions?""

I nodded. It was worth a shot. I started composing a message, and Parker went back to breakfast. I glanced at the artwork on the table next to me. Something about it picked at my brain.

""Hey, I meant to ask, have you been watching professional Wiffle ball games on our YouTube?""

""Oh, yeah. I've started turning on games after your melatonin kicks in. Puts me right out.""

""Uh-huh. Are you a Wiffle ball fan?""

""No,"" I said, laughing. ""I just happened across it one night, and I fell asleep like ten minutes into a game. It's better than ocean waves. Which game was it?""

""Umm, Rhinos against the….""

""Storks? Oh man, those two teams hate each other. Storks have won the last three series behind Dustin Braddock's nasty banana ball…."" I stopped speaking because I could feel Parker's smug smirk on his face. I looked up and caught it with my own eyes. ""Not a fan.""

""What the hell is a banana ball?""

PING!

""They emailed back already,"" I said. ""What the hell?""

""Maybe there isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate?""

""Hi, Craig Moffit was my father. He did several pieces of local homes during that era. I would love to discuss this with you. Can we set up a call?""

""So there clearly isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate,"" Parker said.

""I'm going to say yes. I think I have to, if for no other reason than my own sanity.""

""Go for it. I can be there for the call if you need me.""

So I set up a call with the estate for later that day. Hopefully, there'd be some information that I could use to stop the itch in my brain. Parker served me breakfast before he got ready to head out to the gym.

""You never told me what a banana ball is,"" he said, placing the plate in front of me.

""It's a side arm slurve. A strikeout pitch. Nearly unhittable if Braddock is on his game."" Parker gave me a quizzical look. I sighed. ""Not a fan.""

After Parker had left for the gym, I went back over to the painting. It was still sitting in the last place I had left it. Still had the napkin over it. The bad vibes I felt earlier were still there. In fact, they'd grown worse. I didn't even want this thing in my house anymore - covered or not.

Despite my misgivings, I pulled the napkin off the painting and gave it a once-over. I felt my stomach gurgle, and my throat went dry. Looking at this now literally caused physical pain. It didn't make sense.

""Where's the front door?"" I suddenly asked myself out loud.

The front door of the house was gone. Blacked out like an actor with perfect teeth coloring in one to look sufficiently destitute for a role. I scraped where the door had been with my thumb. No fresh paint. It was like it had always been that way. But it hadn't. I checked the photo I sent to my mom to confirm.

""What in the….""

There was a creak on the basement stairs. There very much shouldn't have been a creak on the basement stairs. The basement was home to nothing but dust, Christmas decorations, and my ugly childhood couches we didn't have the heart to throw away. Since none of those things can walk, this made no sense.

I tiptoed to the knife block and pulled out a butcher knife. With my phone in my free hand, I used my nimble thumb to unlock it. I was ready to dial 911. But, as I stared at my reflection in the knife blade, I questioned whether I was prepared to stick it into another person. I wouldn't know that until it came to that moment. I very much prayed that wouldn't happen.

Another creak. Near the top of the stairs now. It was getting closer. I flexed the grip on the knife. I tried to control my breathing, but couldn't. Turns out all that woo-woo TikTok relaxation breathing stuff was just bullshit. My heart was thumping like an angry jazz drummer's long-awaited solo. I felt sweat drip down my neck.

Something flickered on the painting. It momentarily took my eyes off the basement door. Like last night, I initially registered nothing different. Then I noticed. Through the window of the living room, it looked like someone had turned on a light or lit a fire. Splotches of yellow and orange paint filled the window frame.

The jingling of the basement door handle snapped me out of my trance. My palms were sweaty. My legs swayed like bamboo in a strong breeze. I gathered all my remaining strength and yelled out, ""Hey! St-stay away from me!"" I wanted to say more, but overwhelming fear shut me up.

The jiggling stopped. Relief. My hectoring worked...for about two seconds. The basement door cracked open. There was a ghostly, pale face staring back at me. That was when my brain firmly decided whether I was a fight-or-flight kinda gal.

I was flight.

""Fuck this."" I dropped the knife, which clattered on the tile like that drummer hitting the high-hat, and sprinted toward my front door. I yelled gibberish the entire time, tears streaming down my face, and blasted out of the door. My fingers hit send on the call, and seconds later, an annoyingly even-keeled 911 operator connected me with the police.

Parker returned home before the police arrived. He found me sitting inside my locked car. Before he could crack a joke, he caught sight of my face. I'd been crying and could feel how puffy my eyes were. Consternation crossed his face. I rolled the window down. ""Get in the car.""

He did. I explained everything to him. He was astonished. He was confused. He grabbed my hand and held it steady as I went over everything, pausing occasionally to sob like a child with a skinned knee. When I was done, he asked why I didn't leave right away.

""Who do you think you are, Rambo?""

I laughed. I need that. ""For a few seconds, I was. Then I wasn't. I wasn't even Gizmo pretending to be Rambo.""

He gave my arm a loving squeeze. ""If it'll help you calm down, we can watch some pro Wiffle ball tonight. I hear the Rhinos are playing the Turkeys.""

""Storks,"" I said, ""but they are actually playing the Habaneros tonight. Gil Faust is looking to debut his 'chili ball' pitch.""

He leaned in and kissed my forehead. ""But you're not a fan.""

""I'm not.""

A knock on the window caused me to scream. The cops had arrived. If they were curious why we were sitting in our car, they kept it to themselves. I relayed what happened, and they said they'd go into the basement and check it out.

Fifteen minutes later, they came walking out. ""We didn't see anyone down there,"" the Cop said. ""But, to be fair to you, your basement gave me the heebie-jeebies.""

""Great,"" I said.

""I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but it's the truth. On the plus side, I haven't seen that love seat since I was a kid.""

""Want it?""

""It's better left to the past. You two have a nice day.""

We watched them leave. Parker turned to me. ""You okay?""

""No, and I won't be until I go into the basement myself.""

""What? Why?""

""I…I can't explain. Something is drawing me there. It sounds crazy, I know, but I feel it in my bones.""

Parker saw the determined look in my eyes. This was going to happen. Had to happen. He sighed. ""Want me to go in first?""

""Yes,"" I said.

""Are you actually going to wait for me to go in or follow right behind me?""

""We both know the answer to that.""

Resuming our reverse waltz, we went back into the house. Once in the kitchen, we stopped near the painting. Parker looked over and agreed that there were changes. We turned our attention to the closed basement door. Parker put his hand on the handle.

""We don't have to go down here, Beth,"" he said. ""The cops didn't find anyone.""

""Alive. If there's a ghost in this house, I need to know. If we know, we can remove it.""

""How?""

""I'm still working on that part,"" I said. ""But I need to know for certain. I won't feel safe otherwise.""

""I'm inclined to just say yes and move on. Something altered the painting already. Who the hell did that?""

""One issue at a time,"" I said.

He knew he couldn't talk his way out of this. He knew I needed this, and he loved me enough to see it through to the end. Even though he was petrified, too. The skin on his arm had goosebumps as soon as we walked into the kitchen. It felt like braille to me now, and the only thing it said was ""let's not do this.""

But that feeling in my brain, the one drawing me down there, wouldn't leave. It was stronger now that we were in the home. Something was loose in my house. I knew it in my heart. Whatever it was, I needed to keep it from roosting in my new home. Let the ghosts live in the past. Leave my future alone.

Parker gripped the handle, sighed so loudly it was heard two towns over, and opened the door. The stairs led down into the dark of the basement. The floor around the landing was the only thing visible. In the abstract, it wasn't anything. Right now, though? Horrifying.

Parker found the light switch, illuminating the rest of the space. So far, so good. We took our time walking down the stairs. Creaking along the wooden one step at a time. Maybe it'd have the same effect on the ghost that hearing creaking steps did on me. Perhaps the phantom was hiding, holding a ghost knife and deciding if it was going to play ghost Rambo or just fearfully disappear into the walls.

""The house in the painting had a basement, too,"" I whispered. ""When I was a kid, I hated going down there. Any time of day. Just didn't feel natural, ya know?""

""Are you trying to get me to stop doing this?""

""Sorry, I'm rambling,"" I said. I kept right on rambling, though. ""What bothered me wasn't so much going down there. What scared me was the trip back up. Turning your back on the dark. I used to walk backwards up the stairs.""

""We can try that in a few minutes,"" Parker whispered back. ""Any other ghost stories you want to share before we hit the landing?""

""Sorry,"" I said. ""It just popped into my mind. I haven't thought about that fear in years. Since we moved away from there, actually.""

""That's not comforting.""

We got to the bottom and took a look around. Everything looked normal. No surprises. Just our old, ugly furniture and friendly Santa decorations smiling and giving us a frozen wave.

I thought about turning and heading back up, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was supposed to be down here. I was also positive Parker would be furious if I went darting up the stairs without him. Leaving him alone in Spook Central might be grounds for divorce.

We headed over to the furniture. There was a layer of dust on everything. I smacked the pillow, sending it flying into the air. I coughed and sneezed, instantly regretting my actions. Parker's withering glare told me he wasn't fond of my actions either.

""Sorry.""

""I don't see anything out of the ordinary here, do you?""

""No,"" I said. ""It looks like it always does.""

""Feeling gone? Can we go back upstairs now?""

Before I could answer, we heard the familiar chime from our security system, followed by the calm, reassuring voice informing us that our front door was open.

""What the fuck?"" I said.

""Shhh,"" Parker responded, his finger to his lips. He pointed up to the ceiling. We cocked our ears and concentrated. For about twenty seconds, there was nothing. Silence. It didn't last.

CREAAAAK.

The floorboards wheezed as someone took slow, deliberate steps above us. You could hear the footfalls as they moved from the front door to the hallway. Trembling, Parker pointed up at the ceiling. You could physically see the floor bow ever so slightly from the person's weight. I didn't even think that was possible.

""W-what do we do?"" I whispered.

""I don't know,"" Parker said. ""Maybe they'll leave?""

A second later, we were cloaked in total darkness. All the power in the house had gone out. The only light came from the sunlight streaming in from the open door at the top of the stairs. It wasn't much, but it was a beacon. Our lighthouse. Our way home.

""Let's…,"" is all I was able to say. Someone upstairs ran down the hall, through the kitchen, and to the basement door. They slammed it shut, plunging us into instant midnight.

I wanted to scream. To yell so loud it'd shake the heavens. But I couldn't. My body physically couldn't make that happen. It'd give away our location. I clutched Parker's shirt so hard I was afraid I'd rip it right off him. If it bothered him, he didn't say.

""This sucks,"" Parker mumbled. Understatement of the goddamn century.

""HO HO HO MERRY CHRISTMAS!"" One of our Santa decorations started going off. I nearly peed myself at Santa's sudden arrival. I imagined it would've been the same response I would've had if I had seen him as a kid.

Kris Kringle was soon joined by all of our Christmas decorations going off at once. Dozens of laughing Santas, lights flickering off and on, inflatables rising like zombified plastic bags. The noise was deafening, but strangely festive. The strobing lights in the pitch black caused afterimages to dance in my rods and cones. I slammed them shut and silently prayed for this all to end.

Someone must've heard because, as quickly as they'd come to life, they stopped.

We stood in the dark, not breathing. Not moving. Neither of us knew what to do. Nothing in my life had prepared me for this. I couldn't shake the idea that whatever was coming would be worse than what we'd already experienced.

There was a creaking again and a sudden rushing of blinding sunlight from the top of the stairs. Someone had opened the door. Before we could get a glimpse, the door slammed shut, and something sprinted down the now-dark stairs.

I pulled Parker back onto the old love seat. We sat on the edge and kept our heads on a swivel, even though the basement was too dark to see our own hands. We weren't alone anymore.

As my fingertips grazed the couch, I realized something. These were originally my parents. My parents got them when I was living in the house from the painting. They were a physical connection between the past and now. Are these what caused my sudden desire to come to the basement? Was I being manipulated by this thing?

Could I trust myself at all?

That dread feeling I'd had since I brought the painting into our house intensified. I felt it in my bones. Deeper even. My aura. My soul.

I leaned into Parker's ear and whispered an apology. He didn't vocalize a response, but squeezed my arm. I squeezed back. My body shook, and I couldn't get myself to stop. I wanted to run for the stairs, but that old fear came rushing back.

I knew if I ran up those stairs, it'd follow behind me.

Something wooshed by us. My hair flowed with it, trailing behind whatever had sprinted past. I nervously dug my fingers into the fabric. We heard the sound of some liquid splattering on the floor across from us. Water? No. Heavier than water. A sound that made my guts twist soon joined the drips and splashes.

Someone started whistling a familiar tune. Pop goes the weasel. The Christmas decorations flickered on and shut off. In the brief flash of light, we could make out a figure standing across from us.

Craig Moffit.

""POP!"" he screamed as the lights strobed.

""GOES!"" he screamed again, a foot closer this time.

""THE!"" Another foot closer. Almost directly in front of us now.

The lights flickered again, and his face was right next to mine. A sinister smile as he slowly whispered, ""weasel."" I felt something wet and slimy rub against my cheek.

Parker stood and, surprisingly, swung at ghost Craig. It didn't find the ghoul, and, as the darkness returned, his fist only found the arm of the couch. I heard his knuckles crack and him swear in pain.

My ears were the only thing working at that moment, though. I sat frozen, tears streaming down my face. The lights in the house came back on, and I screamed.

On the wall across from us, where we had heard the water, the painting was hanging. Only, it wasn't the old house. It was the current house. All the windows and doors were filled with flames. There were two figures on the front lawn. Parker and I. We were both dead. Standing behind our oak tree, watching it all, was Craig Moffit.

""Parker! Let's go!""

I didn't have to tell him twice. We broke for the stairs and took them three at a time until we reached the top. I grabbed the handle and shoved my shoulder into the door, expecting it to hold firm. It didn't. Parker and I spilled onto our kitchen floor.

I scrambled up and practically yanked Parker into the kitchen. I was about to slam the door when I saw Craig Moffit standing at the bottom of the stairs. We locked eyes. My mind flew back to my childhood. A memory stored deep in the folds of my brain. I was sitting on our porch reading a book and heard that damn whistling.

Craig Moffit. A Polaroid camera in his hands and portrait photos on his mind. I was afraid he'd stop and take a picture of me. I was right. Even now, I could hear the heavy clunk of the shutter and the whirring of the processing photo as it slid out. He shook it, and as the fog of war slowly dissipated on the photo, he smiled.

""This way, I won't forget you.""

I slammed the door shut and urged Parker to grab the car keys. He turned the corner to do so when I heard him sharply yelp in surprise, followed by the squeak of his sneakers on the hardwood and his ass hitting the ground. I ran to him expecting to see Craig, but was stunned by the sight of a living man surrounded by two yellow hulks outside my front door.

Once my brain processed the information, it was clear those men were wearing biohazard suits. It still didn't answer why men in biohazard suits were outside my door. But it cleared up that there were. The suitless man in the middle, though, had a more than striking resemblance to the ghost I'd just seen in my basement. Only younger. Fuller. Fleshy.

""Sorry to startle you both,"" the man said, raising his hands in peace. ""You contacted us about a painting you found. I'm David Moffit. Craig was my father.""

""You've got to be shitting me.""

""We were supposed to talk on the phone,"" I said.

""Yes, but we were worried things might have progressed too much by then. Tell me, has the door in the painting disappeared yet?""

""How did….""

David turned to his men. ""Call for the extraction team."" Turning back to us, he urgently asked, ""Where's the painting?""

""The basement,"" I said. ""But it looks different now.""

""What in hell is going on?"" Parker asked.

""Different? Would you say *violently* different?""

""'Our-dead-bodies-on-the-lawn-and-the-place-ablaze' violently different.""

He nervously turned to where the biohazard-suited men had gone. ""The *experienced* extraction team!""

Parker stood and held my hand. We looked at each other and back at David Moffit. We both cracked. Small smiles that turned into chuckles that turned into a laughing fit. I read somewhere that mental breaks can start like this. Whatever. I leaned in.

""David Moffit, the son of your childhood painter neighbor Craig Moffit, himself a ghost that nearly killed us, is standing in our *fucking* veranda,"" Parker said, barely able to get the words out between screeching laughter. ""I mean, what the fuck is this life?""

Seconds later, a team of armed men in hazmat suits carrying unknown machinery rushed in and headed for the basement. We heard one of them scream, and then the sounds of mechanical engines warming up. David nodded toward the front door.

""We should go outside.""

We did. What the hell else were we going to do? Once we were outside, David pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered us one. We both declined. David indulged and nodded back at the house. ""This is the experienced team.""

""What's going on?"" I asked.

""I'm going to level with you. What I'm about to say is pretty weird. I like to say weird to people. Sets the right tone.""

""Sir, on what is easily the weirdest day in not only my and my wife's life, but I'd argue humanity's life, nothing you can say will top what we've already been through,"" Parker said. ""I mean, I just discovered my wife watches professional Wiffle ball, for God's sake!""

""Not a fan,"" I mumbled.

""Dad was a strange man. Lots of demons. When he could keep them at bay, he did great work. But that was never for long. Around the time when you were a kid, he got deep into the occult. It was a faddish passing fancy at first, but soon he found a deeper meaning in it. It consumed him. Around this time, well, he conjured a demon.""

""I think I'm having a stroke.""

""He made a deal. We don't exactly know the details, but what we do know is that Dad agreed to start a company that would paint portraits of people's homes. The twist was that the homes he picked would become targets for the demon.""

""Naturally,"" Parker said. ""Because why not?""

""He'd take a photo of the home and give it to the demon. The demon would curse it and insert it into the canvases of my dad's paintings. These photos would be a connection between the subjects in the art and the demon itself. The pull got stronger when the artwork found its way back to the subjects. Then, they'd, well…."" He trailed off.

""Meet each other?"" I said.

""In a manner of speaking, yes.""

So many questions bounced around my brain. This all sounded so outlandish and yet…. The memory of the photo came back to me. ""This way, I won't forget you,"" I said out loud.

Confused, Parker looked at me. ""What?""

""We don't know how many paintings Dad did during this time, but we've recovered sixty-five in locations from New York to California. The people selected seemed to be random…except for you.""

""Why me?""

""My guess? You were neighbors and, well, my dad really didn't like your dad.""

""The feeling was mutual.""

Just then, the extraction team came rushing out. One was limping. The machines they brought looked broken, but the lights were still on. One of them had the painting in a bio-containment bag. It was smoking.

""The experienced team,"" David said, ashing out his smoke on the bottom of his shoe and pocketing the butt. ""Thank you for letting us help rid you of this…menace. The work is exhausting, but my family has to atone for Craig's wicked actions.""

David nodded and turned to leave. I reached out and grabbed his shoulder. ""Wait, that's it? We're free? Just like that.""

""Just like that,"" he said, turning to leave. He stopped and spun on his heels. ""Unless you have something from the old house in your new house. Then you kinda sorta leave a backdoor for the demon to return. So, if you do, I suggest destroying it."" He tipped his cap and left.

Parker and I locked eyes. ""The fucking love seat,"" we said at the same time. My back hurt just thinking about hauling it up those narrow stairs.

Later that night, we torched the sofa in a makeshift fire pit in our backyard. We ate pizza and watched the flames consume the potentially demonic couch. Can't imagine that's a sentence that's been said a lot in history. As we did, relief filled my heart. The dread was gone. I looked over at Parker and smiled.

""I think we can put to bed the argument about who had the weirder childhood, Park.""

He laughed. ""Yeah, summers with my Amish family can't compete with demons."" His phone buzzed. He looked down at the notification with concern. I felt my stomach twist.

""Please tell me it's good news.""

""The Rhinos/Habaneros game is about to start. I set a reminder. Wanna watch?""

I touched my heart and felt pure happiness surge through me. Tears. Grabbing his free hand, I held it tight and gave it a big squeeze. ""I have something to confess,"" I said. ""I think I'm a legitimate fan of professional Wiffle ball.""

""I know, babe. I know.""

We sat together, letting the crackling of a burning demon couch and the crack of a Wiffle ball bat fill the night air. I snuggled into Parker's shoulder. It was warm. Inviting. Home…and not one haunted by an angry ghost.

I wasn't turning down the street I grew up on. I wasn't standing near the large oak in the front yard of the house where I'd lost all my baby teeth. I wasn't sitting inside the kitchen, where, on my fifteenth birthday, I accidentally dropped the cake my mom had baked, which made my family laugh so hard that we shed tears. No. I was holding an oil painting at a Goodwill on the other side of the country.

""That can't be possible,"" my husband said.

""It can be possible, Parker, because I'm holding the flipping painting and telling you.""

""One, language. Two, can I say something without you jumping down my throat?"" Parker asked, his voice even.

""Yes,"" I said.

""Is there an outside chance that this just looks like your childhood home? I mean, you grew up in the burbs. A lot of cookie-cutter homes, no?""

I hated to admit he had a point. But as I stared at the house, I couldn't come around to that line of thinking. This was my house. Hell, the roses in the flower beds were the same size and color as I remembered them. ""No. I mean, I hear you and you're not off base. But, dude, this is my house."" I pointed at the porch. ""I broke that railing trying to do a ballet spin and fell into the bushes.""

""You? Miss Two Left Feet? Senorita Trips-a-lot? Tried to do a ballet spin?""

""To be fair, I did the spin. I just didn't stick the landing.""

""A minor detail in the world of dance. The landing part.""

""I landed…on the bushes right here,"" I said, pointing to the painting. ""Hold on, I have to send a photo to my mom.""

""Does she have old house photos?""

""Of course she does. You've met her, right?""

I had Parker hold the painting and snapped a few pictures. I sent them over to Mom and asked if she had a photo to compare it to. The message came back a minute later. ""OMG! That's our house! Weird."" Another ding brought us a house photo. It looked exactly like the artwork in my hand.

I showed Parker. ""Christ,"" he said. ""That's it.""

""Told you.""

""That's wild. Is it a print or a real painting?""

I ran my hand across the art. There was a palpable texture to the brush strokes. Sometimes, a print may have varnish applied to give the impression of brushstrokes. This wasn't that. ""I think this is real, but let me check something else,"" I said, walking toward the wall of ugly lamps.

I turned on a lamp and held the painting in front of the bulb. Some artists will draw the picture first in pencil before painting. Sometimes, you can see those marks when you hold it up to the light. Staring at the oak tree in the painting, I saw graphite streaks underneath.

""It's real,"" I declared.

""Who painted it?""

A slash of red paint in the corner mimicked a signature, but Parker and I stared at it as if it were written in Minoan Linear A. Parker traced the paint with his finger. Forwards and backwards. ""The first name may be George or Jeff? I think George. Look at how it flows."" He retraced the letters, and it made sense to me.

""Okay, what's the last name?""

""Hell if I know.""

I tried Parker's finger tracing. It felt like I was tracing a line drawing by someone with too much caffeine in their system. These didn't seem like actual letters.

""Might be Moffit,"" a soft voice said from behind us.

We turned and saw that a Goodwill employee had materialized. She was a short, frail-looking elderly woman with a hairstyle that resembled a well-constructed cumulus cloud in both color and shape.

""Moffit?"" I said.

""I think that's an 'm',"" she said, pointing to two humps. ""Then it kind of circles into an 'o' and the double fs. The 'I' and the 't' are somewhat stylized, I think. Artists being artists.""

I looked and, yeah, it kinda looked like Moffit. ""I can see it. George Moffit, you think?""

""I do. Beautiful piece. Don't you think?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""It looks exactly like the house I grew up in."" I showed her the photo my mom sent.

""How strange!""

""Right? I grew up across the country. Why is this even here?""

""When I was younger, there was a company that would paint your home for you.""

""Painters?"" Parker deadpanned.

""Ignore him,"" I said. ""He doesn't know how to act in public.""

She laughed. ""I understand. I have one just like him at home. That's why he's at home.""

I laughed. ""You're teaching and I'm taking notes, ma'am.""

""Anyway, they would come paint portraits of your house. It was a thing for a few years. This looks like one of those. There may be a company name on the back, under the frame.""

I flipped the painting over and gingerly removed the frame. Sure enough, there was a small, faded sticker that read ""Cozy Home Portraits Company."" There wasn't any other information. I made an impressed noise. ""Look at that. Have a jumping off point to find out what this is all about. Thank you so much….""

""Marge.""

""Marge, thank you. Sorry again for this guy.""

""Marge, please forgive me. You're a gentlewoman and a scholar.""

Marge leaned into him and nodded at me. ""You're punching above your weight with her, kiddo. Keep her happy.""

Parker laughed, wrapped his arm around my hip, and pulled me in for a hug. ""Marge, that's the best advice I've ever received from a Goodwill employee.""

""If only your barber had given you good advice. You could've avoided that haircut.""

I burst out laughing. Parker did too. ""Marge, I hope to grow up to be just like you.""

""You found a guy who can take a joke. That's a start. You guys wanna get that or still debating?""

I looked at Parker, and he nodded. ""How can we not get this? Even if it's just for the story.""

Marge smiled. ""See, you can learn. Come on, kids. I'll ring you up.""

When I got home, I immediately began researching the Cozy Home Portraits Company. I had a hard time finding anything. Most of the search results were links to people on Reddit asking the same questions. Apparently, there were a lot of folks like me who were surprised to find their childhood homes immortalized on canvas. One commenter said something that stuck with me.

""Parker, listen to this,"" I said, reading the post. ""My mom says she remembers someone approaching her and asking if they could take a photo so they could paint the house later. She told them no at first, but they said they'd do it for no cost. Mom agreed and assumed she'd get the painting at some point, but she never heard from the company again.""

""What's the next commenter say?""

""This sounds fake,"" I read. ""Kind of a dickish response, no?""

""It's Reddit,"" he said, shrugging. ""Maybe they just used the houses for inspiration and sold the paintings to commercial houses for reproductions?""

""Then why bother involving the homeowners at all?""

""Maybe to assuage their worries of someone standing outside their home snapping photos of their house?"" Parker suggested.

""I mean, anyone could take a photo of our house, and I'd have no idea unless I saw them do it.""

""True. It's weird, I'll grant you, but I think I'm on the right track. Commercial art. Americana stuff. That was to be it.""

He may have been onto something, but that answer didn't feel right. I couldn't work out the logic. If this company had been around for a while and painted portraits of homes all across the country for commercial sale, why wasn't there any record of them? No stories online. No official business records. No known CEO or lists of artists or anyone. Hell, even searching for the name George Moffit didn't yield results.

My mind told me there was something off about this. A sense of dread loomed over the whole thing. I let it marinate all day to see if I'd reconsider. Shocking no one, I didn't. I told Parker as much as we got ready for bed.

""You're reacting that way because of what's happening in the world right now,"" Parker said, yawning. ""There are real evil people out there, but they aren't painting pictures.""

""Hitler painted pictures,"" I said.

He gave me a deadpan stare. ""You know what I mean.""

""I just can't let it go. It's odd. Odd that it was done at all. Odd that it traveled all the way out here. Odd that I found it. Odd stacked on odd stack on odd.""

""Turtles all the way down.""

""What?"" I said, crinkling up my face. ""What do turtles have to do with anything?""

He laughed. ""Nothing. Just a dumb expression."" He yawned again. ""Why is this bothering you so much?""

""Some random company painted and sold pictures of my childhood house with no one knowing about it. It's….""

""Odd,"" he said with a smile.

""Very. It's just not sitting right with me.""

Parker yawned for a third time. ""My melatonin is kicking in here. Get some rest and see how you feel in the morning. Maybe call your mom, see if she has a story to tell. She might know something.""

He didn't wait for my response. Instead, he rolled over, shut off the lamp, and turned on our sound machine. As digital thunderstorms rolled into our bedroom, I lay down on my pillows but didn't fall asleep. This whole thing smothered my thoughts as much as my weighted blanket did my body.

I would call Mom tomorrow. See what she knew. If anything. I heard light snores coming from Parker's direction and sighed. That man could fall asleep even if the house were on fire. I flipped on YouTube, found something to help me sleep, and closed my eyes.

Or would have, if I hadn't seen our front porch light turn on.

A cold touched my brain and froze the rest of my body. The light going off didn't mean a prowler was trying to jimmy open our lock. It could be a bug flying too close to the sensor or a sleepwalking squirrel. Improbable? Sure, but they were better than the alternative. I didn't want to wake Parker, but I also wasn't keen on investigating alone.

While I was debating getting out of bed, I heard a noise in the kitchen. That made the decision easy. I elbowed Parker. ""What?"" he asked, his voice a blend of exhaustion and annoyance.

""Our front porch light went off,"" I whispered.

""Raccoons tripping the light,"" he said. ""Not worth waking me.""

""I know, but…but I heard someone in the kitchen.""

His eyes zinged open. In a flash, he was on his feet and grabbed the bat we kept near the bed. He quietly inched along the wall until he got to the bedroom doorway. He peeked out and scanned the room before turning back to me and shrugging.

I pointed to the kitchen again before popping up and joining him on the wall. Parker wasn't pleased. He told me, not in words but vigorous nods, to go back to the bed and wait. I didn't. He gave in, and we made our way out of the bedroom. Me walking directly behind him like some backwards waltz.

I saw nothing. That went double after Parker slammed his hand on the switch, flooding the room with light and damn near blinding me in the process. I let out a painful yelp and covered my eyes to adjust. I heard Parker sigh.

""We're good,"" he said. ""Nothing in here.""

""You gotta tell me before you do that,"" I said, finally checking out the room. Everything initially looked washed out. ""I'm nearly blind.""

""I wanted the element of surprise,"" Parker said.

""You achieved it,"" I said. ""All I see now are a bunch of little diamonds everywhere.""

He walked into the kitchen. ""Your intruder is nothing more than a fallen salt shaker,"" he said, holding up the culprit.

""Oh.""

""Like I said, a raccoon probably tripped the light. I'm going back to sleep. You should, too.""

He walked past me, patted my ass, and headed back to bed. I was about to join him when my eyes landed on the painting. I walked over to it and stared. In the store, looking at it had flooded my emotions with joy and happiness. But now? None of that.

Unease seeped into my blood and rushed through my body. Something was different about the painting. I couldn't put my finger on what had changed, but I knew something had. It was giving me chills. I grabbed a nearby napkin and draped it over the artwork like a coroner covering a dead body. My thinking was that if there was something supernatural about this thing, the napkin would keep it at bay.

Dumb, I know, but it made sense at the time.

""I couldn't believe that picture. That's so wild."" Mom was too chipper for this early in the morning. She always was, though. A real 'rise with the early bird' kind of gal.

That wasn't me. I still had bedhead as I sipped my cup of coffee. Parker, another early riser, cooked breakfast. ""I thought so too. Someone told me a company used to go around and paint pictures of homes. They'd ask the homeowners beforehand. Any memory of that?""

""Not that I can remember. Back then, it was mostly your father who spoke with salesmen. I found them unseemly. I can't imagine he'd allow someone to do that, rest his soul.""

""Yeah. Dad was pretty private.""

""We had a neighbor who was a painter, though. Carl, no, that wasn't it. Craig! Craig…aww goddamn my ancient brain. Bonnie, don't get old. It's hell.""

""I'm trying not to. It's why I do my nightly skincare routine.""

""It's intense,"" Parker added with a smirk.

""What was his name? It's been years since I thought of him. Craig…Morris? Something like that. He didn't live near us for long. Dad didn't like him. At all.""

""Why?""

""Craig was the human equivalent of a popcorn kernel stuck in your teeth. Irritating. He rubbed your father the wrong way.""

""I don't remember Dad talking about him.""

""He didn't around you, but with me, hoo boy. Craig used to walk by the house all the time, always whistling 'pop goes the weasel' for some reason. He'd stand too close when he talked to you. He'd leer at me when I was outside hanging laundry on the line. He'd never get the hint that I wanted to be left alone, even though I was always short with him. Especially after he said that you were growing up nicely.""

""Gross,"" I said. ""I was ten.""

""Like I said, he was a weirdo. But, again, most artiste types are, I suppose. Remember your Uncle Walter? Made those ghastly papier mache skulls. They used to be all over his house. Was like walking into some cannibal's hut whenever we'd go over there. But he was good at making them. Who'd want them is another thing altogether. He gave us one, and I made your dad keep it in a bag in the garage. 'Don't bring that ghoulish shit in my house.'""

As my mom rambled about skull shapes like a Victorian phrenologist, a thought came to me. I looked down at the painting and traced the painter's name. ""Mom, could his name have been Craig Moffit?""

Parker looked over at me. I nodded down at the painting and traced what I thought the letters were with my finger. He hit his forehead with the spatula and shook his head.

""OH MY GOD! Yes! That was it! Craig Moffit. God, what a blast from the past. He really was a weird little freak of a man,"" my mom said, laughing. ""He used to wear these tiny little shorts, and he did *not* have the legs for it. Looked like two toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Mom droned on a little longer, but provided nothing of substance beyond Craig Moffit's horrid legs. But she'd given me some new information - the artist's real name. As soon as I hung up, I grabbed my laptop.

""Craig Moffit! Not George! Craig!""

""I see it now,"" Parker said. ""We should've never trusted Marge. Didn't like the cut of her jib.""

""Babe, her jib was flawless,"" I said, turning to the painting. ""Her eyes, not so much.""

""To be fair, we all agreed it was George Moffit….""

""There! There's Craig Moffit!"" I turned the computer around and showed a webpage dedicated to his art. Parker leaned down to get a closer look.

""His legs do look like toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Rolling my eyes, I turned the laptop back to me and clicked on the man's ""About Me"" page. It was illuminating. Craig had quite the little career. He'd worked for a few newspaper outlets. A few magazines. Some ad campaigns. His stuff was good. There was a list of known works.

""There are a few house paintings listed here. It has to be him.""

""Has anyone mentioned how odd this is?"" Parker said with a sly smile.

""It's catching on.""

""Maybe he saw your home as a happy family home and wanted to capture it for that company. Is there a contact page?""

""There is!"" I yelped. I read the page out loud. ""If you have questions about Craig or his work, please feel free to reach out here,"" I said.

""That's great. You can email him and ask directly.""

""Moffit estate at Moffit art dot com,"" I read. ""Shit. He's dead.""

""That shouldn't matter. Maybe the guy who runs the estate can answer your questions?""

I nodded. It was worth a shot. I started composing a message, and Parker went back to breakfast. I glanced at the artwork on the table next to me. Something about it picked at my brain.

""Hey, I meant to ask, have you been watching professional Wiffle ball games on our YouTube?""

""Oh, yeah. I've started turning on games after your melatonin kicks in. Puts me right out.""

""Uh-huh. Are you a Wiffle ball fan?""

""No,"" I said, laughing. ""I just happened across it one night, and I fell asleep like ten minutes into a game. It's better than ocean waves. Which game was it?""

""Umm, Rhinos against the….""

""Storks? Oh man, those two teams hate each other. Storks have won the last three series behind Dustin Braddock's nasty banana ball…."" I stopped speaking because I could feel Parker's smug smirk on his face. I looked up and caught it with my own eyes. ""Not a fan.""

""What the hell is a banana ball?""

PING!

""They emailed back already,"" I said. ""What the hell?""

""Maybe there isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate?""

""Hi, Craig Moffit was my father. He did several pieces of local homes during that era. I would love to discuss this with you. Can we set up a call?""

""So there clearly isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate,"" Parker said.

""I'm going to say yes. I think I have to, if for no other reason than my own sanity.""

""Go for it. I can be there for the call if you need me.""

So I set up a call with the estate for later that day. Hopefully, there'd be some information that I could use to stop the itch in my brain. Parker served me breakfast before he got ready to head out to the gym.

""You never told me what a banana ball is,"" he said, placing the plate in front of me.

""It's a side arm slurve. A strikeout pitch. Nearly unhittable if Braddock is on his game."" Parker gave me a quizzical look. I sighed. ""Not a fan.""

After Parker had left for the gym, I went back over to the painting. It was still sitting in the last place I had left it. Still had the napkin over it. The bad vibes I felt earlier were still there. In fact, they'd grown worse. I didn't even want this thing in my house anymore - covered or not.

Despite my misgivings, I pulled the napkin off the painting and gave it a once-over. I felt my stomach gurgle, and my throat went dry. Looking at this now literally caused physical pain. It didn't make sense.

""Where's the front door?"" I suddenly asked myself out loud.

The front door of the house was gone. Blacked out like an actor with perfect teeth coloring in one to look sufficiently destitute for a role. I scraped where the door had been with my thumb. No fresh paint. It was like it had always been that way. But it hadn't. I checked the photo I sent to my mom to confirm.

""What in the….""

There was a creak on the basement stairs. There very much shouldn't have been a creak on the basement stairs. The basement was home to nothing but dust, Christmas decorations, and my ugly childhood couches we didn't have the heart to throw away. Since none of those things can walk, this made no sense.

I tiptoed to the knife block and pulled out a butcher knife. With my phone in my free hand, I used my nimble thumb to unlock it. I was ready to dial 911. But, as I stared at my reflection in the knife blade, I questioned whether I was prepared to stick it into another person. I wouldn't know that until it came to that moment. I very much prayed that wouldn't happen.

Another creak. Near the top of the stairs now. It was getting closer. I flexed the grip on the knife. I tried to control my breathing, but couldn't. Turns out all that woo-woo TikTok relaxation breathing stuff was just bullshit. My heart was thumping like an angry jazz drummer's long-awaited solo. I felt sweat drip down my neck.

Something flickered on the painting. It momentarily took my eyes off the basement door. Like last night, I initially registered nothing different. Then I noticed. Through the window of the living room, it looked like someone had turned on a light or lit a fire. Splotches of yellow and orange paint filled the window frame.

The jingling of the basement door handle snapped me out of my trance. My palms were sweaty. My legs swayed like bamboo in a strong breeze. I gathered all my remaining strength and yelled out, ""Hey! St-stay away from me!"" I wanted to say more, but overwhelming fear shut me up.

The jiggling stopped. Relief. My hectoring worked...for about two seconds. The basement door cracked open. There was a ghostly, pale face staring back at me. That was when my brain firmly decided whether I was a fight-or-flight kinda gal.

I was flight.

""Fuck this."" I dropped the knife, which clattered on the tile like that drummer hitting the high-hat, and sprinted toward my front door. I yelled gibberish the entire time, tears streaming down my face, and blasted out of the door. My fingers hit send on the call, and seconds later, an annoyingly even-keeled 911 operator connected me with the police.

Parker returned home before the police arrived. He found me sitting inside my locked car. Before he could crack a joke, he caught sight of my face. I'd been crying and could feel how puffy my eyes were. Consternation crossed his face. I rolled the window down. ""Get in the car.""

He did. I explained everything to him. He was astonished. He was confused. He grabbed my hand and held it steady as I went over everything, pausing occasionally to sob like a child with a skinned knee. When I was done, he asked why I didn't leave right away.

""Who do you think you are, Rambo?""

I laughed. I need that. ""For a few seconds, I was. Then I wasn't. I wasn't even Gizmo pretending to be Rambo.""

He gave my arm a loving squeeze. ""If it'll help you calm down, we can watch some pro Wiffle ball tonight. I hear the Rhinos are playing the Turkeys.""

""Storks,"" I said, ""but they are actually playing the Habaneros tonight. Gil Faust is looking to debut his 'chili ball' pitch.""

He leaned in and kissed my forehead. ""But you're not a fan.""

""I'm not.""

A knock on the window caused me to scream. The cops had arrived. If they were curious why we were sitting in our car, they kept it to themselves. I relayed what happened, and they said they'd go into the basement and check it out.

Fifteen minutes later, they came walking out. ""We didn't see anyone down there,"" the Cop said. ""But, to be fair to you, your basement gave me the heebie-jeebies.""

""Great,"" I said.

""I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but it's the truth. On the plus side, I haven't seen that love seat since I was a kid.""

""Want it?""

""It's better left to the past. You two have a nice day.""

We watched them leave. Parker turned to me. ""You okay?""

""No, and I won't be until I go into the basement myself.""

""What? Why?""

""I…I can't explain. Something is drawing me there. It sounds crazy, I know, but I feel it in my bones.""

Parker saw the determined look in my eyes. This was going to happen. Had to happen. He sighed. ""Want me to go in first?""

""Yes,"" I said.

""Are you actually going to wait for me to go in or follow right behind me?""

""We both know the answer to that.""

Resuming our reverse waltz, we went back into the house. Once in the kitchen, we stopped near the painting. Parker looked over and agreed that there were changes. We turned our attention to the closed basement door. Parker put his hand on the handle.

""We don't have to go down here, Beth,"" he said. ""The cops didn't find anyone.""

""Alive. If there's a ghost in this house, I need to know. If we know, we can remove it.""

""How?""

""I'm still working on that part,"" I said. ""But I need to know for certain. I won't feel safe otherwise.""

""I'm inclined to just say yes and move on. Something altered the painting already. Who the hell did that?""

""One issue at a time,"" I said.

He knew he couldn't talk his way out of this. He knew I needed this, and he loved me enough to see it through to the end. Even though he was petrified, too. The skin on his arm had goosebumps as soon as we walked into the kitchen. It felt like braille to me now, and the only thing it said was ""let's not do this.""

But that feeling in my brain, the one drawing me down there, wouldn't leave. It was stronger now that we were in the home. Something was loose in my house. I knew it in my heart. Whatever it was, I needed to keep it from roosting in my new home. Let the ghosts live in the past. Leave my future alone.

Parker gripped the handle, sighed so loudly it was heard two towns over, and opened the door. The stairs led down into the dark of the basement. The floor around the landing was the only thing visible. In the abstract, it wasn't anything. Right now, though? Horrifying.

Parker found the light switch, illuminating the rest of the space. So far, so good. We took our time walking down the stairs. Creaking along the wooden one step at a time. Maybe it'd have the same effect on the ghost that hearing creaking steps did on me. Perhaps the phantom was hiding, holding a ghost knife and deciding if it was going to play ghost Rambo or just fearfully disappear into the walls.

""The house in the painting had a basement, too,"" I whispered. ""When I was a kid, I hated going down there. Any time of day. Just didn't feel natural, ya know?""

""Are you trying to get me to stop doing this?""

""Sorry, I'm rambling,"" I said. I kept right on rambling, though. ""What bothered me wasn't so much going down there. What scared me was the trip back up. Turning your back on the dark. I used to walk backwards up the stairs.""

""We can try that in a few minutes,"" Parker whispered back. ""Any other ghost stories you want to share before we hit the landing?""

""Sorry,"" I said. ""It just popped into my mind. I haven't thought about that fear in years. Since we moved away from there, actually.""

""That's not comforting.""

We got to the bottom and took a look around. Everything looked normal. No surprises. Just our old, ugly furniture and friendly Santa decorations smiling and giving us a frozen wave.

I thought about turning and heading back up, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was supposed to be down here. I was also positive Parker would be furious if I went darting up the stairs without him. Leaving him alone in Spook Central might be grounds for divorce.

We headed over to the furniture. There was a layer of dust on everything. I smacked the pillow, sending it flying into the air. I coughed and sneezed, instantly regretting my actions. Parker's withering glare told me he wasn't fond of my actions either.

""Sorry.""

""I don't see anything out of the ordinary here, do you?""

""No,"" I said. ""It looks like it always does.""

""Feeling gone? Can we go back upstairs now?""

Before I could answer, we heard the familiar chime from our security system, followed by the calm, reassuring voice informing us that our front door was open.

""What the fuck?"" I said.

""Shhh,"" Parker responded, his finger to his lips. He pointed up to the ceiling. We cocked our ears and concentrated. For about twenty seconds, there was nothing. Silence. It didn't last.

CREAAAAK.

The floorboards wheezed as someone took slow, deliberate steps above us. You could hear the footfalls as they moved from the front door to the hallway. Trembling, Parker pointed up at the ceiling. You could physically see the floor bow ever so slightly from the person's weight. I didn't even think that was possible.

""W-what do we do?"" I whispered.

""I don't know,"" Parker said. ""Maybe they'll leave?""

A second later, we were cloaked in total darkness. All the power in the house had gone out. The only light came from the sunlight streaming in from the open door at the top of the stairs. It wasn't much, but it was a beacon. Our lighthouse. Our way home.

""Let's…,"" is all I was able to say. Someone upstairs ran down the hall, through the kitchen, and to the basement door. They slammed it shut, plunging us into instant midnight.

I wanted to scream. To yell so loud it'd shake the heavens. But I couldn't. My body physically couldn't make that happen. It'd give away our location. I clutched Parker's shirt so hard I was afraid I'd rip it right off him. If it bothered him, he didn't say.

""This sucks,"" Parker mumbled. Understatement of the goddamn century.

""HO HO HO MERRY CHRISTMAS!"" One of our Santa decorations started going off. I nearly peed myself at Santa's sudden arrival. I imagined it would've been the same response I would've had if I had seen him as a kid.

Kris Kringle was soon joined by all of our Christmas decorations going off at once. Dozens of laughing Santas, lights flickering off and on, inflatables rising like zombified plastic bags. The noise was deafening, but strangely festive. The strobing lights in the pitch black caused afterimages to dance in my rods and cones. I slammed them shut and silently prayed for this all to end.

Someone must've heard because, as quickly as they'd come to life, they stopped.

We stood in the dark, not breathing. Not moving. Neither of us knew what to do. Nothing in my life had prepared me for this. I couldn't shake the idea that whatever was coming would be worse than what we'd already experienced.

There was a creaking again and a sudden rushing of blinding sunlight from the top of the stairs. Someone had opened the door. Before we could get a glimpse, the door slammed shut, and something sprinted down the now-dark stairs.

I pulled Parker back onto the old love seat. We sat on the edge and kept our heads on a swivel, even though the basement was too dark to see our own hands. We weren't alone anymore.

As my fingertips grazed the couch, I realized something. These were originally my parents. My parents got them when I was living in the house from the painting. They were a physical connection between the past and now. Are these what caused my sudden desire to come to the basement? Was I being manipulated by this thing?

Could I trust myself at all?

That dread feeling I'd had since I brought the painting into our house intensified. I felt it in my bones. Deeper even. My aura. My soul.

I leaned into Parker's ear and whispered an apology. He didn't vocalize a response, but squeezed my arm. I squeezed back. My body shook, and I couldn't get myself to stop. I wanted to run for the stairs, but that old fear came rushing back.

I knew if I ran up those stairs, it'd follow behind me.

Something wooshed by us. My hair flowed with it, trailing behind whatever had sprinted past. I nervously dug my fingers into the fabric. We heard the sound of some liquid splattering on the floor across from us. Water? No. Heavier than water. A sound that made my guts twist soon joined the drips and splashes.

Someone started whistling a familiar tune. Pop goes the weasel. The Christmas decorations flickered on and shut off. In the brief flash of light, we could make out a figure standing across from us.

Craig Moffit.

""POP!"" he screamed as the lights strobed.

""GOES!"" he screamed again, a foot closer this time.

""THE!"" Another foot closer. Almost directly in front of us now.

The lights flickered again, and his face was right next to mine. A sinister smile as he slowly whispered, ""weasel."" I felt something wet and slimy rub against my cheek.

Parker stood and, surprisingly, swung at ghost Craig. It didn't find the ghoul, and, as the darkness returned, his fist only found the arm of the couch. I heard his knuckles crack and him swear in pain.

My ears were the only thing working at that moment, though. I sat frozen, tears streaming down my face. The lights in the house came back on, and I screamed.

On the wall across from us, where we had heard the water, the painting was hanging. Only, it wasn't the old house. It was the current house. All the windows and doors were filled with flames. There were two figures on the front lawn. Parker and I. We were both dead. Standing behind our oak tree, watching it all, was Craig Moffit.

""Parker! Let's go!""

I didn't have to tell him twice. We broke for the stairs and took them three at a time until we reached the top. I grabbed the handle and shoved my shoulder into the door, expecting it to hold firm. It didn't. Parker and I spilled onto our kitchen floor.

I scrambled up and practically yanked Parker into the kitchen. I was about to slam the door when I saw Craig Moffit standing at the bottom of the stairs. We locked eyes. My mind flew back to my childhood. A memory stored deep in the folds of my brain. I was sitting on our porch reading a book and heard that damn whistling.

Craig Moffit. A Polaroid camera in his hands and portrait photos on his mind. I was afraid he'd stop and take a picture of me. I was right. Even now, I could hear the heavy clunk of the shutter and the whirring of the processing photo as it slid out. He shook it, and as the fog of war slowly dissipated on the photo, he smiled.

""This way, I won't forget you.""

I slammed the door shut and urged Parker to grab the car keys. He turned the corner to do so when I heard him sharply yelp in surprise, followed by the squeak of his sneakers on the hardwood and his ass hitting the ground. I ran to him expecting to see Craig, but was stunned by the sight of a living man surrounded by two yellow hulks outside my front door.

Once my brain processed the information, it was clear those men were wearing biohazard suits. It still didn't answer why men in biohazard suits were outside my door. But it cleared up that there were. The suitless man in the middle, though, had a more than striking resemblance to the ghost I'd just seen in my basement. Only younger. Fuller. Fleshy.

""Sorry to startle you both,"" the man said, raising his hands in peace. ""You contacted us about a painting you found. I'm David Moffit. Craig was my father.""

""You've got to be shitting me.""

""We were supposed to talk on the phone,"" I said.

""Yes, but we were worried things might have progressed too much by then. Tell me, has the door in the painting disappeared yet?""

""How did….""

David turned to his men. ""Call for the extraction team."" Turning back to us, he urgently asked, ""Where's the painting?""

""The basement,"" I said. ""But it looks different now.""

""What in hell is going on?"" Parker asked.

""Different? Would you say *violently* different?""

""'Our-dead-bodies-on-the-lawn-and-the-place-ablaze' violently different.""

He nervously turned to where the biohazard-suited men had gone. ""The *experienced* extraction team!""

Parker stood and held my hand. We looked at each other and back at David Moffit. We both cracked. Small smiles that turned into chuckles that turned into a laughing fit. I read somewhere that mental breaks can start like this. Whatever. I leaned in.

""David Moffit, the son of your childhood painter neighbor Craig Moffit, himself a ghost that nearly killed us, is standing in our *fucking* veranda,"" Parker said, barely able to get the words out between screeching laughter. ""I mean, what the fuck is this life?""

Seconds later, a team of armed men in hazmat suits carrying unknown machinery rushed in and headed for the basement. We heard one of them scream, and then the sounds of mechanical engines warming up. David nodded toward the front door.

""We should go outside.""

We did. What the hell else were we going to do? Once we were outside, David pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered us one. We both declined. David indulged and nodded back at the house. ""This is the experienced team.""

""What's going on?"" I asked.

""I'm going to level with you. What I'm about to say is pretty weird. I like to say weird to people. Sets the right tone.""

""Sir, on what is easily the weirdest day in not only my and my wife's life, but I'd argue humanity's life, nothing you can say will top what we've already been through,"" Parker said. ""I mean, I just discovered my wife watches professional Wiffle ball, for God's sake!""

""Not a fan,"" I mumbled.

""Dad was a strange man. Lots of demons. When he could keep them at bay, he did great work. But that was never for long. Around the time when you were a kid, he got deep into the occult. It was a faddish passing fancy at first, but soon he found a deeper meaning in it. It consumed him. Around this time, well, he conjured a demon.""

""I think I'm having a stroke.""

""He made a deal. We don't exactly know the details, but what we do know is that Dad agreed to start a company that would paint portraits of people's homes. The twist was that the homes he picked would become targets for the demon.""

""Naturally,"" Parker said. ""Because why not?""

""He'd take a photo of the home and give it to the demon. The demon would curse it and insert it into the canvases of my dad's paintings. These photos would be a connection between the subjects in the art and the demon itself. The pull got stronger when the artwork found its way back to the subjects. Then, they'd, well…."" He trailed off.

""Meet each other?"" I said.

""In a manner of speaking, yes.""

So many questions bounced around my brain. This all sounded so outlandish and yet…. The memory of the photo came back to me. ""This way, I won't forget you,"" I said out loud.

Confused, Parker looked at me. ""What?""

""We don't know how many paintings Dad did during this time, but we've recovered sixty-five in locations from New York to California. The people selected seemed to be random…except for you.""

""Why me?""

""My guess? You were neighbors and, well, my dad really didn't like your dad.""

""The feeling was mutual.""

Just then, the extraction team came rushing out. One was limping. The machines they brought looked broken, but the lights were still on. One of them had the painting in a bio-containment bag. It was smoking.

""The experienced team,"" David said, ashing out his smoke on the bottom of his shoe and pocketing the butt. ""Thank you for letting us help rid you of this…menace. The work is exhausting, but my family has to atone for Craig's wicked actions.""

David nodded and turned to leave. I reached out and grabbed his shoulder. ""Wait, that's it? We're free? Just like that.""

""Just like that,"" he said, turning to leave. He stopped and spun on his heels. ""Unless you have something from the old house in your new house. Then you kinda sorta leave a backdoor for the demon to return. So, if you do, I suggest destroying it."" He tipped his cap and left.

Parker and I locked eyes. ""The fucking love seat,"" we said at the same time. My back hurt just thinking about hauling it up those narrow stairs.

Later that night, we torched the sofa in a makeshift fire pit in our backyard. We ate pizza and watched the flames consume the potentially demonic couch. Can't imagine that's a sentence that's been said a lot in history. As we did, relief filled my heart. The dread was gone. I looked over at Parker and smiled.

""I think we can put to bed the argument about who had the weirder childhood, Park.""

He laughed. ""Yeah, summers with my Amish family can't compete with demons."" His phone buzzed. He looked down at the notification with concern. I felt my stomach twist.

""Please tell me it's good news.""

""The Rhinos/Habaneros game is about to start. I set a reminder. Wanna watch?""

I touched my heart and felt pure happiness surge through me. Tears. Grabbing his free hand, I held it tight and gave it a big squeeze. ""I have something to confess,"" I said. ""I think I'm a legitimate fan of professional Wiffle ball.""

""I know, babe. I know.""

We sat together, letting the crackling of a burning demon couch and the crack of a Wiffle ball bat fill the night air. I snuggled into Parker's shoulder. It was warm. Inviting. Home…and not one haunted by an angry ghost.

I wasn't turning down the street I grew up on. I wasn't standing near the large oak in the front yard of the house where I'd lost all my baby teeth. I wasn't sitting inside the kitchen, where, on my fifteenth birthday, I accidentally dropped the cake my mom had baked, which made my family laugh so hard that we shed tears. No. I was holding an oil painting at a Goodwill on the other side of the country.

""That can't be possible,"" my husband said.

""It can be possible, Parker, because I'm holding the flipping painting and telling you.""

""One, language. Two, can I say something without you jumping down my throat?"" Parker asked, his voice even.

""Yes,"" I said.

""Is there an outside chance that this just looks like your childhood home? I mean, you grew up in the burbs. A lot of cookie-cutter homes, no?""

I hated to admit he had a point. But as I stared at the house, I couldn't come around to that line of thinking. This was my house. Hell, the roses in the flower beds were the same size and color as I remembered them. ""No. I mean, I hear you and you're not off base. But, dude, this is my house."" I pointed at the porch. ""I broke that railing trying to do a ballet spin and fell into the bushes.""

""You? Miss Two Left Feet? Senorita Trips-a-lot? Tried to do a ballet spin?""

""To be fair, I did the spin. I just didn't stick the landing.""

""A minor detail in the world of dance. The landing part.""

""I landed…on the bushes right here,"" I said, pointing to the painting. ""Hold on, I have to send a photo to my mom.""

""Does she have old house photos?""

""Of course she does. You've met her, right?""

I had Parker hold the painting and snapped a few pictures. I sent them over to Mom and asked if she had a photo to compare it to. The message came back a minute later. ""OMG! That's our house! Weird."" Another ding brought us a house photo. It looked exactly like the artwork in my hand.

I showed Parker. ""Christ,"" he said. ""That's it.""

""Told you.""

""That's wild. Is it a print or a real painting?""

I ran my hand across the art. There was a palpable texture to the brush strokes. Sometimes, a print may have varnish applied to give the impression of brushstrokes. This wasn't that. ""I think this is real, but let me check something else,"" I said, walking toward the wall of ugly lamps.

I turned on a lamp and held the painting in front of the bulb. Some artists will draw the picture first in pencil before painting. Sometimes, you can see those marks when you hold it up to the light. Staring at the oak tree in the painting, I saw graphite streaks underneath.

""It's real,"" I declared.

""Who painted it?""

A slash of red paint in the corner mimicked a signature, but Parker and I stared at it as if it were written in Minoan Linear A. Parker traced the paint with his finger. Forwards and backwards. ""The first name may be George or Jeff? I think George. Look at how it flows."" He retraced the letters, and it made sense to me.

""Okay, what's the last name?""

""Hell if I know.""

I tried Parker's finger tracing. It felt like I was tracing a line drawing by someone with too much caffeine in their system. These didn't seem like actual letters.

""Might be Moffit,"" a soft voice said from behind us.

We turned and saw that a Goodwill employee had materialized. She was a short, frail-looking elderly woman with a hairstyle that resembled a well-constructed cumulus cloud in both color and shape.

""Moffit?"" I said.

""I think that's an 'm',"" she said, pointing to two humps. ""Then it kind of circles into an 'o' and the double fs. The 'I' and the 't' are somewhat stylized, I think. Artists being artists.""

I looked and, yeah, it kinda looked like Moffit. ""I can see it. George Moffit, you think?""

""I do. Beautiful piece. Don't you think?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""It looks exactly like the house I grew up in."" I showed her the photo my mom sent.

""How strange!""

""Right? I grew up across the country. Why is this even here?""

""When I was younger, there was a company that would paint your home for you.""

""Painters?"" Parker deadpanned.

""Ignore him,"" I said. ""He doesn't know how to act in public.""

She laughed. ""I understand. I have one just like him at home. That's why he's at home.""

I laughed. ""You're teaching and I'm taking notes, ma'am.""

""Anyway, they would come paint portraits of your house. It was a thing for a few years. This looks like one of those. There may be a company name on the back, under the frame.""

I flipped the painting over and gingerly removed the frame. Sure enough, there was a small, faded sticker that read ""Cozy Home Portraits Company."" There wasn't any other information. I made an impressed noise. ""Look at that. Have a jumping off point to find out what this is all about. Thank you so much….""

""Marge.""

""Marge, thank you. Sorry again for this guy.""

""Marge, please forgive me. You're a gentlewoman and a scholar.""

Marge leaned into him and nodded at me. ""You're punching above your weight with her, kiddo. Keep her happy.""

Parker laughed, wrapped his arm around my hip, and pulled me in for a hug. ""Marge, that's the best advice I've ever received from a Goodwill employee.""

""If only your barber had given you good advice. You could've avoided that haircut.""

I burst out laughing. Parker did too. ""Marge, I hope to grow up to be just like you.""

""You found a guy who can take a joke. That's a start. You guys wanna get that or still debating?""

I looked at Parker, and he nodded. ""How can we not get this? Even if it's just for the story.""

Marge smiled. ""See, you can learn. Come on, kids. I'll ring you up.""

When I got home, I immediately began researching the Cozy Home Portraits Company. I had a hard time finding anything. Most of the search results were links to people on Reddit asking the same questions. Apparently, there were a lot of folks like me who were surprised to find their childhood homes immortalized on canvas. One commenter said something that stuck with me.

""Parker, listen to this,"" I said, reading the post. ""My mom says she remembers someone approaching her and asking if they could take a photo so they could paint the house later. She told them no at first, but they said they'd do it for no cost. Mom agreed and assumed she'd get the painting at some point, but she never heard from the company again.""

""What's the next commenter say?""

""This sounds fake,"" I read. ""Kind of a dickish response, no?""

""It's Reddit,"" he said, shrugging. ""Maybe they just used the houses for inspiration and sold the paintings to commercial houses for reproductions?""

""Then why bother involving the homeowners at all?""

""Maybe to assuage their worries of someone standing outside their home snapping photos of their house?"" Parker suggested.

""I mean, anyone could take a photo of our house, and I'd have no idea unless I saw them do it.""

""True. It's weird, I'll grant you, but I think I'm on the right track. Commercial art. Americana stuff. That was to be it.""

He may have been onto something, but that answer didn't feel right. I couldn't work out the logic. If this company had been around for a while and painted portraits of homes all across the country for commercial sale, why wasn't there any record of them? No stories online. No official business records. No known CEO or lists of artists or anyone. Hell, even searching for the name George Moffit didn't yield results.

My mind told me there was something off about this. A sense of dread loomed over the whole thing. I let it marinate all day to see if I'd reconsider. Shocking no one, I didn't. I told Parker as much as we got ready for bed.

""You're reacting that way because of what's happening in the world right now,"" Parker said, yawning. ""There are real evil people out there, but they aren't painting pictures.""

""Hitler painted pictures,"" I said.

He gave me a deadpan stare. ""You know what I mean.""

""I just can't let it go. It's odd. Odd that it was done at all. Odd that it traveled all the way out here. Odd that I found it. Odd stacked on odd stack on odd.""

""Turtles all the way down.""

""What?"" I said, crinkling up my face. ""What do turtles have to do with anything?""

He laughed. ""Nothing. Just a dumb expression."" He yawned again. ""Why is this bothering you so much?""

""Some random company painted and sold pictures of my childhood house with no one knowing about it. It's….""

""Odd,"" he said with a smile.

""Very. It's just not sitting right with me.""

Parker yawned for a third time. ""My melatonin is kicking in here. Get some rest and see how you feel in the morning. Maybe call your mom, see if she has a story to tell. She might know something.""

He didn't wait for my response. Instead, he rolled over, shut off the lamp, and turned on our sound machine. As digital thunderstorms rolled into our bedroom, I lay down on my pillows but didn't fall asleep. This whole thing smothered my thoughts as much as my weighted blanket did my body.

I would call Mom tomorrow. See what she knew. If anything. I heard light snores coming from Parker's direction and sighed. That man could fall asleep even if the house were on fire. I flipped on YouTube, found something to help me sleep, and closed my eyes.

Or would have, if I hadn't seen our front porch light turn on.

A cold touched my brain and froze the rest of my body. The light going off didn't mean a prowler was trying to jimmy open our lock. It could be a bug flying too close to the sensor or a sleepwalking squirrel. Improbable? Sure, but they were better than the alternative. I didn't want to wake Parker, but I also wasn't keen on investigating alone.

While I was debating getting out of bed, I heard a noise in the kitchen. That made the decision easy. I elbowed Parker. ""What?"" he asked, his voice a blend of exhaustion and annoyance.

""Our front porch light went off,"" I whispered.

""Raccoons tripping the light,"" he said. ""Not worth waking me.""

""I know, but…but I heard someone in the kitchen.""

His eyes zinged open. In a flash, he was on his feet and grabbed the bat we kept near the bed. He quietly inched along the wall until he got to the bedroom doorway. He peeked out and scanned the room before turning back to me and shrugging.

I pointed to the kitchen again before popping up and joining him on the wall. Parker wasn't pleased. He told me, not in words but vigorous nods, to go back to the bed and wait. I didn't. He gave in, and we made our way out of the bedroom. Me walking directly behind him like some backwards waltz.

I saw nothing. That went double after Parker slammed his hand on the switch, flooding the room with light and damn near blinding me in the process. I let out a painful yelp and covered my eyes to adjust. I heard Parker sigh.

""We're good,"" he said. ""Nothing in here.""

""You gotta tell me before you do that,"" I said, finally checking out the room. Everything initially looked washed out. ""I'm nearly blind.""

""I wanted the element of surprise,"" Parker said.

""You achieved it,"" I said. ""All I see now are a bunch of little diamonds everywhere.""

He walked into the kitchen. ""Your intruder is nothing more than a fallen salt shaker,"" he said, holding up the culprit.

""Oh.""

""Like I said, a raccoon probably tripped the light. I'm going back to sleep. You should, too.""

He walked past me, patted my ass, and headed back to bed. I was about to join him when my eyes landed on the painting. I walked over to it and stared. In the store, looking at it had flooded my emotions with joy and happiness. But now? None of that.

Unease seeped into my blood and rushed through my body. Something was different about the painting. I couldn't put my finger on what had changed, but I knew something had. It was giving me chills. I grabbed a nearby napkin and draped it over the artwork like a coroner covering a dead body. My thinking was that if there was something supernatural about this thing, the napkin would keep it at bay.

Dumb, I know, but it made sense at the time.

""I couldn't believe that picture. That's so wild."" Mom was too chipper for this early in the morning. She always was, though. A real 'rise with the early bird' kind of gal.

That wasn't me. I still had bedhead as I sipped my cup of coffee. Parker, another early riser, cooked breakfast. ""I thought so too. Someone told me a company used to go around and paint pictures of homes. They'd ask the homeowners beforehand. Any memory of that?""

""Not that I can remember. Back then, it was mostly your father who spoke with salesmen. I found them unseemly. I can't imagine he'd allow someone to do that, rest his soul.""

""Yeah. Dad was pretty private.""

""We had a neighbor who was a painter, though. Carl, no, that wasn't it. Craig! Craig…aww goddamn my ancient brain. Bonnie, don't get old. It's hell.""

""I'm trying not to. It's why I do my nightly skincare routine.""

""It's intense,"" Parker added with a smirk.

""What was his name? It's been years since I thought of him. Craig…Morris? Something like that. He didn't live near us for long. Dad didn't like him. At all.""

""Why?""

""Craig was the human equivalent of a popcorn kernel stuck in your teeth. Irritating. He rubbed your father the wrong way.""

""I don't remember Dad talking about him.""

""He didn't around you, but with me, hoo boy. Craig used to walk by the house all the time, always whistling 'pop goes the weasel' for some reason. He'd stand too close when he talked to you. He'd leer at me when I was outside hanging laundry on the line. He'd never get the hint that I wanted to be left alone, even though I was always short with him. Especially after he said that you were growing up nicely.""

""Gross,"" I said. ""I was ten.""

""Like I said, he was a weirdo. But, again, most artiste types are, I suppose. Remember your Uncle Walter? Made those ghastly papier mache skulls. They used to be all over his house. Was like walking into some cannibal's hut whenever we'd go over there. But he was good at making them. Who'd want them is another thing altogether. He gave us one, and I made your dad keep it in a bag in the garage. 'Don't bring that ghoulish shit in my house.'""

As my mom rambled about skull shapes like a Victorian phrenologist, a thought came to me. I looked down at the painting and traced the painter's name. ""Mom, could his name have been Craig Moffit?""

Parker looked over at me. I nodded down at the painting and traced what I thought the letters were with my finger. He hit his forehead with the spatula and shook his head.

""OH MY GOD! Yes! That was it! Craig Moffit. God, what a blast from the past. He really was a weird little freak of a man,"" my mom said, laughing. ""He used to wear these tiny little shorts, and he did *not* have the legs for it. Looked like two toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Mom droned on a little longer, but provided nothing of substance beyond Craig Moffit's horrid legs. But she'd given me some new information - the artist's real name. As soon as I hung up, I grabbed my laptop.

""Craig Moffit! Not George! Craig!""

""I see it now,"" Parker said. ""We should've never trusted Marge. Didn't like the cut of her jib.""

""Babe, her jib was flawless,"" I said, turning to the painting. ""Her eyes, not so much.""

""To be fair, we all agreed it was George Moffit….""

""There! There's Craig Moffit!"" I turned the computer around and showed a webpage dedicated to his art. Parker leaned down to get a closer look.

""His legs do look like toothpicks stuck in an orange.""

Rolling my eyes, I turned the laptop back to me and clicked on the man's ""About Me"" page. It was illuminating. Craig had quite the little career. He'd worked for a few newspaper outlets. A few magazines. Some ad campaigns. His stuff was good. There was a list of known works.

""There are a few house paintings listed here. It has to be him.""

""Has anyone mentioned how odd this is?"" Parker said with a sly smile.

""It's catching on.""

""Maybe he saw your home as a happy family home and wanted to capture it for that company. Is there a contact page?""

""There is!"" I yelped. I read the page out loud. ""If you have questions about Craig or his work, please feel free to reach out here,"" I said.

""That's great. You can email him and ask directly.""

""Moffit estate at Moffit art dot com,"" I read. ""Shit. He's dead.""

""That shouldn't matter. Maybe the guy who runs the estate can answer your questions?""

I nodded. It was worth a shot. I started composing a message, and Parker went back to breakfast. I glanced at the artwork on the table next to me. Something about it picked at my brain.

""Hey, I meant to ask, have you been watching professional Wiffle ball games on our YouTube?""

""Oh, yeah. I've started turning on games after your melatonin kicks in. Puts me right out.""

""Uh-huh. Are you a Wiffle ball fan?""

""No,"" I said, laughing. ""I just happened across it one night, and I fell asleep like ten minutes into a game. It's better than ocean waves. Which game was it?""

""Umm, Rhinos against the….""

""Storks? Oh man, those two teams hate each other. Storks have won the last three series behind Dustin Braddock's nasty banana ball…."" I stopped speaking because I could feel Parker's smug smirk on his face. I looked up and caught it with my own eyes. ""Not a fan.""

""What the hell is a banana ball?""

PING!

""They emailed back already,"" I said. ""What the hell?""

""Maybe there isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate?""

""Hi, Craig Moffit was my father. He did several pieces of local homes during that era. I would love to discuss this with you. Can we set up a call?""

""So there clearly isn't a lot going on at the Moffit estate,"" Parker said.

""I'm going to say yes. I think I have to, if for no other reason than my own sanity.""

""Go for it. I can be there for the call if you need me.""

So I set up a call with the estate for later that day. Hopefully, there'd be some information that I could use to stop the itch in my brain. Parker served me breakfast before he got ready to head out to the gym.

""You never told me what a banana ball is,"" he said, placing the plate in front of me.

""It's a side arm slurve. A strikeout pitch. Nearly unhittable if Braddock is on his game."" Parker gave me a quizzical look. I sighed. ""Not a fan.""

After Parker had left for the gym, I went back over to the painting. It was still sitting in the last place I had left it. Still had the napkin over it. The bad vibes I felt earlier were still there. In fact, they'd grown worse. I didn't even want this thing in my house anymore - covered or not.

Despite my misgivings, I pulled the napkin off the painting and gave it a once-over. I felt my stomach gurgle, and my throat went dry. Looking at this now literally caused physical pain. It didn't make sense.

""Where's the front door?"" I suddenly asked myself out loud.

The front door of the house was gone. Blacked out like an actor with perfect teeth coloring in one to look sufficiently destitute for a role. I scraped where the door had been with my thumb. No fresh paint. It was like it had always been that way. But it hadn't. I checked the photo I sent to my mom to confirm.

""What in the….""

There was a creak on the basement stairs. There very much shouldn't have been a creak on the basement stairs. The basement was home to nothing but dust, Christmas decorations, and my ugly childhood couches we didn't have the heart to throw away. Since none of those things can walk, this made no sense.

I tiptoed to the knife block and pulled out a butcher knife. With my phone in my free hand, I used my nimble thumb to unlock it. I was ready to dial 911. But, as I stared at my reflection in the knife blade, I questioned whether I was prepared to stick it into another person. I wouldn't know that until it came to that moment. I very much prayed that wouldn't happen.

Another creak. Near the top of the stairs now. It was getting closer. I flexed the grip on the knife. I tried to control my breathing, but couldn't. Turns out all that woo-woo TikTok relaxation breathing stuff was just bullshit. My heart was thumping like an angry jazz drummer's long-awaited solo. I felt sweat drip down my neck.

Something flickered on the painting. It momentarily took my eyes off the basement door. Like last night, I initially registered nothing different. Then I noticed. Through the window of the living room, it looked like someone had turned on a light or lit a fire. Splotches of yellow and orange paint filled the window frame.

The jingling of the basement door handle snapped me out of my trance. My palms were sweaty. My legs swayed like bamboo in a strong breeze. I gathered all my remaining strength and yelled out, ""Hey! St-stay away from me!"" I wanted to say more, but overwhelming fear shut me up.

The jiggling stopped. Relief. My hectoring worked...for about two seconds. The basement door cracked open. There was a ghostly, pale face staring back at me. That was when my brain firmly decided whether I was a fight-or-flight kinda gal.

I was flight.

""Fuck this."" I dropped the knife, which clattered on the tile like that drummer hitting the high-hat, and sprinted toward my front door. I yelled gibberish the entire time, tears streaming down my face, and blasted out of the door. My fingers hit send on the call, and seconds later, an annoyingly even-keeled 911 operator connected me with the police.

Parker returned home before the police arrived. He found me sitting inside my locked car. Before he could crack a joke, he caught sight of my face. I'd been crying and could feel how puffy my eyes were. Consternation crossed his face. I rolled the window down. ""Get in the car.""

He did. I explained everything to him. He was astonished. He was confused. He grabbed my hand and held it steady as I went over everything, pausing occasionally to sob like a child with a skinned knee. When I was done, he asked why I didn't leave right away.

""Who do you think you are, Rambo?""

I laughed. I need that. ""For a few seconds, I was. Then I wasn't. I wasn't even Gizmo pretending to be Rambo.""

He gave my arm a loving squeeze. ""If it'll help you calm down, we can watch some pro Wiffle ball tonight. I hear the Rhinos are playing the Turkeys.""

""Storks,"" I said, ""but they are actually playing the Habaneros tonight. Gil Faust is looking to debut his 'chili ball' pitch.""

He leaned in and kissed my forehead. ""But you're not a fan.""

""I'm not.""

A knock on the window caused me to scream. The cops had arrived. If they were curious why we were sitting in our car, they kept it to themselves. I relayed what happened, and they said they'd go into the basement and check it out.

Fifteen minutes later, they came walking out. ""We didn't see anyone down there,"" the Cop said. ""But, to be fair to you, your basement gave me the heebie-jeebies.""

""Great,"" I said.

""I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but it's the truth. On the plus side, I haven't seen that love seat since I was a kid.""

""Want it?""

""It's better left to the past. You two have a nice day.""

We watched them leave. Parker turned to me. ""You okay?""

""No, and I won't be until I go into the basement myself.""

""What? Why?""

""I…I can't explain. Something is drawing me there. It sounds crazy, I know, but I feel it in my bones.""

Parker saw the determined look in my eyes. This was going to happen. Had to happen. He sighed. ""Want me to go in first?""

""Yes,"" I said.

""Are you actually going to wait for me to go in or follow right behind me?""

""We both know the answer to that.""

Resuming our reverse waltz, we went back into the house. Once in the kitchen, we stopped near the painting. Parker looked over and agreed that there were changes. We turned our attention to the closed basement door. Parker put his hand on the handle.

""We don't have to go down here, Beth,"" he said. ""The cops didn't find anyone.""

""Alive. If there's a ghost in this house, I need to know. If we know, we can remove it.""

""How?""

""I'm still working on that part,"" I said. ""But I need to know for certain. I won't feel safe otherwise.""

""I'm inclined to just say yes and move on. Something altered the painting already. Who the hell did that?""

""One issue at a time,"" I said.

He knew he couldn't talk his way out of this. He knew I needed this, and he loved me enough to see it through to the end. Even though he was petrified, too. The skin on his arm had goosebumps as soon as we walked into the kitchen. It felt like braille to me now, and the only thing it said was ""let's not do this.""

But that feeling in my brain, the one drawing me down there, wouldn't leave. It was stronger now that we were in the home. Something was loose in my house. I knew it in my heart. Whatever it was, I needed to keep it from roosting in my new home. Let the ghosts live in the past. Leave my future alone.

Parker gripped the handle, sighed so loudly it was heard two towns over, and opened the door. The stairs led down into the dark of the basement. The floor around the landing was the only thing visible. In the abstract, it wasn't anything. Right now, though? Horrifying.

Parker found the light switch, illuminating the rest of the space. So far, so good. We took our time walking down the stairs. Creaking along the wooden one step at a time. Maybe it'd have the same effect on the ghost that hearing creaking steps did on me. Perhaps the phantom was hiding, holding a ghost knife and deciding if it was going to play ghost Rambo or just fearfully disappear into the walls.

""The house in the painting had a basement, too,"" I whispered. ""When I was a kid, I hated going down there. Any time of day. Just didn't feel natural, ya know?""

""Are you trying to get me to stop doing this?""

""Sorry, I'm rambling,"" I said. I kept right on rambling, though. ""What bothered me wasn't so much going down there. What scared me was the trip back up. Turning your back on the dark. I used to walk backwards up the stairs.""

""We can try that in a few minutes,"" Parker whispered back. ""Any other ghost stories you want to share before we hit the landing?""

""Sorry,"" I said. ""It just popped into my mind. I haven't thought about that fear in years. Since we moved away from there, actually.""

""That's not comforting.""

We got to the bottom and took a look around. Everything looked normal. No surprises. Just our old, ugly furniture and friendly Santa decorations smiling and giving us a frozen wave.

I thought about turning and heading back up, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was supposed to be down here. I was also positive Parker would be furious if I went darting up the stairs without him. Leaving him alone in Spook Central might be grounds for divorce.

We headed over to the furniture. There was a layer of dust on everything. I smacked the pillow, sending it flying into the air. I coughed and sneezed, instantly regretting my actions. Parker's withering glare told me he wasn't fond of my actions either.

""Sorry.""

""I don't see anything out of the ordinary here, do you?""

""No,"" I said. ""It looks like it always does.""

""Feeling gone? Can we go back upstairs now?""

Before I could answer, we heard the familiar chime from our security system, followed by the calm, reassuring voice informing us that our front door was open.

""What the fuck?"" I said.

""Shhh,"" Parker responded, his finger to his lips. He pointed up to the ceiling. We cocked our ears and concentrated. For about twenty seconds, there was nothing. Silence. It didn't last.

CREAAAAK.

The floorboards wheezed as someone took slow, deliberate steps above us. You could hear the footfalls as they moved from the front door to the hallway. Trembling, Parker pointed up at the ceiling. You could physically see the floor bow ever so slightly from the person's weight. I didn't even think that was possible.

""W-what do we do?"" I whispered.

""I don't know,"" Parker said. ""Maybe they'll leave?""

A second later, we were cloaked in total darkness. All the power in the house had gone out. The only light came from the sunlight streaming in from the open door at the top of the stairs. It wasn't much, but it was a beacon. Our lighthouse. Our way home.

""Let's…,"" is all I was able to say. Someone upstairs ran down the hall, through the kitchen, and to the basement door. They slammed it shut, plunging us into instant midnight.

I wanted to scream. To yell so loud it'd shake the heavens. But I couldn't. My body physically couldn't make that happen. It'd give away our location. I clutched Parker's shirt so hard I was afraid I'd rip it right off him. If it bothered him, he didn't say.

""This sucks,"" Parker mumbled. Understatement of the goddamn century.

""HO HO HO MERRY CHRISTMAS!"" One of our Santa decorations started going off. I nearly peed myself at Santa's sudden arrival. I imagined it would've been the same response I would've had if I had seen him as a kid.

Kris Kringle was soon joined by all of our Christmas decorations going off at once. Dozens of laughing Santas, lights flickering off and on, inflatables rising like zombified plastic bags. The noise was deafening, but strangely festive. The strobing lights in the pitch black caused afterimages to dance in my rods and cones. I slammed them shut and silently prayed for this all to end.

Someone must've heard because, as quickly as they'd come to life, they stopped.

We stood in the dark, not breathing. Not moving. Neither of us knew what to do. Nothing in my life had prepared me for this. I couldn't shake the idea that whatever was coming would be worse than what we'd already experienced.

There was a creaking again and a sudden rushing of blinding sunlight from the top of the stairs. Someone had opened the door. Before we could get a glimpse, the door slammed shut, and something sprinted down the now-dark stairs.

I pulled Parker back onto the old love seat. We sat on the edge and kept our heads on a swivel, even though the basement was too dark to see our own hands. We weren't alone anymore.

As my fingertips grazed the couch, I realized something. These were originally my parents. My parents got them when I was living in the house from the painting. They were a physical connection between the past and now. Are these what caused my sudden desire to come to the basement? Was I being manipulated by this thing?

Could I trust myself at all?

That dread feeling I'd had since I brought the painting into our house intensified. I felt it in my bones. Deeper even. My aura. My soul.

I leaned into Parker's ear and whispered an apology. He didn't vocalize a response, but squeezed my arm. I squeezed back. My body shook, and I couldn't get myself to stop. I wanted to run for the stairs, but that old fear came rushing back.

I knew if I ran up those stairs, it'd follow behind me.

Something wooshed by us. My hair flowed with it, trailing behind whatever had sprinted past. I nervously dug my fingers into the fabric. We heard the sound of some liquid splattering on the floor across from us. Water? No. Heavier than water. A sound that made my guts twist soon joined the drips and splashes.

Someone started whistling a familiar tune. Pop goes the weasel. The Christmas decorations flickered on and shut off. In the brief flash of light, we could make out a figure standing across from us.

Craig Moffit.

""POP!"" he screamed as the lights strobed.

""GOES!"" he screamed again, a foot closer this time.

""THE!"" Another foot closer. Almost directly in front of us now.

The lights flickered again, and his face was right next to mine. A sinister smile as he slowly whispered, ""weasel."" I felt something wet and slimy rub against my cheek.

Parker stood and, surprisingly, swung at ghost Craig. It didn't find the ghoul, and, as the darkness returned, his fist only found the arm of the couch. I heard his knuckles crack and him swear in pain.

My ears were the only thing working at that moment, though. I sat frozen, tears streaming down my face. The lights in the house came back on, and I screamed.

On the wall across from us, where we had heard the water, the painting was hanging. Only, it wasn't the old house. It was the current house. All the windows and doors were filled with flames. There were two figures on the front lawn. Parker and I. We were both dead. Standing behind our oak tree, watching it all, was Craig Moffit.

""Parker! Let's go!""

I didn't have to tell him twice. We broke for the stairs and took them three at a time until we reached the top. I grabbed the handle and shoved my shoulder into the door, expecting it to hold firm. It didn't. Parker and I spilled onto our kitchen floor.

I scrambled up and practically yanked Parker into the kitchen. I was about to slam the door when I saw Craig Moffit standing at the bottom of the stairs. We locked eyes. My mind flew back to my childhood. A memory stored deep in the folds of my brain. I was sitting on our porch reading a book and heard that damn whistling.

Craig Moffit. A Polaroid camera in his hands and portrait photos on his mind. I was afraid he'd stop and take a picture of me. I was right. Even now, I could hear the heavy clunk of the shutter and the whirring of the processing photo as it slid out. He shook it, and as the fog of war slowly dissipated on the photo, he smiled.

""This way, I won't forget you.""

I slammed the door shut and urged Parker to grab the car keys. He turned the corner to do so when I heard him sharply yelp in surprise, followed by the squeak of his sneakers on the hardwood and his ass hitting the ground. I ran to him expecting to see Craig, but was stunned by the sight of a living man surrounded by two yellow hulks outside my front door.

Once my brain processed the information, it was clear those men were wearing biohazard suits. It still didn't answer why men in biohazard suits were outside my door. But it cleared up that there were. The suitless man in the middle, though, had a more than striking resemblance to the ghost I'd just seen in my basement. Only younger. Fuller. Fleshy.

""Sorry to startle you both,"" the man said, raising his hands in peace. ""You contacted us about a painting you found. I'm David Moffit. Craig was my father.""

""You've got to be shitting me.""

""We were supposed to talk on the phone,"" I said.

""Yes, but we were worried things might have progressed too much by then. Tell me, has the door in the painting disappeared yet?""

""How did….""

David turned to his men. ""Call for the extraction team."" Turning back to us, he urgently asked, ""Where's the painting?""

""The basement,"" I said. ""But it looks different now.""

""What in hell is going on?"" Parker asked.

""Different? Would you say *violently* different?""

""'Our-dead-bodies-on-the-lawn-and-the-place-ablaze' violently different.""

He nervously turned to where the biohazard-suited men had gone. ""The *experienced* extraction team!""

Parker stood and held my hand. We looked at each other and back at David Moffit. We both cracked. Small smiles that turned into chuckles that turned into a laughing fit. I read somewhere that mental breaks can start like this. Whatever. I leaned in.

""David Moffit, the son of your childhood painter neighbor Craig Moffit, himself a ghost that nearly killed us, is standing in our *fucking* veranda,"" Parker said, barely able to get the words out between screeching laughter. ""I mean, what the fuck is this life?""

Seconds later, a team of armed men in hazmat suits carrying unknown machinery rushed in and headed for the basement. We heard one of them scream, and then the sounds of mechanical engines warming up. David nodded toward the front door.

""We should go outside.""

We did. What the hell else were we going to do? Once we were outside, David pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered us one. We both declined. David indulged and nodded back at the house. ""This is the experienced team.""

""What's going on?"" I asked.

""I'm going to level with you. What I'm about to say is pretty weird. I like to say weird to people. Sets the right tone.""

""Sir, on what is easily the weirdest day in not only my and my wife's life, but I'd argue humanity's life, nothing you can say will top what we've already been through,"" Parker said. ""I mean, I just discovered my wife watches professional Wiffle ball, for God's sake!""

""Not a fan,"" I mumbled.

""Dad was a strange man. Lots of demons. When he could keep them at bay, he did great work. But that was never for long. Around the time when you were a kid, he got deep into the occult. It was a faddish passing fancy at first, but soon he found a deeper meaning in it. It consumed him. Around this time, well, he conjured a demon.""

""I think I'm having a stroke.""

""He made a deal. We don't exactly know the details, but what we do know is that Dad agreed to start a company that would paint portraits of people's homes. The twist was that the homes he picked would become targets for the demon.""

""Naturally,"" Parker said. ""Because why not?""

""He'd take a photo of the home and give it to the demon. The demon would curse it and insert it into the canvases of my dad's paintings. These photos would be a connection between the subjects in the art and the demon itself. The pull got stronger when the artwork found its way back to the subjects. Then, they'd, well…."" He trailed off.

""Meet each other?"" I said.

""In a manner of speaking, yes.""

So many questions bounced around my brain. This all sounded so outlandish and yet…. The memory of the photo came back to me. ""This way, I won't forget you,"" I said out loud.

Confused, Parker looked at me. ""What?""

""We don't know how many paintings Dad did during this time, but we've recovered sixty-five in locations from New York to California. The people selected seemed to be random…except for you.""

""Why me?""

""My guess? You were neighbors and, well, my dad really didn't like your dad.""

""The feeling was mutual.""

Just then, the extraction team came rushing out. One was limping. The machines they brought looked broken, but the lights were still on. One of them had the painting in a bio-containment bag. It was smoking.

""The experienced team,"" David said, ashing out his smoke on the bottom of his shoe and pocketing the butt. ""Thank you for letting us help rid you of this…menace. The work is exhausting, but my family has to atone for Craig's wicked actions.""

David nodded and turned to leave. I reached out and grabbed his shoulder. ""Wait, that's it? We're free? Just like that.""

""Just like that,"" he said, turning to leave. He stopped and spun on his heels. ""Unless you have something from the old house in your new house. Then you kinda sorta leave a backdoor for the demon to return. So, if you do, I suggest destroying it."" He tipped his cap and left.

Parker and I locked eyes. ""The fucking love seat,"" we said at the same time. My back hurt just thinking about hauling it up those narrow stairs.

Later that night, we torched the sofa in a makeshift fire pit in our backyard. We ate pizza and watched the flames consume the potentially demonic couch. Can't imagine that's a sentence that's been said a lot in history. As we did, relief filled my heart. The dread was gone. I looked over at Parker and smiled.

""I think we can put to bed the argument about who had the weirder childhood, Park.""

He laughed. ""Yeah, summers with my Amish family can't compete with demons."" His phone buzzed. He looked down at the notification with concern. I felt my stomach twist.

""Please tell me it's good news.""

""The Rhinos/Habaneros game is about to start. I set a reminder. Wanna watch?""

I touched my heart and felt pure happiness surge through me. Tears. Grabbing his free hand, I held it tight and gave it a big squeeze. ""I have something to confess,"" I said. ""I think I'm a legitimate fan of professional Wiffle ball.""

""I know, babe. I know.""

We sat together, letting the crackling of a burning demon couch and the crack of a Wiffle ball bat fill the night air. I snuggled into Parker's shoulder. It was warm. Inviting. Home…and not one haunted by an angry ghost.

We've been a un-problematic trio for a few years now. For the past 6 months, things have been weird I guess. I'm not sure why this has been happening, but for some reason every time I tell them I'm doing something, either one of them but usually both of them have a problem with it. To be fair to them they don't say it rudely, but it feels almost condescending. They don't do it to each other and I don't do it to them. So I don't understand why they question all my choices. I also included the reason I made the choices, cause I told them the reasoning for all these and they (mostly) stuck by what they said

Here's some examples of things they've been concerned about 

- me getting snakebites: they asked if I was going through a mental crisis, which I wasnt I just always wanted the piercings (I got them and love it btw) they didnt say much about them after I got them

- me desperately wanting a new job: they keep implying that I'm ruining my life basically by getting a new one, but cant explain why they think so 

- getting a nicer apartment: my old one was pretty bottom of the barrel. I got an income restricted apartment thats much nicer and both of them were mad. Said I was being stupid with money and neither helped me move. (Its an INCREDIBLE apartment with all the amenities, but about $200 more than my shit ass old one) They used to come over like 1-2 times a week, but its been over a month and neither has visited my new one :(

- buying a coffee table: insisted I could get one at a thrift store, but I've been looking for the past year and really hated all the ones I'd seen. I ended up buying one and I love it and neither said anything about it..

- taking edibles: I do it super infrequently (twice a month) but its a fun social thing with other friends, or it helps me sleep. They said doing it at all means I have a problem (one of them vapes and takes edibles often though, which makes me more confused) NONE of my other friends think I have a problem or anything close to an addiction 

- using dating apps: yeah they suck but damn it'd be nice to find love idk

- not wanting something casual: they think its unrealistic snd dont understand that I dont like that 

- having a crush on a guy whos 24, I turn 21 in like 2 months: they said the age gap is too big and that its concerning, said I was basically getting groomed. But when that crush faded and my new one is a woman whos 24, it's completely fine?

- shaving my head: I did it with my friend, because his mom has cancer. I didnt want him to do it alone. They retracted the hate a little when I told them that but it was clear they didnt like the look

- getting a second part time gig to save money for college: said I would be overworked and I dont need the money (I really do tho)

I talked to another good friend of mine whos not in the same friend circle. He told me it sounds like they are jealous of me having anything good happen. But I feel like that cant be it? We've been friends for so long I dont understand why'd theyd be upset at me being happy. When I talked to both of them, they told me they were just looking out for me. It feels scrutinizing at times though and I'd really just like some support. 

I've had arguments with them separately and together about stuff like this and they always double down. Its honestly making me feel like I'm a bad person. Are my decisions really that bad? How should I talk to them about this again? Or if I'm the problem here please lmk",2,1752382107.0,FriendshipAdvice,3,1.0,False

Current setup: I have a French press, which I use with pre-ground coffee.

Considerations: I looked into the Costar 3 in 1 machine and the DeLonghi EC685. I am okay with any options. My main criterion is good coffee with a good machine which doesn't give me too many problems in running.

I remember us meeting in college during an ""Intro to Education"" class; we both were interested in becoming teachers. You had suggested others to call you ""Dice"" since they struggled with your real name when you were in America. As a fellow college student who had been to Japan as an exchange student years prior though, that hardly ever crossed my mind. So I confidently used your full name, and we became quick friends. We talked a lot about being in a different country and getting used to immersing oneself into the language and culture of that country; how overwhelming and tiring it can be emotionally and mentally. We could really relate to each other. I mentioned how much I appreciated when friends in Japan would speak English with me, to feel a sense of home, so I spoke in Japanese with you as much as I could to bring you that comfort as well. You thanked me for doing that and for all of my help throughout your time here. I was happy to help you and to find a friend in you. As we grew closer, I'll admit I wouldn't have minded if it had been more. You were always such a kind and caring man.

For one of our last projects in class, we both signed up to teach mock lessons on the same day, I did one about singing, and you did one on Japanese culture. 

One day we were messaging back and forth, talking about homework and studying for finals. I jokingly asked for your help, and you said that you wished you were Superman. Do you know how much that made my heart melt? 🥰

We occasionally got together, just the two of us as friends...often drinking coffee at some coffee shop and talking about almost anything and everything. We laughed a lot, and made some great memories. I helped you find some gifts to bring back to your family in Japan, and you came to a concert that I sang at and sang my praises, calling me the nickname ""Singer (my real name)."" I opened up about how I was adopted at birth and how it's a cause that I'm passionate about, and you found it fascinating, but said that it is sadly fairly unusual in Japan. One time, we were having coffee as usual while chatting and laughing. I went to give you a high-five and instead of a simple high-five, you lightly grasped my hand for a moment...midair...like in some sort of anime. I was so confused, but didn't press the issue. I've never liked how curvy I am, and figured it was still just a friendly gesture. Over time, as we each pursued our bachelor's degrees, we grew apart, which part of me regrets. Then again, maybe I was reading too much into things. I almost messaged you tonight for the first time in years. とても難しいですね。(It's very difficult.) I wish you well and I wish you happiness. 

This letter will likely never find you, and under the anonymity of Reddit, I feel comfortable sharing this. As always, 頑張ってね！(Always try your best!) And yes, I'm still goofy enough to fake falling asleep behind the wheel at a stoplight. 🤣 Thanks for the laughter and the memories.

Learned a few things about politics and gambling.,"*Pls don't post on other social media channels, i dont want it to be traced back to me haha*

I knew that my son's friend came from a rich family, but I never expected that he's royalty rich. The party had around 60 to 80 people. Family, friends, and classmates were invited. I felt a bit out of place, but okay lang, I was there for my kid. He was having a blast. Still, it was a good party. May games, may performances, and even games for old titos like me. The food was really good, not your typical buffet style. It honestly felt like eating at a restaurant owned by the Abaca Group.

The party ended around 8 PM. Everyone left, but my son was still playing with the birthday boy (10yrs old). He got invited to their family's villa, which was walking distance from the venue. I was hesitant at first since it was getting late. But the mom approached me, introduced me to her husband, and they were both super warm. I've seen them in my son's school events once or twice but never really had the chance to talk. The husband was really friendly and charming. He convinced me to stay and chill for a bit.

When we got to the villa, nandun rin yung ibang relatives nila and it feels like another party is starting, he offered me something to drink. He was mixing alcohol for himself but assured me it was just for him. He offered me coffee or soda. Then we started talking. He shared that he's an importer of raw materials from China. He saw an opportunity in the province we're in, went to China, made an investment, and it turned out great. The way he told the story, it didn’t feel like he was bragging, just sharing his journey. I think he's just 5 years older then me. I couldn’t imagine the risks he took. He made it sound like it was a mix of luck, timing, and hard work. Really inspiring stuff. Something I honestly can’t imagine doing in my lifetime.

He also mentioned that some of his friends are grooming him to run for congressman in that area. He talked about his plans okay naman, normal things that can help the community. But I was surprised when the topic of pork barrel came up. He said it’s actually a great source of extra income or, as he called it, ""dry powder for the next election."" He said the usual cut from pork barrel is around 15% to 30%. Sayang din daw yun. I asked him if he was serious about running, and he said he’s still studying it with his team.

We also talked about Atong Ang and the dead sabongeros. He said those sabongeros were cheating the system. Fixing the results of online sabong and betting on the pre agreed winners. Apparently, one of the sabongeros from that group snitched (maybe may tampuhan or nagkadayaan din). He reported it to the boss, and now they’re all dead. He mentioned it casually, saying, ""If you're a bad guy, never mess with the devil"".

It was a surreal night. Fun conversation. I was laughing on the way home because all I really said the whole time was ""ah ganun ba,"" ""grabe naman,"" since it was the first time I heard stories like that, i couldn't add anything to the conversation. But he didn't seem to mind that. I shared a bit about our small business too the problems we’ve experienced but it was nothing compared to his stories. ",294,1752381843.0,Philippines,66,0.91,False

I first recognized him working in a cafe as the same guy I matched with on bumble, months ago (I deleted the app and we lost contact). I brought up that he looked familiar and he didn’t say anything…when it clicked and I said we matched on bumble, he said oh haha yeah you’re (my name). Sign number one he’s not interested; he recognized me from bumble but didn’t say anything.

I didn’t think anything of it, I assumed it was a funny coincidence and that was that. Then, his coworkers (the cafe is a minute walk from where I work so I go there on my breaks), started saying stuff like “oh are you D’s friend? 👀” which I thought was random…then another worker said “oh you know your friend D mentioned you haha 😉” and another time “oh he’s working this Saturday, you should come, it’ll be fun” so I thought oh maybe he has a crush on me? Or maybe his coworkers were just trying to set us up? 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

I went that Saturday and he was nice but didn’t ask for my number or anything, and I just felt kinda stupid. The next time I went, he was chatting with me and I figured he’s just being polite, it’s a customer service job, but then he pulled me aside to talk and asked for my number and seemed kinda nervous and mentioned a concert so I was like oh I think he’s asking me to go?

He wasn’t like “oh I’ll take you out to this concert” it was more like “yeah there’s a concert so you can come if you’d like, no pressure!” So we went and I felt more of a friend vibe coming from him, he kinda brushed of my one pathetic attempt at a flirt (he asked which band member I thought was cutest and I said I dunno I’m kinda more focused on the guy next to me :) and he did that playful shoulder punch friends do), so I was like oh ok it’s more of a friends hanging out thing than a date 🤷🏼‍♀️ sometime after that, when I went to the cafe one worker (a girl about my age) was all giggly and asked if I was his girlfriend so I dunno what the hell’s going on behind the scenes

I mentioned wanting to go out and he wanted to as well but then he’s busy or we never set up a date…after a week or so of no advancing I came out and said “hey I think you’re cute, wanna get a drink?” And he said he was flattered but tbh I don’t know you well yet, I can’t promise anything; if you’re ok with taking things slow, I’d be happy to keep spending time together…do you wanna go for dinner or just grab some coffee and walk around?” 

I took that as a polite rejection, even though he offered dinner and stuff, he’d already been saying that for the past couple weeks and when I asked “yeah great when?” nothing was ever set up so I figured ok this is him just politely turning me down….

So I texted him “it’s ok I understand, good luck with everything” because at this point I feel bad I’ve just made this guy uncomfortable and I’m embarrassed thinking he’d like me. I wanted to give him a chance to back out and be honest instead of just being polite, because as a chronic people pleaser I understand how hard it is to turn down someone you’ve expressed interest in.

But then, he responded with “I might have free time next week if you’re up for it, no pressure, just let me know”, I said “I’d be down but I kinda got the vibe you weren’t into me? 😅” but he said he was surprised by my “forwardness”, he’s more slow-paced, I’m not used to the dating culture here, I was a bit confused at first, I’m sorry haha but I’m definitely into you and I’d really like to hang out more!”

So my question is, if he’s saying he definitely into me and wants to hang out more but then never makes concrete plans…what’s up? Is he just being polite and too passive to say no? Is this just a cultural thing? I’d appreciate any help or advice, thank you. ",2,1752381636.0,AskAJapanese,11,0.75,False

One mistake, one compromise—so began the tale of a lifetime…


---

Part 1: A Mistaken Identity

It was an ordinary day—no special expectations, no excitement. I had gone to the local market for household errands: groceries, toothpaste, washing powder, and a new shampoo that mom had asked for. I hopped on my scooty without planning, unaware that today would entirely alter my life’s course.

The market buzzed with the usual crowd. People hurried past, vendors called out loudly. I entered the general store where I often shopped. As I looked around, I saw her—wearing a white top, jeans, and a ponytail with a few rebellious strands escaping. She stood by a shelf, holding an empty shopping basket, looking confused.

I began picking out my items. Then I heard her voice:
""Brother, where’s the Surf Excel? These guys really don’t organize.""

I paused. “Brother?” She was addressing me. I walked over and casually said, “Ma’am, I don’t work here.”

She stared for a moment, eyes widening. “Oh god! I’m so sorry. I thought you were staff… don’t know why.”

I smiled. “It’s okay—it happens. Surf Excel is on the second shelf.”

She laughed with embarrassment and said, “Thank you… and sorry again.”

Something clicked in that moment—perhaps her shy smile or the honest apology. I sensed something different about the encounter.

I paid for my items and headed out. She checked out too. When we stepped outside, she approached me.
""Actually, I should treat you—it’s my fault."" Her tone was sincere. “If you’re free, how about a coffee?”

I don’t normally open up to strangers, but something made me agree. “Alright—and next time, don’t mistake me for staff,” I joked.


---

Part 2: From Treat to Connection

She led me to a cozy café. We ordered coffee and a pastry. As we talked, I learned she studied at a nearby college. She was friendly, quirky, calm—everything she said carried an innocent charm.

I intentionally didn’t ask her name, and she didn’t reveal it either. I liked that small mystery—so in this story, we’ll just call her “her.”

She mentioned shopping because her mom was busy. I felt that this ordinary shopping trip was giving fate a little twist.

After coffee, she thanked me and we parted ways. But as we left, she said, “Should we exchange numbers? Maybe I’ll make the same mistake again.”

Thus began a string of messages: memes, my trading tips, her college anecdotes, my boring office stories.


---

Part 3: Feelings Deepening

One day she messaged, “I want to discuss something personal. Free this evening?”

Curiously, I agreed. When we met, she revealed there was family pressure—talks of marriage with a relative’s son. But she didn’t feel ready.

I said, “Listen to your heart. If it doesn’t feel right, it isn’t.”

She nodded. Then asked, “If you were in my place, what would you do?”

It wasn’t a casual question. I smiled softly. “I’d probably do the same—listen to my heart.”


---

Part 4: Trading Together

I began teaching her trading—candlesticks, support-resistance, market strategies. Watching her eyes concentrate and try to understand made it feel like I wasn’t just a teacher—I was part of her world.

One day, she messaged with exciting news: her first self-made trade was profitable. “See? I can do it too!” she cheered.

I thought, this is it—the person who takes me seriously, who wants to be part of my life.


---

Part 5: The Manali Trip

Before college resumed, we planned a small trip to Manali—snow, mountains, just the two of us. It was tricky to convince our parents, but we managed. I booked a 4-star hotel and arranged a car. She wore a mustard-yellow hoodie and blue jeans. Simplicity shines the brightest.

On the road, she stared out the window at the mountains. Sometimes she held my hand. “Some of these turns scare me,” she said.

When we reached the hotel, the staff offered us a balcony room. We were exhausted, had dinner, and fell asleep instantly.

At 2 a.m. her frightened whisper jolted me awake: “Spider! Spider!”

I saw a tiny spider on her blanket, gently removed it, and reassured her: “It’s okay—you’re safe.”

She closed her eyes and rested her head on my shoulder. “Thank you… when you’re here, everything feels manageable.”


---

Part 6: The Temple Moment

The next day we visited a temple. The priest assumed we were a married couple and began blessing us. We blushed and corrected him: “We’re just friends.”

But he smiled and replied, “Your connection feels like marriage. Maybe it’s fated.”

That moment conveyed something new.


---

Part 7: Surprise Awaiting

At the end of the trip, as I was dropping her home, I learned her family had come to visit. The topic: marriage. We were shocked—but strangely at peace, as if someone else had already seen the bond we felt.

Life changed after Manali. College resumed, schedules resumed—but something deeper was building. We grew closer. I taught her trading; she took interest—not just in the lessons, but in my world.

Then came winter holidays. Our families planned a combined trip to a hilltop temple. They didn’t disclose the destination—just said to be ready for a peaceful, spiritual journey. When we reached, it was cold, yet both our faces glowed.

Inside the temple stood a priest I instantly recognized—it was the same priest from Manali! He acknowledged us with a smile:
“You came again… now it’s time for real blessings.”

We humbly confirmed, “We’re still just friends.”

But he nodded: “Doesn’t feel that way. And when you’re married, come back for another blessing.”


---

Part 8: An Evening to Remember

Back at the hotel later that night, the staff—who remembered us as their favorite couple—welcomed us again. They joked: “Feels like you’ve already gotten married—couples always return like this after their honeymoon.”

We laughed, told them otherwise, but they responded: “Well, vibes say otherwise.”

After dinner, an unmistakable atmosphere followed us. It felt like a small bell ringing inside both of us: “Blessings received—time to understand what’s happening.”

In the room, she slipped into a sky-blue nightdress. I wore simple lounge clothes. We didn’t speak; the silence spoke everything.

She went out to the balcony. I quietly approached, embraced her waist. She didn’t resist. Her hair fluttered in the breeze; moonlight danced around her. Her soft perfume drew me closer.

“I thought... you’d say something more...” I whispered.

She smiled softly: “Sometimes… silence says more.”

I moved closer. “When you’re near, everything stops.”

She placed her hand over mine. Held it tight.

The world around us froze. I lifted her and placed her on the balcony swing. We sat, cuddled—her head resting on my shoulder, my arm around her.

“I’m scared…” she whispered.

“Of what?” I asked gently.

“Of everything ending…” her voice quivered.

I held her face in my hands and looked into her eyes. “I’m here… everything will be fine as long as I’m here.”

She had tears; her lips held a soft smile. She hugged me tight. We moved to the bed—she rested her head on my hand just like in Manali.

She held onto me all night long. I just thought—“May this night never end…”.

Part 9: Morning Surprise

Around 7:30 A.M., a knock sounded on the door. I was awake; she was still asleep, her head on my hand. My hand, numb from holding her—I thought, “This hand woke up love today.”

The door opened. Both our moms and dads stood there. They saw us in our cocoon and taken a candid photo.

We opened our eyes to smiling faces. Her dad teased: “You two seem to have a license to cling.”

She buried herself in the pillow. I awkwardly rubbed my hands and stood up. Laughter filled the room.

After freshening up, we went for breakfast. The hotel staff greeted us: “Good morning, sir and ma’am... You looked adorable last night.”


---

Part 10: Sari Scene

She wore a peach-colored silk sari—soft and elegant—with a backless blouse. She struggled with the pallu and shamed politely, “Could you help?”

I walked over, arranged her pallu and pinned it on her shoulder. Just then, our moms entered. Their reaction: shock followed by smiles.

“See? They’ve already become husband-wife,” her mom said.

“When a husband sets his wife’s sari, there’s a different kind of love in it,” my mom said.

She blushed and went to the dressing room. I realized that everyone now believed we truly belonged together.


---

Part 11: Evening Confirmations

That evening at dinner, a family friend couple asked: “So when’s the wedding? Engagement news will come tomorrow, right?”

Laughter echoed around the table. Both of us just smiled at each other. Her parents whispered: “Consider it finalized.”

We remained quiet, but our eyes said it all.

After dinner, standing on the balcony, she said:
“I guess we’ve truly become the heroes and heroines of our own story.”

I held her hand: “Are you ready to write this story with me—for life?”

She nodded silently and hugged me.


---

Part 12: Emotional Intimacy

That night she hugged me tightly and whispered: “Don’t leave me tonight... I’m scared.”

I lifted her in my lap, kissed her forehead. She closed her eyes: “Tonight, just make me feel—don’t speak.”

We fell asleep holding each other; that night, words weren’t needed.


---

Part 13: The Ring Ceremony

Later that night, the hotel lawn was lit softly, with a decorated table awaiting our small ring ceremony. Our parents, a few friendly travelers, and hotel staff gathered.

I was dressed in white kurta-pajama. She wore a peach-pink lehenga that her mom had specially chosen.

When she appeared, time seemed to stop. Her shy smile and glimmer in her eyes spoke everything. She moved forward, and the same temple priest—now a hotel guest—blessed us.

“Whether childhood friends or new couples, this match seems made by God. Tonight is just a ring—but soon you’ll bind the mangalsutra too.”

Everyone laughed. I slid the ring onto her finger. Tears glistened in her eyes.
“I never imagined it’d become this real, so fast,” she whispered.

“Neither did I—but maybe it’s finally time,” I said softly, holding her hand.

There was applause. Then, she put a ring on my finger—tight enough that she said, “Now you can't run away!” causing laughter again.

We danced a slow dance under the starlight with chai, snacks, and soft music.

“This moment—I want to freeze it,” she murmured.

“Forever,” I replied.

That night wasn’t just a ceremony—it was a new chapter where our relationship wasn’t a label, but an emotion. No official confirmations were needed; our families had already understood.

The next day, planning for engagement and wedding began. Invitations were designed and printed within a week. Everyone said, “The real ceremony is next; this was just the trailer.” But we both knew—the magic began much earlier.


---

Part 14: Marriage & Farewell

A month later, the engagement ceremony took place. Our home was adorned with lights and flowers; the terrace became a banquet space. Friends and family, joyous laughter, and sweets everywhere.

I stood in my sherwani, nervous yet excited. When she arrived in a golden blouse and red lehenga, kajal in her eyes, mehendi on her hands—I felt like the world had paused.

We took the stage together, held hands publicly. The priest said a mantra, and we exchanged rings. She softly whispered: “I’m officially yours now.” I replied, “I’ve been yours long ago.”

There were claps, cake cutting, heartfelt emotional tears—from both sets of families.

Two days later, the wedding date was set.
“Finish everything quickly, because this marriage is already in hearts,” my mom said.


---

Part 15: Wedding Day & Farewell

On the wedding day, I got ready with friends—golden sherwani, red safa, with a nervous grin. It still amazed me that the girl I had mistakenly thought was store staff was now my bride.

Under a flower canopy, she walked toward me—face hidden behind her dupatta. We exchanged calm glances.

With the seven vows, we pledged together. I put the mangalsutra, and as she applied sindoor, tears came—joy entwined with a poignant farewell.

At the bidaai, as she hugged her mother and said, “I’m leaving... but I’ll always stay in your heart,” I couldn't hold back tears either. Resting her head on my shoulder, we embarked together—toward a new journey.


---

Part 16: Honeymoon in Shimla

The next day, we left for Shimla—the place we dreamed of playing in the snow. We stayed in a charming wooden cottage with a fireplace and snowy windows. With mugs of warm coffee in hand, we sat on the balcony. She said, “I never thought my honeymoon could be this perfect.”

I held her hand: “I’m here; I’ll make everything perfect.”

It was cold outside, but our conversations were warm. We laughed, had snowball fights, wrapped ourselves in each other’s arms.

That evening, we had a candlelit dinner with soft music. Dancing slowly, she rested her head on my chest and said, “I want every moment of my life with you.”


---

Part 17: Temple of Eternal Blessing

At the end of the honeymoon, we returned to the same temple where we first met the priest who blessed us twice. He greeted us warmly:
“You’ve come back... now please receive the blessings as husband and wife.”

He prayed for us again and said, “May no force ever break the depth of your relationship. Go now, walk together for life.”


---

Part 18: Return Home & Traditions

Two days later, we returned home. Both families greeted us with hugs. When asked about the honeymoon, we smiled and stayed humble.

Then came the rituals—homewarming, first-time cooking in the new home, and other small ceremonies. Every tradition now had her name attached.

She was no longer just my partner—she was my entire life. A friend, companion, and a secret I had stumbled upon—a love I found by mistake, but embraced wholly.


---

And that, my friend, is our story—a misunderstanding that led to a lifelong connection. Real love begins from mistakes and grows into partnerships—and ours is a testament to that.

The End... but truly, it’s just the beginning.

I’m just having trouble with thinking of the best layout as he does want to fit a fair bit into the space such as - a chesterfield couch (or similar), an armchair, a display case/bookshelf & TV. 

I’m thinking of putting the tv on the back wall (bathroom wall) to the right of the door, with it on a bracket so it can be pulled out. Display case/bookshelf behind the stairs on the left side of the bathroom door. Then I’m kind of stuck with the lounge & armchair. Lounge in front of the window? But then it blocks most of the window. So I’m thinking maybe two big armchairs, no lounge? Then pop a coffee table & rug down too. Rough layout of the room included. 

For colour, I need something that will suit the bathroom tile but I want something dark & then I don’t know if I should do the skirting boards & window trims as well or leave them white. Also, should I do the ceiling for extra warmth? The colour I’m thinking is included but the site I used paints the tiles too so I can’t quite pick up on the full look. & it doesn’t do ceilings.

1lyk1nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1lyk1nw/caught_the_cafe_manager_secretly_filming_me_at/,Caught the Cafe Manager Secretly Filming Me at the Urinal!,"M32, foreigner. This happened back in March 2025 and I haven’t told anyone except my girlfriend (who’s local). Of course, the whole cafe found out when I exploded and confronted the guy, but I never got the police involved and haven’t mentioned it again since that Sunday night.

So… this happened at a cafe I used to go to often. After closing up my small tiệm bánh / Italian street food takeaway spot around 9pm, I’d usually head there to chill because it’s open 24hrs and there’s no pressure to leave.

I don’t know what made me look up while peeing at the urinal, but I did and saw a mobile phone on top of what seemed to be a small electrical box on the wall. I initially thought “why would someone charge their phone up there…” and then it immediately dawned on me that the phone could be recording a video. There were no charging cables or outlets either, just the phone hanging off the edge, exposed camera lenses facing down toward the urinal and myself, taking a glorious piss after drinking two coconuts at the end of a long day.

Before entering the toilet, I actually stopped and decided to pay the bill. The perv who planted the phone saw me heading towards the toilets, then diverting to the counter to pay. First he was going to assist me with the payment. Then he called a waitress to do it and he disappeared. But something about the way he stared at me felt off. He locked eyes with me for a little too long…like he was seeing a unicorn or something. It was weird. I came here often, it was definitely not the first time he saw me. That made it feel even more off. But I ignored the feeling. I just wanted to pay, piss, and go home.

When I got to the toilet, someone was already inside. So I waited. That same guy was the one who walked out. This time, he looked anxious and paused as he noticed me, before walking out and even politely ushered me inside, still wouldn’t stop staring at me like he mê my appearance or something. It seemed as if he was just being polite but my intuition was like “brah this guy wants something from you”.

Anyway. I go in, start doing my business, and boom, I look up and I see the phone. You can literally hear me say “da fvck??” in the video I ended up recovering. Yes, I have the video. You can’t see his face, but you can clearly see him setting the phone up carefully, making sure it’s pointed properly. Then he flushes the urinal (without using it), opens the door, and before walking out, he pauses, stares at me one more time and then leaves. That moment is in the video. Right before I enter and get caught on camera, chim out, doing my business and all 🦅 

As soon as I grabbed the phone and discovered it was recording, adrenaline kicked in. Stopped the recording (I wish I had left it running), and quickly airdropped the video to my own phone. My hands were shaking. Rage was building. And guess what? As I left the bathroom, the guy was waiting outside, with a mop and bucket of water pretending like he was going to clean the floors.

I washed my hands, walked straight back to my seat, avoided eye contact and kept a poker face. I wanted more evidence. I wanted to be 100% sure before confronting him. I kept his phone with me.
Sure enough, less than 1min, he walked to my seat and in a timid, high-pitched voice asked me for his phone back. He knew exactly who had it. (I should have kept recording and then filmed him walking back to me and got his face on camera all in one uncut clip, but I couldn’t think straight obviously)

That’s when I exploded.

The whole cafe froze. I stood up and started shouting, “mày đang làm gì!!! mày quay video của tao hả???” over and over. I was angry, and with my limited Vietnamese I couldn’t say all I wanted to, but it was enough for everyone to know something messed up had happened.

I started showing the video to the waitresses (don’t worry, I paused it before my wand of wonder 🪄made an appearance). I had to show someone. I felt helpless, because I couldn’t explain myself properly. And then I found out the worst part… this biến thái was the manager of the cafe.

A local couple with their two dogs was sitting nearby and the woman could speak English, she called me over, so I explained everything and showed them the clip. She confronted the guy. His excuse? He said he was taking a “hidden video” in the bathroom to see if staff were cleaning it properly.

What BS excuse is that? 

I didn’t contact the police. After that night, I tried to forget it. But for some reason, today it all came back and clouded my mind. So I decided to post the story here. I know I’ve been making a couple jokes in this story because I do find it funny now but at the time it wasn’t fvcken funny at all.

Should I leave a review and include the censored video and photo of him? The place is called Rich Coffee on Trần Văn Kiểu Street in Quận 6. Or should I just let it go?

There was a moment where I was seconds away from smashing his face in. I’m not a big guy, but I’ve got high testosterone, unapologetic masculine energy, I hit the gym every day… his weak little frame would’ve needed months to recover if I let the animal out. I’m sure anyone reading can understand how something like this could bring the demons out of you..

I’m glad I didn’t do that, it would not have worked out in my favour. I learnt that in VN if you defend yourself from a violent attack, even life-threatening, and happen to physically harm the attacker, you’ll be punished by law which is beyond my understanding but anyways, in this case I was not being attacked so would’ve been in the wrong regardless. 

What would you do?

TL;DR

In March 2025, I caught a pervert (who turned out to be the manager) secretly recording me at a urinal in a Saigon cafe. I found his phone hidden above the urinal, recording me, confronted him, and showed the evidence to others. He claimed he was “monitoring staff.” I didn’t involve police but still have the footage and photo of him. Wondering if I should post a public review with proof or just let it go.

About me: I’m kind shy and an introvert, but past that, you’ll find some that’s funny, caring, kind to others, romantic, and who is always there to listen.

""Get the OR ready. Remove her womb. Make sure it’s done before she wakes.""  
  
The pack healer went rigid with shock.  
  
""Alpha... Remove her womb?!""  
  
""Alpha—you don't have an heir! You do this, the pack will have no heir. The pack elders will never accept it!""  
  
Cassian's voice was ice-cold, devoid of emotion.  
  
""I don’t need an heir from Evelyn Carter. Annabelle delivered my heir yesterday. He will inherit everything. Evelyn’s womb is a threat.""  
  
The healer's face crumpled with disbelief.  
  
""But that boy will carry another man's name, call another man Alpha. After seven miscarriages, The chances of Luna carrying another are barely there.""  
  
Cassian lit a cigarette, his voice bitter.  
  
""Annabelle is my true mate, I’d do anything for her, I don't care some Moon Goddess pairing.""  
  
""Alpha, but—""  
  
""Enough."" He frowned. ""Do it.""  
  
Just as Cassian got up to go, his phone buzzed. He hit speaker by mistake.  
  
""Alpha, got the cash. Hell, after seven jobs, I could do this shit in my sleep. Next time, I’ll wear a vampire disguise—really carve up that Luna's belly—""  
  
""No next time. Take your money and disappear from Moonvale.""  
  
Footsteps approached from deeper inside.  
  
I stumbled back to my room, barely making it to the bed before Cassian entered.  
  
""Evelyn, you're up. When did you wake up?""  
  
Sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to appear normal.  
  
""Just woke up. You weren't here, so I thought I'd stretch my legs.""  
  
His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face.  
  
My wolf whimpered with terror. Just when I thought he'd caught me, he scooped me up and settled me back on the bed.  
  
""Baby, you scared the hell out of me. We already lost our pup—I can't handle losing you too.""  
  
He dared to mention our pup.  
  
Thinking of all the puppies he'd murdered, I pressed a hand to my chest as grief threatened to overwhelm me.  
  
Those accidents, the attacks, the fall—all of it orchestrated by my own mate.  
  
""The heal needs to do a follow-up procedure. Just to make sure everything's healing properly.""  
  
""I know losing the baby hurts, but we'll try again. We'll have the most beautiful pup—strong like their Alpha, gentle like their mother.""  
  
Cassian handed me a vial of potion. In the brief moment he turned away, I saw a thick, dark liquid shimmer as something else mixed in and vanished.  
  
He pulled me close, his expression soft with false concern.  
  
But I could see through the mask now. Every gentle touch was a lie.  
  
""Do I really need to drink this? I'm not very thirsty...""  
  
Cassian, you've slaughtered seven of my children. Now you want to steal my very ability to be a mother?  
  
He didn't even pause, stroking my hair with that practiced tenderness.  
  
""Come on, don't be difficult. You need your strength to heal. You want your Alpha to worry himself sick?""  
  
""Let me help you with that.""  
  
He pressed the glass to my lips, his grip firm enough that refusal wasn't an option.  
  
I closed my eyes, each swallow feeling like liquid fire burning down my throat.  
  
As the drugs took hold, I saw the healer slip into the room through my blurring vision.  
  
""Begin immediately. And...""  
  
Cassian's voice dropped to barely a whisper.  
  
""Make sure she can’t walk again.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Alpha, is this really necessary? Isn’t that… a little too cruel?""  
  
""Do it!""  
  
I knew Cassian was always calculating and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me awake early would push him to such cruelty.  
  
My puppy, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to walk—he was taking everything.  
  
Cassian, is this how you treat the mate the Moon Goddess chose for you?  
  
My wolf howled inside me, wild and silent with fury.  
  
I screamed silently in despair, struggling to sit up, but the darkness pulled me deeper.  
  
As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the healer's voice through the haze:  
  
""Alpha, her womb has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""  
  
Cassian's voice was filled with satisfaction. ""Good. Perfect.""  
  
When I fully awakened, tears were falling onto my hands—his tears, so convincingly real.  
  
""Evelyn, the healer says infection damaged your womb. You'll never be able to have children.""  
  
I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.  
  
Nothing. No sensation at all.  
  
I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded:  
  
""Cassian, what did you do to my legs?""  
  
Tears streamed down his face, his voice breaking with practiced grief.  
  
""There were complications with the anesthesia. You're paralyzed from the waist down.""  
  
""Don't be scared, baby... no matter what happens, I'll never leave you. I'll always love you.""  
  
I'd never realized what a gifted actor my mate was.  
  
He dismissed the nurses, personally feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even tending to the post-surgical bleeding himself.  
  
He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.  
  
""You've suffered so much for our pack. I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""  
  
I studied his exhausted face, then looked away coldly.  
  
""You should rest if you're tired.""  
  
""I'll stay right here with you. Just call if you need anything.""  
  
Once he was asleep, I reached for his second phone.  
  
I'd always known about Cassian's other device—his ""work phone""—but had never thought to check it.  
  
The password worked on the first try.  
  
Annabelle's birthday.  
  
The lock screen showed their wedding photo.  
  
A wedding photo... He'd married her in secret. The white dress seared my eyes.  
  
With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. He called her ""baby"" in every text.  
  
Endless conversations that grew more horrifying with each scroll.  
  
Every business trip had been a lie—excuses to be with her.  
  
All those times I'd been hurt that he never came to my doctor appointments.  
  
When physicians asked about the Alpha, I'd smile awkwardly and say he was busy with Alpha duties.  
  
His standard response was always the same:  
  
""I’ve been tied up with pack affairs. Check-ups aren't a big deal—I'd just be in the way. You can handle routine things yourself.""  
  
But he'd attended every single one of Annabelle's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy, he never missed one.  
  
He wrote about how excited he was for their child, calling them the most precious thing in his world.  
  
Scrolling further, my heart shattered completely.  
  
Every time I got pregnant, they planned how to kill my child.  
  
Even the car accident from a year ago—Annabelle had been behind the wheel.  
  
She'd said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone. Cassian had eagerly agreed.  
  
His only instruction: ""Try not to kill her outright.""  
  
They discussed hurting me and murdering my children as casually as commenting on the weather.  
  
My nails dug into my palms until blood dripped between my fingers.  
  
The photo album contained thousands of pictures—all of Annabelle. Candid shots, selfies together, morning scenes, walks, intimate dinners where he'd prepared special meals for her pregnancy...  
  
There were 99+ videos. I switched to that section and felt ice water flood my veins.  
  
Countless recordings of their intimate moments, like they were documenting every encounter.  
  
Even role-playing scenarios that made my stomach turn.  
  
I pressed my hand to my mouth, fighting nausea.  
  
But worse were six videos labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way to ""Sixth.""  
  
Realizing what they contained, bile rose in my throat as blood filled my mouth.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I bit down hard on my lip and opened the sixth video.  
  
Cassian and Annabelle were laughing together.  
  
In front of them lay...my unboren puppy.  
  
The blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My wolf howled in agony, the pain causing my stomach to cramp violently.  
  
I couldn't hold back anymore, leaning over the bed rail as dry heaves wracked my body.  
  
I didn't sleep that night, my wolf pacing restlessly in my mind as tears soaked through my hospital gown.  
  
The next morning, Cassian brought me breakfast as usual—an elaborate spread he'd personally selected.  
  
Pancakes, fresh fruit, coffee, pastries...  
  
I'd once thought this was his way of showing love. Now I knew it was just thoughtless guilt, buying his way out of actually caring.  
  
Remembering the videos, I dry heaved again.  
  
Seeing my distress, Cassian's expression filled with concern:  
  
""Still feeling sick? Damn it, this is all my fault. I hate seeing my mate like this.""  
  
""I'm fine. I want to go home.""  
  
Something flickered across Cassian's face—a moment of tension.  
  
""You just lost another pup. My mother isn't... handling it well. If you go back to the pack house now, you'll just walk into a shitstorm. Maybe we should wait until things cool down.""  
  
I said nothing, but his expression told me everything I needed to know.  
  
That afternoon, while he was gone, I packed my things and wheeled myself to the pack house.  
  
I rolled through the front door to find Annabelle curled up in Cassian's lap, both of them cooing over a baby whose scent carried unmistakable traces of Graves bloodline.  
  
Margaret emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of bone broth, personally feeding Annabelle spoonful by spoonful.  
  
The three of them looked like the perfect family unit.  
  
The moment Margaret caught my scent, her eyes flashed with her wolf's displeasure.  
  
""Well, well. Look what crawled back to the den. You've got some nerve showing your face here after what you've done.""  
  
""My Alpha son treats you like a precious mate, and this is how you repay him? Another dead heir. You're cursed, and you're bringing that curse into our pack!""  
  
""Annabelle is the one deserves to be Luna of the Moonvale Pack. Get out of my territory—you're poison to this pack.""  
  
Annabelle followed Margaret's gaze to me, her eyes glittering with the triumph:  
  
""Luna Margaret, don't be so harsh. What if Evelyn gets upset and starts spreading lies about Alpha and me to the other packs?""  
  
""Let her try. No pack leader gives a damn what a barren she-wolf has to say.""  
  
I knew Margaret had always despised me. She thought I was too headstrong for an Alpha's mate, too independent—that I'd challenge her son's authority instead of submitting properly.  
  
Annabelle was everything she wanted: beautiful, submissive, making Cassian the center of her universe like a proper Luna should.  
  
She'd only wanted Annabelle as her son's mate, but then Annabelle married into another pack, and I'd given up everything to be the perfect Alpha's mate.  
  
Margaret had reluctantly accepted me into the pack.  
  
But years of failed pregnancies had pushed her resentment to the breaking point.  
  
Now that Annabelle was back—with Cassian's heir—Margaret felt free to unleash every bit of venom she'd been storing.  
  
If only she knew that every one of those lost pups had been orchestrated by her beloved Alpha.  
  
Every grandchild she'd mourned had been murdered by the woman she was now treating like precious pack treasure.  
  
In the past, Cassian would have used his Alpha command to intervene. Now he sat there holding Annabelle's child, acting like he couldn't hear a word.  
  
Annabelle nestled deeper into his arms:  
  
""Cassian, you're paying more attention to the pup than to me. Your wolf is making mine jealous.""  
  
Cassian's expression melted with adoration as he nuzzled her neck, scenting her:  
  
""You know you're my true mate. But look what I have for you.""  
  
I followed Annabelle's delighted gaze to a document on the coffee table: ""Pack Territory Transfer Agreement.""  
  
""Oh my God, Cassian! You're giving me pack lands?""  
  
She kissed the corner of his mouth, shooting me a triumphant look over his shoulder.  
  
I smiled back coldly, my wolf finally going still in my mind.  
  
Enjoy it while you can.  
  
Soon enough, you and your precious Alpha will be crawling back to me, begging.

1lyjysb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lyjysb/help_how_to_deal_with_disrespectful_relatives/,Help! how to deal with disrespectful relatives?,"Hey everyone, so we've been away for a couple of days off of city staying at my cousin's apartment. To start off my sister, my mom and I are not very found of my dad's side of family I can't disclose the reasons in here but they can be condensed to displays of covert disrespect disguised as playful jokes. I'm disappointed to admit that same thing can't be said about my dad, he assumes that they're not ill intended, his judgment is clouded by their wagtail behavior. My mom didn't come with us because she knew the disrespect is bound to happen again. Last time she had visited she was subjected to blatant disrespect and belittling from my dad infront of my cousin's family. It is a delicate matter since my dad has deepest affection to his niece and his family (his niece is the father of the family and he is actually my cousin and his kids are closer to us age wise) and we don't want to upset my dad that's the sole reason we tolerate this behavior. Since our visit these two things happened:

1- today we went to a mall my sister my cousin's wife and I, we ended up at Walmart as our last stop everything was going well until that point. So my cousin's wife let's call her Jane, picked up some groceries saying that we need some stuff for tomorrow's meal (since we'll go out tomorrow she's gonna prepare a meal for all of us) we went to checkout and pay. I should emphasize that we come from a culture where hospitality is highly regarded and putting the guests in any situation where they might feel like a burden is very disrespectful and make them pay for their stay is super distasteful and out of the norm. So we went to checkout and I'm about to pass Jane and my sister is waiting down the line while Jane is frantically looking for something inside her bag she's shouting that she doesn't have her phone and that the only way to pay is by her wallet application she's shouting at us if she has forgotten it somewhere and to call her cellphone. So we're just standing there dumbfounded thinking she'll at least have some emergency cash in her bag to pay for the groceries. So some moments go by which consisted of me looking at my sister and at the poor cashier lady who's just waiting for the completion of transaction. Me and my sister are shocked at this point and lastly my sister offers to pay but Jane refuses and says we will return the items. I need to make it clear that my sister and I didn't mind paying, earlier we got gifts for Jane's daughter which cost more than these groceries. But in the slim chances that she might've really forgotten her phone and she doesn't carry her physical wallet and that she neither possess an emergency cash, I let that slide. Shit happens and you find yourself in unpredictable embarassing situations and thinking that's the case I didn't take it to heart. 

2- we come home from mall and within 10 minutes of arrival she asks how much my sister weights now I taught nothing of it afterall who asks this question with malicious intent right? She makes my sister go on the scale just to make sure and after five times she insists that my sister is using the scale the wrong way. Now I don't know if she was trying to prove that my sister was weighing less or more of what she told her. But then after coming back to the room that I was currently in, she rants about how my sister had gained weight and kinda bringing her own weight in the conversation? My sister said Jane was comparing her weight to hers and make her feel bad about it. Now this was intentional and inexcusable behavior, if you let this level of disrespect slide you've disrespected yourself. Earlier when we were in McDonald's we took coffee for ourselves and I got a sweet too. Now my sister is a coffee addict and this was her second coffee of the day we sat at the table and for a while she didn't stop telling my sister to stop drinking so much coffee as if she's a doctor who's advice should be highly regarded. Mind you my sister has the common sense but she was going on and on with this concern of hers until I changed the subject. So I started eating my cookie and Jane and I are sitting next to each other with my sister on the opposite side when Jane turn to me with a maxim torso twist that her body could master and analysis my face then comments as if it's the most groundbreaking discovery of her life that I have acne and I should stop eating sweets. I laughed it off cuz I don't know how one can give a satisfactory answer to this question. 

3- she (the whole family possibly) is plain racist. When we were on our way to the bus stop after exiting the mall and we were waiting to cross the street when a black lady passes by with a stroller this is her comment ""black women show so much skin...they wanna show off......but there's nothing interesting to see..... but when white people dress this way it looks good on them"" mind you we're in Mississauga, Ont. Where the temperature was 32 degrees today at that exact time. The lady's outfit was too revealing for her taste but she wouldn't have criticize the outfit had the lady been a white women. Then she adds that when they were in Germany the government would take the black people and send them away to distant towns because they would ruin the beauty of the city? She said this in a tone that suggests this attitude towards black people should inspire other nations. Now I was utterly disgusted.

I need y'all's advice because quite frankly my sister and I have never associated with people the likes of Jane and we're not confrontational. Now that I think about it my mom did a good thing for not coming with us I'm disgusted by her behavior. Specially in the Walmart incident, I'm not upset about the fact that my sister paid, it's the sheer audacity of hers to think that we're stupid to believe her excuse that she did lost/forgot her phone. Mind you we spent like three hours walking around the mall and going to the bathroom and you're telling me it never occured to her to check her bag for her phone? Also funny enough when we arrived at their apartment she hadn't forgotten the key to the apartment. like what are the chances? This situation was so ridiculous that it was funny like there's no way this women did that and she's deadass serious about it. We were laughing about it but sad thing is we're not in charge of the situation. Had it been up to my sister and I we'd leave right after she forced my sister to set foot on the scale. But truely it's disgusting never in my life I've heard of people being like this as guests. She's intrusive and her comments makes us uncomfortable as I said I'm tolerating out of respect for my dad. Mind you when they visit us they couldn't ask for more. The food is always ready the best meals, we moved them around to Montreal when they come to visit us in Quebec. We went to Quebec city and ended staying overnight because my cousin seemed to love the city even though it wasn't financially convenient for us at the time but because they're so precious to my dad we ended up staying. My mom said Jane has a reputation for being stingy so I'm skeptical that the incident was a mere unfortunate coincidence. Please help guys right now I should be sleeping but I'm unable to. I'm writing this because I'm so uncomfortable with the whole thing and we're staying for another whole day which seems exhausting. ",1,1752380903.0,Advice,0,0.67,False

I doordashed some Pepto and the pain subsided a little bit but when I went to the bathroom an hour later my stool was black. The pain came back full force a few hours later and not even a hot bath was helping with any kind of relief so I ended up drinking more Pepto around 2am.

Display case/bookshelf behind the stairs on the left side of the bathroom door. Then I’m kind of stuck with the lounge & armchair. Lounge in front of the window?

⸻

Hello. My name is Diamond Ball.
Also known as “bitch,” “slut,” “whore,” and “cunt” — by the woman who gave me life.

If she was ever a good mother, it must have been before I started forming memories.
Because I can’t recall a single moment of selflessness.
No protection.
No peace.
Not once — not from her.

⸻

I remember when I was eleven.
It was a Saturday — one of the few mornings we were allowed to sleep in after five long days of school.
But I was woken up at 7 a.m. by my mother.

She wanted me to ride with her down the street so she could grab a coffee.
I was tired. I said I didn’t want to go.

She threw a coat in my face and snapped,
“I’m not going by myself.”

I told her again — softly, honestly — that I was tired.
She punched me in the face.

I fell backward onto her bed, stunned.
She walked away like nothing had happened.

From down the hall, she called,
“Get up and put the coat on.”

I did.
Tears staining my cheeks, I put on the coat and followed her to the car.

We drove in silence.

She went into the store and came back with two coffees —
one for her, and one for me.

That was her apology.
A coffee.
For her 11-year-old daughter.

That was the first time she hit me.
It wasn’t the last.

⸻

I’m the oldest of four.

I was born in 1998.
My brother Jimmy came a year later, in 1999.
Dustin followed in 2001, and Isaiah, the youngest, in 2006.

But before any of us, there was Destiny —
my mother’s first daughter.
She was born on March 18th, 1996 —
exactly two years before me.
She was born with a heart defect.
She passed away on March 27th, 1996.

She didn’t even make it to two weeks old.

And then, two years later to the day, I arrived.
Same birthday. Same gender. Same place in the family.

Sometimes I wonder what that meant to my mother.
She lost one daughter…
and was handed another.

A chance to love.
A chance to heal.
A rainbow baby.

But she didn’t treat me like a gift.
She barely treated me like I was hers at all.
Not even like a child.
Not even like a human being.

And that kind of rejection…
haunts me.

⸻

From Monday to Friday evening, we had a sober parent.

But once the sun went down on Friday,
whatever shred of “mother” she’d been holding onto during the week —
it disappeared.

It was like clockwork.
She became a loud, provocative, vulgar, sloppy mess.
And those “motherly instincts” she claimed to have?
They were only ever reserved for my brothers.

I was the oldest.
I was the daughter.
And I was invisible.

I can’t even count how many times I had to wake her up —
passed out on the toilet,
pants down, body limp, mouth half open.

That was my mother.

That was my Friday night.

⸻

Our weekends?
They were all about my brothers and their baseball.

Practice.
Games.
Trips to the field.
Every Saturday and Sunday was reserved for them.

I remember once — I told my mom I wanted to try cheerleading.
Just one thing for me.

She let me go to the tryouts. I was excited.
Hopeful.

Then she heard the price.

And just like that, it was over.
No explanation. No apology.
Just silence.

I never went back.
And I never heard another word about it.

Meanwhile, my brothers?
They got everything.

Uniforms.
Cleats.
Gloves.
Bats.
Whatever they needed, they had it — no questions asked.

I learned pretty quickly that wanting something was a setup for disappointment.
Especially if you were me.
Especially if you were the girl.

⸻

My father worked religiously —
long hours, always gone.
So it was usually just us with her.
Mostly just my brothers with her.

I was only ever relevant when she was drunk.

She didn’t want to drink alone.
And for some reason… I became her audience.

She’d let me stay up late —
until the early hours of the next day.
Not out of bonding.
Not out of love.
She just didn’t want to be alone.

And when I got too tired, she’d bribe me to stay awake.
Sometimes with food.
Sometimes with promises.
Other times… with threats.

She’d flick her lighter on and hold it near me —
laughing, saying it would “wake me up.”

And once… when I was sixteen,
she followed through.

She burnt my thigh.
With her lighter.
Because I was tired.
Because I didn’t want to sit with her and watch her destroy herself.

⸻

The first hit — physically — came when I was eleven.
But the first mental hit came then, too.

I went through premature puberty.
My body changed faster than I could understand it.
By third grade, I had C cups.

While other girls wore cute little training bras,
I was stuck in adult bras — stiff, tight, and impossible to hide.

I hated them.

Every woman knows the relief of coming home and finally taking off her bra.
That first deep breath. That little bit of peace.

I wasn’t allowed that.

I wasn’t allowed to take mine off —
not even at home.
Not around her.

But it wasn’t embarrassment.
She wasn’t ashamed of my body.

She was jealous.
And she was outraged.

The sight of me — a young girl trapped in a woman’s body —
infuriated her.

Instead of protecting me…
she punished me.

⸻

I slept in a full-on bra for years.

Because if I dared to take it off — even for a second of relief — the comments would start.

“That’s disgusting.”
“They’re too big.”
“They swing around like apes on trees.”
“Why are they shaped like that?”
“They look like torpedoes.”

But then came the worst one — the one that changed everything.

“You’re not gonna walk around like that in front of my husband.”

My biological father.

Like I was some threat.
Like I had chosen to look this way.
Like I should be ashamed for existing in my own body.

“If anyone is gonna walk around like that, it’s me.”
“You look like a slut.”

She hated me for developing.
She hated me for growing into a body that she couldn’t control.
And so she did the one thing a mother should never do —

She made me hate it too.

⸻

Then it moved on to shorts.

I couldn’t wear them.
Not in public.
Not even around the house.

If I ever tried,
I’d feel the sting of a smack —
sharp, sudden, intentional.
Or I’d hear the words that cut deeper than any slap.

The message was always the same:
You don’t deserve to be comfortable.
You don’t deserve to be seen.

That was the consequence
for showing too much skin
in the house I was raised in.

⸻

My mother’s weight fluctuated severely while I was growing up.
She’d gain, then lose, then gain again.
And the heavier she got, the worse her treatment of me became.

It was like every pound she carried turned into more resentment,
more jealousy,
more rage —
and she projected it all onto me.

I became the target.
Not because I did anything wrong,
but because I represented everything she hated about herself.

My changing body, my youth, my femininity —
they didn’t make her proud.
They made her furious.

And I paid for it.
With my comfort.
With my safety.
With my self-worth.

⸻

There’s more.

So much more than what I’ve written here.
More memories.
More pain.
More truth.

But for now, this is where I pause.

This is just the beginning of Mommy Issues —
a space where I will speak,
unravel,
and heal on my terms.

When I’m ready, I’ll share more.
Until then, thank you for reading the parts of me I wasn’t supposed to say out loud.

Let me know if you want pt.2

People share the most insightful thoughts when they're just... talking.

But then they sit down to write a LinkedIn post and suddenly it's like pulling teeth.

**The problem?** We treat content creation like formal writing when it should feel more like conversation.

Think about it:

* You explain complex concepts perfectly to colleagues
* You have strong opinions during team meetings
* You share valuable insights in casual conversations

But somehow when it's ""content creation time,"" we freeze up.

**The voice-to-text shift is happening.** More professionals are using voice notes not just for messaging, but as their primary way to capture and develop ideas. It's faster, more natural, and honestly captures personality better than typing.

Working for Will (AI LinkedIn ghostwriter for busy professionals via WhatsApp) has shown me how powerful this approach is. People who struggle with writing suddenly become articulate when they just talk through their thoughts. No pressure, no editing paralysis - just capturing ideas as they happen.

*Even with writing longer-form articles, when you’re too close to the task, you miss things.* 

**Question for you:** How do you capture your best ideas? Are you a voice note person, or do you stick to typing everything out?",1,1752380318.0,linkedin,0,0.67,False
