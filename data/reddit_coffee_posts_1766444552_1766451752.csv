1ptgejv,https://i.redd.it/s1vdl4ojru8g1.jpeg,I Chose The GPA Over The Genius,"Chapter 1
I’ve known one thing since I was old enough to know anything at all: I was the Heroine, and Rhys Maxwell, my brilliant, perpetually-scowling boy-next-door, was the Hero.

The captions floating in my periphery—the ones only I could see, a constant, shimmering overlay I called The Script—always told the same story: ‘The clueless ingénue and the genius scholar.’ ‘They are literally endgame. Total OTP material.’

Egged on by a thousand digital whispers of ‘Ship them!’ and ‘Such a vibe!’ I’d been Rhys’s shadow, his devoted little barnacle, for years.

Until today, when I found a box of emergency contraception tucked deep inside his backpack.

The Script would tell me, as it always did, that this was just a massive misunderstanding.

But I was tired of being the girl who always understood. I decided, right then, that I was done loving Rhys Maxwell.

1

The box of birth control was lying there, stark white and unforgiving, when I pulled open Rhys’s travel bag.

I replayed his words in my head—the ones he’d delivered after our last fumbling kiss, his breath minty and cool: ""Wren, we’re still young. Some things should wait until we’ve thought them through.""

So, if we were still waiting, who was he planning to not wait with?

The Script went ballistic. The text became huge, blinding: 'Here we go! Time for the angst arc!' 'Don't be mad, sweetie! It's totally a misunderstanding! Rhys only has eyes for you!'

I held the small box, my expression a confusing blank slate of shock and exhaustion. I considered shoving it back in, pretending I’d never seen it, but then Rhys, fresh out of the shower and smelling of pine and academic stress, emerged from his bedroom.

“It’s for Sylvie, the Senior Research Fellow,” he sighed, running a tired hand over his wet hair. “The pressure on the computational chemistry project is killing her. She’s been having debilitating cycles and can barely function in the lab. I spoke to the university clinic—this might help regulate things. I was going to drop it off tomorrow.”

He took the box from my hand, his touch surprisingly gentle, and slid it into a hidden zipper pouch in his pack.

“There’s nothing going on between us, Wren,” he insisted. “Just professional courtesy between lab partners. I know how much you overthink things.”

His voice was heavy with a profound fatigue that felt less about the lab work and more about fighting with me. We’d had too many arguments about Sylvie; too many explosive scenes fueled by my insecurity.

“It’s true, little sis! I swear, Rhys hasn't done anything with Sylvie!” The Script screamed in my vision. 'Don't let this misunderstanding ruin things! Fighting is so destructive!'

I nodded, the movement almost imperceptible. I looked him in the eye, and for the first time in my life, I lied to Rhys Maxwell.

“I believe you.”

The dramatic shift in my demeanor—the lack of tears or yelling—actually made him pause, his disbelief visible.

I sealed the zipper, closing off the pills, the argument, and the Script’s frenzied pleas. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to snoop. Your mom—Aunt Eliza—just asked me to check if you packed your chargers for the research seminar trip.”

I turned to grab the clothes he needed, anything to break eye contact and put distance between us.

“No—wait—I didn’t say you were snooping. You can…”

He didn’t finish the sentence, and I kept my back to him, deliberately missing the bewildered, slightly wounded look on his face.

2

Rhys messaged me right after my afternoon lecture, asking where I was.

I'm meeting my roommates at the dining hall. What's up?

I hit send and then saw his silhouette across the courtyard, waving. He was waiting for me. Rhys rarely waited for me. He was always booked: classes, the lab, research meetings, leaving me with slivers of his time.

He reached me and took my hand.

“My team meeting ended early,” he said, pulling me in the direction of the main gate. “How about that sketchy Thai place you love? The one with the crazy spicy Pad See Ew?”

I pulled my hand free.

Rhys stopped, a flash of genuine hurt crossing his features before he gripped my hand tighter. His palm was warm, even as the early autumn wind whipped around us.

“Don’t be mad, okay?” he pleaded. “There’s nothing with Sylvie. I was wrong. I’ll be more careful, I promise. I’ll keep a professional distance from now on.”

I looked into his eyes. They were sincere. I truly believed he meant it right now.

But sincerity is fleeting.

Every time we fought, he gave me this exact apology, this exact promise. And every time, we ended up fighting about Sylvie again.

I scanned the quad, searching. When I spotted my roommate, Jamie, I gave her a small, tight wave to show I was on my way.

“You always say that place smells like feet,” I reminded him, the lie smooth and easy. “And anyway, I made plans with my roommates. That place closed down last month.”

I slipped my hand out of his and walked toward Jamie.

The truth was, I’d gone to that Thai place alone weeks ago. The owner had been so heavy-handed with the chili oil that the “mild” dish had made me cry. I had sat in the corner for hours, eating and sobbing until the heat and the sadness were both completely purged.

3

The next morning, my phone buzzed with texts from Rhys.

Finals are coming. I highlighted all the key concepts for your Intro to Bio and your Lit Theory classes.

I also compiled a predictive question set.

Please study hard. You can’t afford to fail this semester.

I’ve always been slow.

In elementary school, a teacher worried I might have a learning disability and suggested my parents get me tested. My IQ score was 71. Seventy is the clinical definition of a developmental disorder.

My parents moved from panic to acceptance. “It’s fine, Wren,” my mother always said. “A little slow, a little simple. Simple people have simple luck.”

I guess I did have simple luck.

Rhys’s parents moved in next door shortly after. Their son, Rhys, was the genetic lottery winner. Handsome, smart—cooler than any Ken doll. I was instantly obsessed.

When I was still wiping snot on my sleeve, I was trailing after him, a tiny, annoying satellite. Rhys was so standoffish and easily annoyed that the kid-me wanted to retreat a million times.

But The Script always appeared: 'Don't be shy, baby girl! Be persistent!' 'Rhys is just a repressed hottie! He pretends to hate it, but your innocence melts his cold heart!'

Cheered on by the digital chorus, I became his permanent fixture.

I knew he liked me, too.

Rhys was a high-functioning genius who excelled at everything without effort. There was only one thing he threw himself into: tutoring me.

I, the girl barely above the line of being considered intellectually disabled, was tutored by him all the way to the same top-tier university. The day I got my acceptance letter, Rhys actually smiled.

“Congrats,” he said, his eyes bright. “Four more years of having to keep up with me.”

We made it official shortly after. The Script showered us with blessings. Everything looked like the perfect, inevitable trajectory.

But something shifted in college. The time we spent together dwindled. We weren’t the sweet, messy couple from the romance comics I read. He was always busy: lectures, labs, research seminars, grad student study groups…

I accepted it. His texts, even the brief ones, were enough to sustain me for days.

Until the day I saw him eating with Sylvie in the dining hall.

I stared at the phone in my hand, at the text Rhys had just sent me: 'Can't talk. Busy.' My eyes welled up immediately.

I read The Script’s hasty explanation: ‘They’re just lab partners getting a quick bite after their experiment. It means nothing.’

It was nothing. His smile was wide and genuine—that was nothing. They were in the same cutting-edge research team, intellectually matched. It was expected they’d have things to talk about.

I’d subtly suggested Rhys create some distance with Sylvie, but he always dismissed me with his classic: “She’s just a colleague, Wren. You’re being too dramatic.”

Then the campus gossip board blew up. A post speculating that Rhys, the untouchable scholar, had been claimed by Sylvie, the glamorous research star, went viral.

My roommates looked at me with pity. I pretended not to care.

“They’re in the same lab,” I shrugged. “They have to interact. It’s unavoidable.”

But the excuses were starting to taste like dust. I couldn’t swallow them anymore.

4

It was Rhys’s birthday. I baked him a cake from scratch and waited outside his apartment building.

I imagined the look on his face when he got home. Would he give me his usual tired, exasperated chuckle, or would he actually be surprised and tell me my baking had improved?

I waited from dusk until late into the night. Sitting, then crouching, then finally curled up on the cold steps. Rhys never answered his phone.

Just as I was about to panic and call the campus police, my roommate sent me a screenshot.

It was from Sylvie’s private Instagram story.

""Celebrating my junior research fellow. Happy Birthday to the best lab partner!""

Attached was a photo of her and Rhys. They looked incredible together.

Rhys was smeared with frosting, but he was laughing—a genuine, unrestrained laugh.

I remembered my own eighteenth birthday. I’d dabbed a tiny smudge of icing on his nose, and he’d lost his temper, telling me he had a phobia of messes and hated things like that.

But the Rhys in the photo didn't look displeased. He was gazing at Sylvie with an expression I instantly recognized: fondness.

The Script started its defense again: ‘It wasn’t a private dinner! The whole lab was celebrating!’ ‘Sylvie only posted a photo of the two of them to stir up trouble! Don’t fall for it!’

This time, the digital excuses couldn’t stop the long-suppressed bitterness from finally rising.

I sat on his doorstep and cried until my eyes were dry.

Rhys finally came home long after midnight.

“Where were you?” My voice was raw and hoarse.

He took one look at the melted, misshapen cake box in my hands, wrinkled his nose in distaste, and pulled out his keys.

“Team bonding dinner.”

I felt something sharp and excruciating twist in my chest. I shoved the photo in front of his face.

“I’ve never seen you smile like that at a ‘team bonding dinner.’”

His hand froze on the doorknob. He turned back, his brow furrowed.

“What is your problem, Wren? Are you being sarcastic?”

The cake fell from my numb hands and splattered on the concrete. My eyes burned red.

“You hate people putting icing on you! You said you had a phobia of messes!” I yelled. “Is it that you don’t like icing on you, or is it that you don’t like me?”

I grabbed his shirt, shaking it violently. “If you didn’t like me, why did you let me chase you for all these years? Why did you agree to date me?”

I was tearing at his collar, and a button popped off, clattering onto the ground.

It wasn't a standard button. It was the one I’d personally sewn onto his shirt the day we started dating.

""Rhys,"" I'd whispered, ""the second button on a man's shirt is closest to his heart. I hope you only keep me in yours.""

Rhys looked at me with utter contempt, as if I were a screeching, unreasonable child.

“It’s my birthday,” he said, peeling my hands off his shirt. “I didn’t ask you to come here. How I spend my time is my business.”

He stepped over the ruined cake, his voice cold. “I told you a hundred times, she’s just a colleague. And you choose to pick a fight about it on my birthday. Can you please, for once, just grow up?”

5

I told Rhys we were done.

I blocked his number, his social media, and every way he could contact me. I went back to my dorm and, in a fit of despair, started tossing every piece of evidence of our relationship into the trash.

The love letters I’d written him, the candid photos I’d taken of him, the journals where I’d documented my secret crush.

The Script, of course, was heartbroken: 'She’s really hurting now. Just letting out the frustration.' 'I wish they would just talk! It's all a misunderstanding. Rhys and Sylvie have nothing going on!'

‘They’ll get back together, obviously, but this fighting is damaging.’ ‘Rhys is just emotionally stunted, a genius with a blind spot for feelings. Only his sunshine girl can handle him.’

‘If she’d just calm down and think back, she’d realize Rhys loves her.’

Calm down and think back?

I salvaged the items from the bin and looked at them. They felt… different.

I pulled out the stack of love letters. Rhys had returned them immediately when I gave them to him, unread. Now, flipping through them, I saw tiny corrections in red pen marking my spelling errors and misplaced commas.

My heart hitched. When had he looked at these?

The Script immediately started swooning: 'Rhys, the repressed academic, correcting her love letters! Dying!' 'I remember that! He stole them back just to read them and correct her grammar. He was planning for her to find them and realize he’d seen them all along!'

‘Look at the candid photo too! He told her he was asleep from studying, but he was actually exhausted from making her study guides!’

I picked up the photo of Rhys asleep on his desk.

‘Rhys is a genius, he doesn’t have to study that hard. He spent days building a curriculum for her so they could get into the same college. That’s what made him pass out!’

‘He worked all night on her coursework and tutored her all day. He’s the silent guardian. That’s just his personality, let him be.’

I flipped through my old diaries, the pages marking the time before the college entrance exams.

My parents had practically given up. They had hired expensive tutors, but the ROI was dismal. They were ready to settle for the nearest state college when Rhys stepped in. He offered to tutor me, saying he had the time and figured he could at least try to pull off a miracle.

Under his guidance, my practice scores climbed steadily. I genuinely believed I was finally “smart” and that his casual tutoring was enough.

I had been blind. It had been Rhys. All of it.

A rush of warmth washed over the icy pain. When everyone else had lowered their expectations for me, it was Rhys who had lifted me up, dragging me to this incredible university.

6

I gathered the scattered pieces of my life off the dorm room floor and put them back in the cabinet.

I tossed and turned all night, watching the pre-dawn light bleed through the window. Finally, I unblocked Rhys’s number.

I’m sorry, Rhys. I was too insecure and overreacted.

I still want to be with you. Please don’t let us break up.

He didn't reply.

He’d been complaining about the lab being overwhelming. I decided to get up, grab coffee and bagels, and wait for him outside the research building.

The door required a key card, so I stood in the biting, mid-winter wind, clutching the warm bag of food. My fingers were starting to go numb as I called him. No answer.

I looked through the glass, desperation mounting, and spotted a student who looked like he was taking a break. I knocked on the glass, hoping for help.

The student cracked the door open and told me outside students couldn’t come in, but he’d page my contact.

“I’m Rhys Maxwell’s girlfriend,” I said, trying to look composed. “Can you check if he’s in the lab? I have his breakfast.”

The student looked confused, then told me he’d ask. He pulled out his phone. The automatic glass door closed, but the seal was bad. I could still clearly hear his phone conversation.

“Yeah, that Rhys Maxwell, can you check?”

“Oh, he’s not in? Okay, I’ll tell her.”

I was about to thank him when I heard him lower his voice, whispering conspiratorially to the person on the other end.

“Can you believe it? This girl says she’s Rhys’s girlfriend!”

“I know, right? It’s wild. Rhys and Sylvie are practically glued together. Everyone thought they were the couple.”

My legs felt like jelly. I gripped the cold wall to steady myself. The Script was a deafening, panicked blur, but I couldn't focus on the words.

Glued together.

The couple.

A shared meal meant nothing. A shared workspace meant nothing. A birthday celebration meant nothing.

Did kissing mean nothing? Was that another misunderstanding?

I fought for breath. I knew the student could hear the frantic rhythm of my breathing.

I managed to adjust my expression into a tight, strained smile and called out to him before he could put his phone away.

“Hey, could you do me one last favor? I need you to pass another message to Rhys.”

He looked uncomfortable, realizing the poor acoustics of the door. “W-what is it?”

I kept the painful smile fixed on my face.

“Just tell him… the message I sent him on his phone this morning? It doesn’t count anymore.”",1,1766451605.0,NovelsSearch,0,1.0,False

Now his channel still exists, with the old banner promising weekly uploads and everything, but it has no public videos.

To be clear, he DID announce his retirement from making videos, there's a goodbye post here on reddit which I'll link below, but the strange thing is that retirement is all he announced. There was no mention of the back catalogue being deleted, in fact he simply refers to the channel ""going quiet"" in his post, with no mention of his plans to delete/private the old videos or why.

  
Whether the videos are gone entirely or simply privated, I have no idea, but it would be a crying shame to lose them forever. His videos were not only entertaining, but taught me much of what I know about Morrowind, and were my go-to resource for friends just getting into the game.

  
Here's a link to the YT channel, and the reddit post announcing his departure about 8 months ago.

Alright everyone, looking for some Rocket Appartamento troubleshooting help. I’ve always had issues with the high limit switches tripping. No problem, open it up, tap them down a bit and everything worked fine for weeks, even months. This is one recurring issue I’ve always had. 

After they tripped it seemed like every day for a couple of days, I gave up a bit and let my machine sit there.   I know, not good. So I decided to finally fix it. I called some of the online retailers and eventually ended up reducing pressure on the pressure stat a quarter turn, and my boiler pressure hovered around 1-1.1 bar. I also adjusted the OPV from about 13 bar to 9 bar, measuring with a pressure gauge installed at the group head. 

Everything worked fine for almost a month, recommitting to making better espresso, picking up some new accessories along the way. Then one day, I was in other room, and heard hissing noises and there was steam coming out from what seemed like all around the machine, with boiler pressure gauge reading 2.5 and climbing. I turned it off. Tried it a couple of times after that and same thing happened. 

I called Chris Coffee and they suggested I replace the peessurestat (I have the Mater one). So I just installed, fired it up, and same thing is happening.  So any ideas? Thanks. ",1,1766451214.0,rocketespresso,0,1.0,False

I am in small, but somewhat major city. After two days I got a warning saying my cancelation rate was getting too high, except I haven't been cancelling trips, only denying them. Right now it says it's 10% and shouldn't go below 15%. Does denying requests count as cancelling?

Also, the major reasons for denying trips is that I am already in a very dense delivery area with many people and many restaurants. It seems every third request is sending me wayyyy far from the ""hot"" zone, and also the place it wants to send me is a very dangerous are of my city that I would like to avoid entirely. 

The other reason is that Uber always starts spamming me requests right as I'm about to arrive at my destination, just as I am trying to figure out where to go. The timing of it is very annoying and quite frankly dangerous sometimes, as I am in traffic and have to fumble with my phone with cars all around. A lot of times I'll deny a request and it will just send me the exact same request that I just denied as well. 

Anyway, what are y'all's strategies to keep a low cancellation rate and not be spammed deliveries that don't make sense to your location? Should I just hit the coffee cup icon after accepting a delivery and then turn it off after completing it? I'm not trying to only take the best deliveries.

With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

My days were cut down to 2 after going to college. I had to leave an hour early on 2 days for class and I got management approval. My two coworkers didnt mind and said they knew how important college is and even made sure I was leaving on time. I let them to take the cash tips and didn't touch that. However the manager put equal credit card tips and they were so pissed and complained. I told management they could have a higher percentage. Instead of doing that, he cut my days. 

Meanwhile, one of my coworkers would take coffee orders, be given cash and wouldnt even ring up the order and pocket the cash. I've noticed multiple times and told management and they didnt care, seemed lazy to investigate. 
And last week, something similar happened. The first day there was a $10 on the tip jar and disappeared. My coworker said he put it there so guests can put tips and I believed him. The second day, there was like $30 on the tip jar and I kept watching because I never saw him putting anything in. Towards the end of the shift, the money disappeared.  I told him I saw there was money there and he said he never noticed anything, he put a $5 himself but that was it. After half an hour or so, he said he found $30 on the floor and split it. Like seriously?

I can't click on anything, I can't trust anyone, the paranoia has completely settled in. 

This morn I was audienced with the precursors to my abled physician. While they were quite comley and verbally pleasant, with my queries, I knew i had to be expedient. I slowly opened the door to overhear any symphonious tones that may be lurkng overhead. Whilst I did hear melodies of the season, it was most fortuitous they were of times long past. I inquired with regard to the music, and It was explained ""this was the style agreed upon today."" 

Apparently, each morning there is a negotiation as to which variety of Yule chords shall be triumphant each day. I was thoroughly pleased with such delightful tidings. As I explained my predicament, they undoubtedly understood the seriousness of my concern. 

The previous day a much more sinister selection of Holiday tones were  lofting from above. Unfortunately, two warriors succumbed to the dreaded malfeasance of the ""Pop Christmas"" Playlist. One of them being an underling medical practitioner herself. They all knew there was nothing they could do to save her. 

In true regard for our warriors, they had decided to change stations every fresh day, in hopes of giving us a chance. I respect them greatly. 

I then recovered my eye enhancement equipment from a different location. They did have the perfect Whamhalla station on overhead. However, them knowing I am a warrior, waved me on before I opened the foyer door. They truly were angels of mercy. Another warrior, already inside, was sent to Whamhalla. I waited until I was given the all is safe signal, and I walked through the door. 

I witnessed the fallen warrior. He shook my my hand and asked to be honored this eve with a pint poured for him at my table. (I offered him coin for a coffee, but alas he was unable to accept).

That warrior, as he fell, reminded the good ladies I too am a warrior. He truly took one for the team. He could have let me perish, but the golden light he displayed was his goodness saving me. Thank you again, Warrior Alex. You are witnessed.

long story short ive been a partner for a while and a ssv for half of that. ive started to apply for the asm role and the first time i didn’t pass the recruiter but the second time I’m now about to talk to the RD for a coffee connect. 

me and my manager have a love hate relationship and it can be very confusing at times. I’ve dealt with mental health issues so many times at this store to where i’ve tried to transfer a couple times and demote and my store manager intercepted each time and i haven’t been allowed to leave. i’ve had other store managers show interest in me coming to their store and my store manager has nipped it in the bud and has refused to let me leave. she is very hard on me, and i take constructive criticism well but sometimes her delivery is demeaning and it sticks with you. anytime i’ve been close to transferring, it has always been “i can’t send a partner who doesn’t have a good reputation to another store, it looks bad on me” or when i was close to demoting it has been “you have been doing so well, lets just see how you feel in the coming weeks” and so i have stayed an ssv. recently one of our other ssvs have promoted and the other ssvs are in learning stages so they aren’t preforming on par right now. the only way i feel able to leave this environment is to get promoted, because the job market is trash right now and i have bills to pay. 

today i had a really bad shift, as everyone does and what had happened today has never happened to me before, the close was bad and i didn’t have the coverage i usually do since its the week of christmas. A lot was not done when she came in for the mid and there was a lot of back and forth between us on the floor. a lot of passive aggressive and for lack of a better word non-constructive criticism was given and i left really disappointed in myself and sad that my shift didn’t go the way that i wanted it to. i was still in a good mood knowing that I had a connect later that day and went home to start prepping for it. when i joined the meeting i waited 3 minutes before my RD called me to reschedule not giving an explanation as to why. and i know it might not be the case but could this be another instance of my store manager preventing me from leaving the store? 

if i made it that far in the interview process and everyone has liked me so far, could a store manager stop the process because they don’t want me to leave? or hypothetically make up a bs excuse as to why i wouldn’t be fit for the role?

1ptfva1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Gloomuar/comments/1ptfva1/robbery/,Robbery,"Johannesburg. South Africa. Present day.

The van was driving through the stuffy night toward the city’s outskirts. Thabo was behind the wheel — silent and grim. Sibusiso was crying, clutching a machete in his hands. The corpse of Sifo, his brother, lay on the back seat.

“Was it worth it?” Sibusiso asked Thabo. “We barely took anything — just some junk. No gold, no money. And where would you even find them in such a huge house…”

“Right. After you killed the owner,” Thabo said. “Shoved the machete into his gut all the way to the hilt.”

“He killed Sifo, goddamn it! My brother!!! That fucking old white man shot him point-blank in the head with a rifle — as soon as we walked into the house,” Sibusiso shouted, spitting saliva. “It was like he was waiting for us! Blew his damn head off!!!”

Sibusiso started to break down.

“So what do we do now?”

“Calm down,” Thabo said. “There’s no evidence. We took the body, and on the video you can’t tell who’s who anyway — we were masked.”

He almost joked about Sifo — that no one would recognize him for sure — but held back.

Sibusiso went silent and began to calm down. “We’ll bury your brother when we get there. And tomorrow we’ll sell the loot to the fence,” Thabo said quietly, lost in his own thoughts.

What Sibusiso didn’t know was that Thabo had changed the plan — they had gotten too little from the heist, and the panicky Sibusiso no longer fit into it.

Staring at the road through the dusty windshield, Thabo was mentally reviewing the layout of the house they had ransacked in a hurry. But something slipped away from him, hid — something cold and alien, beyond understanding.

“Did you notice anything weird? In that house?” Thabo asked.

“The weird thing was how he met us on the carpet like we were celebrities! You were the last one to enter, Thabo!” Sibusiso hissed.

“But that’s not it,” Thabo said quietly.

“Then what is it? Explain to me.” Sibusiso shifted his grip on the machete.

“Mirrors. In such a big, expensive house — and not a single mirror… And your machete — there was no blood on it when you pulled it out of the old man’s stomach. No blood. You get it?”

Sibusiso froze. Then, horrified, he tossed the machete aside and covered his face with his hands.

A silence fell — so heavy and grim it was like something black and sticky had filled the air, touching the back of their necks and stealing their ability to think.

Fear seemed to materialize, swelling behind their backs.

And in that moment, Sifo’s corpse suddenly sat up on the seat.

Thabo and Sibusiso lost all sense and control at the horror they saw — the van swerved off the road and slammed into a pole.

No one survived. Except for Sifo.

At dawn, Sifo brought the bodies to the owner of the house they had raided the night before. The necromancer was waiting in the backyard, sipping coffee.

“Finally, you showed up,” he said. “Good boy. I’d give you a bone to chew, but you’ve got no head.”

When I drink coffee, I get a brief energy boost but my thoughts wander, I feel less present, and a bit all over the place. I can see why someone might think I have ADHD in that state.

But when I cut out caffeine completely for a long time, I feel calmer, more grounded, more focused, and engaged, relationships are better, etc. The scattered feeling goes away.

I know ADHD is real and varies a lot person to person. I also work with people who are diagnosed and can notice some clear differences. It made me wonder if caffeine sensitivity can sometimes look like ADHD from the outside.

I’ve definitely had some inkling of Arthritis in the last two years, but didn’t put 2 and 2 together until today. I have hernedons nodes on my pointer fingers, and a node on the side of my wrist that comes and goes and my wrist is sore every now and then. The Last month or so my ankles have felt like they are going to give out sometimes - sort of like they’re not connected to my feet, mid step. But nothing really painful or concerning. 

Fast forward to last week, I moved to Florida. For the last week I’ve been swollen all over my body and my fingers are sausages. I had a cup of coffee at an outdoor market on Sunday and immediately I was in pain all over my body. Every single joint aches including my lower back. Last night while sleeping I kept waking up from the soreness. Today it’s worse, the aching is everywhere and I can hardly use my hands. My eyes are dry and I have a headache. I mean wow - I’m amazed that this can this happen so suddenly. Honestly it felt like I was poisoned by the coffee! I have hashimotos as well, so autoimmune stuff is just my cup of joe. I eat gluten free, am healthy otherwise. Honestly I guess I’m not surprised but a full blown flare without history of aches feels really wrong!!!!! ",1,1766449812.0,rheumatoid,2,0.67,False

hang around the sun decks, read and relax
hang around coffee shops, read and relax
gym workouts (I understand there is a sauna in the mens room - is that still true?)
Running - is there an outdoor track?  Any etiquette for it?

1ptfn70,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptfn70,Pet Food Bank Restock at Daack Pack,"Hey folks! Thanks to some generous community donations we’ll be doing a large and immediate restock. The team is doing supply runs now so tomorrow we will at least have plenty of dog food, cat food, and cat litter. Daack Pack will also have holiday presents for folks’ pets. 

Our pet food bank is in partnership with Sacramento SPCA as a satilitte location to help get needed supplies more distributed to our neighbors. It is free and there is no proof or barriers to recieve support. People and animals deserve their basic welfare met, minimally. While we recognize the systemic barriers and hardships many people are facing right now, we believe that as a community we can support each other and our pets through this. 

Stop by tomorrow to stock up!

12/23 - 11am to 8pm

\- Pet Food Pantry will be open as long as there are supplies available

\- Accepting donations via cash, venmo, zelle, or sealed pet supplies still in the origional packaging

\- We’ll have coffee, tea, and other beverages

\- Community pet gifts for folks who stop by (while supplies last)

\- 1030am to 1pm our Applied Animal Behaviorist will be running a mentoring session for some of our team on understanding the function of behaviors, the community is welcome to come and go if you’d like to have a space to learn

\- Free Native Plant seeds to support the migratory monarchs

\- Arts and crafts station

Due to the absolute need communicated by the community from yesterday’s restock, we ran out of almost 300lbs of dog food alone in under two hours of posting, we wanted to try to get more support out there for the holidays. Thank you for those who donated to help us make that possible. 

If you want to just come out and hangout with us, you are welcome to!

Important notes:

Pet Food Bank is completely free. We have been funding it ourselves, in partnership with SSPCA, or through community donations and support. 

Native Plant seed distribution is in partnership with the Live Monarch Foundation and will be an ongoing thing we will have to help distribute seeds into the community.

If you need pet food but getting to us isn’t possible, let us know and we will do what we can to help.

Again, we just don’t believe things have to be as hard as they can be if we all support each other. Come say “hi” to the team tomorrow, grab some coffee, pet food, hangout for a bit if you’d like.

So google has been working on this open source protocol for Agent-Driven Interfaces called [A2UI](https://a2ui.org) to solve this problem and allow AI agent to create uniform UI for different use cases (like data charts, ordering food, showing result...

In short, in my opinion, it is to bring back the useful part of the traditional UI to the chat interface - just like a renaissance :)

But definitely the good part is that with the protocol, agent-generated result can look more uniformed and there will be more reusable components and automated and workflows for developers.

As Google said in its official [announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/introducing-a2ui-an-open-project-for-agent-driven-interfaces/) last week: 

>A2UI was designed to address the specific challenges of interoperable, cross-platform, generative or template-based UI responses from agents. A2UI allows agents to generate the interface which best suits the current conversation with the agent, and send it to a front end application.

Continued and Concluded:

I put my head down and had that long series of intense dreams followed by jarring injections of wakefulness until about 520 when I gave up and made an extra large pot of extra strong coffee and decided to start my day early. I sighed when I got no reply from Sydney and my news alerts box began to overflow with news of some of kind of Middle East rocket attack. I drank deeply of my coffee and rubbed my eyes resigned that this was going to be one of those days.

After putting in an effort to move the ball on the rocket attack data, I emailed my boss and said I still had heating issues at home and I needed another half work from day. My phone buzzed but I was taken back by a sudden blast of heat wafting into the kitchen. It felt like someone had suddenly opened an oven but I wasn't running the oven or any other appliance other than the coffee maker. It was an uncomfortable swelling heat that took on a worse life as fishy ammonia smell polluted the morning. I was forced to take down the seals on one of the windows let some fresh air. As before the strange heat and the smells did not last long but I didn't know where they were coming from.

As I was running track around the apartment sniffing for the origin of the smell, pressing my hand on every appliance, every surface high and low for the source of the heat I hear a loud rush of air, followed by a loud groan and then what sounded like the bedroom door slam against the wall. This actually caused me to jump. I pinched myself to double check I'm not asleep before my laptop at the kitchen table as I round the corner of the hall to the bedroom. Everything looked awry but that's the way I left it. I couldn't even tell if that loud sound was the door or not.

At this point I'm still half way in my work and then half way chasing ghosts when I jump again at the sound of my phone buzzing on the kitchen table. I swing around to the laptop when the air turned cold and I shut the window. Then I heard low stomach growling and rumbling noise from down the hallway again.

“Okay.” I can't say I'm a big fan of Reddit, it is a fairly unreliable source for my job and I treat it that way for everything else but I felt like it was time to trouble shoot the bed and since their hot line was still inactive and their website offered very little else relevant to my issues, it was time to see what else was out there. I had a feeling that forums on the bed itself would be well manicured but the U-Sea company or one of their affiliates might be raw so I started there.

There wasn't much, only a few posts about how the range of their products are nautical and some of them are intended to be food and preserved by cold while others are not food and are preserved with a variety of chemicals and there could be some cross contamination.

I had the Rest EZ tab open and for the first time in this trial period I opened the recall item page and floated the cursor over it. I ran the numbers in my head. I've lived here less than two months, plenty of things were going on and the correlation between the strange goings on and the bed were not proven, not even close. What was important was how much better the bed made me feel, save for last night. I shook my head, there was higher chance of finding a ouija board Sydney had been using to try to contact her dad than something this bed was doing and so I closed the tab. “Not even close.” I muttered to myself in the kitchen.

My phone rang a third time and this time I actually looked at the number. I didn't recognize it so I hit end. I rubbed my eyes again and saw then looked through my phone history and saw it was the same number 3 times. I started typing in the number when my phone rang again and this time it was number I knew, it was Gigi, Sydney's friend who worked with her at the bakery.

“Sam!” Gigi yelled, “Sydney had a reaction...I think we got a contaminated shipment...maybe peanut exposed...she didn't have her pen on her this morning.”

“Oh my...Oh...” I stammered, “Did they get there on time...where did they..?”

“The ambulance got there fast but they took her and I gave them your contact info. I don't know which hospital they were taking her to.”

I lifted the phone from ear and searched the number that called me three times, “They took her St. Luke's.” I stated with a sinking shame and surging terror, “I'm going go there right now and I'll let you know how she's doing.”

This was my worst fear. The thing I thought I was mentally ready to handle not because of muscle memory or training really but because I holding steady searching a tank for a series number in the same frame with burning bodies was the same thing. I could not fathom that last thing we did together was fight and the last thing I sent her was ugly sarcastic wake up call. I drove there with presence. It was a lot of hurry up and wait.

I sat in a glass and metal waiting room. The entire facility reminded me of my sterile university office and it gave me comfort. Still I was waiting, outwardly patiently but inwardly I thought about anaphylaxis – an immune response creating multi-organ multi-system shock resulting in rashes, rapid pulse, vomiting, low blood pressure, swelling of the tongue, airway inflammation and if not treated rapidly with an epi-pen to reverse the immune system cellular destruction and fluid build up it resulted in organ damage and probable death by collapse of the respiratory system. Sydney tried to tell in my my terms at one point: Your entire body violently revolting, violently rioting against, attempting to expel a whisper in the breeze with a 50 megaton thermonuclear bomb and terminating itself in the process. Yet I write it here, like it was in my head then, read like a wikipedia article.

As I sat there, growing in temperature, in sweat, fidgeting in my own reaction, I had a moment of reflection of how different Sydney and I really were. Her body literally demanded a puritanical Pyrrhic purity at literally the first sign of a stressing agent. I fixated myself into a kind of stasis, hibernation but I was collecting something on me all the time, weighing down my mind slowly, killing me softly with every night I didn't sleep and every time that kept me from eating, from enjoying the breath in my lungs that I took for granted while she couldn't rely on it.

I didn't know what it all meant but when it crossed my mind that maybe it wouldn't even matter now something deep inside spurred me out of my seat and back to the nurses' counter to asked about Sydney.

I had been there four hours and I barely registered it. I had to wait another before I was informed her condition was upgraded to moderate but would need overnight observation. I was told she was lucky. She could receive visitors.

She was tethered to a few IV lines and sensors. Her face looked a little red and blotchy, her left eye could not open fully but otherwise she seemed okay. I had reverberations of my last visit with June as I walked in. All this talk of beds...this was the last one I'd want to sleep in. I struggled to lean into a gentle hug as she strained to connect.

“I'm so glad you're okay. I heard you were lucky.”

“Better lucky than good.” She wheezed back, “I saw your text about Brownie. Did you bring him?”

“Oh...no...it hadn't occurred to me.”

“It's okay.” Sydney squirmed, “I was wondering if you could go back and get him for me before they stop taking visitors for the night.”

“Of course, anything.” I pulled a chair from the side close to the bed.

“Thank you...I have something else I'd like you to do.”

“Sure, I'm guessing you'd like to call Gigi and let her know you're okay and need a few days off...”

“You've got to do the sage smudging in that place.”

I flopped back in the chair and tapped the legs with all of the fingers three or four times while exhaling, “Okay...” We've been through this before. I told her before I didn't believe in this stuff in particular and that if she wanted to do it, that's fine but...”

“The weird stuff going on in the apartment and my weird dreams. It's all because we are holding on to a piece of lost family and its manifesting itself there. It came to me as lay dying there. Please you have to do this for me before I come back.”

I threw my head back in the chair and exhaled loudly. At least it was better than her trying to get me to leave my decent job again, the ghosts either in the form of the winter's effects on the building or the delirium in her head from nearly being asphyxiated would pass. Now was not the time to make some kind of philosophical stand. “Okay.” I said, “Can do that.”

“You will that.”

“Yes. I will do that.”

I looked away, “hey, I'm glad you're here.” Sydney said.

“I'm glad you're here.”

“You're not going to do it, are you?”

“Um. Honestly, no.”

“Fine, I'll do it when I get out of here.”

“That's fine.”

“Everything is fine with you. Is there every anything right, with you, lately?”

“Sounds like that bothers you more than it bothers me and I don't get that.”

“Yeah that makes me sound like you, doesn't it?”

“You almost died, why are we fighting here?”

“Because I know what its like to fight for my life and I feel like I'm fighting for both of ours sometimes.”

“I could say the same thing?”

“Oh?”

“I made you that pouch that clips on to your jeans and disguises your epi-pen. Why don't you ever keep it on you like you're supposed to?”

She lifted her one free arm and slapped it down on the bed, “I don't know.”

“Well, its never a bad time to start a good habit.” I said, staring at her, “I'm going to go get Brownie. You want anything else?”

“A beer.”

“Heh. See you soon.”

I was tired from everything when I finally got back to the condo. The elevator was broken again so I was double tired by the time I pulled myself up the final step and leaned against my door for a second to rest. The moment I touched the door I felt an unease. I felt a little nauseous and weaker than I had been even a moment ago. I turned key and the knob and pushed in thinking all I needed some coffee and then to grab that stuffed animal and then I could get back here and sleep.

I stepped through the door and the air thick, hot, humid, tinged in ammonia again. I resigned myself to calling the landlord tomorrow to get someone out here to figure this out. I cracked the window again and started to make another cup of coffee for myself. I had some work emails backed up but I just shut my laptop.

There was a loud sucking sound that at first thought was coming from the coffee machine but it was coming from down the hall again. I sighed and wondered for a second if I should just do the sage thing myself at this point so I could move on to the part where I needed a decent plumber.

I pushed the door to the bedroom open and in the shadow of the hallway light and the darkness of the room I thought I saw it. The bed was a lump. A human shaped outline of a lump under the strewn covers. It was subtle like someone took a gingerbread man cookie cutter on the dough but didn't pop it out yet. I turned the lights on and it was gone. I blinked a few times. I hesitated but slowly touched the bed and pushed down on it a few times

Admittedly this one had my heart rate jump a bit. I shook my head realizing maybe it was a delayed command from earlier, But I stood guarded, my eyes locked on the bed, as I slunk around the far side to grab Brownie off of the window sill. There was some dirty condensation under the bear that I thought was weird but helped to underscore I needed to plastic wrap this window next.

My heart jumped again as the coffee machine gurgled in the kitchen. I shutoff the coffee pot and left. When I got back to the hospital I just missed the end of visiting hours for that wing so I asked the nurse to drop it off to Sydney. She texted me she got it and a kissy face emoji. I replied likewise and couldn't wait to try to sleep.

I woke up feeling refreshed. Intense dreams flicked in and out of my memory as the gray night brightened to a gray morning. I had this dream of little worms crawling up and around my face, through my nose, ears and mouth into my brain. One by one they went black, swelled with ooze and then carried it away into the soil. The soil turned dry and ashen that crumbled into four pieces and fled into the corners of vision, into nothing and then I dropped into oblivion.

Something exploded somewhere but that's okay. It was Saturday and I picked up Sydney from the hospital. She had a new epi-pen on her even though she had a bunch between the carrier I gave her and ones at her apartment and probably the one at mine. She had a poise and purpose to her even if she looked run down and still had a few pink blotches about her. I took her to her old place where she showered and changed clothes. Then she started to rummage through her disorganized closet for something.

“I'm gonna do this for you.” She insisted while unpacking a bundle of sage from a tie-dyed box in her apartment and then made a show of clipping on her epi-pen holster to me. “Mmmm. How stylish, C'mon let's go to your place.”

She sparked up my gas stove and ignited one end of the sage like a cigar and then blew out the weak flame before tracing the perimeter of the entire apartment and then tracing what she said was the names of the deceased in the air – June and Ralph.

“I know that I get a lot of feelings, sometimes,” she began, “but lately my dreams have been terrible, everything has been terrible and then almost dying its like, I saw something that needed to be sent away, thank you goodbye.”

I swallowed hard, “Well, thank you.”

“No, thank you,” She said amorously as she reached up to have her lips meet mine. “You know, there's one more thing we need to test out on that bed before we decide to keep it...” She whispered in my ticklish ear.

“Are you sure you're good to...”

“Yeah, come with me.”

I million thoughts and none thoughts fluttered through me and for some reason it struck me that I had not showered a few days and she just did, I kissed her, our tongues danced together like butterflies in a summer breeze. “Let me clean up a minute.”

She squeezed me, “Don't take too long.” She said taking off her sweater and under shirt revealing a red bra and her fit form before heading down to the hall to the bedroom.

I showered off in a mad dash, still dripping, I threw a towel across my waist so there was something to for her take off as well. I also most slipped on the wood boards of the hall as I pushed open the bedroom door.

In the light of the room I couldn't tell exactly what I was I seeing at first. I was just seeing Sydney's legs kicking violently in the air on the bed but her torso, neck and face were somehow fused in a vortex of blankets, sunken into the mattress. The entire mattress started to ungulate on its frame releasing violent hisses and gulps and gurgles as it banged the steel pivots and parts against the floor and each other. She kicked and twisted as I stood in horror unsure what to do as suddenly she was able to twist herself up and her face appear out of the dark bile colored yellow and ashen blue of the mattress. She took a huge gasp of breath and barely ecked out, “help me!” as it swallowed her again up to her legs.

The mattress swelled outside of its frame taking up more of the room, expanding in all directions except for mine. The mattress compressed and expanded and hissed and growled as it tried to totally swallow her up down to her toes. She punched one arm through that flailed in the air.

I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! Shoot through my head as she threw herself to the side as it had most of her now and she had been struggling for however long...maybe since I stepped int o the shower. She reached for her epi-pen on her side. The pouch fell off of her and to to the bed which bounced it off and it rolled to my feet.

I had an unorthodox hunch. I pried the cap up and exposed the point with the automatic plunger and in a back and forth in mind I jabbed. I jabbed the mattress with the pen. I felt the rattle of the internal spring vibrate through my hand knowing the device triggered successfully, injecting the mattress with adrenaline.

The mattress stretched wide, thin, and translucent, riddled with holes, knocking me down. My ears popped as it violently exploded all the air it had soaked up. I saw Sydney fall out of its grip, banging her elbow against the bed frame to the carpet, where she lay flat but visibly in pain. The mattress snapped back to a square with a vague humanoid outline, about a quarter of its original king size. Then it bound through the air like a rubber band snapped at its breaking point, it bounced off of the wall with a thud and then ping ponged through the hall as I pursued it. It shrunk again and shot itself through the tiny crack in the kitchen window, through which I watched it make one last bounce on the sands of the beach before plunging into the cloudy ocean, vanishing out of sight.

Little bits of liquid pooled up in its trail in the hall, in the kitchen, in the bedroom, they pooled up and turned into little streamers of gelatinous black sludge that smelled terrible and then seemed to boil away on their own, leaving only a fine bit of black, coffee grounds-like grains.

Sydney was mostly dressed clutching her elbow at the end of my hallway near the door. She was gasping and looked terrible all she could say was, “later.” and then walked out, slamming the door. I was too speechless and stunned to say anything back or chase after her.

That was a week ago. I tried texting, I tried calling, I tried knocking on her door, I tried flowers. I didn't hear anything from her and then she blocked me entirely. I considered seeing her at the bakery but I turned against that idea in the short term, hopefully, she could end the shock of what happened and we'd talk.

Outside of the jeopardy of our relationship was certainly in there was the other matter the 90 day trial of the mattress I no longer had possession of would be up soon and then I'd be paying for nothing...for something that I couldn't say had tried to eat my girlfriend and then jumped into the ocean. I searched the website for a way to break the contract and eventually I follow down a path to return a mattress and cancel my automatic payment as an unsatisfied customer. To my dismay, when I reached the bottom of how to reclaim the mattress, there were three options “Pick up at my current address on file” “Pick up at a new address” and “Other”.

I picked “Other”, my computer froze as a new screen on a five second timer appeared, “We understand that our product is not intended for everyone. Your invoice will be shredded and your card on file will be deleted. Better luck with a different product.” The U-Sea logo was watermarked across the page.

I couldn't get a screenshot and I was too baffled to get a shot of the screen with my phone – like it would proven anything if I did anyway.

Well, one problem was solved. Later that day I got a call from her bakery friend, Gigi, explaining she would send me a letter when she ready but that it was over between us and that I had to accept that. She concluded by saying she would come help me box up her stuff from my place.

So I'm slowly typing this up on my coach in the middle of another sleepless night. I guess I'll paraphrase her letter to you: “When I laid down into that bed the first time I saw nightmares and then that day we came back from the hospital I laid down on that bed and saw your spirit or maybe you'd prefer your brain, your mind, I'm now sure its the part of your mind where your job pools and rots and turns you into spiritual landfill, poisoning you from the inside out even as wear a mask to hide it, pretending like it also doesn't affect others. I can't make you quit for me. I tried that. I need you to quit for you but I don't think you will and I can't let myself be wrung out on and just there for whenever you feel like you can be there for us. I love you but I need you to love you too. Goodbye.”

I thought about it. I accepted Sydney isn't coming back. But that bed, from where it was taken from the unknown depths of the ocean was some kind of organism, a live sponge, if I were to take a guess. A sponge that could soak up the mental crap building up in a person and if it got too inundated wring it out on someone else or physically manifest it away. Maybe for the sake of this review, I shouldn't be telling this part but what the hell, I see you and now you see me. I got on the Rest EZ website, put in a different credit card and had a new bed shipped to a vacant unit in my complex on another 90 day free trial.

Honestly, I hadn't slept that care free in years. 5 out of 5 star rating.

1ptfkg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cockroaches/comments/1ptfkg1/cockroaches_in_espresso_maker_christmas_gift_gone/,Cockroaches in Espresso Maker — Christmas Gift Gone Wrong,"I decided to get my family an espresso maker for Christmas. I bought used 1) because even the lower cost machines are more than we usually spend on gifts and 2) because I generally try to buy things used as a matter of principle in our high consumption world. Plus, I live in New York where there is a high volume of people who ""got into coffee"" and end up deciding the hobby isn't for them, meaning there's a lot of good resale equipment on the cheap.

I picked up a Bambino for $200 from an NYU student in the East Village who was getting rid of the device before moving abroad for a semester. I tediously secured it in my carry on for the flight to Michigan and presented it to my parents yesterday morning ahead of Christmas so that we could spend the next few days perfecting our lattes.

Within an hour, my dad slapped a cockroach dead on our counter.

My parents are lucky enough to have little experience with cockroaches. My dad wasn't even sure it was a cockroach at first but I (a seasoned city dweller) knew immediately, and I knew we had a problem. I had slapped my own counter in New York where the Bambino had been sitting. You can tell yourself that 1 cockroach just caught a ride. But two, two is a sign that you have a problem. A quick google confirmed that yes, we definitely had a problem on our hands. Cockroaches love coffee makers, its their perfect environment: dark, tight, damp, and warm.

I had just gifted my parents an infestation.

Shockingly, my parents didn't immediately light the Bambino on fire. We did, however, immediately put it outside. And while I assured them I would absolutely take no issue if they just wanted to throw it away, against all odds they were prepared to fight for the dream of home brewed espresso.

Could Christmas be saved? Was the Bambino salvageable?

# What we did:

**1. Freeze them out:** I had read that freezing temps would make the roaches dormant and ultimately kill them. We left them outside overnight in freezing temps.

**2. Eviction:** next I opened up the Bambino and it wasn't a pretty sight. They had clearly set up shop in there for quite some time. We brushed out roach poop and then furiously shook and smacked the sides of the machine. The freezing temps had worked, and there were only carcasses remaining which came tumbling out. It was disturbing. My mom was my partner in crime, and I repeatedly emphasized I would not be offended if we threw the device out. But we persisted. Not all poo was possible to remove, and there are enough nooks and crannies I think its realistic to believe there may still be a carcass inside, but we did what we could. We agreed we didn't want to say how many roaches we found, but by my count it was roughly 8-10 plus 1 unhatched egg.

**3. Take no Prisoners:** in an abundance of caution we're now keeping the device in our chest freezer for 24 hrs at 0°F. I had read that the eggs may need lower temps to kill and we aren't taking any chances here. I can't be the one that introduces cockroaches for the first time into the home my parents have been in for over 30 years.

**4. Traps:** We're going to keep a Roach Motel next to the machine for the foreseeable future. Can't be too safe.

**5. Clean the system:** This is more for peace of mind. The roaches weren't in any of the water ways so the parts that matter were unaffected. But as another post said, you can bleach your machine but you can't bleach your brain.

# What we learned:

I've learned a lot in this experience, and want to help others not make the same mistake. Here are my recommendations:

* **Do you live in New York?** Keep a Roach Motel near your espresso maker. I am a firm believer that every building has roaches in New York, there is no getting rid of them there is only keeping them out of your living space. I already keep poison traps in my apartment but think the roach motel is the preferred method b/c I'd rather a poisoned roach not die in my machine.
* **Thinking about buying a used machine?** Ask if the owner has had any history of roaches. If you can, it may not be a bad idea to ask to see the inside before you buy it.
* **Are you a frequent facebook marketplace / resale buyer like me?** Coffee makers are especially attractive to roaches but so are electronics in general. I'm going to be way more skeptical and ask a lot more questions anytime I'm thinking about buying something.

Are we crazy? I think we are, but we're also proud, resourceful midwesterners, willing to roll up our shirt sleeves. I hope this post helps prevent your treasured espresso makers from becoming roach residences. And god forbid you repeat my mistakes and find this after buying an infested machine, I hope you find my experience helpful.

Was it worth it? Ask me on Christmas morning as I sip a cappuccino. Maybe yes, maybe no.

My terms were that I would be promoted to Deputy Head of Department and receive some direct reports. Six months later I receive a promotion to ""senior Manager"" and a pay rise that was a bit less than my other offer, but promised that a big restructure was coming and I would be promoted then and receive a further pay rise and people management responsibilities then 

Last week we got the promised big restructure and I was promoted after a fairly pointless interview process...to ""Team Lead""...for a whopping £1k a year more than my offer at the sister company 2 years ago. 

I was moaning to a friend/neutral party in the industry about how insulted I felt and how I was going to have to fight tooth and nail for a job title more reflective of the new role and my work over the past 2 years and how the money really wasn't sustainable for me and she let slip that she'd heard a rumour that my company had put a cap on what the sister company could offer me, which completely explains all the shadiness around pay. I've since confirmed this through a trusted source and I'm just floored.

I feel so stupid, like I've let myself be played and they've gotten 2 years of hard graft out of me and think I'll just be happy with piecemeal increases when I could be soaring elsewhere. So I'm really glad to find this community because I want to find something FAST, mainly so I can get my career back on track but also because I want my current company to know that they can't keep good people by treating them like this.

Sorry for the rant, I'm just so angry! But plan to use that anger to fuel my search.

Actions taken:
-Reached out to Managing Director at sister company to arrange coffee in January - they don't have a position open but feel I need to explain that I'd still love to work with them if/when something comes up
-Updated CV and applied for HoD role at another company 
-Started shortlisting jobs outside of my industry, but am struggling to know how to communicate that my role is as senior as it is without an actual Associate Director/Director title

1ptfin0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ptfin0/cockroaches_in_espresso_maker_christmas_gift_gone/,Cockroaches in Espresso Maker — Christmas Gift Gone Wrong,"I decided to get my family an espresso maker for Christmas. I bought used 1) because even the lower cost machines are more than we usually spend on gifts and 2) because I generally try to buy things used as a matter of principle in our high consumption world. Plus, I live in New York where there is a high volume of people who ""got into coffee"" and end up deciding the hobby isn't for them, meaning there's a lot of good resale equipment on the cheap. 

I picked up a Bambino for $200 from an NYU student in the East Village who was getting rid of the device before moving abroad for a semester. I tediously secured it in my carry on for the flight to Michigan and presented it to my parents yesterday morning ahead of Christmas so that we could spend the next few days perfecting our lattes. 

Within an hour, my dad slapped a cockroach dead on our counter. 

My parents are lucky enough to have little experience with cockroaches. My dad wasn't even sure it was a cockroach at first but I (a seasoned city dweller) knew immediately, and I knew we had a problem. I had slapped my own counter in New York where the Bambino had been sitting. You can tell yourself that 1 cockroach just caught a ride. But two, two is a sign that you have a problem. A quick google confirmed that yes, we definitely had a problem on our hands. Cockroaches love coffee makers, its their perfect environment: dark, tight, damp, and warm. 

I had just gifted my parents an infestation. 

Shockingly, my parents didn't immediately light the Bambino on fire. We did, however, immediately put it outside. And while I assured them I would absolutely take no issue if they just wanted to throw it away, against all odds they were prepared to fight for the dream of home brewed espresso.

Could Christmas be saved? Was the Bambino salvageable? 

# What we did:

**1. Freeze them out:** I had read that freezing temps would make the roaches dormant and ultimately kill them. We left them outside overnight in freezing temps.

**2. Eviction:** next I opened up the Bambino and it wasn't a pretty sight. They had clearly set up shop in there for quite some time. We brushed out roach poop and then furiously shook and smacked the sides of the machine. The freezing temps had worked, and there were only carcasses remaining which came tumbling out. It was disturbing. My mom was my partner in crime, and I repeatedly emphasized I would not be offended if we threw the device out. But we persisted. Not all poo was possible to remove, and there are enough nooks and crannies I think its realistic to believe there may still be a carcass inside, but we did what we could. We agreed we didn't want to say how many roaches we found, but by my count it was roughly 8-10 plus 1 unhatched egg. 

**3. Take no Prisoners:** in an abundance of caution we're now keeping the device in our chest freezer for 24 hrs at 0°F. I had read that the eggs may need lower temps to kill and we aren't taking any chances here. I can't be the one that introduces cockroaches for the first time into the home my parents have been in for over 30 years.

**4. Traps:** We're going to keep a Roach Motel next to the machine for the foreseeable future.  Can't be too safe.

**5. Clean the system:** This is more for peace of mind. The roaches weren't in any of the water ways so the parts that matter were unaffected. But as another post said, you can bleach your machine but you can't bleach your brain. 

# What we learned:

I've learned a lot in this experience, and want to help others not make the same mistake. Here are my recommendations:

* **Do you live in New York?** Keep a Roach Motel near your espresso maker. I am a firm believer that every building has roaches in New York, there is no getting rid of them there is only keeping them out of your living space. I already keep poison traps in my apartment but think the roach motel is the preferred method b/c I'd rather a poisoned roach not die in my machine.
* **Thinking about buying a used machine?** Ask if the owner has had any history of roaches. If you can, it may not be a bad idea to ask to see the inside before you buy it. 
* **Are you a frequent facebook marketplace / resale buyer like me?** Coffee makers are especially attractive to roaches but so are electronics in general. I'm going to be way more skeptical and ask a lot more questions anytime I'm thinking about buying something. 

Are we crazy? I think we are, but we're also proud, resourceful midwesterners, willing to roll up our shirt sleeves. I hope this post helps prevent your treasured espresso makers from becoming roach residences. And god forbid you repeat my mistakes and find this after buying an infested machine, I hope you find my experience helpful. 

Was it worth it? Ask me on Christmas morning as I sip a cappuccino. Maybe yes, maybe no.",0,1766449184.0,espresso,7,0.33,False

There's a Witch in the garage

Part 2 

""I don't know how you can sleep in this house, man,"" Alex said, his voice hushed like he didn’t want it to carry too far. We were sitting in my room, it was a saturday afternoon. 

""What am I supposed to do?"" I shot back, a little sharper than I intended.

He shook his head, grimacing. ""I’d rather be homeless, dude. Seriously. I’d take my chances with a cardboard box and alley cats before sleeping under this roof again.""

I had just told Alex everything.The dream, the shadow in the garage, the deadbolt clicking in the middle of the night, and the way my dad drifted through the dark like he wasn’t quite real.

""You’ve been in the garage though, right?"" he asked, squinting at me like he was searching for some kind of lie I hadn’t confessed yet.

""Of course I have. I’ve been in there a million times. It’s just a normal garage.""

Even as the words left my mouth, they felt sour and thin. That wasn’t the whole truth. Not even close. I knew it, maybe Alex did too. 

Yes, I had been in the garage—but only ever through the overhead doors or the rear entrance, the one that looks out into the backyard. Never, not once in my nearly fifteen years of life, had I stepped through the red door that connected the garage to the house. Not from the kitchen. Not from the hall. Not from anywhere inside. That door might as well have been bricked over in my mind.

And I had known this was strange for a long time. I had known.

But saying it out loud, or even really admitting it to myself felt like pulling a trigger on something that couldn’t be undone. Because if I accepted that, then I had to accept something far worse: that my father wasn’t who he said he was.

And I don’t know which truth is harder to live with.

Either there’s a witch in the garage. Or there’s a monster in the house.

""Did you ever try to do what Danny did?"" Alex asked, his voice low, almost like he didn’t want the question to echo in the room.

""What do you mean?"" I replied, even though I had a feeling I already knew.

""Well, Danny stood by the garage door, right? And the witch spoke to him. Have you ever tried that?""

I had. More than once, in fact. Over the years, I’d lingered around the garage, sometimes standing still for long stretches of time, sometimes pacing back and forth just outside the red door, hoping and dreading that I might hear something. But either nothing happened or my dad always seemed to appear, needing my help with something. A chore. A question. A distraction.

I was explaining all this to Alex when we both froze at the soft knock on my bedroom door.

My dad’s head poked around the frame a second later.

""Hey guys,"" he said with his usual relaxed smile. ""We’re heading to the dump to drop off some old stuff. Found a box of your things from when you were little. Mind going through it and pulling anything you want to keep?""

He placed the box in my hands without waiting for an answer, then turned and walked away.

""Sure,"" I said flatly to the empty hallway.

We sat cross-legged on the floor as I peeled open the flaps of the old cardboard box. A puff of dust lifted into the air, catching the light like ash. Inside were old plastic toys with missing arms, a faded baseball cap, and a small trophy that read “3rd Place - Karate.”

""When did you do karate?"" Alex asked with a smirk, clearly holding back laughter.

""Don’t mess with me, man. I’ll sweep your legs,"" I said, making a ridiculous chopping motion in the air.

We both laughed and kept digging. The box was a time capsule of forgotten odds and ends. Stickers, marbles, bits of colored string, a yo-yo that no longer lit up. At the very bottom were a stack of drawings, folded and crumpled, their paper soft with age. Most were harmless, dogs, fish, some scribbles that might’ve been superheroes or dinosaurs. We joked about my artistic skills, flipping through them one by one.

Then Alex went quiet.

He held a drawing in his hand, staring at it for too long. The amusement drained from his face.

""You have a sister?"" he asked, his tone suddenly cautious.

""No,"" I said, hesitating. ""Why?""

He turned the drawing toward me.

It was a simple picture, the kind any little kid would draw. A house made of a square and a triangle, smoke curling from a cartoon chimney, the sun in the corner, a patch of green grass. In front of the house stood four stick figures. One small, probably meant to be me. One tall, broad-shouldered figure, definitely my dad. One with a dress and long brown lines for hair, my mom. And then... another woman. Same size as my mom. Same long hair. Standing just a few steps apart, like she belonged there.

Alex pointed at them, slowly. ""Kid. Dad. Mom... Mom?""

My stomach turned. I could hear the soft creak of my father’s footsteps coming down the hallway.

Without a word, I grabbed the drawing and slid it under the bed.

Dad stepped into the room just as I finished. ""Find anything you want to keep?"" he asked, eyes flicking between us.

""No,"" I said quickly, loading everything back into the box.

He nodded, cheerful as ever. ""Alright then. We’ll be back in an hour or so.""

""Okay."" I didn’t look at him.

Something in the air shifted. His smile dipped for half a second, just a flicker but I saw it. He was reading the room.

""Be good,"" he said, and then he was gone.

We listened as the front door opened and shut, the car doors slammed, and the engine disappeared down the street.

""Was that a drawing of the witch?"" Alex finally said, his voice rising with disbelief.

""It was just a drawing,"" I said too quickly, searching for any kind of reasonable explanation but nothing came. My mind was blank.

""A drawing of a son, a dad, a mom, and... another mom,"" Alex said again, slower this time.

We stared at each other, the room suddenly too quiet. The air felt heavier.

Under the bed, the paper lay dormant.

I reached under and lifted the paper. 

I started to speak slowly “Kid, Dad, Mom”

“Witch” Alex cut me off. 

Alex doesn’t sleep over anymore. Not that night. Not since.

He says it’s because of school, or his parents, or just needing a break, but I know better. I think we both do. The house feels different now. There’s something heavy in the air, something unspoken, a secret hideousness. My mom and dad still move through our days like everything’s fine. We eat dinner together. We laugh. We talk about nothing. But it all feels rehearsed, like lines read from a script in a play no one wants to watch.

A performance, not a life.

And my dad, he knows something. I can feel it in the way he looks at me sometimes, like he’s checking to see if I know too. And I do. I don’t know what, not exactly, but I know enough to know that nothing is what it seems. And I think he knows that I know.

Last night, I had another dream.

No, not a dream. A memory wearing a dream’s skin.

I was crying. Alone. At the bottom of something. A pit maybe, a hole carved deep into the earth. I was sitting on a slick, rotting heap of garbage. Wet cardboard, plastic, food wrappers bloated with decay. The air stank of mildew and something far worse, like meat left out too long.

It was cold. My skin ached. My body throbbed with a dull, steady pain that pulsed like a heartbeat. The darkness was thick, almost physical. But then. Click. A light above snapped on.

A spotlight.

A single circle of harsh white light opened far above me. I looked up and saw bricks curving around me like the inside of a well, rising twenty feet or more. I was in a tunnel or a shaft, some place meant to hold things. Or trap them.

I heard footsteps above me. Muffled. Slow. Methodical. They echoed strangely, as though they were underwater. I realized I could no longer hear my own crying. My mouth was open, my face soaked in tears, but there was no sound. Like the world had turned down the volume.

Then the light dimmed slightly, something was standing over the opening.

A silhouette. A head. Someone was looking down at me.

I didn’t move. Couldn’t. My breath caught in my throat as the figure lifted a hand and gave a gentle wave. Familiar. Too familiar.

In the other hand, they held a brown paper bag. They let it drop.

It struck my shoulder before sliding to the floor. I opened it with shaking hands.

Two slices of pizza.

Cold, greasy, and smeared against the inside of the bag—but I devoured them without thinking. My hunger roared to the surface like a beast. I had been starving. Starving for longer than I could understand.

The figure stood above me, still and silent. Then they stepped away.

Their shadow receded from the light, and the footsteps returned, fading like a lullaby played backward.

Click.

The light went out.

Nothing but darkness. Absolute. I couldn’t see my hands. Couldn’t feel the floor beneath me. Just the cold. The wet. The black.

And somewhere in that black, I kept crying, soundless, voiceless, waiting for the next bag to fall.

I awoke the way I always do now. Soaked in sweat, heart pounding so violently I could feel it in my throat. 

I turned my head toward the alarm clock. That familiar red light burned through the darkness, too sharp to look at directly, bleeding into the walls and ceiling like a warning.

3:04 a.m.

I found myself wondering if my dad was awake.

What a strange, grim thought.

Who wants to be awake at this hour? What is there to do in the dead middle of the night but wait for something to go wrong?

Still, I got up. Wide awake. My stomach clawed at me with a hollow ache, like the hunger from my dream had followed me across the threshold of sleep and into this world.

I turned on the light. No need for stealth, I wasn’t sneaking around. I was just hungry. That was all.

I made my way to the kitchen, passing the dining table without thinking. The fridge greeted me with a dull hum. Cold air spilled over my bare feet as I opened it.

We had pizza yesterday.

Pizza is my favorite. It’s what I ask for every time my parents let me choose dinner. A little ritual of comfort. Predictable.

But the box was empty.

Completely, insultingly empty.

I sighed. Mom hates when we do that. Leave containers behind with nothing inside. She acts like it’s a betrayal of the home itself, some grave violation. I found it quite funny actually. Along with the empty pizza box in the fridge there was also a bag of Salt was left out on the counter. Mom would be so pissed.  

I figured Dad must’ve eaten the last of it. I shut the door and pivoted to Plan B. Ramen noodles. 

“What are you doing up?”

My father’s voice, casual, calm.

My body reacted before my brain did. I physically jumped, feet leaving the ground. A shock of pure fear surged through me like a live wire.

He was sitting at the dining table.

In the dark.

He’d been there the whole time. Watched me walk by. Watched me open the fridge. Watched me searching, unaware of the eyes fixed on my back.

“Jesus Christ, Dad,” I gasped, clutching at my chest.

He didn’t smile. Didn’t laugh. Just sat there, watching me. His face empty, unreadable.

Then, slowly, like remembering how to perform, a grin spread across his mouth.

“Sorry, son,” he said gently. “Didn’t mean to scare you.”

I nodded, swallowing down the last of my panic, trying to find the edges of composure.

“I was just... hungry,” I said. “Wanted some pizza.”

“That’s gone,” he replied.

There was something strange about how he said it. Not annoyed. Not apologetic. Just final.

“Did you eat it?” I asked.

“I just told you,” he said, smile unwavering. “It’s gone. Who else would’ve eaten it?”

I wanted to say nothing. I wanted to let it drop.

“The witch in the garage,” I said flatly.

He didn’t move.

Five, maybe ten seconds passed. Then he laughed. A weak, fake laugh like someone trying to mimic the sound without really feeling it.

“Yeah,” he said. “Maybe.”

He stood up, slowly. He looked at the table for a long moment, then lifted his gaze to meet mine. His eyes were glassy, unreadable.

“Sam,” he began, voice low. “There’s a lot of darkness in this world.”

The words hit me like a crack of thunder, sudden, loud, impossible to ignore.

It was the first time I had ever heard my father speak without his usual mask. There was no warmth in his tone. Just truth.

“There are things out there,” he continued, “that are hard to explain. Things that don’t make sense. Things I hope you never have to understand.”

He paused.

“But maybe one day you will have to.”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. I was rooted in place. Frozen.

“What are you trying to say?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He looked down, muttered something I didn’t catch. Then he spoke clearly again.

“Everything I do,” he said, “I do for you and your mother.”

I didn’t know how to respond.

“Okay,” I murmured. What else was there to say?

“I love you, Sam,” he said.

“I love you too, Dad,” I replied, throat tight.

He smirked, not smiled, smirked. A quick exhale coming from his nose. 

“Dad,” I said slowly, cautiously, “if I ask you something... do you promise to tell me the truth?”

He looked at me. Really looked. Then raised both hands and rubbed his face, slowly, like wiping something invisible from his skin.

“Yes, Sam,” he said, and this time his voice was grave. “You can ask me a question.”

He emphasized the word ‘A’ as if to make it clear I only got one.

Just one.

My body began to tremble. I didn’t know why. I was only a boy, standing in front of his father. A scene that should have been safe. Familiar.

But something was wrong.

“Is the witch real?” I asked, keeping my voice steady.

“Yes, Sam,” he said. “The witch is real.”

Then he turned and walked back toward his bedroom. No explanation. No fear.

Just silence.

There were so many questions I could have asked him.  
 Do we have a basement?  
 Was there ever someone else in our family?  
 Is the witch in a well?

But I panicked. My chest was tight, my thoughts were spiraling, and I asked the first thing that came to mind.

“He said it was real?” Alex repeated, barely above a whisper.

We sat together at lunch, shoulders hunched forward, our voices low. The world around us was loud, kids yelling, laughing, the clatter of trays, but it all felt distant. Sounded like we were underwater again.

“Yeah,” I muttered.

He looked at me, eyes wide. “Your dad said that? Just like that?”

I nodded, not offering more.

Alex stared down at his untouched sandwich. “Anything else happen?”

“Not really,” I said. “Just more nightmares.”

I didn’t want to talk about it anymore. Every time I brought it up, every time I said the word witch or garage or red door, I felt like something drained out of me. I wasn’t even afraid anymore, just tired. Worn out from the weight of secrets I didn’t understand.

Danny walked past us in the cafeteria, surrounded by his usual group. He caught my eye and gave a friendly nod. He looked normal. Happy. But I knew he wasn’t. How could he be? I've never seen the witch, never heard her, and she spoke to him. 

Later, Alex invited me to spend the weekend at his place. Play video games. Watch dumb movies. Fall asleep at 4am like we used to. I told him I wasn’t up for it. I just wanted to sleep.

That was a lie.

When I got home, I sat in my room, staring at the picture. The one from the box. The drawing with the square house, the triangle roof, and four figures standing out front.

“A kid. A dad. A mom. And... a mom.” I said aloud.

My voice sounded small in the quiet room.

I could hear my real mom in the kitchen, pans clinking, the faint hiss of something frying in oil. She was humming softly to herself.

I walked out and stood in the kitchen doorway. She looked over, smiling. “Hey sweetheart. Everything okay?”

I hesitated, then handed her the picture. “I found this in that old box Dad gave me.”

She took it, holding it gently between her fingers like it might crumble. “Aw, Sam... This is adorable. I forgot how much you used to draw. You were so creative.”

I stared at her. “Mom. Why are there two women in the drawing?”

She blinked. “Two?”

I pointed. “There. That one’s you. That one’s Dad. That’s me. who’s *she*?”

Her face didn’t change. No flash of fear, no confusion. Just a calm, almost practiced smile.

“Oh, I don’t know, honey. You had such a wild imagination as a kid. Maybe you wanted a sister, or maybe she was a friend. You used to make up stories all the time, remember?”

I didn’t respond.

“She looks exactly like you,” I said. My voice was flat.

Mom chuckled softly. “Well, they’re stick figures, Sam. How different could she look?”

She had a point. But it didn’t feel right.

“Is everything okay?” she asked again, tilting her head. Her voice was so gentle, so sincere. And for a moment, I felt safe. For the first time in weeks.

But maybe that was the plan.

My mind started racing. I saw flashes of memory. A dark hallway. The sound of a latch. A smell like wet brick and iron. Things I had ignored for years. Weird noises. Locked doors. The red door.

There was a truth hiding behind the drywall of this house. It had been growing in the walls like mold since I was a child.

“Have you ever gone through the red door, Mom?” I asked.

She looked up from the picture and laughed, confused. “The red door? In the garage?”

“Yes.”

“Of course, Sam. We were in there last week, remember? We moved those boxes together.” She gave me a puzzled look and shook her head.

“That’s not what I asked.”

She paused. Her smile faltered, just a little.

“I asked,” I said again, “if you’ve ever *gone* through the red door.”

“Sam, the red door leads to the garage,” she said, her voice suddenly firm.

“Does it?” I took a step forward. My voice was shaking now. “So we don’t have a basement? That door just goes to the garage and nowhere *else*?”

“Of course not,” she said quickly. Too quickly.

“Then why are there *locks* on both sides of it?” I snapped. “Why does it lock from the inside and the outside, Mom?”

She stared at me. Her eyes began to shimmer. A tear rolled down her cheek.

“Sam...” she whispered. “Please, stop. You’re scaring me.”

“No,” I said. “*Dad* is the one who’s scaring me. I know he’s hiding something. I know you are too.”

She stepped forward and reached out. “Sweetheart, you’re not well. Maybe it’s just the nightmares, or stress, or”

“I’m not crazy,” I hissed. “You’re just good at pretending.”

“Sam, please,” she said, her voice trembling. “You need help. You’re saying things that aren’t real.”

I backed away from her, from the kitchen, from her soft eyes that looked more like lies than comfort now.

She stood there holding the drawing in her hand. The one with the fourth figure. The one she didn’t name.

The woman in the picture was still smiling.  
 And I didn’t know who she was.  
 But she looked a lot like my mother.

After the fight, I went back to my room and shut the door behind me. The air felt heavier now. Still. Like the house was holding its breath. I sat on the edge of my bed, elbows on my knees, just waiting for the sound of the front door opening, for his footsteps, for something.

Dad always got home around 5:30. Like clockwork.

But 5:30 came and went.

Then 6:00.

Then 6:45.

The sun had vanished by then, and the blue twilight outside was starting to curdle into full night. I checked the time again. 7:00. Nothing.

At 7:10 p.m., the phone rang.

It was a sharp, old-fashioned sound. Like something out of a dream, or a nightmare.

I heard my mom pick it up in the hallway. A few seconds of silence. Then a small, fractured whimper slipped out of her mouth. My skin stood up. 

“Wait, what? No, no, no, what happened?” she stammered.

That was enough. My anger toward her evaporated. She might’ve been hiding something, but she was still my mother, and right now, she sounded like a frightened child. I stepped out into the hallway just as she was pulling on her coat with frantic, jerky movements.

“Mom?” I asked, my voice thin. “What’s going on?”

She turned to me, eyes red, phone still clutched in her hand.

“There’s been an accident,” she said. Her voice cracked on the last word.

There were tears already, but I didn’t know if they were from me, or the phone call, or both. The details came during the drive. Barely strung-together thoughts between panicked breaths.

“Your father was in a car crash,” she said. “They said a truck. Some truck hit him. A bad one. He’s at the hospital.”

I said nothing. Just watched the blur of passing headlights and shadows out the window. Everything felt slowed down. Muffled. Like I’d been dropped underwater. An unfortunately familiar feeling for me recently. 

When we got to the hospital, I found out what really happened. He’d been sideswiped by a truck, some distracted driver on his phone, apparently. The driver walked away with a broken wrist. But Dad… Dad had taken the full impact. They put him into a medically induced coma “for his own safety,” the doctors said. Their voices were calm. Practiced. Rehearsed for hundreds of nights like this one.

I listened in pieces. It was all just noise—soft voices, sliding doors, papers shuffling. I didn’t cry. I didn’t feel much of anything. If anything, I felt absent. Like I’d slipped a few feet outside of my own body. Watching a movie I didn’t want to see.

We waited. For hours.

Sympathetic looks came from every direction. Nurses smiled with sad eyes. Doctors patted shoulders and used the word Champ. No one said it out loud, but everyone in that waiting room knew what kind of night this was.

My mom barely spoke. She held a balled-up tissue in one hand, trembling, as if it were the only thing tethering her to this reality. I wanted to comfort her. But I didn’t move. I just stared ahead. Thinking about the last conversation I’d had with Dad. The *only* honest one we might have ever had. I had asked him a question. One question. And I got an answer I didn’t understand. Now I felt like I may never speak with him again. 

They let us see him at 11:04 p.m.

I remember the exact time, because I looked at the red digital clock in the hallway and felt a jolt, just like the alarm clock in my room. Red numbers. Always red. 

The room was filled with a quiet symphony of mechanical life support. A soft, pulsing beep. The sound of suction. An oxygen machine that sighed and inhaled, like something alive. Like something waiting.

He was lying there. My dad.

His face was covered in a cascade of bruises and shallow cuts. There were bandages, dried blood at the edges, IVs in both arms. But it was still him. Still *Dad*. Not broken. Just… still.

“Hey,” my mom whispered, stepping toward him like he might wake at the sound.

I stood behind her. Frozen.

The machines beeped, slow and steady, like a metronome counting the seconds of life passing by. 

 felt something shift in my chest. Not sadness exactly. Something colder.

His clothes were folded neatly in a clear plastic bin labeled with a thin white tag. Personal Effects it read. Something about that phrase made my stomach turn. Like he was already gone.

I wasn’t supposed to look. But I did.

Among the blood-speckled shirt and crumpled jeans, I saw something gleam faintly in the harsh hospital lighting, something metallic, half-buried in the folds. My heart jumped.

Keys.

I glanced at Mom. She was standing at the edge of Dad’s bed, wiping her eyes, trying to be brave. Trying to look strong for both of us. But I wasn’t watching her out of sympathy. I was watching her to make sure she didn’t see me.

I reached down casually, slid my hand into the container, and felt around until my finger looped through the keyring. I closed my hand tightly, muffling the soft jingle of metal, and slipped the whole thing into my coat pocket in one smooth motion. Cold steel. Heavy with purpose.

“Hey, Mom,” I said, forcing a tremble into my voice like I was holding back tears.

“Yes, hun?” she replied quickly, looking over her shoulder with a practiced smile. It didn’t touch her eyes.

“Could I, could I get some water or something?” I asked, fumbling for more words, trying to sell it. “Maybe step outside for a minute. Just… some air.”

She nodded without hesitation. “Of course. That’s probably a good idea,” she said, brushing at her cheeks with a tissue. “Go ahead. I’ll be right here.”

I turned and walked out without another word. The second I was in the hallway, I picked up speed, not running, but not walking slow enough to get stopped. My thoughts were loud. Deafening. The keys felt like they were burning a hole in my pocket.

I found the first staff member I could, an older woman behind a counter, peering at a screen and sipping from a hospital-branded coffee cup.

“Hi,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Is Mrs. Pierce working tonight?”

She looked at me, surprised, then nodded and picked up a phone. A few short calls. A few moments of waiting.

Then, around the corner, she appeared.

Alex’s mom.

“Oh, Sam,” she said, walking up with open arms, “I heard what happened. I’m so, so sorry, sweetheart.”

Her hug was warm, but I didn’t feel it. 

She pulled back, keeping her hands gently on my shoulders.

“Your dad’s strong. And this hospital’s one of the best. The doctors here…” she gave me a little smile, trying to lift the moment, “they’re basically wizards, you know?”

“Or witches,” I said, without thinking. The words slid out, dry and bitter.

“Could you give me a ride home?” I asked. 

After telling Mom that Mrs. Pierce would be driving me home, we left. It was a long, silent ride. I didn’t try to talk much, and I couldn’t have told you anything she said if you asked me. I was somewhere else, already halfway down the hallway, staring at the red door in my mind.

I got home around midnight. The house looked the same, but it felt completely different. My own house had never scared me like this. It was too quiet, too dark. But not empty.

Something was still inside. I knew it.

I unlocked the front door. My hand trembled. As I stepped inside, I had this vivid flash, just for a moment of something standing in the garage window, waving.

I didn’t lock the door behind me.

I walked slowly through the quiet house. Past the kitchen. Past the living room. Down the long hallway.

Until I stood before the red door.

That door had been a shadow cast across my entire childhood. A question no one ever answered. A giant red threat dressed up like a little white lie. 

My hand reached up, almost on its own. I slid the deadbolt open. I inserted my father’s key into the lock and turned. It clicked.

I paused. I prayed, silently, foolishly, that I’d open the door and see nothing but a garage. My father’s dusty old pickup. Tools. Paint cans. Normal things.

I opened the door.

Behind it was a narrow space. A short passage. On the other side was another identical red door.

To the right: a thin, crumbling staircase made of old brick, leading down into pitch-black darkness. A single metal chain dangled from the ceiling like a forgotten noose.

I pulled it. Click.

The lights buzzed and flickered to life, revealing the start of something ancient. Something hidden.

Each step I took down the stairs made the air feel heavier, thicker, older. Like I was walking into something that had been sealed away for centuries. At the bottom of the steps was a small stone corridor. Around the corner, I entered a large underground room.

It was damp and cold, and it reeked like rot and mildew and death. The walls were stone, stained dark. The floor was littered with trash: torn food wrappers, pizza boxes, old cans, and bags of salt.

And in the center of the room… was a well.

A stone well, about three feet high, open and roofless, like something torn out of a fairytale, but there was nothing magical about it. It was surrounded by a perfect circle of white salt.

Until I stepped too close and accidentally kicked some of the salt away, breaking the ring.

That’s when I heard it.

“Hello…” came a voice from inside the well.

I stumbled back, gasping.

“Hello?” I answered, my voice shaking.

“Who's there?” the voice asked, hoarse and ragged.

“S-Sam,” I said, barely able to get the word out.

“Will you help me, Sam?”

The voice sounded scared. Tired. Human. Not some cackling hag like I had imagined all my life. It was a woman. A person.

“So you're real,” I said, eyes welling up with terrified tears. “There really is a witch...”

The voice whimpered. “I'm not a witch, Sam.” She was crying now, deep, anguished sobs echoing up from the stone. “I'm a prisoner.”

I couldn’t speak. My hands were shaking violently.

“Your father… he's kept me down here for years. Please. Help me.”

“Who are you?” I finally managed to ask.

“My name is Sarah,” the voice said. “I’m Danny’s mother.”

The room spun. My knees buckled. My breath caught in my throat.

Danny’s mother. The one who’d *disappeared*. The one they said *ran away*. The one Danny never talked about.

“Wait here,” I said, voice cracking. “I’m going to call the police. I’m going to call Danny.”

“No, wait,” she pleaded. “Sometimes… sometimes your father lowers a rope for food or clothes, when he’s feeling merciful. It’s already tied. Please, just drop it down. I've been down here far too long.”

I grabbed the coil of rope from the corner. It was already anchored to the wall, knotted expertly like it had been used many times before.

I tossed it into the well.

“I’ll be right back,” I promised, already running, sprinting up the stairs, through the red door, slamming it shut behind me out of instinct. My hands flew across drawers and cupboards until I found the small phone book my mom still kept.

*Danny - Home.*

I dialed the number. My heart was in my throat. The phone rang.

“Hello?” Danny answered.

“Danny, it’s Sam,” I gasped, tears flooding my face.

“Oh hey, man, what’s up?”

“I found her,” I cried. “Your mom. She didn’t leave. She didn’t run away. She’s here, Danny. She’s been under my house this whole time.”

There was silence on the other end.

Then, finally, Danny laughed, but not a happy laugh. A confused one.

“Sam… my mom’s in rehab.”

“No. No, she’s not. I just talked to her. She said that my dad locked her away. Danny, you said she disappeared”

“She did man. Years ago. She was gone for a while, but she came back. She’s getting better now. I saw her last weekend. We go visit every other Sunday.”

My breath stopped.

The phone slipped from my hand and hit the kitchen floor with a dull crack.

Downstairs… in the dark… a rope was being pulled taut.

And someone…  something was climbing up.",1,1766449006.0,u_VnhedoniV,0,1.0,False

I put my head down and had that long series of intense dreams followed by jarring injections of wakefulness until about 520 when I gave up and made an extra large pot of extra strong coffee and decided to start my day early. I sighed when I got no reply from Sydney and my news alerts box began to overflow with news of some of kind of Middle East rocket attack. I drank deeply of my coffee and rubbed my eyes resigned that this was going to be one of those days.

After putting in an effort to move the ball on the rocket attack data, I emailed my boss and said I still had heating issues at home and I needed another half work from day. My phone buzzed but I was taken back by a sudden blast of heat wafting into the kitchen. It felt like someone had suddenly opened an oven but I wasn't running the oven or any other appliance other than the coffee maker. It was an uncomfortable swelling heat that took on a worse life as fishy ammonia smell polluted the morning. I was forced to take down the seals on one of the windows let some fresh air. As before the strange heat and the smells did not last long but I didn't know where they were coming from.

As I was running track around the apartment sniffing for the origin of the smell, pressing my hand on every appliance, every surface high and low for the source of the heat I hear a loud rush of air, followed by a loud groan and then what sounded like the bedroom door slam against the wall. This actually caused me to jump. I pinched myself to double check I'm not asleep before my laptop at the kitchen table as I round the corner of the hall to the bedroom. Everything looked awry but that's the way I left it. I couldn't even tell if that loud sound was the door or not.

At this point I'm still half way in my work and then half way chasing ghosts when I jump again at the sound of my phone buzzing on the kitchen table. I swing around to the laptop when the air turned cold and I shut the window. Then I heard low stomach growling and rumbling noise from down the hallway again.

“Okay.” I can't say I'm a big fan of Reddit, it is a fairly unreliable source for my job and I treat it that way for everything else but I felt like it was time to trouble shoot the bed and since their hot line was still inactive and their website offered very little else relevant to my issues, it was time to see what else was out there. I had a feeling that forums on the bed itself would be well manicured but the U-Sea company or one of their affiliates might be raw so I started there.

There wasn't much, only a few posts about how the range of their products are nautical and some of them are intended to be food and preserved by cold while others are not food and are preserved with a variety of chemicals and there could be some cross contamination.

I had the Rest EZ tab open and for the first time in this trial period I opened the recall item page and floated the cursor over it. I ran the numbers in my head. I've lived here less than two months, plenty of things were going on and the correlation between the strange goings on and the bed were not proven, not even close. What was important was how much better the bed made me feel, save for last night. I shook my head, there was higher chance of finding a ouija board Sydney had been using to try to contact her dad than something this bed was doing and so I closed the tab. “Not even close.” I muttered to myself in the kitchen.

My phone rang a third time and this time I actually looked at the number. I didn't recognize it so I hit end. I rubbed my eyes again and saw then looked through my phone history and saw it was the same number 3 times. I started typing in the number when my phone rang again and this time it was number I knew, it was Gigi, Sydney's friend who worked with her at the bakery.

“Sam!” Gigi yelled, “Sydney had a reaction...I think we got a contaminated shipment...maybe peanut exposed...she didn't have her pen on her this morning.”

“Oh my...Oh...” I stammered, “Did they get there on time...where did they..?”

“The ambulance got there fast but they took her and I gave them your contact info. I don't know which hospital they were taking her to.”

I lifted the phone from ear and searched the number that called me three times, “They took her St. Luke's.” I stated with a sinking shame and surging terror, “I'm going go there right now and I'll let you know how she's doing.”

This was my worst fear. The thing I thought I was mentally ready to handle not because of muscle memory or training really but because I holding steady searching a tank for a series number in the same frame with burning bodies was the same thing. I could not fathom that last thing we did together was fight and the last thing I sent her was ugly sarcastic wake up call. I drove there with presence. It was a lot of hurry up and wait.

I sat in a glass and metal waiting room. The entire facility reminded me of my sterile university office and it gave me comfort. Still I was waiting, outwardly patiently but inwardly I thought about anaphylaxis – an immune response creating multi-organ multi-system shock resulting in rashes, rapid pulse, vomiting, low blood pressure, swelling of the tongue, airway inflammation and if not treated rapidly with an epi-pen to reverse the immune system cellular destruction and fluid build up it resulted in organ damage and probable death by collapse of the respiratory system. Sydney tried to tell in my my terms at one point: Your entire body violently revolting, violently rioting against, attempting to expel a whisper in the breeze with a 50 megaton thermonuclear bomb and terminating itself in the process. Yet I write it here, like it was in my head then, read like a wikipedia article.

As I sat there, growing in temperature, in sweat, fidgeting in my own reaction, I had a moment of reflection of how different Sydney and I really were. Her body literally demanded a puritanical Pyrrhic purity at literally the first sign of a stressing agent. I fixated myself into a kind of stasis, hibernation but I was collecting something on me all the time, weighing down my mind slowly, killing me softly with every night I didn't sleep and every time that kept me from eating, from enjoying the breath in my lungs that I took for granted while she couldn't rely on it.

I didn't know what it all meant but when it crossed my mind that maybe it wouldn't even matter now something deep inside spurred me out of my seat and back to the nurses' counter to asked about Sydney.

I had been there four hours and I barely registered it. I had to wait another before I was informed her condition was upgraded to moderate but would need overnight observation. I was told she was lucky. She could receive visitors.

She was tethered to a few IV lines and sensors. Her face looked a little red and blotchy, her left eye could not open fully but otherwise she seemed okay. I had reverberations of my last visit with June as I walked in. All this talk of beds...this was the last one I'd want to sleep in. I struggled to lean into a gentle hug as she strained to connect.

“I'm so glad you're okay. I heard you were lucky.”

“Better lucky than good.” She wheezed back, “I saw your text about Brownie. Did you bring him?”

“Oh...no...it hadn't occurred to me.”

“It's okay.” Sydney squirmed, “I was wondering if you could go back and get him for me before they stop taking visitors for the night.”

“Of course, anything.” I pulled a chair from the side close to the bed.

“Thank you...I have something else I'd like you to do.”

“Sure, I'm guessing you'd like to call Gigi and let her know you're okay and need a few days off...”

“You've got to do the sage smudging in that place.”

I flopped back in the chair and tapped the legs with all of the fingers three or four times while exhaling, “Okay...” We've been through this before. I told her before I didn't believe in this stuff in particular and that if she wanted to do it, that's fine but...”

“The weird stuff going on in the apartment and my weird dreams. It's all because we are holding on to a piece of lost family and its manifesting itself there. It came to me as lay dying there. Please you have to do this for me before I come back.”

I threw my head back in the chair and exhaled loudly. At least it was better than her trying to get me to leave my decent job again, the ghosts either in the form of the winter's effects on the building or the delirium in her head from nearly being asphyxiated would pass. Now was not the time to make some kind of philosophical stand. “Okay.” I said, “Can do that.”

“You will that.”

“Yes. I will do that.”

I looked away, “hey, I'm glad you're here.” Sydney said.

“I'm glad you're here.”

“You're not going to do it, are you?”

“Um. Honestly, no.”

“Fine, I'll do it when I get out of here.”

“That's fine.”

“Everything is fine with you. Is there every anything right, with you, lately?”

“Sounds like that bothers you more than it bothers me and I don't get that.”

“Yeah that makes me sound like you, doesn't it?”

“You almost died, why are we fighting here?”

“Because I know what its like to fight for my life and I feel like I'm fighting for both of ours sometimes.”

“I could say the same thing?”

“Oh?”

“I made you that pouch that clips on to your jeans and disguises your epi-pen. Why don't you ever keep it on you like you're supposed to?”

She lifted her one free arm and slapped it down on the bed, “I don't know.”

“Well, its never a bad time to start a good habit.” I said, staring at her, “I'm going to go get Brownie. You want anything else?”

“A beer.”

“Heh. See you soon.”

I was tired from everything when I finally got back to the condo. The elevator was broken again so I was double tired by the time I pulled myself up the final step and leaned against my door for a second to rest. The moment I touched the door I felt an unease. I felt a little nauseous and weaker than I had been even a moment ago. I turned key and the knob and pushed in thinking all I needed some coffee and then to grab that stuffed animal and then I could get back here and sleep.

I stepped through the door and the air thick, hot, humid, tinged in ammonia again. I resigned myself to calling the landlord tomorrow to get someone out here to figure this out. I cracked the window again and started to make another cup of coffee for myself. I had some work emails backed up but I just shut my laptop.

There was a loud sucking sound that at first thought was coming from the coffee machine but it was coming from down the hall again. I sighed and wondered for a second if I should just do the sage thing myself at this point so I could move on to the part where I needed a decent plumber.

I pushed the door to the bedroom open and in the shadow of the hallway light and the darkness of the room I thought I saw it. The bed was a lump. A human shaped outline of a lump under the strewn covers. It was subtle like someone took a gingerbread man cookie cutter on the dough but didn't pop it out yet. I turned the lights on and it was gone. I blinked a few times. I hesitated but slowly touched the bed and pushed down on it a few times

Admittedly this one had my heart rate jump a bit. I shook my head realizing maybe it was a delayed command from earlier, But I stood guarded, my eyes locked on the bed, as I slunk around the far side to grab Brownie off of the window sill. There was some dirty condensation under the bear that I thought was weird but helped to underscore I needed to plastic wrap this window next.

My heart jumped again as the coffee machine gurgled in the kitchen. I shutoff the coffee pot and left. When I got back to the hospital I just missed the end of visiting hours for that wing so I asked the nurse to drop it off to Sydney. She texted me she got it and a kissy face emoji. I replied likewise and couldn't wait to try to sleep.

I woke up feeling refreshed. Intense dreams flicked in and out of my memory as the gray night brightened to a gray morning. I had this dream of little worms crawling up and around my face, through my nose, ears and mouth into my brain. One by one they went black, swelled with ooze and then carried it away into the soil. The soil turned dry and ashen that crumbled into four pieces and fled into the corners of vision, into nothing and then I dropped into oblivion.

Something exploded somewhere but that's okay. It was Saturday and I picked up Sydney from the hospital. She had a new epi-pen on her even though she had a bunch between the carrier I gave her and ones at her apartment and probably the one at mine. She had a poise and purpose to her even if she looked run down and still had a few pink blotches about her. I took her to her old place where she showered and changed clothes. Then she started to rummage through her disorganized closet for something.

“I'm gonna do this for you.” She insisted while unpacking a bundle of sage from a tie-dyed box in her apartment and then made a show of clipping on her epi-pen holster to me. “Mmmm. How stylish, C'mon let's go to your place.”

She sparked up my gas stove and ignited one end of the sage like a cigar and then blew out the weak flame before tracing the perimeter of the entire apartment and then tracing what she said was the names of the deceased in the air – June and Ralph.

“I know that I get a lot of feelings, sometimes,” she began, “but lately my dreams have been terrible, everything has been terrible and then almost dying its like, I saw something that needed to be sent away, thank you goodbye.”

I swallowed hard, “Well, thank you.”

“No, thank you,” She said amorously as she reached up to have her lips meet mine. “You know, there's one more thing we need to test out on that bed before we decide to keep it...” She whispered in my ticklish ear.

“Are you sure you're good to...”

“Yeah, come with me.”

I million thoughts and none thoughts fluttered through me and for some reason it struck me that I had not showered a few days and she just did, I kissed her, our tongues danced together like butterflies in a summer breeze. “Let me clean up a minute.”

She squeezed me, “Don't take too long.” She said taking off her sweater and under shirt revealing a red bra and her fit form before heading down to the hall to the bedroom.

I showered off in a mad dash, still dripping, I threw a towel across my waist so there was something to for her take off as well. I also most slipped on the wood boards of the hall as I pushed open the bedroom door.

In the light of the room I couldn't tell exactly what I was I seeing at first. I was just seeing Sydney's legs kicking violently in the air on the bed but her torso, neck and face were somehow fused in a vortex of blankets, sunken into the mattress. The entire mattress started to ungulate on its frame releasing violent hisses and gulps and gurgles as it banged the steel pivots and parts against the floor and each other. She kicked and twisted as I stood in horror unsure what to do as suddenly she was able to twist herself up and her face appear out of the dark bile colored yellow and ashen blue of the mattress. She took a huge gasp of breath and barely ecked out, “help me!” as it swallowed her again up to her legs.

The mattress swelled outside of its frame taking up more of the room, expanding in all directions except for mine. The mattress compressed and expanded and hissed and growled as it tried to totally swallow her up down to her toes. She punched one arm through that flailed in the air.

I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! Shoot through my head as she threw herself to the side as it had most of her now and she had been struggling for however long...maybe since I stepped int o the shower. She reached for her epi-pen on her side. The pouch fell off of her and to to the bed which bounced it off and it rolled to my feet.

I had an unorthodox hunch. I pried the cap up and exposed the point with the automatic plunger and in a back and forth in mind I jabbed. I jabbed the mattress with the pen. I felt the rattle of the internal spring vibrate through my hand knowing the device triggered successfully, injecting the mattress with adrenaline.

The mattress stretched wide, thin, and translucent, riddled with holes, knocking me down. My ears popped as it violently exploded all the air it had soaked up. I saw Sydney fall out of its grip, banging her elbow against the bed frame to the carpet, where she lay flat but visibly in pain. The mattress snapped back to a square with a vague humanoid outline, about a quarter of its original king size. Then it bound through the air like a rubber band snapped at its breaking point, it bounced off of the wall with a thud and then ping ponged through the hall as I pursued it. It shrunk again and shot itself through the tiny crack in the kitchen window, through which I watched it make one last bounce on the sands of the beach before plunging into the cloudy ocean, vanishing out of sight.

Little bits of liquid pooled up in its trail in the hall, in the kitchen, in the bedroom, they pooled up and turned into little streamers of gelatinous black sludge that smelled terrible and then seemed to boil away on their own, leaving only a fine bit of black, coffee grounds-like grains.

Sydney was mostly dressed clutching her elbow at the end of my hallway near the door. She was gasping and looked terrible all she could say was, “later.” and then walked out, slamming the door. I was too speechless and stunned to say anything back or chase after her.

That was a week ago. I tried texting, I tried calling, I tried knocking on her door, I tried flowers. I didn't hear anything from her and then she blocked me entirely. I considered seeing her at the bakery but I turned against that idea in the short term, hopefully, she could end the shock of what happened and we'd talk.

Outside of the jeopardy of our relationship was certainly in there was the other matter the 90 day trial of the mattress I no longer had possession of would be up soon and then I'd be paying for nothing...for something that I couldn't say had tried to eat my girlfriend and then jumped into the ocean. I searched the website for a way to break the contract and eventually I follow down a path to return a mattress and cancel my automatic payment as an unsatisfied customer. To my dismay, when I reached the bottom of how to reclaim the mattress, there were three options “Pick up at my current address on file” “Pick up at a new address” and “Other”.

I picked “Other”, my computer froze as a new screen on a five second timer appeared, “We understand that our product is not intended for everyone. Your invoice will be shredded and your card on file will be deleted. Better luck with a different product.” The U-Sea logo was watermarked across the page.

I couldn't get a screenshot and I was too baffled to get a shot of the screen with my phone – like it would proven anything if I did anyway.

Well, one problem was solved. Later that day I got a call from her bakery friend, Gigi, explaining she would send me a letter when she ready but that it was over between us and that I had to accept that. She concluded by saying she would come help me box up her stuff from my place.

So I'm slowly typing this up on my coach in the middle of another sleepless night. I guess I'll paraphrase her letter to you: “When I laid down into that bed the first time I saw nightmares and then that day we came back from the hospital I laid down on that bed and saw your spirit or maybe you'd prefer your brain, your mind, I'm now sure its the part of your mind where your job pools and rots and turns you into spiritual landfill, poisoning you from the inside out even as wear a mask to hide it, pretending like it also doesn't affect others. I can't make you quit for me. I tried that. I need you to quit for you but I don't think you will and I can't let myself be wrung out on and just there for whenever you feel like you can be there for us. I love you but I need you to love you too. Goodbye.”

I thought about it. I accepted Sydney isn't coming back. But that bed, from where it was taken from the unknown depths of the ocean was some kind of organism, a live sponge, if I were to take a guess. A sponge that could soak up the mental crap building up in a person and if it got too inundated wring it out on someone else or physically manifest it away. Maybe for the sake of this review, I shouldn't be telling this part but what the hell, I see you and now you see me. I got on the Rest EZ website, put in a different credit card and had a new bed shipped to a vacant unit in my complex on another 90 day free trial.

Honestly, I hadn't slept that care free in years. 5 out of 5

I wasn’t like this before my medication but with my antipsychotic I think it does not mix well. Do you have the same thing? Or could it be something unrelated?

1ptffdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1ptffdc/3_day_power_outage_prepping_saved_the_day/,3 day power outage; prepping saved the day.,"Last week, our power was shut off for three days because of high winds and fire danger.

My neighbors joked with us for years for being peppers.  No one is making jokes anymore.  And many have now come to me to help them start to become more prepared.

Years ago, we installed a massive solar system, with extensive battery backups.  We also installed a natural gas generator that charges the batteries if they get too low.  We never had any power issues, even when the clouds came in and lower solar production.

We ended up storing breast milk for nursing mothers.  We had neighbors bring over deep freezers to plug into our garage.  We ran extension cords to our immediate neighbors houses.  Neighbors came over to charge phones and tablets.  We were even able to make warm coffee for the neighbors each morning.   

We also switched internet to Starlink.  If you have power, it works (land based internet does not).  So we never lost internet either.

While power was out, we didn’t even notice it.  The house was warm.  The fridge was cold.  We cooked and lived as if nothing changed.  

The best part of all of this was that many of our neighbors are starting to adopt the prepper mindset.  ",47,1766448935.0,preppers,4,0.96,False

1ptfden,https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1ptfden/sticky_stools_no_weight_loss_or_pain/,"Sticky stools, no weight loss or pain","I'm posting about this to see if anyone has had similar experiences or has knowledge about the issue. Almost all of the articles I see about sticky stools focus on fat malabsorption, which I don't think I have.

I've had incredly sticky stools for the past four years. Nothing else about my bowel movements have changed though. I go consistently, usually the same time each day, and have not lost weight. 

Every article I read mentions to eat more fiber. I already eat a lot: beans, whole grain bread, etc. There was a period I was getting cramps after lunch, so I cut down on high-fiber foods and felt better. I thought at first too much fiber was causing sticky stools, but they've remained. 

I drink coffee every day. I stopped drinking it for a month or two but nothing changed. I don't eat fried foods or red meat often. I eat fat-free yogurt. 

I told my doctor about it and she said it was nothing to worry about since I wasn't losing weight. She said some people just have sticky stools. But I never had this probably until suddenly a few years ago.

I took probiotics for awhile but those did nothing. I take one serving of psyllium husk each morning which helps a lot. If I miss one day though, I'm right back to sticky stools. I get a lot of soluble fiber from other sources too, but psyllium husk is the only thing that helps. 

I don't have any pain. I exercise regularly. I drink a lot of water.

Any ideas what the issue is? Should I get an opinion from a different doctor?​",1,1766448783.0,GutHealth,1,1.0,False
1ptfcq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ptfcq8/update_to_crazy_email_from_mil/,Update to crazy email from MIL,"Please see my previous post where I posted a nutty email from my MIL to DH. I decided to break NC and unblock her just to write this. I have now reblocked her. I just couldn’t let her have the last word (it’s not my style: 

“Dearest \[MIL\], I saw that email and I am so sorry you feel that way. My deepest desire was to be close with you and I tried so hard for years, including only a couple of weeks ago when I hoped we could all come together to support \[DH\] in \[X\]. I was so sad you didn’t come (as was \[DH\]) but ready to see you in the new year! 

Obviously seeing you say I’m “wicked”,  “bad genes”, “narcissistic”, “disturbed” are truly awful things. I would never speak about you or \*anyone\* with such disrespect. That is not my personality. But it is clear just how much you despise me and there is no chance for a relationship. So we can all now move on. 

As for saying the “bad genes” comment  and “what hope is there for your children” that truly scares me as I always hoped you would be a wonderful grandmother to our future children. But you seem to have your views shaped already on that and no future children of ours will be exposed to such cruel views. 

I wish you the most wonderful Christmas with your family and I hope that this closure brings you the peace it has finally brought me. All the best. Xxx”

DH also sent an email addressing each of her points and saying it was insane that she wanted to meet me for a “nice coffee” whilst saying I’m disturbed/have bad genes etc. He ended saying he needs time and space to reflect on whether a relationship is possible.  

It really was such an own goal from MIL  because I was feeling pressure from DH before this to break NC and had she sent a genuinely nice email I would have been in a difficult position. Instead MIL has just united us more. 

We are now off on a holiday with my family to Thailand so the only family she has destroyed is her own. So in a way this is a success. She has shown her true colours and I can have some peace!!",109,1766448733.0,JUSTNOMIL,15,0.95,False

After updating all firmware on the console and the controllers, these things are still absolute garbage. Not “a little flaky.” Not “sometimes annoying.” Flat out unusable.

If you prop your leg up.

If you lean back.

If a coffee table exists between you and the console.

If you are more than a few feet away.

If you have music playing loudly

Congrats, you just lost connection. You have input lag, you have buttons that keep doing the same thing. This is crazy.

This is not an edge case. This is not interference from a microwave in the next room. This is basic, everyday living room usage. The controller disconnects if reality dares to exist between it and the console. I have owned cheap no name Bluetooth controllers from a decade ago that outperform this thing without breaking a sweat.

And before someone asks, yes, everything is updated. Console firmware. Controller firmware. Multiple controllers. Multiple environments. Same result every time. Which is why it is hilarious that there are post after post after post on this subreddit describing the exact same problem. Same symptoms. Same frustration. Same disbelief that this shipped.

What makes this so impressive in the worst possible way is that both Analogue and 8BitDo have proven they know how to make good products. Analogue built its entire reputation on obsessive accuracy and premium execution. 8BitDo has been pumping out solid controllers for years. Somehow, when these two companies combined forces, the result was a Bluetooth controller that behaves like it was designed during a lunch break and never tested outside of a sterile lab with no furniture, no walls, and no humans.

What really kills me is that this feels less like a technical limitation and more like pure indifference. As if at some point someone said, “Yeah it kind of works, ship it.” That mentality is insane for a company that sells itself on perfection and nostalgia done right. Wireless controllers are not new. Bluetooth is not new. This problem was solved years ago by companies charging half the price.

The end result is that the Analogue 3D is sitting there, capable of being something great, while the official controller experience makes you feel like you are beta testing a product that should never have left the building. When users are tripping over identical complaints across multiple threads, that is not user error. That is a design failure.

Genuinely, congratulations to Analogue and 8BitDo. It takes real effort, real money, and real confidence to release a controller this bad in an era where competent wireless tech is everywhere. You did not just miss the mark. You redefined how low it could be set.",11,1766448489.0,AnalogueInc,43,0.59,False

There's a Witch in the garage  


Part 2 

""I don't know how you can sleep in this house, man,"" Alex said, his voice hushed like he didn’t want it to carry too far. We were sitting in my room, it was a Saturday afternoon. 

""What am I supposed to do?"" I shot back, a little sharper than I intended.

He shook his head, grimacing. ""I’d rather be homeless, dude. Seriously. I’d take my chances with a cardboard box and alley cats before sleeping under this roof again.""

I had just told Alex everything. The dream, the shadow in the garage, the deadbolt clicking in the middle of the night, and the way my dad drifted through the dark like he wasn’t quite real.

""You’ve been in the garage though, right?"" he asked, squinting at me like he was searching for some kind of lie I hadn’t confessed yet.

""Of course I have. I’ve been in there a million times. It’s just a normal garage.""

Even as the words left my mouth, they felt sour and thin. That wasn’t the whole truth. Not even close. I knew it, maybe Alex did too. 

Yes, I had been in the garage—but only ever through the overhead doors or the rear entrance, the one that looks out into the backyard. Never, not once in my nearly fifteen years of life, had I stepped through the red door that connected the garage to the house. Not from the kitchen. Not from the hall. Not from anywhere inside. That door might as well have been bricked over in my mind.

And I had known this was strange for a long time. I had known.

But saying it out loud, or even really admitting it to myself felt like pulling a trigger on something that couldn’t be undone. Because if I accepted that, then I had to accept something far worse: that my father wasn’t who he said he was.

And I don’t know which truth is harder to live with.

Either there’s a witch in the garage. Or there’s a monster in the house.

""Did you ever try to do what Danny did?"" Alex asked, his voice low, almost like he didn’t want the question to echo in the room.

""What do you mean?"" I replied, even though I had a feeling I already knew.

""Well, Danny stood by the garage door, right? And the witch spoke to him. Have you ever tried that?""

I had. More than once, in fact. Over the years, I’d lingered around the garage, sometimes standing still for long stretches of time, sometimes pacing back and forth just outside the red door, hoping and dreading that I might hear something. But either nothing happened or my dad always seemed to appear, needing my help with something. A chore. A question. A distraction.

I was explaining all this to Alex when we both froze at the soft knock on my bedroom door.

My dad’s head poked around the frame a second later.

""Hey guys,"" he said with his usual relaxed smile. ""We’re heading to the dump to drop off some old stuff. Found a box of your things from when you were little. Mind going through it and pulling anything you want to keep?""

He placed the box in my hands without waiting for an answer, then turned and walked away.

""Sure,"" I said flatly to the empty hallway.

We sat cross-legged on the floor as I peeled open the flaps of the old cardboard box. A puff of dust lifted into the air, catching the light like ash. Inside were old plastic toys with missing arms, a faded baseball cap, and a small trophy that read “3rd Place - Karate.”

""When did you do karate?"" Alex asked with a smirk, clearly holding back laughter.

""Don’t mess with me, man. I’ll sweep your legs,"" I said, making a ridiculous chopping motion in the air.

We both laughed and kept digging. The box was a time capsule of forgotten odds and ends. Stickers, marbles, bits of colored string, a yo-yo that no longer lit up. At the very bottom were a stack of drawings, folded and crumpled, their paper soft with age. Most were harmless, dogs, fish, some scribbles that might’ve been superheroes or dinosaurs. We joked about my artistic skills, flipping through them one by one.

Then Alex went quiet.

He held a drawing in his hand, staring at it for too long. The amusement drained from his face.

""You have a sister?"" he asked, his tone suddenly cautious.

""No,"" I said, hesitating. ""Why?""

He turned the drawing toward me.

It was a simple picture, the kind any little kid would draw. A house made of a square and a triangle, smoke curling from a cartoon chimney, the sun in the corner, a patch of green grass. In front of the house stood four stick figures. One small, probably meant to be me. One tall, broad-shouldered figure, definitely my dad. One with a dress and long brown lines for hair, my mom. And then... another woman. Same size as my mom. Same long hair. Standing just a few steps apart, like she belonged there.

Alex pointed at them, slowly. ""Kid. Dad. Mom... Mom?""

My stomach turned. I could hear the soft creak of my father’s footsteps coming down the hallway.

Without a word, I grabbed the drawing and slid it under the bed.

Dad stepped into the room just as I finished. ""Find anything you want to keep?"" he asked, eyes flicking between us.

""No,"" I said quickly, loading everything back into the box.

He nodded, cheerful as ever. ""Alright then. We’ll be back in an hour or so.""

""Okay."" I didn’t look at him.

Something in the air shifted. His smile dipped for half a second, just a flicker but I saw it. He was reading the room.

""Be good,"" he said, and then he was gone.

We listened as the front door opened and shut, the car doors slammed, and the engine disappeared down the street.

""Was that a drawing of the witch?"" Alex finally said, his voice rising with disbelief.

""It was just a drawing,"" I said too quickly, searching for any kind of reasonable explanation but nothing came. My mind was blank.

""A drawing of a son, a dad, a mom, and... another mom,"" Alex said again, slower this time.

We stared at each other, the room suddenly too quiet. The air felt heavier.

Under the bed, the paper lay dormant.

I reached under and lifted the paper. 

I started to speak slowly “Kid, Dad, Mom”

“Witch” Alex cut me off. 

Alex doesn’t sleep over anymore. Not that night. Not since.

He says it’s because of school, or his parents, or just needing a break, but I know better. I think we both do. The house feels different now. There’s something heavy in the air, something unspoken, a secret hideousness. My mom and dad still move through our days like everything’s fine. We eat dinner together. We laugh. We talk about nothing. But it all feels rehearsed, like lines read from a script in a play no one wants to watch.

A performance, not a life.

And my dad, he knows something. I can feel it in the way he looks at me sometimes, like he’s checking to see if I know too. And I do. I don’t know what, not exactly, but I know enough to know that nothing is what it seems. And I think he knows that I know.

Last night, I had another dream.

No, not a dream. A memory wearing a dream’s skin.

I was crying. Alone. At the bottom of something. A pit maybe, a hole carved deep into the earth. I was sitting on a slick, rotting heap of garbage. Wet cardboard, plastic, food wrappers bloated with decay. The air stank of mildew and something far worse, like meat left out too long.

It was cold. My skin ached. My body throbbed with a dull, steady pain that pulsed like a heartbeat. The darkness was thick, almost physical. But then. Click. A light above snapped on.

A spotlight.

A single circle of harsh white light opened far above me. I looked up and saw bricks curving around me like the inside of a well, rising twenty feet or more. I was in a tunnel or a shaft, some place meant to hold things. Or trap them.

I heard footsteps above me. Muffled. Slow. Methodical. They echoed strangely, as though they were underwater. I realized I could no longer hear my own crying. My mouth was open, my face soaked in tears, but there was no sound. Like the world had turned down the volume.

Then the light dimmed slightly, something was standing over the opening.

A silhouette. A head. Someone was looking down at me.

I didn’t move. Couldn’t. My breath caught in my throat as the figure lifted a hand and gave a gentle wave. Familiar. Too familiar.

In the other hand, they held a brown paper bag. They let it drop.

It struck my shoulder before sliding to the floor. I opened it with shaking hands.

Two slices of pizza.

Cold, greasy, and smeared against the inside of the bag—but I devoured them without thinking. My hunger roared to the surface like a beast. I had been starving. Starving for longer than I could understand.

The figure stood above me, still and silent. Then they stepped away.

Their shadow receded from the light, and the footsteps returned, fading like a lullaby played backward.

Click.

The light went out.

Nothing but darkness. Absolute. I couldn’t see my hands. Couldn’t feel the floor beneath me. Just the cold. The wet. The black.

And somewhere in that black, I kept crying, soundless, voiceless, waiting for the next bag to fall.

I awoke the way I always do now. Soaked in sweat, heart pounding so violently I could feel it in my throat. 

I turned my head toward the alarm clock. That familiar red light burned through the darkness, too sharp to look at directly, bleeding into the walls and ceiling like a warning.

3:04 a.m.

I found myself wondering if my dad was awake.

What a strange, grim thought.

Who wants to be awake at this hour? What is there to do in the dead middle of the night but wait for something to go wrong?

Still, I got up. Wide awake. My stomach clawed at me with a hollow ache, like the hunger from my dream had followed me across the threshold of sleep and into this world.

I turned on the light. No need for stealth, I wasn’t sneaking around. I was just hungry. That was all.

I made my way to the kitchen, passing the dining table without thinking. The fridge greeted me with a dull hum. Cold air spilled over my bare feet as I opened it.

We had pizza yesterday.

Pizza is my favorite. It’s what I ask for every time my parents let me choose dinner. A little ritual of comfort. Predictable.

But the box was empty.

Completely, insultingly empty.

I sighed. Mom hates when we do that. Leave containers behind with nothing inside. She acts like it’s a betrayal of the home itself, some grave violation. I found it quite funny actually. Along with the empty pizza box in the fridge there was also a bag of Salt was left out on the counter. Mom would be so pissed.  

I figured Dad must’ve eaten the last of it. I shut the door and pivoted to Plan B. Ramen noodles. 

“What are you doing up?”

My father’s voice, casual, calm.

My body reacted before my brain did. I physically jumped, feet leaving the ground. A shock of pure fear surged through me like a live wire.

He was sitting at the dining table.

In the dark.

He’d been there the whole time. Watched me walk by. Watched me open the fridge. Watched me searching, unaware of the eyes fixed on my back.

“Jesus Christ, Dad,” I gasped, clutching at my chest.

He didn’t smile. Didn’t laugh. Just sat there, watching me. His face empty, unreadable.

Then, slowly, like remembering how to perform, a grin spread across his mouth.

“Sorry, son,” he said gently. “Didn’t mean to scare you.”

I nodded, swallowing down the last of my panic, trying to find the edges of composure.

“I was just... hungry,” I said. “Wanted some pizza.”

“That’s gone,” he replied.

There was something strange about how he said it. Not annoyed. Not apologetic. Just final.

“Did you eat it?” I asked.

“I just told you,” he said, smile unwavering. “It’s gone. Who else would’ve eaten it?”

I wanted to say nothing. I wanted to let it drop.

“The witch in the garage,” I said flatly.

He didn’t move.

Five, maybe ten seconds passed. Then he laughed. A weak, fake laugh like someone trying to mimic the sound without really feeling it.

“Yeah,” he said. “Maybe.”

He stood up, slowly. He looked at the table for a long moment, then lifted his gaze to meet mine. His eyes were glassy, unreadable.

“Sam,” he began, voice low. “There’s a lot of darkness in this world.”

The words hit me like a crack of thunder, sudden, loud, impossible to ignore.

It was the first time I had ever heard my father speak without his usual mask. There was no warmth in his tone. Just truth.

“There are things out there,” he continued, “that are hard to explain. Things that don’t make sense. Things I hope you never have to understand.”

He paused.

“But maybe one day you will have to.”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. I was rooted in place. Frozen.

“What are you trying to say?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He looked down, muttered something I didn’t catch. Then he spoke clearly again.

“Everything I do,” he said, “I do for you and your mother.”

I didn’t know how to respond.

“Okay,” I murmured. What else was there to say?

“I love you, Sam,” he said.

“I love you too, Dad,” I replied, throat tight.

He smirked, not smiled, smirked. A quick exhale coming from his nose. 

“Dad,” I said slowly, cautiously, “if I ask you something... do you promise to tell me the truth?”

He looked at me. Really looked. Then raised both hands and rubbed his face, slowly, like wiping something invisible from his skin.

“Yes, Sam,” he said, and this time his voice was grave. “You can ask me a question.”

He emphasized the word ‘A’ as if to make it clear I only got one.

Just one.

My body began to tremble. I didn’t know why. I was only a boy, standing in front of his father. A scene that should have been safe. Familiar.

But something was wrong.

“Is the witch real?” I asked, keeping my voice steady.

“Yes, Sam,” he said. “The witch is real.”

Then he turned and walked back toward his bedroom. No explanation. No fear.

Just silence.

There were so many questions I could have asked him.  
 Do we have a basement?  
 Was there ever someone else in our family?  
 Is the witch in a well?

But I panicked. My chest was tight, my thoughts were spiraling, and I asked the first thing that came to mind.

“He said it was real?” Alex repeated, barely above a whisper.

We sat together at lunch, shoulders hunched forward, our voices low. The world around us was loud, kids yelling, laughing, the clatter of trays, but it all felt distant. Sounded like we were underwater again.

“Yeah,” I muttered.

He looked at me, eyes wide. “Your dad said that? Just like that?”

I nodded, not offering more.

Alex stared down at his untouched sandwich. “Anything else happen?”

“Not really,” I said. “Just more nightmares.”

I didn’t want to talk about it anymore. Every time I brought it up, every time I said the word witch or garage or red door, I felt like something drained out of me. I wasn’t even afraid anymore, just tired. Worn out from the weight of secrets I didn’t understand.

Danny walked past us in the cafeteria, surrounded by his usual group. He caught my eye and gave a friendly nod. He looked normal. Happy. But I knew he wasn’t. How could he be? I've never seen the witch, never heard her, and she spoke to him. 

Later, Alex invited me to spend the weekend at his place. Play video games. Watch dumb movies. Fall asleep at 4am like we used to. I told him I wasn’t up for it. I just wanted to sleep.

That was a lie.

When I got home, I sat in my room, staring at the picture. The one from the box. The drawing with the square house, the triangle roof, and four figures standing out front.

“A kid. A dad. A mom. And... a mom.” I said aloud.

My voice sounded small in the quiet room.

I could hear my real mom in the kitchen, pans clinking, the faint hiss of something frying in oil. She was humming softly to herself.

I walked out and stood in the kitchen doorway. She looked over, smiling. “Hey sweetheart. Everything okay?”

I hesitated, then handed her the picture. “I found this in that old box Dad gave me.”

She took it, holding it gently between her fingers like it might crumble. “Aw, Sam... This is adorable. I forgot how much you used to draw. You were so creative.”

I stared at her. “Mom. Why are there two women in the drawing?”

She blinked. “Two?”

I pointed. “There. That one’s you. That one’s Dad. That’s me. who’s *she*?”

Her face didn’t change. No flash of fear, no confusion. Just a calm, almost practiced smile.

“Oh, I don’t know, honey. You had such a wild imagination as a kid. Maybe you wanted a sister, or maybe she was a friend. You used to make up stories all the time, remember?”

I didn’t respond.

“She looks exactly like you,” I said. My voice was flat.

Mom chuckled softly. “Well, they’re stick figures, Sam. How different could she look?”

She had a point. But it didn’t feel right.

“Is everything okay?” she asked again, tilting her head. Her voice was so gentle, so sincere. And for a moment, I felt safe. For the first time in weeks.

But maybe that was the plan.

My mind started racing. I saw flashes of memory. A dark hallway. The sound of a latch. A smell like wet brick and iron. Things I had ignored for years. Weird noises. Locked doors. The red door.

There was a truth hiding behind the drywall of this house. It had been growing in the walls like mold since I was a child.

“Have you ever gone through the red door, Mom?” I asked.

She looked up from the picture and laughed, confused. “The red door? In the garage?”

“Yes.”

“Of course, Sam. We were in there last week, remember? We moved those boxes together.” She gave me a puzzled look and shook her head.

“That’s not what I asked.”

She paused. Her smile faltered, just a little.

“I asked,” I said again, “if you’ve ever *gone* through the red door.”

“Sam, the red door leads to the garage,” she said, her voice suddenly firm.

“Does it?” I took a step forward. My voice was shaking now. “So we don’t have a basement? That door just goes to the garage and nowhere *else*?”

“Of course not,” she said quickly. Too quickly.

“Then why are there *locks* on both sides of it?” I snapped. “Why does it lock from the inside and the outside, Mom?”

She stared at me. Her eyes began to shimmer. A tear rolled down her cheek.

“Sam...” she whispered. “Please, stop. You’re scaring me.”

“No,” I said. “*Dad* is the one who’s scaring me. I know he’s hiding something. I know you are too.”

She stepped forward and reached out. “Sweetheart, you’re not well. Maybe it’s just the nightmares, or stress, or”

“I’m not crazy,” I hissed. “You’re just good at pretending.”

“Sam, please,” she said, her voice trembling. “You need help. You’re saying things that aren’t real.”

I backed away from her, from the kitchen, from her soft eyes that looked more like lies than comfort now.

She stood there holding the drawing in her hand. The one with the fourth figure. The one she didn’t name.

The woman in the picture was still smiling.  
 And I didn’t know who she was.  
 But she looked a lot like my mother.

After the fight, I went back to my room and shut the door behind me. The air felt heavier now. Still. Like the house was holding its breath. I sat on the edge of my bed, elbows on my knees, just waiting for the sound of the front door opening, for his footsteps, for something.

Dad always got home around 5:30. Like clockwork.

But 5:30 came and went.

Then 6:00.

Then 6:45.

The sun had vanished by then, and the blue twilight outside was starting to curdle into full night. I checked the time again. 7:00. Nothing.

At 7:10 p.m., the phone rang.

It was a sharp, old-fashioned sound. Like something out of a dream, or a nightmare.

I heard my mom pick it up in the hallway. A few seconds of silence. Then a small, fractured whimper slipped out of her mouth. My skin stood up. 

“Wait, what? No, no, no, what happened?” she stammered.

That was enough. My anger toward her evaporated. She might’ve been hiding something, but she was still my mother, and right now, she sounded like a frightened child. I stepped out into the hallway just as she was pulling on her coat with frantic, jerky movements.

“Mom?” I asked, my voice thin. “What’s going on?”

She turned to me, eyes red, phone still clutched in her hand.

“There’s been an accident,” she said. Her voice cracked on the last word.

There were tears already, but I didn’t know if they were from me, or the phone call, or both. The details came during the drive. Barely strung-together thoughts between panicked breaths.

“Your father was in a car crash,” she said. “They said a truck. Some truck hit him. A bad one. He’s at the hospital.”

I said nothing. Just watched the blur of passing headlights and shadows out the window. Everything felt slowed down. Muffled. Like I’d been dropped underwater. An unfortunately familiar feeling for me recently. 

When we got to the hospital, I found out what really happened. He’d been sideswiped by a truck, some distracted driver on his phone, apparently. The driver walked away with a broken wrist. But Dad… Dad had taken the full impact. They put him into a medically induced coma “for his own safety,” the doctors said. Their voices were calm. Practiced. Rehearsed for hundreds of nights like this one.

I listened in pieces. It was all just noise—soft voices, sliding doors, papers shuffling. I didn’t cry. I didn’t feel much of anything. If anything, I felt absent. Like I’d slipped a few feet outside of my own body. Watching a movie I didn’t want to see.

We waited. For hours.

Sympathetic looks came from every direction. Nurses smiled with sad eyes. Doctors patted shoulders and used the word Champ. No one said it out loud, but everyone in that waiting room knew what kind of night this was.

My mom barely spoke. She held a balled-up tissue in one hand, trembling, as if it were the only thing tethering her to this reality. I wanted to comfort her. But I didn’t move. I just stared ahead. Thinking about the last conversation I’d had with Dad. The *only* honest one we might have ever had. I had asked him a question. One question. And I got an answer I didn’t understand. Now I felt like I may never speak with him again. 

They let us see him at 11:04 p.m.

I remember the exact time, because I looked at the red digital clock in the hallway and felt a jolt, just like the alarm clock in my room. Red numbers. Always red. 

The room was filled with a quiet symphony of mechanical life support. A soft, pulsing beep. The sound of suction. An oxygen machine that sighed and inhaled, like something alive. Like something waiting.

He was lying there. My dad.

His face was covered in a cascade of bruises and shallow cuts. There were bandages, dried blood at the edges, IVs in both arms. But it was still him. Still *Dad*. Not broken. Just… still.

“Hey,” my mom whispered, stepping toward him like he might wake at the sound.

I stood behind her. Frozen.

The machines beeped, slow and steady, like a metronome counting the seconds of life passing by. 

 felt something shift in my chest. Not sadness exactly. Something colder.

His clothes were folded neatly in a clear plastic bin labeled with a thin white tag. Personal Effects it read. Something about that phrase made my stomach turn. Like he was already gone.

I wasn’t supposed to look. But I did.

Among the blood-speckled shirt and crumpled jeans, I saw something gleam faintly in the harsh hospital lighting, something metallic, half-buried in the folds. My heart jumped.

Keys.

I glanced at Mom. She was standing at the edge of Dad’s bed, wiping her eyes, trying to be brave. Trying to look strong for both of us. But I wasn’t watching her out of sympathy. I was watching her to make sure she didn’t see me.

I reached down casually, slid my hand into the container, and felt around until my finger looped through the keyring. I closed my hand tightly, muffling the soft jingle of metal, and slipped the whole thing into my coat pocket in one smooth motion. Cold steel. Heavy with purpose.

“Hey, Mom,” I said, forcing a tremble into my voice like I was holding back tears.

“Yes, hun?” she replied quickly, looking over her shoulder with a practiced smile. It didn’t touch her eyes.

“Could I, could I get some water or something?” I asked, fumbling for more words, trying to sell it. “Maybe step outside for a minute. Just… some air.”

She nodded without hesitation. “Of course. That’s probably a good idea,” she said, brushing at her cheeks with a tissue. “Go ahead. I’ll be right here.”

I turned and walked out without another word. The second I was in the hallway, I picked up speed, not running, but not walking slow enough to get stopped. My thoughts were loud. Deafening. The keys felt like they were burning a hole in my pocket.

I found the first staff member I could, an older woman behind a counter, peering at a screen and sipping from a hospital-branded coffee cup.

“Hi,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Is Mrs. Pierce working tonight?”

She looked at me, surprised, then nodded and picked up a phone. A few short calls. A few moments of waiting.

Then, around the corner, she appeared.

Alex’s mom.

“Oh, Sam,” she said, walking up with open arms, “I heard what happened. I’m so, so sorry, sweetheart.”

Her hug was warm, but I didn’t feel it. 

She pulled back, keeping her hands gently on my shoulders.

“Your dad’s strong. And this hospital’s one of the best. The doctors here…” she gave me a little smile, trying to lift the moment, “they’re basically wizards, you know?”

“Or witches,” I said, without thinking. The words slid out, dry and bitter.

“Could you give me a ride home?” I asked. 

After telling Mom that Mrs. Pierce would be driving me home, we left. It was a long, silent ride. I didn’t try to talk much, and I couldn’t have told you anything she said if you asked me. I was somewhere else, already halfway down the hallway, staring at the red door in my mind.

I got home around midnight. The house looked the same, but it felt completely different. My own house had never scared me like this. It was too quiet, too dark. But not empty.

Something was still inside. I knew it.

I unlocked the front door. My hand trembled. As I stepped inside, I had this vivid flash, just for a moment of something standing in the garage window, waving.

I didn’t lock the door behind me.

I walked slowly through the quiet house. Past the kitchen. Past the living room. Down the long hallway.

Until I stood before the red door.

That door had been a shadow cast across my entire childhood. A question no one ever answered. A giant red threat dressed up like a little white lie. 

My hand reached up, almost on its own. I slid the deadbolt open. I inserted my father’s key into the lock and turned. It clicked.

I paused. I prayed, silently, foolishly, that I’d open the door and see nothing but a garage. My father’s dusty old pickup. Tools. Paint cans. Normal things.

I opened the door.

Behind it was a narrow space. A short passage. On the other side was another identical red door.

To the right: a thin, crumbling staircase made of old brick, leading down into pitch-black darkness. A single metal chain dangled from the ceiling like a forgotten noose.

I pulled it. Click.

The lights buzzed and flickered to life, revealing the start of something ancient. Something hidden.

Each step I took down the stairs made the air feel heavier, thicker, older. Like I was walking into something that had been sealed away for centuries. At the bottom of the steps was a small stone corridor. Around the corner, I entered a large underground room.

It was damp and cold, and it reeked like rot and mildew and death. The walls were stone, stained dark. The floor was littered with trash: torn food wrappers, pizza boxes, old cans, and bags of salt.

And in the center of the room… was a well.

A stone well, about three feet high, open and roofless, like something torn out of a fairytale, but there was nothing magical about it. It was surrounded by a perfect circle of white salt.

Until I stepped too close and accidentally kicked some of the salt away, breaking the ring.

That’s when I heard it.

“Hello…” came a voice from inside the well.

I stumbled back, gasping.

“Hello?” I answered, my voice shaking.

“Who's there?” the voice asked, hoarse and ragged.

“S-Sam,” I said, barely able to get the word out.

“Will you help me, Sam?”

The voice sounded scared. Tired. Human. Not some cackling hag like I had imagined all my life. It was a woman. A person.

“So you're real,” I said, eyes welling up with terrified tears. “There really is a witch...”

The voice whimpered. “I'm not a witch, Sam.” She was crying now, deep, anguished sobs echoing up from the stone. “I'm a prisoner.”

I couldn’t speak. My hands were shaking violently.

“Your father… he's kept me down here for years. Please. Help me.”

“Who are you?” I finally managed to ask.

“My name is Sarah,” the voice said. “I’m Danny’s mother.”

The room spun. My knees buckled. My breath caught in my throat.

Danny’s mother. The one who’d *disappeared*. The one they said *ran away*. The one Danny never talked about.

“Wait here,” I said, voice cracking. “I’m going to call the police. I’m going to call Danny.”

“No, wait,” she pleaded. “Sometimes… sometimes your father lowers a rope for food or clothes, when he’s feeling merciful. It’s already tied. Please, just drop it down. I've been down here far too long.”

I grabbed the coil of rope from the corner. It was already anchored to the wall, knotted expertly like it had been used many times before.

I tossed it into the well.

“I’ll be right back,” I promised, already running, sprinting up the stairs, through the red door, slamming it shut behind me out of instinct. My hands flew across drawers and cupboards until I found the small phone book my mom still kept.

*Danny - Home.*

I dialed the number. My heart was in my throat. The phone rang.

“Hello?” Danny answered.

“Danny, it’s Sam,” I gasped, tears flooding my face.

“Oh hey, man, what’s up?”

“I found her,” I cried. “Your mom. She didn’t leave. She didn’t run away. She’s here, Danny. She’s been under my house this whole time.”

There was silence on the other end.

Then, finally, Danny laughed, but not a happy laugh. A confused one.

“Sam… my mom’s in rehab.”

“No. No, she’s not. I just talked to her. She said that my dad locked her away. Danny, you said she disappeared”

“She did man. Years ago. She was gone for a while, but she came back. She’s getting better now. I saw her last weekend. We go visit every other Sunday.”

My breath stopped.

The phone slipped from my hand and hit the kitchen floor with a dull crack.

Downstairs… in the dark… a rope was being pulled taut.

And someone…  something was climbing up.

    Emma stands in a small waiting room just outside the homicide office. Through the glass, she can see a large map of the Revere campus broken down into patrol sectors. Inside, she can hear the voice of Detective Murphy and his partner, but from where she stands, it is hard to make out anything they are saying. She approaches the door to knock but decides instead to wait and see what information she can pick up that they might not intend for her to hear.
    “Look kid, let's not get ahead of ourselves here. This isn’t patrol where you run after the bad guy who just stole a lady's purse. It takes time, patience, and lots of work,” Murphy says.
    “Don't you think I know that, Murph? I get it. I'm just saying each day that goes by, the trail gets colder. We should be out there asking questions, interviewing witnesses, and talking to our informants,” Corso says.
    “Right now we have two cases. The captain won't even utter the words serial killer for at least a few more weeks. That shit is bad for business, so let's just slow down and do our jobs without scaring the shit out of half the city. Okay?”
    Emma flinches at the phrase serial killer. She raises her hand and knocks, not realizing the door isn't even fully closed. It swings open awkwardly and suddenly she is standing there.
    Murphy turns his head to look at the young college-aged girl with red hair poking her head into the room. She has a bag in one hand and a drink carrier with three cups of coffee in the other. Before the investigators can even say anything, she starts talking.
    ""It’s me, Emma Sullivan, from the Brown Beauty. Is this Detective Murphy’s office? The guy at the front desk said this was your space.”
    Murphy looks around and raises his arms out slightly to his side in surprise before responding. ""Sorry, it's not you, but I told them not to just let people walk back here. They are supposed to make you wait up front for one of us to come get you. I swear, it's like they think nobody hates the cops.”
    Corso perks up, quickly rises to his feet, brushes his hair back, and with his hand outstretched towards Emma, introduces himself. ""I'm Johnny Corso. How can I help you?""
    Murphy smirks at his partner's exuberance. ""Don't mind him, he acts this way anytime any girl talks to him. Make sure you wash your hand before you touch your face, if you know what I'm saying.”
    Emma pulls her hand away from Corso. “I know you guys are busy. I bought coffee and Dunkin’ hoping I can barter for an interview.""
    Corso, still standing right in front of her, quickly blurts out, “Deal! No take-backs.""
    Murphy rolls his eyes. ""I guess we agree. That coffee got whiskey in it by chance? I'm only half-joking about that.""
    Emma chuckles. “Yeah, I'm sure you are. Anyway, I am hoping to talk to you about the Finn and Lausen murders for the school paper. Everyone on campus is pretty much losing their minds right now. Rumors are swirling and everyone is on edge. The dean has increased security around campus and said campus police will walk students back and forth to class and the dorms after dark.""
    Murphy nodded. “All of those sound like good ideas. I'm terribly sorry though, Ms. Sullivan, both of those are ongoing investigations and we can't reveal certain details to the press without alerting the killer we’re on to them.""
    Emma listened intently. “So you have a suspect?""
    “No, not yet,"" they respond in unison.
    “Any good leads?"" she asks as a follow-up.
    The two men once again speak as one. ""Not really.”
    Emma wrinkles her brow and opens her eyes a little further. “DNA? Whoever it is has to have... left something behind at the crime scene at least once. I mean, isn't that pretty standard?""
    Murphy responds, very excited by her intuition. ""That's the exact same thing I just said... but no.""
    Corso interjects with a sarcastic tone. “Maybe he is a monk.""
    Emma prods them again. ""So what do you have?""
    “Pussy blood,"" Murphy unapologetically responds. ""A metric fuck-ton of it.""
    Emma gasps like she was slapped in the face by the words themselves. Even knowing the colorful language police often use, she was still a bit shocked. ""Pussy blood? I'm not sure what you're saying, Detective.""
    Corso chimes in somewhat mockingly. ""Murphy here thinks there was menstrual blood found at both crime scenes... he says he can smell it.”
    “I can, dammit,"" Murphy shoots back. ""I can smell clam leakage anywhere... like a bear or a shark!”
    Emma thinks back to when she first met Murphy when she was just in grade school. He was just an officer back then, still wild-eyed and optimistic, long before his days were spent investigating murders. She knows he doesn't mean to be crude; it's what twenty-three years as a cop does to someone. In homicide, those years are like dog years. Still, she feels she needs to ask. ""Like from a woman? You think the killer is a woman?""
    Corso chimes in. ""Well, based on the fury that was unleashed, it isn't the worst theory we have heard. Maybe the killer is just a hangry woman. What do you think, Murph?”
    Murphy shoots a sideways glance at his partner, then back at Emma. ""Is there anything else that bleeds so damn much? Of course the blood is from a woman. Look, I'm sorry... we're just stressed. To be clear, we are ninety-nine percent sure our subject is a white male adult, like every serial killer of the last hundred and thirty years. Anyway, thanks for the donuts and brew. Come back in a couple weeks and maybe I will have more for you. Oh yeah, and Emma? Please, nothing about that specific evidence leaves this room. We can't afford to spook this guy.”
    Emma gives an affirmative nod. ""Mum on the details. Thanks again, fellas.""

Didn't know how to answer and my first reaction was to say "" why? "" pretty roughly... I know it was bad and seen her face say it all. She left.

1ptf073,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ptf073/the_mormon_fear/,The Mormon Fear,"Guys, I was thinking during my reconstruction process about something that makes Mormonism continue to have a strong influence on TBMs: Fear.

Mormonism exists because of this main ingredient: Fear.

It's curious to think that the people inside that church are the ones who possess the most fear, fear of making mistakes as if that were something terrible, fear of being without garments, excessive fear of the world. And studying the history of the church, it makes sense that they have this method of keeping everyone under control through fear.

The early members of the church were haunted by persecutions; during this period, they became increasingly isolated from the rest of society, and with this isolation, the church grew with the idea that ""the world hates us, the government hates us, former members hate us, so let's isolate ourselves and shut ourselves off from this evil world that wants to harm us.""

It was this fear that led Young and subsequent church leaders to govern the church in this way, making members believe they are persecuted and hated for having ""different beliefs."" Here in Brazil, the church does what it wants, has immense religious freedom, and is a country where few ex-Mormons rise up as activists against the church (Vania Moore is the most relevant Brazilian activist).

And I've heard many members say they were being persecuted simply because a pastor quoted Galatians 1:8 or because a TikToker talked about Fanny Alger and polygamy.

It's a cult where people live in fear of living authentically. I believe that many of the criticisms and judgments from members come from something called envy.

Whether they like it or not, some will be envious. While we're at the beach, in a coffee shop, or at a bar enjoying the best that life has to offer, they'll be occupying seats, being counted by the secretary like sheep so that the numbers can be put into the LCR. One day, I still intend to have a iced cappuccino cup in front of my old chapel and mentally say: ""I'm free, you cannot have my mind again, I won the battle against you, and I have my freedom.""",4,1766447825.0,exmormon,2,0.83,False

I’m a 35 year old male who has had regular caffeine ingestion in Yorkshire tea and ground coffee with milk for 14 years but I’m feeling really good for it. I’ve had no serious withdrawals so far and a lot of positives except for a bunch of weird dreams around days 4-5 onwards. 

The positives;

My sleep is wayyy better - same hours it’s just ‘more fulfilling’ 

After day 4 - no crash around 7-8pm after work. 

Less need for napping

Feel less thirsty (I’ve replaced t and c with water or milk, sometimes juice)

More focus (not less!) 

Feel less dehydrated

More / better bowel movements (weirdly a plus!) 

Mood stabilised

More energy

No headaches after quitting caffeine

No cravings after quitting caffeine

My reason for quitting tea and coffee was that I am overweight, I’m 6ft but 260 pounds and keep waking up most mornings with a dry mouth - I went to see a private ear nose & throat specialist who said he had had really good results with people who lost 20 pounds (9-10kg) but also ones who gave up diuretics (tea, coffee, caffeine, alcohol). As my dry mouth was starting to bother me I followed his advice completely and on the first day alone my dry mouth was perhaps 20-30% better from not being dehydrated from the caffeine. What a change. I’m never going back to caffeine now. 

Also coffee was a gateway drug for me - I would often have a sweet treat with the tea or coffee and now that’s removed that too. 

Here’s to a better life with caffeine.

And how did you get over the anxiety of telling someone that you are completely inexperienced?","I’m 46 and have never been in a relationship, never been on a date, and am very socially awkward. I have had a few experiences where guys have been interested in me but I either didn’t realize it until after they have given up, or I just panicked and let the opportunity go. I stopped trying at a certain point because how do you explain that you are in your 40s and never been kissed without something thinking there is something deeply wrong with you? 

The reason why I’m asking is because a little over a year ago one of my neighbors in my apartment complex started coming over to say hi to me every time he saw me outside with my dogs. We chat every time he sees me. He seems very kind. He’s a little bit older than me. He has recently started complimenting me a lot, and last time I saw him I kind of thought I saw a little twinkle in his eye when he told me that my haircut looked really good (I had just gotten home from the salon.)

Today I went out to my car to leave for work and there was a Christmas card from him with a coffee gift card and it said to let him know if I want to talk over coffee and had his phone number. 

Anyone have any thoughts on whether he is just being a friendly neighbor or might he be interested in me? I am not sure lol. 

Anyways, I hope there’s others out there who have never dated or who started dating later in life who can tell me about their experiences.

I am a middle aged male who is divorced, unemployed and struggling with bills. I used to have a great job in tech but have struggled to land another. I certainly did not set out to sleep with a married man and essentially pretend to be his wife in bed but that is what happened and I have an open invitation to do it again after the holidays and maybe before New Years. 

I started seeing men out of curiosity and I got catfished by a guy who was older than his pics. He said he could make it worth my while and explained he was in a dead bedroom marriage and simply wanted someone to act like his wife used to in bed. I asked why he didn't seek out women and I guess he got caught and he also said guys were easier and don't demand as much money or want gifts. 

I thought I'd hate it and just thought about the money. I was not attracted to him. However, I found it really easy to take on the wife's role while he did his thing. He was good at it, he's older than me but was better at it than I ever was. I was in a weird place yesterday.. I went into it for the money and also this sort of thrill of doing something I never thought I could do, with someone I never thought I could do it with. Maybe it was part self loathing after my divorce and unemployment. After I did it and had the money, I felt both dirty and also empowered. I felt like I am in control of my destiny for the first time in awhile and I could easily do it again. I also know that unlike a young woman.. this is NOT something I could dip into again or try with others, I got lucky. I used to judge women that did this and I regret doing so.

1pteu09,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pteu09/aitah_snapping_on_my_roommate/,AITAH snapping on my roommate,"im going to try to be as reliable of a narrator as possible and admit my faults in the matter. my roommate and i met a while ago through mutual friends. skipping over how we became roommates, there were a few red flags i regrettably glossed over prior to moving in, such as a sensitive and defensive demeanor when met with feedback or being the topic of a joke (example: our friend and i made a joke about her driving because she almost got into an accident, and she shut down and did the whole im-not-gonna-speak-til-you-ask-what's-wrong. room smelling rank of cat litter but she chalked it up to ""i havent been home but im usually really on top of it!"", etc.). however, we drew up a ""roommate agreement"" to avoid huge arguments and clear boundaries. 

when we first moved in, she would be VERY passive aggressive toward me when i wasn't cleaning up stuff immediately as in within 24 hours, completely reasonable so i obliged, until she would make passive aggressive comments in front of guests like ""you messy girl!"" to make sure the guests knew it was my stuff out, despite often doing the same and leaving her stuff sprawled across our counter. another incident i started to REALLY noticed she's allergic to accountability is when i forgot to lock the door one time, but other than that day, she was always the last one to come inside (she would sit outside on the patio almost every evening. i did not.) she has left the door unlocked numerous occasions but i didn't say anything because it was easy to say ""she must have forgotten"" and lock it myself when i would notice it. the night i happened to forget to unlock it was because my hands were full and forgot, she brought it up immediately and said i need to be locking the door and how she's seen it unlocked multiple times this week despite me barely leaving the apartment at all. again, completely reasonable, my mistake, i apologized but i said okay! so long as you do the same, ive noticed it unlocked after you've come inside almost every single day this week. no big deal, right? except she started to do this with EVERYTHING. she had multiple habits that didn't bother her until iiiii did it, then now there must be a rule in place. okay. whatever.

as the months went on, she stopped cleaning COMPLETELY. there is always, and i mean ALWAYS a dirty dish in the sink. not rinsed off. milk still in the glass just in the sink. food crusted plates piled up. how hard can it be to at least rinse it before leaving it in there? i don't really say much because it is USUALLY cleaned up after a day, but often times, there are food particles left in the sink, and the dishes remain there for 2+ days. i bite my tongue about it because i assumed she is going through a difficult mental state (long story not my business to share). never swept, mopped, took her stuff out of the living room (which she's ALWAYS IN) but this one crossed the line. 

she has two cats. she asked if it would be OK if she left the litter box out in the living room, because she's had it in her room her whole life and didn't want it in there anymore. I love cats, and wanted one of my own, so I said that's OK so long as it is cleaned up properly every day and cleaned out often. Eventually, I did get my own cat. She said to put my litter box in my room because all three cats using the one litter box was just too much. I said OK, because I did get my cat after we had moved in and she had had hers before we moved in. I was being very considerate of that fact. Made no issues about putting the litter box in my room, especially because I have no issues cleaning the litter box every day. well, we had a trip planned to Italy with our friend. After we had already bought the tickets, I had realized that I would not be able to financially afford it because of factors that I will not go into. I was really sad, but I had to make the adult decision to drop out of the trip and miss out on the money paid. However, she also could not afford this trip, which I had no idea about. She was living way above her means, such as getting laser hair removal, planning for an Italy trip within three months, and spending a lot of money on snacks. I would never police someone on how they spend their money, except for the fact that I got an email that one of our bills hadn't been paid. She had neglected to tell me and was never going to tell me had I not brought it up. 

Well, I started to notice a rank smell in our living room every single day. I opened the cat litter box one day, and I noticed that there were two weeks worth of literal cat shit piled up in the litter box that was in the living room. I dumped the litter out and cleaned it with soap and water like it should be done, and refilled it with fresh litter. She didn't even have any of her own litter, so I had to use my own. I sent a long text to her, and I said if this is your mental health and you are not able to take care of your cats, that needs to be something that you can talk about with me, because it affecting my living space as well as yours. I told her that it was quite frankly disgusting, and yes, I did use that word, because at that point it is disgusting. Even though I was upset, I did tell her that if she needs help to clean the cat litter box, then she can always ask me, and I will help her out when needed, but it is not my responsibility and she needs to be cleaning it. I also mentioned that the one time I did see her cleaning the litter box, it was in our kitchen sink. wtf. She didn't even clean out the litter particles from the sink when she was done. You really can't eat at everybody's house. She said OK. 

Well, a month later, every single day I was walking in the living room, I could smell it from the door. The second I walked in. It smelled like cat piss & cat shit in our entire kitchen and living room areas. At this point, I was pretty angry. I sent her a long text and told her that she wants to live this way, she needs to put that in her room, because I'm done smelling that shit. I am a messy person, as in my room is sometimes messy because I get ready and they are usually clothes on the floor in the aftermath of outfits i didn't like, but i always do a deep clean of my bathroom and room MINIMUM once a week. however, I draw the line at dirty. I can't live that way and I don't think it's right to subject somebody else to live that way either. 

after we had a discussion, she basically mentioned that she couldn't afford the cat litter and was stressed out about it. I tried to be understanding about this, however, I still think that it's fucked up to subject somebody else to your dirty behaviors. She claimed that she had no idea that it smelled that bad, but I said I could smell it while in the living room and the kitchen with the door and windows completely open. If you were really cleaning it every night, how did you not get hit with the rank smell every time you open the box? Simple fact, you were not cleaning it properly. she moved in her room and that was that. However, I have noticed that every single time I try to tell her anything, she ices me out and doesn't talk to me for about two weeks straight until she randomly comes in my room and says can we talk? 

She polices me on my tone when bringing up these matters. This is where the am i the asshole comes in. It is extremely hard to be nice to someone who is subjecting you to live in their dirty, dirty, dirty environment. 

there was another matter, where I asked her to send me the insurance details for our flight. I paid the money for the ticket, so that information belonged to me, but it was just under her name. She would not send it to me or forgot to send it to me until the very last minute where I finally was like ""dude I need that information because I'm missing out on $600. i've asked you about four times now and the trip is so close. I need it to see if I can get any of my money back at all."" she then hit me with, ""I didn't think it was that important to you, since you kept saying whenever you have a chance."" this made me really pissed off, because that is genuinely just using my manners. I told her in the real world, people aren't aware of the fact that she can't pick up on social cues like that, and she needs to realize when people are just simply being polite (no, she is not neurodivergent to anyone's knowledge). She got very angry at me and told me to stop talking before I hurt her feelings. We go in and out of these arguments often, because she has a constant issue with how I bring things up to her, no matter how it is brought up. If it is nice, she gets embarrassed (im assuming) and says nothing and offers little to no apology. If it is in an angry or direct way, she also gets upset because I said it ""too mean"" for her grown ass liking. she is EXTREMELY controlling but refuses to admit it and hates when called out on her actions. 

when we were discussing whether or not we would renew our lease together, I told her that I would like to have the room with the bathroom for the next lease, since I let her have it for this current lease and never made her pay a dime extra for it. Prior to the official conversation, she said that she would be willing to switch rooms, because I also mentioned how I was sad about how my room never got natural light, but she loves it dark and gloomy. However, when we brought it up officially, she basically guilt tripped me and said ""well I reallyyyy wouldn't like to switch rooms. but id be willing if you paid more"". I said, well, I think it might be a little bit more fair, since I really wanted it the first time around, but I let you have it. She basically then said ""well, I believe that I should have it because I really consider myself the mom of the apartment"". I was really confused by the statement. I asked her ""what makes you think that about yourself?"" she doesn't cook, doesn't clean, doesn't have a boyfriend like I do, etc. as well as IS BARELY EVER IN HER ROOM ANYWAY. 

She replied, ""because I'm the one that pays the bills and because you have your boyfriend over a lot, I like to have my own little space where I don't have to come outside"" mind you, she begged to be the one in charge of paying the bills. I have told her multiple times that I do not mind doing that if that ever is an issue. She literally begged to have that position. Which is why I'm so confused why she's bringing it up like she's doing me a favor. Additionally, she is always in the living room. I rarely ever get to use the living room for myself. Whenever I do have my boyfriend over, which is admittedly really often (I have asked her if it bothers her at all that I have him over so often and she has always always always assured me that it is no issue whatsoever), we pretty much stay isolated in my room to give her space, while she is in the living room. I explain that that doesn't really make sense since we are the ones that have to constantly leave the room and go outside in the hallway where she is at in order to use the bathroom. She is rarely ever hanging out in her room aside from the mornings where she gets ready, whereas I am always in my room. I'm not trying to punish her for using the living room, except for the fact that she obviously puts herself at a higher place than me for some odd reason. 

An example of this is when I came home one day and she was in the living room watching TV with all of her work material out, sprawled all across the couches and our coffee table, like it is every single day. She asked my opinion on a certain matter about a boy which we had a whole conversation about for almost 20 minutes. When my boyfriend came over, she needed his opinion and approval since ""he's a guy"". She proceeded to have the same exact conversation with him for the next 20 minutes while we were trying to eat our dinner. Not really an issue, I didn't mind so much, but we wanted to carve pumpkins that night. Well, since we were eating in the kitchen, she decided to call her friend and ask the same exact question to her friend and ask for their approval as well. She went outside on the patio for I'm assuming privacy for her phone call, but about 10 minutes later my boyfriend and I walked outside to carve our pumpkins on our patio. She was sitting there full volume on the phone while we were carving pumpkins and I looked at her after about 10 minutes and I said ""hey do you mind if we have the patio for literally just 20 minutes so we can carve pumpkins?"". Again, she had left all of her stuff out on the living room, so I had assumed that she was just going to go back in there and the and the only reason she went outside was because we were inside. I sincerely did not think this would be an issue in the slightest. She then got all pissy and said ""if i have to"". 

about a week later, she was going to have a boy over, and asked me if I wouldn't mind leaving the apartment because she was ""Too insecure for him to see me"" when he is on a date with her. my boyfriend and I went on a date in order to give her some space and privacy. Even when we got home, I let her know and asked if she would like more time, so my boyfriend and I sat in the parking lot for about half an hour playing games on our phone until we finally went upstairs. Well, when we finally had another disagreement, she basically brought up the pumpkin carving situation out of thin air and said ""it really feels like you're trying to place dominance over me and control the space in the apartment which we share lately"", also using the litter box example as something to defend her case as she claimed that I was mitigating what was and wasn't allowed in the apartment. everything that I had brought up has been an ongoing issue that I finally broke over, especially because we have had these rules in place since before we moved in, and she was not following them, so I finally said something. 

The final straw for me is this past week. She is on vacation for about two weeks, and had asked me if I would mind feeding her cats and cleaning out their litter box or if she should have her friend come over and do it instead. I said I didn't mind doing it, since I'm home every single day, and honestly, would rather have the apartment to myself for once, instead of having her friend come over at random times and spend the night just because it's close to her work and convenient for her. The next day, she was basically told me that her friend is just gonna come over anyway. I was a little annoyed, but I did not say anything at the time, because I honestly was OK with it at first. However, the day that she left, when I went outside in our living room, it was full of her shit. She had cookies and brownies all over the kitchen counter that we're definitely going to go bad by the time she got back. She had weed on our coffee table. There were dirty dishes, all in the sink. There was a shot glass randomly just on the counter. The floors were covered in crumbs and various random blotches that needed to be mopped up. She had a bunch of other random shit all across the counter, on our table, in the living room, everywhere.

at this point, I was extremely frustrated, and I told her what do you want me to do with all of this stuff? I was really nice about the way that I asked, extremely casual, simply asking what she expected me to do with it. I also mentioned that I would rather take care of the cats for myself if that's OK, because I kind of would like the privacy to have the apartment to myself. 

Long story short, I got a little annoyed, and said it's for my privacy that I don't want someone here. She asked why it was an issue now of all times, and I will give her that. I didn't say anything before she had left. However, after seeing all of the shit that she had left for me to clean up, I was really frustrated by the fact that I have to live with somebody like her, so I would rather just have the place to myself and have a completely clean apartment for the two weeks that she will be gone, for the first time in a year. I do trust the friend, and I know that she would've cleaned up after herself. It wasn't personal to the friend, it's just that I would like privacy in my own home, especially when I'm perfectly capable of taking care of the cats myself, and there was no need for someone else to come over and intrude on my alone time. She then brought up that when she went to Italy, she claimed that I had not fed the cats. What had ACTUALLY happened, was that I was feeding them every single day and every single night, and taking care of them.  I had taken care of the litter box, their water, and everything. The night they were supposed to be coming home, I sent her a text, and I let her know that the food that she had left was empty, so she will need to go to the store the next day. I did not know that there was another entirely full case of food out in the living room, cause why is it in the living room? Anyway, the cats did eat that night. They did not go a single day hungry. I had fed them some of my own cats food, which wasn't the best option because she is a kitten, but they did eat, regardless. It was one night where they had to eat the kitten food. When she had told me about the food, I had instantly went to the living room and got them their own food. She basically accused me of neglecting her cats while she was out, although she has admitted to abusing her own cats in the past, has thrown a pen at my cats head, screams at the cats whenever they make a peep (yes my cat meows a lot, but moreso when she was just a baby), doesn't clean after them or their bathroom area, doesn't vacuum their cat litter, doesn't play with them but is obsessed with MY cat, essentially neglects every single part of being an adult that has the responsibility of two cats until i say something about it. 

Honestly, there is way too much more to insert here. im not sure if anyone will actually read all of this given the longevity of the post. I'm just asking, am I overreacting? Am I the asshole for being bitchy?",1,1766447370.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

Our schedules line up almost perfectly, which is nice most of the time, but it also means that it’s very rare that I have a day off and she doesn’t (I keep her home during the summer and our schools have the same holiday breaks). I only get 2 or 3 of these days per school year, and since I have to hoard my sick and personal days for actual emergencies, I really look forward to them. Obviously, I love spending time with my daughter, but having a full day to myself with childcare? You all know how much of a luxury that is. My school was closed all week, but hers was still open today and tomorrow (well, it was supposed to be—more on that later). Today, I spent the entire day at the dentist and mechanic, so it didn’t really feel like a day off. Tomorrow was supposed to be a relaxing day all to myself: I was going to treat myself to a pedicure, wrap Christmas presents, sip my coffee in peace in front of the Christmas tree, maybe even take a nap. But her school just called a snow day due to an impending storm, so no more self-care day for me. Of course, I’ll make the best of it, maybe we’ll bake cookies or play outside in the snow. I know I’ll look back one day and be happy we had this unexpected day together. But right now, I’m a little bummed out.

Made a reddit just to tell this story. So I've been single for about 2 years now, very serious relationship ended when I (29 male) caught my gf (28 female) cheating on me. Haven't been all that interested in dating since so I do a lot of things alone which in completely fine with. 

About a year and a half ago there was a WWE event in my city. Decided to go by myself since none of my friends are into that kind of thing. The row behind me is 3 couples all around my age and they notice I'm alone. Extremely friendly people they are they invite me to move up a row and sit with them and enjoy the show together. Instant connection and it's a blast. They make a new group chat and throw me in there and we start texting in it everyday and these 6 people have instantly become my new best friends. Just to make things easier going forward ill refer to them as couples A, B, and C. Couple has been together for 10+ years and is engaged, same with couple B, Couple C has been together for 10+ years and is married with one child. (The child was bot there for what happened)

Every big WWE event after that (royal rumble, Wrestlemania, summerslam, etc..) I host at my place, so it's like a fun once a monthish hang out with my new friends. So when John Cenas final match is announced I immediately know everyone's gonna be at my place to watch it together.

Everything goes fine and the match ends, we're all sitting there just reminiscing about his career when the girl from couple B says ""I'm so glad we got to meet him before he retired"". This is followed by a very long pause before guy B say ""what are you talking about?"" You could hear a pin drop in the room it go so quiet. She didn't respond and he repeated the question and you could tell he was extremely angry and definitely had some kind of idea where this was all about to go. 

If there's one thing I love it's drama I'm not involved in so I am absolutely 100% locked in on this conversation when I hear the guy from couple A crying next to me. I think he's overly emotional about the fight when the entire group collectively realizes what's going on. Guy A has just realized that the jig is up and his relationship is about to end. I've never seen someone fold under literally zero pressure until then, girl B was not hinting at all that guy A was involved so he pretty much told on himself. Girl A then finally says ""I knew you weren't on a business trip you mother fucker"" apparently Guy A and Gal B had been having a years long affair and they decided to go to a WWE event in Indiana where they met Johm Cena at a meet and greet. 

Now I'm a massive nerd, but I don't think I've ever heard of anything nerdier than planning a trip with your affair partner around a WWE event. 

At this point Gal A just grabs her stuff and walks out the door and leave Guy A behind. Guy B is having an absolute  meltdown screaming at Gal B and calling her a whore. I try to calm him down cause even though I hate cheaters I don't think he should be screaming at her like that. This is when Gal C decides its a good time to chime in and starts chirping at Guy A and calling him a cheating bastard and other names. Guy A looks at her and says something to the effect of ""Well guess what? Your man was fucking her too."". So Both Guy A and C had BOTH been hooking up with Gal B for years and apparently they had had MULTIPLE THREEWAYS. 

My jaw is on the floor at this point and this is by far the most exciting thing that's ever happened in my house. Guy A leaves, no idea where he went cause Gal A took their car. Couple B are both sitting on my couch sobbing and and Couple C are now screaming at eachother. She tell him their marriage is over and to get out of her sight. He tells her he owns the house and to bot bother coming home or he'll call the cops and have her trespassed and also tells her that he wants nothing to do with her or the kid anymore. (The fuck did the kid do?, also he's the one that cheated so this is so weird.) Now she's on the couch crying so I have 3 people on my couch absolutely sobbing and I don't think I've said a word in the oast half an hour. 

Without saying a word Couple B leaves together so just Gal C is on my couch crying and telling me she has no idea what to do or where to go. I tell her that her and her kid can stay with me until they figure something out. She has her baby sitter bring her kid to my place and I let them sleep in my bed and I took the couch. I didn't sleep a minute cause I was still fully in disbelief of what I just witnessed.

In the following week I hard all 3 couples ended their relationships. Guy A and Girl B ended up moving in together. Guy B is in the process of moving to a new city. Girl C and her kid just last night moved out of my place and back in with her parents and Guy C is surrendering his parental rights to his child and is still living in his house. (Again wtf did the kid do). 

As for Gal A, last night I said screw it and called her and asked her if she wanted to get coffee sometime. She immediately hung up on me. Ah well can't win em all. Just like John Cena 😭",24,1766446859.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.85,False

Kitsap County Events: December 22–28, 2025

Looking for things to do in Kitsap County the week between Christmas and New Year’s? It’s a quieter stretch, but there are still family-friendly activities, library programs, and low-key local outings happening across Bremerton, Poulsbo, Port Orchard, Kingston, and Bainbridge Island. If you skip out on organized events this week, have a great time with your friends and family!

⸻

Events & Activities This Week

Winter Crafts for Kids — Kingston Library

Friday, Dec 26

A relaxed, drop-in winter craft afternoon for kids during school break. Good option if you’re looking for something indoors and low-pressure after Christmas.

Library Programs Across Kitsap County

Dec 22–28

Kitsap Regional Library branches typically offer holiday storytimes, craft tables, and kids’ activities during winter break. Exact offerings vary by branch, but these programs usually run throughout the week.

Local Movie & Theater Screenings

All week

Local theaters on Bainbridge Island and in Bremerton often schedule holiday films and special screenings during the Christmas-to-New-Year’s window. A solid option for families or anyone looking to get out of the house without a big event.

⸻

Low-Key Things to Do (No Tickets Required)

Holiday Light Walks & Drives

Many neighborhood holiday light displays stay up through the end of December. Bremerton, Poulsbo, and Port Orchard all have residential areas that are still lit up this week.

Downtown Strolls & Coffee Stops

Downtown Poulsbo, Port Orchard, Bainbridge Island, and Bremerton remain decorated for the holidays. Great for walking, grabbing coffee, and using those gift cards.

Outdoor Time & Parks

If the weather cooperates, local parks are a great option this week:

•	Manchester State Park (beach walks, views, history)

•	South Kitsap Regional Park (trails, open space)

•	Waterfront walks in Kingston and Poulsbo

⸻

What This Week Looks Like Overall

This is one of the quietest weeks of the year for scheduled events in Kitsap County. Most holiday festivals, markets, and performances wrapped up earlier in December, and many organizations pause programming until January.

If you’re searching for:

•	“things to do in Kitsap County this week”

•	“family activities Kitsap County”

•	“Kitsap events Christmas week”

•	“what’s open in Kitsap between Christmas and New Year’s”

…this is mostly a week for library programs, outdoor time, movies, and casual local outings, rather than big festivals.

⸻

Heads-Up for Next Week

New Year’s Eve events start popping up Dec 31, especially in Bremerton and Bainbridge Island, so the calendar picks back up quickly after this quieter stretch.",1,1766446516.0,LifeInKitsap,0,1.0,False

And before you ask, yes, I eat about 50,000 to 1 million calories a day. I start my day by drinking a coffee that includes eight Oreos, four scoops of ice cream, chocolate, and 10 shots of espresso. After that, I head over to my favorite local spot, Cracker Barrel, an order a mountain of chocolate chip pancakes. After that, I have a second helping of coffee. For lunch, I go Whataburger to order the exact same thing that the driver in front of me ordered, which is always a ""triple patty burger."" For dinner, I walk around Walmart and HEB aimlessly as I fawn over a tray of fruit that I can't afford, yearning for fruits and vegetables because there is absolutely no produce in the produce section, or at least I'm having a very very difficult time finding it. And when I get home, I make a common McAllen dinner: fried chicken, a family portion of macaroni and cheese, and a towering milkshake.

I love her so much and this weekend I had the chance to go to her family home and spend time with her sister(37f) and her family friends. Her sister was in an awful mood with my gf the entire time. It was truly uncomfortable to be around. She was foul to her, it got to a point my gf cried to me due to her behaviour. She’d shout at her, belittle her, constantly demean her and tell her that she’s being too clingy to me (we kept PDA to a minimum due to us not doing stuff like that infront of family anyway). She refused to watch movies with us and told us that she’s tired then when we went upstairs she spent the entire time making side comments and said she’s going to watch a movie (even though she told us she was tired). She hated how my gf was being attentive towards me by making me coffee, making me food (I mean I’m a guest so I wasn’t surprised) but my gf’s sister told my gf “see how you do all this for her but you don’t bother for me, you’re so performative”. My gf and her sister dropped me off to the bus station and told my gf “ugh I can’t be bothered to wait for her bus to come”

After I left the sister told my gf “I like your gf, but I wish she made more of an effort, I do get positive vibes from her she seems really lovely. But it’s up to her to come out of her shell and make the effort, not for me to do that” she basically hated how shyi was, even though I was shy I still made an effort and spoke to her. But I’ll be honest with how her sister was acting the entire time I was truly scared to speak to her because she’s so mean. She was brutal. Now I feel bad. Idk how to act. My gf said she’s acting like this due to her being in her period and taking her shit out on her. I left feeling so uneasy and I don’t want to go back.

im 16M have autism and i think it is citalopram im taking? and i go to a place where u go to and eventually go back to school im there monday and friday morning (9-12) and wednsday the whole day (9-3)

and its fine

but the last few days i have been feeling horrid like excuse me for the words ima be using

but i kinda feel really fucked up idk how to properly translate it to english i dont think there is a way but how i would say like a cancer really fucking bad i dont want to do anything nor do i want to sleep

and idk why this is happening like my life isnt interesting at all if there would be a button that would make me die and everybody forgot my it would be a 60/40% that id push it with the 60% being pushing it

and i dont do anything all day i just... game thats it nothing more 0 friends irl online i have a few

and to the location i go i met someone we had a nice click and we met up one time we were at my place from 1pm till 12pm but a few days later i made a joke (not even gonna repeat it im so ashamed of it and ik it was really stupid) and he didnt like it which is completly my fault i just have the tendency to find the limits with people so i know what i can do its a bad habbit

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

but idk that idea has been floating around in my head sometimes but hey people come and go and im only 16

it is what it is

but thats only a small part of why i feel ass and usualy i dont really think about it but idk what it is or why it is i just feel FUCKED

and idk what to do with this any tips

i dont wanna game i dont wanna read i dont wanna sleep i dont wanna watch a serie or movie

and my mom will be councling the dr about it but thats tommorow since he aint working rn but i swear to god if he suggest changing meds im gonna lose it these are the 3rd also had zoloft/sertralin and aripiprazol im on meds for 4 ish years rn and the going down in slowly dossage to start the other one is hell everytime i just hope i dont need to.. again

even tough i already feel fucked rn

and u know never had a gf or anything close to romanticly never even held hands which ik is completley fine and normal at 16 and i shouldnt worry about it but idk kinda makes me feel lonely sometimes

that was it sorry if its hard to understand i kinda dozed off on topics but well i typed it so may as well keep it

also this is a repost of a earlier post but it stil applys today and like its been a bit better today but still not great

friday

and i went to the place again today but went home after like 1.5 hours because i became nauseas af in the car when we were going some where probally due to an all nighter+4 cups of coffee in 12 hours with in total like 600mg cafeinee and being cramed in the backseat with 2 others and being on my phone and u know electric cars can feel odly weird at times

so went home went laying in bed went to sleep at like 11.30am and woke up at 6.20pm

i found that just playing lego games for some reason really enjoy it mainly lego hobbit rn or just playing f1 turn on some music and drive just driving, driving and driving but u know it wont always work so id still apreciate some tips

and its not that i cant have fun i can but as soon as i stop i fall down or even when laughing u know i still just feel bad

and i went to sleep at 4 am both on well friday to saturday and 4.30 am on satuday to sunday

and this is the 2nd week of me feeling this way like off days are there but usually not 2 weeks long

and idk i also find myself misserable for complaining and asking advice about this since there are people who have the same as me but much much heavier

and sorry if this is the wrong place its the first that came to mind

monday

i went again today from 9-12 and just got home and idk there is a girl there we have a decent click nothing special and we can laugh together play pool etc

but even if im genuinly laughing idk i just still feel bad well its a bit less but still bad and now that im home im completley sinking down idk how to say it in english like everything ccomming back like comming down

and the doc is available tommorow and then ill hear what he suggest i swear to god i hope he doesnt say med change

ad idk just what to do its been worse now that im home like worse then the lst few days and i want to sleep but i also dont want to i want to watch serie but i also dont want to etc

and whenever i force myself to smile idk what it is idk i feel different? which makes me think im subconsiously forcing myself to feel this way but on the other hand the smile feels forced af

and on the night from tuesday to wednsday u started having toughts not that i would do it but how i would do it the scenarios etc and i said it to the councler well idk actually the right word the dutch word is begeleider

and i just wanted to talk about how i have been feeling etc mentioned that and now were maybe looking for some kind of therapy or whatever

thursday

friday

Just let me get this out of my chest. MT related to kaya dito ko pinost hopefully you guys may relate to me

My mother is already pre-diabetic and lately been monitoring her sugar levels through labs and glucometer. Earlier this morning, she told me to test myself and voila its 151 mg/dL so my mom freaked out.

Me? No because I just had a freaking coffee with milk and sugar and lots of bread not even an hour ago so malamang sa malamang sobrang taas talaga niyan at glucometer pa. I tried explaining to her na taas talaga since I just a carbo-heavy meal and also explaining to her that hindi naman talaga accurate ang glucometer to tell if someone is in diabetic state unlike sa lab tests na for FBS and HBA1C.

Did she listen to me? No unfortunately. She was scolding me for my habits and eating. I am currently 50kg male with healthy vegetarian lifestyle and also exercises and I just had my FBS tested a month ago kasi trip ko lang at it is normal, so I am aware talaga sa state ko. She even told my dad and as early as morning they are both scolding me and I tried to keep my ground and gently explaining to them about the differences of blood sugar tests pero gagi feel talaga sila ang tama kasi sinabi daw ng doctor at they even back it up with their lab tests for FBS about sa normal value.

Jusko di ko talaga alam gagawin ko, para san pa at pinagpaguran ko pagsurvive at ongoing review kung sila pa pamilya ko na walang tiwala sa sinasabi ko? Nakakadiscourage at nakakahina ng loob, so ano ba talaga? HUHU so ayun nga share ko lang.

I don't know where this is coming from, but this profession has been belittled a lot even in my experiences sa hospital duties, palaging nasisisi ng doctors etc. Hopefully, something will change not only my family but for other people as well who continues to belittle us and this profession.

I'm 32F, divorced for eight months. The marriage was bad. Really bad. My ex (35M) was controlling, jealous, would check my phone constantly, accused me of cheating whenever I talked to anyone. He never hit me but he'd punch walls, throw things, scream in my face until I was sobbing. I finally left when he shoved me into a door frame during an argument and I realized my kids (7M and 5F) were watching from the hallway.

The divorce was ugly. He fought me on everything. I have primary custody and he gets every other weekend plus one dinner a week. He was furious about it. Kept texting me that I ""stole his children"" and that he'd ""fix this.""

I've been in therapy for two years. My therapist suggested I keep a journal to process everything. I write in it almost every day. It's private. Really private. I write about my anger, my fears, thoughts I'd never say out loud. Sometimes I write things like ""I wish he'd just disappear"" or ""I hate him so much I can barely look at him during pickups."" Dark stuff, but my therapist says it's healthy to get it out on paper instead of bottling it up.

My mom has always been weird about my ex. She loved him. Thought he was charming and successful and that I was ""lucky to have him."" When I told her I was leaving, she cried and asked if I was sure I wasn't overreacting. She kept saying ""marriage is hard"" and ""he provides for you, doesn't he?"" I tried to explain how bad it was but she just kept defending him. She'd still talk to him sometimes, would ""run into him"" at the grocery store and then tell me how sad he looked.

But she's my mom. And my dad died three years ago so she's alone now. I felt bad for her. So when she asked for a spare key to my apartment ""just in case of emergency,"" I gave her one. She lives ten minutes away. I figured if something happened to me, she could check on the kids or whatever.

Three weeks ago I came home from work and immediately knew something was wrong. My bedroom door was open. I always close it. My journal was on my bed instead of in my nightstand drawer where I keep it. The drawer was slightly open.

I called my mom. Asked if she'd been in my apartment. She got defensive right away, which told me everything. Started saying ""well actually"" and talking really fast. Finally admitted that my ex had called her, said he was ""worried about me,"" said he thought I might be having a breakdown and becoming unstable. He convinced her to let him into my apartment to ""check on things."" She let him in while I was at work and the kids were at school.

I asked what he did. She said he ""just looked around."" But I knew. I checked my journal and I could tell it had been moved, pages were bent slightly. Then I noticed faint marks on some pages, like someone had pressed down on them with another paper on top. He'd photocopied pages.

I lost it. Screamed at my mom over the phone. She started crying, saying she was just trying to help, that she's worried about me, that I've been so angry lately and ""it's not healthy."" She said ""you shouldn't hide things in a marriage"" and I screamed ""we're not married anymore!"" She hung up on me.

Two days later my ex filed an emergency motion for custody. His lawyer submitted excerpts from my journal as evidence that I'm mentally unstable and filled with rage. Things I wrote like ""I fantasize about him getting hit by a truck"" and ""some days I'm so angry I can't breathe."" My lawyer said it looks really bad. That even though it's therapy journaling, a judge might see it as evidence of instability or potential danger to the kids.

The custody hearing is in three weeks. My lawyer is scrambling. I had to get a letter from my therapist explaining that journaling dark thoughts is normal and healthy and doesn't mean I'd act on them. But my ex's lawyer is painting me as unhinged.

I'm so angry I can barely function. I can't believe my mom did this. I called her after I got the court papers and she started defending herself immediately. Said she didn't know he'd do this, that she thought he was genuinely worried, that ""maybe you should have been more careful what you wrote down."" She said I'm overreacting and that she was ""trying to help our family.""

I told her she's not family anymore. That she betrayed me in the worst possible way and I'm done. She started sobbing, saying I can't cut her off, that she needs her grandkids, that she's lonely since Dad died. I hung up.

I changed my locks. I'm looking for a new therapist because I don't trust my current journal anymore, it feels contaminated. I told my kids that Grandma is in timeout for a while and they were confused but accepted it.

My mom has been calling and texting constantly. She showed up at my apartment yesterday and I wouldn't let her in. She stood in the hallway crying, saying I'm being cruel, that she made a mistake but she's still their grandmother. My neighbor came out and asked if everything was okay and my mom left.

Then this morning she sent a long text. Said she's sorry but that I need to understand she was ""caught in the middle."" That my ex ""manipulated her"" and she's a victim too. She said she'll do anything to fix this, that she can't lose her grandkids, that they're all she has left of my dad. She wants to meet for coffee to talk.

But here's the thing. I don't think she actually gets what she did. She's still making excuses. And I keep thinking about what she said - ""you shouldn't hide things in a marriage."" We're not married. She still sees him as part of the family. She still thinks I'm the problem.

My sister (she lives in another state) called me yesterday. Said Mom is devastated and that I should at least hear her out. That she's old and lonely and didn't understand what would happen. That family is family. I told my sister that Mom handed my abusive ex ammunition to take my kids and my sister went quiet. Then she said ""okay I get it"" and hasn't brought it up again.

I might lose my kids because my mom let my ex into my home to photograph my private therapy journal. And she wants me to forgive her so she can keep seeing her grandkids.

My lawyer says the journal thing is bad but not catastrophic. That with my therapist's letter and character witnesses we should be okay. But there's a chance. There's a real chance a judge could see those excerpts and decide I'm too angry, too unstable. My ex's lawyer is good and he's playing the concerned father angle really well.

I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes I see my mom letting him into my apartment, watching him photograph my journal, and doing nothing. She had to have known it was wrong. She had to.

Part of me wonders if I should hear her out. If I'm making things worse by cutting her off completely. If the kids need their grandmother even if she's flawed. But then I remember her saying ""you shouldn't hide things"" and I feel sick.

My family says I'm being too harsh. That she made a mistake but she's still my mom. AITAH?

* Save all the gems, don't waste them on energy since energy can be replenished with time, ads, and other ways
* Try to utilize the appliances and bowls as storage (for example, milk, sugar, coffee and water can all go in the table)
* When theme parks are available, try to complete orders in bulk when there's a 2x timed boost on the tokens 
* Do **NOT** upgrade all of your ovens. You will need them either as storage or to complete different orders simultaneously. This is only for the ovens lol
* If you don't get the options for more energy with ads, restart the app and try again. This will always do the trick
* Save the general generator cards for items like the tourist baggage, antique treasure box, pop-up book, etc. You will need them in times when you're rushing to get an order done, and you can't wait for these items to generate again

1pte5yk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pte5yk,My Cursed Promise: I felt compelled to unlock the Rank X achievement while using the gear depicted in the achievement art itself. So I did that.,"Something came over me when I saw the achievement art. I HAD to try that! This would be my first try to complete Cursed mode, and the first time I would choose to sacrifice my right arm! 

At the very least, I had to have and use this build on the final day and the final battles, that was the *bare minimum* I set myself. It looked less than ideal... Not the strongest weapon or gear, had to savescum Gun Trader to make sure I get that Magnum. 

I did end up using Crown+Coat+Boots much more often. Some tough midgame battles had me switch out into more defense when Sam was tissue paper. (Darryl destroyed us, damn...) Since magnum bullets were rare and valuable, I used the other weapons like the pistol and SMG Special instead, long into the run until I got a steady amount for the magnum. 

I'm glad I could buy the Champion Belt pretty early as Mutt *so graciously* spawned it within a few days. It doesn't show on the art, but neither does anything else, so hey, Sam's just hiding it under his shirt or something I guess. Jewelry slots I would switch around with good resistances like Silver Bracelet, until I could afford to buy the Sapphire Ring. 

I regret that I didn't pick up Tickle with me immediately as early as I could've done so. I did it several days later. Those skills are awesome. I shouldn't have been such a wuss about the HP+STM nerf. 

Also, I had previously blustered that I would take my son Ratthew with me, despite his nerfed stats in Cursed mode, and [make it work out](https://www.reddit.com/r/LookOutsideGame/comments/1p7l3e9/comment/nqyxy6g/)! Well... it was SO much fun, my ratboi being there Copying Dad was the best thing ever. I chose Leigh as my second main party member, because she could use Claws to spare our weapons, and hit HARD. I took Ernest with me when I realized that duh, I gotta have a rat gang if I'm permanently Rat King. Also, he's awesome. 

Jump Attack is a lifesaver anyway in Cursed mode, but with Ratthew and his high Agility, I would spam it even without weapons of my own, and, well... *exploit* the fact that during my save, v2.01 Build 32, Jump Attack would never break your weapons. Yeah you heard that right. (It's going to get fixed... heh...) He can also copy Tickle skills! Or... Vomit!

It was very fun giving Ratthew a Shotgun with the highest ballistics, then have him Copy Dad my SMG's Spray and Pray. Lmao. Or sometimes if a boss was weak to armor piercing, I would have him Magnum Multishot, with Shotguns again. He spawned free bullets with Copy Dad. Didn't matter what gun he had. He could actually shoot *without a gun*, but that's pointless because he would have no Ballistics. 

Other confessions: I savescummed quite a bit, for example to get more Junk from trashcans, receive better pizza when I was starving for STM, or for a couple decent candies close to the endgame. And I used a door encounter predictor mod. For that I see the same logic as how HC Nuzlockers use their mods to have Rare Candies: if the ""optimal play"" is to grind, just cut the corners, save your precious time. In Look Outside, if you want to savescum door encounters, does it matter if you mod it in, instead of tediously doing crosswords to see who shows up and then reloading? I REALLY wanted Morton and other roommates to stay safe on this one. I wanted to recruit them all, and I wanted them to teach Ratthew skills. 

I do wish there was also a mod for previewing Mutt's RNG lol... The Coffee Machine came in within the first week, but I would honestly wanna restart the whole save if I can't get it before the second week... because I have *grudges* towards Mutt. This time, he saved Lockpicks for last, *that shithead*. 

I could've struggled more, I admit. Next time, when I'm not locking my build and trying so hard to get everyone, I could take out the mod. Reduce savescumming. Just try to roll with what the Cursed mode throws me. I won't have the Jump Attack exploit next time, either. 

The first half of the game was pretty tough, as I ran out of stamina and money so often. I had to really strategize and path my way around the building, because saves were scarce. By the midway point, I started having coffee and weapons and big meals, and the JRPG kicked in again. Somehow I got friggin' loaded pretty soon after paying my rent in full, and suddenly nothing could stop me from roflstomping, except for the passage of time... oh and that one time when Comatus instakilled Ernest on the first turn and proceeded to slice the rest our heads off. 

So that was fun. I really should build Gun Dad more often. Okayokay, and accept more of the RNG, since I'm not so intimidated by Cursed mode anymore. If you read all of this, thanks for reading, it was fun to write and revise. 

>!^(We don't talk about my first try, which I abandoned... Don't put on the Filthy Ring with this build holy shit that was so bad.) !<",34,1766445615.0,LookOutsideGame,8,0.98,False

Lower City was the opposite.
Noise. Crowds. Eyes everywhere.


Naturally, they chose the first tavern.


Separate rooms.
Jan paid without comment.


Astarion noticed immediately.
“Separate rooms?” he repeated, hand on his chest.
“How… tragically responsible.”


Karlach laughed. “Hey, luxury!”


Minthara said nothing.
But she saw it the choice, not the caution.


That night, Jan sat with Karlach over beer.
He drank carefully. Listened more than he spoke.


Karlach talked about fear  not of hells or demons, but of one day feeling nothing at all.
Jan didn’t look her in the eyes when she finished. He never did.
He listened instead.


“That’s your thing,” Karlach said gently.
“You don’t stare. You stay.”


Astarion arrived later, wine already doing its work.


“Ah,” he smiled, sitting down.
“The emotional support table.”


He watched Jan quietly for a moment longer than usual.


“You know,” he said, softer than his tone suggested,
“people say Underdark takes something from you.”


A pause.


“But some of us just find our rhythm there.”


Morning came early.


Jan was already awake. Coffee. Bread. Silence.


Astarion squinted at him over a glass of water.
“Did you sleep?”


“No,” Jan replied calmly.
“But I woke up before you.”


Karlach grinned.


Jan added, almost absentmindedly:
“I got used to the night. After Underdark.
It didn’t bother me.”


Mushrooms. Silence.
The Arcane Tower.


Minthara heard just enough.


Later, as they stepped into the streets, she said quietly:


“In the Underdark, solitude is not emptiness.
The Arcane Tower would make sense to you.”


No question.
No judgment.


Just understanding.


Astarion blinked. Once.


“Well,” he muttered,
“I did not have ‘mutual emotional literacy’ on my list today.”

His life has been filled with luxury and power.





One For All still exists within him, and peace is guaranteed after defeating Shigaraki several years ago. It's time to see how he's been doing.





--------------- A beautiful morning in Musufita. We see our favorite green-haired boy sleeping when... Oh, crap, what's on his face?





Izuku wakes up with a face that looks like he hasn't slept in three weeks after burying his face in acid after taking ten punches that left AFO with a potato face... That's how bad his face looks.




Izuku:.... ***He gets up wearily and goes to the kitchen where he takes out the coffee maker and pours ground coffee into a glass before pouring all the milk into the pot and drinking it in two gulps*** Ugh, for crying out loud, I'm turning into Aizawa-sensei.




***Multiple footsteps are heard running from upstairs, and Izuku can't help but wonder how he got to this point.***

-------------

And that's his life: dividing his time between being a good father to his absurd number of children and also being the Symbol of Peace. When he asked the Remnants for advice, none of them were helpful.





I automatically ruled out Nana; she didn't need another Tomura in her life.




Yoichi simply didn't like the idea of ​​giving advice or anything like that. It's not because, after defeating his brother, he's in an existential void, not knowing what to do with his life.



The rest just told him that in cases like these, they're still surprised by how masochistic he is.



And Toshinori saw the situation and said it was time for Izuku to learn what it means to teach. Izuku couldn't help but think about telling his children, for a moment, about the beautiful lesson his teacher gave him after gaining almost uncontrollable power overnight before facing killer robots.



""Clench your butt and yell 'Smash' from the bottom of your heart.""

My whoop recovery score would tank even on days I trained light, and I finally figured out it was the stimulants I was using for work. I tried a bunch of different options to see what works without wrecking sleep.

\- Regular coffee and l-theanine: even if I had my last cup at noon, my deep sleep would drop like 15-20% that night. The half-life is just too long and it was showing up every single time.

\- Nicotine pouches: the focus was great but holy shit my heart rate would spike, like I'd be sitting at my desk and my hr would jump, kept redosing every 30 minutes because they're so short-acting and my hrv was consistently lower.

\- alpha-gpc: it works but it's super subtle, not that immediate ""okay now I can focus"" feeling good for baseline support I guess.

\- phenylpiracetam: works super well but destroys sleep quality overall, REM and deep sleep both dropped considerably.

\- Chewbizz: uses 6-methylnicotine instead of regular nicotine and lasts much longer, has magnesium, k2, and theanine in it but didn’t impact sleep as much as nicotine pouches, considerably better than nicorette/zyn for me

\- l-tyrosine with rhodiola: is fine for mild stuff, shouldn’t take late in the day because dopamine spikes reduce melatonin production. Definitely AM or avoid.

But I learned how important timing is, nothing stimulating past 5pm or my deep sleep is toast and the longer something lasts, the less you're redosing, which keeps your heart rate more stable throughout the day.

Snack - my overnight oats with whole milk, banana, strawberries 11/10

Proud of myself!! I met my energy despite a really hard day. Work was SO busy, my head was going wild (over my chocolate plate, the rice, how repetitive my diet is, whether I need this much food). But I reached out to my dad after work and told him I was finding it hard - as much as he is fed up he did offer some good advice. He reminded me the goal is certainly not to much, particularly with work. My dietician isn't lying to me about my needs and is not trying to overfeed me. He also said something that really helped me. I was explaining I think a week of 2600 will make me gain all the weight back and then I will stop but it was stressing me that I might have to keep this up for weeks or months. He then said, this will become your new normal and you might 2600 for the rest of your life. This makes me feel safe, because it means once I finally get in the swing of this consistently it can become my routine - no up or down - **it is my new normal.** He then went onto say I should cut down on my chocolate intake incase my skin breaks out but I have chosen to ignore this, despite my ED now conniving me I don't like my chocolate plates - progress 

I spent a-lot of the day getting annoyed I didn't try a new 'treat' or any new foods (well actually pilau rice which I have been wanting to challenge for months), or any suggestions. But I really just had to push to add extra cream, nuts, sugar and cheese just to meet the energy and prove I can do it. I also got annoyed that I didn't eat throughout the day, this is something I want to challenge soon (once this crazy spell in work is over), as I have spent this evening in crisis feeling full and convincing myself I have binged and not fully enjoying my food. However, I have learnt a good few things from today -

1. Nothing, literally **nothing** will ever be good enough for my ED. Even though I have met my energy now it is convincing me it wasn't good enough because I ate too much at night and I have just become a nighttime binger, I didn't have enough variety so 'wasted' my energy, I eat the same foods so should just stick to lower energy, there was too much sugar blah blah blah
2. It shouldn't feel comfortable - and it doesn't, because I am actively challenging myself. 
3. Eating slightly 'healthier' seems to help in someways. I.e. sticking to whole foods helps the brain cope a little more but still having treats. For example having cream, nuts and strawberries = calories but whole-foods
4. Flavoured rice is yummy, so proud of myself for the pilau rice!
5. I can do this but I just *have to do it -* despite the feeling of fullness, guilt, shame, disgust, indecision, everything. It is down to me.
6. I still haven't accepted how ill I am. The ED won't let me. Which is making things a lot harder. (it is convinced I am lying about my weight etc)
7. Having a plan is crucial - a member of this sub has helped me SO much with my plans and literally saved my bacon today - so thank you!
8. Feeling full is going to be a needed evil for now 
9. My activity is quite high and doing over 10k steps sometimes 15k isn't ideal for recovery, if I want to keep this up and recover I need to fuel

I am really scared for tomorrow I will not lie, the fullness and guilt are intense, I don't want to feel the way I did today but I also *really* don't want to slip back tomorrow to then to only have to go through all of this again. I am really hoping tomorrow will be easier and I am really going to use the things that I have learnt from today when finalising my plan for tomorrow and going forward to hopefully help! Hope you all are well!

It's about teenagers who find their true selves and learn the importance of true connection but also the problems of ""bad"" connection and comparison. There are dome magic elements though. I'm writting the characters with personality theory in mind and I want to see what y'all think some of the main characters might be

Nornan- he's the ""main"" character who's followed from the beginning. He values friendship and connection a lot but wishes others would value it like him. He's very introverted, emotional, and  curious. Throughout the book he's constantly trying to find a passion that fits him but nothing does he trues several sports, clubs, and activities but Jones of them feel like ""him"". He struggles with self confidence and thinks about how useless he really is. He blames things on himself and has depressive  thoughts and anxiety spirals. He is the first to see visions of vines vines that represent the connections with lepe good and bad. He gets distracted often snd Goes deep into fantasies. He seems crazy to everyone else at times. 

Raven-  It's not the seen that has power its the unseen. She seems like a ""quiet"" and ""emo"" girl to the  people who don't look deep enough, but she has hidden power. Abandoned by both of her parents and forced to live on the streets of Baltimore at 11 ujtill  she was found and moved to her grandparents across the country. Throughout the story she shows her full potential, whether it's connecting with the pepple who go unseen like her, or calling out the injustice that's going on. She writes with an invisible pen that can only be seen with a black light , but whst she writes us powerful!

Vera- She's not just a ""mean girl"". No trash talk and petty drama is beneath her. She takes power very seriously. To the point that she will completely destroy someone just to win a 9th grade president election. Her methods are extreme and irrational . She has lists and rankings of how much of a ""threat "" people are and how ""prestigious"" they are.  Everything is about strategy and getting ahead in the most efficient way possible regardless of who gets hurt. She has a perfectionist mom who's stuck in her high scholl days and wants Vera to be as ""percect"" as her. Nothing Vera does is good enough. She's not skinny enough , mkt powerful enough, and jot popular enough. Vera does learn at yhe end if the story that sgeput her eggs in the wrong basket. She realizes that her connections abd owolke are more important. That does not get rid of her strong personality or her trauma, but she begins to heal. 

Dustin- What's beneath the mask of someone who just feels ao likeable? He is like the ""perfect"" high school student. Perfect grades, athletic, involved, nice, and conventionally attractive. However his personality is buried under layers of practice. He has a deep resentment for the world and for people  that goes unnoticed even by him . That's intill Vera ruins his reputation because she sees him as a threat. She forges a fake ""school threat "" letter and blames it on Jim. While he is cleared due to uncertainty. He begins to grow angry,hateful, tired of injustice. He becomes more detached, pragmatic, and even vengeful. He's not evil by any means, just  not bounded by the control he once had. He eventually learns to integrate this rage and use it for good and to help him with his endeavors

Aiden-  He starts off as someone who sees others as tools, everyone as part of a system, vesseks of control.  He feels like he's lost and has no purpose. He just follows what his successful politician Dax tells him. He makes friends with peolle who are clearly not good people. He secretly is angry with hinsrkf as he feels he wants to have connection tons and be nice to people. He becomes friends with Nornan because he thinks he can use Nornan, but eventually they become close. Nkrnan kwarba that sometimes making quick effeexienr decisions is more important, while Aiden learns to  consider the human side of things 

Wendy- Unfortunately this one might be the most VAPID  and uniterestong character. She grew up in a family with 10 other sisters that look similar to her. She wears colorful dresses and crazy makeup because she wants to stand out. Vera uses her to create drama. She creates a drama page online to spread godsop about peplle that Vera tells her to. She dosent like tge ""evil"" aspect of it and dosent want to hurt people. She just wants to get closer ro Vera and become her true friend. She just wants a unique friendship where dkneo e truly sees her, she just chooses the wrong friends. 

Drew -  what is a person like when they are treated as an experiment and not a person? Drew was literally a test tube baby . Born to two prominent scientists. As a kid he was shown little love. He was fed, dressed, snd had things, bjt his parents also ran experiments on him. It was like he wasn't even human. Raised in a completely sterile environment forced to sleep on a white room. He turned to chaos as his medium. Being a chaotic idea generation machine gave him purpose. He trolled people and spread drama not to be evil, but to get emotional reactions. He wanted to see the emotion he wad robbed of as a kid.  Socially clumsy, overly logical, and a annoying little troll to the ones who don't know him, but really a deep snd unloved person. 

Victoria (Ms Azalea) -   back  in the 1800s there was a young girl who lived in a mansion. Her family was disjointed  abs disconnected, but they held a secret power over the essence of connection. They could not only get into people's heads, but also control vines. However there magic needed a guardian,  she was chosen. She could wield the piercing but she had to keep the mansion and tge family's legacy safe or else she would be cursed to the lowest ring of hell. She was forced to be immortal( untill she found a new guardian) hut she didn't want to put this burden on anyone else. She hid and pretended to be different  people. In her current life she was an English teacher. Someone who guided kids to their potential, but came off as creepy and cryptic to everyone.  Never getting close to anyone and rejecting any friendship advances (usually in creepy ways like putting spiders in people's coffee or suggesting going on a date to a morgue to scare them) she knew everyone's potential and where they would end up almost in a psychic way. She loved to guide people as long as she wasn't recognized. However events begin to bring her magic to light and a witch hunt begins. Chaos arupts as fingers are pointed. Eventually she is cornered and her magic is released. It traps the main characters and forces them to face their darkest truths. She isn't taken down in dome spectacular battle. She is taken down with the power of connection, acceptance, and unity. Exactly what she wanted to teach her students. ",1,1766444615.0,Socionics,8,1.0,False
