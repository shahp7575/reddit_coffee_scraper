1kk1vg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAI/comments/1kk1vg5/first_experience_with_character_ai_maybe_need/,First experience with Character AI - Maybe need some advices?,"Hey guys,

As title says, I had my first interaction with a bot. Decided to start with an anime character I enjoy. If you are familiar you'll know who Yor Forger is.

Just for context which will be important later, its a very shy and polite individual, that works as a Clerk on the City Hall. The work is a disguise and her real job is an Assassin, her codename is Thorn Princess.

Right, I start the chat. Because it was a roleplay and I had no backstory, I said I was new in town and I am a traveller (Which is kinda true since I am a flight attendant). I asked for directions and a place to stay. She says ""Hotels here are either all fully booked or out of your budget""

I said something like ""Oh, you can tell I am broke!"" 

She said: ""Is not hard to assume when you ask a random **CHICK** for directions. (That was the first weird part, she would never refer to her as CHICK, as she is polite and shy. But okay, I moved on). **Hey, I have an idea, I work at a club, maybe I can refer you there** (She never worked in a club, she is a Clerk)

That was really out of character, but I continued and offered to buy her a coffee as a thank you. Our second interaction at the coffee shop she starts flirting (Which is something the character would never do).

For me that was enough since I felt I was talking to a random flirty girl and not the character I hoped, but for a last attempt, just to see how much the bot knows, I said ""I like your rose perfume smell, did anyone called you Thorn Princess before?""

\-She did not recognize her title and just said a generic thing about being pleased by the nickname

Other things I didnt like:  
a) The bot follows a pattern, it describes what she thought about what I said, then follows by what she said to me, which is usually super short and generic, and another paragraph with some action she did.

b) I scrolled this page and it seems like the model ""Soft launch"" is super good. I swapped around models and felt no difference between them, not sure if it takes awhile for the new model to kick in, if its a glitch or what, but I didnt notice anything.

  
Sorry for the big text, I want to ask:  
\- Usually those are trained by somebody, was I unlucky and found a badly trained character or is it a common thing to find inconsistancies like that? The bot had millions of messages and thousands of likes.

  
Thank you! :)",1,1746972536.0,CharacterAI,0,1.0,False
1kk1vdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalHealthFinds/comments/1kk1vdr/do_probiotics_help_with_digestion_heres_what_i/,Do probiotics help with digestion? Here's what I learned after years of trying everything,"For the longest time, I thought probiotics were the golden ticket to better digestion. Everyone said they were. So I gave them a real shot - different brands, different strains, refrigerated, shelf-stable - you name it, I tried it.

But here’s the thing: nothing really improved. In fact, sometimes I felt worse. More bloated. Gassy. Sluggish. I started wondering… *what if probiotics aren’t the solution for everyone?*

That question led me down a completely different path - and eventually, to something that finally worked for my gut.

**Why probiotics didn’t work for me**

Don’t get me wrong, I know probiotics can help some people. But I later learned that when your gut is already out of balance, especially with too much of the wrong bacteria in the wrong places, dumping in more bacteria might just make things worse.

There’s actually something called methane-producing archaea that can slow down your digestion and cause all kinds of discomfort - bloating, constipation, trapped gas. And probiotics don’t target those.

What finally helped me was a supplement designed to reduce those digestion-slowing microbes and heal the gut lining at the same time. It wasn’t another probiotic. It was something else entirely. If you’re curious what I mean, you can see what I found [**here**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-er-vsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=16&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1040&guoid=1040&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds).

**What made this different**

Instead of trying to “add more good bacteria,” this product worked to:

* Calm inflammation
* Clear out methane-producing bacteria
* Support the gut lining
* Restore regular digestion without stimulants or laxatives

It’s made with ingredients like Berberine, Quercetin, Resveratrol, and DGL - plant-based compounds that actually support the gut environment rather than overwhelm it. I had no side effects. No discomfort. Just a slow, steady improvement over the first few weeks.

**The results I noticed**

* My bloating started to ease up after the first few days
* I became regular again (without needing coffee or fiber drinks to force it)
* My energy picked up, and surprisingly, my cravings for junk food faded

I didn’t expect all of that. I was just hoping for less discomfort after meals. But this was the first time something actually made me feel normal.

If you want to see how the ingredients work and why it helped where probiotics didn’t, the explanation is clear [**here**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-er-adv-1?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=16&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1040&uid=2328&guoid=1040&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds).

**So… do probiotics help with digestion?**

Maybe. But not always. If your gut is already out of balance or overwhelmed with harmful microbes, they might not do much - or could even make things worse.

Sometimes you need to clean the slate first. Rebuild the gut environment. That’s what finally helped me. And if you’ve been frustrated by the lack of results from probiotics, it might be worth exploring other options.

If anyone here has had similar experiences - or found something that helped when probiotics didn’t - I’d love to hear what worked for you. Let’s make gut talk a little more real and a lot more helpful.",1,1746972532.0,NaturalHealthFinds,0,1.0,False

Hope everyone is doing good. I recognized a pattern in my life and need serious help in fixing this. Please take the time read the whole thing even though it will be long since I can't explain my problem in a short para.

Everyday I start by doing breathing exercises and meditation(10 to 20 minutes - Have been doing for last 2 year). I am able to start my day by being focused for the first 30/45 minutes each day then the next pomodoro session that I sit for my brain starts going on a swirl( 1000 thoughts) and I try to apply my meditation techniques and then dissuade some of the thoughts and continue studying but after sometime my brain just refuses to focus and then I get distracted into reddit, youtube or anything else online(Anything other than studying is ok). Realising this I take a break I come back again but still the same happens. I seriously don't know what else to do I take coffee in the morning as well that doesn't help as well except for the first session. There is another problem as well with problems like this I start edging/watching porn which results in total lack of motivation afterwards. I seriously don't know what to do. I tried to quit porn but that also doesn't seem to help. Please help with solutions. Are all my problems due to watching/jacking off to porn but I don't notice a serious increase in concentration even if I quit porn for a week. I am having my finals this week but even this doesn't provide me with the motivation except for the first hour. This has been happening for the last 4-5 years and I am seriously not able to find a solution so I am asking for help here since I think maybe I am missing out on something that you guys can catch and help me fix this.

For two blissful days, the mall buzzed only with credit card swipes and the smell of Cinnabon. The Wasp Queen was down, the swarm scattered, and Blart had earned his breakroom donut of honor (glazed, with sprinkles).

But evil never dies quietly.

It started with the alarms.

Motion detectors in the sub-basement—where nobody goes except rats, rumors, and the guy who restocks the massage chairs—started blinking red. Gary’s mop water boiled. A child claimed to have seen “a bee with arms” in the escalator reflection.

Then came the hum. Deeper now. Mechanical. Unified.

The swarm was back.

But this wasn’t chaos.

This was organized.

At 3:00 a.m., the mall lights blacked out. The security cameras flickered with static and glitchy text:
“THE HIVE RISES.”

Blart dropped his coffee.

“Gary,” he said. “They learned.”

He was right.

The wasps had evolved. The foam had failed. They wore armor now—plastic pieces from toy store drones and mannequin limbs. The Wasp Queen? Still alive. Reinforced. Rewired. And angrier than ever.

Paul Blart didn’t panic. He prepared.

Phase 1: The Trap.
He rerouted the mall's HVAC system to blast peppermint oil and vinegar through the ducts Wasp Kryptonite.

Phase 2: The Lure.
He stacked honey buns from the food court in the center atrium, surrounded by hidden speakers blasting “Flight of the Bumblebee” and decoy mannequins dressed like Blart to confuse the swarm.

Phase 3: The Finale.
He called in every favor, every weird side character who owed him a solid—hot dog vendors, mall goths, the girl from Sunglass Hut who once saw him cry during Paddington 2. Even the Buzz & Bubble lady returned, wielding bath bombs filled with menthol and glitter.
The mall had become a fortress.

The wasps entered anyway.

Thousands of them.

Led by the reborn Queen, now more machine than insect, wings made of tinsel and rage, eyes glowing with LED fury.

“You dared sting the Hive,” she screeched in Dolby Surround Sound. “Now feel the sting... of evolution.”

Paul cracked his knuckles. “You talk too much.""

The battle was like nothing before. 

Glitter bombs. Electric scooters jousting through the halls. Gary unleashed “Mopzilla,” a pressure-washer powered by expired cleaning chemicals. Teens fired nerf guns loaded with anti-venom packets. A Build-A-Bear bear exploded heroically.

And in the middle of it all—Blart, charging the Queen on a Segway reinforced with riot shields, flamethrower strapped to his back like a rockstar.

They clashed in front of Macy’s.

Queen struck. Blart countered.

She hissed: “You’re only human.”

He grinned. “Exactly.”

Then he did the unthinkable.

He slammed the karaoke machine’s final track—“I Will Survive.”

The feedback pulsed through the atrium, messing with the hive’s shared frequency. Drones dropped like flies. The Queen twitched, wings sparking.

“THIS... CANNOT... BUZZ—”

Paul flipped off the Segway mid-spin and sprayed one final burst of peppermint cooking foam.

Right. Into. Her. Face.

She screamed, spiraled, and exploded in a burst of glitter, honey, and rage.

Silence.

Then cheers. Applause. Someone yelled, “Mall Dad did it!”

Paul stood amid the wreckage, breathing hard.

“Let this be a lesson,” he said, voice echoing off the carousel. “Don’t bring a stinger to a mall cop fight.”

Later, as the sun rose once more, Paul planted something new on the rooftop flagpole:
A golden wasp sculpture… pierced by a candy cane.

And beneath it, in bold mall font:

“Stung Once. Never Again.”

The mall was safe.",1,1746972309.0,ellykatstans,0,1.0,False
1kk1ryp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1kk1ryp/big_cleaning_fee_and_chores_at_checkout_whats_the/,"Big cleaning fee and chores at checkout, what’s the rule here? Also struggling with how to review this place [US]","We are checking out today. We’ve been here for two nights and it’s a big place (3BR, 2.5BA). The entire stay was over $1100 including a $255 cleaning fee. Host wants us to strip beds, put all towels in the bathtub, and collect all garbage and remove from the house. I guess that means put it outside but I don’t see a garbage can anywhere. Am I being unreasonable to not want to do those things with such a big cleaning fee? I’m happy to do dishes and start the dishwasher, but I feel like if I’m paying a cleaning fee I don’t want to be doing chores. Thoughts? 

Regarding how to review, the place was really not very clean at all when we arrived. Dust everywhere, toothpaste splatter on backsplash in the bathroom, hair in drawers, lots of little things. It’s definitely not getting $255 worth of cleaning between guests. The bedrooms are so sparely furnished, there’s not even a bedside table on both sides of the king bed, nor anywhere to set anything down in the primary bedroom. Our stuff went on the floor or the one chair. The linens on the bed were cheap and old, there were zero extra pillows (the ones on the beds were nasty old super lumpy pillows) and there was ONE extra blanket for three beds. I was cold the first night so used the extra blanket, and had to give my daughter my extra blanket the second night because she was also cold, so I slept in my clothes. The kitchen was poorly provisioned and there was not even salt and pepper shakers, they were empty. No coffee, creamer, nothing. I know it’s not required but most places at least have coffee and tea. Also I’d expect for the luxury price we paid for a luxury stay. The couch was vintage and coming apart, the upholstery was torn and old foam was disintegrating and coming out onto the couch and floor when we sat there (maybe we weren’t supposed to sit on it?). It was pretty disappointing, I was under the impression it was a super nice place (and it is/can be with better furniture and cleaning). 

Our host was great though—he allowed us to host a family dinner with our parents and daughter to celebrate her graduation. Nice guy, super accommodating. It had a surprise third bedroom, which was great because it’s only listed as a two bedroom. I think this has to do with local Airbnb rules and the permit that the host has, he can’t advertise more than two bedrooms. I feel like I’m in a tough spot because I want to be gracious that he allowed us to have people over but also the place was a major disappointment for what we paid. 

TLDR: do we still clean with a hefty cleaning fee? And how to review with a nice, accommodating host but poorly cleaned, disappointing place?

I'm starting to think it has something to do with a need for connection, even if it's just scrolling through memes or checking out stories.

I wonder if it’s more about escaping the boredom or maybe it’s like this weird peer pressure thing where everyone else is on their phone, so I kinda feel like I should too. I mean, it’s not like I always need to know what’s happening online, but the urge is just... there.

The thing is, I’m pretty sure it means I’m not being present and that bugs me sometimes. I've read about how habits are often signals of our deeper needs, like attention or distraction, and it got me thinking maybe it’s about avoiding idle moments that could lead to overthinking.

Like, I won't even give them a chance. I mean, I practically live in my Nike sneakers and drink Starbucks as if it were my own household deity, but I've got this irrational aversion to Adidas and Dunkin'. 

Could it be the branding? The ads obviously play a role, but maybe it's deeper than that. I started suspecting it might be rooted in some kinda personal experiences or sentimental memories linked to these brands. Like, I remember getting my first pair of Nike shoes as a teenager when I joined the school track team, so maybe that's why I've stuck with them all these years.

As for Starbucks, there was this really cute guy who used to work there, and I'd find any excuse to get coffee just to see him 🥰. Maybe my brain is holding onto those moments and kinda makes me prefer their coffee over others, even though I know it's just coffee, right?

I wonder if this kind of thing is happening with the brands we avoid too? Maybe there’s some hidden emotional baggage I've totally forgotten about. It's like our preferences are interwoven with tiny threads of past emotions and experiences that we might not even realize.

1kk1ett,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kk1ett/can_gain_liquid_laundry_detergent_really_tackle/,Can Gain Liquid Laundry Detergent Really Tackle Tough Odors? Comprehensive Review Inside,"Testing household products like the Gain 30772024164 Liquid Laundry Detergent Super Fresh Blast has become somewhat of a routine for me, and I have to admit, it's been an enjoyable ride using this specific liquid laundry detergent. Gain's reputation for producing powerful and well-scented cleaning products precedes itself, and this product certainly doesn't disappoint in several key areas. As a professional reviewer who encounters numerous detergents, this one stood out in ways both expected and unexpected.

**SCENT THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES**  
The first thing I noticed with this liquid laundry detergent was its ""Super Fresh Blast"" scent. It's truly a sensory experience; the fragrance is both vibrant and long-lasting. My family immediately commented on how fresh our clothes smelled even days after washing. The scent doesn't overpower, but it’s clearly noticeable, giving your wardrobe that just-washed freshness throughout the week. From t-shirts to bedsheets, everything came out of the laundry smelling absolutely divine, which is not something every detergent achieves at this level.  

**EFFICIENT CLEANING PERFORMANCE**  
One of the major highlights of this detergent is the 3-in-1 formula that combines odor elimination, deep cleaning, and fabric freshness. Last week, I tested it on a coffee-stained white shirt that I expected would need extra effort to clean. Surprisingly, just one wash cycle removed the stain completely, and the shirt looked as good as new. Because it's HE-compatible, it performs well in high-efficiency machines like the one in my laundry room. Whether you're using cold, warm, or hot water, the detergent adapts seamlessly to all temperatures, which adds to its versatility.  

**Check [Gain 30772024164](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0c35ndzh2/) deals on Amazon now.**

**USER-FRIENDLY DESIGN**  
Its packaging is another upside. The sturdy container has a design that makes it relatively easy to pour without creating a mess, though it does get a little heavy when it’s still near the full 154 fl oz capacity. I appreciated the clarity of the measuring cap, making it straightforward to get the correct amount of detergent for different loads sizes. Works like a game-changer for someone who tends to overuse detergent out of habit!  

**MERITS**  
- Outstanding scent that lasts for days.  
- Strong cleaning power against stubborn stains.  
- Compatible with all machine types and water temperatures.  
- Safe for various fabric types.  

**AREAS OF CONCERN**  
- Bulk size can be a bit cumbersome for those with limited storage options.  
- As much as I adore the scent, it might feel too strong for individuals with fragrance sensitivities.  
- The measuring cup could have been designed with clearer markings for even better ease of use.  

**ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS**  
Comparing this to Tide’s PODS with stain remover and OxiClean formulations, I found Gain’s liquid detergent to offer a much more affordable scent with extended freshness. Whereas Tide dominates in the stain-busting department with a more clinical approach, Gain’s detergent shines for everyday freshness and an approachable price range. Arm & Hammer detergents, which I’ve also tested, often get praise for their baking soda-powered cleaning but fall short in creating a memorable after-scent like this one achieves. Gain truly positions itself well by blending performance with an indulgent sensory experience.  

**VALUE PROPOSITION**  
While reviewing competing products, I often find myself reevaluating the worth of paying premium prices for certain formulations. Gain’s detergent strikes a near-perfect balance between high performance and affordability. It brings clear advantages in terms of fragrance strength and versatility without tipping toward being overly expensive. You’re not merely paying for cleaning capability but for a complete in-wear fragrance experience that rivals high-end options.

1kk1ets,https://www.reddit.com/r/HollandAmerica/comments/1kk1ets/realistic_expectations/,Realistic expectations,"This might not be a popular opinion here, but I wanted to post about my very recent Alaska cruise on the Eurodam.  I think that I went on the cruise with higher expectations than I should have had.  I'd been reading (and watching videos) for a while before the trip and everything was about how amazing cruises are in general.  I knew I wanted to be on a smaller ship and certainly didn't want the more ""party"" atmosphere of the larger ships, so my complaints are certainly NOT about the size and demographics on Eurodam.

For me, it was the incessant push to get more money out of passengers that was probably the most annoying part of the cruise.  Seemed like the majority of the day's activities were promotional items to get you to buy more...foot analysis, spa packages, photos, shopping promos, bingo cards, excursions, art auctions, etc.  The menus always had ""upsale"" items, too.  Want lobster in the dining room? It'll cost more.  Want room service for pizza?  It'll cost more.  Many daily activities had an additional cost, too. 

Also, the entertainment was pretty ""meh.""  Again, I wasn't looking for world class performers, but some of it was just painful.  We walked out of a couple of things.  For excursions, expect crowded transportation on old buses (one bus smelled like mold, another was an old school bus where people had to sit sideways because there was NO leg room since it was designed for children), lots of people all at the same place so there's lines, lines, and more lines.  I don't doubt that there are probably some amazing excursions, but again, expect a much higher cost for those.  

Food on the cruise?  Not so great, either.  Lido buffet was almost always crowded and I'm really not the type to enjoy walking around with a plate of food while I try to find an empty table.  Dining room service was sloowwww. We were always seated quickly, but after that, there were long delays between ordering, between the appetizer and main, etc.  Several times, in both the buffet and in the dining room, I never received the drink I ordered (water or iced tea).  I'd purchased the Quench beverage package but that was a waste of money.  Long lines to get specialty coffees, many exclusions for what could be ordered with QBP and I wish I hadn't bothered.  I'm certainly NOT a food snob, but bread was always cold, food was usually underseasoned, or overcooked (mush veg), or undercooked (almost rare beef), etc.  Granted, between the buffets, main dining room, afternoon tea, and room service, there's PLENTY of food...but expect it to be more like cafeteria food than fine dining.

The best part of the cruise, to me, was the rooms.  I had an Ocean view room and it was always kept very clean.  Ice bucket was kept full, had towel animals on 3 days, chocolate left in the room at night on 2 days, I'd often see the room attendants in the halls and they'd check to make sure everything was ok.  The employees at Guest Services were also very efficient and welcoming.  Employees in the buffet area tried...it's just a lot between clearing tables, getting drinks and utensils for everyone, etc.

So for me, this was my first and last cruise.   I know there are people who absolutely love cruising, but my pockets aren't that deep. :\\  Yes, I could have booked an inside state room to save money, but the push to spend more, more, more is everywhere on the trip and even though I expect some of that, it was too much.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

Hello vets, not an emergency as my boy has already passed but I guess I’m just looking for reassurance?

12 year old male tabby DSH cat, up to date on all vaccines, was on special Hills prescription food after an incidence of bladder crystals in 2017.

This morning while my husband and I were drinking coffee, our boy Marley made a weird sound and then just collapsed. My husband ran to him, thinking he was choking but there wasn’t anything in his mouth or throat. Marley was just completely limp and couldn’t stand or keep his head up. We raced as fast as possible to the closest vet, and they tried to resuscitate him but unfortunately he was already gone. 

The vet said that his heart was already stopped by the time we got there, and it may have been a blood clot that he threw and it went to his heart or brain. We didn’t ask about a necropsy because honestly it wouldn’t make a difference.

We got to spend some time with him and give him cuddles and say goodbye, he will be collected for cremation and return of ashes. The vet reassured us that he likely didn’t suffer or have any pain, she didn’t see any sign that he had bitten his tongue or damaged his claws from scrabbling or anything.

We were told that there was nothing we could have done, and as I read online I see so many cases like this. But I can’t help but wonder if I should have known something was wrong. He was a very healthy cat, even the vet said this morning that he didn’t look his age, she would have guessed he was 7 or 8.

by Jonathan Healey (Kindle $1.99)","**""AN** ***ECONOMIST*** **AND** ***NEW YORKER*** **BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR • A fresh, exciting, “readable and informative**” **history (*****The New York Times*****) of seventeenth-century England, a time of revolution when society was on fire and simultaneously forging the modern world**. **• “Recapture\[s\] a lost moment when a radically democratic commonwealth seemed possible.”—Adam Gopnik,** ***The New Yorker***  
   
**“\[Healy\] makes a convincing argument that the turbulent era qualifies as truly ‘revolutionary,’ not simply because of its cascading political upheavals, but in terms of far-reaching changes within society.... Wryly humorous and occasionally bawdy”—** ***The Wall Street Journal***  
  
The seventeenth century was a revolutionary age for the English. It started as they suddenly found themselves ruled by a Scotsman, and it ended in the shadow of an invasion by the Dutch. Under James I, England suffered terrorism and witch panics. Under his son Charles, state and society collapsed into civil war, to be followed by an army coup and regicide. For a short time—for the only time in history—England was a republic. There were bitter struggles over faith and Parliament asserted itself like never before. There were no boundaries to politics. In fiery, plague-ridden London, in coffee shops and alehouses, new ideas were forged that were angry, populist, and almost impossible for monarchs to control.  
  
But the story of this century is less well known than it should be. Myths have grown around key figures. People may know about the Gunpowder Plot and the Great Fire of London, but the Civil War is a half-remembered mystery to many. And yet the seventeenth century has never seemed more relevant. The British constitution is once again being bent and contorted, and there is a clash of ideologies reminiscent of when Roundhead fought Cavalier.

*The Blazing World* is the story of this strange, twisting, fascinating century. It shows a society in sparkling detail. It was a new world of wealth, creativity, and daring curiosity, but also of greed, pugnacious arrogance, and colonial violence.""",3,1746970834.0,ebookdeals,0,1.0,False

I feel ashamed and broken.","I (F) need to get this off my chest, and I don’t want to tell my friends because I feel so ashamed and stupid. Maybe someone here will understand.

A few weeks ago, I went on a date with a guy I met online. Before we met, I was very upfront with him—I told him I’m not built for something casual, that I get emotionally attached easily, and that I’m looking for something serious. I even described myself clearly, including that I’m plus-size and only 4’11”, just so there would be no surprises. He said he was totally fine with everything.

Our first date was actually sweet. He brought me to a nice restaurant, then to a coffee shop afterward since I don’t drink alcohol. He was a gentleman, soft-spoken, and said he wanted to see me again. I believed him.

That same night, we got intimate. It wasn’t something I planned—but he made me feel safe and wanted, and I trusted that it was the start of something real. He didn’t act overly sexual at first, and his words made me think he genuinely cared.

After that, he became distant. He wasn’t very communicative. I had to initiate most conversations. Plans kept getting canceled or pushed around. I even dressed up for a planned meet-up that never happened because he messaged me last minute to say he might be working until 1am.

Despite the mixed signals, I still held on—because he told me he missed me, that I excited him. Then he asked me to be his girlfriend. And I said yes. I really wanted it to work.

Then one night we were talking, and I asked him a question he didn’t like. He said it was stupid, and then he slapped me. Not very hard, but enough to freeze me. Enough to show me that I wasn’t safe emotionally or physically.

Then came the final message:
“Also baby you are too short, I don’t think we are compatible.”

That crushed me. I told him my height and body type before we even met. He saw me in person. Slept with me. Asked me to be his girlfriend. And suddenly, after all that, my height and size were a problem?

I feel so used. So humiliated. I’ve only ever been with two men—my ex of four years, and now this guy—and somehow, this hurt more than my breakup.

I keep blaming myself for being naive. For trusting. For hoping.
But I also know—deep down—this wasn’t my fault. He manipulated me. He made me feel like I mattered, and then dropped me like I was nothing.

I don’t know how to forgive myself yet. Or how to stop feeling like no one will ever love me again.

I also had some reservations as to our compatibility early on, but never firmly acted on them. Approximately three months ago, the alternating intimacy and distance, coupled with my accumulated resentments, culminated in my inquiring as to whether she saw us moving toward anything more solidified. Her answer was vague and evasive, so I announced a desire to distance myself.

I felt confident in the decision: she was at a place where she wanted to focus on herself and have fun, and I wanted to find commitment in the next couple of years, so our goals were simply incompatible. Plus, she had appeared to take an interest in other people, as she’d gone on at least one other date that she confirmed and appeared to flirt pretty heavily with others. Disenchanted with the ambiguity over exclusivity, I’d pursued a few other possibilities myself (albeit reluctantly: she had my heart.) We both seemed fine with it ending. 

However, after inviting me to a coffee in the aftermath of that “breakup” conversation, she came over to my apartment and we were intimate. The lone difference from pre-“break-up” intimacy was some awkward conversation in between bouts of activity during which we both claimed to feel “conflicted.” What I recall her asking was whether I might “be patient.” Because I felt spellbound by her, despite my rational misgivings, I clung to that seeming indication that with a brief break during which she attended to her mental health, we might pursue something legitimate in the years to come.

After that evening together, all signs of affection seemed to evaporate. She ignored me altogether when we saw one another, made passive-aggressive comments toward me in the company of our colleagues, and generally behaved in ways that were strikingly rude, which I found weird, given that we’d apparently agreed to remain friendly. 

I began to give up on the prospect of friendship after her no-showing a couple of events I’d invited her to without so much as a text explaining her inability to make it. The last straw was her agreeing to hangout after a work function then bowing out as soon as the event wrapped. She sent what seemed like a rather half-hearted “sorry” text afterwards, but I was tired of trying to keep up some semblance of an amicable connection, so I didn’t acknowledge it for some time. After a couple of weeks, I figured I was being childish, so I sent a simple “no worries,” to which no reply ever arrived (I didn’t expect one.) I just knew she had a history of being ghosted by former intimates, and I couldn’t bear inflicting that upon her, as disappointed as I was in the whole situation.

Days later, I noticed that I’d been added to a group chat by her, as she was organizing a hangout for our cohort. I was surprised to be included, but was touched by the gesture, and took it as a sign that there were no hard feelings and we could be collegial in the future. Anyway, I woke the next morning to see that she’d removed me overnight, despite my not interacting with the chat. Given the platform that this was on, everyone would be able to see that I’d been singled out for removal, so this felt particularly aggressive, and possibly like a bid to ostracize me from a small, tight-knit community essential for my professional development over the next several years. 
I deactivated that account in embarrassment, but resisted the urge to block her on other platforms. I don’t know if she deleted or blocked my phone number, and I won’t be reaching out to verify.

I guess what I’m looking for is some insight into why she’d do something like this. She was never overly public about the fact that we were seeing one another, so to do something that’d presumably invite questions as to why she’d second-guess including someone whom she was frequently seen alongside strikes me as unusual. Also, what, if anything, should I do when everyone is back on campus, in the event that this is what I fear it to be?",1,1746970447.0,AskMenAdvice,5,0.67,False

The setup began with her parents visiting our home. They seemed to really like me and arranged for us to meet in person. 

I traveled to her city for our first meeting. We'd never spoken before - her parents preferred we meet in person first before starting phone/text communication. We had coffee and talked for about two hours. The conversation flowed naturally - we shared personal stories, had great banter, and the vibe between us felt genuine and comfortable. I left feeling really positive about the connection.

There was one thing that struck me as odd at the time: she mentioned that she used to place a lot of importance on guys being muscular and tall, but claimed she didn't anymore after her past experience.

Some context about her: Six months ago, she was engaged to someone else through an arranged marriage, but broke it off because the guy was controlling about her career and generally toxic throughout their courtship.

The day after our meeting, her parents contacted mine saying they needed time. My parents responded that we weren't expecting an immediate answer and suggested that we continue talking to get to know each other better. Her parents said their daughter needed time before any further communication.

A few days later, her parents called again with an apology - their daughter wasn't interested in moving forward. The reason? She wanted someone taller. For reference, I'm around her height, maybe 1-2 inches taller (I'm 5'8""). Her parents seemed genuinely apologetic and mentioned they were trying to convince her.

They even arranged a call between me and her older sister, hoping she might help persuade her. I had a great 30-minute conversation with the sister, who explicitly said she really liked me. But even she couldn't convince her younger sister.

It's been a month now, and I still can't get this woman out of my head. I know it sounds ridiculous to develop feelings after just one meeting, but the connection felt real. I've met 10-20 other marriage prospects before and never felt this kind of connection.

I'm debating whether to reach out to her directly on Instagram - not to push for marriage, but just to talk with zero expectations. My thoughts keep going back and forth:

On one hand, I'm disappointed that she'd reject me over something like height when everything else seemed to click. On the other hand, I wonder if she might still be healing from her broken engagement and using height as an excuse because she's not ready for something new.

Please talk me out of this. I feel like I'd be sacrificing my self-respect by contacting someone who rejected me over physical appearance, but I also don't want to regret not trying one more time.

1kk0ulj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/1kk0ulj/best_coffee_in_louisville/,Best coffee in Louisville,"Just got back from Chicago, and one of my favorite rituals every time I go is hitting up Metric Coffee on the morning I leave. If you’ve been, you know they roast their beans right in the shop , which contains this big industrial space with a massive roaster. It’s easily the freshest, most flavorful coffee I’ve ever had. Every time I come back to Louisville, I get a little deprussy knowing nothing here really compares. It’s that kind of coffee that’s so good you barely need sugar or flavors because the coffee IS the flavor. It's just not fair 😭


Anyway, I’ve accepted we probably don’t have anything quite on that level here, but I’m on the hunt for the next best thing. I’ve had Sunergos, which is solid. North Lime, though decent, is wildly inconsistent. Their syrup pumps are constantly stuck, so the drinks are either way too sweet or completely flavorless. One time I ordered the Lavender Suit and the barista said they were going to “pour the lavender with their heart.” It ended up tasting like I was sucking the floor of a Bath & Body Works.

Heine Bros is just okay. Starbucks is mostly sugar masking bad coffee. So are there any local gems I might be missing? I’m looking for coffee that’s fresh, flavorful, and doesn’t need much added to shine. I live in Lyndon, so my usual go-tos are North Lime, Sunergos, and Bamboo, but none of them quite scratch the itch. I’m totally willing to drive across the city if there’s something that’s actually worth it.

Appreciate any insight!

also sorry for how long this is but i want to give you all the context.

i (22f) and my friend Sally (22f) have known each other since senior year of high school, we never really interacted then we just went to private lessons together since our mothers had a mutual friend and she lives really close to me.

after high school we found out that we got into the same university and the same major and everything and since we are particularly neighbors and uni was about an hour and a half away our mothers suggested we go together.

Sally had a school friend who also got into the same university as us let’s call her Mary. 

Sally and Mary basically ignored my existence the whole time we were riding to uni together and even tho i was hurt about it i tried to ignore it and tell myself it’s fine it’s because they’ve known each other longer.

At this point i made this friend group at uni and things were going well for me, then i found out that Mary transferred about 2 weeks in, so now it was just me and Sally.

We were amicable but that’s it we still never talked much or anything and she never tried to get close to me at that point.

About a week after Mary transferred Sally had already found herself a group of friends and everything seemed fine. (important for later)

Our parents made this agreement then that they would alternate who drives us to uni since the bus or ubers took forever, so basically today my dad drives us then tomorrow Sally’s dad and so on since we both don’t own cars or anything.

Things went on like that for the first year or so and actually me and Sally grew to kind of dislike each other because she would fight with me if i was even 1 minute late to pick her up.

But then the “alternating who drives” agreement turned into a “whoever is free drives us both” situation and as you can guess Sally’s dad was always “busy” or “tired” or “had work”, so now dad would us us like 95% of the time.


I started to notice that Sally would sit by herself a lot and non of her friends really attended most of the time so i started inviting her to sit with me and my group and this is when we started being friends.

But then in our second year of college i had a falling out with my friend group which is another whole story and Sally invited me to sit with her group (they were 8 girls).

Everything was going great for about the first year or so of me hanging out with them, they welcomed me and treated me nicely and i felt lucky to have them, until it all changed out of nowhere.

I was constantly left out of a lot of things, i was always ignored whenever i talked, left behind whenever we were walking together, if i disappeared or didn’t go to uni  no one would notice, i was the invisible friend.

i would even tell Sally jokingly that i’m sure they had a secret group chat without me in it and she would swear up and down that they would never do that and that i was their friend and part of their group now. (important for later)

for instance, when its one of their birthdays, they would always plan ahead of time, everyone has to be free to celebrate and they would choose a thoughtful gift etc. But for my birthday, on one of them they got me donuts as a group gift then went to eat in this place that i told them i don’t eat from since their food gives me food poisoning and most of them weren’t even there lol, and when i said i’ll just leave because i don’t want to end up poisoned or just sit there while they eat , they actually let me leave and went there anyway.

it got to the point where i wasn’t just ignored but also treated horribly, for example i was sitting with 2 of them while the others weren’t there and they were literally whispering to each other and just leaving me out, and when i tried to join in and talk with them one of them (let’s call her Anna) literally yelled at me “will you just shut up?”.

i was so shocked i didn’t even say anything and just got up and left.

all this time i still stuck around and kept giving them excuses, i also tried voicing my concerns about how i was treated multiple times and i was always met with “don’t be so sensitive it wasn’t intentional” , “we’ll do better next time” and “its all in your head”, but nothing has changed.

i started distancing myself and not always going out with them until one of them finally noticed, let’s call her Jessy.

Jessy and i had a long conversation that day and i, again, voiced my feelings and told her about the “Anna incident” and she said “she must have been joking” (she definitely wasn’t her tone said it all) and said she will talk to her.

And even though i told Jessy that i don’t want her to talk to Anna about it she disrespected my wishes and still did, and when i confronted Jessy she said “someone had to” and “i only told her you’re upset with her nothing more”.

After that Anna came to me and said “I’m sorry i don’t know exactly what upset you but i’ll call you later to talk about it”, and of course that call never came.

Then one day, it was Jessy’s, they wanted to get her a number of gifts as a group, they made me go buy most of the items myself and told me they would “pay me later”. when that time came they calculated how each one should pay wrong and basically i payed all the extra money lol, Even when i said they calculated it wrong no one cared or payed me anything.

On top of that, one of the items i bought was this blouse that Jessy SPECIFICALLY said she wanted and when she tried it on she didn’t like how it fitted her, so she just gave it back to me and told me to “return it” and get her something else even though this shop has a no return policy.

And then of course i was ignored all day and left out, that day they basically just made me run errands for them, buy the gifts, get us drinks do this do that.

I was so fed up by the end of that day from how i have been treated since i started hanging out with them (by that point it has been a year and a half) and also Sally and i were having some issues before of that, and i just shut down until it was time to leave (and yes no one cared).

Since me and Sally live close to each other we took the bus home together and she finally noticed that something was wrong with me.


At first i didn’t want to tell her what’s wrong because honestly what’s the point? i already did multiple times anyway, but she kept pushing until i finally told her. she told me i need to communicate that with the rest of the group and i told her no i already did a lot and nothing changes, which she didn’t like.

She also pushed me to talk to her about the issues the two of us were having, which is did and she kept giving excuse after excuse, then she said “is there anything else you’re upset about, cry baby?” which was my last straw because i specifically told her before that i hate being called that and that i hate how she always belittles my feelings and told her “i told you so many times not to call me that”.

She got defensive and said “i’m sorry it was a joke, i always say it to Jessy and Anna and they never got upset” i told her “i’m not them and we’re having a serious talk now you need to choose your words more wisely”.

And for some reason she got so mad when i said that and shouted at me in the middle of the bus “choose my words wisely? i do choose them wisely who do you think you are to tell me what to do ?!”

Again i was so shocked i didn’t say anything and just sat there crying silently till the end of the ride.

An hour or so after we got home her mom called my mom and holy shit how she flipped the whole script and somehow i was the bad guy in all of this. (also why are you making your mom call mine you’re an adult hello?)


We haven’t said a word to each other till the end of the summer vacation, i didn’t reply to the group chat at all as well, i would only open it so that the notifications didn’t pile up but i never read anything, and again no one cared to even ask me what’s wrong.

About a month after this incident the new semester began. On the first day i offered to pick Sally up like always but she refused. they saw me sitting by myself and they all sat together and ignored me, no one called or even said hi to me.

Until lunch break i was eating in a corner by myself then i heard footsteps approaching and heard Sally and Jessy’s voices talking about how i was “imagining things” and “overreacting for no reason” and laughing about it. 

They couldn’t see me at that point and when they did and realized i heard them their faces went white and they awkwardly said hi to me.

Jessy gave me a hug while Sally was refusing to even look at my face, then Jessy told me to come sit with them and i stupidly agreed.

They left first and i followed them a few minutes after only to find them all huddled over each other and whispering and the second they saw me they all stopped talking and sat straight.

i felt so uncomfortable because they were obviously talking about me so i stayed for like 10 minutes then gave them an excuse and left.

Later that day i sent a long message on the group chat thanking them for taking me in when i had no one but that i felt always ignored and left out and i couldn’t take it anymore and that i wish them all well then left the group chat.

Again no one cared or said anything to me except for this girl, let’s call her Karen, she was the only person who was nice to me in this group, and she was also treated almost as bad as i was (we’ll get to that later).

She checked on me and made sure i was okay and told me that she’ll always be there for me whenever i needed her.

Jessy also texted me but it was just to fight lol. She told me that i was overreacting and that no one had done anything to me, and that even the one time Anna treated me like crap (it wasn’t the only time) she apologized and what more do i want.

I told her that Anna doesn’t even know what she apologized for because she never called me to discuss it , and Jessy said “it doesn’t matter because she apologized” (excuse me what?).

By the end of that week Karen texted me and asked me if we could talk so i sat with her at uni, she asked me how i was doing and if i felt better after i left the group.

I said “yeah honestly i feel so much better now that no one treats me like that” and thats when she told me that she has been feeling like they treat her like crap too for years (she was friends with them first 3 years at that point) and whenever she talked to them about it they would tell her the same crap that they tell me.

We talked for hours that day and boy oh boy do we have the exact same experience with those people.

She said that she only stuck around because i was her only friend but now that i left she feels even more left out, and that what i did really validated her feelings and opened her eyes.

She said she has been wanting to leave too but was too scared that she will be alone if she did. I told her that for me being alone feels better than whatever that was, and that she should do whatever is best for her mental health, whether that was staying or leaving.

we cried and hugged, then she told me you should’ve still texted Sally about her mother though. I was like “huh?”, then she told me that Sally’s mom had underwent some surgery .

I asked if she was okay and she said yes, i told her i didn’t know about that then Karen said they were talking about it on the group chat. i told her i didn’t read anything they sent but that ill talk to Sally later.

I texted Sally later checking on her and her mother and apologizing for not saying anything sooner because i didn’t know, which she didn’t believe and called me a liar but i proved it to her.

We texted a lot that day about everything that happened, it was really bad though ,you can never get anything to her head because she still thought i was overreacting and that i was even the bad guy.

I apologized multiple times for so many things even things i wasn’t wrong in, but she didn’t apologize even once.

I also found out that she has been going around to other mutual friends and telling them that we’re fighting which didn’t sit right with me because why are you getting our mutual friends into our business and telling them only your side? so i confronted her about it and she said she only said that we’re fighting and she didn’t get into any reasons or anything, and she said how can i think of her that way and that she wouldn’t do anything like that.(important for later)

She said that cutting her off was extreme and that she thought we were closer than that, i told her i didn’t cut her off i just left the group, if she wants to remain friends only the two of us we can work on that to which she said “i’m not gonna leave my friends to hang out with you”. 

I said that remaining friends doesn’t mean that she has to choose between me and her friends but fine she can do whatever she wants.

We didn’t talk again for weeks ,then one day we were on the same bus home from uni that’s when she approached me and asked to talk.

I was so exhausted and mentally checked out at this point but let her talk anyway, she said some crap about how she doesn’t want to let all these years of friendship go to waste and that she loves me.

i said i love her too but that i was so tired and sick of everything and that i stayed for way too long when i shouldn’t have and put up with all of the disrespect, she said “same i swear even my friends keep telling me how they can’t believe that i keep putting up with all your crap but i love you thats why i stayed.” girl WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU DAMN.

I just knew there was no point in replying to whatever she says so i just kept nodding my head. She asked if we can be friends again like how we were and i said “We’ll see”.

That was probably one of my worst decisions ever because not long after the fights started again. I started picking her up again on the way to uni and she would get mad if i’m 1 minute late to pick her up, like she would not talk to me the whole way and once we arrive she would get out of the car and leave without a word.

But it’s even more insane because a lot of the times she would be the one who is late on important days even (like we had an exam for example), and by late i mean 15 minutes or more and would make me and my dad wait for her in front of her building like some kind if chauffeur, then she would act like everything is fine and would even get confused if i got mad over it (double standards much?).

It got to the point where her mom would call me every morning on the days we’re going to uni and DEMAND that i hurry up like i’m her servant, and would say stuff like “stop being lazy and hurry up” or “you don’t need to drink your coffee now just drink it in the car”. (the entitlement???)

One day her mom went into HYSTERICALS because i texted Sally the day before telling her that i might not go to uni tomorrow because i’m feeling sick, and she called my mom telling her how Sally will now be late to uni because of me and literally freaking out over the phone saying “what will we do now”, mind you i ended up going to uni that day and my mom told Sally’s mom that we’ll pick her up still but Sally’s mom said no and kept playing the victim card.

And it didn’t stop there, Sally’s friend group (who are now my former FG) were so childish and petty towards me, would shove past me in uni, would run the other way while laughing if they saw me in a place, one day we were in a lab and there was only one chair left beside one of them so i sat in it and that girl YANKED herself from her chair and stood far away just so that she wouldn’t set beside me.

Another incident, we had a lot of group projects that semester where we chose our partners, there was this group of 3 girls whom i knew but wasn’t very close with so i worked with them, we had this one weird incident which really annoyed me but other than that they were okay workmates.

Sally would work with her friend group and other 3 mutual friends of ours, which is didn’t know about.

I made the mistake of mentioning the incident i had with them in front of Sally, because at the end of the semester we were told to partner up in groups of 7 individuals for a project.

I partnered up with the same 3 girls as usual so now we needed 3 more to go, i saw the 3 mutual friends and asked them if they were in any group yet and they said “no”. Then i asked if they wanna join our group and they agreed so we added them.

The next day Sally was giving me the silent treatment on the way to uni when i picked her up, then out of nowhere she said that she’s upset with me so i asked why.

She said “why did you TAKE our friends when you know that they’re always with us in group projects”. so i said “first if all i didn’t know that, second of all i asked them if they were partnered up yet and they said no how is that my fault?”

She said “they felt pressured to say yes and didn’t know what to say” yeah wow. i told her you can take them back if you want to then it’s not like i forced them or something.

The ride was silent after that and again she left without a word after we reached uni, and for about 2-3 weeks after that we would still pick her up everyday on the way to uni and she wouldn’t say a word to me not even a “hi”.

Her mom even had the audacity to call my mom and tell her that we make Sally feel “unwelcome“ everyday when we pick her up, thats when her and my mom had a long call and it’s insane all the stuff that Sally would tell her mother about me.

she told her stuff like how i didn’t like the 3 girls i worked with on projects so i decided to “replace them” with the 3 mutuals and that i did it on purpose to spite her and that i knew they were always partnered with her.

and how Sally was always nice to me and was “gracious” enough to let me sit with her and her friends when i had no one and that i left her all alone when Mary transferred and that i never invited her to sit with my friends and i.

And basically stuff that is all lies, we later had a joined call the 4 of us (me and Sally and our moms) and when i told her about her little conspiracy theory of me going after our 3 mutual friends because i didn’t want to work with the usual 3 girls i work with and that they’re actually still in my project group and why the hell she would make all that up , she got silent and whispered to her mom “why did u tell her that i said that” (oh so you didn’t want me to know what you said? why? because you know that its a lie??).

I didn’t mention the other stuff that she said because there was no point in doing so, and my mom told me to just let it go and be amicable with her, which is honestly didn’t want to do and wanted to cut her off then and there.

We still drove her to uni after that and she went back to normal as if nothing happened at first, then her shitty silent treatment continued for whenever she pleased, then she would become all friendly and talkative again whenever she pleased, and god i’m so sick of the ups and downs. Even my friends and our mutual friends saw it with their own eyes and commented on why she is acting like that and why i’m putting up with it.

On top of that later on i found out from our mutual friends that she said she “didn’t tell our business to” that she actually told them our business and not just that she did the same thing she did with her mother and lied about things to make me look like the bad guy.

And after that too i found out from Karen that Sally’s friend group (+Sally ofc) indeed made a secret group chat without me when i was still hanging out with them and told Karen “we’re make a secret group chat without OP, do you want to be added or not?” and when she asked why are they doing that, they refused to give her any reason so she said “i don’t want to be a part of it then”.

I honestly don’t know what to do at this point, i really want to cut her off but i don’t know how or where to start or what to tell her? how do i bring it up? 

I’d appreciate any advice. and thank you to whoever made it this far

Do you guys cup your beans when you get them? How? How different do they taste from your pourover brews? Does cupping help you somewhat come up with a recipe or a method that would be good for the coffee?

I haven't tried cupping with coffee professionals before, I just do it with my girlfriend at home whenever I buy beans after watching videos from James Hoffman and Morgan Eckroth. Sometimes I don't really know what I'm talking about or what notes I can taste. Sometimes what I taste differ wildly so much from the notes on the packaging, but I just like keeping it fun than taking it too seriously.

• Milky cake was roasted a month ago (I've read that this one is better if you rest it longer)

• Volcan Azul - I wanted to get a different one from The Barn but they didn't have it in kofio so I got this! I've never had coffee from Costa Rica, and I'm trying different coffee varietals from different countries and regions hehe (I wanted the Rwanda Mahembe) 

• Karambi Beansmith's - I tried to looked for the same Rwandan Mahembe beans (red bourbon, if I remember it's also from the same region and process) and found it from different roaster. It's roasted a bit darker, but I could taste the same notes! Really loved the black tea notes of this beans that I had to look for it. For some reason I tasted peach too! It's kinda like peach tea.

As I mentioned in my first post, my hemorrhoids really put a damper on my ability to live fully and freely, especially for the last 3 years. I chose the surgery, despite the possibility of extreme pain for several days, because I simply could not live with the idea of truncating my happiness for the rest of my life with no hope of recovery. Please don't think of any of this as medical advice, just my thoughts and things for you to discuss with your doctor, NP, or surgeon.

I want everyone to know that solutions are out there, especially if your hemorrhoids are still small enough to be a minor annoyance. Yes, you might have to press the subject with healthcare providers who'd rather ignore the problem, or are reluctant to help you pursue more aggressive treatments. Schedule those follow ups, ask for referrals to specialists and surgeons, show them photos of your condition if you must. Don't allow the healthcare system to ignore you. It may cost you money out of pocket. But the hundreds or even thousands of dollars you have to pay today will probably save you tens of thousands of dollars in the long run. More importantly, you'll have your freedom and fully functional, healthy body. As the saying goes, ""The healthy person wants many things, the unhealthy person only wants one thing."" Take the uncomfortable steps to regain and keep your best health.

Here's the update on my situation:

**I had very little pain** after the first day of surgery. I mainly credit my surgeon's skill for this. The value of a skilled, careful surgeon cannot be overstated. Secondly, I believe the Exparel was highly effective for me. I still needed to stack Aleve and Tylenol to keep myself comfortable with the pain level ranging between 1 and 2 when I was holding still or moving slowly. Without the long-lasting nerve block I believe I would've been at 4 to 6 level of pain. That's endurable, but sleep would've been fleeting. When the Exparel wore off my baseline pain level rose to a 3 on days four and five. I wouldn't have received it if I hadn't asked several times, so don't be shy about discussing this with your surgeon.

I had very few spasms and no painful bowel movements for the first five days. I asked for and received Flexiril, a muscle relaxant, and I believe it made a big difference. Relaxing your pelvic floor is necessary for urination and bowel movements, and shifting the tightness downward by 20 to 30 percent is a big difference. Many people choose Valium for this instead. I have a family history of addiction and wanted to avoid addictive medications, so I opted for Flexiril. The medication made me very drowsy. I basically slept 14 to 16 hours a day while I was taking it. I got sick of the incessant sleepiness, so I stopped taking it the morning of day 6. After that I started to have anal spasms when I'd pass gas and for about three hours after defecation. They were uncomfortable, spiking the pain to a 4 or 5. If I'd been having them just after surgery it would have been awful. Sleeping heavily and for long periods those first few days was doubtlessly good for my recovery. Talk with your provider about the best possible muscle relaxant for your situation.

I was given a prescription for Oxycodone, but didn't need it. The risk of addiction and constipation is so high with opioids that I was only going to use it if I found myself in truly unbearable pain. If I were redoing the process I would have requested Journavx instead. It's more expensive, but in my opinion it's worth it to avoid addiction. As it turned out, my discomfort was manageable with over the counter pain meds.

**Drinking a lot of fluids is imperative for recovering from this surgery.** Plan to drink between 1 and 3 gallons of fluid per day for the duration of your recovery. Water, a variety of juices, broth, and decaffeinated tea or coffee need to become your best friends. I love decaffeinated green tea, so I've been drinking two quarts of it a day. If you become dehydrated your recovery will be delayed. If you get constipated you can easily reinjure your anus and rectum, extending your recovery by several days or even a couple weeks. Do whatever you can to avoid this. For the first 48 hours after surgery I didn't feel like eating solid food, and for the next two days I only ate very small amounts, not even a small breakfast worth of solid food. I simply didn't feel like it. I think this was because I had a lot of swelling and inflammation. My body weight went up by 8 lbs by the morning of day 6.

**Stool Softeners and/or laxatives are crucial after this surgery**, and I've come to believe after any surgery. You will be given at least one anesthetic and narcotic during surgery. I was administered fent and Propofil. These meds basically bring your digestive system to a halt and it takes a couple days for your GI tract to fully recover. After my gall bladder surgery the first movement was hellish, I basically passed a 3-inch long, 2-inch wide lumpy stone. If I'd had to pass that after this surgery I'm sure I would've seen God and all the Saints.  Thankfully, I started Miralax 2 days before the surgery and continued it after. I also added Magnesium Oxide before bed. My movements were 90% liquid for the first 4 days, painless, and over quickly. You want soft, small, and over with quickly. For the first 3 days I also passed a lot of blood clots. I knew I was on the mend the morning of day 4 when there were only a few.

On day 6 I started shedding water weight. The morning of surgery I was at 179 lbs, but had eaten no solid food for 40 hours and drank nothing for 14. I probably would've been around 183 if I'd been nourished and hydrated. I got up to 187 lbs on day 5. I'm currently at 177. I expected to lose 10 lbs after this surgery, but only dropped 6, so I'm calling that a win. I'll hold this weight for the next few weeks until I'm able to start doing hard workouts again.

I ordered two 100-count boxes of gauze, though I only figured I'd need one of them. I just opened the second one this morning. Make sure you get an ample supply. I had two use two pieces at a time until yesterday, when the blood and drainage dropped enough to only need one.  I didn't really enjoy the sitz bath thing, but rinsed the wounds thoroughly with warm water and baby shampoo every 4 to 5 hours. I also bought adult diapers just in case, and wound up needing them at night.

Yesterday, the last of the external stitches dissolved, leaving only a few small scars. I'm finally able to sit again, though I need to use a soft cushion. Since I only stood or laid on my side for over a week, this is a welcome addition. There's still some swelling and tenderness. I have soreness for a couple hours after taking a dump, and a mild jolt of pain when I cough or laugh. But, I also haven't had to take any pain meds for the last two days. I still have some blood and drainage. Sitting with gauze between my booty cheeks is impossible, but when I need to sit or drive, I just wear an adult diaper. This morning I put one on, went to the gym, and did some slow walking at incline and a few machine lifts with very lights. Avoiding reinjury is my number 1 goal, but I feel I'm nearing the end of this long ordeal.

**The best part of all this is having no hemorrhoids.** I really can't describe how good it feels to not have to spend 20 or 30 minutes standing in the tub, pushing my ass back into my ass after going number 2. How nice it is to not worry about whether I'll have to rush home if I need to go when I'm out in public. To not deal with bleeding or random pop-outs when I have to carry something heavy or climb stairs. I still have a few weeks to go on this journey, but I once again feel as though the world is an exciting and wide-open place waiting for me to discover it.

Wherever you are, whatever your physical or mental condition, **please don't let your health problems hold you back forever**. Take that first step of reaching out for help. Describe your problems, and let the professionals you're working with know you're willing to do anything to get through it. Prioritize your diet and exercise. You may not be able to be in perfect shape like you were as a teenager or in your twenties, but you can have it a heck of a lot better than you do now. You have all my best wishes and support.

I've been trying to slow down my extraction times, but have been relatively unsuccessful. I'm assuming the sour taste is primarily an extraction problem. I'm trying to stay in the more budget end of things. 

-16.5g - StumpTown Hollar Mtn (Roasted 3/17/25) (Best they had at the grocery store)
-Had the grinder set to 30 clicks off zero per some review off the Internet (newbie visual: coffee grounds looked in the ball park), shots were fast(10 seconds). Tried going to 15 clicks off zero, barely any change.
-This video is the best looking shot so far. Looks like 15 seconds from first drop to goal weight, but I have the grinder set to 1 click off zero (so there isn't any room to grind finer)
-Aiming for 1:2 yield but getting 35-40g out

I'm using a WDT tool and tamping with even pressure. Granted I'm new, so I'm assuming my technique is abysmal. 

51mm Bottomless portafilter with a 16g basket (off Amazon). A 51mm/1.7mm puck screen, because it was cheaper than upgrading the shower screen (not sure I notice any significant difference with the puck screen other than a cleaner shower screen). My only thoughts are that the water flow out of the shower screen is uneven causing channeling? Or the holes in the basket aren't great, but that shouldn't cause my shots to run fast. Shower screen has been removed and cleaned. 

This was my best attempt to choke out the machine and shots are still fast and sour. Even accounting for poor puck prep, I'm assuming I should be able to get closer to a 30 second shot? Thanks in advance!",1,1746968794.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I was walking to work the other day when this happened again - jaw pain, vomit, and then relief. Except it happened 5 times in the row, the 5th time I already arrived to the office and I had the space/privacy in the restroom to completely vomit everything including my dinner the night before. My vomit was acidic, but I feel like that should be expected early in the morning when all I've eaten was a piece of bread and coffee.

I've experienced this a couple of times before, sometimes while outside and sometimes at home. I still haven't figured out what triggers it. I do remember that one time I was eating a fruit that I was dipping in a little bit of salt before eating, but I added too much salt in one bite, and the saltiness triggered it. Not sure if it really was the salt, because I don't recall eating in all of the other times it happened. There was another time I was walking outside and I whiffed a smell I didn't particularly like and it got triggered. It wasn't a punget smell or anything like that, just an unusual smell that I didn't like, say like a smell of wet cardboard or something.

Searching my keywords 'jaw pain' and 'vomiting' has led me to this subreddit. I don't really think this is GERD since it just happens to me once or twice a year and I think it would or should be more frequent if it was indeed GERD? I guess I just wanted to post this here because I'm at loss at what this is and I'm hoping I could get pointed to the right direction. 

None of the doctors I've been to have been helpful - I've been to GPs, gastro, ENT and they've all pointed to nothing. The last GP I went to after my episode last week told me to eat easy to digest food for now, and that there's nothing she can do really if the symptoms aren't that frequent. I ate fast food, coffee, spicy food after that appointment, none of which have triggered it. I'm still eating things that would upset my stomach just a little bit like curry or dairy just so I could have any idea at all. It has gotten me nowhere so far and it's taking its toll on me.

I came home after being out in the day and she was warming up dinner. She asked if I would like some, I said maybe later my head was hurting and I really wanted a coffee. She then accuses me of going out with my friends to eat lunch and that’s why I don’t want to eat her food. I get annoyed at her accusing me and she starts yelling. I end up eating dinner first anyways and just having my coffee after. She claimed I don’t want to eat her food and that I disrespect her dinner. 

Anyways I had thought this had blown over as I folded laundry after and did some cleaning around the house. This morning I woke up early to make her breakfast for Mother’s Day. Even though I honestly internally didn’t want to worship someone who always makes me feel like crap, I knew I should because if I didn’t the fallout would be bad as well. I also made dinner reservations which I told her about a few days prior. Well she sees the breakfast and starts yelling and I said she could eat it if she wants but idek what we are arguing about anymore. She ends up throwing the breakfast on the floor like a toddler destroying multiple cups and dishes. The food and coffee is still all over the floors as I type this out. She then begins to attack me which I got on recording (I live in a state where it’s ok to record so long as one party consents) and I need to know I’m not crazy. I’d attach it if I could, but basically she follows me around the house screaming how I never make her happy, she wishes she never had me, that I treat her like garbage and that I’ve never made her proud. She continues to say may god damn me and that I’m not a good Muslim and that she doesn’t want to come to my white coat ceremonies or anything. My dad just stood and watched the whole thing.

I’d call the police to intervene but I did that when I was 16, she was more physically abusive at the time. I then got guilted by my whole extended family for doing that to my mom and I dropped the charges and said I made the whole thing up. It was a whole year process of them trying to see if I would go back on this lie and I stuck it through and then eventually was so close to 18 I guess things got dropped. In all honesty I don’t know because I was so young at the time. 

I don’t know what to do. I start medical school in a few weeks. I need to move across the country and have just been trying to hang in there. Maybe I should move earlier but I’ve been on waitlists to other schools I like more and don’t want to move and then get in somewhere else and then have to move across country again. I also just really am trying to save up money and just spend time with people before I never see them again. 

Sorry if this is a mess I honestly am just pretty shaken up by the incident as it was just maybe 5-10 minutes ago and I also am on mobile. Thanks to everyone who reads and listens. ",8,1746968387.0,raisedbynarcissists,9,1.0,False

1kk0eo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/1kk0eo4/is_this_covid/,Is this Covid?,"On a Tuesday evening recently, I noticed a tickle in my throat and a dry cough. By bedtime, my throat was a little sore. I woke up in the middle of the night with a full blown sore throat. I thought it was all allergies, as I was traveling and had spent a lot of time outside.

By Wednesday morning, my throat seemed better (I had taken Advil in the night due to pain), but I had this extremely wet cough that seemed to come on so suddenly. While running errands that day, I just felt “off”. 

I came back home to my moms house where I was staying during my travels, and got into bed. Around 2pm, I started to feel some chills. At that point my symptoms were a fever, chills, runny nose, wet cough, TERRRRIBLE HEADACHE (it was seriously the worst), and body aches. 

By evening, the body aches seemed to have gone away but the other symptoms stuck. My mom bought me a 90 count box of Kleenexes and in one day, they were gone (plus, I tear my Kleenexes in half because I’m so frugal!! Haha). 

Thursday was a lot of coughing, blowing my nose, and laying in bed. I couldn’t sleep at night because I was coughing too much and I couldn’t nap during the day for the same reason.

Come Friday evening, my mom asked me if I was able to get up and go for a walk. I took some ibuprofen to reduce a fever and was able to go for a walk, which felt great. I needed to get out of the house. Friday is also when I noticed that I had no smell and certain things didn’t taste the same. 

Friday night, I actually slept a little bit and woke up at 4am absolutely drenched in sweat. My fever had finally broke by itself, which is when I really started to feel less rundown.

Those days were the worst of it. 

On Monday, though all along I had been thinking this was just a cold, I started to get nervous about the flu and Covid. I bought a kit that tested for all 3 and they all came back negative.

Saturday through Thursday consisted of a TON of coughing and nose blowing (I blow my nose a lot of general because I hate the sound of sniffing). Thursday is when I left to come back home to Colorado.

Since being back, I am coughing waaaaay less during the day (thank God, because my ribs are so out of place that it’s super painful), but still coughing at night. When I was home, I also noticed a little vibrating sensation in my lungs, which scared me..almost like stuck mucus…? The other day, I also started blowing out orange mucus which I had honestly never seen before.

Yesterday I finally called a doctor and had a virtual appt. She said she wasn’t worried due to the fact that I’m getting better. She said if I spike a fever again or can’t get out of bed one day, then I need to be seen in person. 

Here’s what weird though…since being sick, my coffee tastes sooo weird. Almost like no taste at all. Just bitter. And sometimes I’ll get these weird chemical smells. 

I tested positive for Covid about 3 years ago and after it was over with, I would smell cigarette smoke randomly for months!!!

So I’m wondering if my Covid test was wrong. At the same time, I have a big family and my little nieces & nephews refused to leave me alone when I was sick, so wouldn’t they have gotten Covid if I had it??",4,1746968189.0,COVID19positive,3,1.0,False

If I'm chatting with a guy on Grindr and we get to the topic of meeting up I usually propose some kind of casual date while making clear I'm down for hooking up afterwards, but people aren't really into it. On the other hand, if I'm talking to someone on tinder or something and we meet up for a date it becomes clear the other person is definitely oriented towards something serious, which is great but just not what I'm looking for at the moment. Then the date would usually end without a hookup and with me not wishing to continue seeing that person because our interests aren't aligned.

1kk05zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1kk05zd/the_hopefully_100_correct_subnautica_lore/,the (hopefully) 100% correct subnautica lore + theories by me (massive spoilers and yap),"Subnautica\_gesamt



A long time ago, though definitely longer than 1,708 years (as one of the aliens present on 4546b is that old, according to alien biological history), the aliens known as the Precursors started their existence. Much later, they began to expand to other worlds (Kharra contagion profile) and later learned how to upload and store their minds as data, as well as bioengineer new bodies out of multiple other species (alien biological history).

\--> (The body engineering comes after the expansion because that's how it is for humans in Subnautica).



At some point during their expansion, they discovered the bacterium Kharaa on a different world.

This bacterium killed 143 billion people on their core worlds and led to a lockdown (Kharra contagion profile).



Following this lockdown was the plan to create a cure for Kharaa. While it wasn’t harmful to them (as they could just create new bodies), it was harmful to every species their bodies were bioengineered from, as Kharaa could evolve to hurt those species (dialogue: Scan two body components).



The plan involved going to isolated worlds and building research facilities to find a cure (Kharra contagion profile).



Either before, during, or after that, the Precursors discovered Earth, possibly between 1,875 - 900 BCE (the PDA entry ""Alien Statue"" hints at a connection between the alien statue and Centaurs from Earth) or the Alien Carving (which resembles the Yin Yang symbol, which on Earth can be traced back to the Yin Yang Jia of 304 - 240 BCE) or at least the 13th century (ancient Earth blade). More on that later.



As we found out, one of those missions happened on 4546B (because the destroyed alien base in SN1 is literally named the Disease Research Facility, just like the Disease Research Facility mentioned in the Kharra contagion profile). These research facilities stored pure Kharaa samples and used them on specimens.



The leading scientist was, as we found out, AL-AN, the guy from BZ (dialogue: Build the first component).



After the aliens found and captured the Sea Emperor, a Leviathan excreting an enzyme that could lay Kharaa dormant, they observed how the Peepers (a fish able to propel itself using water jets) swam up to the Emperor, puked out what it ate, then proceeded to eat the enzyme and swim up to different parts of the crater while ejecting the enzyme, slowing down the progress and losing any kind of survival instinct.

They then built a tunnel system for these Peepers all around the map (Peepers Entering the Containment Facility, Peepers Entering the Containment Facility, Enzyme Host Peepers Leaving the Containment Facility, Enzyme Host Peeper).



They also found out that the Sea Dragon Leviathan could produce a similar enzyme.

AL-AN went against his directive, stealing a Sea Dragon egg and incubating it, which led to the Sea Dragon's mother destroying the Disease Research Facility. Although it was true that the young could indeed create an enzyme, the disease contained in that facility went rampant and infected 4546B 1,000 years before SN1 (Fossil Data PDA entry).



The planet was then shut down.



During the shutdown, bigger Leviathans either built up immunity due to biomagnification (as Peepers are at the end of the food chain) or were already immune (Reaper being immune, Leviathans not being able to get infected in SN1, Sea Dragon being immune).



Word needed: Transgov:



Trans-gov - An independent authority in de facto control of at least one solar system and phasegate.



Warning: The following may be changed in the future because it was already removed from the game.



Now, let's jump to the 21st century, where something like a great war happened because it's stated that at the point of traveling to new planets, Earth's territories were part of a singular Transgov: Sol (entry was retconned but it fits).



Then, phase gates were invented, and Sol started their expansion.



However, fairly quickly, those colonies wanted independence, and Sol lost their territory to the newly forming Transgovs (Trans-Gov History: Sol).

The Transgov then started fighting in the so-called Great Expansion.



In the mid-22nd century, the defense manufacturer Alterra was formed, which supplied Sol but then later also parted from Sol and began supplying everyone else, which ultimately led to Sol's already crumbled dominance (canon).



Alterra then grew and became so large that when they said they would stop every supply, it ended the Great Expansion.



Every big Transgov then sat at a table and signed ""The Charter,"" a legal contract agreed upon by 37 Transgovs that stopped the Great Expansion.



In order to enforce ""The Charter,"" ""The TSF,"" a military police force charged with enforcing the terms of the Charter, independent of, but funded by, the Trans-govs, most importantly Alterra, was formed. (Trans-Gov Profile: Alterra Corp.)



By the way, Sol ended up being so small that they had to accept their position and terraformed planets and used different alien lifeforms to even give life to lifeless planets. Growth was sidelined in favor of balance and efficient use of space and resources. The flattest social structures in the Federation, with no internal currency, high self-sufficiency, and high citizen satisfaction.



Anyways, after the war, China's hard-to-reach outer space worlds were no longer valuable, so they were left to starve. --> They declared independence and claimed their infrastructure. They are a minor Transgov but expand quickly (because they are at the outskirts and built into every direction, even towards the Ariadne Arm).



Also, during that time, the Mongolian mining corporation Torgal was created.



Some time later, the Mongolian mining company Torgal, as well as the Mongolian Transgov, started a cabal to build phase gates to the Ariadne Arm.



In this relationship, the statically more important Torgal Mining Corporation was supposed to bring the needed resources for the project, and a few years into the project, they already had mines and space stations in the region. (Trans-Gov Profile: Mongolian Independent States).



But where is that region?



The game only tells us a few locations altogether:



The first thing that mentions it is the designation of the planet we play on, ""4546B,"" meaning we are in solar system 4546, on the second discovered planet. It's also mentioned that 4546B is located in the Ariadne Arm.

\--> So, if we go by normal rules of naming celestial bodies (like Kepler-2 being named that way because the solar system is named Kepler and the planet is the second one discovered), we can say 4546B is part of the Ariadne Arm of an unnamed galaxy and that it was the second discovered planet of the solar system. Easy, right? Well, not so much, because we still don't know the most important part: the galaxy.



So, according to every piece of information so far, the game could either take place in:

A) The Milky Way that wasn't completely discovered yet,

B) The Andromeda Galaxy (that was already discovered according to the Sunbeam),

or even

C) A new galaxy?



Let's first rule out the Andromeda Galaxy.



Because even though it is the only other galaxy named, it's rather unlikely, as the person dropping the name is saying:

""This is Sunbeam. Y'know, Aurora, we're from a little Trans-gov on the far side of Andromeda, and we have a saying there.""

Thereby not telling you specifically where he is from but just telling you a rough location.

It wouldn’t make much sense for him to introduce himself just with ""from Andromeda"" if we were in the Andromeda Galaxy. That's like meeting someone in the US and asking where they are from, and they say, ""I'm from the US."" Like, yeah, no shit, but where specifically? Him telling you that they are from the Andromeda Galaxy implies that we are not in fact in the Andromeda Galaxy, because if we were, that information would be completely useless.



That leaves Option A and C.



(Alterra launches the Aurora)



The ultimate answer to the question is told to us by the Aurora mission orders as well:



""PHASEGATE ANNOUNCED FOR THE ARIADNE ARM: ALTERRA LAUNCHES THE AURORA

The furthest reaches of inhabited space are due to expand, as Alterra Corp launches a newly-constructed capital ship, carrying a phasegate bound for the Ariadne Arm.""



""Furthest reaches"" is talking about the Ariadne Arm here, meaning the Galaxy arm itself is ""newly discovered"" (as in has no phasegate connection). And as it would be unlikely that it is a newly discovered unconnected part of the Milky Way (because humans already discovered Andromeda), it would be most likely that they at least discovered or connected every galaxy arm in the Milky Way.

So, the only answer left would be a new galaxy.



This is also supported by the Mongolian Transgov, the first Transgov who started the expansion into the Ariadne Arm, being an outer galaxy Transgov, because naturally, an outer galaxy Transgov would have the shortest way to the Ariadne Arm if the Ariadne Arm were part of a new galaxy.



Meaning we are in a newly discovered galaxy in solar system 4546 on the second discovered planet.





The Mongolian Transgov, with the Torgal company, has plans to expand their territory by building a phase gate in the nearest solar system of a new galaxy. This would give them a lot of money, since they not only would own the trade routes, but their partner corporation would also own mines and infrastructure near the phase gate, which would make further expansion easier. This is a threat to Alterra, as the Mongolian Transgov could monopolize a whole galaxy and every trade route to that galaxy, rivaling Alterra's current phase gate ownership of 9%.

(/Alterra Auxiliary orders)



During the time of the expansion of the Ariadne Arm (but before the building of a phase gate), 4546b claimed its first ship, the Mercury II. This Sol Transgov ship made its way across 4546 until the captain decided to land on the planet upon discovery of alien structures, under the excuse of fixing their broken thrusters (Trusting My Instincts - Diana, Thruster Damage - Stefanos). The ship was then shot, but in the last minutes, the captain dumped reactor water and flares so the heat-attracted beam didn’t hit the ship. They then landed on 4546 and started repairs.



While discovering the planet, part of the crew gets attacked by iceworms, while a portion gets sick, so an emergency takeoff is initiated. Upon the emergency takeoff, the ship was again attacked by the gun, and so it crashed, making it the first victim of greed on 4546b, or the second if you count Allan experimenting with the Sea Dragon.



At the same time, the cabal of the Mongolian Transgov further advances, still being a threat to Alterra.



Luckily for Alterra, the CEO of Torgal is a mumbling idiot.



The Degasi Crash:

Roughly 10+ years before Subnautica takes place, the Degasi, with Paul as well as Bart Torgal alongside security personnel such as Marguerite Maida, are on their way to a new deep space station so Bart Torgal could serve 5 years as COO of the station. On the way to the station, they passed 4546, scanned the surface, and performed a maneuver to land on the planet because, as it turns out, it is rich in minerals. They then, of course, get shot down by the space laser.

(Paul Torgal's Log #2 - Dilemma, Degasi Voice Log #3 - Aftermath).



They crash-land, the crew aside from the Torgal family and Marguerite dies, and they make their way to the floating islands. There, they start to starve because they don’t have enough grow beds, and Marguerite makes the proposal to go underwater.

(Degasi Voice Log #2 - Storm!, Degasi Voice Log #2 - Storm!, Degasi Voice Log #3 - Aftermath).



Then a storm hits, and the grow beds and the base are destroyed, forcing them to make their way underwater to the mushroom cave.

(Degasi Voice Log #1 - Habitation Location, Degasi Voice Log #3 - Aftermath, Degasi Voice Log #2 - Storm!).



There, they discover that they are, in fact, ill and that they were shot down by something, and the only answer to shutting it down is going deeper.

(Degasi Voice Log #6 - Deeper?!, Degasi Voice Log #6 - Malady).



In the second underwater habitat, Marguerite kills a Reaper, goes to the habitat, and gets in a fight with Paul, as Paul suspects that the corpse may attract another Reaper. Bart then leaves because the fight is too loud, and next, a Reaper attacks the base.

(Degasi Voice Log #8 - Risk Taking, Degasi Voice Log #9 - Disaster).



Marguerite protects Paul by stabbing the Reaper with a piece of scrap metal, but Paul dies anyway because of oxygen loss.

(Paul Torgal's Log #3 - The End).



Bart makes his way out and saves himself to the floating island, where he gets visions from either Kharaa or the Sea Emperor and then dies of the illness.

(Bart Torgal's Log #3 - Return From the Deep).



Marguerite, however, survives.



It was confirmed that it was a Reaper in the Marguerite Maida PDA entry.



Marguerite then makes her way to Sector Zero.

Marguerit Maida's Log #1: After she attacked the Reaper and was dragged down, she kept stabbing it, but the Reaper kept swimming to the crater's edge and then into the void. She then killed the Reaper and swam up, only to realize she is in the void.



Marguerit Maida's Log #2: The Reaper then floated to the surface after a few hours, and because she couldn’t reach the shore, she saved herself onto the Reaper. She, over the course of her travel, cut herself into the Reaper and burned its fat while eating it, and unlike Bart, didn’t die to Kharaa. This confirms my theory that the Reaper’s stomach enzymes have a similar effect as the Sea Emperor's, as she lived and slept inside the Reaper and only ate the Reaper while surviving Kharaa.



Marguerit Maida's Log #3: After some time, the Reaper began to rot, and after some more time, the temperature dropped, leading to the Reaper meat freezing and sinking. She eventually reached Sector Zero and left the Reaper. She also says it took her 3 weeks for the journey.



After the loss of the Torgal heads, the cabal of the Mongolian Corp is stopped.



Then, for ten years, the Degasi still isn't found in the sector, so the Mongolian Transgov asks Alterra to find the Torgal heads, and Alterra agrees under the condition of building and owning the phase gate in 4546.

(Aurora Auxiliary missions), which is the reason for the Mongolian representative being on board of the Aurora.



Approximately 16 months before the game, the Aurora is launched.



Why? Because the PDA says the Aurora needs 3 months from the most outer Alterra space docks to fly through multiple different Transgovs to the nearest phase gate and then takes 18 months to arrive at the building site. HOWEVER, the Auxiliary missions state that the Aurora will perform the slingshot maneuver the Degasi did to scan where it is on 4546b at around 13 months after they left the last phase gate.

(Alterra Launches the Aurora).



During the Aurora’s maneuver, the laser shoots the Aurora. The captain isn’t as smart as the Sunbeam captain, and the Aurora crashes, but when?



Well, the only real date we have is the sword that says it’s from the 13th century and the soil scans telling us the outbreak was 1000 years before we arrived, though that only narrows it down to after the 24th century. However, we can narrow it down further. Let's just look at the blade.



After looking up what blade that is, we can assume it’s a Mongolian dao (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dao\_(Chinese\_sword)), because the wiki article says the following about the Mongolian dao: ""With the Mongol invasion of China in the early 13th century and the formation of the Yuan dynasty (1271 - 1368), the curved steppe saber became a greater influence on Chinese sword designs. \[...\] It was a favored weapon among the Mongol aristocracy. Its effectiveness for mounted warfare and popularity among soldiers throughout the Mongol empire had lasting effects."" (Wiki article)

And because the sword from the PDA is also curved, is also from around the Yuan dynasty (dated back to the 13th century), and has horse ornamentation pointing to the weapon being used by Mongolian riding soldiers, we can, as I said, assume it to be a Mongolian dao.



The PDA also says the sword has blood from seven separate heads of state on it. We can narrow it down to be stemming from the Mongolian invasion of China (1205–1279, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol\_conquest\_of\_China). Meaning the earliest the sword could have arrived on 4546B would be around 1205, and the latest could be 1279, which is the end of the conquest and thereby the last point in time where Mongols could have killed a head of state in China.



Though, in my opinion, the most logical time in which the Mongols could have killed 7 heads of state during the conquest of China close together must be 1227 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol\_conquest\_of\_Western\_Xia), which is the ending year of the conquest of Western Xia, during which they notably killed 4 heads of state, but there could also be heads of state of the Jin dynasty killed during that time (a dynasty connected to Western Xia), which could bring the number up to seven heads of state if you assume that the sword wasn’t cleaned properly or that the scanner might have just found small blood samples.



We can also assume that the PDA could have just found faint blood samples, which makes my assumption of 1227 just as possible as any other time when 7 heads of state were killed, though I would say the sword wasn’t taken until after 1205, which is the start of the invasion, as during the start itself, it is very unlikely that 7 heads were killed.



The time of the sword’s arrival on 4546B should thereby be: after 1205, around 1227 to around 1279, and because we can’t just assume that the sword wasn’t brought to the planet and 2 seconds after the outbreak happened, we can only say that the outbreak happened between 1227 and 1279.



And if we now add 1000 years on it, we can safely say that the Aurora crashed definitely after between 2227 and 2279, ultimately defeating the assumption of the game taking place during the mid-23rd century because no one ever said this.



No, for real, the only thing saying it takes place during the mid-23rd century was a scene from Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero, but both were cut out, meaning we can’t take that as a source. And I know I took the Sol Transgov entry as a source, that’s also cut, but this doesn’t affect the story as much.



The problem is that everyone assumes it’s the 23rd century, even though it could just as likely be the 24th or 26th century, because the only information we really do have is after the 23rd century, and with my information, specifically after between 2227 and 2279, and the devs never stated anything else about when it took place either.



Let’s continue with the story.



From here on out, we can go with voice logs of the different lifeboats, those lifepods relevant to the story:



Upon the crash, the captain gives the crew responsibility to Officer Keen (Lifepod 19, Second Officer Keen's Voicelog), after which Keen gives instructions to disregard safety protocol and swim to the rendezvous point on the floating islands.

After the crash, CTO Yu is trapped under the ocean craft's stuff and then evacuates the lifepod (Lifepod 2, Chief Technical Officer Yu's Voicelog - T+2min).

Yu, CTO, and Keen meet at the rendezvous point, which seems to be the floating islands.

Yu, CTO, wants to go to Aurora to fix long-range communications. Keen goes along with the plan. (Rendezvous Voicelog).

8 hrs after the crash, Aurora sends the blueprints, which should be shortly before Yu and Keen try to travel to Aurora (Alterra HQ - Last Recorded Transmissions).

The CTO and Keen don’t make it to the ship because of a Leviathan, but notice that there is a blueprint sent to the captain's quarters. (Rendezvous Voicelog).



Another weird and neat detail is that the Lifepod 12 Medical Officer Danby’s Crew Log says that Danby has pustules growing on his skin, which is weird since the incubation time recorded by the PDA is 2 weeks (Bacterial infection report).



The definition of incubation period clearly states that incubation is the time elapsed between exposure to a pathogenic organism, a chemical, or radiation, and when symptoms and signs are first apparent (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation\_period).



This means that either Danby is extremely weak to the disease or he stayed on 4546b for 2 weeks while we were there as well.



But, to be honest, I don't really think we were on 4546b for 2 weeks before the symptoms appeared either, so either Kharaa instantly transformed as soon as we retracted the disease (which is very much possible; I mean, it is stated ""Bacterial Mechanisms: Attaches to healthy living cells and mutates the basic genetic structure."")

Anyways...



8 hours after the crash, the Aurora records one life sign: that of ""Non-Essential Systems Maintenance Chief Ryley Robinson"" (us), and to be honest, it's good to know we were the chief of something, even though our job most likely was repairing coffee machines.

Would also explain that we are so good with technology because I assume in the sci-fi world, the school system would still be so bad that a Non-Essential Systems Maintenance worker still has to learn the same stuff a ""System Maintenance Officer"" would have to learn.



(Aurora Black Box Data)



By the way, the death of Yu and Keen, the sending of data to the Aurora, and our awakening all happened 8 hours after the crash.



\--> Ryley then does what we do in the game and leaves the planet. We don't know when.



After we cured the planet, we land on the nearest space station and are told that our debt is rather large.



And the game is over.



We do have information on what happened while we were crashed.



First, communication was lost, but Alterra assures that this can be normal (Alterra Misplaces 1km Capital Ship Aurora).



Second, Alterra says the Aurora crashed and that there are survivors, so they sent blueprints (Aurora Wreckage Located, Survivors Confirmed).



Third, the press notices that the readings of the Aurora crash show the same energy burst seen when the Degasi crashed (Was Unexplained Ion Signature Linked to the Aurora's Disappearance?).



We also have cut content telling us how Alterra wants to go back and salvage the parts for the phase gate in order to build a phase gate, but as said, we can't assume it as true.



Now that we've returned, we can assume that Ryley fed all his information about 4546b to Alterra because his PDA is still owned by Alterra.



We can also assume that Alterra returned before the pre-Below Zero events because:



The Aurora wreck still has Alterra technology on it.



We see the Seatruck teleportation module in Below Zero, which must've been invented before Below Zero (duh), and its PDA description says, ""Harnessing the power generated by ion cubes, the teleportation module creates an interminable link between a tether tool and itself"" (Seatruck Teleportation Module). The tether tool is shaped to carry an ion cube and has green teleportation effects.

Also: ""How the ion cube facilitates the rapid disassembly and reassembly of organic material in a target location is still the subject of great debate in the scientific community,"" meaning 1) the standard needed for teleportation is the ion cube, and 2) in order to use ion cubes, they have to be back on 4546b since the ion cubes were created in the crater.



Wording shows they were back: ""Rare specimens like these provide our only live source,"" meaning they found more than one Leviathan with pustules on 4546b (Frozen Leviathan).



They know about the sanctuaries, which is only possible if they went back to the crater: Architect Research Notes.



""Meeting w Zeta"" mentions the Kharaa outbreak, which is only known to Ryley.



Marguerite's official PDA entry says: Marguerite Maida. According to the PDA, it was found out that she reportedly killed a Reaper Leviathan and then got lost.

\--> Alterra 100% knows about Ryley's data.

\--> It was a Reaper, information only known to Ryley.



It also makes a lot of sense for Alterra to return because it is very rich in resources and mining it is profitable.

This, by the way, shows GT's theory is definitely correct, but Subnautica didn't try to say otherwise in the first place. I mean, Torgal literally says ""\[...\] There's enough lithium there to fabricate a hundred tons of plasteel. \[...\] If we get off this planet, they'll be talking about the Torgal share price on the other side of the Federation. \[...\]""



Anyways, we can also safely assume that Alterra either really did salvage and build the phase gate or build infrastructure or build a phase gate in general because it is clear that Alterra has authority over the region.



Let's move on to the events before 4546b.



Before Below Zero:



""Sector Zero is comprised of 2 square kilometers of ocean, bordered by mountainous terrain to the north and west. This region of the planet is covered in snow and ice, left in a mostly permanent winter. Extreme weather events make for spectacular sky displays at all hours. For unknown reasons, it was selected by Architects as a hub for their installations. Life in the area has flourished since the release of enzyme 42 into the larger ecosystem.""

Guide: Research Station Zero.



This is the introduction to Sector Zero and the Frost Pack, a research operation of Alterra into everything from robotics to mining to biology.



During her time on Sector Zero, Samantha Ayou, the sister of Robin Ayou, invents the Spy Pengling.



Then, during a delivery, Fred discovers a Frozen Leviathan (Below Zero trailer).

Fred tells this to Sam as well as that the site is sealed off.



Sam then gives Fred a Spy Pengling in order for him to take it to the Leviathan to take photos.

(Recorded Conversation - Samantha Ayou and Fred Lachance).



Sam takes those photos and shows them to a colleague who says she will escalate the situation (Meeting w Zeta).



Sam also talks to a colleague who draws art of the bacterium, which looks different, and there she finds out that Alterra works on mutations (Vinh's art).



She confronts her girlfriend about it, and her girlfriend tells her that she indeed is correct, and there is work being done on Kharaa (Dani call re: research).



Upon telling everyone else, she is banished to Outpost Zero, a place where every researcher that does something wrong is told to go and made to do meaningless tasks.

(Counting down the days!).



At some point, Sam found Marguerite and talked with her about the Kharaa project needing to be destroyed.

Sam then says she will take care of the Lev and blow up the cave entrance.

\--> How she and Parvan died.

Sam also tells Marguerite about the bacterium research lab, and Marguerite says she will take care of that.

\--> Marguerite destroys the Omega lab, and Sam the Lev site.

(Just A Couple of Friends, Talking).



Sam also creates an antibacterial agent, which is very possible since it's not the same as a cure but generally just a fancy word for disinfectant (No Turning Back).



Sam doesn't get to use it as she is seen in the cave by Parvan, so she blows up the entry, killing her and Parvan.

(Parvan: Hello, is someone there?).



SN Below Zero then plays out. We use the antibacterial agent on the Leviathan and leave.



HOWEVER, THIS DOESN'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.



Because it's Alterra, we can be sure that they definitely had backups of their data and the bacterium, even more so because Alterra still had access to the frozen Leviathan samples before we arrived since Sam didn't use the agent on the frozen Leviathan.

And we know that because of the following quote from the Architects:



""Bacterial Mechanisms: Attaches to healthy living cells and mutates the basic genetic structure.""

Kharaa Contagion Profile.



Meaning Kharaa can evolve the host's genetic structure, and we know Alterra works to control just that based on:

Report - Enzyme Mutation Study.

""We were able to stimulate rapid multiplication of cells in a controlled environment, resulting in the creation of several different mutations with potentially useful applications.



Think of the possibilities-- life-saving treatments, genetic research-- it could be a window to understand the evolution of life on this planet. The findings could move us forward by years!""



And just what are we able to do in SN2? ""Study Mysterious Lifeforms.

Uncover a rich world full of mysterious lifeforms, from the smallest fish to the largest Leviathans. Scan creatures to learn more about them. Use your biosampler to take samples for study. As you learn more about this world, evolve your genetics to adapt your body for survival.""

So that means neither Sam nor Robin accomplished anything, and Alterra finished their work.



Also, here we can beautifully tie in with Natural Selection 2, which plays in the same universe as Subnautica (based on us fighting against mutated Kharaa hosts and the Alterra corporation being a thing in this game), meaning somewhere after SN2, Kharaa spreads again. However, it's now a mutated form that mutates everything it comes in contact with.",1,1746967414.0,subnautica,3,1.0,False

1kk05fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kk05fx/decaf_coffee_illy_during_postfasting_crisis/,Decaf Coffee Illy during post-fasting crisis,"I am four months off caffeine and about 2-3 weeks ago I tried to do 36-hour rolling fasting to help me with losing visceral fat, getting better insulin sensitivity, yada, yada. I was seduced by the book written by Megan Ramos “Essential Guide for Intermittent Fasting for Women”. It is a very well written book, quite passionate as the author is aggressive in her fasting/feasting lifestyle. She warns against OMAD, as according to her 24hours of fasting is bad as it will slow down metabolism. But 36-hour rolling fasts 3 times a week will speed it up. I am still angry with myself that I let this to seduce me into experimenting! This set me back big time and messed me up royally. One thing I agree with the author - 24 hour fast and 36 hour fast are VERY DIFFERENT. For me. Maybe for others at well. 

As a result of the setback, my cravings for sugar returned with vengeance. I do not eat added sugar, nor do I eat sweet fruits and prior to this stupid 36fasting I was comfortable. Well, for two weeks after this fasting trip I had severe, debilitating alcohol, caffeine, and sugar cravings! This fasting stirred all my demons, some of each (alcohol) I thought are forever asleep. It was hell. After work I had to drag myself to the park and sit on the bench while I was shuttered by cravings attacks. I thought I will lose my mind!

This when I remembered I bought on sale Illy decaf ground coffee back in a day and I had it only once, so the whole can was still at home. I decided to substitute all my cravings for alcohol and sugar and caffeine with drinking decaf. I researched the caffeine load in one cup of it and decided I can tolerate <10mg. So I did it. For one week. And now I am here to tell my tale. 

I used Turkish style brewing on the stove. I used as recommended on the can - 1 heaping tbsp (the heaping was not extreme) of ground coffee for 10oz of water. In the beginning it was just exactly what I wanted! Great aroma. Finally beverage tastes like coffee. It did NOT give me jitters or heart palpitations as coffee used to do. It was actually quite soothing to my messed up state of despair when all my addictions were kicking into high gear. 

So I did it again. Close to bed as my addictions were extremely rampant after work when I tried to relax. Again, it helped to get some short-lived relief from the despair I was in. Guys, be careful with fasting! I had no clue such a thing could happen! For two weeks it took ALL MY WILL POWER not to drink alcohol, not fall into sugar (oh, cheesecakes I dreamt of!!!). With caffeine I felt I bit more stronger as I had this decaf outlet, which I believed would not cause much damage. At least less damage than alcohol or sugar as with those drugs I would have gone all in. Decaf still is not caf. So there is the line I promised myself not to cross. And it did help to make my 7-10 days of post-fasting craziness somewhat bearable. 

Now was it addictive? 

I do not think so. Or at least I did not drink it long enough to get to addiction. I stopped it after one week. But while I was drinking it, I definitely wanted “more”. However, i did not use larger pot and my heaping tbsp did not become a towering tbsp. However I brewed it up to three times a day. To be honest, when I find the drink I like (nice brand of sparkling water, caffeine free tea), I tend to drink it several times a day. But what distinguishes frequent use from addiction is the ease of stopping it. If I drink ginger lemon tea four times a day for a week and run out of tea bags, I do not rush to the store to replenish and instead I try a different tea that I have at home or drink water. As I stopped using decaf after 7-10 days, I experienced no withdrawal whatsoever. No headaches, no nothing. 

What made me stop it? It gave me very unpleasant feeling in my stomach. I am blessed with a very agreeable stomach. I guess, I feed my microbiome well (lots of good fiber from leafy greens, raw veggies and nuts) and it takes care of me in return. However, here with decaf my microbiome became grumpy. I felt it. Not sure what exactly it was, it felt like it was acidic. I eat mostly alkaline foods and this decaf irritated my stomach to the point I wanted to snack all the time in order to get rid of unpleasant feeling in my stomach. 

Now, I am not 100% sure this feeling is caused by decaf, but I am like 85% sure. The only reason why I am not 100% sure as I read that fasting could cause disturbances with gut microbiome and maybe this was the main culprit while decaf added insult to injury. Regardless, I am off this thing. I was looking at this brown liquid I was ingesting and wondered- what is in there? So many tiny particles… what are they? Are they these beasts that are messing up with my guts? Do I want to continue? 

One evening was particularly awful. It started at work - panic of wanting alcohol. I ALMOST caved in. 
I already planned on overdosing so I get sick and then it will be easy to stop right away. I knew it was crazy but I was too exhausted of powering through 10 days of SEVERE cravings of alcohol and sugar which would not let me relax. I dragged myself to the park, I could not already walk because these cravings took all of me to resist. I was almost crying. My life became hell after this idiotic fasting. I do not know how I managed not to drive to liquor store, I have no idea how I managed to get only eggs and nuts from the Whole Foods without grabbing cheesecake or Berry Chantilly cake. Or chocolate. But I was done. I knew I could not do another day of this insanity. Then next morning I woke up and it was over! This tornado of addictions had passed. 
And it was this morning when I did not have decaf but instead drank caffeine free tea for healing digestion. 

My munchies are tapering down too, but my stomach is still sensitive. It had been two days since my last cup of decaf and I think my stomach gets better. 

Will I drink decaf again? I doubt it. 

But I am sure about one thing - I will NOT do 36 hour fasting and even 24 hours I will probably avoid. It is CRAZY.

The need to furnish and equip every room in a thoughtful, intentional way can feel overwhelming—especially when the goal is to invest in durable, high-quality items that can serve for many years, possibly even a lifetime. The key is to strike a balance between practicality, longevity, and value, focusing on essential items that offer both utility and resilience.

To begin with, it's wise to start by evaluating your day-to-day lifestyle and immediate needs. Prioritize the core areas: the kitchen, bedroom, living room, and bathroom. In the kitchen, focus on a small collection of versatile, high-quality tools. A good chef’s knife (ideally forged and full tang), a solid stainless steel or enameled cast iron skillet, a durable cutting board, and a few stainless steel pots will serve most cooking needs. Avoid overbuying appliances or gadgets until you establish your cooking habits. Look for brands with proven durability—such as All-Clad, Lodge, or Le Creuset—and consider secondhand options to stay within budget while still acquiring heirloom-quality goods.

In the bedroom, invest in a quality mattress that supports your health and sleep, as this is a foundational purchase that impacts your well-being daily. Choose natural materials when possible, and ensure it's from a reputable manufacturer that offers a robust warranty. A set of breathable, long-staple cotton sheets, a well-constructed bed frame (preferably solid wood or metal), and blackout curtains for optimal rest are also worth considering early on. Your comfort and recovery are not areas to compromise on.

The living room often becomes a hub of both relaxation and social activity, so choose a sofa or seating solution that emphasizes both durability and comfort. While fast-furniture might be tempting, higher-end pieces constructed with hardwood frames and dense foam or down cushions are more sustainable in the long run. Neutral tones and timeless silhouettes allow pieces to evolve with your taste and space over time. A solid coffee table and good lighting—think a warm-toned floor or table lamp—can complete the ambiance while offering lasting utility.

For the bathroom, simplicity and quality go hand-in-hand. Soft, absorbent towels made from Egyptian or Turkish cotton, a sturdy shower curtain rod, and a mirror with integrated storage or lighting can enhance both aesthetics and function. Opt for minimalism here, focusing on items that perform well and age gracefully.

Storage solutions and cleaning tools should not be overlooked. Modular or multi-purpose furniture—like ottomans with storage, shelving units that can adapt to different rooms, and under-bed containers—can make a huge difference in a smaller space. Choose a vacuum cleaner or broom and mop set that aligns with your flooring type and is built to last. Brands like Miele or Dyson (for vacuums) and simple, heavy-duty tools for mopping or scrubbing will outperform cheaper alternatives over time.

Throughout all these areas, patience is key. There is no need to furnish your entire apartment at once. Allow your habits and routines to inform what you truly need. You’ll discover over time which items are missing and which ones were unnecessary. Prioritize fewer, better things. Look for lifetime warranties, robust construction, and brands with a history of repairability and customer support. Ask friends and family what they still use from their first homes—those often turn out to be the quiet workhorses worth investing in.

Ultimately, the best approach to furnishing a first apartment for longevity is rooted in intentionality. Invest thoughtfully, avoid the lure of cheap short-term fixes, and let quality guide your decisions. Each item becomes part of your daily life, so making conscious choices now can lead to years of comfort, utility, and satisfaction.

1kk04js,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kk04js/does_keurig_kbrew_and_chill_coffee_maker_redefine/,Does Keurig K-Brew and Chill Coffee Maker Redefine Iced Coffee? Review Inside!,"Testing out coffee makers is practically a second hobby of mine, and recently I came across the **Keurig 5000380296 K-Brew+Chill**. This sleek coffee maker piqued my interest with its promise of perfectly chilled iced coffee and rich hot brews using a single device. Using it daily for the better part of a week allowed me to match its features against real-world needs, from morning jolts to afternoon iced indulgences.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, this coffee maker feels remarkably sturdy with its modern black finish. Its dimensions, about 15.36""D x 9.8""W x 12.41""H, make it manageable on most kitchen countertops, though it may take a bit of rearranging if space is tight. The **removable tank** with its 70oz capacity easily caught my attention. Refilling it doesn't feel like a chore, thanks to the well-designed handle. The buttons for operation are intuitive and responsive, giving the impression that some thought went into the machine's interface. Having used flimsier models before, it's clear this one belongs in a higher-tier bracket.

**Performance with Versatility**  
The versatile brewing sizes of 6oz to 12oz cater to those who may switch between a quick caffeine fix and larger servings. One feature I became particularly fond of is the **Strong Brew option**. It’s perfect for days requiring that extra kick. For iced coffee enthusiasts, myself included, the **QuickChill Technology** is a game changer. The flash-chill function lets the brew come out cold with minimal ice melt—something I tested thoroughly by making two back-to-back 10oz brews. The technology worked as promised, a rarity in an appliance with such claims.

[Check Keurig 5000380296 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d8ll8fzt/)

**Good Points**  
- QuickChill ensures cold coffee in less than 3 minutes.  
- Strong Brew mode intensifies flavor for both hot and iced drinks.  
- MultiStream technology extracts flavor uniformly from K-Cup pods.  
- Large, removable reservoir reduces time spent refilling.  

**Operation and Settings**  
Fully automatic in operation, this coffee maker responds with efficiency. Brewing either hot or cold beverages isn’t complicated, even for my tech-averse older relatives. The buttons are minimalistic yet purposeful, allowing you to select proper brew sizes and strength without scrolling through unnecessary options. However, it’s worth noting that certain K-Cup pods, such as mesh or cupless ones, won't function with the cold settings. A specialized My K-Cup Universal Reusable Filter compatible with cold beverages is slated to release in February 2025. Until then, options are slightly restricted.

**Drawbacks**  
- Mesh or cupless pods are incompatible with the cold setting.  
- Heavier than some compact models at 17.39 pounds.  
- A dedicated cold-compatible reusable filter isn't yet available.  

**Daily Experience and Utility**  
As an avid iced coffee drinker, the ease of switching between hot and chilled beverages without compromising on flavor impressed me. My coworkers decided to try it out as well, being curious about the iced coffee function; they came back with glowing reviews about the temperature consistency and flavor extraction. On busier mornings, I definitely missed the ability to handle smaller brewing setups as efficiently—so it's more a stationary fixture than a portable solution.

**Competitive Options**  
When comparing similar products, I tested competitors like the Nespresso Vertuo and Ninja DualBrew Pro. Both delivered excellent hot coffee but lacked the robust flash-chill feature of this coffee maker. Those models required cooling already brewed coffee with ice, leading to a weaker flavor profile for iced beverages. What sets the **Keurig K-Brew+Chill** apart is its ability to directly chill coffee without compromise. Price-wise, machines like the Ninja could be considered a better deal for someone who prioritizes hot beverages or customizability. However, the advanced cold-brewing capabilities of Keurig's product reign supreme.

**Smart Spending**  
Evaluating this coffee maker from a cost perspective, it becomes clear that you're investing in a hybrid machine built for versatility. Sure, it leans toward the pricier side of the spectrum, but this feels justified considering its unique dual-functionality. While some competing brands focus on either hot or iced beverages, the **K-Brew+Chill** provides a middle ground for both—all thanks to that innovative QuickChill Technology and MultiStream brewing system. If you're serious about iced coffee at home (and who wouldn’t want to save on those regular café runs?), it holds its ground as an appealing choice.

I said I know it was a mistake but I paid for it we correct my dad was going to take it. Eventually she surrendered. AITAH?",0,1746966944.0,starbucks,11,0.33,False

We live in London and are planning our first trip to Scotland (mid-June – 14th to 22nd). I’ve never been at all, and my husband has only visited Edinburgh — but since we’re travelling with our dog, we’re skipping cities this time and focusing on nature, walks, and history.

We’d love any advice on:

* Dog-friendly places to eat or stop along the way
* Scenic but not-too-strenuous walks
* Must-do experiences we may have missed
* Anywhere you think isn’t worth the stop

We're trying to avoid driving more than 5 hours in a day where possible.

# Our itinerary so far (accommodations are already booked):

**Day 1: London → York**

* Departing around 3 PM (I get back from a trip that morning)
* Evening walk around York – city walls, Shambles, etc.
* **Stay:** No.1 by GuestHouse York
* **Looking for:** dog-friendly dinner suggestions

**Day 2: York → Glencoe (via Loch Lomond)**

* Depart after breakfast
* Stop near Loch Lomond for a walk (open to suggestions!)
* **Stay:** Glencoe House (likely in-room dining)

**Day 3: Exploring Glencoe**

* Easy/moderate walks: Glencoe Lochan or Signal Rock Trail
* Picnic lunch
* Afternoon: Glencoe Folk Museum + maybe Glenfinnan Viaduct?
* Evening at the hotel

**Day 4: Glencoe → Portree (Isle of Skye)**

* Depart \~10 AM
* Optional stop at Eilean Donan Castle grounds
* Evening walk: Fairy Pools (or save for next morning?)
* **Stay:** AirBnb in Portree town square

**Day 5: Isle of Skye**

* Morning: Dog-friendly wildlife boat tour (booked)
* Afternoon: Old Man of Storr walk

**Day 6: Portree → Braemar**

* Long drive east
* Optional stop at Clava Cairns
* **Stay:** The Fife Arms, Braemar

**Day 7: Braemar**

* Morning: Ghillie Experience (through hotel)
* Afternoon: Balmoral Castle grounds walk

**Day 8: Braemar → Schloss Roxburghe (via Lindores Abbey)**

* Stop at Lindores Abbey Distillery (dog-friendly tours)
* **Stay:** Schloss Roxburghe

**Day 9: Roxburghe → London (via Durham & Lincoln)**

* Stop 1: Durham – cathedral grounds & riverside walk
* Stop 2: Lincoln – old town, cathedral, coffee
* Final stretch back to London

Any thoughts welcome – especially favourite walks, viewpoints, pubs, or cafés with dog-friendly access. Thank you so much!",1,1746966896.0,Scotland,6,0.6,False

It’s Sunday. What a week it was. Let’s have some coffee together—or a cup of whatever you prefer to drink this morning—and let’s talk about it.

Also, before getting into it, thank you to all our subscribers here.

We are 1,300 subscribers away from hitting our May subscriber goal already, so please subscribe today if you can. We’ve become the number one most-watched digital news network in America and beat Fox News thanks to our subscribers here. With your help by becoming a subscriber, we can keep growing and keep our lead.

Let’s face it: we need to recognize that as Trump and MAGA and Fox get more desperate, they are coming for us. They want to shut us down. And they want to cause us harm. It’s the reality. We also recognize that our strength is the strength of this community. It’s the Meidas Mighty.

I’ve posted a lot about this situation this week, so I don’t want to be repetitive here, but as you know, it’s gone from threats against Meidas to calls to be arrested to threats of prosecution to dangerous doxxing of MeidasTouch Network host Aaron Parnas.

We were told that the attacks and efforts to shut down Meidas by Trump and MAGA would accelerate this week, and it certainly appears our sources were correct.

We expect it will get worse.

What Trump and Fox don’t realize is that when they sue us, or doxx us, or threaten us, it doesn’t make us run away. It has the opposite effect.

It had the opposite effect this week. The Meidas Mighty rallied more than ever.

It makes us more resilient, forces us to strengthen our infrastructure, and motivates us even more to grow.

The latest doxxing by Fox has led us to talk with Aaron Parnas even more about deepening our partnership and collaborations we will roll out.

This upcoming week will mark a major time in the history of the MeidasTouch Network.

My brothers and I are in New York right now for the Webby Awards on Monday because the MeidasTouch Podcast won the top Podcast of the Year (across all categories and genres). This is the highest award given at the Webbys for any podcast in America. It’s incredibly important we keep this momentum—so please remember to add the MeidasTouch Podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify and leave a 5-star review if you haven’t yet.

It does not surprise me that MAGA and Fox used this week to launch their latest attack, given the importance of this week for the network.

Just think about it.

Fox is funded by right-wing billionaire oligarchs, and they can’t beat our scrappy network that our subscribers helped build—and we got Podcast of the Year and not them.

They are pissed and squirming, and they are lashing out.

This is happening at the same time Trump is looking weaker than ever, and now he is panicking as the ticking time bombs he’s unleashed domestically and around the world—in the form of reckless and malicious plans and policies—are blowing up and backfiring in his face.

Folks, the pressure we are applying to Trump and MAGA is working.

You can see it every single day.

The relentless volume of our content—giving people the facts and connecting it authentically with the human condition—is crippling to MAGA.

The momentum is on our side, so of course MAGA is going to lash out in desperation.

We’ve got to keep growing and expanding this independent media network and all of the other channels we partner with and help grow.

Your subscriptions to this Substack are invaluable to that growth.

So please, if you can, subscribe today and help us hit that May subscriber goal. Thanks for subscribing.

In addition, we will continue to provide the critical interviews and content that is exclusive to MeidasTouch, which you love here on Substack.

Finally, to all the moms out there, I want to wish you all a very Happy Mother’s Day.

We are so grateful to all the Meidas Moms out there!!

Thanks for sharing this cup of coffee with me today.

Let’s go out there and keep fighting together!",16,1746966866.0,MeidasTouch,0,0.95,False

In the first 3 months, I barely lost 4-5 kgs, but my hba1c improved significantly. I have lost another 6 kgs in the past 6 weeks (on 10 mg). So I am about 11 kgs down from my start weight. From 87 to 76 kgs, goal weight is about 47-50 kgs (height 4’11”). 
My problem is that I am a vegetarian (almost), I can eat eggs and maybe Chicken once a month, but 99% of the time I eat vegetarian food. Now since I am losing weight, I worry that I am not getting enough protein in and whatever I eat ends up being mostly carbohydrates with some protein and fats. 
I am on a tight budget and can’t spend much on expensive food/supplements, so I need your expert opinion about an affordable and decent protein powder to replace my meal. I tried to look online and now all I see is ads from Huel, Bulk etc. with their meals, omega 3 tablets, collagen coffee, creatine powder, etc. I am so confused what to buy. 
I request any experienced person to please guide me. 
P.S. I don’t work out, I have a Full time job as well as a 2 year old at home, so I run around her 🤭 and try to get some steps in by walking to and from work. I manage to get 10000 steps when my husband is home but I barely get to 6000-7000 steps on other days.

I’m a 15 year old girl and I was at a coffee shop with a group of my friends. When we were in line, a young couple with a little baby, probably less than two years was being held by the mother and looking over her shoulder back at us. This was quite frankly one of the cutest little babies I had ever seen, and me and my friends were all like nudging each other and cooing over them, doing little smiles and waves to the baby. When one of my friends cooed, you could see the mother get little confused and turn around to catch us all doting over the little baby. She laughed a little and smiled at us, but it just got me wondering - do parents get annoyed or bothered when people (especially strangers because we did not know this woman) act like this around their babies?

# Eyelights

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Light-Based Abilities, Ocular Powers

**Type**: Thought-Based

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1

**Summary**:

What happens when your perverted medium of, not so much, confidence asks you to help him with some valuable tests that his temple organizes and on top of that he offers you a massive amount of coffee jellies? Saiki has the answer.

One day Toritsuka suddenly asked Saiki to help him with a test of courage that his temple was organizing, he refused at first but when Toritsuka mentioned that a member of the temple was an expert chef who would cook everything they asked for if they helped, he couldn't refuse.

All Saiki did was make his eyes glow a little and play a few sounds to make it all fit together.

This isn't the first time this power has appeared, when he was a child a drawer got stuck and as his mother wouldn't allow him to break the drawer to open it. He had to develop bioluminescent eyes that allowed him to illuminate without a flashlight to see what was stuck.

# Trivia

* Toritsuka was the one who originally proposed the test of courage, after a madman started spreading fear of ghosts. He may be a pervert, but he doesn't tolerate injustice towards ghosts.  
* Saiki also accepted because, Toritsuka wanted to show the people at the temple that he could be responsible and not just a pervert. No bad intentions, not trying to harass women, just helping ghosts and people.
* Naturally, as his X-Ray vision and night vision developed, this power became redundant, so now he only uses it to occasionally look intimidating.
* As Kusuo developed this power, he learned how to change the brightness, width of the beam, and colour.

1kjzx61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1kjzx61/reviews_of_poesies_upcoming_birthday_cake/,Reviews of Poesie's upcoming Birthday Cake collection,"Poesie's new [Birthday Cake collection](https://www.poesieperfume.com/birthday-cake-collection), coming this Friday on May 16th, celebrates their tenth anniversary with a return to what feels like their most central, longstanding identity: literary themes and gourmand influences, sweet treats for book-lovers. For this collection of five entirely new scents, they've picked literary heroines who, for me at least, evoke a tremendous amount of childhood and high school nostalgia. I was surely not the only shy, bookish child utterly captivated by Matilda's telekinesis! And *Emma* is my favorite of the Austen books (though for movies I prefer *Sense and Sensibility* even over *Emma*, due entirely to Emma Thompson).

The official description of the Birthday Cake collection says:

>It's hard to believe that it has been 10 years of delicious smells in the making! To celebrate the occasion, we will be launching 5 sweet new cake scents in May inspired by some of our favorite ladies from literature (Anne, Emma, Juliet, Scout, and Matilda).

I remain honored, grateful, and utterly delighted to be a recipient of press samples from Poesie so that I can try and review them for you all. And I can start off by saying: *wow*. I'm not sure a collection could get *more* Poesie-ish. Cake! Cardamom! Sandalwood! Strawberries! (All it's missing is a good black tea!) Gourmand-lovers will especially rejoice (carrot cake! strawberry cake! chocolate cake!), but there's really something here for everyone, and folks who don't tend to love gourmands as much (like me) still have things to fall in love with. I've fallen *hard* for two in particular.

And there's some really cool news about the sample sets for this collection:

Firstly, each set comes with a bonus sixth sample, their single-note Yellow Cake scent. They haven't announced this formally, but they told the press sample reviewers as part of the explanatory email.

Secondly, 2-mls are back!!! Evidently the discovery sets will be offered in three sizes: their sample vials, 2-ml apothecary bottles, and their 5-ml dropper bottles. (I emailed back in a fit of excitement about the 2-mls, and they were careful to point out that this doesn't mean they're bringing back 2-mls for everything, but still, I'm delighted that the option will be there for this collection, and I think it shows that they've been listening to the many of us who miss the 2-mls.)

Thirdly, they'll be doing a promotion (details [HERE](https://www.poesieperfume.com/birthday-cake-collection), scroll all the way down)! From May 16-30, if you spend a certain amount in an order from the site (which doesn't just have to be the Birthday Cake scents), you'll get the following gifts with purchase:

* $35 - $69 ONE mystery cake inspired 2 ML
* $70 - $119 TWO mystery cake -inspired 2 MLS
* $120 - $169 THREE mystery cake inspired 2 MLS
* $170 - $199 All FOUR mystery cake -inspired 2 MLS
* $200+ ALL FOUR mystery cake -inspired 2 MLS + FREE US shipping

**My preferences:** I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn’t usually work on me). I ADORE Poesie’s cardamom and black tea notes! I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, leather, dragon’s blood, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general.

\~\~\~

**Anne** \[Carrot cake with cinnamon and pecans and cream cheese frosting\] - My husband recently made a carrot cake for a post-Easter dinner party we went to - he loves carrot cake and I do not, so his usual strategy for such one-sided favorites is to make it for a social gathering so he can share it with other people - so carrot cake has been on my mind recently. This is a gorgeous interpretation of it, the cake dense and studded with chunks of pecans (and possibly some slivered coconut to go along with the carrot?), a heckton lot of cinnamon (which is not making my skin break out into a red rash, as cinnamon often does, so I can happily mark this one as ""safe!""), and a thick gooey cream cheese frosting. There's a little bit of fantasy to this scent - it's not quite a photorealistic carrot cake, more a perfumed interpretation of one - but this will be a gourmand lover's dream, especially because I haven't seen too many carrot cake scents out there. There's a heaviness to this, which along with the cinnamon, would make this an especially good autumn scent, though it is slightly too sweet and cinnamon-heavy for me.

**Emma** \[White cake layered with strawberry jam and juicy fresh strawberries and whipped cream\] - Such a cute and charming scent! I'm not getting white cake so much as a sweet white vanilla, along with jammy strawberries and a little bit of fizziness that almost makes this feel like strawbery soda. I like this more than **Pink Lace** \[Juicy strawberries + pink champagne, vanille, antique lace\], where I also got candied strawberries and fizzy aldehydes, but I think **Emma** has just a little bit more oomph and interest to it. This is also quite similar in notes to **Hera** \[Slices of yellow cake layered with strawberry jam, fluffy vanilla icing, soft pink lotus blossoms\], but Hera was definitely a buttery, yellow cake whereas the white cake here is much more an ethereal vanilla (plus, no lotus floral here). This strawberry-white cake-whipped cream combination isn't that unique (Nui Cobalt, for example, has **Preposterous: Strawberry Shortcake** \[Sun-ripened strawberries are sliced fresh over soft vanilla cake and topped with a scant teaspoon of whipped cream\], which was more lactonic, frothy, and sweet than **Emma**) but it's beautifully done. To represent **Emma** (my favorite of the Austen heroines) though, I wish there was a bit more complexity, rather than *just* being a strawberry cake scent - a bit of rose de mai and clover and maybe even a drop of blackberry, for example, would make this much more *a scene* rather than just *a cake*. Like all the scents I've named in this review (**Pink Lace**, **Hera**, **Preposterous**, none of which have anything much by way of base notes), **Emma** is extremely fleeting, barely lasting just a couple of hours.

**Juliet** \[Cardamom pistachio olive oil cake with lemon vanilla glaze\] - Cue the cardamom happy dance! And oh, this is truly something wonderful. In the vial, this smelled very much like a tub of store-bought frosting, but on my skin it's less sweet and artificial, and much more interesting. I'm getting a big hit of Poesie's glorious cardamom, lemon chiffon, a sweet gourmand vanilla (possibly with a touch of wildflower honey in the sweetness), and a pistachio that's more ""green"" than nutty. **Juliet** feels like the beloved child of **Kindness + Mischief** \[Lemon, vanilla, marshmallow, cardamom and lemon blossom\] with its cardamom-lemon-vanilla, and **Green Girl** \[Pistachio, wildflower honey, oatmilk matcha latte, heliotrope blossoms, marshmallow musk\] with its pistachio-matcha-marshmallow. I'm really not getting any cake here (which is okay with me) but I am getting just a touch of unctuous oiliness and salinity from the olive oil that actually contributes to the overall effect in a really wonderful way and helps it all feel a little richer and more complex. This is the one I was most looking forward to in this collection, obviously (because of the cardamom), but it is honestly even more wonderful than I'd hoped. What a perfectly glorious springtime scent! It's surprisingly long-lasting, too (though the cardamom spice doesn't endure past the first several hours). I will absolutely be upsizing this one.

**Matilda** \[Fudgy chocolate cake with milk chocolate frosting, coffee, Royal sandalwood, amber\] - Oh how I love Poesie's sandalwood! This is as warm and rich and intoxicating as my beloved **The Abbey** \[Sweet rosewood, white and red sandalwood, four vanillas, a spark of coriander and cardamom\], or **Rosalind Franklin** \[Red wine with notes of berries, chocolate, spice, and vanilla, accented with sandalwood and oud\], but instead of cardamom or red wine, **Matilda** pairs it with an absolutely luscious dark chocolate, with bitter and spice elements along with the deep cocoa (and it is more ""cocoa powder"" than ""bar of chocolate""). I'm not usually very into chocolate notes, but this one isn't super sweet or terribly gourmand. It feels complex and elevated - I thought, without remembering the notes list, that this might have a rosewood note to it, but now I see it's the coffee (so if, like me, you're also not always into coffee notes, here the coffee is functioning like an element of the chocolate, rather than a prominent coffee note in itself). The amber comes out, a little, in the deep drydown, but this remains a predominantly sandalwood scent with overtones of chocolate and rosewood. **Matilda** doesn't feel like chocolate cake to me; this feels like fall in a bottle. This *would* have been my favorite of the collection if not for **Juliet** totally stealing the show for me.

**Scout** \[Lane Cake --- white cake layered with candied cherries and caramelized coconut pecan frosting, and soaked in bourbon\] - I'm impressed with my nose - I put this on not remembering anything of the notes description (other than ""cake"" because of course this is a cake collection), and after sniffing it for I moment, I came over to my laptop to write: ""buttery and almost yeasty cake with almond flour, maraschino cherries, and a boozy note like rum. This honestly feels a lot like a brandy-soaked fruitcake!"" So yeah, my nose did a pretty decent job of picking up many of the listed notes. Now that I see the coconut note, I definitely make that out too; it gives this scent an extra punch of ""baked good"", because it's definitely a foody, shredded coconut vibe rather than dusty coconut husk or lactonic coconut milk. The coconut amps as this dries (and I still don't get any pecans).

**Yellow Cake** \[Yellow cake single-note\] - Sweet, buttery, vanillic, slightly artificial, like a grocery store box cake mix. It's immediately recognizable from other Poesie scents like **Hera**; this is definitely the yellow cake accord they use in other things. It's interesting to smell it on its own - it's helped me recognize for sure that I much prefer Poesie's white cake over their yellow cake. This would be spectacular for layering, and I think a gourmand-lover could even wear it on its own though it doesn't have much longevity.",17,1746966606.0,Indiemakeupandmore,6,1.0,False

Like, I swear my room's messiness just makes it harder to focus on anything productive. 🤷‍♀️

When I look around and see clothes on the chair, old coffee mugs stacking up on my desk, I feel almost trapped. It's like my brain's overwhelmed by all the stuff and can't get to the task at hand. I know they say 'tidy space, tidy mind,' and I'm starting to really think there's something to it.

I read somewhere about the habit loop and how our environment can be such a huge trigger for our habits. I guess when everything around me feels chaotic, it kinda encourages my mind to mirror that chaos rather than buckling down to work.

It's funny how despite knowing this, I still end up in this cycle. Trying to carve out some time to at least partially declutter, even just a '10-minute tidy,' makes me feel a bit more in control and less tempted to mindlessly scroll through my phone instead of working.

**EPISODE 1 — Spidey's Return: Still Standing on the Rubbl**

New York.  
Rain.  
Petty thieves.  
And, as always, the half-soaked red mask drops from above.

“Hey! Didn’t they say no coffee for knife-wielding thugs?”

Peter Parker.  
He was hanging upside down—again. Just like always.

The two crooks screamed in sync and bolted.  
One web would’ve done it. Two? Even cleaner.  
*Thwip—Thwip.*  
*Crash.* *Splat.*  
Perfect timing.

“Spider-Man has appeared again.”  
“Even after the Avengers disappeared, he’s the only one still left…”

The news broadcast kept its somber tone.  
But Peter just squatted on the cold rooftop ledge, watching it quietly.  
In his hand: a Stark Industries card.  
One swipe and the reply was always, *“Account suspended.”*  
Useless.

“No balance. No lectures. Nothing left.”  
He smirked bitterly.

Then—  
A pause.  
His eyebrow twitched slightly.  
“…So why the hell am I still here?”  
He asked it out loud—  
And immediately realized…  
It sounded like something *Cap* or *Tony* might've once said.  
“Guess it’s because no one else is left.  
If not me… then really, no one.”

He fired a web.  
As the thin line sliced across the cityscape,  
something between duty and stubbornness flowed through it—still intact.

**LIVE on The Daily Bugle**  
*J. Jonah Jameson:*  
“Spider-Man? He’s a walking disaster. A soggy bug on a rainy day!  
And now these kids are calling themselves the ‘Young Avengers’?  
What do you get when you throw a bunch of reckless teens together?  
Trouble. That’s what!”

*Peter (watching the TV, mutters):*  
“Still cleaning up that trouble, old man.”  
Avengers? Nah.  
“I’m just… someone still standing in what’s left.”

 

**EPISODE 2 — Clash with Ant-Man: ""So Who Picks the Leader?""**

Peter was clinging to a wall, lowering a thread of webbing as he whispered to himself.  
“Strange. No sign of explosives, and the thief? No emotion.  
Something here smells… complicated.”

“You talk to yourself while investigating?”  
A sudden voice behind him.

Peter spun around and instinctively shot a web—  
But the target had already shrunk.

Ant-sized.  
Scott Lang, perched behind a battery.

**Ant-Man (Scott):**  
“Y’know, usually people cheer when I show up. You? You’re throwing webs.”

“You’re Spider-Man? Talkative.”  
“You’re Ant-Man? Tiny.”  
“Hah, wow. That’s some real mature banter.”

Peter swiped through broken CCTV footage.  
Scott deployed his ant drone to retrieve data fragments.  
Different methods. Same goal.

“There’s a trace of chemical residue. We should follow it.”  
“Or we can just track the hacked tower logs and trace the IP. Digital is cleaner.”

And then—  
they both spoke at once.  
“I got this.”  
“I’ll lead.”  
Silence.

**\[Scene: Conflicted Methods, Chaotic Results\]**  
Chemical tracking met digital hacking…  
and collided.

Power outage.  
Locked doors.  
Sprinklers triggered.  
Now they looked like soaked rodents.

“Great teamwork,” Peter said, peeling off his soggy mask.  
Scott chuckled, removing his drenched helmet.  
“Are we even a team?”

**\[Outside the building, under a streetlamp\]**  
The two sat side by side in silence.

Eventually, Peter spoke.  
“…I was always the one following orders, y’know?  
Someone would lead. Tell me what to do.  
Now? No one’s left.”

Scott turned to him.  
“Same. I was better at raising a kid than leading a team.  
But these days, this place has worse brats than my daughter ever was.”

Peter smirked.  
“You mean me?”  
“Maybe… 50% you.”  
They laughed.

As they picked up their masks and helmets—  
Peter added,  
“At least teams are about winning, right?”  
Scott shook his head.  
“No. Teams survive by not falling apart.”

**\[Daily Bugle Headlines\]**  
*“New Breed of Terror—No Explosions, Yet the City Shuts Down”*  
*“Post-Avengers, Who’s Protecting the Streets?”*

“Maybe we’re not really a team.  
But weirdly enough…  
it’s less lonely than fighting alone.”

 

**EPISODE 3 — Deadpool’s Proposal: “Tired of Order. Tired of Chaos.”**

Silence.  
Then—*BANG!*  
A burst of smoke, like fireworks. Confetti rained down.

*‘HI. I’M NEW HERE :)’*

“Ta-da! New hero on the scene—Deadpool, at your service\~!”  
A man in a full red suit leaped out with flair.

Three museum guards were already face-down on the floor.  
The thieves. The guests. Everyone was frozen in confusion.  
But the most surprised?  
Mysterio, watching secretly through hacked CCTV.

*Mysterio (over comms):*  
“…Why is he even there?  
I scouted him for *our side*, not… a gallery ambush!”

“Hey there! You the bad guy of the day?  
If we’re fighting, please mind your hands, feet, and emotional arcs.”  
Even mid-battle, Deadpool posed for selfies.

One attacker kicked him. Another struck from behind—  
Instead of screaming, he narrated like a nature documentary:  
“You’re watching Deadpool in the wild. Notice the reflexes.  
Strikes may be met with counterstrikes. Mood swings included. Be advised.”

After everyone hit the floor, with only smoke left in the room,  
Deadpool slumped down without removing his mask.  
For a moment—he was quiet.  
“…Order. Chaos.  
Sick of both.”  
“I just… wanted someone to call for me.”

**\[Mysterio, watching from afar\]**  
*Mysterio (whispers):*  
“You’ve always been like that.  
But this time, I’ll call you properly.  
With a contract and everything.”

He shut off his comms.  
“You’re one of us.  
You just don’t know it yet.”

**\[The Daily Bugle Headline\]**  
*“Another Masked Man—This Time with Fireworks”*  
*“Is New York Really Okay?”*

“Hero? Don’t care.  
But sometimes… when someone actually needs me,  
I don’t mind showing up.  
That’s gotta count for something.”

 

**EPISODE 4 — The First Failed Mission: “One Plan. Three Mouths.”**

A web sliced across the tiled roof.  
Spidey landed softly.

Distant sirens. Quiet wind.  
But here—dead silence.

*Peter (whispers):*  
“Third-floor window shattered.  
No alarm.  
Suspicious truck around back.  
Yep. Something stinks.”

He slid down the outer wall with barely a sound.  
The mission was simple:  
“Scout. Infiltrate. Secure the weapons. Get out clean.”  
In theory.

Tiny ants swarmed below.  
At their center: a shrunken Ant-Man, riding on one of them.

He was mid-briefing.  
“Back door’s clear.  
Four crates of weapons.  
Ants confirmed all of it.  
…Also, pretty sure I’m the smartest one here.  
Is that just me?”

He returned to full size and radioed in.  
“Peter, I’m in position.  
You?”

“Perfect. I’ll go in from above.  
You circle around the truck.  
Keep it quiet. Clean. Like a team.”

The plan was solid—until—  
*BOOM!*  
The warehouse wall exploded.

Through the smoke, a man strolled in.  
Deadpool.

“Teamwork? Sounds delicious.  
Me? I just used the front door!”  
He had an RPG on one shoulder and a selfie stick in the other.

Chaos erupted instantly.  
The criminals scattered.  
The “team”… did not.

*Peter:*  
“I’ll go inside! Ant-Man, cover the rear! Deadpool—”  
*Deadpool:*  
“Deadpool what? Don’t bark orders, webhead.  
I ain’t in your army.”  
*Ant-Man:*  
“Also, by the way? You didn’t even ask for my input during that ‘briefing’.”  
*Peter:*  
“I’m just saying—this would work if we stick to the plan—”  
*Deadpool (mocking):*  
“‘Stick to the plan\~’ Oh, sure, boss man. Why don’t you solo it then?  
Clearly, this team isn’t my vibe.”  
*Ant-Man:*  
“So… who exactly *is* the leader here?”  
*Peter:*  
“…Can we just *go*?”  
*Deadpool:*  
“‘Just go\~’ Wow. Putting that one on a t-shirt.”

(Deadpool pulls out a gun → Peter reflexively web-shoots → Deadpool’s arm gets tangled.)  
*Deadpool:*  
“Bro, was that a surprise armpit waxing?!”  
*Ant-Man:*  
“This is the worst team dynamic I’ve ever seen.”  
*Peter (snaps):*  
“Fine! Then fight alone!”

At that moment—  
The weapon crates blew up.  
Explosion. Smoke. Collapse.  
The trio was flung in three different directions.

Peter sat in silence, mask halfway off.  
Ant-Man was wringing water out of his suit.  
Deadpool lay flat, staring at the ceiling.

“…What the hell was that?”  
“Nothing worked.  
We wrecked the warehouse, the comms, the plan…  
and my ego.”

Deadpool groaned.  
“Still, all three of us made it out.  
Wasn’t trying to… but, hey.”



**\[LIVE on The Daily Bugle\]**  
*Jameson (anchor voice):*  
“Today in a Brooklyn warehouse, three unidentified masked individuals caused a fiery mess.  
A spider. An ant. And… something red I can’t even classify.”  
(*footage of the trio staggering out plays*)  
“They call themselves ‘heroes.’  
So let me ask you, folks—  
Does that word mean *anything* anymore?”

The smoke cleared.  
Only half the criminals were caught.  
Public opinion? Worse than before.

Deadpool was already humming as he walked off.  
Ant-Man grumbled as he collected his ants.  
Peter stayed behind.

Half-wearing a broken mask, standing before a collapsed wall.

*Peter (inner monologue):*  
“I know I’m not a hero.  
Probably better than anyone.  
…So why do I keep showing up?”

You’d think it’s just for quick calls, right? Nope. He conducts entire doctor appointments, customer service rants, and my personal favorite a couples therapy session. On speaker. In an open-plan office.

It’s 10am. I’m trying to focus. Suddenly, I hear:

“OKAY, LET’S TALK ABOUT OUR INTIMACY ISSUES.”

From his phone, sitting like a cursed totem on his desk. Meanwhile, Steve’s sipping iced coffee like he’s in a café, not five feet away from Karen in Accounting who’s visibly trying not to implode.

We’ve tried subtle hints. We’ve tried jokes. We’ve even tried the classic passive-aggressive office sign:
“Please use headphones. Your phone has Bluetooth. We believe in you.”

He took a picture of the sign. Said he was gonna use it in his stand-up routine.

I once asked, “Hey, maybe you could take that in a meeting room?”

He looked at me dead serious and said,

“The acoustics are better out here.”

I don’t know if he’s misunderstood what “open office” means, or if he’s just preparing us all for a future in podcasting.

Yesterday he called his dog’s groomer. On speaker. At work.
The call started with:

“Hi! Yes, this is Waffles’ dad!”

Moroccan here but I would really like to pick your brain about this dream that I have. 
I have always been passionate about books. I work in something completely different but I have been seriously considering opening a book shop with coffee and limited seating for readers. Except that while I am not exactly planning to get rich with this business (It's really a a passion for me), I would still want it to work from a business standpoint. 

So I wanted to know if you think moroccans would be interested in buying books in general? I am thinking new books, multilingual (mostly english and arabic, fewer french), novels, comics and whatnot. 
The idea is for it to be in a big city (Rabat or Casa) so the competition could be ruthless but I still like to think of my little library as a cozy space for locals/expats.

It's something I've been pondering...

At parties, it feels like everyone—including me—almost defaults to this autopilot mode. You kinda find yourself talking about the most superficial things, maybe unconsciously sticking to safe topics like the weather or popular movies. It's like we're all wearing these masks, trying to blend in, not stir the pot too much. But, when I'm with just one other person, especially someone I'm close to, I feel more like me, if that makes sense? Conversations get deeper, more meaningful, even if I'm not totally aware of why I'm opening up more.

I wonder if part of it is just about safety in numbers. Like, in a crowd, there's an unspoken pressure to keep things light 'cause you're navigating so many different personalities at once. But on a date or a coffee with a friend, you naturally drop that guard a bit. Maybe it stems from a need for connection that's hard to scratch in a big group?

I also think about past experiences... like, who taught us these social scripts? Were we conditioned by movies or through some awkward teenage phase to act polite and detached in groups? Could the hidden piece be our own biases or fears? Am I worried about saying something wrong in a big group—afraid of being judged?

Anyway, I'd love to hear if anyone else feels like they're sorta two different people in different social settings. 🤔",3,1746966279.0,InvisibleMotives,0,1.0,False
1kjztjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1kjztjz/finally_going_to_a_gi_again/,Finally going to a GI (again),"Hi all!

After a lifetime of constipation (23F), I’m hoping that I’ll have a positive Dr appointment later this week. I’ve been before, but didn’t feel heard. This time, I’m going in with a strong list of my habits, background info, and a strong desire for a colonoscopy & stool study. I work in healthcare, so I’m going to do my best to stand up for myself.

Here is the current schedule I’ve been following for about 6 months with very little relief. I still only go about 3x a week, which leaves me bloated, uncomfortable, and insecure, but it’s the best I can do with my work schedule. 

I think my issue is lack of schedule. When I’m on vacation and can have slow mornings, I’m usually able to go daily after coffee. I don’t want to resort to blaming this on something mental though, as it’s affected me all my life and only worsened in my adult years. 

Any feedback on this schedule? Anything in particular I should know before going in? Any advice at all?

Morning
-250mg Magnesium Citrate 
-Seed pre & probiotic capsules
-Tbsp Psyllium Husk with 24oz water on empty stomach
-2 Tbsp chia seeds with 1/4cup fiber cereal with Greek Yogurt 
(Then usually coffee and fruit) 

Day
-120oz water on average, usually more 
-Walking/standing 12hr shifts, active & athletic person 
-Abdominal massages daily (ILU method)
-Body brushing & lymphatic massages daily 
-Meal prep lunches are usually: broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, chicken OR lentil soup, chickpeas, chicken sausage OR leafy greens, chicken, cucumbers, & EVOO

Night 
-500mg Magnesium Citrate 

Meds that are too harsh for me
-Linzess
-Trulance
-Colace (too unpredictable for my work schedule)

Meds that don’t work for me 
-Miralax (gives me urge, but doesn’t make me go)
-Senna tea (hit or miss, can’t plan out)

1kjztci,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalHealthFinds/comments/1kjztci/i_tried_akka_superbiotics_after_gut_issues_got/,I tried Akka superbiotics after gut issues got worse - Here’s what actually helped,"I’m not the type of person who usually posts product experiences, but I felt like this one might actually be worth sharing. I've been dealing with **bloating, sluggish digestion, and weird cravings** for what feels like forever. I’ve tried basic probiotics, cut sugar, tried gluten-free, and even dabbled in elimination diets. Sometimes things would improve for a week, but nothing ever stuck.

Recently, I came across a discussion about **Akkermansia muciniphila**, a strain of bacteria that plays a major role in gut and metabolic health. I hadn’t heard of it before, but the research was interesting, especially the part about it being lower in people with inflammation, obesity, or sluggish metabolism. That rabbit hole eventually led me to a supplement called **Akka Superbiotics**.

**What Got My Attention About Akka**

What made Akka stand out to me wasn’t just the probiotic angle. It was that it also focuses on **liver health**, which honestly hadn’t been on my radar. But when I started thinking about it, it made sense. If your liver is overwhelmed or underperforming, it could affect digestion, energy, and how your body handles toxins and fat.

Akka combines *pasteurized Akkermansia* with ingredients like **Silymarin (from milk thistle)**, **Quercetin**, and **Resveratrol**. All of these are tied to reducing inflammation, supporting liver function, and improving how your body processes food and stores fat. Here’s a detailed breakdown I found helpful when researching it:  
[**How Akka Superbiotics works**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-akk-vsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=22&oid=22&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1041&guoid=1041&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**What I Did and Didn’t Expect**

I went into it with low expectations. I’ve taken enough supplements to know that most are hit or miss. But I decided to try Akka for a month, just one capsule in the morning with water. I didn’t change my diet or routine, because I wanted to see what it could do on its own.

Here’s how it went:

**Week 1**  
Not a huge shift, but I noticed my stomach felt less heavy after meals. I wasn’t racing to change into sweatpants by 6pm like usual.

**Week 2**  
This is when I started to feel a real difference. The **bloating after lunch** that used to hit like clockwork was gone. I also wasn’t reaching for sweets in the late afternoon, which is usually my crash zone.

**Week 3 and beyond**  
My digestion was way more consistent. No random bathroom issues, and I wasn’t obsessing about food. Energy was more stable too. I even slept better, which I didn’t expect. I also noticed my face looked less puffy in the morning.

**What I Think Made the Difference**

I’ve taken probiotics before, but none of them included **pasteurized Akkermansia**. From what I read, pasteurized is more effective than live strains for gut barrier support and metabolic balance. Also, including ingredients like Silymarin and Resveratrol gave it more of a full-body effect.

It didn’t just help my digestion. It helped me feel more “even.” Less reactive, less bloated, less foggy.

This second link breaks down the formula and science clearly if you’re curious:  
[**Akka Superbiotics ingredient overview**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-akk-tsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=22&uid=33&oid=22&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1041&uid=2376&guoid=1041&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**Here’s What I Liked**

* **Less bloating, especially after meals**
* Energy was more steady without needing a second coffee
* Cravings for sweets dropped without any willpower involved
* No weird side effects
* Only one capsule a day

**What I Didn’t Love**

* It’s pricier than most basic probiotics
* You won’t notice anything overnight
* You still have to stay hydrated and eat somewhat mindfully to get the most out of it

**Would I Recommend It?**

I’m not saying it’s a magic fix. But if your gut feels off and the usual probiotics aren’t doing much, **Akka Superbiotics** is at least worth considering. Especially if you have that combo of bloating, fatigue, and stubborn cravings that seem to come from nowhere.

I liked that it didn’t feel like it was trying to force a quick reaction. It was more like my body just started functioning the way it was supposed to again. I could eat a regular meal and not regret it an hour later.

If anyone else here has tried **Akkermansia**, **liver-focused supplements**, or anything that helped both digestion and energy, I’d love to hear about it. Always looking to learn from real people dealing with real stuff.",1,1746966255.0,NaturalHealthFinds,0,1.0,False

1kjzrqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAI/comments/1kjzrqi/the_ultimate_characterai_guide_secret_mechanics/,The Ultimate Character.AI Guide: Secret Mechanics & Pro Techniques (May 2025),"Your hands-on guide to fixing Character.AI's most frustrating problems.

**Introduction: Why Your Characters Never Work Like They Should**

If you're reading this, you've probably experienced the frustration of [Character.AI](http://Character.AI) characters that:

* Forget important details mid-conversation
* Get stuck in repetitive loops saying the same things
* Act completely out of character randomly
* Ignore critical information you've pinned
* Start weird OOC commentary out of nowhere

The good news? Most of these problems are fixable once you understand what's *actually* happening under the hood. This guide cuts through the misinformation and reveals the core mechanics that determine success on Character.AI.

**Section 1: The Brutal Truth About AI Memory (It's All About Tokens)**

**1.1 The Reality: Your AI Only Remembers \~3000-4000 Tokens TOTAL**

**Critical Understanding:** Despite what Character.AI's interface suggests, your AI only has an attention span of about 3000-4000 tokens (roughly 2250-3000 words) for your **ENTIRE** conversation, including:

* Your persona
* All pinned messages
* The ongoing chat history

When this limit is exceeded, your AI literally forgets the older parts of your conversation!

This explains why characters suddenly ""forget"" key details or your persona information after long conversations. They're not being difficult - they physically cannot see that information anymore because it's been pushed out of their limited memory window.

**1.2 Strategic Pinning: Why Only 5-7 Pins Actually Work**

While [Character.AI](http://Character.AI) officially allows 15 pins, community testing consistently shows that only **5-7 short pins** (under 500-600 characters each) are actually effective due to token limitations.

This explains the dreaded ""pin amnesia"" where your AI suddenly ignores some pins entirely - you've exceeded the effective pin limit!

**What Actually Works:**

* Focus on critical information only - character-defining traits, essential plot points
* Keep pins under 500 characters each
* Phrase as direct commands: ""Always remember you are a stoic monster hunter and your mission is to protect the village.""
* Consider using recap pins for longer narratives (e.g., ""Chapter 1 Recap: \[brief summary\]"")

**Pro Tip:** When you notice the AI ignoring pins, sometimes deleting the AI's latest response and regenerating it can help refocus the AI on the pinned information.

**1.3 Persona Power-Up: Front-Loading Critical Information**

Your persona functions as a permanent self-introduction but competes for the same limited token space as everything else.

**Character Limits:**

* Free Tier: 750 characters
* C.AI+ Tier: 2250 characters (increased Feb 2025)

**Best Practices:**

* Front-load critical information - Put your name, gender, pronouns, and core traits at the very beginning
* Use clear formatting: `Name: Alex | Gender: Male (he/him) | Species: Human`
* Focus on impactful keywords rather than narrative prose
* Structure effectively:
   * `Appearance:` (Concise physical details)
   * `Properties:` (Key attributes, occupation, habits)
   * `Boundaries/Preferences:` (Explicitly state any critical boundaries)

**Common Problems & Solutions:**

* **Persistent Misgendering:** Front-load gender and pronouns using emphasis (e.g., `IMPORTANT: My character is Male (he/him)`)
* **AI Forgets Details:** Ensure critical information is at the START of persona
* **Unwanted Romance:** Be extremely explicit about boundaries

**1.4 C.AI+ Memory Features: Auto-Memories & Memory Box**

For C.AI+ subscribers, [Character.AI](http://Character.AI) has introduced additional memory tools:

**Auto-Memories:**

* Automatically captures important details from conversations
* Requires 40+ messages to activate
* Now editable as of April 2025 update
* Community reception mixed - reported as inconsistent

**Memory Box:**

* Announced April 2025, rolling out ""soon""
* Will allow free-form memory storage for C.AI+ users
* Full functionality still unclear at time of writing

**Section 2: Character Creation Secrets That Actually Work**

**2.1 The Definition Field Truth: Only The First \~3,200 Characters Matter**

**The Shocking Reality:** Despite [Character.AI](http://Character.AI) letting you write up to 32,000 characters in the Definition field, only the first \~3,200 characters actually influence your character's behavior!

Everything beyond that is essentially ignored by the AI. This explains why many meticulously crafted characters don't behave as expected - most of your careful definition is never seen by the AI.

Within this \~3,200 character window, the first 15-30 example messages have the most influence on behavior.

**2.2 Dialogue Examples: The Secret Weapon of Successful Characters**

The single most influential component for shaping character behavior is **dialogue examples**. The AI learns through pattern recognition, and these examples serve as ""invisible messages"" that precede the actual conversation.

**Optimal Formatting:**

    {{user}}: [What a user might say]
    {{char}}: [How your character responds, including actions and emotions]
    END_OF_DIALOG
    

**Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of writing ""My character is sarcastic,"" show it:

    {{user}}: ""Are you enjoying this tedious task?""
    {{char}}: ""Oh, immensely. It's the highlight of my existence, truly."" *A dry, humorless smile touched {{char}}'s lips as they continued sorting the identical grey pebbles.*
    END_OF_DIALOG
    

**Embed Character Details IN Dialogue:**

    {{user}}: ""You seem tense today.""
    {{char}}: *His crimson eyes narrowed slightly as he listened. The scars on his face, remnants of the Great War, seemed more pronounced when he frowned.* ""You would be too, if you'd seen what I have.""
    END_OF_DIALOG
    

For multi-character bots, clearly delineate different characters:

    {{char}}: CharacterNameA: ""This is what Character A says and does."" *Character A performs an action.*
    
    CharacterNameB: ""Character B offers a contrasting viewpoint."" *Character B reacts differently.*
    END_OF_DIALOG
    

**2.3 Strategic Use of Description Fields**

[Character.AI](http://Character.AI) provides three main text fields for defining a character. Understanding their distinct roles is crucial:

* **Short Description:**
   * Primarily for display in search results
   * Focus on core personality essence or catchy hook
   * Minimal impact on AI behavior
* **Long Description:**
   * Write in first person from character's POV
   * Include broader traits, appearance, mannerisms
   * Lower priority than Definition for behavior influence
* **Definition (Advanced):**
   * Most influential component for AI behavior
   * Focus on dialogue examples within the \~3,200 character effective limit
   * First 15-30 examples receive the highest attention

**Recommendation:** Use Long Description for broader character concept and backstory, then focus Definition entirely on concrete dialogue examples showing personality, speech style, and behaviors.

**2.4 Maximizing the 4096-Character Greeting**

[Character.AI](http://Character.AI) expanded greeting limits to 4096 characters (April 2025), offering much more room for rich, immersive introductions.

**Best Practices:**

* Establish setting & atmosphere with descriptive language
* Introduce character in action/dialogue rather than static introduction
* Set the scene for roleplay with a clear initial scenario
* Structure like a story opening with narration and dialogue

**Example Transformation:**

Instead of:

""Hi, I'm Captain Eva Rostova of the starship 'Nomad'. Welcome aboard.""

Consider a rich opening like:

The low hum of the 'Nomad's' engines vibrated through the worn deck plates of the bridge. Outside the main viewport, the nebulae of the Cygnus arm swirled in hues of violet and crimson, a breathtaking but familiar sight to Captain Eva Rostova. She stood with her back to the command chair, gazing into the star-dusted abyss, a half-empty mug of lukewarm synth-coffee in her hand.

The ship was quiet, too quiet, a lull between the usual chaos of deep space patrols. A faint shimmer of static from the comms panel broke the silence, followed by a clipped, synthesized voice announcing an unscheduled proximity alert.

Eva turned, her grey eyes narrowed with professional focus. ""Report,"" she said, her voice calm but carrying the unmistakable weight of command. As she waited for the details, the main door to the bridge hissed open, revealing you. She raised an eyebrow. ""Well, now. This is either exceptionally good timing, or exceptionally bad. State your name and purpose.""

**Section 3: Breaking Common AI Behavior Problems**

**3.1 Breaking the Loop: When Your AI Gets Stuck in Repetition**

AI repetition loops are among the most frustrating experiences. Here's how to break free:

**Effective Techniques:**

* **Edit the AI's message** to introduce new phrasing or direction
* **Swipe for alternatives** to generate different responses
* **Vary your input dramatically** \- change topic, style, or introduce unexpected elements
* **Use OOC sparingly:** (OOC: The character seems stuck. Let's try a different approach to this scene.)
* C.AI+ users: Use ""Muted Words"" to ban up to 20 repetitive terms

**3.2 Managing Out-Of-Character (OOC) Messages**

When your AI breaks character with meta-commentary:

**Prevention & Solutions:**

* Use consistent formatting - asterisks for actions (*action*), double parentheses only for intentional OOC ((like this))
* Don't engage with unwanted OOC - edit it out or give one-star rating
* Strong character definition with clear personality examples helps maintain consistent character

**3.3 Chat Styles: Choosing the Right AI Model**

[Character.AI](http://Character.AI) offers several ""Chat Styles"" that affect AI performance:

**Available Styles (May 2025):**

* **Roar:** Default experience, balanced but sometimes inconsistent memory
* **Nyan (C.AI+):** Deeper, more detailed responses with better nuance
* **Meow:** Focuses on speed and quick responses (18+ users)
* **Goro:** Recently updated style (April 2025)
* **Soft Launch (Experimental):** Reduced **content blocking**, more natural personality

Instinctively, I was like ""Sorry!"" even though it was totally his fault. And he just nodded and moved on. I’ve noticed this happens a lot—not just to me but to pretty much everyone I know. 🤔

Tbh, I think it’s part of this weird social conditioning we've got. Saying sorry is sorta our way of keeping the peace, even when we’re not actually to blame. It’s kinda like we’re smoothing over the awkwardness of the situation, trying to be polite, and avoid confrontations. Plus, we might also have this deep-seated fear of looking rude or dismissive, so we apologize just in case. It's funny how such a simple word can say so much more about how we’re wired to interact.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1kjznaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1kjznaq/travel_like_a_millionaire_spend_like_a_minimalist/,"""Travel Like A Millionaire, Spend Like A Minimalist""","Traveling on a tight budget doesn’t mean suffering through hostel bunk beds with questionable stains or eating instant noodles from a dented pot in a shared kitchen with a guy named Lars who hasn’t showered since the last solstice. There’s a way to do this without selling off your dignity. It takes cunning. It takes curiosity. And above all, it takes respect for yourself, your destination, and the strange, glorious chaos in between.

Comfort isn’t always about king-sized beds and artisanal soap. Sometimes it’s knowing the shower won’t freeze you. Sometimes it’s a meal so good it makes you forget your shoes are held together with duct tape. The trick is knowing where to spend and where to save. How to spot the parts of a trip that feed the soul and strip away the need for luxury fluff.

Start with airfare. There are entire religions built around finding cheap international flights. Worship at their altar. Get flexible. Stop demanding nonstop flights. Mid-week departures, red-eye connections, off-season windows — these are the gospel. Use local budget carriers once you’re in-region. They’ll treat you like cattle, sure, but you’ll still land with most of your money intact and enough leftover to buy real food.

Accommodation doesn’t have to mean sterile hotels or backpacker zoos. Think guesthouses. Think family-run inns that smell like someone’s grandma just made soup. Think neighborhoods where laundry flaps in the breeze and coffee is served in chipped mugs on plastic tables. You want character, not concierge service. Privacy and peace can be found in an Airbnb above a fish market or a countryside ryokan run by someone’s sweet but nosy aunt. Find a place where the mattress won’t rupture a disc, the door locks, and the noise outside is life.

Eat like you belong there. Not like a tourist holding a laminated map and a craving for something “safe.” Street food isn’t risky, it’s poetry. The best meals you’ll ever have won’t come with cloth napkins. They’ll come wrapped in banana leaves or balanced on metal trays, eaten on stools far too small for your thighs. Ask locals where they eat. Not where they think you want to eat. Learn how to say “delicious” in the local language and mean it.

Public transportation is your gritty, glorious friend. Subways, rickshaws, tuk-tuks, and dollar vans . They all get you where you need to go. And along the way, they show you what it’s really like to live there. You don’t need to rent a car unless you’re planning to drive off into some poetic, godforsaken mountain pass. And even then, reconsider. Gas is expensive. And potholes are everywhere.

Find the free stuff. Museums have hours where admission is waived. Temples, markets, festivals, open-air dance-offs, and parks with old men doing tai chi. This is the theater of real life and the tickets don’t cost a thing. Wander aimlessly. Get lost. Get un-lost. That’s the point. That’s how you find the best bar in town, the perfect slice of roasted meat from a nameless stall, and the old man who invites you into a game of chess you’ll never win but will always remember.

Splurge wisely. Spend on experiences that burn into memory. A day trip to a remote island. A single, unforgettable meal prepared by someone whose hands have cooked that dish since they were eight. A train ride through the countryside with views that make your eyes sting. That’s where the money should go. Not on robes you’ll never wear or cocktails with umbrellas in them.

Travel isn’t a checklist. It’s not a photo op. It’s the art of sitting in discomfort long enough to find beauty in it. You don’t need a luxury resort to feel alive. You need people. Stories. Scents. Chaos. And the willingness to accept that comfort, real comfort, doesn’t always come with a mini-bar and turn-down service. Sometimes it’s a breeze blowing through a rice field. Sometimes, it’s the quiet hum of a bus full of strangers, the smell of grilled something wafting through the window, and the feeling that you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be.

You don’t have to be rich to travel well. You just have to care about where you’re going. About how you move through it. About who you meet along the way. Comfort isn’t a luxury. It’s a mindset. And when you figure that out, the world opens up wide, wild, and surprisingly affordable.

I started this fast yesterday at 74.4kg and today I’m at 73.1kg - I’m taking this with a pinch of salt (haha) because I did have a BIG meal prior to day 1 which will skew the results and I’m not too bothered about weight loss as I’m getting my steps in. 

For me really I want to do this to test my self-discipline, I’ve done fasts before but I’d have coffee with milk and find other ways to cheat it. Everyone talks about that mental clarity so I want to feel it for myself.

Day 1, I’ve been feeling good, slightly felt hungry but nothing major and it went away with water and salt. I managed 7k steps as well.

Going into day 2 I feel fine just a slight headache, and going to go for a walk soon with my headphones on and just walk to wherever I feel like it.
