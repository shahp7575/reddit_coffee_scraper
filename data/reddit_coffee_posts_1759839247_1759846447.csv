1o0fv3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/1o0fv3s/i_helped_an_old_lady_walk_to_a_trash_can_and_her/,"I helped an old lady walk to a trash can and her car, how do I ""ghost"" her without being a bad person?","Yesterday I was having a coffee Playdate with a friend of mine and our 2 sons ""mine is 9 months hers is 15 months) and we were drinking our coffees outside. An older lady walks up and asked if one of us could help her walk to the trash can down the sidewalk, I immediately said yes and got up to help her. She explained she has bad knees and feet and about how she thinks she broke her back and had an appointment to get to and how she needs an apartment/aid, to which I stupidly mentioned the complex I live in saying rent was reasonable. After we threw her trash away, she asked me to help her to her car, which she then told me to look at how dirty it was and said she would pay me to clean it for her one day. She asked for my number, and me being me, didn't think anything of it and gave her my number and agreed- free money damn near. 

But I very quickly regretted it, she immediately called my phone twice, and I soon found out she can't text coherently due to bad hands so she has to call (mind you, I can barely understand her when she's talking) and told me about how my sons name had a beautiful biblical meaning (normal for old people to say, though I don't like it). She is now texting me about if I can walk down to town again to help her get around today, and essentially; she gives me really bad vibes, and don't get me wrong, I feel bad for her, I wish she had family to help her out (idk anything regarding that for her). If I wasn't a mom, I probably wouldn't think anything of this tbh, but I simply cannot help this stranger out while caring for my son, the idea of taking my focus off him while in public is extremely uncomfortable for obvious reasons. 

I have her messages snoozed, but I don't know if I should essentially ignore/ghost her. I'm hoping she forgets I exist and such, but yeah. I don't want to be an asshole, but I just dont want to be an aid to a complete stranger who I can't understand well. ",2,1759846255.0,ask,1,1.0,False

1o0fter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1o0fter/life_cycle_thinking_is_missing/,Life Cycle Thinking is Missing,"I find people don't think of the whole life cycle of a product when deciding if it is green. For example, dishwashers are ""green"" now because they use less water than hand washing. But they use electricity, and they have to be manufactured out of metal and other materials, shipped, and stored, all of which have environmental costs. 

Every unnecessary renovation of a home or office wastes materials and energy. I used to work for a government recycling office and the amount of waste produced by construction was extraordinary. A lot of that waste gets illegally dumped. Every time a building is torn down instead of renovated, every time you ""update"" your bathroom or kitchen, you are creating waste and using up materials.

I'm not saying that no new construction should happen, or that we shouldn't demolish buildings that can't be made useful or renovate kitchens that no longer function. Just that we shouldn't mindlessly welcome or quietly accept that it is normal and good to change things for the sake of change (or profit or fashion).

Finally, it makes sense to me to choose products that do not contain water whenever possible. This applies to foods like pasta and rice--the frozen versions that are already cooked are incredibly wasteful of energy and space. It applies to beverages, like coffee (beans are much more ""green"" than canned or bottled coffee drinks), and lots of cleaning supplies (laundry powder vs. liquid). When water is included in a product that could be dried, it adds volume, which increases the amount of packaging needed. It adds weight, which uses more fuel in transport. Both of those require more space in trucks, warehouses and stores. 

I wish life-cycle thinking was a part of everyday life decisions for more people.

# 🔹 What Is Diabetes, Really?

Diabetes (also called **Diabetes Mellitus**) is a long-term metabolic disorder in which your body either **doesn’t produce enough insulin** or **can’t use the insulin properly**.  
Insulin is the hormone responsible for converting sugar (glucose) in your blood into usable energy.

When this process fails, glucose stays in your bloodstream — causing **high blood sugar** levels. Over time, this can harm your eyes, kidneys, heart, and nerves if not controlled properly.

There are mainly **three types of diabetes**:

1. **Type 1 Diabetes** – When your body stops making insulin completely (usually genetic or autoimmune).
2. **Type 2 Diabetes** – When your body still makes insulin but doesn’t use it efficiently (most common type, lifestyle-related).
3. **Gestational Diabetes** – Develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after childbirth but increases future risk.

# 🔹 Why You Should Care — Even If You’re “Healthy”

Diabetes doesn’t happen overnight. It develops **slowly over years of poor diet, stress, lack of exercise, and unhealthy habits.**  
The scary part? Millions of people walk around with **prediabetes** and don’t even know it.

But the good news — you can **completely change your future** with small daily choices. Let’s dive into the most powerful tips 👇

# 🥦 1️⃣ Eat Smart — Balance Is Everything

Food is your body’s fuel, but for diabetics (or those at risk), **what you eat** directly controls your blood sugar.

# 🍽 Tips for Healthy Eating:

* **Start your day with water, not sugar.** Avoid sugary tea, coffee with added sugar, or fruit juice in the morning. A glass of warm water with lemon is better.
* **Follow the “½ + ¼ + ¼ plate rule”:**
   * ½ plate = non-starchy veggies (spinach, broccoli, cucumber, tomato)
   * ¼ plate = protein (fish, eggs, lentils, tofu, chicken)
   * ¼ plate = complex carbs (brown rice, oats, quinoa, whole wheat)
* **Avoid white killers:** white rice, white bread, white sugar.
* **Eat small, frequent meals** instead of 2–3 large ones.
* **Include fiber-rich foods** (beans, chia seeds, flaxseed) — they slow down sugar absorption.
* **Go easy on fruits:** prefer low-glycemic ones like apple, guava, papaya, or berries.
* **Stay hydrated:** water helps flush out excess sugar naturally.

>

# 🏃‍♂️ 2️⃣ Move Daily — Exercise Is a Natural Insulin Booster

Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity — meaning your body can use insulin more effectively.

# 🧘‍♀️ Ideal Activities:

* **30 minutes brisk walk daily** (the simplest and most powerful habit)
* **Light strength training** 2–3 times a week
* **Yoga or stretching** to reduce stress and improve blood flow
* **House chores or gardening** count too — just keep moving!

Even **10 minutes after meals** of light walking helps reduce blood sugar spikes.

>

# 🧠 3️⃣ Manage Stress — Because Stress Raises Sugar Too

When you’re stressed, your body releases **cortisol**, a hormone that increases blood sugar. Chronic stress makes diabetes worse.

# 🌿 Simple Stress-Control Habits:

* **Deep breathing** for 5 minutes, twice daily
* **Listen to calming music or nature sounds**
* **Stay connected with friends or family**
* **Practice gratitude journaling** (write 3 good things daily)
* **Meditation or prayer** — mental peace = better health

>

# 😴 4️⃣ Prioritize Sleep — It’s Not Lazy, It’s Healing

Lack of sleep makes your body resistant to insulin. Even one night of poor sleep can spike blood sugar.

# 💤 Sleep Hygiene Tips:

* Get **7–8 hours** of quality sleep.
* Maintain a fixed bedtime and wake-up time.
* Avoid screens at least **30 minutes before bed**.
* Keep your room cool, dark, and quiet.
* Avoid heavy dinner or caffeine at night.

>

# 🩸 5️⃣ Track Your Numbers — Knowledge Is Power

You can’t manage what you don’t measure.

# 📊 What to Monitor:

* **Fasting blood sugar:** 70–100 mg/dL (normal)
* **Post-meal sugar:** <140 mg/dL (normal)
* **HbA1c:** below 5.7% (shows your 3-month average)

If your numbers are rising, don’t panic — use them as motivation to act early.

Use a **glucometer** at home weekly if you’re at risk, and get a **doctor check-up every 6 months**.

# 💊 6️⃣ Medication and Supplements (If Needed)

If you’ve already been diagnosed, take your prescribed medicines regularly. Don’t skip doses or stop without medical advice.

# 🌱 Helpful Natural Supports:

* **Fenugreek seeds (methi)** soaked overnight can reduce sugar levels.
* **Bitter gourd (karela)** juice helps improve insulin sensitivity.
* **Cinnamon** may help regulate glucose — add ½ teaspoon daily to tea or oats.
* **Apple cider vinegar** before meals may lower blood sugar spikes.

⚠️ *These are supportive — not replacements for medical treatment.*

# 💧 7️⃣ Hydration: The Most Overlooked Habit

Water helps flush out excess glucose through urine and keeps your organs functioning properly.

# 💦 Tips:

* Aim for **2.5–3 liters** of water daily.
* Avoid sugary drinks, soda, and artificial juices.
* Coconut water (in moderation) is great for electrolytes.

Pro tip: If you’re thirsty often — that’s already a sign your sugar might be high!

# 🍵 8️⃣ Avoid Hidden Sugars

Sugar hides in so many foods — even “healthy-looking” ones.

# ⚠️ Watch out for:

* Breakfast cereals
* Sweetened yogurt
* Fruit juices and energy drinks
* Ketchup, sauces, and packaged snacks
* Coffee creamers

Always **read nutrition labels** — sugar might appear as fructose, sucrose, maltose, or corn syrup.

>

# ❤️ 9️⃣ Care for Your Heart, Too

Diabetes increases your risk of **heart attack and stroke**. Protecting your heart = protecting your life.

# ❤️ Heart-Friendly Habits:

* Avoid trans fats (deep-fried foods, margarine).
* Add healthy fats: olive oil, nuts, avocado, and fish.
* Maintain healthy weight (BMI < 25).
* Keep blood pressure and cholesterol in check.

>

# 👣 🔟 Take Care of Your Feet & Eyes

High blood sugar can damage nerves and blood vessels — especially in the feet and eyes.

# 👁 Foot & Eye Care:

* Wash and dry feet daily.
* Wear comfortable shoes.
* Check for cuts or blisters regularly.
* Get your eyes checked yearly.

>

# 🌈 11️⃣ Build Healthy Daily Routines

The secret isn’t doing everything perfectly — it’s doing the small things **consistently**.

# Daily Routine Example:

|Time|Habit|
|:-|:-|
|Morning|Drink water, light walk, healthy breakfast|
|Midday|Balanced lunch, short walk|
|Afternoon|Avoid sugary snacks, hydrate|
|Evening|30-minute activity, light dinner|
|Night|Relaxation + 7 hours sleep|

Consistency > Perfection.

# 💬 12️⃣ Mindset — The Most Powerful Medicine

Most people fail because they think managing diabetes is “hard” or “restrictive.”  
But think of it this way: **you’re not giving up food — you’re giving your body freedom.**

Every healthy choice today is preventing future suffering.  
Celebrate progress — not perfection. 💫

# 🧩 13️⃣ Myth-Busting: Common Misconceptions

|❌ Myth|✅ Truth|
|:-|:-|
|Eating sugar causes diabetes|Overeating refined carbs and poor lifestyle does|
|Only obese people get diabetes|Thin people can get it too if inactive or genetically prone|
|Fruits are off-limits|Only high-sugar fruits should be limited|
|Diabetes is a death sentence|You can live long and healthy with control|

Knowledge breaks fear.

# 🔔 14️⃣ When to See a Doctor Immediately

Seek medical help if you notice:

* Frequent urination
* Extreme thirst or hunger
* Blurred vision
* Sudden weight loss
* Fatigue or slow-healing wounds

Early action can prevent lifelong damage.

# 🌿 15️⃣ The Long-Term Vision: A Healthy Lifestyle, Not a Temporary Fix

Diabetes management isn’t about a “diet” — it’s a **lifestyle transformation**.  
Once your habits align, your sugar stabilizes naturally.

Remember:

* Eat clean
* Move often
* Sleep deeply
* Stay happy
* Keep learning

>

# 💬 Final Words

Diabetes is not your enemy — **ignorance is**.  
When you understand your body and act early, you can **reverse prediabetes**, **control Type 2**, and **live fully**.

Start small — maybe just a 10-minute walk, one less sugary drink, one extra glass of water.  
Over 90 days, those small steps can **completely transform your health**.

Do I tell the instructor or just give him a wide birth from now on?,"I’m in a group tennis class, and there’s a guy who’s overly friendly with everyone. He seems to know a lot of the club members.
I’ve only had three classes, but after each one he casually asks people to join him for coffee. Usually, everyone’s in a rush and can’t go. The first time I said no and mentioned I might try next week.

When I couldn’t make it the following week, I told him, and he replied, “Oh..? But last week you said you would?” Ans stared at me. I apologized and said something came up, and he repeated, “You said you would though?” I awkwardly apologized again and left and so did he. I waved goodbye from my car and he looked really annoyed.

My partner thought maybe he’s just lonely and wants friends, and suggested I give him a chance.

At our next lesson, as usual he started backchatting the instructor, getting annoyed when corrected, and even took over the lesson saying, “We’ll do this now.” The instructor looked surprised but let it happen.

Later, when I admitted I didn’t know how to keep score, he said, “I’ll tell you over a cup of coffee…” So this time I agreed.
During coffee, I tried to pay but he physically blocked me and insisted. I sat down and he then grabbed plates of cakes and pushed them toward me despite me saying “no thanks” several times. The waitress looked unimpressed.

He explained tennis for about 20 seconds, then changed the topic. He invited me to play more days, but I said I was busy getting my hair cut. He said, “It doesn’t need cutting, it looks lovely.” I just silently drank my coffee.
He then asked me to play table tennis someday. I said no thank you, I don’t enjoy it. He replied, “You’ll learn to like it…”
When I said I had to go, we walked to the car park, it was dark. He was talking about work but I got lost in his story and when I said “oh okay, I get you,” he stopped, took a deep breath, looked at the sky like he was annoyed, and said, “As I was trying to say…”

At that point, I started feeling uncomfortable. He took a step closer and stared at me. I said I really needed to go home and cook dinner for my partner. He said, “I’ve made soup. Do you want to come to my house for dinner?”
I said, “I really can’t, my partner’s waiting for me.” He replied, “But we just had coffee, why do you need tea now?”
I explained that “tea” meant dinner, and he laughed and said, “Hey, I make good soup though?” I said no thanks. As I opened my car door, he said, “Shall we organize that for another time then?”
I just said, “I don’t know about that right now.”
And drove off. 

Am I being dramatic?
From the start, I’ve told this guy I have a partner, but he’s still made several comments about meeting up when I’m out and about. I usually just make excuses like “I might be busy.”

Part of my issue is that I’m too polite. If I’d been more direct earlier, I probably wouldn’t be in this situation 😂
At first, I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and thought he just wanted friends, but after seeing how he acts with the teacher and me, I’m definitely not interested in speaking with him (or his group of friends) anymore.

Would it be over the top to tell my tennis instructor that I feel a bit uncomfortable and would rather leave at the same time as him instead of later with everyone else? I don’t want anything to happen and just carry on as normal.. last two sessions have just been me and the guy as other people can’t always make the lesson. 
I feel embarrassed bringing it up because we’re all adults and I feel bad to involve the teacher like we’re in school! But my partner thinks I should casually mention it and ask the instructor to keep it between us?",1,1759845692.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

You apply to 50+ jobs and hear nothing back. You see fake listings or “urgent hires” that ghost you. It feels rigged and I felt the same way before on my job search 

But LinkedIn isn’t a scam IMO - it’s just a tool, but there are ways that people do find it scammy 

Now what’s real and can land you a job on LinkedIn? 

- Hiring managers are actually on LinkedIn. That’s where they post updates like “We’re hiring for X role.” You can find them by searching “hiring + [job title]” in the posts tab.

- Referrals still work especially if you’re qualified. Talking to a real person, not just applying, gets you closer to the interview. That’s Tier 1 in oir “Four Tiers of Applying” system - the top tier ￼.
	
- Your network is the shortcut. Every message, every coffee chat builds credibility. That’s how most Wonsulting clients land their roles - through real conversations, not just solely focusing on cold clicks ￼

Now, how to spot the actual scams?
Prime example: if a job asks you to pay for “training,” message outside LinkedIn, or doesn’t list a real company page, skip it. Verified recruiters never ask for money upfront (we’ve covered this in our Wonsulting job search lessons).

Just be cautious of those and you’ll be good! Best of luck - you got this~",1,1759845603.0,Wonsulting,0,1.0,False

I feel like I should be able to use this grind for more than a single shot twice a day.

Its happened this morning, I woke up, had my coffee, made my breakfast, all like normal. Normally my breakfast is enough to keep me full, or at least satisfied until lunch time, but today no such luck. I finished breakfast and was still hungry, so i got some fruit. Still hungry, drank some water, still hungry. I even tried some foods I thought maybe I was craving, a few chips and a sliver of brownie, to see if it was just a mental hunger. I can usually quiet cravings once I figure them out, but neither of those worked.

So here I sit. Still hungry like I havn't eaten in hours, feeling a bit guilty now that ive wasted calories on things that didnt solve the problem (might just make today a maitence day at this point). Im on birth control to stop my cycle, and there never seems to be a rhyme or reason for these days.

Does this happen to anyone else or am I just crazy? If im not just crazy, what do you do to cope?",2,1759845264.0,loseit,3,1.0,False
1o0ff58,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0ff58,Decor help (living room pictures are at the end),"Hi everyone. My husband and I just moved into a new house. I’ve been endlessly scrolling through websites for weeks and I just don’t know how to style my brown couches. The pictures with the grey couches were professionally done when the previous owners sold the house. I want replace the black and white rug I have and the coffee table can go too. 

I’m including in these photos inspiration of rooms and rugs/artwork that I like. I just have no idea what would translate to looking nice in my house (built in the late 70s, split level).

There is a second sitting room on the main level that I would like to turn into a reading room with red bookshelves (similar color to the red coffee table pictures, but shade doesn’t need to be exact) so if you see something that would look nice with that, it would be a bonus. 

My question is, what of the rugs and artwork that I’ve gathered would look nice in my living room and match each other? I’m having a hard time telling if things are the same style or not lol. Or if there is a rug that you think would look nice with my room and couch, but is a different style or doesn’t match anything else I’ve pictured, what would go with it?

Sorry this is a long post, but I really appreciate any and all feedback or help! I think if I could just get started on a style I can hopefully start putting together the rest of the room based off of that 😅",1,1759845258.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1o0fdc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1o0fdc3/for_anyone_missing_authentic_south_indian_filter/,For Anyone Missing Authentic South Indian Filter Coffee,"So recently I came across Le Mil’s coffee. One of the handful specialty Indian coffee roasters in the US. I was curious because they have single origin beans from their family farm in Chikmagalur. I’ve been drinking filter coffee all my life and always struggled to find a good coffee that tastes close to the original filter coffee you get on the streets of Bangalore. They roast in Berkeley and use Indian chicory in their filter coffee blend so I thought I’ll give it a try. 

I’m honestly never been so impressed. Their chicory blend is basically spot on. Not sure how they achieved that but this isn’t easy. I have tried narasu, kotha, even Panduranga coffee works that’s straight from chikmaglur but Le Mil’s filter coffee  tastes far better. I guess I really underestimated how much difference it makes when the coffee is roasted locally. This is their filter coffee https://lemils.com/products/le-mils-estate-secret for anyone who cares about the authentic taste of filter coffee.

Next up, I’m going to try their single origin espresso blend https://lemils.com/products/le-mils-ar-8020

***In Chapter 2, Kat returns to her childhood home after a breakup, but the house hasn’t forgotten what she refused to see.***

Kat had not planned to come back.

She had said it aloud to friends. She had said it in the empty apartment while she folded shirts that still smelled like her ex. She had said it to the passenger in the seat beside her as the plane landed at Baltimore International Airport. She had said it to the Uber driver who didn’t care and nodded as if he’d heard this same confession from a hundred customers before.

Kat stared out the window as they passed the George Peabody Library, a modern feat of beauty and utility, and a refuge to her when she was younger. Suddenly she felt like one of those books in there. How long would she be taken out of the life she once loved and borrowed once again by her parents? A month at most. Maybe two, she told herself. She would find an apartment, find a way to square her life again, and stop the dizzy feeling lodged beneath her ribs.

But when the cab turned down the narrow street where she used to live, and the old federal-style brick house came into view, her resolve softened like wax. The map of her childhood was still there. Like Kat, the house was elegant and composed but complicated. Vines crawled up the side, making use of the crumbling mortar for purchase, reaching up to the roof and fanning out across the façade. A white stone archway hovered over the front entrance, and the black shutters were sharp against the fading red brick. But despite the potential, the lawn was overgrown, and the once-white picket fence was crooked and riddled with termite holes. The warped gate hung off its hinge, and the trees, heavy with despair, leaned in as if trying to get a closer look at the grown, blonde woman who was coming home. The recognition wasn’t immediate. The trees only remembered the sad little girl who used to climb them.

When Kat got in the Uber at the airport, she was holding her head high and her shoulders pulled back with the confidence of a guest flying in for a quick visit. By the time she got out, she was as slumped as the white oaks clamoring out of the earth.

Her father, Travis Maxwell, opened the door before she lifted a hand to knock. Some people didn’t need a bell. They had a sense for arrivals, like fishermen sensing the pull of a line through fingers without seeing what was on the hook.

“You look tired,” he said. He didn’t say hello or give an ounce of welcome. He never had. His thin, harsh face, edged with gray, was painted with disappointment. Though he should have been relieved, thought Kat. The breakup saved him the obligatory dowry of wedding reception costs that she had been sure he dreaded, not to mention having to force a smile and look happy as the bride and groom ran away to God-knows-where for their honeymoon.

“I *am* tired,” she said, and felt foolish for being honest. He didn’t really care that she was tired. “Hi, Dad.”

He stepped aside and let her pass, his shoulder brushing hers. Her father still held himself like a larger and younger man than he was, as though the memory of his body had not caught up to his almost seventy years. Up close, she could smell coffee on his breath. The hallway also smelled the way it always had. Cigarettes, fried onions, and a good amount of bleach. Her mother was always trying to clean up her father’s mess. Something sour nested under the paint. The wallpaper leading up the stairs had a hangnail curl at the corner near the baseboard. Beneath it the plaster was darker, as if the wall had bruised and no one had asked why they put the floral bandaid on top of it.

Her mother, Clarissa Wolfe-Maxwell , came out of the kitchen wiping her hands on a towel that once had cherries on it and now held the evidence of sickly pink stains. It reminded Kat of a used tampon. She shuddered.

Her mother’s hug was brief, all elbows and perfume. “You should have called,” she stated. “We would have cleaned up.”

“It’s fine,” Kat said. “I won’t be here long. Thanks for letting me stay.”

That last part rose up in the air and felt silly, like a child who thanked his teacher for sending him to detention.

It won’t be long, she told herself again. Not long at all. But she could almost hear the walls reply, *That’s what you think*.

Her old room became the guest room after she left ten years prior, which meant it had been stripped of things that were hers and replaced with things that suggested no one at all. The bed was the same, though, saddled with time and sagging in the middle. Her hand went automatically to her own stomach when she saw it. Thank God, still relatively flat.

The single window looked out at the neighbor’s brick house, which had undergone the same move towards obscurity. The vines were doing their work there, too.

A small lamp sat on the nightstand beside a saucer of loose screws and dead batteries. Dust lay on everything in a way that felt purposeful. Kat had a feeling her mother wanted to remind her she wouldn’t be staying long, either.

She was unpacking her suitcase, when her mother knocked at the bedroom door. She brought her a glass of water. “You should eat,” she said. “You get thin when you’re unhappy.”

“Everyone does,” Kat said.

“Not everyone,” her mother said simply. “Some people get fat.”

“True,” she replied.

“I know you, Katherine,” said her mother. “You’re unhappy. You won’t eat for days.”

Kat had no energy to get defensive. Her mother was right, anyway. “I’m dealing with it,” she said.

When the door closed, Kat leaned her head against it and closed her eyes. The room hummed. It was that quiet hum she remembered from summer afternoons on the floor with crayons. The house had always had a voice, low and continuous, not the groans of settling or the tick of pipes but something that lived in the seams where wood met nails. She had learned to sleep with it, to make her peace with it, the way the house had made its peace with the vines that strangled it now.

That night in the living room, after everyone had gone to bed and she closed her book, Kat gave an exaggerated sigh. Romance wasn’t the best read after losing Derek, she thought. A Stephen King novel might have been better, maybe something more like *Misery*.

The streetlight’s glow came in through the curtain and made the ceiling look like a slow, pale tide. Somewhere a faucet dripped, the timing irregular enough to feel personal. She counted the seconds between drops until the rhythm gave her a headache. Wasn’t counting supposed to put people to sleep?

Kat decided it was time to give that theory a try, and she got off the couch and went upstairs. After she got ready for bed, she crawled under the covers. She couldn’t hear the dripping anymore, but she still tried counting sheep, or anything else other than the disappointments in life. It didn’t work. She quickly found herself standing in a rising tide of those disappointments.

The first creak from the floor below pulled her away from the edge of sleep. One slow complaint of wood. A pause. Another creak. Then a steady pattern. It wasn’t footsteps or the clumsy wandering of an old house adjusting its ribs. It was a chair. Someone was in a chair, settling into the rhythm of rocking. Back and forth. Back and forth. Not hurried. Patient.

The only rocking chair they had was in the living room, where she had just been reading.

Kat sat up, trying to listen more closely. The sound went on for a minute, the chair finding its pace, then it stopped as if its occupant had heard her sit up and realized they were the ones now being observed. She swung her feet to the floor and slowly opened the door to the hallway. The darkness smelled faintly of mold. *Better get that checked*, she thought, but she knew they wouldn’t.

“Dad?” she called softly.

No answer. Kat held onto the doorframe and waited to see if the sound would come back. When it didn’t, she closed the door and told herself a story about wind and how it makes a house creak. The story didn’t fully convince her, but it made a pillow of itself anyway, and she lay down on it because a person can sleep on anything if she has to, as long as it’s not reality.

When morning arrived, a thin light with the flickering brightness of a bulb that needs changing was pushing its way through her curtains. It was March in Baltimore. The sun wouldn’t give much more than that, not for another month at least. The kitchen smelled of grease and toast and old, caramelized sugar. Her mother stood at the stove frying eggs, wrist snapping expertly. The radio muttered the end of a song, and then a voice that sounded bored with the day read the weather.

“You did not sleep,” her mother said without turning. “I heard you walking about.”

“I thought I heard something downstairs.”

Her mother snorted. “This house talks. Your father says the floorboards are older than his grandfather. We should have replaced them when we replaced the roof, but then he said the roof was still good. It was not.”

“I’m surprised you replaced anything at all,” said Kat, somewhat amused. That was progress.

Her father came in, already wearing a sports coat, and ready for his day. For a man who was retired, he had an aura of constant busyness. He poured coffee and stirred in a way Kat remembered from when she was six. The spoon hit the side of the mug twice, then rested on the saucer, handle pointing to his right. He always pointed it that way. Just like he always took his coffee black. She had built part of her childhood on predictable things like that. It felt strange to see the ritual again and feel nothing but a dull ache. The man you know by his habits and the man you fear are sometimes the same person and sometimes not. She did not feel like deciding which this morning.

“The basement door sticks,” he muttered. “And sometimes it creaks. So do not go down there. Floor is soft.”

“Wasn’t planning to,” she said, and tasted metal in her mouth. He took that as an answer and opened the newspaper, the cheerful snap of it the only bright sound in the room. *Do people still read newspapers?* Kat thought to herself. Sometimes she felt her parents were stuck in a time loop somewhere around the 1940s, but that wasn’t even the era they grew up in. It was the era her grandparents grew up in. Her own parents were old but not that old, yet they were somehow hanging on to a lost time that none of them had ever experienced. “Anyway,” she continued, “the sound I heard was definitely coming from the living room.”

They didn’t respond to that, and kept making small talk through breakfast, punctuated with a lot of silence. After they were finished, Kat tried to make herself useful. She washed dishes that were already clean. She wiped a spotless counter. The house had a way of dirtying stuff without giving you the satisfaction of seeing the dust settle first. She straightened the shelf near the phone where pens went to die. She found a single marble in the seam where the floorboard met the wall and held it to the sunlight. It had a small blue ribbon inside it. She couldn’t remember owning a marble like that. She had a sudden thought of a hand smaller than hers holding it once, the weight of a prize in the pocket of overalls. The image was so quick and specific that she placed the marble on the windowsill as if someone might come to claim it.

She moved the couch in the living room to sweep and discovered a mitten folded into itself. Pink. The size of her palm. She brought it to the kitchen.

“Do you remember this?” she asked her mother.

Her mother frowned as if the mitten had brought with it a smell. “From one of your cousins, I think.”

“Which cousin?”

Her mother shrugged and kept watering one of her plants by the slider door. “How would I know. Your Aunt Beth’s girls. Someone. It must have been there forever.”

Kat turned the mitten over. There was a little brown stain at the cuff. It could have been anything. She set it beside the phone. “I hardly remember those girls.”

“They hardly remember you,” her mother said curtly.

*How am I going to survive a month?* thought Kat.

At least she could take up her time with work and apartment hunting, but still, her stay at her parents house already felt like an endless void that could never be filled.

She went upstairs and stopped in the hallway just outside the bathroom across from her room. The house bore down around her. The cool patch was still there, the place where she had stood as a girl and considered whether she had the courage to go into the bathroom alone. She had hated waking up in the middle of the night having to go in there, maybe having to face the mirror. There were more than enough nights of wetting her bed, even into her preteen years. That always got her roughly pulled off her mattress by her mother, always full of evident rage but never going so far as to hit her, though the way she was dragged around came close. Kat remembered her mother violently pulling down her pants and shaking the soaked clump of underwear and pajama bottoms in front of her crying face, forcing her to see it, to smell it.

Still, despite the humiliation, the house had scared her. Kat kept wetting the bed, until she was old enough to hold it in the entire night. It was the one thing she never told Derek about herself when they were together.

The days went by as they do in houses that decide to keep you. Kat made the best of her apparent imprisonment. Her father would always leave after lunch each day and never share where he was going. Her mother would often take a nap in the afternoon, around the same time. They would eat breakfast together in silence, and during lunch and dinner, they were all pretty much on their own. This suited Kat just fine. The less interaction with those two, the better.

One afternoon, Kat came down to rummage for a snack and caught her mother taking a nap in the rocking chair, her mouth slightly open, the way she had always slept. Kat stopped at the entrance of the living room and stared at her mother’s sagging image. Her mother had always been ruthless in her severity, unemotional and unavailable, but there, on the couch with her mouth slightly ajar and dotted with a touch of spittle, she was just sad. Kat felt the stain of pity spreading in her chest. There wasn’t time for that. Clarissa Wolfe had never had time for that. She had never wanted pity.

That afternoon, Kat walked to the corner store and bought a couple gallons of water, peanut butter, bread, and a few bottles of wine. She wasn’t going to be wandering downstairs for snacks any more than she could help it.

On her walk back, she saw a girl of about fourteen on the stoop of the crumbling brick house next door. The girl’s hair hung back in two uneven braids. She wore a jean skirt, a white short-sleeve blouse, and a red plastic bracelet around her wrist that she was fiddling with. In the early evening sun, Kat saw the glint of light on a tear that fell from the girl’s downward face.

“Are you all right?” Kat asked, because it would have been monstrous not to.

The girl nodded and wiped her face with the back of her hand. “I’m okay, thanks,” she said. “I saw you come home yesterday. Are you Katherine?”

“Yes,” Kat said, surprised. “Who are you?”

“I’m Abbey. I help your mom sometimes,” she said. “She gives me cookies.” The girl lifted the bracelet. “And this.”

“My mother pays you with cookies?”

The girl shrugged. “I like cookies.” Abbey said it with a brave air that made Kat want to hand her the loaf of bread and tell her to run. She shouldn’t like cookies; not from her mother.

Instead, Kat smiled in the kind adult way that tells a child nothing. “Well, it was nice to meet you, Abbey.” She went inside.

Kat hated herself for that small smile. She went to her room and put the goods in the bottom drawer of her bureau. Then she walked over to the window and looked down at Abbey, who still sat on the front stoop but didn’t look like she was crying anymore. Kat’s heart started beating just a bit faster as she stared at the girl who, as far as she could tell, was now embroiled in a conversation with someone standing right in front of her that wasn’t really there. The girl was gesticulating somewhat frantically, evidently frustrated by whatever her invisible friend was saying.

*Is she mentally ill?* Kat wondered, though the girl seemed normal only a few minutes before.

She kept looking as Abbey stopped talking and listened for a moment, as if someone was explaining something that she was finally willing to receive. Her head nodded and dropped slightly. Suddenly the girl snapped her head around towards her window, eyes narrowed in a bitter glare, and Kat almost fell backwards in surprise. When she peered out from the curtain again, praying that she hadn’t been seen, the girl was gone.

That night, her father didn’t return until midnight. Kat was in her room, doing some work on her bed while also planning where she’d be buying a cheap desk to work on. She stopped when she heard the hinge sigh, the pause in the doorway, and the careful progress of a man who did not want to be asked questions. There was another sound with him. A low murmur that wasn’t her mother.

Two voices floated upstairs from the kitchen, soft and close. The scrape of a chair. The brief, familiar metallic kiss of a spoon against a cup.

Kat got up and went to the bathroom, pausing before she walked in, trying to decide whether to sneak down the stairway to see who was with her father. No, she thought, it was probably her mother, or maybe a friend. Kat swallowed nervously, not really wanting to see who was there, not wanting to complicate her life any further. She had felt this way before. It was the house. It was her parents. Complicated. Best not to think about it. She walked into the bathroom.

The mirror over the sink had a crack at a corner that ran along the glass like a dry riverbed. When she moved, the crack ran through her face, dividing her in two, the woman who came home and the woman who refused to acknowledge what bringing your body back to a place like this actually means. She brushed her teeth while studying her reflection, because vanity remains, even when you’re afraid. The jaw still moves. The throat still works. A tiny foam of paste gathers at the corner of your mouth and gets wiped away. It was human to watch your own face, wasn’t it?

She was still beautiful, she told herself. Almost forty and still beautiful. She felt an invisible hand grip at her stomach and twist. She still had time, right? Derek didn’t really matter. There was still time. She could start again.

That’s when the man appeared behind her in the mirror.

He was tall, with sharp bones molding his face, which was almost skeletal and yet, somehow, not unattractive. His head was topped by a thick mop of cropped gray hair. The man wore a black sports coat over a white shirt, tucked into black jeans. Business casual. He was smiling.

Kat saw in that small second of surprise that the smile wasn’t menacing, though she should have felt panic. Instead it was pleasant, as if the man was happy to see her. And above all, in that glance, she saw an infinite patience.

The power in those eyes locked her in place for a moment. It was why she didn’t scream. But when the shock released her, she turned at once to find the bathroom empty. When she turned back to the mirror, she was the only one in it. Kat’s face was pale. She thought of death.

Slowly, she rinsed her mouth out and set the toothbrush down carefully, because carefulness was the last bit of control she could find. She turned off the light, walked back to her room and stood in the glow of her lamp, still too shocked to really make a decisive move for bed.

Kat listened. The house listened back. She could hear the refrigerator downstairs click and whir. She could hear the slow electric buzz of the old lamp. She could hear her blood, a tide moving grainy in her ears. When the rocking started again downstairs, it entered the room without apology. Slow. Steady. A man who has no reason to hurry, who was content to rock and rock until you either came downstairs or fell asleep while trying to ignore it. Either way, whoever it was would wait.

She thought of opening her door and calling for her father again, but the sound of the rocking made her feel young and foolish. The years of crying out for help came back to her, the countless nights of waiting in the dark for whatever it was that she knew would crawl out of the shadows to drag her into them. And here she was, that helpless girl again who would call for her parents, only to discover that her parents were the source of what she feared the whole time.

Once she was in bed, Kat pulled the blanket up to her throat. It smelled faintly of old smoke, mildew, and lavender. At least lying there in the light of her bedside lamp created a circle that felt like a boat floating in the middle of an infinite ocean. It was safe while she stayed in the light, safe as long as the boat didn’t move, safe as long as the dark water didn’t close in to drown her.

A few weeks in, we were both completely wiped and running on coffee and chaos. I finally decided to look into night help and found a night nanny through hellomeela (a site that connects you with vetted doulas and night nannies in your area)

We ended up booking someone for 3 nights a week, and it completely changed everything. She handled overnight feeds, gave us pointers on baby sleep cues, and most importantly we actually got rest. It wasn’t cheap, but the difference in how we functioned (and treated each other) during the day was huge.

1o0fag3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPGIndustry/comments/1o0fag3/mountain_dew_joins_the_dirty_soda_craze/,Mountain Dew Joins the Dirty Soda Craze,"PepsiCo is diving into the “dirty soda” trend with a new launch, Dirty Mountain Dew Cream Soda, set for a national rollout in early 2026. The drink blends Mountain Dew’s signature citrus with the creamy sweetness of classic cream soda, aiming to bring the Utah-born dirty soda phenomenon from soda fountains to store shelves.

If you’ve somehow missed it, “dirty soda” refers to mixing soft drinks with coffee creamers, syrups, and flavored add-ins, a trend popularized by Utah-based chains like Swig and fueled by TikTok and shows like *The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives*. What started as a regional quirk is now a full-blown beverage category, reportedly growing 42% year-over-year, compared to flat growth for traditional soda (per The Food Institute).

For PepsiCo, the move is as much about timing as taste. With Gen Z gravitating toward customization, indulgence, and “premium alcohol-free experiences,” Dirty Mountain Dew represents a way to keep soda relevant in a shifting market.

I’ve been diving deep into 3D product visualization lately cinematic renders, product ads, short animations, etc. I use Blender (and learning a bit of Houdini), and my portfolio is decent with about 5–6 polished pieces (perfume ad, coffee machine, smartwatch, etc).

I live in a country where if Im able to get 800 dollars a month I can get by and recently started freelancing full-time. I’m putting in long hours every day learning, improving, and reaching out on Fiverr, Upwork, LinkedIn, Instagram pretty much everywhere.

But honestly, I’m starting to wonder… is it still realistic to get clients in product visualization now? With AI and so many artists in the market, do beginners(I'm not really a beginner) still have a real chance? What’s a realistic income someone like me could expect in the first year if I stay consistent and improve?

Would really appreciate hearing from people who are actually doing it whether you’re full-time or part-time. Are clients still hiring for product visualization, and do they pay well if the quality is good?",2,1759844744.0,vfx,4,0.75,False

Hi everyone! My husband, 5-year-old son, and I are visiting Lyon at the end of November as we explore the possibility of relocating next year.

I’d love to hear from locals and expats about what it’s like to live in Lyon with kids. I’m pretty convinced that France could be a great fit for our family since I’ve visited many times and speak French fluently. My husband, who’s originally from Benin and also speaks French, is a bit more skeptical after living in the U.S. for years, so I’m hoping he can get some real perspectives while we’re there.

If you’re a parent, an expat, or a non-white person living in Lyon, I’d especially love to hear your experience. And if anyone would be open to meeting for a coffee or park playdate while we’re visiting, that would be amazing. It would really help my husband get a first-hand sense of what life in Lyon is like.

Thanks so much in advance for sharing your insights!


Bonjour à tous ! Mon mari, mon fils de 5 ans et moi-même nous rendons à Lyon fin novembre afin d’explorer la possibilité de nous y installer l'année prochaine.

J'aimerais beaucoup avoir l'avis des habitants et des expatriés sur la vie à Lyon avec des enfants. Je suis convaincue que la France pourrait convenir parfaitement à notre famille, car j'y suis déjà allée plusieurs fois et je parle couramment français. Mon mari, qui est originaire du Bénin et parle également français, est un peu plus sceptique après avoir vécu aux États-Unis pendant des années, alors j'espère qu'il pourra se faire une idée plus précise pendant notre séjour.

Si vous êtes parent, expatrié ou une personne non blanche vivant à Lyon, j'aimerais particulièrement connaître votre expérience. Et si quelqu'un était disposé à nous rencontrer autour d'un café ou dans un parc pendant notre séjour, ce serait formidable. Cela aiderait vraiment mon mari à se faire une idée concrète de la vie à Lyon.

Howdy neighbors,

It is our pleasure to invite you all to the newest and hopefully finest restaurant in Puerto Vallarta. My name is Gerardo, I’m a third-generation partner, and my grandfather founded our restaurant group.

We are Santo Coyote, a restaurant with roots in Guadalajara since 1997.
We are a family-owned restaurant that celebrates Mexico and employs more than 200 Mexican workers across our four branches in the country.

We just opened our doors for business last Friday, October 3rd.

We serve fusion and traditional Mexican dishes for lunch and dinner, and we also offer an amazing breakfast buffet with a wide variety of Mexican options.
Breakfast is served from 8:00 am to 12:30 pm, and our lunch and dinner menu is available from 1:00 pm to 11:30 pm.

We are soon to open inside our restaurant a coffee shop that will open from 7:00 am and will have a variety of quality coffee, champurrado, and hot coco options with mexican pan dulce. Stay tuned for news regarding this.

We’d like to use this post to connect with the puerto vallarta community and to ask of you what do you think Puerto Vallarta needs in the restaurant options in the city and what would you like to see in our restaurant

Feel free to ask any questions—I’ll be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.

2. People say Winston didn't have a character for the first 2 seasons (Lamorne himself said so) but I'd argue Cece is even less of a character than Winston is. She's the straight man in a show with 4 funny men, and I honestly don't remember much of her character in the first few seasons other than her being relegated to the hot best friend and not being able to keep her hands off Schmidt. The first time i genuinely thought she was funny was the birthday episode where she slapped Jess' boobs and showed up at work hungover. Looking forward to when we eventually get Winston + Cece messaround episodes because I remember them being my favourites.

3. Schmidt is so goddamn hilarious, so much more than I remember him being initially. Max Greenfield steals every single scene he's in and quite literally everything he says is so quotable. I am just as high strung as he is in real life so seeing a male portrayal of this is actually kind of refreshing (we're all used to the Monica from Friends archetype being portrayed from the girls perspective onscreen). I would react the same if someone made crayons in my conical burr grinder, because my morning coffee is one of my few joys in life and no fancypants hipster barista can make coffee as good as I can at home.

4. Nick. I hate Nick. I know, this is probably the 9999th ""why do people even like Nick"" post you're seeing and I'll probably get comments like ""why don't you like Nick, I love him and keep watching, his character development is amazing"". I hated him when I first watched the show, and I still hate him now. He's a slob, he sits and mopes around feeling sorry for himself, he claims he quit being a lawyer and became a bartender because he wanted to happy except we see him be anything BUT happy in the show, and something about the way Jake Johnson talks as Nick just irritates the hell out of me, like he tries way too hard to be funny instead of it coming naturally to him (the infamous Cookie scene being one example of an irritating Nick scene to me). ""He's written to be attractive from a woman's perspective"" and I'm sorry I can't see it. I find Schmidt and Winston WAY funnier than Nick. ""YOU GET ONE WIFE"" is the only time I laughed at a Nick line. That, and his crush on Russell. Other than that, I just don't find him interesting, well-written, charismatic, funny or likeable. He's a loser who never peaked in life and thinks he's better than everyone else for it. Schmidt thinks he's better than everyone else but dude at least owns his doucheyness. 

5. Jess and Nick are not a good couple. Yes Zooey and Jake have onscreen chemistry but that doesn't mean they have to be paired up romantically. It's the exact same problem I had with Ross and Rachel in Friends, because the moment you pair the two up and make them ""the main couple"", the storyline gets so incredibly predictable and boring that you have to break them up to not lock them into just having storylines with each other, never mind that them as a couple just didn't work the same way Ross and Rachel were toxic for each other. Cece and Schmidt are like Monica and Chandler except Cece is nothing like either of the two and Schmidt is Monica but much funnier and far more self-aware, so pairing the two up actually works in the show's favour, so I guess they're actually nothing like Monica and Chandler except to be the healthy 2nd couple with a functioning relationship to contrast against the ""will they, won't they"" first couple, which I don't mind at all.

I'm midway through season 3 right now. The whole Schmidt Betty and Veronica-ing Elizabeth and Cece is a real low point of the show but I know it gets better (thank god for Winnie the Bish, he's single handedly carrying so many episodes).",5,1759844472.0,NewGirl,2,0.86,False

# Introduction to Acidity and Its Impact

Acidity is one of the most common digestive problems people face today. Whether it’s the burning sensation in your chest, sour burps, or discomfort after eating, almost everyone has experienced acidity at some point. In medical terms, acidity happens when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing irritation and a burning feeling known as heartburn. While it may seem harmless in the beginning, frequent acidity can interfere with daily life and lead to more serious health issues if ignored.

So, why is acidity becoming such a concern in cities like Nashik? With rapid urbanization, changing food habits, and increasing stress levels, acidity cases have been rising steadily. Street foods, spicy curries, irregular meal timings, and a sedentary lifestyle all contribute to the problem. For many residents of Nashik, the easy availability of fast food and late-night snacking culture have made acidity more common than ever.

It’s important to understand that acidity is not just about overeating spicy food. It reflects an imbalance in our body’s digestion system. Left untreated, it can turn into chronic acid reflux disease (GERD) and even damage the esophagus lining. That’s why learning when to rely on home remedies and when to consult a doctor for [**acidity treatment in Nashik**](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/about-dr-chaitanya-lodha/) is critical for long-term health.

# Signs and Symptoms of Acidity

The body usually gives early warning signals when acidity begins to develop. Unfortunately, many people ignore these signs until the condition worsens. The most common symptom is a burning sensation in the chest, also known as heartburn, which usually occurs after meals or at night. This burning may even travel up to the throat, leaving behind a sour or bitter taste in the mouth.

Other signs include bloating, burping, nausea, and [stomach discomfort](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/medicine-gastroenterology/liver-stomach-gb-diseases/). Some people may also complain of difficulty swallowing or feeling like food is stuck in the throat. Interestingly, acidity symptoms are often confused with those of gastritis, indigestion, or even heart problems. For instance, chest pain caused by acidity can sometimes mimic a mild heart attack. This is why medical evaluation is important when symptoms become frequent or severe.

Chronic acidity is more serious than occasional acidity. If you experience heartburn more than twice a week, persistent coughing, or hoarseness in your voice, you might be dealing with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD requires proper medical treatment because it can damage the esophagus lining over time. Knowing these symptoms and paying attention to your body is the first step toward effective [**acidity treatment in Nashik**.](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/medicine-gastroenterology/liver-stomach-gb-diseases/)

# Common Triggers of Acidity

Have you ever noticed that acidity gets worse after a late-night pizza or a cup of strong coffee on an empty stomach? That’s because food and drinks play a major role in triggering acid reflux. Spicy curries, oily fried snacks, tomatoes, citrus fruits, chocolates, and caffeinated drinks are some of the most common culprits. Alcohol and smoking further irritate the stomach lining, making acidity more likely.

Apart from diet, lifestyle factors are equally responsible. Skipping meals, overeating, lying down immediately after eating, and wearing tight clothing around the stomach can all increase acidity. Stress is another silent trigger. When the body is under pressure, it produces more acid, and digestion slows down, creating a perfect environment for acidity.

Some medical conditions can also make acidity worse. Obesity, pregnancy, hiatal hernia, and certain medications (like painkillers and antibiotics) increase the risk of acid reflux. In a city like Nashik, where long working hours, irregular food timings, and stress are common, these triggers become even more noticeable. Identifying personal triggers and avoiding them is one of the best ways to manage acidity without relying too much on medicines.

# Home Remedies and Lifestyle Changes for Acidity Treatment

Before rushing to the pharmacy for tablets, it’s worth trying home remedies and lifestyle changes. Simple practices can bring quick relief and even prevent acidity from becoming chronic. One of the oldest remedies is drinking a glass of cold milk, which helps neutralize stomach acid. Similarly, chewing a few basil (tulsi) leaves, drinking ginger tea, or consuming a teaspoon of fennel seeds after meals can soothe the stomach.

Dietary changes are crucial. Eating smaller meals at regular intervals, avoiding late-night dinners, and reducing oily and spicy foods can make a huge difference. Instead of three heavy meals, try five to six smaller meals spread throughout the day. Hydration also plays a key role. Drinking sufficient water and including buttermilk, coconut water, and fresh fruits can ease digestion.

Along with diet, lifestyle adjustments are equally important. Regular exercise improves digestion and prevents excess acid build-up. Yoga poses like Vajrasana and Pranayama are especially helpful for those struggling with [acidity in Nashik](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/about-dr-chaitanya-lodha/). Managing stress through meditation, deep breathing, and hobbies also lowers the chances of acid reflux. These changes may take time, but they provide long-term relief and reduce dependency on medicines for **acidity treatment in Nashik**.

# When to Try Over-the-Counter Medicines

For many people, popping an antacid seems like the quickest way to fight acidity. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines like chewable tablets, syrups, and acid-reducing capsules are easily available in Nashik’s pharmacies. These medicines work by either neutralizing stomach acid or reducing its production. They offer quick relief, especially when acidity strikes suddenly after a heavy meal.

However, it’s important to use OTC medicines wisely. While occasional use is generally safe, frequent self-medication can mask serious underlying problems. For example, taking antacids daily without addressing the root cause may lead to dependency and side effects like constipation or kidney issues.

Doctors recommend trying lifestyle changes and home remedies first. If symptoms still persist, occasional use of OTC medicines is fine. But if you need them more than twice a week, it’s a sign that you should consult a[ gastroenterologist](https://arihantmultispecialityhospital.com/about-dr-chaitanya-lodha/). In Nashik, you’ll find both small local clinics and large hospitals where specialists can provide proper guidance for safe and effective **acidity treatment in Nashik**.",1,1759844281.0,u_Drsapnadeore,0,1.0,False

The goal remains the same: achieving balanced extraction and a distinct flavor profile for each batch of coffee. However, the tools have changed, becoming smarter than ever.



The latest roasting systems, such as [Roast.AI](http://Roast.AI), Stronghold S9X, and Ikawa Pro V4, no longer simply record temperatures and time; they analyze in real time how the coffee interacts within the drum—from heat absorption to color development, gas emission, and even the degree of mechanical expansion of the beans.



These systems use machine learning algorithms that predict the ideal roast level based on historical data, adjusting power input or airflow in real time to achieve a ""perfect curve"" that matches the roaster's taste or customer's requirements.



Artificial intelligence doesn't replace humans; it expands their understanding. The expert roaster still decides when to ""stop"" roasting. However, the machine now allows them to control the roasting process to within 0.1 degrees Celsius and track the Maillard and carbon dioxide reactions in real-time, something that was previously impossible.



Impressively, these technologies have opened the door to transparency in the specialty coffee trade. A roaster in Riyadh or Jeddah can share the same roasting curve with a colleague in Seoul or Melbourne, achieving virtually the same flavor from the same Yemeni, Saudi, or Ethiopian crop.



In this way, coffee is transformed from an ""obscure art"" to a ""replicable science,"" without losing its craftsmanship.

I'm buzzing with excitement, a little bit of imposter syndrome, and a whole lot of coffee. My task for the day was simple: clear out the staging database so I could run some tests on a new feature. Easy enough, right? I pop open the terminal, feeling like a real hacker from a 90s movie, and type out the command to wipe the tables clean.

I hit Enter, and the cursor just… blinks. For a second, nothing happens. Then, the logs start flying by, way faster than I expected. My staging database was small, but this thing was deleting thousands upon thousands of rows. A cold dread starts creeping up my spine, that horrible feeling when you know you've just done something catastrophically wrong. My heart sinks into my stomach as I stare at my screen and see the connection string. It wasn't pointing to `staging_db`. It was pointing to `PROD_DB`.

I have never moved faster in my life. I yanked the ethernet cable out of my laptop like I was diffusing a bomb. For a solid minute, I just sat there in dead silence, with my screen frozen and my career flashing before my eyes. I was the guy. I was going to be *that* story they tell new hires for the next decade. I finally got up, walked over to my senior dev's desk with my knees shaking, and whispered, 'I think I just deleted the production database.'

He just looked at me, blinked slowly, and without a single word of panic, said, 'Okay. Let's go get some coffee and then we'll check the backups.' Turns out, the backups were only 15 minutes old and we got everything restored pretty quickly. But man, that was the longest 15 minutes of my entire life. I learned more about database permissions and triple-checking my work in that single afternoon than I did in my entire degree.

A sanctuary disguised as a resort. It doesn’t shout luxury. It whispers transformation. The kind that rewires something deep inside the restless, the weary, the overfed and overtired. This is where monks meet modernity, where Thai healing traditions collide beautifully with anti-aging science and green smoothies that taste better than they have any right to.

Guests trade deadlines for detox rituals, schedules for silence, and fluorescent light for the soft glow of sunrise over the sea. There’s yoga at dawn, when the sky bleeds gold and pink, and meditation so quiet the mind begins to sound like ocean waves. The spa treatments here feel like an ancient language spoken through touch. Herbal compresses and aromatherapy oils crafted from lemongrass, kaffir lime, and galangal. Each scent carries centuries of Thai tradition, each movement an echo of monks who understood that balance isn’t something you find. It’s something you return to.

Chiva-Som isn’t about deprivation. It’s indulgence with a conscience. Meals arrive as art. Vibrant bowls of papaya salad bursting with lime and chili, steamed seabass dressed in ginger and coriander, mango with sticky rice presented like a love letter to sweetness. Smoothies hum with tropical fruits and herbs plucked from the resort’s own gardens. Even the tea feels medicinal, laced with pandan and lemongrass, cleansing in ways coffee never could.

Adventure lies just beyond the serenity. Hua Hin invites wanderers to kayak along mangrove forests where monkeys chatter from the trees, or hike Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, where limestone peaks crash dramatically into the sea. Kite surfers slice through the waves as fishermen haul in their catch along the beach. It’s a balance of chaos and calm. The heartbeat of Thailand itself.

The best time to visit Chiva-Som is between November and March, when the air is clear, the sea forgiving, and the evenings smell of jasmine and salt. It’s the season when the body feels light, and the world slows down just enough to catch up with yourself.

Chiva-Som is not simply a resort. It’s a quiet rebellion against the noise of modern life. A place that doesn’t just pamper but recalibrates, where the line between therapy and pleasure blurs completely. In this corner of Hua Hin, the art of healing becomes an adventure of its own. Sensual, restorative, and alive with the timeless rhythm of Thailand.

1o0esmj,https://i.redd.it/dzn24smyyotf1.jpeg,[Discussion] What is the best brown dial in watches?,"Brown dials are probably my favorite least popular dials. I think brown is one of the moser versatile colors ever, From dark like coffee, to medium like wood to tanned as caramel, & although you don’t see many brown dials the few you see can be absolutely beautiful. 

The first brown dial I loved as a kid was the brown speedmaster which I thought was just so awesome compared to the standard black speedy & had so much more character than your typical black sapphire sandwich & still one of my all time brown favorites.

Another one of my favorites is the limited Brown dial overseas, a chocolaty shade sunburst of brown that was only produced for a few years which is a shame as I think it’s probably just as nice as the blue dial. 

This one I love so much is the vintage two tone Rolex root beer with its nicely aged dial which you guessed it, looks like root beer. A shame the modern root beer doesn’t have a brown dial like the vintage one 

I’ll throw in a couple Seiko’s last, the SRPB46 with it’s signature presage pattern & the SRPH55 with it’s unique brown turtle shell dial which I’ve yet to see any other watch imitate anything similar to it.

—

To my baby love, I appreciate all the things you’ve done for me, from the smallest to the biggest. Paying for my food, buying me coffee (even when you don’t want to because I drink too much of it), getting me medicine in the afternoon when I had a toothache, even when it was too bright and hot outside and you hated that the most but you still did it without me asking. I appreciate you cheering me up before my interviews, or whenever I feel nervous about something.

I love those times when you’re playful and out of your serious, masungit mode. You’re such a cutie when you tease me.

I love everything you do, but would it be wrong to ask for more? Because I want more.

The normal things couples do together aren’t things we do. I envy them and honestly, it hurts so much.

Sharing food, something I love doing and something so simple for other couples, feels impossible for us. It’s like it shouldn’t be done. Why is that? Are we just really different?

Watching movies? You do that alone, without inviting me like most boyfriends would. Even when we’re in the same room, you don’t reach out or ask if I want to watch with you.

Trying new things or playing new games? You ask your friends first, not me. I’m jealous asf and I just wish you’d think of me first, ask me first, and want to share those moments with me too.

Even walking together feels strange. You walk too fast, tell me to keep up, and never hold my hand.

The pain isn’t shared and when it is, it feels ignored. I feel less than a partner, and I know relationships shouldn’t feel like that. So why does ours?

We share the same bed, yet it feels like there’s a wall between us.

I can’t help but wonder, what am I to you? What goes through your mind when you look at me?

Sometimes I feel like you only need me when it’s convenient for you.

I can’t stop thinking that maybe s** is the only thing you truly desire, and the only thing you want us to share.

And I’m scared… scared that once you no longer need me in your bed, I’ll be left alone and discarded.

Maybe you don’t really love me. Maybe you just love the idea of having me when you need me.

Did I give in too fast?
Do I love too much?
Am I too much?

I have so many things to say, but I can’t seem to process them all in my head. It’s too much, and I hate it.

I want to talk to you and tell you that I’m hurt but I can’t. I don’t have the courage to open up, and I’m in so much pain knowing I have to keep all this inside me because you’re fighting your own battle right now, one I can’t help with… because you won’t let me in.",0,1759843580.0,offmychest,2,0.5,False
1o0eq8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1o0eq8x/panic_attacks_irritability_walking_outside/,Panic attacks/ irritability walking outside,"Hi,

I’ve been dealing with panic attacks for the last nine years. I’m currently on 20 mg of fluoxetine daily, which I started taking three months after the attacks first began. So far, this medication has been the single biggest factor in improving my situation, particularly in reducing the frequency and intensity of the attacks.

Despite this, they still persist. I’m a 27-year-old male, 6’2” and of healthy weight (13.7 stone). The attacks typically happen when I’m outside walking alone. I feel light-headed and off-balance, even though I’m not actually off-balance. There’s a strong sensation of impending doom, as if something really bad is about to happen, and I feel the need to escape the situation—even though I know I’m physically fine.

I’ve tried many things over the years to improve my situation. This includes the standard approaches: therapy, deep breathing, meditation, and of course, exposure therapy, which I practice as much as possible despite how I feel. However, this only seems to have taken me so far. I can’t identify any psychological trigger since the very beginning, apart from the situational element of being outside without an easy exit.

While it may sound psychological, I must insist that the reaction my body has is completely over the top. Because of this, I started looking into possible physiological causes for this overreaction. Nine months ago, I was diagnosed with celiac disease. I immediately started a strict gluten-free diet, hoping that healing my gut would fix the issue. I know it’s easy to assume that’s the cause, but despite improvements in my energy over the past nine months, the panic still remains—mainly in those outside situations.

A few years ago, I also discovered that I have severe sleep apnea. I began treatment using a CPAP and a MAD device to ensure it’s controlled. It now is: I don’t snore and my AHI is below 5 when treated. But again, the panic persists.

I’ve also explored a range of supplements, including:
	•	Fish oil
	•	Vitamin D3 and K2
	•	L-glutamine
	•	Zinc
	•	Magnesium L-threonate
	•	Omega-3
	•	B-complex vitamins
	•	5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate
	•	Turmeric
	•	Colostrum

I’ve taken these daily for about a year. While I’ve noticed some improvements in mood and energy, the core panic issue hasn’t gone away. I took up running 5 Ks last year to help with my general anxiety. My baseline anxiety is now lower, but the moment I walk outside alone, the panic hits.

I’ve been very consistent with therapy, exposure work, medical treatments, and supplements for years. Yet my body still seems to overproduce stress hormones or overstimulate the stress response in a way that feels excessive and out of proportion. It’s almost as if more adrenaline is released in me than in the average person, or that my body doesn’t regulate the response normally.

There are a few patterns I’ve noticed:
	•	Exercise like running or climbing, or drinking alcohol, seems to temporarily improve things.
	•	Bright sunlight makes things worse, but wearing sunglasses helps.
	•	Coffee and hangovers both make it worse.
	•	Coming off fluoxetine in the past made it significantly worse as well.

I’m fairly sure that after years of therapy and exposure, this issue is not purely psychological. It seems more likely that I have an overactive fear/stress response (a physiological issue) that isn’t functioning normally.

I’ve carried out multiple medical tests, including:
	•	HbA1c (normal)
	•	Basic blood panel (normal except mildly elevated ALT, which has trended down with the gluten-free diet)
	•	Thyroid T3 and T4 (normal)
	•	Serum Zonulin (normal), though stool Zonulin was abnormal (retested 4 months ago)
	•	Cortisol 4-point test (normal)
	•	Testosterone (normal)
	•	Calprotectin (normal)
	•	Stool tests for fungi and parasites (none detected)

The panic seems to be triggered initially when I walk outside alone or even with someone else. I experience a startle response that is disproportionate to what’s actually happening. My body then shifts into a more panicky state that I have to consciously resist. Sometimes, when I’m with someone, the pressure to hold it together makes it worse, because my body is already on high alert.

This is something I’ve been dealing with for a very long time, and I’m desperate to get to the bottom of it.

Do you have any suggestions as to why this might be happening if it’s not psychological? Are there any further tests I could do? Has anyone else experienced the same thing?",3,1759843575.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I liked her and having recently faced the loss of my wife it was nice to be able to laugh again.
What I didn’t realise was her husband didn’t know about some of our meetings.
the friendship grew and I was asked to do favours for her which I didn’t mind as I liked her a lot in fact fell in love with her.
But then things took a serious turn when she decided to spend quite a lot of money on a car without her husband knowing and bought furniture and asked me to store it for her.
I started to realise I was being used and felt a bit sick.
I tried to speak about it and realised I wasn’t the only ‘coffee’ buddy in her life and perhaps one was more than that.
I was really annoyed with myself for not realising sooner I was being taking advantage of.
I met her parents and they are lovely people and I’m sure they are unaware of her behaviour.
Anyway now she doesn’t speak to me and I returned her stuff and I’m the ‘enemy’ even though I would have done anything for her and if she wanted a relationship with me post divorce we could have seen how it went.
It’s awkward as we are neighbours.

**Blurb (Chapter 1 only)**

His family was his world. Now he’s in a new one.

When a fatal accident rips Caleb Foster from his wife and kids, the forty-year-old gets a second chance in a realm of dungeons and monsters. A cosmic system offers him a choice of legendary powers, but Caleb refuses the flashy magic. He chooses the abilities to learn faster, remember perfectly, and master any physical skill.

A father's instinct to protect doesn't die with his family. To survive and shield the new lives that depend on him, he must use a lifetime of quiet competence to navigate a dangerous frontier town, hunt deadly beasts, and outwit men who mistake his lack of flash for weakness.

**In a place where might makes right, Caleb is about to show that the most lethal weapon is a mind that misses nothing, and a will that never quits.**

The alarm murdered sleep with its digital shriek. Caleb groaned and fumbled across the nightstand, his hand slapping blindly until blessed silence returned. 5:45 AM glowed accusingly from the clock face. Another Monday. Another week of meetings about meetings, reports that no one would read, and the slow grind toward a weekend that would pass too quickly.

He rolled to Evelynn, studying her in the pre-dawn light. Even after eighteen years, something about watching her sleep still made his chest tighten.

He slid from the sheets and stood, stretching muscles that protested more with each passing year. The morning inventory began: the ache in his lower back, the stiffness in his knees as he trudged to the bathroom. The bright light pressed into his eyes, casting its harsh glow across the tile. Caleb adjusted the temperature dial and stepped into the shower stall, bracing himself for the inevitable.

The cold spray pricked his skin, each drop a tiny sting of acceptance.

As it warmed up, he stood under the drizzle longer than necessary, letting hot water pummel sensation into his reluctant body. Eventually, the guilt of wasting time overcame the comfort, and he shut off the valve, releasing a sigh. Towel. Deodorant. Shirt. Pants. Socks. The uniform for another day in the cage.

At least there was coffee. Always coffee.

The kitchen welcomed him with its usual shadows. Muscle memory guided him through the ritual—filter, grounds, water, the satisfying click of the power button. Soon the machine gurgled to life, promising chemical salvation in ceramic form. He leaned against the counter, watching the darkness retreat from the windows as suburbia stirred to consciousness.

Strange how he was unable to shake the restlessness, an itch between his shoulder blades he couldn’t reach. It felt like time had stalled at a red light while the rest of the world accelerated past him.

""Good morning,"" Evelynn commented as she entered the kitchen, already dressed for the day in yoga pants and one of his old university sweatshirts. She moved with the efficiency of someone who’d refined her daily routine to an art form.

""Hiya, beautiful."" He poured her coffee. Two sugars, a touch of cream, precisely the way she'd preferred it since their dating days. Their fingers connected briefly as she took the mug, and she tossed him a wink.

Pausing to search his eyes, she asked, ""Thinking about the vacation again?""

""Maybe."" They'd been planning this trip to Hawaii for two years. There was always something pushing it back. Katie's travel soccer schedule, Jack's scout excursions, and his work deadlines. Now it was finally happening, just three weeks away, and instead of excitement he felt... what? Anxiety? 

*Crumb, what's wrong with me?*

Zoning in, Caleb realized he’d delayed responding to a question about his mother’s last-minute visit and her expectations that they’d make room for her. ""Of course she does."" Caleb took a long sip of coffee, buying time. ""Let me guess—she's already picked the dates and assumes we'll rearrange our lives accordingly?""

""Thursday, the fifteenth through Monday the nineteenth."" Evelynn's lips quirked. “I told her about Katie’s tournament that weekend.”

""And she said?""

""That surely one soccer game wasn't more important than seeing her only grandchildren.""

""One soccer game."" He snorted. ""Right. Because the regional championship is basically a pickup game in the park.""

Evelynn's hand found his. ""We'll figure it out. We always do.""

Before he could respond, Hurricane Katie burst through the doorway. ""Mom! Where's my green jacket? I need it for the thing today!""

""What thing?"" Evelynn was already moving, setting down her mug to help search.

""The thing! You know!"" Katie's voice pitched toward panic. Sixteen years old and every minor crisis was still the end of the world.

Jack slouched in behind his sister, earbuds firmly in place, oblivious to the jacket emergency. At thirteen, he was a master of selective awareness. Caleb caught his eye and mimed taking out the earbuds. Jack responded with a sigh that told the story of a thousand parental injustices, but complied.

""Morning to you too, buddy.""

""Morning,"" Jack said, slumping onto a stool at the kitchen island. ""What's for breakfast?""

""Whatever your mother conjures up while saving your sister from the apparently life-threatening absence of green outerwear.""

""Found it!"" Evelynn emerged from the laundry room, triumphantly brandishing the jacket. Katie snatched it with a quick ""Thanks, Mom"" before whirling back to face Caleb.

""Dad, you're still taking me to driver's training Saturday, right?""

Driver's training. His little girl behind the wheel of two tons of metal and combustible fuel. When had she gotten old enough for that? Seemed like yesterday she was begging him to push her higher on the park swings, copper pigtails flying.

""Wouldn't miss it, kiddo.""

""You promise? Because last time—""

""I promise."" He held up three fingers solemnly. ""Scout's honor.""

""You were never a Scout,"" Jack pointed out through a mouthful of toast that had materialized from somewhere.

""Details."" Caleb ruffled his son's hair, earning a half-hearted protest. ""Your mother was a Girl Scout. It counts by marriage.""

Evelynn slid plates in front of each person—scrambled eggs, toast, sliced fruit arranged with an almost unconscious precision. She made it look effortless this morning choreography of feeding and organizing their small army.

""So what's everyone got going on today?"" Caleb perched on his usual stool, fork in hand.

""Chemistry test,"" Katie said between bites. ""Which I'm totally prepared for.""

""History presentation,"" Jack added. ""Which I'm... mostly prepared for.""

""Mostly?"" Evelynn raised an eyebrow.

""Like seventy percent. Seventy-five. Okay, sixty, but it's about the Civil War and everyone already knows how that ends.""

""Spoiler alert,"" Caleb deadpanned. ""The North wins.""

""Dad!"" But Jack was grinning.

He soaked it in. The four of them around the island, trading jokes and gentle ribbing, the kitchen warm with coffee steam and morning sunlight. For this brief moment, the restlessness quieted. This worked. These moments made the rest bearable. The commute, the meetings, the sense that he was slowly fossilizing in his ergonomic desk chair.

""Alright, troops."" Evelynn checked her watch. ""Time to mobilize.""

The next few minutes were a blur of gathered backpacks, distributed lunches, and last-minute searches for homework that had definitely been completed but had somehow vanished. Caleb stood in the eye of the storm, doling out hugs.

Katie squeezed him quickly, already halfway out the door. Jack submitted to a brief one-armed embrace, too cool for anything more demonstrative. Evelynn lingered, her arms clenched around his waist.

""You okay?"" Her green eyes studied his face.

""Yeah."" He pressed his lips to her hair. ""Just Monday blues.""

""Love you.""

""Love you too.""

He stood in the doorway, the warmth of his coffee mug fading. He watched her shepherd their children into the minivan. Katie claimed the front seat through some arcane sibling negotiation. Jack slumped in the back, earbuds already reinstalled. Evelynn gave him one last wave before backing down the driveway.

The house fell silent. Just him and the ticking kitchen clock and this weird energy crackling under his skin. Like he'd had too much caffeine, except his mug was still mostly full.

*Get it together, Foster.*

His sedan waited in the garage, familiar as an old shoe. Same parking spot for eight years. Same crack in the windshield he kept meaning to fix. Same dark stain on the passenger seat from the time Katie spilled her hot chocolate.

The engine turned over on the first try—reliable, predictable, boring. The scent of stale coffee and cheap air freshener filled the cabin. He tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, trying to shake the feeling that something was different about today. But the street looked as always. Mr. Mulder was already out watering his lawn, waving as Caleb pulled out. Mrs. Zastrow power-walked by with her ancient terrier. The Weber kids waited at the bus stop, backpacks bigger than their bodies.

Same neighborhood. Same route. Same life.

He turned left at the stop sign. Always left, never right, though right would take him to the highway, to anywhere but the office. Past the elementary school where Katie had learned to read and Jack had broken his arm on the monkey bars. Beyond the strip mall with the Chinese place they ordered from every Friday and the dry cleaner who knew him by name.

Red light at Maple and Third. He'd sat at this exact light approximately two thousand times, give or take. Watched the cycle of green-yellow-red while his life ticked by in traffic signal increments. His reflection caught him off guard—when had those lines around his eyes gotten so deep? The hairline was definitely retreating, a slow surrender to genetics and time.

*Forty years old. When did that happen?*

The light changed. He accelerated past Riverside Park, trying not to look at the playground. But peripheral vision betrayed him. There was the swing set where he'd spent countless afternoons, pushing Katie and Jack toward the sky while they shrieked with delight. The bench where Evelynn used to nurse Jack while Katie built empires in the sandbox.

They never went there anymore. Katie was too old, too cool, too busy with friends and phones and the mysterious social dynamics of tenth grade. Jack preferred his video games to fresh air. And Caleb... when was the last time he'd suggested it? When had he stopped trying?

*This is what a midlife crisis feels like, isn't it?*

The thought came with equal parts recognition and embarrassment. Such a cliché. Successful man realizes his mortality, questions his choices, probably buys a motorcycle or has an affair with his secretary. Except he didn't want a motorcycle, and his ""secretary"" was a shared admin named Doris who was sixty-three and spent her breaks showing people pictures of her grandkids.

What did he want? That was the question rattling around his skull as he merged onto the parkway. He had everything he'd been taught to want. The house in a good school district. The stable marriage to a woman who still made him smile. Kids who were turning out pretty damn well, all things considered. A job that paid for all the above with enough left over for saving.

Check, check, check, and check.

So why did it all feel like a costume that didn't quite fit? Like he was playing a character in someone else's story?

He jabbed at the radio, hunting for distraction. Nothing but morning DJs making tired jokes and ads for products he didn't need. The audiobook app on his phone offered the next chapter of some business guru's guide to success, but the thought of listening to one more minute of ""synergistic thinking"" made his teeth hurt.

Silence it was, then. Just him and the road and this restless energy that seemed to be building rather than dissipating. Like static before a thunderstorm.

*Maybe I need a vacation more than I thought.*

Hawaii. Sun and sand and mai tais by the pool. No emails, no meetings, no reports on reports. Simply his family and the ocean and time to remember what it felt like to be present instead of always seeking some escapist distraction.

Except even that felt scripted. The vacation they were supposed to take. The memories they were supposed to make. Checking another box on the list of Things Successful Middle-Aged Fathers Do.

*Yikes, listen to yourself. You've got a good life, and you're sitting here whining about it.*

The guilt wasn't new, almost comfortable. How dare he feel dissatisfied when so many people had so much less? When Evelynn juggled the endless demands of managing their household and raising their children? When his biggest complaint was boredom?

But understanding the irrationality didn't make the feeling go away. If anything, it sharpened the edge, adding self-loathing to the mix of unnamed longings and vague disappointments.

Traffic slowed as he approached the city center. Brake lights bloomed red in the morning sun, a river of people flowing toward their own acceptable cages. He drummed his fingers faster, the rhythm matching his accelerated heartbeat.

The restlessness beneath his skin wasn't an itch anymore; it was a desperate, kinetic energy demanding release. A prayer for disruption. *Let something happen. Anything.* The thought was a betrayal of the safe, good life he'd built, but it was honest. He felt coiled, a spring wound so tight that the slightest nudge would snap him.

The light ahead turned yellow. He could make it if he sped up, slide through just as it changed. Save thirty seconds on his commute. Arrive at his desk that much sooner to begin another day of—

A flash of red in his periphery. He turned his head, and the world compressed to the grille of an enormous SUV blasting through the intersection.

Time dilated, stretching like taffy. He saw the other driver's face, eyes wide with realization. Saw the front bumper aimed at his driver's door like a battering ram. Had a split second to think, with perfect sharpness:

*Evelynn.*

I call, email, find people on Facebook, etc. they all seem interested at first some I even meet for coffee and to exchange business cards but I keep getting the same response, “it seems to good to be true”.

---

Sorry for any formating issues this is my first post to Reddit ever- but I'm so ecstatic about my suspension that I had to share it with the world. 

Firstly, I knew I was going to hate this place from the get go. They lowered my pay $2/hour, 6 months after I had signed on at the contracted rate, due to their own mistake in writing the rate of pay. Took that through the grievance process and won!! Manager has had the biggest bone out for ruining my life since. 

The first two hours of shift: everyone else can sit around with their thumbs up their butts- ME THO?? Written up. How dare I sit down for 5 minutes on my 12 hour shift of straight walking and stair climbing!! 
Coffee at Tims?: everyone else can go whenever tf they want + still get their hour lunch- ME?? Nono, thats time theft, coffee can only be purchased within the lunch hour. 
Not seen on camera?: not a problem for literally anyone else- ME?? I better be accounted for AT ALL TIMES. 

There are a ton more little things that have been brought up in the probably close to 15+ union & HR meetings I've had in this job, I just don't care to remember them all. 

Finally got to the point where I was done with the BS and took a leave of absence for my own mental health. Doctor wrote me one week off. I did some volunteer work, relaxed, got my self back together so I didn't quit on the spot. Live in Canada, can't find a family doctor, so took a little longer coming back than I had hoped too. Timings in between doctor appointments were so far apart that I did more volunteer work in between. My work has this special bank we can pull from to use for any occasion as its hours we worked, just set aside instead of paid out- so after my doctors note expired I just switched to that.

Well when I came back to work? Pulled RIGHT back down to HR. It was as if I had broken into the Manager's house and slept with her husband with how mad she was. ""Why couldn't you work?"", ""Why didnt you use modified leave?"",  yadda yadda yadda..... a full blown investigation into my time off. 

Today they finally scheduled the follow up meeting and they gave me a 2-day suspension!! I've literally never been so happy! 1. Because they were idiots and broke so many labour laws by writing stupid clauses of 'things I must do' into it. So it'll be a breeze to fight. 
2. Because they split the 2 days, which means my typical 3-on/3-off/4-on/3-off becomes a 2-on/5-off/3-on/3-off 

And FINALLY 

3. Because FUCK that place man. Im going to apply to so many jobs while Im off! I'm going to win back the pay I lost for these 2 days and then slap her with a ""See you later loser""

1o0ecwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o0ecwp/ive_been_stuck_at_the_youth_with_psychic/,"I've been stuck at the Youth With Psychic Abilities facility since I was twelve. On Christmas Eve, I managed to get out","I was playing cards with Ethan, a pyrokinetic and a sore loser.

That asshole kept burning the cards to ashes every time I won. 

Ethan, designated as category red, was the closest thing I had to a friend. 

He was a big dude with a surprisingly bigger heart; an ex-high school jock who had become my roomie two years prior. 

I could tell he’d been popular—probably from an affluent family—so he likely wasn’t staying long. 

They brought him in one night, kicking and screaming, and strapped him to the bed opposite mine.

For the first few weeks, Ethan wasn’t allowed to use his hands. 

He sat cross-legged on his bed and told me how he’d set his entire town alight. 

Okay, ""entire town"" was an exaggeration. 

He later admitted, it was just a movie theater, and his school locker. 

Sitting in the cremated remnants of his letterman jacket, with his thick brown hair and freckles, he looked like the textbook boy-next-door. 

I thought he’d be harder to talk to, but he was oddly talkative. 

At first, I thought it was the drugs they force-fed him, but then he became obsessed with telling me his life story.

Apparently, he’d accidentally burnt his girlfriend’s eyes out at prom, which somehow led to him to going full pyro.

I know, I told him it was extra. 

I admit, I was initially pretty scared of the guy. 

It’s not exactly brainwashing, but the moment we’re brought into the facility and categorized as lower levels (blue, indigo, and violet), we’re taught to steer clear of kids categorized at higher levels. 

Those are the ones who need to be muzzled and collared: pyros like Ethan and kids like Carlisle, the girl in the room next to mine. Emma, who could teleport. 

Emma was mostly mute. She was also REALLY bad at chess. 

Carlisle was a Speaker, capable of bringing her own words to life, and super powerful for all of her 17 years on earth. 

She told her guard he was suffering from a brain hemorrhage, and seconds later, he was. 

Carlisle wasn’t just being held at the YWPA because of her ability. 

She was being protected from world leaders and other ne'er-do-wells who could easily use her for their own personal gain behind closed doors. 

Kids like Carlisle and Ethan were the lost causes. Here one minute, gone the next. 

I half-expected Ethan to disappear one day while I was being tested on, or forcing down mystery meat that passed as cafeteria food.

But it had been almost two years, and pyro boy was still my roommate.

I was category blue, a high-level telekinetic, so it’s not like we could relate to each other. 

Ethan was more likely to be executed at eighteen due to the severity of his case.

But weirdly enough, I enjoyed his company.

Just like school, the YWPA had a social hierarchy. 

Blues, who were most likely to be recruited for some shady government program, were at the top. 

JJ and Alex, lower-level blues, had already invited me to join their little gang, but I wasn’t interested in their weird obsession with becoming soldiers. 

I’d been brought in at twelve: those kids had been at the YWPA since birth, never seeing sunlight and being subtly conditioned to enjoy the idea of becoming mindless drones for some higher power.

Those types of kids were noticeably more feral and animal-like, baring their teeth when guards grabbed them for daily testing. JJ was already giving me cult-leader vibes. Instead of being scared of his ability, he embraced it. 

Meanwhile, I had a feeling the mandatory Friday classes for low-level blues were screwing with their brains—maybe even prepping them for recruitment. Luckily, I was able to avoid it.

It wasn't easy at first. But the second I was dragged into a classroom-like setting, with an ancient analogue television at the front, I knew my fate. 

It was part of being recruited, after all. 

People in the real world weren’t interested in noncompliant telekinetics. 

They wanted brainless shells. 

There was only one way of getting out of mandatory classes, which were either life lessons for the rare occasion that you would be released, or plain fucking brainwashing. I had no choice but to play the unhinged card—which was risky and could either end with me getting executed or sent to therapy.

So in the cafeteria, I staged a breakdown, pinning several kids to the ceiling. I was taken down almost immediately, of course, and thankfully, instead of “military training” in my schedule, I had “Psychokinetic Therapy.” 

So, instead of being subjected to what I could only guess was some seriously messed up shit (judging by the rapid decline in the blue’s humanity), I sat in a room with my personal therapist, who taught me how to manage my power and not abuse it.

Speaking of the other blues, they started being more annoying than usual, sitting at their usual table embedded in a game of silent chess. 

Which was chess, but nobody talked, and each member used their ability instead of their hands. 

This kind of information has been nailed into my brain since my imprisonment inside the YWPA, so I know the nitty gritty of the category blue. 

When you're categorised as blue, you can either be a low level or a high level. 

Low levels can do simple telekinesis, which is moving or controlling an object or organic matter with their mind. 

High levels, however, can extend their ability to the brain. 

That's one of the reasons why blues are so popular in recruitment. 

Whereas low levels are wanted for their simple ability to move objects, high levels are in demand for their ability to control minds, like influencing or erasing memories, and in some cases, managing a complete take-over of the original organic personality. 

As a high level, I knew my day was coming sooner or later. 

I couldn't fully master what we called Influence yet, but I did successfully manage to push my instructor to punch me in the face, and then erase his memory of performing that action. 

Which meant I was extremely close to being recategorized at a higher level. Which meant re-evaluation. 

It was Tuesday, which was a free day. 

Nepo babies were allowed monitored time with their parents, while the rest of us had to keep up appearances in front of the elites, pretending we were having the best time ever and definitely weren’t being prodded and tested on. 

I mean, if these people were as perceptive as they thought, they’d notice the blood stains. Right?

The velcro straps on every bed. The execution room, which was just one big industrial furnace.

Every time someone was burned alive, the YWPA played Taylor Swift at full volume.

When I was thirteen, I was being dragged back to my room in cuffs after standardized testing. I remember the right side of my body was numb and my nose was bleeding, beads of warm red dripping down my chin. It itched as it dried, but I couldn't do much about it. 

The drugs were already destabilizing my limbs, making it impossible to run, my vision swimming in and out of focus. All I could see were clinical white walls crashing into me like ocean waves.

I wasn’t expecting to hear Taylor Swift. 

I can’t remember what song it was, just the same lyrics repeating as I was dragged down the hallway toward a bright orange blur.

“Move,” my guard ordered, shoving me forward. 

That song followed me all the way back to my room. 

When I was freed from my cuffs and shoved inside, I layed down and pretended I couldn't hear the agonizing screams from adjacent cells slicing through those lyrics. 

I had pretty much accepted my fate as either ending up in there, being fucking barbecued to an upbeat pop song, or joining my fellow blues as a military drone. 

I didn't even fucking dream of walking out of the YWPA on my own two feet. 

With my mind intact, at least.

Christmas in the YWPA was about as fun as you would expect. 

There was a single Christmas tree themed sticker on the wall for a “decoration.” 

But I wasn't even sure if some kids even knew what Christmas was. 

Jessa, who was executed three days after her arrival, asked JJ if he wanted to do a secret Santa, and the boy looked at her like she was crazy. 

Jessa was another scary one, a category *grey*. 

Her ability was similar to a Speaker, but on a mass scale. So, you can imagine how fucking terrifying she was. 

But she didn't look scary, she looked harmless! Jessa was tiny with orange pigtails and a gentle smile.

As cute and innocent as she looked though, Jessa could obliterate our universe if she wanted to. 

She could also prevent war if she wanted to. 

The rumor mill churned, and I heard from an Indigo, that Jessa had snapped her own family out of existence. 

But Jessa used her power for small things. She wanted a puppy, and bam, there was one in her lap. 

She wanted a swimming pool, and suddenly, a whole new indoor pool hall just appeared at the end of the first floor. 

She was both a miracle and a curse, and I don't think the YWPA trusted her– and others were out there hunting her down. 

Jessa was only there for three days, but had left an impression. 

The swimming pool, for example. It's not like we could use it, but it was still there. 

The white plastic seat where she'd sat cross-legged, eagerly asking people's names, sat sadly empty. 

Back to the card game. 

I was losing patience with Ethan, who thought burning my cards would make him a winner. 

The worst part is, he was actually making me laugh, shooting me a grin every time my Queen burst into flames. 

It was funny the first few times, but was getting progressively less entertaining. 

He was like, “Ha! Look how funny this is!”

I laughed the first few times, but by the eighth time, I was questioning his maturity. 

When the large metal doors to the rec-room flew open, Ethan flinched, his gaze glued to his half cremated deck of cards. 

He was about to turn the big one eight, which meant his evaluation was soon.

Execution, or, if they were feeling merciful, maybe a re-sentencing until he was twenty five.

I kicked him under the table when he didn't lay down his cards. 

Ethan kicked me back, his eyes growing frenzied. 

“Fuck.” He whispered, his gaze dropping to the table. “I bet they've come for me.”

I kicked him again, this time reassuringly. “You're still seventeen, dumbass.”

“Yeah, but not for long!”

I raised a brow. “Why would they kill you at seventeen?”

He curled his lip. “Because they're assholes.”

Leaning across the shitty fold out table, I fixed him with a smile. “What if you're fire-proof?”

“Fireproof?!”

“All right, listen up!”

The voice snapped me out of it. 

Twisting around, Warden Carrington stood in the doorway, twirling a pair of metal cuffs. 

She was a stiff, narrow bodied woman with a blonde top-knot and a permanent grin. 

She took pleasure in escorting kids to be executed. Something sour crept up my throat. 

Is that what this was? 

No, executions were usually private. 

Tests, maybe? 

I was used to mandatory ones every Friday. That's what the cuffs were usually for. We were taken from the rec room individually, cuffed, and dragged to the testing rooms. But it wasn’t Friday. 

The floors were too clean. I was used to blood seeping across tiles on a testing day. 

I wasn't allowed to look the warden in the eye as a Blue, but I managed a risqué glance. 

She was smiling suggestively, so it had to be an execution. Realization crept in then, that the slight curl on her lip suggested exactly the opposite. 

Recruitment.

I scanned the room.  

Fifteen fearful faces stared at her.  

A willowy blonde who had previously been reading a book, was now sitting up straight, her half-lidded eyes wide, almost awake. 

She caught my gaze, lips pricking into a smile. 

Slowly, the girl inclined her head, a single blonde curl falling into her eyes. She ran her index finger across her throat, mouthing, “We’re fucked.”

Could it be Matthews? 

My gaze flicked to the brunette curled up in the corner of the room. 

Carlisle? I used to talk to her. 

We were from the same town, so we had that mutual connection. 

But something happened to her after a testing session, and since then, Carlisle shut everyone else out and isolated herself. 

Matthews was immortal, and Carlisle had the power to end the world. 

I doubted either of them were being recruited.

“The holidays came early, kids!” Warden Carrington mocked, and I sensed the group of us all holding a collective breath. 

“J!” she boomed. “You’re getting out of here!”

There was an awkward silence before Ethan kicked me. 

“Bro, that's you!”

He was right. Slowly, I got to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest. 

I was J. 

Which was crazy, because the only kids who made it out of the YWPA alive were either nepo babies or… 

My excitement started to wither once I'd hugged Ethan a quick goodbye, and offered Carlisle a sympathetic smile. 

I thought, just for a moment, that maybe my Mom had come to get me– finally, after five years. But my mother was dead. 

I watched a man who called himself Mr. Yellow blow her brains out with a smile, before kneeling in front of me. 

I was standing in my mother’s blood, watching slow-spreading crimson seeping across her favorite rug.  

“Hey, there, little guy,” he said, his eyes maniacal, grin widening. “Do you want to come to a super special place?”

The ‘super special’ place was obviously the YWPA.

I didn't even get to fucking mourn my mother. 

And to everyone in the outside world, twelve year old me had murdered my  Mom. 

The outside world has no idea about our abilities, or the YWPA. 

So, to them, I was yet another psycho kid. 

There were only two ways to get out of YWPA: in a body bag, or the other way—the one I dreaded.

Warden Carrington was smiling with way too many teeth when I slowly made my way over to her. She grabbed my arms, linking them behind my back and cuffing me. 

“You’ve been recruited!”

I was dragged out the door and down the hallway. 

At the end, surprisingly, stood a guy, around college age. 

He was tall, a pair of raybans pinning back dark blonde hair, wearing a long trench coat that hung off his slim frame. In his hand was a small paper bag he was swinging excitedly. 

The closer I was getting, being unceremoniously pushed forward by the warden, the guy’s swinging became more and more eager. 

I was convinced he was going to accidentally fling the bag in my face. 

I wasn't expecting to be recruited by a teenager resembling Sherlock Holmes.

“Hi!” He greeted me, genuinely excited to see me. The boy motioned for the warden to uncuff me, and she did, making sure to keep hold of my arms, her bony fingers pricking into my flesh. 

“It's great to finally see you in person! I’ve been trying to get you out of here for weeks! But there's so much paperwork, and blah, blah, blah, it was a whole mess,” he rolled his eyes. 

“But here you are!” His southern accent was already irritating. He grabbed my shoulders with teary eyes like I was a stray fucking cat he had just adopted. 

“You're J, right? I'm Nathaniel!” he held out the bag, and I caught the unmistakable smell of fried food. 

“Do you want Five Guys?”

Warden Carrington cleared her throat. “Not in here,” she drawled, “The smell will wake up Will.”

Will was a higher level category yellow (a shifter). But I fully understood why. 

Werewolf. 

Apparently, he'd been sacrificed during his frat’s hazing ritual, gaining the ability to shift his flesh to a dog-like beast. 

As well as adapting a liking for human flesh. 

There were two incidents with Will, and both of them ended in him cannibalizing at least three inmates. 

Nathaniel looked intrigued, but he kept his mouth shut. I was handed a fresh set of clothes to change into, before being shoved through the main doors. 

I couldn't believe I was actually breathing in real, ice-cold air.

I could feel it tickling my cheeks, blowing my hair out of my eyes.

In the real world, I stuck out like an anomaly in my clinical white shorts and tee.

I was standing on concrete, uneven and gritty beneath my shitty converse. 

Twisting around, I stared up at the YWPA—a looming glass building. 

We were in the middle of nowhere. 

I hadn’t noticed on my way into YWPA because I was blindfolded. 

Nathaniel pointed across the parking lot. There was only one car, and it was his: an expensive, sleek-looking Range Rover. 

I tried to jump into the back, but he patted the passenger seat. 

Nathaniel slid into the driver's side. “So, there are, like, actual werewolves in that place?”

I shot him a look, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. 

I didn’t know why he was fascinated with werewolves when there were kids in there who could snap us out of existence if they were slightly annoyed. 

“Well, there's Will.” I said, shrugging. “Then there's the leader of their pack.” 

He looked intrigued. “So, these kids are like, what, *original* werewolves?” he snorted. “That's what was in the report.” 

“Yeah.” I said. “Will told me.""

His eyes widened. “Wait, so like REAL werewolves?"" 

When I didn't reply, he blew a raspberry. “Damn. Keeping me on edge! I *like* it.”

Slipping onto the warm leather seats, my muscles started to relax. 

I was so used to the harsh, shitty plastic chairs in the YWPA rec room.

And then there were the blood-stained metal gurneys I had to sit on during testing.

But this—this was an actual *seat.* 

I had missed cars. 

I’d missed being able to sink into cushions.

To relax.

Nathaniel started the car, cranking up the radio.

Taylor Swift.

He shot me a grin, reaching into the back and grabbing the bag of Five Guys.

“Hungry?”

I was.

I ate the burger in two bites and almost choked on the soda.

“Dude,” Nathaniel chuckled, side-eyeing me. “The food isn’t going to run away!”

Asshole.

I started inhaling the fries, ignoring his little jab.

“I can understand, though. Of course you’re fucking hungry,” Nathaniel said, his gaze flicking to the road ahead. 

I couldn’t resist pressing my head against the window, slurping my Coke. 

The vivid red and orange blur of traffic flying past was making me carsick. 

“I know what goes on inside that place. The inhumane shit they do to kids like you.”

“Kids like *me*.” I stopped chugging, a sour bite to my tone.

He sighed. “You know that's not what I meant.”

“Sure.”

I caught his expression darken significantly, his fingers tightening around the wheel.

“I’m sorry, J,” he said, his tone cracking slightly. “For what those assholes did to you. I fought to get you out of that place.” he scoffed. 

“They kept trying to shove another kid in my face, but I told them it was either you, or I was out of there.”

“Why me?” I didn't turn around to look at him, my gaze stuck to blurry holiday lights flying past us. 

They were too bright in contrast to the darkening sky. 

Nathaniel didn't respond, cranking up the radio. 

I wasn't buying this guy’s friendly act. I had a hard time believing his ‘save the children’ bullshit.  

“So, what do you need me for?” I asked, making myself comfy, throwing my legs up on the dashboard. “Construction? Did your cat get stuck up a tree?”

“Nope.” His lips curled into a smirk. “Do you know what day it is?”

I gestured to an illuminated snowman outside. 

“Easter.” I deadpanned, and he broke into giggles. 

“I'm sorry, how old are you?” he spluttered. 

“Seventeen.” I said. “Eighteen, in January.”

He snorted. “I'm actually sixteen.” 

“You're not.”

“I am! I just *look* older because of the trench coat and shades.” he shot me a grin. “And it's clearly *working*! Dude, you totally thought I was, like, a junior in college.” 

Nathaniel sighed, leaning back in his seat. “I've been told I have a “baby face”,  sooo I dress like a boomer.”

This guy was making it hard for me to not like him. 

But I was taken off guard when he drove me to the airport. 

Nathaniel threw his jacket over my shoulders, looking me up and down. 

“All right, you're good,” he ruffled my hair. “Luckily for you, kids our age literally wear anything. So, yes, you may look like you've been institutionalized, but my coat gives you a hipster vibe, y’know?”

I had no idea what he was talking about. He sounded like an Animal Crossing character. 

“I don't have an ID,” I managed to hiss out when he pulled me into the airport. 

It was surprisingly quiet for Christmas Eve. 

I expected to be questioned about my lack of passport and identity,  but Nathaniel, despite his age and lack of maturity, could easily pull me right through security with a flash of his badge. 

He gestured to a nearby coffee store, handing over way too many bills for a drink. 

“Flat white, and a bottle of water,” he said hurriedly, swiping through his phone. “Feel free to go crazy. Get as much as you want.”

I had almost 500 dollars pressed into my palm. 

So, yes, I went crazy. 

I almost turned and ran, taking the cash with me. 

But my Mom was dead. There was no home to go back to. 

I bought a double chocolate brownie hot cocoa to go, and turkey and stuffing sub, devouring both of them before I even left the store. 

Nathaniel was waiting for me. 

He sipped his flag-white, leading me straight past the gate. 

When a guard stepped in front of us, he shot them a smile. “It's cool, we’re exceptions,” he said. 

The guard paused before nodding and stepping aside. 

“Have a good flight,  boys,” his lips broke out into a grin, “Oh, and happy holidays!”

Nathaniel winked at the man, smirking. “You too, Bobby!”

I couldn't resist opening my mouth. “How did you…?”

Nathaniel just grinned.

I was expecting first class seats, but instead, I was ushered onto a private jet. 

So, Nathaniel was riiiiiich, rich. I had a bed as a seat. 

I slept for most of the flight, dreaming I was back in the YWPA, back on my blood stained mattress counting ceiling tiles. 

*“So, how is it?”*

Ethan loomed over me with his arms folded. The startling white of his shorts and tee made my eyes hurt. 

I didn't blink, stretching out my stiff legs. His voice was kind of muffled. 

“It's okay, I guess,” I said, “I had Five Guys.”

Ethan pulled a face, tipping his head back. 

*“Ugh. Don't. I’m pretty sure they gave us recycled slop for dinner.”*

I rolled onto my side. “Was it the chef's special macaroni and cheese?”

*“Yep.”* Ethan curled his lip. *“They're trying to kill us with the food.”*

I nodded, enjoying my ex roommate’s company. 

Though I wasn't sure why he was pacing up and down. 

“The second I’ve built up this guy’s trust, I’ll get you guys out of there.”

I felt my heart squeeze, and I swallowed sour tasting puke. “Before you turn eighteen. I'll get you out of there.”

Ethan frowned, leaning closer, his brows furrowed like bugs. 

I blinked rapidly. 

Like tiny wiggling little furry bugs. 

“Dude.” I was pretty sure there weren't supposed to be two Ethan’s. The two Ethans leaned forward. “Can't you smell that?”

I could. 

It was potent, like bleach, suffocating my throat. 

Ethan jerked back, his eyes were wide. *“That smells like–”*

Reality slammed into me, but my eyes were glued shut. 

I knew exactly what it smelled like. 

I didn't even remember getting off of the plane. 

I  woke up, groggy, in the back of an SUV, my mouth full of metallic ick. 

I tried to move, and I couldn't, my arms reduced to sausages. 

I thought back to the water I sipped on the plane. How it tasted a little too bitter. 

“Did you drug me?” I managed to get out in a hiss. 

I couldn't even panic, my body was paralyzed, my chest heaving, my heavy pants into thick leather seats were suffocating me. 

Nathaniel’s laugh sounded like waves crashing into my skull. 

The car took a sharp turn, and I almost tumbled off of the seat. 

“It's just a small job, J,” he said, “We’re counting on you.”

It took all my strength to drag myself to the window. 

I could see my breath coming out in clouds of white, tiny white flurries dancing across the pane. 

Snow. 

The drugs were fucking with my head. I slipped in and out of consciousness, dancing between the living and the dead. 

Ethan was sitting next to me, his head pressed against the window. “How do you even get out of shit like this? he tried the door, slamming his fists against the door. 

*“Locked,”* he said. 

I managed a spluttered laugh. “No shit.” I caught myself. “What the fuck do I do?”

Ethan shrugged, his gaze glued to the snowstorm. *“Maybe try diving out of the car?”*

“When it's locked?!”

Before I could lecture Ethan on basic common sense, the real world slammed into me in waves of ice water– literally. 

Someone had opened my door, and I could feel the wind chill grazing the back of my neck. 

I opened my eyes when two muscled arms wrapped around me and yanked me out of the car. I couldn't stand, immediately falling limp in his grasp. 

“Come on, J,” Nathaniel’s voice tickled my ear. “We’re nearly there.”

I wasn't sure were ‘there’ was. I was up to my knees in snow, blurred white closing in on me from every angle. 

With my body immobile, Nathaniel dragging me felt fucking dehumanizing. 

He forced my head up, but it kept hanging, my thoughts dancing, my eyes flickering. 

“It's a simple job,” he said when I was more awake. 

In front of me was… something. 

It reminded me of a warehouse, a towering structure that almost looked like it was part of the storm. Nathaniel pulled me further, chuckling. When I parted my lips to cry out, he promptly slammed his hand over my mouth. 

“Do the job well, J, and we’ll think about taking you on full time.”

We reached a garage-like door, and with the click of a button, it was slowly gliding upwards. 

To my surprise, this place reminded me of a lounge. 

There was a desk, a short blonde wearing a Christmas hat sitting behind a laptop. 

“Nate.” she deadpanned, her gaze stuck to the laptop screen. “Did you get him?”

“No, Stella,” Nathaniel’s tone pricked with sarcasm. “As you can see, I definitely don't have him.”

The girl nodded slowly. “Cooooooool.” she said. “Good talk.”

Ignoring Stella, Nathaniel pulled me into an elevator. 

When the doors slid shut, I found my voice, pulling from his grasp, but my body was stiff and wrong. I dropped to my knees, shuffling back. “What is this place?”

The boy didn't answer, leaning against the door, his lips curled into a smirk. 

“It's a super *special* place.”

Something sickly crept up my throat. He was mimicking Mr Yellow’s words. 

My mother’s murderer. 

When the elevator slid open with a loud groan, the first thing I saw was intense clinical white light. 

The room reminded me of a surgical theater that had long since been abandoned, flickering lights swinging overhead. I saw the first splatter of blood on the floor right in front of my feet. 

I've grown desensitised to blood over the years, but this was more than a splatter,  a dark crimson streak trailing all the way to the center of the room. 

There were four plastic chairs positioned in a circle. 

When I glimpsed velcro restraints hanging off of the arm rests, I felt my body start to twist and contort in a desperate attempt to escape. 

Two chairs were occupied by kids my age, metal helmets strapped to their heads; a strawberry blonde girl with her head bowed, her lips and chin stained scarlet. 

She was limp in the restraints, her body hanging forward.

Opposite her was a guy, slumped over, hiding behind thick brown curls. 

There was a growing pool of red stemming around him. 

When he lifted his head, I had to fight back a cry. 

The guy’s eyes were pearly white, half lidded, all of the color drained from his iris. I recognized it. 

I had only ever heard of a kid’s power burning out through word of mouth. 

I had been taught that our abilities were like a muscle, and like a muscle, you could strain it. The first symptom of burnout was losing all the color in your eyes, but this guy was in the later stages. 

Judging by seeping red oozing from every orifice, he had already suffered multiple haemorrhages. 

My gaze found the helmet on his head. 

They kept bringing him back, forcing his body to revive again and again, purging his power for all it had. 

His lips were cracked, slick scarlet. 

I couldn't tell what ability he possessed, or his level. Just that he was suffering. 

“You've gotta be… fucking… kidding me,” he sobbed. 

“Lucas, it's Christmas.” Nathaniel mockingly scolded. “I told you about profanity.”

“Go fuck yourself.”

Nathaniel forced me to stand. “All right, introductions!” he said cheerfully. 

“Guys, this is J.” 

The strawberry blonde jolted in her chair, but she couldn't lift her head. “He's going to be helping us today.”

I cringed away when he patted me on the back. “J! This is Luke and Tory! High level blues, and my favorite little helpers.”

Nathaniel shoved me into a chair, a metal helmet forced onto my head. Nathaniel knelt in front of me, his eyes sparkling. 

Insanity, I thought dizzily. But there was something beyond that, a darkness shrouded in his eyes that he didn't want me to see. He pinned my wrists to the armrests, offering me a smile. 

“Your job,” he murmured in my ear. “Is *my* old job.”

He straightened up. “You see, we kept failing,” his expression twisted. “Every fucking year we failed, and more of us died. We couldn't do it. No matter how hard we tried, none of us were strong enough.”

I fought back, and with a simple twist of his wrist, my body was paralyzed. 

He was strong. 

“I was the best we had,” Nathaniel sighed. “They took me from the YWPA in Vancouver. I was just a kid. Eight, maybe? I was dragged inside this room, forced into one of these fucking chairs, and my brain was fried over and over again, until I was numb,” he choked out a hysterical giggle. 

“I stopped feeling pain around the tenth or twelvth time those bastards brought me back. But it was okay, because I could do it. I was the only one who COULD fucking do it, so why not use me for all I have?”

Was he… crying? 

Nathaniel swiped at his eyes with his sleeve, forcing a smile. “Anyway, then the demand grew, and it was suddenly so much fucking harder to control, or even lift off the ground. I was tortured in an attempt to strengthen my power, but I couldn't do it. I guess you could say I wasn't strong enough.”

Nathaniel’s smile widened. “But you guys are!” he started to clap. “So much stronger than me! I mean, you're amazing. Luke, who turned his family into his personal minions! You truly have a *gift*.”

I could hear the envy dripping from his tongue. 

The blonde let out a whimper, her bound hands jerking. 

His gaze found mine. 

“J.” He said. “What you did to get yourself in the YWPA was quite remarkable! Honestly, I bow down to you.”

“Please.” Luke  whispered, spitting blood on the floor. “I… I *can't* do…it.”

“Well, guess what? It's your lucky day, Lucas, because you have help now!” 

Nathaniel danced over to him, patting his helmet. When the boy lunged at him, he spluttered. “Ooh, bad dog! What did I fucking say about using your teeth?”

Lucas didn't respond, and I noticed the glint in Nathaniel’s eyes. He wasn't just crazy. This asshole revelled in being in  control. “Soo, over the last few years, we’ve always focused on movement,” he twisted around, winking at me. 

“Now that, my fellow freaks, was a big mistake.”

A large wooden contraption was dragged in.

“Because why focus on movement?” Nathaniel continued. “When we have something even better?”

I recognized what it was. 

The holiday lights strung across the back seat.  

The back, filled with sacks overflowing with wrapped gifts and toys. 

But something told me this was a front for something far darker. 

“Okay!” Nathaniel shouted to someone above us. “Let's do a test run, all right? Everyone in position?”

“Nate.” Tory’s strangled cry sliced through the silence. She whipped her head back, her eyes rolling back to pearly whites. “You're going to kill us!”

Ignoring her, he turned to me. 

“How many people have you taken over, J?” 

Nathaniel came closer, his eyes narrowing, lips curving into a spiteful smile. “How many minds can you force yourself inside?”

His question sent prickles of ice slipping down my spine. 

I hadn't answered that question in a long time. I was too scared to. 

“I don't know,” I managed to get out. 

“Aww, come on!” Nathaniel cocked his head. “Maybe… a million?” he wagged his brows. “Two million?”

“I didn't mean to,” the words were choking my throat before I could stop them. I didn't realize how right the chair felt, the restraints, until I was reminded that I really was a fucking monster. 

“I was just a kid.”

Nathaniel’s expression softened, his lip twisting. “I know you were,” he said. 

“So was I when I told my pops to off himself.” he frowned. “Which begs the question,” he hummed. “You're a category blue at one of the highest levels, and yet the guys back at the YWPA decided not to toast you–”

It looked like he might continue, before a yell cut him off. 

“Nate, we’re all ready!” 

It sounded like Stella, from upstairs. “I just need your go ahead!”

Nathaniel didn't respond for a moment.

He slowly made his way over to me, fixing my helmet on my head, and checking my restraints. 

I thought he was sympathetic, or maybe he was, in his own fucked up way. But then he was running his hands through my hair, grabbing a fistful, and forcing me to look at him. 

His eyes terrified me. Not because of his ability, or his descent into madness. 

But because somewhere, deep, deep down, twisted in traumatised eyes filled with agony, I think part of him didn't even want to do this. 

“What you did, J,” he whispered, “Fifteen years ago. I want you to do it again.” 

Turning to the others, the boy grinned. 

“How many children are on the planet, hmm? How many of them believe in the big guy?”

I didn't notice it at first. 

The pain. It was numb first, dull, like a phantom nothing dancing across my skull. 

It was like being hit by lightning an infinite number of times. 

Each one hit the back of my head, burning a hole inside it. 

I didn't realize I was screaming, crying, choking on my blood  begging for mercy. 

When I was a kid, it almost felt like drowning. 

I didn't feel pain, instead, a stark numbness taking hold of me, and the crushing weight of names, wishes, memories, thoughts, bleeding inside me. 

Back then, I barely grazed their minds. 

Then I let go, plunging down, down, down, and awakening in my mother’s arms. 

This time, I found each and every one. Ones that had grown up with me, and ones that were much younger, entangling myself with them. 

I could feel my brain coming apart, bleeding, running down my temples, and seeping down the back of my neck. 

“2.4 billion,” Nathaniel said. 

“That's 2.4 billion minds to give one simple... very subtle order.""

That they would never even know they were giving. 

Just like when I was a kid. 

*Fly.* 

The word twisted on my lips, but that was more prominent inside my mind. 

Whatever was on my head, the helmet strapped to my skull, I could feel it moulding itself to my spinal chord, a screech ripping from my lips. 

I was burning, suddenly, my brain igniting, my body jerking left and right. 

I could already feel wet warmth running from my nose, my lips, my ears, every vessel inside me coming apart, a neutron star collision dancing across the backs of my eyes. The command was already inside my head. 

Our heads. 

I could sense and feel, almost touch Luke’s mind. 

Tory was harder, fading in and out, her body was already failing, already rejecting it. 

In front of me, the wooden contraption moved slightly, and Lucas’s head dropped. 

When it started to hover, Tory’s scream grew feral, animalistic, her cries growing into pleads, begging for death. 

The sleigh had taken flight, hovering above us. 

But I couldn't sense Luke anymore. 

That entangled string binding us together, had been cut. 

Through half lidded eyes, I think he was moving, his fingers still twitching under velcro straps. 

But the sleigh was flying, and despite the agony ripping through me, my body slowly shutting down, my mouth became a smile. 

I was aware of my head going limp, all of me slumping, my head tipping back. 

“That's right!” Nathaniel’s voice was fading. “Make it flyyyyyyyyyy.”

Yeah, I thought, unable to resist a spluttered giggle. 

I was making it fly.

After three test runs, and then the real thing, spluttering on my last gasps of air. 

I was partially aware of Nathaniel lifting me from the chair and dumping my body somewhere cold, somewhere where the ice cold chill was merciful on my soul. 

Dying felt weirdly comfortable, kind of like falling asleep. 

I always thought I would die on a surgical table, my body used for research. 

Or burned to ashes in the incinerator. 

Almost death was… cozy. 

*“I'm, like, really freakin’ warm.”*

Ethan’s voice pricked into my mind, and I found myself side by side with him.

He was lying on something ice cold, his wrists strapped down. 

I didn't know what to say, so I rolled onto my back, “Well, I'm pretty sure I'm dying.” 

*“But you're dying in a cool way.”* Ethan chuckled. *“Driving freakin’ Santa's sleigh. That's one hell of a way to go out, right?”*

“Mmm.” I said. “Also, of hypothermia.”

I noticed where we were, sitting up, my head hitting the ceiling. 

Wherever we were was too narrow and claustrophobic. 

“Fuck.” I hissed, kicking the ceiling. “Where are you?”

*“I’d… rather not answer that,”* Ethan said, shooting me a sickly smile. *“Can we just… talk?”*

I pretended not to see the ignition of oranges getting brighter and brighter. 

Closer and closer. 

“Sure.” I said, swallowing a cry. “We can… talk.” 

*""Carlisle escaped today,”* he murmured, after a moment. *“So, expect the world to get a whole lot fucking crazier with her free.”*

Those were words I really did not want to hear. 

Still, though. With Carlisle free, maybe anything was possible. 

The orange blur was growing bigger, and I squeezed my eyes shut. 

I had to wake up, to get out the snow. To live. Because I was going to freeze to death. 

But I didn't want to leave him. 

*“Merry Christmas, J,”* Ethan murmured, his wide smile erupting into raging fire melting the flesh from his bones. *“And happy fucking birthday to me.”*

I thought I was going to die that night. I was ready to die with Ethan. 

Closing my eyes, I waited for the fire to engulf me. 

Before a *flash*. 

Emma had her arms wrapped around me. Her dark hair flew behind her, wide eyes determined. She told me to hold tight. 

I did, and the world around us blurred, my stomach jumping into my throat. 

When I opened my eyes, we were in a random field. 

Emma didn't even look at me. She threw me a coat, a scarf, and told me to “Get a move on.”

Apparently, she used to play in the field as a kid. It was considered her, “Save point.”

It's been a month since I escaped the YWPA.

One month since I stopped asking if Emma saved Ethan too. 

I think I know the answer.

I saw a helicopter yesterday. Unmarked. Which means they're coming after us. 

So far, we’ve been surviving on scraps. Emma wants me to use my power to fuck with people, but I'm not doing it again. 

I'm terrified they're going to take me back there. 

Whatever I did on Christmas Eve, I'm *not* doing it again. 

Emma is weak. Her power can only take us so far. She's already taken me back to ‘Santa's’ base twice. 

There's no sign of Luke, or Tory. 

Which means they've either been disposed of, or are being used. 

According to sources at the YWPA, Ethan died on Christmas Eve. He was executed. 

But there's no trace of him. 

No ashes.

This keeps me up all night. Because I saw him break apart. I saw his skin drip from his bones. I fucking saw Ethan die. 

So, if he's not dead…

In a world where fashion trends shift overnight, true style stands firm. The modern gentleman understands that sophistication doesn’t come from quantity—it’s born from quality, craftsmanship, and purpose. At **La Mode Men’s**, we champion a refined philosophy: a perfect wardrobe can be built with just four timeless essentials.

This guide explores how these four foundational pieces—the **crisp white dress shirt**, **tailored suit**, **classic denim jeans**, and **leather jacket**—can elevate your wardrobe and redefine the way you approach fashion. By focusing on versatility and longevity, you’ll discover how simplicity can unlock endless style possibilities.

# 1. The Crisp White Dress Shirt: The Foundation of Every Gentleman’s Look

Few garments embody timelessness quite like the **white dress shirt**. It’s the cornerstone of a well-rounded wardrobe—a blank canvas that complements every setting and style.

**Versatility at Its Core**  
The beauty of a crisp white dress shirt lies in its ability to adapt. Whether you’re commanding attention in the boardroom, enjoying a casual coffee date, or attending a formal event, this single piece transitions seamlessly. Its clean lines and sharp silhouette create an instant impression of confidence and poise.

**Styling Tips for Every Occasion**

* **Professional Setting:** Pair your white dress shirt with a navy or charcoal tailored suit for a sophisticated, polished look. Add a **patterned silk tie** from La Mode Men’s collection to express individuality.
* **Smart Casual:** Swap the suit for **dark denim jeans** and roll up the sleeves for a relaxed yet refined aesthetic. A **brown belt and loafers** will complete the ensemble with understated elegance.
* **Layering for Personality:** In cooler months, wear your white shirt under a **cashmere sweater** or **leather jacket** for texture and depth. A subtle pocket square can add a touch of flair.

No matter how it’s styled, a high-quality white shirt never fails to impress. It’s the unsung hero of men’s fashion—a piece that bridges every outfit with effortless grace.

# 2. The Timeless Tailored Suit: Confidence in Every Stitch

The **tailored suit** remains the ultimate expression of sophistication and self-assurance. At La Mode Men’s, we believe every man deserves a suit that fits as though it were made exclusively for him.

**The Boardroom Essential**  
A tailored suit communicates confidence before you even speak. Whether in meetings, interviews, or formal gatherings, it sets the tone for success. Opt for neutral tones like **navy, charcoal, or midnight black**—these hues never go out of style and can be worn across multiple occasions.

**Versatility Redefined**  
A modern suit isn’t confined to formality. By **deconstructing the look**, you can transition from professional to casual in seconds.

* Pair the suit jacket with **dark jeans** and a **white dress shirt** for a smart evening out.
* Use the **suit trousers** with a **light knit polo** for a polished business-casual look.
* For a relaxed weekend, wear the **suit jacket** over a **crew-neck tee** and **leather sneakers**.

Each variation speaks to different aspects of your personality while maintaining a core of refinement. A great suit is not just clothing—it’s armor, expression, and legacy all in one.

# 3. Classic Denim Jeans: The Epitome of Effortless Cool

When it comes to versatility, **denim jeans** reign supreme. They bridge the gap between comfort and style, making them an indispensable part of the modern man’s wardrobe.

**Casual Cool for Every Day**  
The right pair of jeans can elevate even the simplest outfit. Choose **dark indigo** or **deep black denim** for a cleaner, more refined look that transitions easily from day to night. These tones pair beautifully with both **dress shirts** and **leather jackets**, making them ideal for nearly any setting.

**How to Dress Them Up or Down**

* **Dressed Up:** Combine dark jeans with a **tailored blazer**, **crisp shirt**, and **oxford shoes**. This balance of casual and formal makes for an effortlessly chic ensemble.
* **Dressed Down:** For weekends, pair jeans with a **fitted T-shirt** or **henley** and **clean sneakers**. Add a **La Mode Men’s leather jacket** to introduce character and edge.
* **Creative Expression:** Don’t hesitate to experiment—cuff the hems, try a monochrome palette, or layer accessories for a personal twist.

Durable, stylish, and endlessly adaptable, jeans are the backbone of smart-casual menswear. They age beautifully, telling your story through every fade and crease.

# 4. The Leather Jacket: A Statement of Confidence

If the white shirt is the foundation and the suit is the framework, the **leather jacket** is the soul of a man’s wardrobe. It embodies character, rebellion, and timeless cool.

**An Icon of Masculine Style**  
From classic aviator designs to minimalist moto cuts, the leather jacket adds personality to any outfit. Its ability to exude confidence without saying a word is unmatched. Whether you’re heading out for a night on the town or layering for an autumn day, a well-fitted leather jacket transforms your entire look.

**Seasonal Adaptability**  
A quality leather jacket is surprisingly versatile across climates:

* **Fall/Winter:** Layer it over a **turtleneck or sweater** for warmth and a sleek silhouette.
* **Spring/Summer:** Wear it open over a **light cotton shirt** or **white tee** to add effortless flair.

Beyond its functionality, the leather jacket tells a story—it’s a piece that matures with you, acquiring character and patina over time. It’s not just an outer layer; it’s a symbol of independence and enduring taste.

# Building Your Capsule Wardrobe: Less, but Better

What makes these four pieces so powerful is their ability to complement one another. A **white dress shirt** can pair with **jeans, a suit, or under a leather jacket**. A **tailored suit jacket** works just as well with **denim** as it does with matching trousers. Every item interacts harmoniously, allowing for dozens of outfit combinations without cluttering your closet.

This minimalist approach—often called a **capsule wardrobe**—saves time, reduces decision fatigue, and ensures that every garment you own adds real value. It’s fashion with purpose: simple, elegant, and sustainable.

# Why Quality Matters

La Mode Men’s is built on the belief that quality craftsmanship never goes out of style. Investing in fewer, better pieces doesn’t just elevate your look—it saves you money in the long run. High-quality fabrics, expert tailoring, and attention to detail ensure that each piece maintains its shape, texture, and integrity for years to come.

Our curated collection emphasizes **durability, comfort, and timeless aesthetics**, allowing every man to embody sophistication without excess. Fashion fades, but quality endures.

# Conclusion: Elevate Your Everyday with Purpose

In the pursuit of true style, **simplicity is power**. With just four essential pieces—the crisp white dress shirt, the timeless tailored suit, the classic denim jeans, and the iconic leather jacket—you can craft a wardrobe that exudes confidence, versatility, and sophistication.

At[ **La Mode Men’s**](https://lamodemensclothing.com/), we invite you to embrace the essence of refined minimalism. Each garment we design is a testament to craftsmanship, individuality, and the modern gentleman’s pursuit of excellence.

Elevate your wardrobe. Embrace quality over quantity. Redefine what it means to dress well—with purpose, passion, and timeless class.

1o0ebh8,https://i.redd.it/wx7qr50evotf1.jpeg,Time consumption and GoMining,"

Well how do you use your time with the app?
If you are in Miner Wars or/ and doing “the tasks” then you are putting some time into it.

Ill give an example of my daily day use on average:

I usually get up at 06:30 am to prepare children for kindergarten but of course first thing is to look at the app, even though i know my service button isn’t due till 2 hours later, i have to look lol just in case… thats how it is when you are hooked!


I used to be in Miner Wars up until now (temporarily now in solo) so of course while drinking coffee at home before going out you look to see if you got hopefully any passive blocks during the night and to see how your clan did, who boosted and when was it busy…
That takes at least 5-10 min of your time

You do check your clan chat as most clans have chats if on discord, telegram or somewhere else
So just to be up to date with the clans info
( and dont get me started of reading all the laughable things said during the night when you slept lol- that can take a chunk of your  time!) 
After putting kids in school or kindergarten time to go to work!

I usually come a bit early so i can have the time to relax with a second cup of coffee, and because i know that during work time it can be very busy, i tend to sit and chat in telegram… of course there is the task program of 10 messages a day even though i know that shouldn’t be a problem completing because i am a chatty guy and i do like to read what people write on telegram and i love helping or sharing info when i can or know. 
Telegram task can take you 5 min if you want to message like a bot and be annoying lol, just typing “GoMining is the best” what everyone knows anyway cause its a GoMining chat🙄 or you can be thoughtful and help others but need to wait for the questions to answer. 

Now we do have the reddit task each task cycle (we are here right? Lmao) and it was time consuming getting there to 8k karma and if you ask me they will raise that bar to a higher karma lvl in the future as more and more get to 8k
I do tend to write my post for reddit days before when i have spare time and usually not at work hours…(getting to 8k karma took me about 3 weeks all together when i went for it, mostly done in the last 2)

And x platform task… well to like and repost and write a sentence doesn’t really take much time from you, but to raise or even get a tweetscore for a higher paid x task? 
Well thats a different story! Many try for a long time by posting reposting and connecting with people and still don’t manage to raise the bar 
At one point i became a “reply guy”, a term that means that you reply to any post the big guys send, but that too much of time consuming, way too much of time i dont have..
 (the trick is as many suggested, to follow a big x member, one that has a lot of followers, an influencer, and to get him to like or even comment in your post or comment)

I do try to sneak usage time in x or reddit when i can at work and i do like here and there to look at the secondary market place to see if there is a cheap miner deal to steal but i cant be too glued to phone lol and i think that is a good thing for your soul!! Haha

We used to have a quest of a telegram quiz!
(Still have here and there but its rarer)
One of the best times a day on telegram used to be a good time to talk to people, banter and have fun and on the way maybe win a question which gives you points towards the task…

Of course when i get back home hopefully all the tasks for that day are done, i do like to have time with wife without phone usage even though she is hooked her own self too like me on GoMining lol 

If you read all this you can see i am addicted to my phone because all around the day i am trying to sneak a peek lol
It used to be even worse before i knew GoMining were i used to play dumb games that didn’t get me anywhere and at least now i am doing something productive (i do other apps with tasks but GoMining is my main app) ",3,1759842536.0,gomining,2,1.0,False

I have discussed with my own doctor who I trust and I do not want your unsolicited advice on why I shouldn't be doing this. Thanks!

Back in 2020, I was diagnosed with non-Hashimoto's hypothyroidism and was put on a 50mcg once a day dose of Levothyroxine. Everything seemed to be great, at least on the thyroid front. I've attempted carnivore exactly 3 times since (my doc is aware and is totally on board with it). The first time, I think I lasted about 3 months, The second time was short, maybe a week. And this current time, I am on day 17. The one thing all 3 attempts have had in common is extremely dry mouth. Like, an absolute desert. It wakes me up in the middle of the night and my throat even feels like it sticks shut when I swallow sometimes because it gets so dry and sticky. I also feel like I have mucus that has formed right back at the top back of my mouth (think uvula area) and just hangs there. Sometimes I can hack it up, sometimes I cant.  I see ""you probably have an electrolyte issue"" all over the internet, which is extremely unhelpful because it doesn't speak to which one might be too high or too low, it kinda just says ""figure it out yourself."" Either way, I think I can rule that out, I salt EVERYTHING and I'm pretty strict (steak, ground beef, bacon, eggs, sausage, pork chops, butter, ghee, bone broth. zero caffeine, coffee, or alcohol. only water.), I drink multiple large Stanley cups of water throughout the day. I've used Keto Chow daily minerals, SALTT mineral drops, and now using LMNT unflavored, I really don't think it's an electrolyte issue because I'm getting enough of everything. Mouth breathing.... doesn't seem like the culprit because why the problem now but never when I was eating standard American & processed junk? I just ordered one of those headbands that keeps your jaw shut just to try it out, but I'm not optimistic. 

Which leads me to my current hypothesis - thyroid medication. Granted, it's only day 17, but I'm not sure if maybe the dose is now too high (I know it's pretty low already as far as levo goes) in the absence of carbohydrates and water retention, or if by cutting out processed junk, carbs and high oxalate foods is my thyroid function returning and thus causing me to have too much thyroid hormone circulating in my body and affecting my saliva production?

1o0eah8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1o0eah8/my_neighbor_copies_everything_i_do/,My neighbor copies everything I do,"I hadn’t noticed it before the traveling glass-eye salesman pointed it out.

“Freaky,” he said, nodding toward the house across the street. “Your houses are nearly *identical*.”

I turned the glass eye over in my hand. “I guess, maybe.”

“You want it?”

I shook my head.

“Got one to sell, then?”

“No.”

He handed me a card. “Well, if you ever need one, or come across a phony peeper to pawn, you let me know.”

I mumbled goodbye and closed the door. Then I just stood there, staring at the business card for what must’ve been five minutes. A strange unease crept in. Coffee usually helped.

From the kitchen window, I watched the salesman leave the neighbor’s house. That’s when I started noticing things I’d somehow ignored.

Damn. They really *are* identical.

Same color, same shape, same cracked driveway. Even the juniper bushes were planted in the exact same spots. The lawn; wild, overgrown, weedy. Just like mine. Even the rust stain under the basketball hoop matched perfectly.

Had I ever met the neighbor? Was that house always there?

Lost in thought, I almost missed it: someone watching me from the window across the street.

“Shit.” I ducked behind the curtain.

Over the next few days, things got stranger. The guy always checked the mailbox right after me. He waved the same way: four fingers in the air, my usual half-hearted greeting. And those stares… always at odd hours. Early mornings. Late nights. Somehow though, I could never really get a good look at him.

Coincidence, I told myself. Nothing else to it.

To test it, I stopped by one morning after my jog. I rang the doorbell a dozen times. No answer. I shrugged, went home, and hit the shower. Then my own doorbell rang. A dozen times. I hurried to get out, but couldn’t reach it in time.

A cold chill slid through me.

That night, I dug out an old webcam from a box. Not exactly surveillance gear, but it’d do. In the dark garage I tripped over the stepladder, got tangled in some rope, but managed to mount the camera above the garage door.

I set up the feed and waited. One minute. Two. Three. Four.

And there he was, stumbling out of his garage, mounting a camera above *his* door.

The image was grainy, but I finally got a clear look at the man, and…

It was just some guy. Not identical to me in any way. Not even similar.

So what is it? Is he copying me? Or am I somehow controlling him, pulling his strings five minutes ahead?

It doesn’t matter. The stepladder is ready. The rope too.

Maybe he’s like me: lonely, depressed, done with it all. Maybe not.

I wonder if he’s waiting for his cue. Maybe he’s standing in his garage, hand on the same rope.

I climb the ladder, heart steady, palms slick on the rungs.

Somewhere across the street, I know he’s preparing to do the same.",27,1759842466.0,shortscarystories,6,0.97,False

1o0e9vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1o0e9vn/a_journal_entry_about_the_worst_breakup_of_my_life/,A Journal Entry about the worst breakup of my life.,"I just wanted to share this. It feels cathartic, to post this anonymously on the internet. I hope if you’re going through a breakup you’ll be kind to yourself and take care. Writing this helped me immensely. Here it is:


I realized I think a greater reason why I may be scared of dating again. 

Because when my ex girlfriend broke up with me, there was no explanation. There was no feeling of the feelings fading on my end, or her end, she just would fight with me, and we would make up. My complete understanding of our relationship went from “you would be a great father. I want your babies.” To “get away from me, forever” and that broke my reality. 

Not because I invented those quotes. Because she said them to me and showed me them with her actions. Both. And never told me that she was thinking about other people. Or that she wanted more from me. Or that she was straying from me. I just slowly became paranoid about the evidence she tried to hide.

My understanding of my own reality, and who I was in it was flipped on its head 180 degrees in 2 hours. 

She broke up with me at 1, in time for her train to the airport at 3. 

And that morning, she gave me a blowjob, swallowed my cum for the first time, and said “I liked it”. Talk about mixed messages.

She didn’t know what she did to me, but she felt it. Looking back, I don’t know how I wouldn’t done it. You told this man he’s the father of your children, and then didn’t ever really say you were losing feelings. Why? Because it’s hard. But I was worth that.

And I was a puddle, trying to find any crack in the earth to seep into so I wouldn’t exist anymore, screaming. Because I had never felt so much pain and I wanted to get it out. 

Maybe if I screamed it would leave me. Like a wounded animal. But it didn’t. It just made it more real. 

You know the same part of your brain that feels emotional pain is the same part of your brain that feels physical pain right?

I felt utterly out of control of my reality.

And she felt a little bad, so she agreed to “allow me to fly to Germany for a week” so she could fight with me for a week, and tell me such gems as 

“I don’t want to take accountability” 
And 
“You need to get a new psychologist because this one’s not working”

This was the woman who I wanted to be my wife. Because she has a soft, beautiful side, and she’s gorgeous obviously. 

But that’s just a side that she shows people she’s manipulating. Keeping them in the reality that she feels safe with them in. By telling lies like 

“none of my male friends have ever flirted with me. In my whole life” 

And thinking I’d believe it. 

I saw a little bit of who she was

Sending 😉 in texts to her male roommate who waits on her every morning like a labradoodle, so he can be in her aura for a moment.

Replying to guys she used to fuck in the comments of her instagram posts. 

And their DMS. Of “I miss you” and “cutie”

And claiming she’s been loyal the whole time. 

Why did I trust this person with my soul. My heart wasn’t just broken. It was precisely shattered. Stamped on. Expertly used for maximum energy. 

By someone who saw me as a resource, not a lover. A resource for good feelings, that they could abandon at any moment.

Upon the fourth read through of my recounting of my devastation, I’ve left out the aftermath. 

She easily moved on, fucking a guy within a month and another one the next month. The second guy introduced her to BDSM and filmed their pickup and posted it online. She still preferred him over me. That’s how low she viewed me.

Now she doesn’t think of me. No happy birthday text. Not looking at my stories. I’m sure she’s with someone “better.” 

And I’m left here trying to become enough for someone I will never be enough for. Not because I’m not enough. Just because it’s me. 

And that continues to hurt. Because I continue to want her.

And this pain goes unheard, unseen. Except for by the psychologist who she told me wasn’t working for me, in a room with no one else listening. 

It feels unfair. Something she used to say often. 

Unfair that she’s unaware that I haven’t stopped thinking about her or loving her. 

Unfair that I wear it like a badge of honor. 

Unfair that I don’t want to date anymore while she explores and is getting explored.

Unfair that I’ve twisted my self worth into a tether of shame that keeps pulling me into that crack I seeped into. Seemingly no matter how hard I try to crawl out. I need it to overflow with rain from the heavens. That way I can swim out. 

All I can do is write in my notes app. In my digital notebook.  

And ask the question.

Where do I go from here. 
Why do I seem to want success, but not that much.
Why am I only doing 60% of things right. 
Why do I feel so alone, when I have friends and family that care. 
Why any of it. 

As I write this, “let go” by Girls of the internet is playing at the coffee shop. 

Letting go is a process. And doesn’t happen all at once. So what am I letting go of.

Letting go of needing her to care about me. Letting go of needing her to love me.
Letting go of needing her to live her life in a certain way. 

Letting go of my life needing to go in a certain way.
Letting go of people I love.
And letting them be.

So that I can.

Be. Me.

1o0e8am,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1o0e8am/experience_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_with/,Experience the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker with Hario PDA-02-T,"The Hario PDA-02-T, known as the Hario V60 Drip-Assist, quickly became a staple in my daily coffee routine. As someone who appreciates a good pour-over coffee but doesn’t always appreciate the fuss of specialized equipment, this simple yet effective device caught my attention. A clear manual drip coffee maker designed for personal use, it promises ease, consistency, and versatility. After several runs with it, I have both praise and critiques to share. Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty.

**Design and Build**  
The compact and lightweight build of the coffee maker makes it ideal for small kitchens or even a quick on-the-go setup. Its clear finish, paired with a matte exterior, is aesthetically minimalistic while still feeling clean and premium. Measuring 10.92 inches in both depth and width with a height of just under five inches, it’s perfectly sized for a countertop or to stash in a cupboard. It’s entirely manual, which made me feel like I was in control every step of the brewing process. The reusable filter is a genius touch—not only am I saving money on disposable filters, but I’m also doing a small part for sustainability.  

**Positives**  
A few key benefits stood out during my use:  
- The device simplifies the pour-over coffee experience with its drip-assist feature, ensuring consistency even when you’re half asleep.  
- There’s no longer a need for a gooseneck kettle. Hot water evenly flows through its multi-sized holes, delivering a steady stream over the coffee grounds.  
- It includes simple instructions, such as pouring precise amounts of water into the center and outer rings, which makes the process nearly foolproof.

**Ease of Use**  
If you’ve ever struggled with achieving the perfect spiral pour—which is notorious among pour-over enthusiasts—this product solves that dilemma. The Drip-Assist attachment provides even water flow, and I never had to worry about over-pouring or uneven saturation of the coffee grounds. The first time I used it, I pulled off a rich, perfectly balanced cup of coffee without stress. Beginners will fall in love with how unintimidating this makes brewing. Even my sleep-deprived coworker picked it up and got professional results!

**Features That Stand Out**  
One thing I noticed is the clever design of the drip system. Its inner and outer rings manage the water distribution brilliantly—the water in the inner circle flows at a slightly slower rate while water in the outer ring evenly soaks the edges of the coffee bed. I was also impressed by how intuitive the entire setup was. There’s no messing around with complex timers or gadgets, adding to its charm. The device is self-explanatory, relying on thoughtful engineering rather than fancy bells or whistles.  

**Drawbacks**  
Though incredibly functional, there are a few areas for improvement:  
- It requires precise water measurements. If you’re not willing to use a scale or measuring container, you might not achieve consistent results.  
- The clear finish, while sleek, shows smudges and stains more easily than I’d like; a quick wipe is needed after use.  
- The manual operation means there’s no automation, which might not appeal to everyone, especially for big “batch brews.”  

**Other Options**  
When comparing the product to direct competitors, the Kalita Wave and Chemex come to mind. Both are iconic in the pour-over coffee space, but their demands for a specific pouring technique and gooseneck kettles can make them less user-friendly for beginners. In contrast, this coffee maker simplifies the process with its drip-assist mechanism while maintaining the high-quality coffee output. However, those seeking larger brewing capacity might lean toward Chemex since it handles multi-cup brewing better. Kalita Wave, meanwhile, offers a consistent but slightly punchier flavor profile, giving it an edge for those who prioritize taste intricacies. The Hario PDA-02-T remains an ideal pick for simplicity and accessibility.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
For its price point, this coffee maker gives a strong performance. It bridges the gap between traditional pour-over systems and semi-automated ones, making it an excellent investment for beginners or anyone wanting a reliable single-cup brewing experience. It’s budget-friendly while boasting long-term usability with its reusable filter and minimal maintenance requirements. The value proposition is undeniable, especially for coffee enthusiasts who appreciate a more hands-on process without breaking the bank.

Anonymous/throwaway account for privacy. I'm looking for help and advice.

I'm still processing some serious events and conversations that have happened over the last few days with my wife. I am sure that my account is going to be inaccurate and incomplete and I am sad about that. And scared because I am not trying to dodge accountability, but I don't have the best memory, especially in stressful situations. We have been struggling with deep issues for a long time. I have a problem with anxiety and anxious attachment. She struggles with depression and other trauma.

On Wednesday we celebrated our anniversary as a couple and things felt to me connected and close and loving. She gave me gifts she had brought back from a solo trip to Colombia. We went out to a nice dinner, to drinks, we danced and sang and I read her a poem that I had wrote for her. Things felt intimate and loving and real.

On Thursday we had a large fight about me moving my things out of her apartment. I am still so confused and hurt by this, and hurt even more because she was and is so hurt by me, so I apologize if this account seems scattered. I am not trying to dodge accountability or responsibility. In some ways, I feel like an idiot. In some ways I am afraid I was using leaving my things at her place as a way to seek connection and security and that it was using her. She had told me the other day when she returned from Colombia that I didn't do a good job packing up my things and had left the room looking like I had just gone away to college instead of looking like the room was a guest room. I apologized to her and I thought I understood what she wanted, which was to have my things packed up further. And I didn't have everything packed away at first. I had some clothes hanging in the closet, I had other clothes folded and out away in the closet, I had coffee supplies of mine put away in the closet, I had a desk in the corner, I had some small figurines set up on the nightstand. When I first left, I only took what I needed for my Airbnb. We had had an agreement that I could store my things at her place while I was away. But according to her this was only for the period while I was travelling with her to Europe and not while I was staying at an Airbnb. And that may be true, I am not sure, I don't know what is true right now.

On Thursday afternoon, after telling her on Wednesday I would contact her Thursday to come over to her place and pack up my things, I emailed her around 2 and asked about doing so. She was hurt and angry that I didn't contact her sooner. I went over to her place around 3 and we had a long discussion where she explained she was very hurt and angry that I didn't reach out sooner that day and that I didn't have my things already packed. I then went into the guest rooms and packed up my things and put them into bags and suitcases and out then away in the closet. I then asked her if how I had them packed up was acceptable and I also asked if I could leave my passport and some credit cards at her place instead of taking them to the Airbnb I was staying at. This very much upset her and she felt betrayed by me and told me I had to move all my shit out and anything I left was for her to burn. She told me I was using her and that I was emotionally abusive. That shocks and frightens me and I am scared that I might be? We had another long talk and argument wherein she told me I was emotionally abusive and that I should look her in the eyes and be honest and admit it. And I was scared and confused and I did so. And then she told me there were things I needed to do, which were to read a book on abusers 'Why does he do it?' by Lundy Bancroft. I had to find a local psychiatrist to be evaluated and get medical treatment, in addition to the individual therapy which I am already undergoing. And I had to undergo magic mushrooms treatment, which is something that I also had been talking about doing for myself but had been delaying out of fear of the potential negative impacts. In the course of this, she also told me that she had not been paying her taxes for the last ten years and had been concealing that from me. She later told me that she wasn't sure why she told me that, whether it was to finally come clean about it or whether she wanted to hurt me. We talked about darker times in our lives. There was that period after her mother's death where she was acutely suicidal, and for a long while after that period she was deeply depressed and told me constantly how there was no point to life and that we would never find happiness and would just be better off dead. This was while we were struggling to find a new home after losing everything. She told me that night during our argument that she told me all that dark stuff for those years because she loved me, and that what she was really thinking about all that time was killing herself, but she kept it from me to protect me and because she didn't believe I could handle the honesty.  I felt and feel so sad for her, and sad for being kept away from the truth, too.

On Friday, I underwent psilocybin and it was a deep and profound experience during which I feel as if I died several times. I felt a deeper connection to the world. I feel I learned something profound about connection, choices, honesty, accountability. It fundamentally changed me.

Since Friday, I have been reading 'Why does he do that?' and trying to see myself in those men described in the book. But it is hard and I do not know if that is my ego and resistance at being called out, or if it is truthful. She says that dealing with my shit and my problems is the reason she isn't able to work on her own problems. I do not want to control her. I try to encourage her to grow as a person. To value and love herself. I try to encourage her to develop friendships, to start and grow her own business, to write the novel she has been trying to write, to learn and travel and explore on her own. I have trusted her implicitly in what she does and where she goes and travels and have not tried to change her or stop her from traveling anywhere. But I have been afraid and have made choices where I have clung to her or sought security with and from her and that may be using her. There is a huge disparity in our financial resources, with her having far, far more money than I do. And that causes me to feel insecure and afraid.  I own that. Those were choices I made and actions I did. I hate that it has caused her pain.  That I have caused her pain. i have been by her side through times she has been suicidal and alcoholic and even with her revelation to me about taxes and lying about them for ten years, I feel more hurt for her and the pain that she is in more than anything else.  But I can't discount what she has told me about being an abuser. That is serious. 

There are other things:
Earlier this year, we had a trip planned. We had an argument before while I was travelling in a different city. I had not properly washed a cutting board before putting it away and ants came into our apartment. Additionally, I had not tied shut very well a bag of oatmeal and ants got into that and while she was trying to clean it, the bag opened and spilled into the sink. When she tried to wash it away, the oatmeal got into the drain and clogged it for several days. I was told it was all my fault and called a toddler, lazy, and incompetent. She told me that she wasn't stopping me from going on the trip, but she would not be communicating with me if I did, and that she would prefer if I just gave her all the hotel reservations. Including some very expensive ones I paid for. I could go, but I would be punished, or I could be punished by not going on the trip and giving her money in the form of the reservations. This also came along with the implied threat of divorce if I waited too long to answer her request.

Additionally in that trip to this other city, she told me that I was not staying away long enough. I was away six nights when we had previously discussed a week because she knows our financial circumstances are far different and she has way more money than I do. However, before I went on this trip, I emailed her and asked her if it was okay that i go for six nights instead because of financial constraints. She said not only was that okay, she thanked me for asking her.

Then she sent me this, after the incident of the cutting board and drain clogging:

[5/8, 14:45] Her: This was just too fucking unfair. All of it. You will need to find a way to be gone from the apartment until a later date, I haven't decided yet when. It wasn't the fucking ants- it was you. You never had any right to fucking ask me if it was okay to be 6 days instead of the goddamn week I asked for to begin with anyway. You are being such a fucking asshole.

[5/8, 14:58] Her: It is just so fundamentally unfair and you are continuing to be so, so selfish, and lazy. I don't want to live with a lazy, selfish person. And to learn that you are so selfish that I can't even get to have the half of the space of the apartment for myself when you're not even here due to your extraordinary selfishness is just so unfair. That's not sharing the apartment, that's you having the apartment and me putting up with your selfishness and laziness.[

5/8, 14:59] Her: You got to have the apartment as a space for yourself when I was away, but now that you're gone, I don't even get to have it in the same way due to your selfish choices is not remotely equal.

[5/8, 15:07] Her: I don't know if I can do this anymore. I don't want to be abusive, and I don't want to be an abuser, but I don't know how else to continue to deal with a User, which is what you are.[5/8, 22:32] Her: Also, I am telling you this because of the fact that I have not decided on divorce yet, but there always is some cost to waiting, that's not some threat with a plan. That's life.

In February, she kicked me out of our apartment for a while. I was out donating some of our things to a charity and told her I would be at a cafe working. She messaged me while I was at the cafe telling me to come to the apartment immediately. I told her I needed a few minutes. She responded that 'wow, what I was doing was more important than our marriage.' I got the bill, used the bathroom because I was freaking out, and it took me 7 to 10 minutes to get home. She told me that she wanted me to stay in a hotel, and that originally she was only panning to ask me to stay out for a couple nights, but because I 'took so long' she wanted a full week. That full week became three.

The latest market data shows a significant shift in power towards buyers. With **21 out of every 100 new listings being pulled from the market** this summer without a sale, sellers can no longer rely on momentum alone. Every detail matters, and one of the most overlooked is sensory staging—specifically, scent.

While it seems like a ""soft"" skill, the strategic use of scent during showings is rooted in science and can have a tangible impact on a buyer's perception of value.



# The Psychology: Why Scent Sells



As a real estate agent with **Vision Realty**, we coach clients that buying a home is an emotional decision justified by logic. Scent bypasses logic.

* **The Brain Science:** Smell is the only sense that connects directly to the **amygdala and hippocampus**—the brain's centers for emotion and memory. A pleasant, nostalgic scent can create an immediate, subconscious positive association with a property before a buyer even processes the room's dimensions.
* **The Goal:** The aim is to make a house feel like a ""home."" This emotional connection makes buyers more likely to overlook minor flaws and more inclined to picture themselves living there, leading to stronger, faster offers.



# The ROI: Risk Mitigation and Deal Protection



The financial return of baking cookies isn't something you can easily quantify on a spreadsheet. Instead, think of it as a crucial risk-mitigation tool.

* **The ""DOs"" (Positive ROI):**
   * **Neutralize First:** The highest ROI comes from eliminating negative odors. Deep clean carpets, repaint if necessary, and address any pet or mildew smells. A neutral base is non-negotiable.
   * **Use Natural Scents:** Bake something simple (bread, a simple cake), brew coffee, or simmer spices. These scents are perceived as authentic and welcoming.
* **The ""DON'Ts"" (Negative ROI):**
   * **Artificial Overload:** Overpowering plug-ins, sprays, or candles are a massive red flag. Buyers often assume you're hiding a serious problem (mold, smoke damage) and will either scrutinize the inspection report or walk away entirely.
   * **Wrong Scent, Wrong House:** As one agent noted, a cheap cinnamon candle in a multi-million dollar home feels discordant and can break the sense of luxury. The scent must match the home's character.

In a market where **21% of sellers are failing**, mastering these ""soft"" details can be the critical difference between closing the deal and becoming another delisted statistic.

I've now had two short-term/3 month stays in Japan (Tokyo), and I found that both of my rental apartments were lacking in things that I would have expected to find - or would have liked to have found - in my apartment. (Mind you, both of these apartments were rented thru an agency that caters to foreigners, and the apartments are in very nice parts of Tokyo, and weren't exactly 'inexpensive'....)  These few small items (see my list, further down, below) really helped me to feel more 'at home' and functional, in my apartment. So for anyone out there who may also be planning to live in Japan, short-term, here's my list of items. Of course, some of these items weren't so much 'functional', as much as...they simply helped my apartment to feel more 'homey' and personalized.

* scissors (you'd be surprised, how many times you may need scissors)
* a supply of various-sized food storage containers (helpful after you've cut-up just half an avocado, etc and for leftovers etc..)
* a good amount of baggie clips (to help snacks, opened bags of dry pasta, etc. to stay fresh)
* potholders
* small hand towel for kitchen
* if you like coffee first thing in the morning, you can buy a cheap French press at IKEA (or else a drip-coffee machine, somewhere...). *While both my apartments had electric kettles, neither had anything to make a proper cup of coffee...*
* can opener
* jar opener
* a small table clock (unless - unlike me - you don't mind having to constantly pick up your phone, to see what time it is...)
* soap dishes (both apartment showers only had solid trays - with NO drainage - to hold my various bars of wet soaps. I have solid soap/bar forms of shampoo and conditioner, in addition to body soap, so they need to be able to drain/dry off, after a shower. MUJI has great soap trays, with a 'sponge' that sits atop the tray, ensuring that your soap bars don't turn to mushy gunk..)
* night light
* a few magnets for the fridge, to hold front-and-center type papers (i..e, I find that a copy of the [Tokyo Metro Map](https://www.tokyometro.jp/library_in/en/subwaymap/pdf/rosen_en_1803.pdf) \- printed in Color is invaluable, for when I'm planning my day, and before I leave my apartment. I refer to the map, and trace along the lines, to figure out which trains I'm going to take...where I'll make my connections...and then I send a quick note/email to myself with those details. Then, once I'm out and about, if I need further confirmation, I can refer to the map, from my phone. But I find that initially doing all of this via a printed, Color copy of the map, is far more effective vs doing it via a small phone screen....)

BTW, I either ordered these items for delivery from [Amazon.co.jo](http://amazon.co.jo/), or else I bought them at a local Daiso ('dollar store') or at IKEA or Muji, while other items I got for free, from local folks on the [Mottainai Japan](https://www.facebook.com/share/g/1JTMoopTdp/Mottainai) Facebook Group. Once I'm again preparing to leave Japan, I will either sell (or offer up for Free) these items, via that same FB group.",1,1759842191.0,digitalnomadlife,0,1.0,False
1o0e6jw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0e6jw,Wing & Instinct Help,"I have narrowed my type down to 7 due to my avoidance of personal negative emotions and my excessive amounts of planning ahead I do in my head to account for everything, but I don't know what wing I would have. I know wings aren't that important for the Enneagram, and not even a part of the original theory, but I am just curious. I also have struggled with finding my instinct, I feel like I am oddly balanced, but I will take other opinions. I will also provide art boards that I made that have pieces that I particularly liked from Pinterest.

Typology: ENTP ILE

My Hobbies: Generally, I am busy surfing the internet, looking for topics to attach to what I already know. I love finding the connections between different ideas, like how Nietzsche's writings can relate to economics, or coming up with theories on how to make artificial body parts, like arms or eyes. I like watching people and writing their possible typologies in my notebook dedicated to typology. I like reading about philosophy and actually am a philosophy major in college currently. I have particularly enjoyed Bertrand Russell's Skepticism and David Hume. 

My Fears: I'm not really horrified by anything, actually loving art and theatrics that have body horror, death, or immense bodily damage.  The thing I am most horrified by is probably my own death, but I have gotten past it slightly. I relate most to Orochimaru from Naruto in the fact that I am scared that my life would go to waste if I didn't live for long enough to make a greater contribution. That is why I don't mind looking at ideas that push the boundaries of what is ethical. I would love to have a robot body, have enhancements that would make me live for longer, or have a technique like Kenjaku from JJK where I could body hop. I just want to live for longer so I can learn as much as I want from the world around me. Besides that fear, I am mildly socially anxious. Going along with my planning problem, I try to predict conversations for roughly 3 ""back and forths"" ahead. I like to plan what I will say ahead of time so that I don't mess it up.

Pet Peeves: I don't really have too many pet peeves, but the ones I do have impact me heavily. First, I despise being touched without permission. The only people I like touching me without me openly allowing them to are family. Even my friends aren't really allowed to touch me, or when they do I recoil for no reason, maybe its because I fantasize about physical contact is for those who are family or intimate, which I struggle to apply the family tag outside of anyone who is actual, blood family. Second, people who don't have justification for their actions. I can't understand someone doing something because they ""felt like it"" I literally can't comprehend it. I think so much that I have a general reason for everything that I do or believe, and if I don't, it's probably one of the few things I haven't thought about.

Other Interests: This is a general section that is meant to highlight things that aren't as important as the parts in the first section. I have working knowledge in most things. Specifically, Mathematics (up to \~Calc 2), Physics, Chem., Anatomy & Biology (prefer Biology), Psychology (beyond just personality types), Sociology (I enjoy seeing how different perspectives can reveal pieces of society), Political Science (my Grandpa is the mayor of my home town, so I got a rough introduction early), Political Philosophy (I collect controversial books because I like making people angry, and they make for fun conversation with open minded people), Technology (I despise coding, everything else is fine), etc (I can't think of anything else).

Approach to Conflict: I really, really, REALLY like to avoid unnecessary conflict unless I am unimpressed with someone's actions. 

\--Example 1. My sister and I got into a fight a while ago where, I think, it was about her getting ready to go hang out with friends and she wanted me to return a book for her to the library. I refused because I wanted to stay at home researching random stuff on my laptop and it would be easier for her to just do it because she was already going out. Eventually, it escalated to insults, then she slapped me and my internal dialogue went, ""I won't hit my sister, I won't lower myself to her level and hit her, and it would get me in trouble with my parents, and I am a large guy, I would do more damage to her. But I really need to hit something now because I am angry."" Then I looked at my sister and said ""Okay, you hit me, I get to break something in your room,"" she said, ""No,"" I said, ""Yes,"" she said, ""No,"" then I stayed silent as I stood up, ready to break something. She ran to her room (less than 3 feet away from my door) and closed the door. I barely take a step out of my door and I swing my arm just to knock on the door to get her to open it... and I accidentally punched a whole into the door. Once our parents got home, we apologized to each other and my sister didn't get to go hang out with her friends and I had to return the book.

\--Example 2. Okay, preface: I have generally gotten along with my step-grandmother, but the majority of my family does not like her. Recently she tried to say that she was working on deciding my sister's future. My sister has been thinking of going into Cosmetology (Cosmetics) for a few years now and my father, mother, and I have known about this and supported her completely because she is really good with make-up and nails. Our Step-Grandmother tried to approach her and have a conversation with her saying, ""Your father and I have been talking about your future, and I think it would be a good path for you to become a paralegal."" My sister already doesn't like her because during a Christmas with her side of the family, our step-gma said, to my sister's and father's face, ""Oh, those presents aren't for you because you aren't my real grandchildren."" So, when my sister got stuck in the conversation with her about her ""future,"" she just walked away without replying, going back home. So, when I heard about this from my sister, it was a week out from when I was gonna visit my family again after my first 6 weeks in college. I fantasized and planned thousands of different comebacks for an argument with my Step-Gma. Finally, the point of this paragraph, it was during breakfast on a Sunday at a restaurant where we go all the time when I still lived at home. The waiter came around and asked us what drinks we would like and most people ordered coffee, but I ordered hot-chocolate to treat myself. There were already mugs at the table to flip over for drinks. I flip over my mug, but the Step-Gma flips it back over so it's down. I flip it back over and she says, ""When you flip over the mug, it means you want coffee,"" then she flips it back upside down. I flip it back over and say, ""Well, they come in the same cup, it makes no difference."" I feel myself tense up in aggravation, but the conflict doesn't go any farther than that and we actually have a decent conversation.

\--Example 3. Finally, this one will be shorter, I just want to say that those are the last 2 times I've had any ""serious"" conflict. I really don't like needlessly arguing with people. I think that it ruins the mood for everyone when arguments happen, so I just avoid them if I deem them unnecessary. I have never argued with a teacher because I always found ways around what they said where I got what I wanted, but still conformed slightly to what they wanted. I also bent rules so much, I technically did things that I should've gotten in trouble for, but I was either just okay enough that they allowed it, or it was my good reputation that got me out, either way, I don't like unnecessary conflict.",2,1759842183.0,EnneagramTypeMe,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

1o0e5ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1o0e5ww/many_different_alternatives_to_y_in_spanish_for/,Many different alternatives to “Y” in Spanish for addition,"The most common connector for adding information in Spanish is, of course, “y” (and), but sometimes it gets boring to use only that one. So here I’ve listed a variety of different alternatives that can make your speech and writing more diverse and expressive.

1 . Simple “also / plus”

* también — also. Vino Juan; también Marta. → Juan came; Marta did too.
* además — besides / furthermore. Es barato; además, útil. → It’s cheap; moreover, it’s useful.
* asimismo — likewise (formal-neutral). El informe es claro; asimismo, conciso. → The report is clear; likewise, concise.
* igualmente / de igual modo/manera — likewise. Ella ayudó; igualmente él. → She helped; he did too.
* incluso / hasta — even (adds surprise). Fueron todos, incluso Ana. / Hasta Ana fue. → Everyone went, even Ana.
* es más / más aún — what’s more / even more. Es caro; es más, subirá. → It’s expensive; what’s more, it will go up.
* aparte — besides (colloquial-neutral). No tengo tiempo; aparte, estoy cansado. → I don’t have time; besides, I’m tired.
* adicionalmente — additionally (formal). Hubo retrasos; adicionalmente, costes extra. → There were delays; additionally, extra costs.
* encima — on top of that (often negative). Llegó tarde y, encima, sin disculparse. → He arrived late and, on top of that, didn’t apologize.

2 . With nouns / infinitives

* además de + N/inf. — besides / in addition to. Además de estudiar, trabaja. → Besides studying, he works.
* aparte de + N/inf. — apart from / besides. Aparte de inglés, habla francés. → Apart from English, he speaks French.
* así como + N/inf. — as well as. Ofrecen café, así como té. → They offer coffee, as well as tea.
* junto con + N — together with. Presentó el DNI junto con el pasaporte. → He presented his ID together with his passport.
* sumado a + N — added to / together with. La lluvia, sumado a el viento, complicó todo. → The rain, together with the wind, made everything harder.

3 . Correlatives (X as well as Y)

* no solo…, sino también… — not only…, but also…  No solo estudia, sino también trabaja. → She not only studies but also works.
* tanto… como… — both… and…  Tanto alumnos como profesores participaron. → Both students and teachers participated.
* ya no solo…, sino también… — not just…, but also…   Ya no solo vende productos, sino también ofrece servicios. → It no longer just sells products, but also offers services.

4 . Discourse adders (new point, same side)

* por otra parte / por otro lado — moreover / on another point. Es seguro; por otra parte, es rápido. → It’s safe; moreover, it’s fast.
* asimismo / igualmente / de igual modo — likewise. Se revisó el plan; de igual modo, el presupuesto. → The plan was reviewed; likewise, the budget.

5 . Negative addition

* ni — nor / neither.  No llamó ni escribió durante toda la semana. → He neither called nor wrote during the whole week.
* tampoco — not… either.  No fui al concierto, y ella tampoco quiso ir porque estaba cansada. → I didn’t go to the concert, and she didn’t want to go either because she was tired.

6 . Tiny but key: e (phonetic variant of y)

Spanish changes y → e before words that start with the sound /i/ (like i- or hi-), because saying y + i together sounds awkward.

Examples:

* Padres e hijos → Parents and children
* España e Italia → Spain and Italy
* Pobre e ignorante → Poor and ignorant

⚠️ Exception:

If the next word starts with hie- (pronounced /je/ like hielo or hiena), you keep y, because when the next word starts with hie-, it sounds like “ye” (not “ee”).

Examples:

* Agua y hielo → Water and ice
* Tierra y hierba → Earth and grass
* Niños y hienas → Children and hyenas

1o0e4v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLetThemTheory/comments/1o0e4v1/searching_after_purpose_of_life_here_is_that_navya/,searching after purpose of life ? here is that - Navya,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

Heyy everyone, Regardless of whoever is looking this I hope that you are going through a good day! As for me I did have a pretty good day!, I went to gym and read some books, went out with my friends for a really good cup of coffee with dark chocolate. Did some swimming for a while until I had to go inside like a submarine because I almost hit another person haha. finally I'm gonna wrap my day up with a good movie I'm gonna watch(please suggest me some movies!)

I feel like I have to address a few red flags because of the people who have reached out to me until now, Whereas I met a lot of wonderful people, I also met a few of the people that are making me add these **red flags**.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-Please don't reach out to me if you want **Situationship** or don't want to do LDR if we are far away, LDR here means getting to know each other before we meetup, like just a week or so, people have reached out wanting a LDR but backed off once I asked them to make it official. (after repeatedly telling me that they like me..? I want someone to be like the same way I'm being with them.)

\-I'm not a second/third wheel in a relationship nor I am a garbage truck to dump your emotional load onto me. Now sorry for being harsh but emotional load here means that information on your EX or how your EX treated you better than everyone else and how you can't go back to him, I'm not just a guy whom you can be emotional with and cut me off once you feel better.

\-After a lot of thinking I finally have added few of the good pic in my account as well, they are pinned.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up?

just like I have told you in the post, I'm a big fan of life, I love adventures, spontaneous trips or just cuddling in the bed while watching Netflix, I'm mature enough to give you your personal space and support you at times where you need me the most and immature enough to do fight water gun battles with you lol(I will win haha).

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you.

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!)

**Some of my hobbies:** I play badminton, piano, music, games, I love tinkering with projects and stuff, currently working as a citizen scientist part time, I love to explore new places/long drives, vacations. I like hiking and When I am tired I mostly do Netflix and chill. Cook something new or just learn something new. I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

I don't really mind the ages or anything like that and if in the off chance that I do get lucky, maybe we can start from LDR and end at ""I do""? hahaha

1o0e2sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1o0e2sa/tickling_can_be_abusive_but_i_dont_see_many/,Tickling can be abusive but I don’t see many people talk about it. Here’s my take. I think it’s used as an abuse tactic more than people realize.,"A lot of people will see that and say “no way tickling is a common form of abuse” “but you laugh when you get tickled” etc. 

But have you ever been held down and tickled until you couldn’t breathe? Maybe you even peed yourself. Sounds like something out of a children’s comedy movie. 

My dad loved to mess with us kids growing up, never to an extreme but enough to toughen us up a bit. Like he’d “milk the mouse” or give us “___ burns” (where you twist your hands in opposite directions around someone’s wrist, idk what to call it now so if you have an updated name for it lmk please), or tickle us. I fondly remember the time I was standing in the kitchen and my dad and little brother surprise tickle attacked me to the ground and tickled me until I could barely breathe. The thing was, my dad always stopped before it got to be harmful. It was always in good fun, just slightly pushing our limits to mess with us and it probably toughened us up in some ways, like if I can let my dad milk the mouse for a whole minute I can sit through getting 2 cavities filled. That sort of thing, building a tolerance to discomfort. 

However, when I was 10 my friends and I were having a sleepover and they ganged up on me and tickled me until I couldn’t breathe and felt like I was going to piss myself and throw up. That was the first time tickling was used as an abuse tactic on me. It was awful. I just wanted to go home. I felt like the odd one out and like if they wanted to hurt me, they could have. I was the smallest in the group. 

Then when I was 14 I got into an abusive relationship with an 18 year old. Long story short, he’d tickle me, “play fight” me, and pretend to hit me repeatedly until sure enough one of those “fake” hits landed and then he’d throw a fit that I was upset over an “accident”. But the tickling. He’d do it so often he couldn’t touch me without me flinching. Not bc I thought he’d hit me, but because I was sure he’d tickle me. He’d act like he was about to tickle me while I was driving, holding our baby, etc. he’d tickle me when it was straight up dangerous. But if I tried to do the same to him? He’d get borderline violent immediately. Not in a reactionary sense, not like what you’d expect (like one time I tickled my current partner and he accidentally kicked over the coffee table he had his foot resting on). But like would turn around real quick and pin me down. I left him when I was 18. 

A year later I started dating again, and met this guy who seemed very respectful at first. Then he started with the tickling and play fighting. Same deal. He’d do it until it was unbearable. He’d “play fight” with me while we chased each other with kitchen towels and whipped each other. But every time I was the one that ended up with welts from the towels. It felt wrong but I just assumed he was bigger and faster and stronger and maybe didn’t know his strength? Then one day I had my brother over, the man pinned me down and tickled me and wouldn’t let me go until I said “release me daddy”. While my brother was right there in the next room. Of course, I dint want to make a scene or have my brother dislike him so I did it as quietly as I could bc I didn’t want my brother to hear it. But same deal as the previous ex, I couldn’t dare tickle him back. He wasn’t as outright violent as my ex, but he’d shove me away like I was trying to hurt him and that ended up hurting me. There’s no way he didn’t understand it wasn’t fair and his reaction was extreme. Thankfully that relationship didn’t last long. 

And thankfully my current partner isn’t as reactionary when it comes to tickling. We both understand if we tickle the other person, we might get kicked by accident but we always show restraint. My current partner is *very* ticklish but he’s never hurt me in 5 years of messing with each other. The worst is the time he accidentally kicked the coffee table over lol. And then it wasn’t “well you made me kick it over, clean it up” we both laughed and cleaned up the mess together (RIP to the bong that was on the table tho lol). One time we were in the woods and he grabbed a vine and shook it. Way above him, like 8 feet away, a branch broke and fell and impaled the ground in front of me, it scraped my cheek as it fell to the ground. He ran to me like I had been shot, he couldn’t believe he had done something that could’ve seriously hurt me even if it was a complete freak occurrence. He was literally crying over it. Meanwhile I thought I cheated death like in the final destination movies lol it felt unbelievable. Like I really don’t think anyone will believe that this happened but it’s actually not the first time a falling branch has just barely missed me. 

Anyways, I was thinking about this because last night my boyfriend and I tickled each other. I had the remote and he tickled my foot to get my attention. He was laying at the foot of the bed and I wasn’t, so I sat up and tickled his ribs real quick and we had each other borderline pinned lol he had my foot and I had his ribs and then we called a truce and slowly released our grips on each other. And I realized in that moment, I don’t feel scared when he tickles me. I don’t feel like my autonomy is being forcefully ripped from me by just the tips of someone else’s fingers. It’s once again a fun way to mess with someone I love, and not something I expect and dread every day. 

And if someone is tickling you to the point of pain, doing it every day or often enough you feel the need to anticipate it, it’s abuse. It’s covert abuse. It doesn’t leave bruises, scars, welts, and no one thinks of it as abusive. Because it’s normally not. It’s a way to strip you of your control of your body. It’s restraining you with the least amount of effort a person could use. It’s letting you know that they can control you in an instant without leaving evidence of any abuse. In my experience, it starts with tickling and escalates. They’re testing the waters to see what they can get away with before the more overt abuse tactics start. 

So anyways, that’s what I’ve been thinking about this morning. Thanks for reading. ",91,1759841934.0,TwoXChromosomes,35,0.88,False

I have a routine that I’ve fine tuned and mapped out that works perfectly with my schedule, yet I still feel like there are not enough hours in the day to accomplish what I need to get done. 
I’ll share my routine and if you have any productive suggestion or tips to make this better please share! 

Background: I’m a researcher and work a partime job as well. 

5:45-6am- wake up, coffee, plants, journal 

Between 6:30-7:30am- Morning stretches
To do List, any admin things out of the way, bills paid, appointments etc 

7:30-8:30am- Tidy my house, laundry

8:30-10:30- breakfast, research, read

11:00- 1:00pm- workout for an hour, groceries, errands outside, light lunch

1:30-2:00pm- shower, get ready for the day

2:00-6pm- work 

6-7pm- cook dinner 

7-10pm- night stretches, read my book, overall relax, shower, prep for the next day 

10:30- bedtime 

Aside from this: my research does not seem to be progressing at the speed I want it to but I also don’t feel like I have much time to do things I enjoy without getting burnt out. Any suggestions?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

I think back to my last tank crew. A gunner that could not stay out of trouble, but had more potential than any soldier I've ever seen. A driver from Africa that stayed awake with me cruising the desert while everyone else slept. A loader that was too small for his job, but did everything he could to prove me wrong. 

I miss them, and every other crewman I've ever worked with.

It’s got this cozy, small-town vibe with the Fox River running right through downtown, but there’s a ton of new stuff happening too. Local shops and restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere, and the whole area feels like it’s quietly thriving without losing its character.

A few things I’ve noticed:

* The **downtown strip** feels more alive than ever with coffee shops, boutiques, and that awesome Riverwalk
* **Home prices** still come in a bit below Geneva and St. Charles even though you get the same scenic, historic charm
* **Schools** are well-rated and the commute’s not bad at all with I-88 nearby and Geneva’s Metra station just a few minutes away
* The **windmill museum** is quirky and cool

For those who live here or have been house hunting nearby, how’s Batavia been feeling to you lately?  
Is it getting more attention now, or still kind of flying under the radar compared to its neighbors? Pros of the area?

1o0dt9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1o0dt9c/i_cried_because_of_mary_grace_hot_chocolate/,I cried because of Mary Grace’ hot chocolate :(,"I took home three ensaymadas and one hot chocolate from Mary Grace because I really love them. During dinner, I shared with my partner how good they were, and that’s why I bought two more ensaymadas. I happily said, “Ang sarap talaga ng hot choco ng Mary Grace. Ang sarap ipair sa ensaymada. Itatabi ko nga itong hot choco para bukas.”

I wasn’t able to put my leftover in the fridge because I was taking care of my toddler alone, and I always have to run after him. (He runs fast and already knows how to climb the stairs.) I told myself I’d do it later. Before sleeping, I checked our dining table through our CCTV, and it was already cleared. My partner must have put it in the fridge, so I said, “Buti nailagay na niya sa ref, hindi na ako bababa sa kitchen.”

The next morning, I was very excited to eat breakfast. I scanned the fridge for my leftover, but I couldn’t find the hot chocolate. I asked him where he put it, and he said, “Wala akong nakita kagabi.” He even asked the helper, “May nakita ka bang chocolate dito kagabi?” and she said she didn’t see any on the table.

I felt very sad as I began to eat. I wasn’t talking and was trying to remember what happened last night. So, I checked the CCTV and watched it. I saw the hot chocolate on the table — it was there. AND THEN I SAW HIM PUT IT  STRAIGHT INTO THE SINK WHERE OUR DIRTY DISHES WERE!

“Nilagay mo pala sa lababo,” I said.

“Malay ko ba? Hindi ko alam na iinumin mo pa.”

I could feel my tears pooling in my eyes. “Pero sabi ko kagabi, diba, magtitira nga ako kasi kakainin ko pa yung ensaymada na natira.”

Then he shouted at me. “Edi bibili na lang ako ng bago, para kang bata.”

I silently cried and stopped talking to him. I finished breakfast without saying a word.

I can buy a hundred cups of hot chocolate if I wanted to — I can afford it. But I was hurt because I thought he was listening. He wasn’t. He didn’t acknowledge what I felt, he dismissed me, and he didn’t say sorry.

He even made a remark in the afternoon, saying, “Reklamador ka pa naman,” but I didn’t react. I stayed silent. I wasn’t talking at all.

Before dinner, he made me coffee and asked our toddler to hand it to me. I said thank you for the gesture. HOWEVER I DON’T DRINK COFFEE :) I can’t even finish a cup.

Maybe it’s because of my hormones, and it’s a “small thing” for some people. But it wasn’t for me. Tomorrow, I’ll treat myself to some ensaymada with hot chocolate on the side.

1o0dsbh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0dsbh,Experience with electric car (EV) in Greece mainland,"I rented a small/medium electric car (EV) from Athens Airport, after kind advice from comments on my earlier post. The car was an Opel Corsa-e, with an official range of 300km, but in reality it's closer to 250km with motorway driving.

I rented from Sixt, and despite them promoting EV rentals with their advertising, they only have three EVs: a Fiat 500, the Opel Corsa-e, and a Porsche (!). It's a shame they don't have any medium sized cars with a larger battery, yet. 

I used the app ΔΕΗ Blue to plan my first trip to Volos (approx. 350km), with two short stops along the way. Both stops had very fast chargers (160kW+), and the experience was completely hassle free. I just about had enough time for a toilet and coffee break before the car was at 80%+ and ready to go. Total cost was just over 20 Euros, and I had enough battery to last me a few days in Volos. 

One thing surprised me: an EV charging spot in the tiny village of Kissos, with Incharge, probably one of the only ones in Pelion. Driving in the mountain roads of Pelion is such a pleasure with an EV! No worry about gears, motor noise, braking,... it's all just one pedal, and on the downhill the car recharged so much. Highly recommended!

On the route back from Volos to Athens, I used the Incharge app. Those chargers seem to be much more common than ΔΕΗ Blue, especially at motorway stations. I didn't bother planning the route this time, and just decided to stop at motorway station with the EV charging sign. Another nice surprise: at the big motorway stop near Malakasa, there were free EV charging stations, with 60kW chargers! 

TL;DR: Overall driving an EV in Greece was completely hassle free. Two main apps for charging are DEI Blue and Incharge, but the Incharge is much more common. Just look for the EV charge sign on the motorway stops, like you would a petrol car, and enjoy!

I’ve recently moved them indoors (because I moved and have no balcony or way to safely put them outside), and they’ve started having these brown streaks on the leaves, and at first I thought it might be the water from the apartment, so I used the water from my britt’s and it’s still happening…not all of the spiderettes are showing these, but a majority of them are and then the mother plants have them as well. Right now they’re getting a good amount of indirect bright light, and coming from being outside after being indoor plants, I’m surprised anything adverse is happening.

I have been noticing little tiny flies that stick around some succulents I have and I also have a coffee plant that’s a decent size, a rattlesnake, and some elephant ears. The coffee plant does look like it’s having a hard time right now, but I think that one is a humidity issue. Will have to check back later with anyone here to confirm.

**Bottom Line:** The MOVA P10 Pro Ultra delivers flagship-level features at a mid-range price, offering exceptional cleaning performance with 13,000Pa suction, comprehensive automation, and smart obstacle avoidance. While customer support issues and some reliability concerns exist, this represents outstanding value for money—especially if you can find it on sale for under $550. It's essentially a Dreame L40 Ultra clone at significantly lower cost.

**Best For:** Multi-surface homes with pets, budget-conscious buyers wanting premium features, hard floor cleaning with occasional carpet use  
**Not Ideal For:** Heavy carpet-only homes, those requiring top-tier customer support, buyers needing proven long-term reliability (MOVA is relatively new brand)

# At a Glance

|Aspect|Rating|Summary|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Performance**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|Outstanding 13,000Pa suction outperforms models costing twice as much|
|**Ease of Use**|⭐⭐⭐⭐☆|Excellent app and automation but initial setup requires patience|
|**Value**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|Exceptional—flagship features for $599 (often on sale for $450-550)|
|**Build Quality**|⭐⭐⭐⭐☆|Solid construction but scattered hardware issues reported|
|**Support**|⭐⭐⭐☆☆|Biggest weakness—slow response times, warranty claim difficulties|

**Price:** $599 MSRP (regularly $450-550 on sale via Amazon/Walmart)

# Pros & Cons

# What We Love ✅

✅ **Exceptional suction power** \- 13,000Pa suction outperformed Roborock Saros 10R (10,000Pa) in tests; measured 1.08 kPa vs 0.58 kPa, handling pet hair, cat litter, and embedded dirt effortlessly  
✅ **Comprehensive automation** \- All-in-one dock auto-empties dust (75 days capacity), washes mops with 140°F water, dries with hot air, refills water, adds cleaning solution—truly hands-off for weeks  
✅ **Smart navigation excellence** \- LiDAR + RGB camera + 3D structured light recognizes 70+ obstacles; avoided socks, cables, pet toys flawlessly even in low-light conditions  
✅ **Outstanding battery efficiency** \- Achieved 2,157 sq ft per charge in testing, far exceeding 1,015 sq ft average; 5,200mAh battery lasts up to 2.5 hours

# What Could Be Better ⚠️

⚠️ **Customer support challenges** \- 21% of complaints involve slow response times (3-7 days), difficulty reaching support, complicated warranty claims  
⚠️ **Navigation glitches** \- Occasional docking failures, missed spots during first few runs (improves with mapping optimization)  
⚠️ **Mediocre on flattened carpet pet hair** \- Struggles with ground-in pet hair on carpets compared to hard floors where it excels

# Deal Breakers ❌ (If Any)

❌ **Reliability uncertainty** \- MOVA is a new brand (2024 sub-brand of Dreame); scattered hardware failures reported (sensors, pumps) raise long-term durability questions vs established brands

# What is MOVA P10 Pro Ultra?

**Simple explanation:** The MOVA P10 Pro Ultra is a fully-automated robot vacuum and mop combo that vacuums, mops, empties its own dustbin, washes and dries its own mop pads, and refills water automatically. It's designed to operate completely hands-free for 30-75 days between maintenance.

**Key differentiator:** Unlike budget robots that require constant emptying and manual mop cleaning, the P10 Pro Ultra features an advanced all-in-one dock with 140°F hot water mop washing and heated air drying—features typically found only in $1,000+ flagship models. It's essentially a rebranded Dreame L40 Ultra at 40-50% lower cost.

**Released:** Mid-2024  
**Manufacturer:** MOVA (sub-brand of Dreame Technology)  
**Warranty:** 3-year limited warranty (though support issues reported)  
**Made in:** China (Dreame Technology manufacturing)

# Our Testing Process

**Testing period:** August 22 - October 6, 2025 (45 days total)  
**Usage context:** 2,400 sq ft home with 60% hardwood, 30% carpet, 10% tile; two dogs (shedding breeds)  
**Comparison products:** Dreame L40 Ultra, Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra, Eufy X10 Pro Omni

# What We Tested

* Vacuum performance across debris types (cereal, sand, pet hair, cat litter)
* Mopping effectiveness on dried stains, sticky spills, daily grime
* Navigation accuracy, obstacle avoidance, edge cleaning capability
* Dock automation (emptying, mop washing/drying, water refill)
* Battery life at various suction levels
* App functionality, mapping, scheduling features

# Testing Environment

* **Home size:** 2,400 sq ft, 3 levels (primarily tested main floor 1,600 sq ft)
* **Floor types:** Hardwood 60%, low-pile carpet 30%, tile 10%
* **Obstacles:** Furniture legs, charging cables, pet toys, clothing items
* **Pets:** Two medium-sized dogs (constant shedding)

# Unboxing & First Impressions

# What's in the Box

* MOVA P10 Pro Ultra robot vacuum
* All-in-one Ultra Dock base station
* Two microfiber mop pads (pre-installed)
* 3.2L dust bag (pre-installed in dock)
* 4.5L clean water tank (empty)
* 4.0L dirty water tank (empty)
* Cleaning solution sample bottle
* Side brush
* Power cable and adapter
* Quick start guide and user manual

**Packaging quality:** 8/10 - Secure foam inserts, professional presentation, but instructions lack detail

**Missing items we expected:** Extra dust bags, additional mop pads (only one set included)

# Setup Experience

**Time to full setup:** 25 minutes (including app download, dock placement, initial mapping)

**Setup difficulty:** Moderate - Dock requires water line fill, app pairing has learning curve

**Steps required:**

1. Position dock against wall near outlet (avoid carpet) - 5 minutes
2. Fill 4.5L clean water tank, insert cleaning solution - 3 minutes
3. Download MOVAhome app, create account - 3 minutes
4. Pair robot via WiFi (2.4GHz only, frustrating with dual-band routers) - 5 minutes
5. Run initial mapping cycle - 9 minutes for 1,600 sq ft

**Setup issues encountered:** WiFi pairing failed twice (needed to manually select 2.4GHz network); water tank fill line not clearly marked (overfilled initially); app required firmware update before use

**First impression:** Robot feels premium with matte finish and quality construction. Dock is surprisingly large (18"" × 15"" × 17"") but sleek design. First cleaning run was impressive—vacuumed thoroughly and mopped without issues. Mop lifting worked perfectly on carpet transitions. Shocked by how much dirt it picked up that previous vacuum missed.

# Design & Build Quality

# Physical Specifications

* **Robot dimensions:** 13.8"" diameter × 3.9"" height
* **Robot weight:** 8.8 lbs
* **Dock dimensions:** 18.1"" × 15.4"" × 17.3"" (W × D × H)
* **Dock weight:** 22 lbs (empty), 37 lbs (full water/dust)
* **Color:** White/gray with gold accents
* **Dustbin capacity:** 350ml (robot), 3.2L (dock bag)
* **Water tanks:** 4.5L clean, 4.0L dirty

# Build Quality Assessment

**Overall construction:** 8/10

**Materials used:**

* Robot body: ABS plastic with matte finish - Premium feel, no flex, fingerprint-resistant
* LiDAR tower: Glossy plastic - Spins smoothly, well-sealed against dust
* Mop pads: Thick microfiber - Durable, machine-washable
* Dock: ABS plastic with textured panels - Solid but not premium feel

**Craftsmanship:** Clean assembly with tight tolerances. No rattles or squeaks. LiDAR tower rotates silently. Mop pad attachment mechanism is secure with audible click. Dock lid opens smoothly. Minor criticism: Water tank lids feel slightly cheap.

**Durability concerns:** User reports mention occasional sensor failures (2-3% of units), water pump issues after 3-6 months (rare), dock drying fan noise increase over time. Our unit showed zero issues through 45-day test.

**Aesthetic appeal:** Modern, clean design that blends well. Dock's white/gray color scheme is neutral. Gold accent stripe on robot adds premium touch without being flashy.

# Ergonomics & Comfort

**Comfort rating:** 9/10 (for maintenance tasks)

**Dust bag replacement:** Tool-free removal, no dust exposure, simple snap-in design  
**Water tank handling:** Large handles, easy to carry when full (heavy at 10 lbs), clear fill lines  
**Mop pad removal:** Velcro attachment removes/reattaches in seconds for machine washing

# Performance & Features

# Key Features

# 13,000Pa Turbocharged Suction

**What it does:** Powerful vacuum motor generates industry-leading suction to extract debris from carpets and hard floors  
**How it works:** Brushless motor with optimized airflow path creates strong negative pressure  
**Real-world benefit:** Tested at 1.08 kPa suction (vs 0.83 kPa average); effortlessly lifted embedded sand from carpet, collected 100% of cereal test debris, handled clumps of dog hair without clogging  
**Our experience:** Outperformed our previous Roborock in carpet deep cleaning; hardwood floors looked professionally swept  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

# All-in-One Ultra Dock Automation

**What it does:** Dock handles dust emptying, mop washing with 140°F hot water, heated air drying, water refilling, and cleaning solution dispensing  
**Performance:** Auto-empty worked flawlessly every time; mop washing cycle runs 2-4 minutes after each session; drying takes 2 hours but mops come out odor-free  
**Comparison:** Same features as Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra ($1,400) and Dreame X40 ($1,200) but at $599  
**Limitations:** Dock is large (occupies 2 sq ft floor space); mop drying is loud (60dB) but runs at night by default  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

# Dual Spinning Extendable Mops

**What it does:** Two rotating mop pads spin at 180 RPM; one extends outward via RoboSwing to clean edges and corners  
**Performance:** Edge cleaning improved by 40% vs non-extending mops; tackled dried coffee spills, sticky juice residue, and kitchen grime effectively  
**Our experience:** Mopping quality is good (not excellent) for daily maintenance but struggles with very tough dried stains that need manual scrubbing  
**Limitations:** Mops can't tackle week-old hardened stains; occasional streaking on large open floors  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

# 10.5mm Auto Mop Lifting

**What it does:** Mops automatically lift when robot detects carpet to avoid wetting fibers  
**Performance:** Worked 100% reliably in our testing; detected carpet instantly via ultrasonic sensors  
**Comparison:** Lifting height same as competitors; never wet our carpets once in 45 days  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

# 360° Intelligent Obstacle Avoidance

**What it does:** LiDAR + RGB camera + 3D structured light + LED illumination recognizes 70+ object types  
**Performance:** Avoided dog toys, socks, phone cables, shoes with 95% success rate; only collision was with transparent glass (camera limitation)  
**Our experience:** Vastly superior to older LiDAR-only systems; recognized pet waste and avoided it (huge relief!)  
**Limitations:** Occasionally mistakes dark carpets for obstacles in very dim rooms  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

# Performance in Real-World Scenarios

# Scenario 1: Daily Pet Hair Management (Primary Use Case)

**Task:** Clean 1,600 sq ft main floor with two shedding dogs producing tumbleweeds daily  
**Performance:** Collected 15g of pet hair per day average; no tangles on rubber roller brush; side brush extending feature captured 95% of edge hair vs 70% with non-extending brush  
**Observations:** Suction boost mode automatically activated in heavy hair areas (detected via camera); dock bag lasted full 75 days before needing replacement despite heavy pet hair load  
**Rating:** 10/10

# Scenario 2: Kitchen Deep Cleaning After Dinner Prep

**Task:** Vacuum flour, crumbs, dried sauce splatters; mop sticky spills and grease  
**Performance:** Vacuuming flawless—100% flour and crumb pickup; mopping removed 80% of dried sauce after one pass, 95% after manual setting to run twice  
**How it handled challenges:** Dirt detection worked perfectly—camera recognized heavy dirt and automatically did second mop pass  
**Rating:** 9/10

# Scenario 3: Multi-Room Navigation and Edge Cleaning

**Task:** Clean entire 2,400 sq ft home with 15 rooms, complex furniture layout, tight spaces  
**Performance:** Completed full home clean in 78 minutes; missed only 2% of floor area (under extremely low furniture); edge cleaning captured debris within 5mm of baseboards  
**Observations:** Got stuck once under recliner (clearance was exactly 3.9"", too tight); docking was problematic first week but improved after firmware update  
**Rating:** 8.5/10

# Scenario 4: Carpet-to-Hard-Floor Transitions

**Task:** Clean mixed surfaces: hardwood → area rug → tile → carpet repeatedly  
**Performance:** Mop lifting response time under 1 second; never wet carpet; suction automatically boosted on carpets; no debris carried from carpet to hard floor  
**Rating:** 10/10

# User Experience & Ease of Use

# Learning Curve

**Time to basic proficiency:** 1 hour (app setup, first clean, basic scheduling)  
**Time to advanced use:** 1 week (room customization, no-go zones, AI features optimization)  
**Difficulty rating:** Moderate - App has many features but logical organization

**Most intuitive aspects:**

* One-tap cleaning start
* Visual map editing with drag-and-drop no-go zones
* Battery and water level displayed clearly
* Voice control ""Hey MOVA"" works reliably

**Most confusing aspects:**

* WiFi setup requires 2.4GHz isolation (not obvious)
* Too many cleaning mode options (CleanGenius, Max+, Vacuum Only, Mop Only, etc.)—unclear which to choose
* Room naming defaults to ""Room 1, Room 2"" requiring manual editing
* Firmware updates sometimes reset custom settings

# Daily Use Experience

**Typical workflow:** Nothing—robot runs on schedule (7 AM daily), self-maintains, alerts via app when water/bags need attention (\~monthly)

**Friction points:** Occasional ""mop pad stuck"" error requiring removal and reattachment; dock drying fan is loud (60dB) if scheduled during daytime; water tank needs refilling weekly with daily use

**Delightful moments:** Coming home to perfectly clean floors without lifting a finger; watching it detect and avoid pet mess; pet video monitoring feature showing dogs' reactions to robot; hot water mop washing eliminates odors completely

**Comparison to similar products:** More automated than Eufy X10 (no hot water wash); same automation level as Dreame L40 but $400 cheaper; slightly less refined navigation than Roborock but 90% as good

# Interface/Controls

**Interface type:** MOVAhome smartphone app (iOS/Android), ""Hey MOVA"" voice assistant, Alexa/Google Home integration

**Responsiveness:** App connects to robot within 2 seconds; commands execute immediately; real-time map updates show position

**Intuitiveness:** 8/10 - Logical menu structure but overwhelming number of settings for beginners

**Customization options:** Room-specific suction/water levels, cleaning schedules per room, virtual walls, no-go zones, no-mop zones, carpet boost on/off, AI dirt detection sensitivity, mop route patterns

# Pricing & Value

# Cost Breakdown

**Base price:** $599 (MSRP)  
**Typical sale price:** $450-550 (Amazon, Walmart sales occur monthly)  
**Best price seen:** $449 (Black Friday 2024)

**Optional add-ons:**

* TriCut anti-tangle brush: $35 (highly recommended for long hair)
* Extra mop pads (2-pack): $20
* Dust bags (3-pack): $18
* Cleaning solution (33.8oz): $15

**Total cost (fully equipped):** $687 (robot + TriCut brush + extra pads/bags + solution)

* Mop pads: \~$20/year (replace every 6 months)
* Cleaning solution: \~$45/year (1 bottle every 3 months)
* **Total annual:** \~$71 ($5.92/month)

# Value Assessment

**Price positioning:** Mid-range pricing with flagship features (incredible value)

**Is it worth the price?** Absolutely yes at $450-600 - You get 95% of Dreame L40 Ultra ($900) or Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra ($1,400) performance for 40-60% less cost. The feature set is identical to robots costing $1,000+. Only compromise is brand reputation and customer support quality.

**Cost per clean:** Approximately $0.19 per cleaning session (3-year lifespan, 1,095 cleans, $687 total cost)

**Comparable alternatives:**

* **Dreame L40 Ultra** at $900 - Same hardware, better brand support, $350 more
* **Roborock Qrevo S** at $650 - Less suction (12,000Pa), smaller water tanks, similar features
* **Eufy X10 Pro Omni** at $550 - No hot water wash, inferior obstacle avoidance, comparable price

**Where you're paying premium for:** Hot water mop washing, heated drying, 13,000Pa suction, extending mop/brush, RGB camera obstacle avoidance, pet monitoring

**Where it feels overpriced:** Customer support quality doesn't match premium brands; occasional quality control issues mean you're taking small risk

# Money-Saving Tips

* Wait for monthly Amazon sales (20-25% off brings to $450-480)
* Skip TriCut brush initially—included rubber brush works fine unless you have very long hair
* Use third-party cleaning solution ($8 on Amazon vs $15 official)
* Wash and reuse mop pads instead of replacing (machine-washable 50+ times)

**Support channels:** Email (slow), app tickets (very slow), phone (moderate wait, US hours only)  
**Support quality:** 6/10 - Representatives knowledgeable when reached but access is difficult; warranty claims reportedly slow

**Documentation quality:**

* **User manual:** 7/10 - Covers basics adequately but lacks troubleshooting depth
* **Online resources:** 6/10 - Limited video tutorials, FAQ is sparse
* **Video tutorials:** Few official videos; community-created content fills gaps

**Community support:** Growing Reddit community (r/RobotVacuums), active Facebook groups where users help each other—often faster than official support

# Biggest Complaint: Customer Support Issues

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Is the MOVA P10 Pro Ultra worth the money?

Yes, at $450-600 this is exceptional value. You get flagship features (hot water mop washing, 13,000Pa suction, RGB obstacle avoidance) found in $1,000-1,400 robots. Performance testing shows it rivals Dreame L40 ($900) and outperforms many $800+ models. Only caveat: MOVA is new brand with limited support track record, so you're trading established reputation for 40% cost savings. If you can tolerate potential support headaches, it's outstanding value.

# How does it compare to Dreame L40 Ultra?

They're virtually identical—MOVA is Dreame's sub-brand. P10 Pro actually has higher suction (13,000Pa vs 11,000Pa) and extending side brush. L40 has slightly hotter mop washing (149°F vs 140°F, minimal real-world difference). Main difference: L40 costs $350 more and has better established support. Performance is essentially equal—buy whichever is cheaper on sale.

# What's the main drawback of the P10 Pro Ultra?

Customer support is the biggest weakness. Our analysis of 200+ complaints shows 21% involve slow support response (3-7 days), difficulty reaching reps, and complicated warranty claims. MOVA is a new brand without mature support infrastructure. If your unit works perfectly, it's fantastic. If you get a lemon (rare but happens), prepare for frustration. Buying from retailer with good return policy (Amazon, Costco) mitigates this risk.

# How long does the battery last and what's the coverage?

5,200mAh battery lasted 2.5 hours in testing, covering 2,157 sq ft per charge—far above the 1,015 sq ft industry average. For reference: 1,600 sq ft home takes 78 minutes and uses 65% battery. Automatic recharge-and-resume works flawlessly for homes exceeding one-charge capacity. Battery should maintain 80%+ capacity for 3-4 years based on lithium-ion typical degradation.

# Can it handle long pet hair without tangling?

The included rubber brush handles moderate pet hair well. For households with long-haired pets, upgrade to TriCut anti-tangle brush ($35 add-on) which uses cutting blades to chop hair. Testing shows 26% hair catch rate with TriCut vs 59% with standard brush. The extending side brush also lifts automatically to avoid hair tangles. Multiple users confirm excellent long-hair performance with TriCut installed.

# Does the hot water mop washing actually work?

Yes, 140°F hot water combined with scrubbing action effectively cleans mop pads. After 45 days testing, mops remain odor-free (huge upgrade from cold-water systems). Dried dirt and grime on pads dissolved completely. Heated air drying (2 hours) prevents mildew growth. Only limitation: 140°F isn't hot enough to sanitize (would need 160°F+), so mops should still be machine-washed monthly for hygiene.

# Is it better for hard floors or carpets?

Hard floors are where it excels—100% debris pickup, excellent edge cleaning with extending mop/brush, outstanding mopping performance. Carpets are good but not exceptional: 87% deep clean score (vs 95%+ from carpet specialists). Side brush doesn't extend on carpet which hurts edge performance. If your home is 70%+ hard floors, this is perfect. Carpet-heavy homes should consider alternatives.

# Where's the best place to buy the P10 Pro Ultra?

**Best overall:** Amazon - $499-599, frequent 20% off sales to $450-480; easy returns (30 days); fast Prime shipping  
**Best for peace-of-mind:** Walmart - Similar pricing; in-store returns easier than shipping back to Amazon  
**Avoid:** Third-party sellers on eBay/Facebook Marketplace (common scams, no warranty)  
**Current deals (Oct 2025):** Amazon $549 (clip 10% coupon), Walmart $599, MOVA direct $599

# Final Verdict

# Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4.2/5)

**Rating Breakdown:**

* **Performance:** 5/5 - Outstanding suction, mopping, automation; rivals models costing twice as much
* **Build Quality:** 4/5 - Solid construction but scattered QC issues lower confidence
* **Ease of Use:** 4/5 - Excellent once setup; initial WiFi pairing frustrating
* **Value:** 5/5 - Exceptional value—flagship features at mid-range price
* **Support:** 3/5 - Major weakness; slow response times, difficult to reach

# The Bottom Line

The MOVA P10 Pro Ultra delivers flagship robot vacuum performance at mid-range pricing, earning it Vacuum Wars' ""Best Value"" award for mid-2025. With 13,000Pa suction outperforming competitors, comprehensive dock automation (auto-empty, hot water mop washing, heated drying), intelligent obstacle avoidance, and extending mop/brush for edge cleaning, it matches or exceeds robots costing $1,000-1,400. Testing confirmed it's essentially a Dreame L40 Ultra clone at 40% lower cost. The catch: MOVA is a new brand with inconsistent customer support and scattered reliability issues. For buyers willing to accept new-brand risk in exchange for incredible value, this is an easy recommendation. For those requiring proven reliability and responsive support, pay extra for Roborock or established brands.

# Our Recommendation

* Your home is 70%+ carpet (get dedicated carpet specialist instead)
* You're risk-averse and want proven 5+ year reliability track record

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

Enter **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** — web apps that feel like native apps, work offline, send push notifications, and can even sit on your home screen.

But here’s the thing: it’s not just about having a PWA. The ones that *really* win in 2025 are the ones with **subtle UX strategies** you barely notice, but make a huge difference:

* **Offline magic:** Starbucks lets you build your coffee order offline, syncing later. ☕
* **Perceived speed:** Pinterest Lite shows content instantly with skeleton screens, even on slow networks. ⚡
* **Micro-trust:** Alibaba’s checkout animations reduce anxiety without you realizing it.
* **Seamless engagement:** Twitter Lite nudges you back only when relevant.

These PWAs aren’t flashy — they’re *thoughtful*. They solve friction points invisibly, making the user experience smooth, reliable, and engaging.

The Premise
I run a small café—warm, cozy, and unassuming. My days are filled with coffee beans, pastries, and the little routines of regulars who come in for their daily fix. My world is simple, steady, and safe.

Yours is not. You’re the mafia boss: dangerous, powerful, and feared by many. But one day, you step into my shop. Maybe it’s to escape the chaos outside, maybe it’s curiosity, or maybe it’s something else entirely. Whatever the reason, once you’re in my world, neither of us stays untouched.

The Dynamic
✨ I offer warmth and comfort, you carry danger and authority.
✨ I want peace, you live in chaos.
✨ Our worlds clash, but there’s something magnetic pulling us together.

What I’m Looking For
	•	A partner to play the mafia boss with depth—someone who’s more than just a title, with vulnerabilities under the surface.
	•	First-person, present tense, multi-paragraph style, with plenty of detail and emotion.
	•	A mix of romance, drama, and slice-of-life moments: quiet mornings in the café, stolen glances, and soft conversations that contrast with the violence surrounding you.

Themes I’d Love to Explore
	•	Forbidden romance, secrecy, and slow-burn tension.
	•	Domestic comfort versus the brutality of the mafia world.
	•	Everyday life threatened by danger (rival gangs, protection, hidden enemies).
	•	The push and pull between my need for normalcy and your life of crime.

If you’re interested in building a story where comfort meets chaos, and where tenderness grows in the shadow of danger, send me a message—I’d love to plot this out with you.
Please write ‘strawberry’ at the beginning of your message to show you’ve read this all and send me some information about your writing experience.

Welcome to the world of **IoT (Internet of Things)**, where everyday objects become intelligent, connected, and incredibly helpful.

The **Internet of Things** isn't just a futuristic concept anymore. It's reshaping how we live, work, and interact with technology every single day. From the smartwatch on your wrist to the traffic lights managing city flow, **IoT technology** is quietly revolutionizing our world in ways most people don't even realize.

# Understanding IoT: What Does Internet of Things Actually Mean?

**IoT (Internet of Things)** refers to the vast network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity features that enable them to collect and exchange data over the internet. Think of it as giving everyday objects the ability to talk to each other and make smart decisions based on the information they gather.

The beauty of **IoT technology** lies in its simplicity from a user perspective, while the complexity happens behind the scenes. Your smartphone communicates with your car to pre-cool the interior before you arrive. Your refrigerator monitors food expiration dates and suggests recipes based on available ingredients. Your fitness tracker analyzes your sleep patterns and recommends optimal workout times.

At its core, IoT transforms ordinary objects into smart ones by connecting them to the internet and enabling data-driven decision making. This connectivity creates ecosystems where devices work together seamlessly, often anticipating your needs before you even realize them yourself.

# How Does IoT Technology Actually Work?

Understanding how IoT devices function requires breaking down the process into four essential components that work together like a well-orchestrated symphony.

# The Four Core Components of IoT Systems

Sensors and data collection form the foundation of every **IoT system**. These tiny components act like digital senses, constantly monitoring temperature, motion, light, sound, humidity, location, and countless other environmental factors. A smart thermostat uses temperature sensors, a fitness tracker monitors heart rate and movement, while industrial IoT devices might track machinery vibrations or chemical compositions.

# How IoT Devices Communicate

Connectivity serves as the communication highway that allows IoT devices to share their collected data. This happens through various methods including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, satellite connections, or specialized IoT protocols like LoRaWAN and Zigbee. The choice of connectivity depends on factors like power consumption, range requirements, and data transmission needs.

# Data Processing and Intelligence

Data processing transforms raw sensor data into meaningful information. This can happen locally on the device (edge computing) or remotely in cloud servers. Advanced IoT applications use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns, make predictions, and trigger automated responses based on the processed data.

# User Interaction and Control

User interface completes the cycle by presenting insights and enabling control through smartphone apps, web dashboards, voice assistants, or automated actions. The best **IoT systems** work so seamlessly that users barely notice the technology. They just experience the benefits.

# Real-World IoT Examples Transforming Daily Life

# Smart Home Applications

Smart home [IoT applications](https://www.secuodsoft.com/iot-application-development.php) have become the most recognizable examples of how this technology enhances daily living. Smart thermostats like Nest learn your schedule and preferences, automatically adjusting temperature while you're away to save energy and ensuring comfort when you return. Smart security systems provide real-time monitoring, instant alerts, and remote access, giving homeowners unprecedented control over their property's safety.

Voice assistants represent perhaps the most interactive IoT devices in modern homes. These smart speakers don't just play music. They control lighting, manage calendars, order groceries, provide weather updates, and serve as central hubs for entire smart home ecosystems. The integration capabilities continue expanding as more manufacturers adopt compatible IoT protocols.

# Wearable Health Technology

Wearable **IoT technology** has revolutionized personal health monitoring and fitness tracking. Modern smartwatches and fitness trackers don't just count steps. They monitor heart rate variability, track sleep stages, detect irregular heart rhythms, measure blood oxygen levels, and even predict potential health issues before symptoms appear. This continuous health monitoring enables proactive healthcare management and early intervention.

# Industrial and Smart City Solutions

Industrial **IoT applications** are transforming manufacturing, logistics, and infrastructure management in ways that directly impact consumers. Smart traffic lights adjust timing based on real-time traffic flow, reducing commute times and fuel consumption. Connected vehicles communicate with infrastructure and other cars to prevent accidents and optimize routes. Supply chain **IoT devices** ensure product quality and authenticity while reducing waste and improving delivery efficiency.

# The Transformative Benefits of IoT Technology

# Convenience and Home Automation

Enhanced convenience and automation tops the list of **IoT benefits** for most users. The technology eliminates repetitive tasks and creates seamless experiences that adapt to individual preferences and schedules. Your home can automatically adjust lighting based on time of day, your car can navigate to avoid traffic congestion, and your appliances can order their own maintenance before breaking down.

# Energy Efficiency and Cost Savings

Improved efficiency and resource management delivers both environmental and economic advantages. **Smart IoT systems** optimize energy consumption, reduce waste, and extend equipment lifespan through predictive maintenance. Smart irrigation systems water plants only when needed, smart lighting adjusts brightness based on natural light availability, and smart HVAC systems maintain comfort while minimizing energy usage.

# Data-Driven Insights

Data-driven decision making empowers users with insights that were previously impossible to obtain. **IoT devices** provide detailed analytics about usage patterns, performance metrics, and optimization opportunities. Businesses use this data to improve operations, while consumers gain a better understanding of their habits and resource consumption.

# Safety and Security Improvements

Enhanced safety and security represents a critical advantage of **IoT technology**. Connected smoke detectors provide early warnings and automatically contact emergency services. Smart locks enable remote access management and detailed entry logs. Health monitoring **IoT devices** can detect emergencies and automatically alert family members or healthcare providers.

# Navigating IoT Security and Privacy Considerations

While **IoT technology** offers tremendous benefits, it also introduces new security and privacy challenges that users must understand and address. **IoT devices** collect vast amounts of personal data, from daily routines and location information to health metrics and behavioral patterns. This data requires protection through encryption, secure authentication, and responsible data handling practices.

IoT security challenges stem from several factors. Many **IoT devices** have limited computing power, making it difficult to implement robust security measures. Manufacturers sometimes prioritize convenience and cost over security, leaving devices vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Users often neglect to change default passwords or update device firmware, creating additional security risks.

Protecting your **IoT devices** requires proactive measures including regular firmware updates, strong unique passwords, network segmentation, and careful consideration of what data you're willing to share. Choose devices from reputable manufacturers who prioritize security and provide regular updates. Consider creating a separate network for IoT devices to isolate them from sensitive personal data.

From a [software development](https://www.secuodsoft.com/custom-software-development.php) perspective, we've seen how important it is to choose IoT devices from manufacturers who prioritize security updates and have established track records for supporting their products long-term. At [Secuodsoft](https://www.secuodsoft.com/), we recommend this approach to all our clients exploring IoT implementations.

# The Future of Internet of Things: What's Coming Next

# 5G Revolution and Connectivity

5G technology is set to supercharge [IoT applications](https://www.secuodsoft.com/iot-application-development.php) by providing faster, more reliable connections with lower latency. This advancement will enable new applications like real-time remote surgery, autonomous vehicle networks, and massive **smart city** deployments that require instant communication between thousands of devices.

# Edge Computing Integration

Edge computing is bringing more processing power directly to **IoT devices**, reducing dependence on cloud connectivity and improving response times. This shift enables more sophisticated local decision-making and reduces privacy concerns by processing sensitive data locally rather than sending it to remote servers.

# AI-Powered Automation

Artificial intelligence integration is making **IoT systems** increasingly intelligent and autonomous. Future **IoT devices** will not just collect data but will learn from it, predict future needs, and make complex decisions without human intervention. This evolution will create truly proactive systems that anticipate and address problems before they occur.

# Why IoT Adoption is Accelerating in 2025

The rapid growth of **IoT technology** isn't just about cool gadgets anymore. Businesses and consumers are discovering that **IoT devices** solve real problems while providing measurable returns on investment. Energy costs are rising globally, making smart energy management systems increasingly attractive. Remote work has created new demands for home automation and security solutions. Healthcare costs continue climbing, driving adoption of preventive health monitoring through wearable **IoT devices**.

What's particularly interesting about the current **IoT landscape** is how quickly costs have dropped while capabilities have expanded. Five years ago, implementing a comprehensive smart home system required significant technical knowledge and substantial investment. Today, you can start with a $25 smart plug and gradually build a sophisticated **IoT ecosystem** using intuitive smartphone apps.

The technology has also become much more reliable and user-friendly. Early **IoT devices** often suffered from connectivity issues, complex setup procedures, and poor integration between different brands. Modern **IoT platforms** emphasize seamless user experiences, with many devices connecting automatically and working together regardless of manufacturer.

# Getting Started with IoT: Practical Steps for Beginners

# Start Small and Build Gradually

Starting your **IoT journey** doesn't require technical expertise or massive investment. Begin with simple, single-purpose devices that address specific needs or interests. A smart thermostat, security camera, or fitness tracker can provide immediate benefits while helping you understand how **IoT technology** works in practice.

# Choose Compatible Ecosystems

Consider your existing ecosystem when choosing **IoT devices**. If you already use specific platforms like Apple HomeKit, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa, selecting compatible devices ensures seamless integration and simplified management. This approach also reduces the number of different apps and interfaces you need to learn.

# Focus on Value Over Features

Focus on devices that offer clear value propositions rather than novelty features. The most successful **IoT adoptions** start with devices that solve real problems or significantly improve existing processes. As you gain experience and confidence, you can expand into more complex **IoT applications** and create integrated smart systems.

Whether you're interested in creating a **smart home**, improving business operations, or exploring how **IoT devices** can enhance your daily life, the key is starting small and building gradually. At \[Your Company Name\], we've seen firsthand how this measured approach leads to more successful IoT adoptions and better user satisfaction. The connected future is already here. It's just waiting for you to plug in and experience its transformative potential.

# Conclusion: Embracing the Connected Future

IoT (Internet of Things) represents more than just technological advancement. It's a fundamental shift toward more intelligent, responsive, and efficient ways of living and working. From simple smart plugs to complex industrial systems, **IoT technology** is making our world more connected, data-driven, and user-centric.

The journey into **IoT** doesn't happen overnight, but the benefits become apparent quickly once you begin incorporating **smart devices** into your daily routine. As the technology continues evolving and maturing, early adopters will find themselves well-positioned to take advantage of new capabilities and applications.

Whether you're interested in creating a **smart home**, improving business operations, or simply curious about how **IoT devices** can enhance your daily life, the key is starting small and building gradually. The connected future is already here. It's just waiting for you to plug in and experience its transformative potential.",1,1759840175.0,u_Secuodsoftpvtltd,0,1.0,False

Naturally her condition has progressed further over the years, more so this year and we’re beginning to struggle so much meeting her needs.

Me and my partner also have a 2 and half year old toddler in the mix too.

Every Christmas we’re extremely exhausted and run down. I’ve always worked in an industry that’s very busy with no time off allowed, where I typically end up working until the evening of Christmas Eve, always feel too tired on Christmas Day itself to truly enjoy it, same on Boxing Day and then I’m usually back to work. 

Adding to the exhaustion now is having to try and entertain my grandma when she no longer truly understands what Christmas even is, and hasn’t done for I’d say the last two years now. She’s more just confused and angry now if it falls on a day when he friend would usually visit her, or where she’d go to her day care centre as she can’t understand why they’re not happening. 

Last Christmas wasn’t too bad. We went to a restaurant for Christmas dinner and she behaved and didn’t kick up any fussing, but as this year has gone on, she’s deteriorated rapidly. Communication is zero. Her anger and aggression is becoming regular. She’s wetting the bed severely every night, and it’s a gamble each and everyday whether we’re going to have to clean her bowel movements up from the toilet, floor, walls or all three. 

Me and my partner have been mulling over putting my grandma into a care home for the Christmas period this year to actually give us a break. Positives being we can truly stay at home all day in our pyjamas and really enjoy it with our son this year without having to mop shit off the floor, do mountains of urine soaked laundry all day, and not have to communicate in 1,000 different ways why her neighbour didn’t come for coffee that morning and trying to calm her anxiety ridden mind. And in a care home she’s with likeminded people who she can be more social with which she needs.

But to me, as much as I was this, it just feels morally wrong at the same time. I feel like Christmas is a time for family, and her friends are just going to think we’re horrible people. My grandma has only ever done respite once earlier this year and she absolutely loved it but has argued with me numerous times about how horrible it was and she’ll never go back, so I’m also not prepared to try and explain she’s going there to her and the potential arguments and backlash when she comes home. 

But now this is also sparked a serious argument between me and my partner, as she’s exposed to the caregiving more than I am and is really run down and stressed which I don’t dismiss. I want to give her a relaxing Christmas for once. But it just feels so wrong and I’m not prepared for the fights..",14,1759840027.0,dementia,19,1.0,False

1o0d92a,https://www.reddit.com/r/StanRichson/comments/1o0d92a/093025_stream_summary/,[09/30/25] Stream Summary,"### From Phenomenology to Pen Jokes: Deconstructing ""Experience in the Moment""

Hey everyone! In today's stream, we made some fantastic progress preparing for the next video in our YouTube series, ""A Guided Walkthrough."" The focus was entirely on Part One's next major section: ""Experience in the Moment."" We spent our time building the narrative skeleton for the video, outlining the key talking points, and doing a live, in-depth read-through of the document itself. This session was all about bridging the gap between the ""outside view"" of collective knowledge and the ""inside view"" of our own subjective, moment-to-moment experience.

* **Video Prep:** We successfully outlined the narrative arc for the ""Experience in the Moment"" video. The plan is to guide viewers from an intuitive exploration of consciousness and self-awareness, through a brief mindfulness exercise, and ultimately to the crucial role that *meaning* plays as our primary lens for understanding reality.
* **Document Deep Dive:** We performed a live read-through of a significant portion of the document, analyzing its arguments on how the world ""shows up"" to us as already meaningful. We discussed the concepts of habitual engagement, concern, and how disruptions to our automatic flow force us into a state of reflection, making our implicit understanding explicit.
* **Deconstructing Derrida:** Thanks to a fantastic suggestion from chat, we took a detour into the philosophy of Jacques Derrida to explore his concept of *différance*. We discussed how meaning is created through both difference (a concept is defined by what it is not) and deferral (meaning is always postponed in a chain of references), connecting it directly to the document's themes.
* **What's in a Word?:** We examined where the document stands on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, concluding that it aligns with the ""weak"" version (linguistic relativity). The consensus is that language doesn't rigidly *determine* our thoughts, but it powerfully *influences* and structures our experience, acting as an anchor for our concepts.

The core of today's stream can be distilled into a simple mental model: **the flow and the break**. Most of your day is spent in a state of seamless, automatic ""flow,"" where you act within an implicit field of meaning without thinking about it (driving a familiar route, grabbing your coffee cup). The practical advice is to pay attention to the ""break."" When something disrupts your flow—your pen runs out of ink, you can't find your keys, a link is broken—don't just see it as an annoyance. See it as a spotlight. That moment of disruption illuminates the vast, complex web of assumptions, expectations, and concerns you were just operating on. For a second, the invisible becomes visible. Try to notice one of these moments today and ask yourself: what implicit understanding was just forced into the open?

### Chatter of the Day

A huge shout-out to **energydahamter** for being our Chatter of the Day! They consistently dropped incredibly insightful questions and concepts into the chat that elevated the entire conversation. By introducing Jacques Derrida, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, George Miller's ""magic number 7,"" and Jonathan Haidt, they sparked several of the most productive and fascinating discussions of the stream. Thanks for helping us think deeper!

### Highlights of the Day

* **The Great Pen Debate:** A simple off-hand comment about using a ""pen"" as an example for a philosophical concept quickly and hilariously spiraled into a debate about which pen is the most *powerful*. After weighing the merits of the written word, we explored the consciousness-altering potential of other, more... potent... pens, leading to a great, lighthearted moment.
* **Making Sense of *Différance*:** One of the most intellectually satisfying moments was our live, collaborative attempt to understand Derrida's complex idea of *différance*. We worked together to break down the dual meaning of differing and deferring, connecting it back to the document's argument that concepts are dynamic and defined by their relationships to other concepts, never existing in a vacuum. It was a perfect example of thinking through a tough idea together.

### Quotes of the Day

* ""The richness of meaning always exceeds what we grasp explicitly. Our concepts and words provide a structured way of thinking about reality, but never fully encompass the depth of our experience."" - **StanRichson** (reading from the document)
* ""I have one suggestion which I think will be relevant for the document but it’s not very cognitive science-y however I believe you might appreciate it"" - **energydahamter** (The perfect prelude to our Derrida deep dive)
* ""sounds like you've been hitting the pen"" - **dharma_dom_**
* ""It's not like there's this common idea that we're like usually rational... It's rather, it's all of our experience of meaning is quite emotional. But when that emotion isn't too intense... we could feel quite comfortable in our experience and even think that we're not actually experiencing a lot of feeling in it."" - **StanRichson**

### Key Concepts

* **Phenomenology:** In our discussion, this referred to the philosophical method of investigating the structure of our subjective, first-person experience to understand how the world appears to us as meaningful.
    * *For more:* The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on [""Phenomenology.""](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/)
* ***Différance* (Jacques Derrida):** A key concept in deconstruction, this term implies that meaning is generated by a play of *differences* between concepts, and that final, stable meaning is perpetually *deferred* or postponed, as words only point to other words.
    * *For more:* Check out the BBC Radio 4 ""In Our Time"" episode on [""Derrida's 'On Grammatology'.""](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00j62cf)
* **Linguistic Relativity (The ""Weak"" Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis):** This is the theory that the language we speak influences, but does not strictly determine, how we perceive and categorize the world, making certain ways of thinking more habitual or accessible.
    * *For more:* Lera Boroditsky’s TED Talk, [""How language shapes the way we think,""](https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think) offers a great, accessible introduction.

### Continuing the conversation…

When was the last time a simple disruption—like a broken tool, a misplaced item, or an unexpected event—forced you to reflect on something you normally take for granted? What did you realize in that moment?",1,1759839789.0,StanRichson,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

There’s 4 of us in this group including me, all of us having our baby boys in 2024, mine being the youngest born in November. Throughout the year, I’ve attended each of their little ones birthday (besides one, as his mum briefly spoke about doing a picnic but no plans were made). But I did buy him a gift. I’ve shown up and made an effort for all of their kids. 

My little one’s birthday is next month, I’ve hired out a venue, due to it being in November (otherwise would have done a garden party or somewhere outdoors) and I have a huge family so would be too cramped in the house. I made everyone aware back in April when I booked the venue, so they’ve been informed for a while. I’ve recently asked who is attending due to needing to pay per child for their lunch and all of them have been so flaky with a response. The venue is 30 mins away and 2 of them don’t drive, so understand it’s inconvenient. I have offered to give one of them a lift and the others partner does drive (I have also said partners can attend). But still getting flaky responses. If they can’t make it due to travel then I would understand, but none of them have even said “I’m not going to be able to make it but let’s catch a lunch or coffee date to celebrate instead.” And that’s what’s annoying me. I have shown up and celebrated each of their children’s special day in any way I can but now that it’s my son’s turn not one of them is making the effort. 

Am I overreacting in this? Or should it be a boundary I set? I kinda expected it from one mum as she also let down another mum the other month for her sons 1st birthday, when we had plans, she agreed to them and then just went awol without letting her know she wasn’t coming (despite us messaging to say we’re here waiting for her) and only messaged hours later to apologise. And tbh, I was angry for that mum then. 

I’m going to wait to see how it plays out, but if they don’t show up in some sort of way for my child on his birthday am I overreacting if I remove myself from the group? And by showing up I mean, sending a happy birthday message, asking how his days going, what we’re doing. Like we all generally do via chat on the kids birthdays. And also I don’t want to sound entitled but even gifts, like I’m not expecting something expensive, even just a card to just show care as I know it’s close to Christmas, but am I right to feel let down for my son when they haven’t shown up in the same way we have?

Looking to hike, play magic, roam bookstores, get coffee and chat, and do simple things together. 
Hit me up if your current friends aren’t putting in the effort. Let’s create new friendships. ",3,1759839257.0,chilliwack,0,1.0,False
