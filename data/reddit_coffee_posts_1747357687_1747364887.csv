1knqrnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1knqrnq/aith_for_not_showing_up_for_my_boyfriend_for_a/,AITH for not showing up for my boyfriend for a couple of days while he was grieving ?,"I (29F) got dumped by my boyfriend (29M) today. The reason being that one of his close family members passed away a couple of months ago and I did not show up for him for a couple of days. I was present on the day we got the news,  I was present the next day (day2) too for his family dinner, the next day (day3), I asked him to help me fix a coffee table thinking this will distract him a little and would be a bonding moment for us. He did try to help but we ended up fighting while fixing it. I already had a lot of unresolved issues with him way before we got the news of his family member passing away, I ignored it all and supported him, but the day we fought- I was really distressed from the fight with him and I had also had an intense argument with my mom on the same day, I was not feeling emotionally stable to be a support for him for his family dinner. The next day , 2 of my close friends got really sick (friends that I call family and they are the only family I have in this country)- I went to meet them since they have always been there for me whenever I fell sick. I had communicated this to my boyfriend and he seemed fine with it at the time. The next day (5th day after his family member passing away), he sent me long text messages that Iam not being a great support for him. I apologized, agreed and I did my best to be his support for the next 2 months. I helped him with moving (packing), I painted his house (even while I was sick), I attended his family gatherings (while I was sick), I attended the funeral and was with him the entire time. Before the funeral, and even after the funeral- I let him sleep at my house for about 3 months(he had some neighbor issues at his place at the time), during these 3 months a lot of days we ended up fighting for hours, to the extent where it was affecting my health, I felt like breaking up but I didn’t and I still let him sleep in my bedroom while I slept on the couch with my cat (he is allergic to my cat and my cat is clingy). 

Now he sold that house where he was having trouble sleeping, got a new job at a different city and he broke up with me 2 weeks before he is suppose to move to the new city. Reason according to him is that I was not there for him when he needed me the most (I have apologized multiple times for this and also given evidence that I have showed up for him a lot many other times). 
And the reason why I thought it was okay to miss for those two times was in the past, we had an incident where he had abandoned me and we had a long fight on that- and as a resolution being - we both had agreed that we would be vocal with each other if we want the other person to show up for us. 
When he asked me for family dinners for those two days he was more of the tone like “if” I can join and not that he wanted to me show up. In my head I thought- I have already been there for him for the last couple of days, now it’s time for me to show up for my friends and me (just for those 2 days). I had no intention of abandoning him in any way and whether he asked me or not- I was gonna be there for him for the rest of the days. Now his argument is that since he asked me- I showed up and that didn’t feel genuine to him. 

Iam left feeling like I did everything in my capacity and poured a lot of me into this relationship but in the end he invalidated all of my efforts.

1knqqy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1knqqy6/what_more_can_i_do_to_lose_weight/,What more can I do to lose weight?,"Hello!

I'm in my late 20s and male. I used to weigh around 120 kg and managed to bring it down to 107, but I’ve recently gone back up to 110. I've been accepted for a scholarship and would really like to reach around 100 kg (ideally 95 kg if I push hard) by mid-September. I know that’s quite ambitious, but I just want to see consistent weight loss to keep myself motivated.

I walk about 10,000 steps a day (tracked with a pedometer) at a speed of 4.7 km/h. On some days, I use the treadmill and hit around 20,000 steps, those days my average speed hits around 5.2 km/h. I walk to and from work. While my job is mostly desk-based, I'm fairly active overall.

I lift weights at least 3 times a week and up to 5 times when my schedule allows. I train using a Push-Pull-Legs (PPL) split and lift fairly heavy. For example, I leg press about 120 kg, my back exercises (rows and pulls) are around 60 kg, and my chest press is currently at 80 kg. I’ve seen noticeable muscle development in my chest, arms, and legs—but I’m still holding onto weight around my stomach, and it’s very noticeable.

I’m trying to stick to a calorie deficit, but I often end up eating more—especially after intense workouts. I used to consume about 1500 calories a day before I started training, and dropping below that has been tough. I went down to 1200 calories for a while, which worked initially, but I’m afraid I’ll have to go even lower, which doesn’t feel sustainable.

I prepare my own meals and use as little oil as possible. My diet is mostly protein-heavy, and I use low-fat milk in my coffee whenever I can. My diet is low carb and full of vegetables mostly.

1knqqtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizotypal/comments/1knqqtl/accidentally_used_this_community_to_fuel_possibly/,Accidentally used this community to fuel possibly psychosis,"Tl;Dr treated schizotypal like a club for spiritual people with special abilities instead of the personality disorder it is and worsened my mental health. 

So I'm doing pretty good right now but last year I had a stressful time, started having a slowly growing amount of paranoia and a lot more sensing spiritual entities.... which kinda led me to thinking I had schizotypal cause it all fit(even though occasionally it mostly went away). 
But instead of taking the subreddit like a support group for people with a personality disorder I kinda just fit myself in since in my mind schizotypal people were just people who could genuinely sense entities and had some level or telepathy, and hey I can relate with everyone! 

(And I tried to be able to communicate with spiritual entities more while genuinely ignoring the times others said it was a symptom) 

Add in stress and I just snowballed with paranoia and alot more things. Then I realized schizotypas was an actual personality disorder, and I thought that I was clearly spiritual so I ""graduated"" to other communities with people just straight up not really suggesting they had an issue. (Thankfully I was still in spaces supportive of mental health). 
Heck I joined occult spaces on discord and got told to talk to a therapist cause I brought up telepathy... uh I eventually did. Mostly due to my paranoia just getting worse to the point that it started involving things recording my thoughts and I couldn't drink coffee at all without getting convinced of certain things. 

(All this would stop for a little when I stopped being stressed but eventually cMe back). For a lot of this time I was hearing voices when stressed and communicating to entities. 
And I talked to a therapist about my paranoia issues and added in info about the other stuff and... idk I'm making a choice not to go on any subreddits that are spiritual or related to weird thing.
Thing is I did have some small level of ""I have telepathy/I can practice and develop telekinesis"" it just was at a really low level and then I managed to make the whole thing skyrocket 

I'm fine now so I don't think it was me developing schizophrenia. I hope

Marco's pov

Homeroom felt more like a fridge than a classroom. The windows rattled faintly in their frames, and I could see the gum trees outside swaying in the wind like they were already giving up on summer. It was mid-February, technically still summer, but the cold had crept in early this year—sharp winds, grey skies, breath hanging just a little too long in the air.

Half the class had pulled their jumpers out from the bottom of their bags. Eren, predictably, still wore his hoodie like a security blanket. I had my blazer on, fingers curled around a warm travel mug my mum insisted I take this morning. Apple and cinnamon tea. It helped.

I was halfway through rewriting my Modern History summary notes when the door opened.

Ms. Ral walked in, clipboard tucked under her arm, followed by someone new. Heads turned. Chairs creaked. Even Sasha paused mid-sip of her iced coffee.

“We’ve got a new student joining us today,” Ms. Ral said. “Transferred in from Trost. This is Jean Kirstein. Play nice.”

Jean looked like he’d rather be anywhere else. Tall, lean, sharp-edged. His brown hair was styled back but wind-blown from the walk across the quad. His uniform was technically correct, but his tie was loose and the top button of his shirt undone. The sleeves of his blazer were slightly too long, like he hadn’t had time to get it tailored.

Ms. Ral looked at me next.

“Marco, he’s your buddy. Show him around, help him settle in.”

I nodded instinctively. “Yes, ma'am.”

Jean glanced toward the empty seat beside me with the expression of someone sizing up a lifeboat they didn’t ask for. But he walked over and sat down, dropping his bag beside his chair with a soft thump.

“Hey,” I offered, smiling. “I’m Marco.”

He gave a small nod. “Jean.”

The chill in the room didn’t just come from the air conditioning. Jean sat stiffly, arms crossed, staring ahead like he was bracing for something. He didn’t take his books out, just looked out the window, jaw tense. I wasn’t sure if it was nerves or something else, but I didn’t push.

Ms. Ral moved on to attendance and updates, the usual Monday stuff. I could hear Hitch whisper something behind me and giggle—probably about the new guy. People were already whispering. Transfers in Year 12 weren’t normal, and Jean didn’t exactly scream “open book.”

When the bell rang, I stood and looked over at him.

“First period’s English,” I said. “It’s in C Block. Want me to show you?”

Jean stood slowly. “Yeah. Thanks.”

We walked out into the hallway together. The breeze cut through the open walkway like a knife, and both of us instinctively tucked our chins deeper into our collars.

“You got stuck with English, History, PE, and Legal, right?” I asked.

“Pretty much whatever was open,” he said. “Didn’t get much of a say.”

“Still no math, though. So that’s a win.”

That got the faintest curve of a smile from him.

The path between buildings was scattered with dry leaves—brown, brittle, crunching under our shoes. The air smelled faintly of damp eucalyptus and cold metal. Jean didn’t talk much, but he kept pace with me.

“Is it weird starting over now?” I asked.

Jean shrugged. “Better than staying where I was.”

I didn’t ask what that meant. Yet.

When we reached the English room, I held the door open.

“This is 12C English,” I said. “Mr. Jinn teaches it. He’s a bit dramatic, but he’ll like you if you quote anything vaguely literary.”

Jean stepped in, paused, then looked at me with something more like curiosity than discomfort.

“You always this helpful?”

I shrugged. “Occupational hazard.”

He looked at me for a moment, like he didn’t quite know what to make of me.

Then: “Thanks.”

Short, quiet—but it felt like something real.

And for now, that was enough.

The classroom smelled faintly of old paper and dry-erase markers, warmed by the heater humming softly in the corner. Jean and I took seats near the middle of the room—me by habit, him because he followed.

Mr. Jinn strode in two minutes after the bell, wearing a navy turtleneck and thick glasses that always slid halfway down his nose. He clapped his hands once like he was commanding attention on a stage.

“Today,” he announced, “we’re writing poetry. Don’t groan. This isn’t Shakespeare. This is you.”

A few people groaned anyway. Sasha laid her head dramatically on her desk. Jean just blinked.

“I want a single free verse poem,” Mr. Jinn continued, “based on your life right now. One page max. Doesn’t need to rhyme, but it does need to feel honest.”

I stared down at my notebook.

Honest.

A dozen university brochures flashed through my head—emails from places I couldn’t even point to on a map, application deadlines highlighted in neon on the family calendar, late nights spent wondering if I was making decisions for the right reasons or just making them because everyone expected me to.

I picked up my pen.

“Decision Season”
By Marco Bodt
They say I could go anywhere.
Across oceans, over borders, through ivy-covered halls.
Oxford. Keio. UBC. ANU.
They say I’m wanted.
They say I’m lucky.
They say I should be excited.
But mostly, I’m tired.
Mostly, I feel like a resume
shaped like a seventeen-year-old.
Every choice feels like a fork in a forest I’ve never been to.
And all I want is to breathe without thinking about tomorrow.
Just for one day.

I stopped writing. The class was quiet except for scratching pens and the occasional sniffle. I glanced sideways at Jean, who was still staring at his blank page like it had personally offended him.

He noticed me looking and muttered, “I don’t do poetry.”

I smiled faintly. “Lucky for you, Jinn just wants honesty.”

Jean looked at me like that was the bigger challenge.

I don’t know what I expected when I walked into the library for my first tutoring session—maybe a Year 10 kid nervously flipping through a textbook, or someone shy who’d pretend not to understand basic algebra just to get out of doing it.

What I didn’t expect was Eren Yeager.

He was already there when I arrived, slouched in a seat like it had personally offended him. Hood up, legs sprawled, his backpack dumped on the floor like it exploded on impact. He looked like he was waiting for detention, not help.

“You’re my tutor?” he said the moment he saw me, raising one eyebrow like it was the most personally disappointing news he’d ever received.

I sat down across from him. “Apparently.”

We’d been in the same classes for years, but we weren’t exactly close. He was loud. I was quiet. He argued with teachers. I didn’t. He once threw a desk leg at a whiteboard when a relief teacher got Stalin and Lenin mixed up. It missed, but the message landed.

“Great,” he muttered. “Just great.”

I pulled my folder out and tried to sound neutral. “I’ve got your progress sheet here. Looks like you’re falling behind in Modern History.”

“No shit.”

There was a beat of silence. I glanced at the study guide. “So. The Cold War?”

He leaned back in his chair like it might protect him from the next forty-five minutes.

“Can you just… I don’t know. Tell me what I need to know so I don’t fail?”

It was tempting to recite the syllabus and walk away, but that wasn’t the job. And, stupidly, I kind of wanted to prove I could do this.

“Alright,” I said, flipping to a page I’d highlighted earlier. “Let’s start simple. Do you know what the Iron Curtain is?”

“Yeah,” he said immediately. “A metal curtain that—like—cut Europe in half or whatever.”

I blinked. “No.”

He frowned. “Well, I thought I knew.”

“It’s a metaphor, Eren.”

“Oh. Well maybe don’t ask trick questions, Marco.”

I sighed and kept going.

Tutoring Eren was like teaching a very talkative Labrador with no attention span. Every time I explained something, he interrupted with a question that spiraled into a conspiracy theory, a rant about how school was designed to crush people’s souls, or an aggressively personal opinion about American foreign policy.

But the weirdest part was… he stayed.

And listened.

And sometimes, he got it.

I drew a cartoon on the back of a worksheet—two guys yelling over a TV remote, each claiming they had the right to change the channel while the other refused to back down. “This is the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the Cold War,” I said. “Both want influence. Neither wants to give it up.”

Eren stared at it. Then snorted.

“That’s actually kind of good.”

I blinked. “Wait, really?”

“Yeah. Like, it’s stupid—but it works.”

By the end of the session, he’d filled in a worksheet. Badly, but it was filled. That alone felt like a miracle. As we packed up, he looked at me sideways.

“You’re not as annoying as I thought you’d be.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I think.”

He nodded toward the paper. “Same time next week?”

I wasn’t sure if it was a threat or a question. “Sure.”

He left the library in the same chaotic swirl of limbs he arrived with.

I sat there a few minutes longer, watching the dust float through the light, feeling a little less like I was falling behind myself. Maybe this tutoring thing wouldn’t fix everything. But it was something real. Something mine.

And for now, that was enough.

After Eren left the library like a one-man hurricane, I packed up slowly, feeling weirdly… okay.

Not proud, exactly. But like I’d done something that mattered, even if it was just convincing Eren Yeager that Stalin and Lenin weren’t cousins. I slipped my notes into my folder and headed down the hall toward Student Services to log the session.

The admin office smelled like dry paper and weak instant coffee. I nodded at the receptionist, who didn’t look up from her screen, then stepped into the side room labeled Tutoring Program – Logs and Hours. It was basically a glorified storage closet with a sign-in folder and a couple of clipboards hanging from thumbtacks.

As I started filling out the form—Name: Marco Bodt. Session type: Peer tutoring. Subject: Modern History. Notes: Iron Curtain / Cold War basics—I heard voices drifting in from the open admin office.

Two teacher aides were talking just outside the doorway.

“I heard they’re transferring him from one of the city schools,” one said, voice low but not exactly secretive. “Something about family stuff, maybe behavioural? Poor kid’s been bounced around like crazy.”

“Is he from interstate?”

“Mm, maybe. I saw paperwork for Sydney. But the application had European documents too—France or Switzerland or something? It’s all kind of vague.”

“Do we know when he’s starting?”

“Term’s already halfway in. Could be anytime.”

They both went quiet for a moment, then one of them added, “Honestly, if they want him to settle, this school might be the first place that sticks. Sina High’s got its mess, but at least we try.”

There was a rustle of papers. A door closed softly.

I stood there for a few seconds, pen still in hand. I don’t know why I felt the need to listen so closely. It wasn’t like I knew whoever they were talking about.

But something about it stuck in my head.

Maybe it was the way they said “settle,” like this person had been drifting for a while. Or maybe it was because, despite all my lists and plans and university pamphlets, I knew a little bit about feeling unmoored.

I logged the time, capped the pen, and left the room.

I've been on ADHD meds which have helped with focus (albeit not so much with dexterity issues). I recently started taking supplements daily because why not (about a month ago), and about a week ago I noticed I felt way different. 
I feel less craving or obsessive with regard to buying stuff or food—I get some anhedonia that people talk about, and given my mood swings that does concern me, but I do like that I eat or buy things more intentionally, rather than buying stuff out of low impulse control and a craving for dopamine. I’m not totally protected from mood swings but I feel more resilient, more assertive and more confident as well as more goal-driven; on the whole I feel more “manly”, but in a mature way rather than something cartoony. 
I do still sometimes get the overthinking and “analysis paralysis” comes with OCD, which really can drive alot of bad decisions, but it does seem to happen less; the intrusive thoughts are much less common. As mentioned before, I still do get mood swings at time—(I found out coffee treats that way better than energy drinks, as a side note).

I suspect alot of these changes are driven by the ashwagandha (I take 600 mg of KSM-66, for reference). I’ve noticed I feel groggy throughout much of the day—researched and found out I should take it at night instead.

I wanted advice on how adding in l-theanine would help me or hinder me, and/or further advice with ashwagandha (“cycling it” as I’ve heard people talk about)

I spoke to a financial advisor and he advised to keep putting money in to broad etf funds and max out my pension every year, and to make a gia and an sipp and to look into bonds but I really don’t have much clue where to start, and am also thinking about whether due to my young age I should try to capitalise on this opportunity and start a business or something (coffee shop seems fun) or if I should just be really boring with my money.",0,1747363490.0,FIREUK,0,0.5,False

1knq9zx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knq9zx,My Idea for a Yandere Simulator Remake,"Ayano would use her 2014 concept design
with this hairstyle. 

The Aishi condition would no longer be a thing and Ayano would slowly develop a condition where she can barely form emotion due to being neglected by her mother and abused by her father.

Student Council would wear a beige blazer seen on the Game Asset Studio Models

There'd be Four Rivals
- Kokona
- Oka
- Asu
- Megami

Canon Elimination
Kokona - Befriend
Oka - Suicide
Asu - Drowning
Megami - Ruining her Reputation Enough to Move Schools

Time Frame

Fall/Winter of 2014

Kokona on September 15th-19th
Oka on October 17th-22nd
Asu on November 4th-7th
Megami on December 24th-29th

The days during the week where you're not attending school you can spend stalking the rival, working as a barista in a coffee shop, going into town to buy things, and torturing people.

Kokona's Befriend Mission

Kokona would converse with Saki while Ayano is Spying on them as usual. Ayano would arrange a meeting with Kokona discussing her Father's debt. Once Ayano figures out who is responsible for this she'll sneak into the Rokuda household in the middle of the night. There she'd suffocate Mutsumi to death, hide her corpse in a giant suitcase, and bring it to Ayano's home. You'd take Mutsumi's corpse, stitch her eyelids open, and pose her as if she were screaming. Take an image of her and send it anonymously through a burner phone with a vpn to Mr. Rokuda. Ayano'd threaten him to free all his clients from debt and ask him for 985,000 Yen. He'd send her the money anonymously to a discreet location. Ayano would dispose of Mutsumi's Corpse by dumping it into a river and pick up the envelope of cash. 


Effects of Mutsumi's Passing
Due to Mutsumi no longer attending the school, the bullies would be led by Hoshiko Mizudori. Hoshiko is much crueler than Mutsumi and attempts to manipulate the other three bullies remaining into doing more extreme methods of ""bullying"" such as burning students with cigarettes and lighters, cutting them up with sharp objects, and beating them with items around the school. Kokoro sees through Hoshiko and decides to leave the bullies which makes her a target for bullying. Kokoro decides to join the occult club.

Megami's Canon Elimination

Megami wouldn't be the perfect girl we all know in the current game. She'd have a shorter temper and make a few mistakes every now and then. You could spy on Megami and take images of her doing things such as tripping and spilling things onto other people. You'd be able to print these images out and hang them around the school which will lower her Reputation. One of the student council members will discuss this during lunch time (Most likely Shiromj) which will cause Megami to lash out at her. You could record this out of context and edit it by joining the Photography club. Then you could send this to the bullies phones and previous friends you've made (Minimum is Kokona as in this AU she'd be loud mouthed and can't keep a secret). Megami would be bullied so relentlessly that she'd no longer want to attend the high school and would withdraw. Leaving Kuroko as the president as no one else was involved in the election.

During the Student council election, the school would go through a massive renovation, there'd be atleast 2 or 3 students joining the school every two days, and students would become much more intelligent. An example of renovation would be curtains around every window including doors, desks being separated from chairs, every chair having wheels, and better lighting in the school. Students would be able to notice blood and bodies much more quickly due to this new lighting and would have much better hearing than previously. Students can now also see through windows which is where curtains come in. Classrooms would also be locked during lunch time and unlocked during class time. Students would also be able to distinguish a regular trash bag and a body bag now. Students council will also now tase Ayano after two pushes instead of four like normal.



Endings

There'd be three

- Genocide ending
- Snap Ending (Two Ways)
- Jail Ending (Canon)

The Snap ending would be either achieved through how it is normally in game, or through the ending by catching Taro (I will elaborate on this)

Jail Ending is a reference to Yuka Takaoka (The IRL Yandere) where Ayano spies on Taro at work and sees him speaking with a Female Co Worker. Later that night, she'd stab Taro with a kitchen knife into him abdomen. He'd run out of their home into a blizzard and attempts to run towards the nearest hospital. He passes out near a local police station where they discover him and immediately take him to the ER. Upon waking up, Taro would be question on what happened where'd he'd confess that Ayano was the person whom he'd been attacked by. She'd be promptly arrested and sentenced to either life in prison or sent to a mental asylum (Haven't decided Yet) There'd be a chase sequence where you can successfully chase after and catch Taro trying to run away. You'd tackle him and get into a fight which ends in you slitting both Taro's and your throats.",3,1747363203.0,RyobaAishi,2,1.0,False

Beautiful, spoiled, well-spoken, and dangerous in the sweetest way.

You’re here because you need something.
My attention. My voice. My approval.
Or maybe you’re just hoping I’ll humiliate the part of you you’re too ashamed to show anyone else.

I don’t just want your money.
I want your submission in every form it comes in.

🖤 What I Enjoy:
	•	Financial Domination – I take because I can. You give because you need to.
	•	Humiliation & Degradation – Soft words or sharp cruelty, depending on what you deserve.
	•	Drain sessions & voice calls – I talk, you melt. You pay, I take.
	•	Obedience play, control, and training – I mold weak minds into devoted pets.
	•	Worship – Feet, voice, intellect, and superiority. Choose your altar.



💸 My Ideal Submissive:
	•	You give consistently without whining or conditions.
	•	You understand that Findom is about loss of control, not bargaining.
	•	You crave being used, teased, or put in your place whether that’s playful embarrassment or something more intense.
	•	You get hard knowing I’ll forget your name but keep your money.


🧋 Roles I Love Having in My Lineup:
	•	Coffee/food subs who pay for my cravings
	•	Long-term tributers who quietly send without fuss
	•	Voice-obsessed weaklings who pay just to hear me drain them
	•	Debt contract boys who need structure & punishment
	•	Humiliation pets who get off being reminded they’ll never be enough
	•	Big spenders who need a Black Goddess to break them

I may already have some of these 
But I’m always open to more if you’re obedient, consistent, and know your place.


📎 How to Approach:
	1.	Start with tribute. No tribute = no attention.
	2.	Introduce yourself with purpose. Who are you? What do you crave?
	3.	Be real. Be ready. No “maybe later” energy here.



You’re not just paying me.
You’re paying for the privilege of proximity.
Make your presence worth my attentionor stay a silent admirer.

these kind of people want a lion to climb trees, a monkey to roar and hunt elephants, cuz they themselves are not aware what to ask and whom to ask but are not ready to take any advise from people who know the stuff  
\-> **The micro manager founder**  
they lack trust in their employees and try to dig into each and every minute thing, focusing less on the right things which actually add value  
\-> **The gaslighting founder**  
they are understaffed and overload employees with a lot of work and gaslight employees into toxic late hours, create fake urgencies almost every other day  
\-> **The Aladdin(genie version) founder**  
especially founders with almost 0 technical knowledge of stuff, they don't understand the process, timeline,  and how, why and when things are to be done, they just have an attitude like you read a magic spell and booom, the product gets shipped  
\-> **The Aladdin(dictator version) founder**  
they own their employees, the employees are basically paid slave, they might lock you out of office if you come a bit late, they might ask a software developer to get coffee for them, you are paid by them so you are bound to satisfy their ego and lick their boots and what not  
\-> **The freeloaders**  
what have you done ? are you building a rocket here ? so just keep 2 cents and be happy that you are even employed by me. they don't want to pay decently and make you feel like you are not worth it  
a very common thing among these founders is **hire and fire quick, no stability**  
so what is common in these companies, that might kill the startup:  
\-> good/skilled employees never stay for long, they are out at the first opportunity they get  
\-> the products becomes extremely shitty if the talent is unfit, or too may people work for very short period of time and on tight deadlines, then they leave, so this pattern makes the codebase a pile of p\*g shit no body likes to work with  
\-> there is always a sense of fear, everyday employees are insecure about their job and worried about their bills/responsibilities, so basically a very bad environment for any good thing to be accomplished  
\-> firing someone who knows ins and outs of the product, better luck finding the right replacement as quickly as possible without impacting growth. there is always a guy or a small group, they run the show there, so if you bite them, it will make things harder  
\-> relying too much on jr talent for critical decisions, they don't have the right amount of experience and some mistakes can impact you heavily, so respect experience and let the right people do the job  
\-> don't set your hiring criteria like FAANG, if you pay like Tom's bakery, it's a two way street, if you are having standards, then people with good skills do have them, so try to find a balance",1,1747362522.0,cscareerquestions,0,0.67,False

It wasn't my resume. It wasn't my experience. It was how I was practicing.

For months, I'd been doing what everyone recommends—talking to my computer screen, recording myself, using those AI interview prep tools. But my breakthrough came when I stopped talking to pixels and started talking to people.

**Here's what I discovered:** The key to nailing interviews isn't just preparation—it's HUMAN preparation. 

When you practice with an actual person (literally anyone will do), your entire approach changes. Your responses become more fluid, your personality shines through, and you appear significantly more relaxed and confident.

## The Simple Method That Changed Everything

1. Find ANY adult—friend, family member, former colleague, neighbor, barista at your local coffee shop
2. Ask for just 10-15 minutes of their time
3. Give them a list of 10-15 common interview questions
4. Have them ask these questions randomly
5. Respond exactly as you would in a real interview

The difference is immediate and dramatic. You practice maintaining eye contact, reading social cues, adjusting your tone based on reactions, and managing your facial expressions and body language—none of which happens when you're talking to your laptop camera.

I've noticed that whenever I go a few weeks without this kind of practice, my interview performance tanks. But a quick 15-minute session with my neighbor or cousin gets me back in fighting form.

This might seem stupidly simple, but if you're struggling with interviews despite having good qualifications, this could be the missing piece. Our brains are wired for human connection, not computer screens.

1knpxpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1knpxpd/living_such_a_healthy_lifestyle_to_feel_so_foggy/,"Living such a healthy lifestyle to feel so foggy, drained, out of it","I'm a 34 year old father of 3. I work and live what would be considered a textbook ""middle class lifestyle."" I'm a High School educator and football coach, live in a brick ranch in the suburbs, enjoy mowing my lawn, etc. I am a former college athlete and I did let myself go after that until around 2019 when I was 250 lbs. Since 2019 I got back on a very healthy diet and exercise regimen and I've stayed around 165-170 lbs for the past 4 years. I'm at a 9% body fat currently. In 2021 I ditched all soda from my life (I used to be an ardent Mtn Dew drinker but drifted to Coke Zero because of ""NO CALORIES""). Still, even though I was active, ate well, and had basically perfect labs, I still struggled with what I felt was my energy and an often times foggy mind.

In June 2024 I decided to discontinue taking my SSRI (Lexapro 10mg) that I had been on for 8 years. I had a Hyponatremia emergency in 2016 that really messed with my fight or flight response and the best solution the doctors came up with at the time was it was treatable through an antidepressant because the symptoms presented themselves as General Anxiety. I wanted to see if this was what was lowering my energy and I knew it was devastatingly cratering my libido. I did not taper as long as I should have; I have a very ""do it all now or don't do it at all"" mentality. I was off Lexapro completely by the 4th of July in 2024. That was not an enjoyable experience but honestly I'd say by August I was feeling good. In-fact I remember stating that I didn't notice a  negative difference (and saw positives!). By the end of fall I was noticing my stress levels were increasing yet I still had my Zyn that I would have in my mouth all the time. Even at work when I was on prep or my lunch I would have one in. When my infant was screaming at 3am I'd gladly get up with him because I'd just throw a pouch in and start my day. Still, my energy levels and all that seemed off. Had another round of blood work done at my annual physical and everything was ""as normal as one could hope for"" at my age.

In November I took an inventory of things I wanted to change to really get to a fully healthy lifestyle (and see if it'll get myself back to what I think is tip top shape). The biggest things I noticed were that 1. I do not sleep a lot due to having a baby in some form for the past 5 years keeping us awake. 2. I was using a THC pen every night to help sleep. I never had an issue falling asleep but the pen would just knock me out in 3 or less minutes and I thought that was better than tossing and turning or doom scrolling. 3. I was still consuming a lot of artificial sweetness in the form of the gum and mints I consume and the stuff that was in Zyn. 3. The biggest of them all: QUITTING ZYN.

Come November 15th 2024 I quit Zyn cold-turkey. I tried some replacement therapy stuff with TeaZa, Smokey Mountain, and Jake's Mint Chew and none of them really did much. I tried an Ashwaganda and Rhodiola supplementation but that did not seem to help either my anxiety or withdrawls despite the fact that I put myself through it for a month on and a month off and repeated that 2x! I quit THC. I now only use Xylitol gum and Simply Mints. Sleeping still isn't great. Quitting Zyn was awful, yet, I noticed come March I still hadn't had a single pouch.

Now here I am 6 months later. According to the Quitty! app I have avoided 2800 pouches and saved close to $1000. However, I can't help notice lately I really just want to go back to it. I quit Grizzly back in 2016 for exactly 6 months as well (while I was going through the Hyponatremia fallout), but relapsed around this time. I think my biggest struggle has been that despite the massive amount of changes I have made in the past year, the only things I've really noticed changing are that:

My health really is unchanged (haven't gained any weight thankfully) but my resting heart rate was around 55-60 prior and it still is there now. My blood pressure was around 110-115/75-80. I find myself getting way more irritated at simple things and overall less happy. I was told back in 2021 that I really needed to cut specific things out of my life in order to truly be healthy and I quote ""You will not believe how great you feel when you eliminate artificial sweeteners, tobacco, THC."" I think back and I am jealous of how good I had it back then. I had so many instant dopamine options at my disposal (and I had an SSRI on top of that).

In addition to working at a school I am also a clinically licensed mental health professional so I'm so aware of how a lot of this works or how we in the community understand brain health. I know that based on all that I've eliminated it can take 18-24 months to ""really"" see the changes. However I just think I really want the instant calming effect that Zyn had. I know I'm romanticizing it because it wasn't as good as I remember, but damn was it and other things a crutch.

I still find myself very happy when I'm with my kids, coaching, and other things. I still do interval trianing 4-5 days a week and lift 2-3 days a week as well. The one thing I noticed most is I cannot sit still now or I begin to either want to doze off and fall asleep or my mind is racing. So I am always constantly moving and when my mind is occupied I'm doing well. Like I've felt fine while typing all of this. But, if I was not super engaged like I was here I would be thinking about why things don't feel ""right.""

For just a little more context here is my normal week:

Here is my overall day with diet and everything else so you have a full picture per se.

Monday-Friday:

I wake up around 5:45 AM. This can be changed if one of my kids wake up but I am usually up around this time. I get dressed for work. I take one Thorne Stress B Complex capsule and 1 tbsp of Organic Apple Cider vinegar. I usually am listening to a podcast but not on headphones. I have my breakfast which I prepare the night before. The breakfast is a smoothie made up of: 8 oz of unsweet vanilla almond milk. 1/2 cup of Oikos Triple Zero Vanilla yogurt. 4 TBSP of Naked Double Chocolate Protein Powder 4 TBSP of Simple Truth Organic Peanut Butter powder 1/2 of a frozen banana blended with ice. I drink that and then pack up and drive to work with my lunch, gym bag, and coffee. My commute to work is less than 5 minutes. 

I work as a school social worker at suburban high school. It allows for a lot of interaction with students and staff but also a ton of time on a computer due to paperwork. I usually drink my 20 oz tumbler of coffee between 7:45 and 9:00 am. My coffee is brewed at home in a standard 12 cup coffee maker. I use 1/2 cup of medium roast coffee grounds to make the 12 cup pot. During the work day around 11-11:15 I will go to the school cafeteria and eat two bags of the small packs of sliced apples and a bag of baby carrots. Around 12:30 or as late as 1:00 I eat my lunch. My lunch everyday is 1 romaine lettuce hairt, 1 ounce of baby spring mix, 2 hounces of rainbow shredded carrots, 2 ounces of matchstix radish, 1/3 of a chopped cucumber, 1.5 oz of chopped whole mushrooms. 1/2 cup of spinach and arugula mix. 3 oz of chicken breast and 3-4 tbsp of simple truth organic creamy parmasan dressing. At the end of the school day I spend most of the school year coaching. I coach JV football which is the biggest time commitment in the fall. Middle school basketball in the winter and middle school track and field in the spring. The latter being the ""ligthest"" of the coaching responsibilities. 

During the football season I exercise usually exclusively at night tiem after the kids go to bed. In the spring I will sometimes work out after practice or fit it in maybe in a lunch hour. My workouts consist of lifting (Shaun T Dig Deeper program modified is what I currently am using) 3-4x a week and then Insanity Max30 cardio is done around 6x a week. A full workout session of lifting and cardio lasts around 65 minutes with 430-500 calories burned. A just max30 cardio session usually is 35-38 minutes with around 300-330 calories burned. I try and drink ultima replenisher after for electroylite replenishment and just recently have tried to have transparent labs 100% whey one scoop to help with muscle growth and recovery. Frankly I haven't done grat at having the protein but I'm working on it.

When I get home from work it's usually pretty chaotic. Between making dinner cleaning up from dinner, laundry, playing with the kids, kids showers and bed time, prepping breakfast and clothes for the next day. That whole process usually ends around 8:30-9:00. Sometimes I work out after that or I did so earlier in the day. I'm usually in bed around 10:30-11:15. I do have a bowl of simple truth organic honey nut cheerois and I do know that is something that isn't the greatest (do not have any milk with it just dry cereal). I usually fall asleep within 2 minutes of trying to fall asleep but I do have a bad habit of being on my phone in the bed for like 10 minutes. For years I used a THC cart pen before bed that would knock me out to sleep very quickly. Recently I have quit doing that on the regular to try and see if that was impacting my energy and overall mood. Jury is out on if that makes a difference and occasionally I will take a few puffs still of it before bed. My sleep can be okay or pretty broken depending on how often I'm awoken by our children. My wife and I are stressed a lot and it can be very hectic in our home. Thankfully we are in a good financial situation and that has eased some stress.

The weekends aren't always following a routine but we do go to mass each week. Usually at 10:30 sunday and we have family breakfast before that. The rest of it is busy a lot with grocery shopping, activities, and all. Like I said I do like to have a couple light beers on fridays and saturdays but only after the kids are in bed and tasks are complete. I am very task driven and can do mostly anything around the house even with little sleep. I find that when I go go go I don't think about stuff too often. It's when I'm not actively active that I really notice the stuff with my body (for example when I'm at my desk at work, driving, etc.) or when I'm super stimulated and stressed.  I can be exhausted yet still able to do a full one hour 500 calorie burning workout. 

I forgot to mention for dinner we usually have some sort of chicken or beef meal with a vegetable and starch. We do not drink any soda and all I consume is water and coffee. I forgot to mention that I will have sometimes an additional 2 or so small cups of coffee throughout the day depending on how I feel my energy level is.

I just want to be sharp, have more energy and clearer sights both physically and mentally.

She loves that kind of tea"" so here I am

Buckle up it's looooonggg!! Hi! You can call me Zab (25F) my cousin Shai also (25F) is getting married, I've got an Invitation so is my whole family, (Mom, Dad, 2sis 21 and 19) I'm actually expecting that I'm just gonna sit beside my mom but I'm wrong, I'm one of the BMs! I am BEYOND surprised, I'm SHOCKED! First we're not close enough and second we barely talk, u asking why? Because she's kinda mean growing up, I beg my mom not to send me in the same high school she's in. Fast forward after 2 weeks, she made a group chat with the other BMs and MOH all of the BMs is unfamiliar, maybe her friends in college or anyone, the only familiar in there is my cousin Charlie (24F) she's her MOH. That's also surprising. Charlie is sweet, kind, people pleaser, successful and a relatives favorite (she's also my favorite) also never talked to her, MOH is supposed to be the closest to the bride but Charlie and Shai never even spoke before. Back to the group chat she messaged us that she's not gonna pay for our dress because there's already a lot of expenses they need to pay, we all agreed. The dress cost us 2k each, nevertheless it's beautiful no one complaints, for the fitting we need to meet at a coffee shop near her house because it's convenient for her still we all agreed, even though it's Tuesday at 10am (Work day and time) some of the BMs need to take a day off for work, it's fine for them, then she told us about the bachelorette trip in Vegas, the itinerary is so good it's ALMOST that you can't say no, the only problem about that trip is it cost 15grand+ it's ridiculously high because the hotel that she wants cause 5grand a night. She said she's not gonna help paying it because it's already our gift to her for the bachelorette party, we didn't need to give anything else. No one replies. 15k is a ridiculous amount even if all of the 9 girls pinch in. One of the BMs ""Chloe"" says the price is to expensive, she didn't know if she can afford it that's when Shai let out one of her true colors, she started cursing and embarrassing Chloe in the group chat and started calling her a poor dirty bi'ch. I'm not surprised abt that, she's a spoiled brat who gets whatever she wants so when she doesn't, she wouldn't control herself and threw a fit like a child. I told her to stop and I'm just gonna pay for it, but they just need to pay for their own expense for the trip. They all dm's me to say thank you but Shai kicked Chloe out of the group chat, remember Chloe she's gonna be important for later. Anyway 2 days before the bachelorette trip Charlie called me, saying she's been meaning to ask something. I got suspicious. We talked about a lot of things in the phone then she asked ""How many guests do you think Shai has?"" Her mom told my mom there's gonna be above 300 or 400 idk so i did tell her that. Fast forward to the bachelorette trip, I all meet the bridesmaids in the airport, Shai's not with us she's in business class. Me and the other BMs and Charlie talked while boarding and we had a great time not until one of them tells us that they're not really close to Shai so they're worrying that it's gonna be awkward, now there's no need for them to worry because even though they're not really close to Shai they have us. Charlie and I looked at each other, because we know that even us is not close to her. WTAF??? WTH is happening, BMs and MOH isn't her circles?? How about her friends?? Some of the BMs told us that Shai's their BOSS at WORK that's why she's so mad at Chloe because she knows how much is she making. THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED THAT CHARLIE AND I IS ONE OF HER MOST SUCCESSFUL COUSIN. WTH?! I didn't say anything but that just didn't made sense at all. 

(I earns 400-500k annually I'm a CTO and Charlie earns 600-700k I'm not sure) just to give context 

TO THE BACHELORETTE PARTY 

We're all having fun Shai's being an angel and sweet. I still bring a gift so is all of the rest. She's so happy with all our gift and says she's really lucky to have us as her bridal party, maybe she wasn't bad at all i thought. When everyone was having fun Shai called us because she wanted to thank us properly.

""First everyone thank you for all of you and how wonderful you were to me, this wedding is messing with my mental health but because of you guys everything is going easy thank you. Thank you also Zab for paying the hotel you were so nice loveyou. Also a special thank you for Charlie for accepting my request to pay for the catering"" she said something like this but even more longer

WT? I looked at Charlie but she still looks awkward when we all turn our heads to her. After that Shai and some of the girls went back to partying but as a curious cat I ask Charlie about the catering and if she needs some help. Then she started telling me about the conversationt that she has with Shai, she said at first Shai only ask her to pay HALF it's fine for her because she's still her cousin and she loves doing favors for family. I asked her how much is the cater then I learned that it's from a 4 star restaurant ( you probably hear this restaurant in some of the famous influencer and famous celebrities like the Kardashians) It Cost 31k but 2 days before the trip Shai called her to say it's already been paid for because the restaurant needs advance payment, so she ask Charlie to just reimburse her, but because she already paid it, she ask Charlie to cover the whole 31k even though hesitating Charlie said yes. I felt bad for her. It's not her wedding but she's already spending so much money. Fast forward we got home and everyone enjoyed the Vegas trip

After not so long we were informed that Charlie is not the MOH anymore. It's Chloe now, yes Chloe. I immediately called Charlie and she said that Shai already ask her about it and she said ""I think it's a good idea"" because it's an easier job to be a BM. So she's fine with it I'm fine with it. The gals told me that Chloe got a promotion and suddenly they become besties, still no words. Charlie's still paying for the catering and nothing change except the positions. After a few hours, Shai called me I answered 

""Hi Zab are you busy"" 

""No, what's up?"" 

""Can I ask you a favor? Please say yes"" 

""Uhm I guess, what is it?"" 

""I have a dream wedding cake and my budget's really tight because y'know everything is expensive, can you pay for it? Not that you have to"" she laugh. Her exact words 

""Uhm yeah sure, do you need anything else? "" 

"" OHMYGODD 'scream' thank you so much, also haha can you cover the gown? I mean if it's not too much?""

"" Oh yeah uhm how much is it?""

"" Oh only 27k, but it's already paid you can just venmo me so you know""

"" Yeah...sure? but can I do that after the wedding? If that's alright ""

"" Oh absolutely, thank you Zab you're the best""

My phone is in auto recording in incoming calls so yep I've got that on record.

Fast forward a week before the wedding she told everyone that were gonna have a spa day ""her treat"" for the upcoming event. We all agreed. Fast forward to the spa. When we arrive everyone is there, we all hug and so on. Shai suddenly has an announcement before we proceed, she said she didn't want to ruin her mood in her wedding day so she didn't want to be disappointed with our gifts so she'll just say what she wants so there'll be no problem, She prepare the pictures of the gifts with their price on it. All of the gift she show them is expensive, it's all branded bag, shoes, customize dress, paid vecation etc. Then she goes to Charlie ""and for your gift Cha I want this necklace, see? It's beautiful"" Charlie's stunned i didn't see the necklace but base on Charlie's reaction it costs a lot, then she goes to me ""And for you Zab, here"" she showed me the photo, it's also a necklace that costs 100k+ WTFF?? That's when I've had enough of this BS I told her 

""I'm sorry I can't afford that, with the wedding gown and the cake, and also I already spent ten thousands of dollars in our vegas trip, I don't think I can add anything on my cart""

She frown like i said something ridiculous, and I saw the anger coming in her eyes, when she's about to speak Charlie cut her off saying 

"" Yeah actually me either, I couldn't spent 250k on a necklace, I mean it's not even my wedding but I already spending so much, 250k isn't a wedding gift anymore, it's just a luxury you didn't wanna pay for""

My jaw dropped! That's not very Charlie, she used to say yes to everything that Shai says to us even though it's too much, that's when Shai starts to make a scene. Screaming shouting and saying we were useless cousin and we were such a bi'ch for ganging up against her just because were helping her. I actually didn't mean for her to feel that way I just had enough. And for Charlie, I don't really know what's gotten into her, she's mad, I've never seen her that mad before. 

Shai's still raging like a beast, shouting and cursing at us. Everyone is looking at her because her voice is really really really loud. When the security arrives they escort her out and told us to leave the property, but before she the guard pulled her she shouts ""You know what F'CK THE BOTH OF YOU, You're no longer INVITED! the both of you!! F'CK YOU"" And yes, were uninvited. Charlie cried when we arrive at my car, she started saying sorry to me because she just had enough of it, and she's sorry for being mad but Shai's just too much. I know were wrong for addressing that in front of the gals but I just explode, she's taking advantage of everything just because she's getting married. The parents heard about what happened in the spa and Charlie's mom is furious apparently she's paying for the venue lol, it's so funny how Shai's still wanting Charlie's mom to pay for her venue but we all didn't go, so is my family and Charlie family 

Oh yeah lol I almost forgot this, Shai called us after the wedding asking for the money for catering, venue and gown lol. We told were not giving her any money because we weren't even in the wedding, and it's her wedding after all pay for it herself. Apparently she thought even after uninviting us we'll still pay for her wedding, were just not going and not giving her gifts. 



Ps. I didn't use our real names. Only my Nickname ""Zab"" and Charlie's nickname ""Cha""

1knpv9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToBeHero_X/comments/1knpv9h/soda_theory_a_theory_on_how_x_got_his_powers/,Soda Theory: A theory on how X got his powers,"I made a post here before, but I found some more information and want to share my thoughts on what I call ""Soda Theory"". It's basically a theory on how X got his powers. 

Part 1: Why is the X soda so important?

Ever since the very first concept trailer of TBHX, the X soda has played a very significant role. Not only does X specifically get excited when seeing it, but when he throws it, the camera zooms right in on the logo. In almost every episode of the show, the soda appears in some capacity, showing that it definitely plays an important role in the show, but we just don't know how yet.

Part 2: How TBHX relates to the other seasons

We know TBHX is the third season in the To Be Hero franchise. Now, the director has said there are no direct connections between the previous two, and this one, but he did say the themes are the same. This could mean anything, but we do know for a fact TBHX at least references the previous seasons, as in the concept trailer, X stands on a sign that displays the logo of season 1. Now in season 2, To Be Heroine, the antagonist uses a soda that was capable of brainwashing the entire town into believing him. You can probably see where this is going.

Part 3: Foreshadowing similarities

In To Be Heroine, the soda being crucial to the plot was foreshadowed in many ways. One of the main ways was through subtle advertisement. Not only would characters drink the soda in almost every episode, but posters of the soda would always appear everywhere. Of course, we never know the soda was crucial until near the end, but it was foreshadowed from the very beginning. Very similar to the X soda.

Part 4: Where does X work?

We know X works is a business man in some sort of corporate office as seen in his character trailer. I think we can get some hints from this trailer as to his specific job though. He grabs a coffee mug with a logo on it. The logo was purple, pink, and blue. It doesn't seem very interesting until the end of his character trailer, where X is seen drinking a soda with the color scheme of purple, pink, and blue. It's very possible X works at a place that, at least in some way, helps advertise for sodas. Worth noting that this way of advertisement is almost identical to the way the soda from To Be Heroine was advertised.

Conclusion: How did X get his powers?

Just like the antagonist from To Be Heroine, X was able to brainwash people with the soda (most likely via advertisement) that a man with white hair and sunglasses was omnipotent and was Hero X. Since he was the one dressing up as this, all the people believing this would inadvertently give him power.

Possible Argument: Why was X advertising an X soda if he didn't have power yet? X wouldn't have existed yet

Response: As we can see from the character trailer for The Johnnie's, Hero X had been a concept in this world long before the current X. The previous X was The Johnnie's father, so it makes sense why people would advertise for X before the current one existed.  ",5,1747361888.0,ToBeHero_X,0,1.0,False

1knpsaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1knpsaw/county_fence_biannual_magazine_part_9_the_twins/,"[County Fence Bi-Annual Magazine] Part 9 - The Twins - By Rachael Boardman, Travel Editor","Please Note: this article was originally published in print during the Biden administration. Since then things have changed.

Last week I began to feel it: the urge to step out into the street and knock people’s hats off. It may not be my cue to go see the watery part of the world, I don’t know much about that, but it is my cue to explore a little. I had three goals: no more than six hours of driving, no big (read: expensive) cities, and something different than my current context. Burlington Vermont checked nearly each of those boxes.

The box it didn’t quite check was being different from Brownlow. These cities are like twin brothers who went in entirely different directions in life. Rather than taking some easy time away I feel like I went on a fling with my boyfriend’s brother — and I’m not sure I’m sorry. I’ve seen how it could’ve been and I want it.

The nearest major city to Burlington is Montreal and it shows. The twins may have a lumber jack for a father but their mother is a French-Canadian artist. The name Vermont itself comes from the French: vert mont or green mountains, hence the green mountain state. And while it gets things done in a very American way (local, individual, rural) it thinks like a Canadian. Bernie Sanders isn’t a radical, Vermont’s just in the wrong country — maybe.

I have a thing for American college towns, Canada can’t seem to get them right. Sure we have some good ones but where’s our Burlington? Am I just comparing our college towns to the best or do we simply like our students quiet and centrally located? Even our best college towns are lacking that self-assured eccentricity that comes from intelligent people gathering in places where there’s enough enchanting space for everyone.

For example, my favourite coffee shop of all time is Cafe Mokka in Arcata, California, home to a University of California campus. It’s the sort of organic building you only get when hippies lovingly build it themselves in regions with lax building codes. Inside it sells artisanal coffee and baked goods while a model train chugs around the ceiling in a dignified and self-assured kind of way. Out back there is a yard with wood-fired hot tubs and Finnish saunas, and cafe tables arranged around a central pond. The best thing is that it’s not expensive: if I were a student in Arcata I’d be there weekly. Perhaps it’s not everyone’s cup of tea but this is where it found enough of an audience to be its best self. Where could a place like that exist in Canada?

Burlington’s foundation is very similar to Brownlow: both British colonial towns on similar waterfronts chosen for their proximity to standing lumber. Both grew to about the same population. Burlington has the distinct advantage of being the state capital and home to University of Vermont, a so-called ‘public-ivy,’ which seems appropriate. Both cities wear flannel shirts to dinner and like their outdoor activities but in Burlington it’s simply because they like it rather than some esoteric nod to tradition and frugality masking generational trauma. Here in Brownlow we can’t have the neighbours thinking we think we’re better than they are, after all.

The most compelling thing about Burlington is that the events page in the local alternative paper bursts at the seams. Even in the middle of a rainy week after exams yet before the leaves had sprouted I was spoilt for choice. There were at least twenty musical acts playing that night, weekly local bands sure but in Burlington that’s saying something. In addition to the music, local art was exhibited everywhere and there were more than a few open mic, comedy, or other creative performing arts events. None of it was particularly expensive and the place was full of small relatively affordable venues apparently making ends meet. The businesspeople of Burlington certainly aren’t afraid to ask for what they’re worth but there is always a way those more financially challenged can take part in the same fun.

The unlikely highlight of my trip was The Soda Plant. It’s strange for a shared office space to be a vacation highlight but it awoke a desire in me I hadn’t realized had been laying dormant for some time.

Venetian Ginger Ale and its sister products —temperance drinks that could be enjoyed with some Canadian Whisky likely smuggled from right here in Brownlow — was a family soda company popular in New England until it was bought-out in the eighties. Today the old bottling plant has been turned into a small-business incubator space that houses the coffee roaster I went to visit, a range of small businesses and art studios, and even a reboot of the old Venetian Soda company itself. The hallways are lined with big windows where you can watch artisans work on the product you very well might purchase and evidence of collaborations between businesses abound. In the hallway by the door was a little take-a-piece/leave-a-piece art library full of weird and wonderful odd little things, mostly drawings from the soda lounge.

The lounge itself was a fascinating space full of eclectic antiques and homemade audio equipment serving a modest but nicely appointed oft-used stage. It opened into Brio Coffeeworks which itself was located inside the roastery warehouse. So I enjoyed a fantastic cup of coffee from an antique velvet Queen Anne sofa while examining some bizarrely wonderful equipment as a crew in the background roasted coffee. Elsewhere architects designed buildings, picklers pickled, an artist or two painted, and vintage lamps were sold in a giant collection curated by a brass repairer. It was almost a neighbourhood unto itself with over twenty businesses, mostly creative, and the synergy was obvious.

Shared artist spaces, markets, and startup incubators make me surprisingly happy. I first experienced the concept over a decade ago at Tamarac Marketplace in West Virginia. This was a public project run by the West Virginia Parkways, Economic Development and Tourism Authority to build a cottage industry in a state ravaged by the environmental and social impact of coal mining. Rather than hunting down individual artisans, likely located at the end of some labyrinthine system of backroads, the state government created a one-stop-shop. Imagine an OnRoute turned shopping mall that sells only products made within the state with eight studios for artisans in residence. In 2008 Tamarac contributed $18.6 million to the state’s economy, supported 236 full-time equivalent jobs, and generated $750,000 in state and local taxes. The transit authority puts more money in than they get out but very few seem to mind the investment as it returns dividends elsewhere. It’s an idea I can get behind and an environment I’d love to be part of.

Naturally I’ve wondered what impact such a project might have in my home town of Brownlow, a community so often hurt by the fickle needs of businesses too big to care about it. Like West Virginia the GBA, or Greater Brownlow Area, could use a healthy cottage industry to balance out the ebbs and flows that come with a manufacturing based economy. It should be a place of innovation and creativity but it seems stuck on the way things have always been, a way that may have never worked but certainly doesn’t these days. Jules tells me that this is all Brownlow knows since it was built using Scots-Irish economic refugees, an unpopular group at the time, to occupy land the Americans or indigenous people might otherwise occupy and strip it of natural resources. Yet I fear we love what we know too much to support something like this.

Burlington is the kind of city that pedestrianized it’s main street so long ago it needs to be redone, yet the feeling of a well-worn and well-loved cooky idea just adds to the authenticity. Burlington isn’t trying to be cool, they are cool. Even if they had to fake to make it initially, that’s now fifty years ago and they have made it. Perhaps the difference is the university or being the state capitol, and they certainly are major differences. Yet it seems more vibrant than even larger cities north of the border so perhaps it’s American individuality and entrepreneurial spirit combined with isolation from the rest of the union. Whatever the reason, it’s the kind of city that almost immediately gives off the vibe of self-assured interest in whatever weird project you have going on that comes from everyone else having their own to get lost in. It’s the feeling of creative synergy versus insecure competition.

This article has gotten rather theoretical for a travel piece and so let me tell you about a few of my other favourite attractions. Dobra Tea Room is a wonderfully eccentric eastern-style hippie tea room that somehow pulls it off. You can enjoy an expansive and exotic tea menu either from comfortable bohemian cafe tables by big sunny windows or on meditation cushions and reed mats in the back while new-age music permeates the space. The Leahy Centre for Lake Champlain was chaotic and geared for children but Burlington is rightly proud of it. An aquarium for creatures native to the Champlain Basin, closely related to our Great Lakes region, was a rare treat when so many similar attractions are dedicated to the exotic. And of course the waterfront was delightful. It’s easy to forget that we have mountain ranges in the east and Lake Champlain is a sizeable lake full of eclectic islands connected to the Hudson River and St. Lawrence nestled between the peaks, a few of which were still snow-capped in late April. In addition to the Leahey Centre the waterfront is home to a coastguard base, pleasure boat slips, and the remnants of commercial water activities all connected by a path lined with rather nice porch-swings. 

The coffee scene in Burlington might be the best I’ve ever experienced. I’ve reached the point where the coffee I make at home is usually better than even the expensive pour-overs from well-regarded cafes. I struggle to spend the $5-7USD that a pour-over in Burlington costs in other markets but here it was worth every penny because it exposed new horizons. At Onyx Tonics the owner trained under a three-time world barista champion in Britain and roasts his own beans — you may be noticing a trend in Burlington. He spent half of my visit diving deep into the local coffee business with a patron seated at the bar. The other half he spent talking television with a screenwriter, obviously a regular. It was here that I learned a flavour I have been avoiding, thinking it was the taste of the filter paper, can be developed into crisp delicious pear. The only disappointment was Kestrel, well-reviewed and clearly the big game in town, where the barista unceremoniously dumped all the water into grounds too fine to drain properly. This resulted in a ten-minute wait for a bitter over-extracted six-dollar coffee.

At the end of the day, though, Burlington is about the atmosphere more than the individual entities within. Remove any number of players and something similar will spring up: the environment encourages creativity and innovation. I noticed this as early as the highway approaching town where the drivers combined Montreal precision with a non-competitive laid back attitude. I even found the men more attractive since the sharp edges so many seem fond of honing these days had been lovingly and indulgently filed smooth. Nobody had anything to prove, they were just being themselves and letting things happen.

I was shaken out of the nearly dream-like state that all the locals seem to drift around in when I stopped at the Brownlow LCBO on the way home. As soon as I’d entered the store a muscled and tattooed security guard accosted me with a curt “may I help you, ma’am?” and proceeded to follow me through the store despite my polite declination. Admittedly I’d more or less rolled out of bed and into the driver’s seat that morning, as is one of the perks of #vanlife. And I know that Brownlow is dealing with a homelessness and opioid crisis it is singularly unequipped to deal with. Truth be told I can’t know what was going through that security guard’s mind, nor know how many of our fair city’s homeless can afford Lululemon athleisurewear. In any case, the message felt clear: welcome home.

1knpry5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1knpry5/toxic_in_laws_and_a_conflicted_marriage_postnikkah/,Toxic in- laws and a conflicted marriage post-nikkah,"I got my nikkah done a few months ago, and my ruksati and walima are coming up soon. I wanted to share some things I’ve been going through because I honestly don’t know how to process all of it.

My in-laws are… something else. I’ve never experienced anything like this. They’ve disrespected me and my family on several occasions—most notably, they left our nikkah early without even saying goodbye to my parents. My husband didn’t speak to them for months afterward since they didn’t congratulate him and showed up underdressed, but I encouraged him to reconnect. I thought it would be better to have family ties, but I was so wrong.

Since then, I’ve been to their house multiple times, and they never offer me anything, never greet me warmly, and barely acknowledge me. It’s like I’m invisible.

My husband also has a soft spot for his sister. I understand sibling bonds, but it’s getting excessive. She calls him every single day, asks if he’s alone, and only wants to talk if he is. She shares everything with him but acts like I don’t exist. I find it disrespectful. My husband said she’s just secretive and that’s not disrespectful. 

To make it worse, when he recently got into a car accident, his sister, whom he practically adores didn’t even bother checking in on him. She was traveling and out of town, and instead of asking how he was doing, she was busy defending herself how she was sick lol. She later apologized. After two days of no contact, he spoke to her again, and honestly, that really upset me. After everything she’s done, not just to me but to both of us I couldn’t believe he still chose to engage with her like nothing happened. 

As for my husband, he says he stands up for me, but his actions don’t show that. Here are just a few things I’ve experienced:
	•	He blew up at me during a rough time when I was struggling with school and his family issues. Ngl I was blowing up on him too 
	•	He left me stranded twice, once alone without my phone (he had it by accident), and once with my sister, and we had to search for him with no way to reach him.
	•	He never confronted his sister even though she treats me like I’m a stranger.
	•	He never stood up for me in front of his parents.
	•	He hasn’t been supportive about my schooling, making comments like “What’s your plan?” and acting like he’s responsible for my student loans when I’ve never asked him to be. I take full responsibility of them. 
	•	On Eid, after I left my own family to celebrate with his since he really wanted that, he hugged his sister first like what?? His family didn’t even say Eid Mubarak to me or acknowledge me.
	•	He’s made me cry multiple times because I haven’t felt emotionally supported.
	•	He only recently started holding his family accountable after I cried and broke down.
	•	It took him 4 months to give me my mehr, and I had to keep reminding him, which felt humiliating.
	•	He procrastinates on nearly everything I ask.
	•	He accused me of lying about when I stopped eating non-zabiha meat (which I no longer eat) even though I told him. 

I’m not saying he hasn’t done anything for me. He has:
	•	Treated me to spa days
	•	Brought me my favorite coffee or made me food
	•	Treated my family kindly
	•	Given me words of affirmation

But those things don’t erase the pain of feeling unsupported and constantly disrespected.

Back to the accident so my entire family drove an hour to see him, even though we knew his parents would be there and they’ve always been cold toward us. My dad and I went first since my mom and sister weren’t home. His dad didn’t even acknowledge us, and when I greeted his mom, she didn’t return my salam. When I asked how she was doing, she replied with “not good.”

Later, when we went to his house, his entire family got up and walked inside while my husband and I stood outside. He told me to come in, but I said I’d wait for my dad since I’m not going to walk into a house where I’m clearly unwanted. My husband was already upset with his parents because they didn’t show concern after his accident. He ended up yelling at them, and his mom turned around and blamed me, saying I was “instigating” him. Then his dad cursed at her and made a derogatory comment about all women while I was right there. He even said he’d shoot both my husband and me. He looked me straight in the eye when he said it.

At this point, I just feel so overwhelmed, disrespected. I’m trying to keep things together, but it’s hard when it feels like I’m the only one fighting for peace, respect, and stability.

If anyone’s been through something similar or has advice, I’d genuinely appreciate it. My ruksati and Walima are soon and I am not sure what to do 😭

Do as much as you can the night before so your morning is as smooth as possible. 

Some examples that I do:

- Pick out my clothes the night before work.
- Rinse out my coffee mug and prep my work bag
- have a lunch and breakfast plan (I keep meals at work to save money)
- Pack the diaper bag with all the fixings
- Defrost a new milk pack in the freezer and get a bottle ready 

Bring a dad is all about efficiency. Take care of as much stuff you can the night before so that your morning is smooth and relatively stress free. Any other helpful ideas?

1knpq0t,https://i.redd.it/8la4x56my11f1.jpeg,I had an experience I can’t explain,"Ftr, I’m a rationalist, atheist. I don’t believe in the paranormal, spirits, ghosts, etc. i am however open-minded and willing always to be proved wrong. I require evidence. I gathered a data point myself today. 

I was visiting a farm in Connecticut north of Mystic, (yeah I know) that dates to the 1730’s for the original buildings. My wife was interviewing the owners for a story, our friend  was photographing for the article in the upcoming magazine. I’ve also photographed for these articles in the past but this time I was just tagging along, taking my own pics for fun. We toured the farm yesterday and slept overnight in their guest house, a converted barn and hay loft. 

We woke up, made coffee, had pancakes. I was sitting downstairs on the first floor where there’s an entry, kitchen, breakfast nook, livingroom, bathrooom and stairs to the loft with 2 bedrooms. I was sitting at the breakfast table with our friend who just came in from taking a few more photos of the animals. She and I were talking about gear, and workflow- software etc. We were talking for a good 10 minutes. It was quiet. I thought I heard my wife walk upstairs a few minutes earlier. 

As our photog friend and I were talking shop, a sound broke the silence. It was water. At first I thought my wife was running water upstairs but I remembered there’s no water upstairs, no bathroom. I got up walked toward the bathroom which was 15’ away, out of sight from where I was sitting, maybe visible to my friend but her back was to it  it’s just around the corner of the kitchen wall and the bathroom sink faucet was running full bore. I yelled to my wife, and asked if she was just downstairs and left the water running. She yelled down, “No!”. I looked at my friend at the table and said “the bathroom sink faucet is running”. She stared at me, mouth agape like wtf. I left it on for a minute and just walked around the room looking for any possible way, and reason the faucet could come on, wondering if it was on the whole time but I didn’t hear it. There was no reason. It wasn’t on before. My friend confirmed it was quiet just before we heard the water. I walked into the bathroom, rotated the cold faucet handle counter clockwise and shut it off. It was completely wide open. 

An hour later or so we met up with the owner for some more photos and I said to her, “ we had an experience in the guest house.” I wanted to leave it open ended and not tell her anything about what happened specifically in order to see if she said, “did the bathroom faucet turn on”? Instead she said, “does it involve running?” I said “in a way…” I thought maybe she was talking about running water but no, she said when they first bought the farm about 5 years ago, they- her and her family- heard the sound of running footsteps in that building. I told her what we experienced and she wasn’t surprised. She said other guests have heard the running footsteps. But they never had the water turn on. 

This area is all revolutionary war era historical. There’s an old cemetery down the road. She said she drove there once and heard murmuring, mumbling voices she couldn’t quite make out. She double checked that the car and radio was off which it was. She said it sounded like 6-8 people talking. There was no other sights or sounds or feelings associated with our bathroom event. The faucet is an old style but all new equipment. There are two separate faucet valves for hot and cold. You have to deliberately grasp it and turn it to turn it on, not like a single handle that-maybe- a falling towel could knock and turn on the water. Very very odd. I’ve never experienced anything like it and I couldn’t come up with any logical rational reason it could turn on by its self. ",11,1747361416.0,Unexplained,3,0.92,False

March 25, 1999—Thursday. 

The posh apartment suite at 465 North Park had an invitingly warm aroma. Inside, a slow-burning incense emitted a pleasant smell of fruit passion. A trail of ashes from the incense told a story of time passing. 

The sunset on the horizon displayed a pleasant orange glow that further enhanced the mood of those who occupied the high-rise apartment. 

The marble hallway that led into the bathroom had a trail mix of rose petals and Catnip–all intentionally placed. 

The door to the bathroom was cracked just enough to reveal the two occupants inside. 

A compassionate show of affection was on full display in the dimly lit bathroom. On the counter lay a gold chain, candles, empty tuna cans, and a line of Catnip. A small speaker from the ceiling provided a relaxing soundtrack that filled the room. 

The sound of running water blended in with the soft sounds of violins and an operatic voice that soothed the ears of anyone within range. 

If you listened just close enough, you could hear another sound that was like a small engine sputtering in the waters. It was neither man nor machine that occupied the marble tub full of bath bombs. 

The female companion continued singing her heart out to the one she adored. The one she bathed as a sign of respect for his love and kindness. The friend her father warned her about. 

The orange four-legged menace everyone called Rocky.



II: I gotta favor to ask

March 24, 1999—Wednesday. 

A burly middle-aged man stood patiently in the elevator of 465 North Park as he made his way to the forty-fifth floor. He continuously checked his Rolex as the early morning hours ticked by.

He couldn’t help but be embarrassed by the look of desperation that reflected off the silver lining in the elevator.

As the elevator slowly stopped in place, he took a deep breath and muttered to himself. 

“She didn’t believe me when I called. Why would she believe me now?” 

This was an urgent task that he had been entrusted with a week prior when a business associate of his called in to collect a favor that was due. 

The burly man’s name is Salvatore and he knew better than to deny his old pal Frank. 

Especially after all of the trouble, Frank went through to get his daughter off the hook with certain bill collectors. 

Even though he and Frank grew up together, that didn’t excuse the fact that a favor is a favor. And what’s due must be collected eventually. 

Salvatore knocked on the door of his daughter’s apartment and calmly waited for a response. 

After another minute he continued to knock as a female voice on the other side of the door responded. “I’m comin’. I’m comin’. Hold on. Jeez.” 

The door slowly opened as a young 20-something-year-old female stood in a silk robe, yawning at the sight of her father. 

“Pops? I was just on the phone with you. What is so damn important that you insist on meeting in person? If it’s about our discussion over the phone earlier, then forget it. I won’t help you out with any of those wise guys.” 

Salvatore raised both of his hands in defense as he calmly spoke to his impatient daughter. 

“My dear Lauretta. I did not come here to insult you. And I told you already, those are business associates of mine. They mean no harm. Please. Just hear me out.” 

Lauretta glared at her father for a moment, then rolled her eyes as she reluctantly caved into his words. 

“Fine pops. Now come inside so we don’t look like a couple of yokels rambling about nonsense.” 

Inside the apartment, Lauretta started to pour herself a cup of coffee as she questioned her father. 

“So… What’s up pops? First, you wake me up at seven in the morning. Now you’re here, and it’s not even eight. I don’t care how important this little favor of yours is if it’s anything illegal.” 

Salvatore nodded in response to his daughter’s remarks. 

“Please, Lauretta. I would never put you in harm’s way. Even my associates know better than to go after you if I ever ran afoul.” 

Lauretta continued sipping on her coffee as she listened and responded to her father. 

“Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever pops. I’m already aware that you and Frank go way back. Mom told me long ago about them days you two used to make trips back and forth to Vegas. I’m not stupid.” 

Salvatore stood by the window and started to speak. 

“This is nothing like that dear. What we did back in ‘em days was just business. Frank’s a good friend of mine. So please, listen. I’m gonna tell you something that you may not be aware of. Frank is the reason your boutique shop was never put in foreclosure.” 

Lauretta slowly put her cup down at the stunning revelation. 

She angrily demanded an answer from her father. 

“Whattya mean? How? Why? This is some kinda joke right?” 

Her father calmly walked over to explain what he could to her. 

“No. I’m not kidding. Nor can I go into the details. I’m not proud of what I did… for reaching out to Frank in the first place. But listen, dear, I’m the indebted one, not you.” 

Lauretta scolded her father for bailing her out. 

“Come on pops! Don’t give me that line of crap. Your pals don’t mess around when it comes to business. And now you’re telling me that my business is essentially theirs now! Right?” 

Salvatore glanced at his Rolex yet again, growing more impatient by the minute. Still, he regretted reaching out to his last resort as a means of keeping his little girl’s shop afloat. 

He calmly looked his daughter in the eyes and spoke of the favor being requested of him. 

“Okay. Stop. Just listen… A cat, Lauretta. I need help with a freakin’ cat. Okay? I know how ridiculous this sounds. But this ain’t no ordinary cat. He’s with them.” 

Salvatore had a hard time convincing his daughter Lauretta to assist him with the favor. 

In the end, she understood how important family is. A value that she had been taught by her grandfather who migrated over from the old country.

1knponp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1knponp/i_dont_know_where_to_go_from_here/,I don’t know where to go from here.,"So I hesitate to write this but I’m not ready to talk about this with people I know. I think my marriage has ended and I don’t see a way to save it. 

For context, (partly the reason I haven’t talked much about this with anyone is they don’t understand the context) my wife is chronically ill and has experienced severe drop in her health recently. I work in a high stress field (special education evaluation) and have experienced issues with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. 

We had a major fight earlier this week one afternoon. She was upset with me after she woke up from sleeping a good bit of the day as she felt I was not paying attention or cared about her. I was working from home and was checking on her but I assumed she needed the rest and I myself was trying to wrap up the school year. I apologized for making her feel that way and for another recent time she said I made her feel that way. I have been dealing with health and stress related stomach issues and had to get sick in the bathroom. While I was trying to recover from that and see if I could have a cease fire to finish my work day she began to text me that I was leaving it at that. 

The argument escalated and was made worse as she thought from a text that I had lied about a medication I was stopping. I decided to stop an anxiety medication as I was having suicidal thoughts while on it. We were having issues so I did this based on a tamper off schedule without talking it through with her. Honestly I felt that if the conversation went bad that I wouldn’t be able to handle it so I know it was probably worse to not communicate but I was trying to stay here for her so I did it while we were not together. 

I finally disclosed to her that I felt suicidal when on the medication and she stated to immediately gather up all sharps and yelled to know where the Benadryl I planned to use was. I told her that I felt that way when I was on the medication so I was thrown off by her acting this way now. She left the knives on a coffee table in front of me and yelled at me to tell her about the Benadryl. When she was stepped away I erratically grabbed a pair of knives from the knife block but when I realized I had them I threw them onto the couch. 

Following that my wife yelled back and forth with me but she wouldn’t let me step away from the conversation. She slapped me and when I asked her why she said I needed to snap out of it. I’m not a fragile individual but this stepped over a line I never thought she would cross. I called her parents but she called the police to report I was a danger to myself. Full context I had voluntarily committed myself to a behavioral health unit when I had a severe reaction to a medication but it was during a time we weren’t doing well either. 

I didn’t disclose being slapped to the police but I had to talk my way out of being taken to the hospital. I tried to apologize and fix things before they escalated but now I’m without a home and have been torn into by my in-laws who didn’t seem to listen to a thing I said. I’m not perfect but I’ve been trying my best and really feel that I was mistreated in this case. I want to fix my marriage but I don’t want to be treated poorly while I’m giving my all. In good news, as much as I wish I did, I don’t want to kill myself so it probably was the meds. Anyways vent over. ",1,1747361290.0,GuyCry,2,1.0,False

Interests: Scenic views and scenic drives, picturesque spots, parks, gardens, quaint shops, thrift, art, cafes, local food spots, and hidden gems. Not really into bars, fancy restaurants, or historic buildings. 

Curious questions:

* Since the River Valley is dauntingly large, any specific areas worth starting to and from?
* Are there any walkable neighbourhoods/intersections that can cover a lot of ground in terms of sightseeing/window shopping?

1knphsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/whenspiceisntsonice/comments/1knphsg/partial_chapter_1/,Partial chapter 1,"Most days I felt like a robot. Doing the same tedious things day in and day out. I couldn’t complain though. Or ask for more help. So I do the best I can. Then hope for the best. Even when he tells me my dinners taste like slop but expect me to cook, clean and do all the laundry most days. He got tired of my tasteless garbage so he cooks dinner a few times a week when I work past 5. Which is nice or I get something instant to bake in the oven.

 I learned not to speak up to jack. It either starts an argument or once the argument was done he’d tell his family about our fights or my favorite he records me being upset. It’s just not worth it anymore. I’m not blameless by any means. Instead of feeding into the arguments I could’ve walked away when I realized he just wouldn’t listen to reason. I couldn’t though . In my mind it’s human decency to be considerate of other people’s emotions even if it’s something that you’ve done,  it’s basic empathy and accountability. A simple “I’m sorry I made you feel that way, what can I do to change it?” Goes a long way. I remember Jack’s mother Hattie stating he had empathy when he bought a throw blanket with “important” dates on it. I chose not to respond to that. 

.I’ve learned that my feelings don’t matter. If you’d ask me 5 years ago if my husband valued my feelings I may have told you differently. I think our downfall started when had our youngest Glenn.  Having another child can do that to you. My oldest isn’t his. He’s raised Elena like his own though. I’m thankful for that. I noticed the withdrawal from our marriage around the time when Glenn turned 2.  Change is gradual, if you had gotten into a slowly warming tub you wouldn’t notice it getting hotter till it boiled you alive. 
    
   That’s when I first discovered his wife sharing fetish. He had taken a photo of me while I was sleeping and posted my photo an online forum. My hair was concealing my face. I found it rather disturbing at that point in time and I verbalized that. Surprisingly he took it well. We went back to the same loveless marriage as before. 

People have often asked if I did try to speak up or try to save my marriage I did. So many times I did. One way or another though it was some way always my fault. When all I wanted was his time. I briefly recall during premarital counseling the minister telling us that our spouse comes first. I had often tried to emulate that on many occasions early in our marriage. I would pack jack his lunch. Bring him his coffee. Do anything and everything he ever asked of me. I was still second to everyone else. That’s not to say Jack didn’t put in effort in the beginning of our courtship. I can recall a pair of earrings. That was when he poorly agreed to do the love dare with me after I begged than he gave up felt it was just me being dramatic. When I was pregnant with Glenn and he was still on nights he’d pack the diaper bag and have breakfast ready for me. Leave little notes. It was nice. Same after he was born till he came to days. Or when I would sob watching some cheesy romance movie. I said to him “I want that.” Jack retorted “that’s just not realistic.” He realized that was wrong to say and gave a sincere apology. One of the few I recall. That’s when it all stopped. 

   More oftentimes than not we become complacent in a long term marriage or relationship and do the bare minimum without even blinking an eye. I’m telling you these things in hopes that you’ll continue to date your partner with purpose no matter how long you’re married or together. Your children are only there for a brief period but your partner is there for a lifetime and it’s up to you to nurture that and to protect that. It’s our responsibility as parents and to our children to show them what a good and healthy relationship is. It also is in your vows to forsaken all others. That doesn’t mean completely cut off the family you left for the one you made but put your family first. 

     Jack would jump many times at the drop of a hat to help his mother or brother. They were his go to. When they’d say jump, he’d say how high. I even had mentioned once that he prioritized them over his family. I once again got brushed off. In my desperation of loneliness I even confined in Hattie about our struggles and my loneliness. How he’d always be putting them first. Her response was “what he’s not allowed to spend time with his family?!” In that very moment I knew Hattie didn’t view what Jack and I made as a family. 

    I would say our courtship and marriage were relatively normal. Up until a certain point. Which was the birth of our son. Like I had mention in the early part of my story. 

      We’d met at a local pub up the road from where my parents lived. It hadn’t exactly been a whirlwind romance but it was a cute story. Older family friend of his had been his wing man. We eventually progressed from there. He had misheard and thought my name was Tanny which is comical because you don’t hear Tamsy as a formal first name.  I’ve only ever met one other person with my name and that was when I was a teenager. Anyways, back to the storytelling. 

         I think the most vivid recollection of the downfall of my former life was when Elena who had been 5 at the time and I had taken a trip over Christmas break to see my sister Magdalena overseas where she was living with her husband Bartholomew for the last 5 years.  He’d stayed home with Glenn and tended to the house and our dog Drizzle. 
 
    Elena and I had come back before new years even. That evening we had David and Renee over to play cards. It was just normal banter so I thought. I was just sharing Elena and I’s trip. I learned a valuable lesson that day. At midnight Alison, jack’s sister had sent a happy new year text to everyone. That fallowing morning I woke up to everyone in that whole thread saying nasty things about me. Unbeknownst to me sharing stories of your own to relate to others conversations is considered rude. I also didn’t know this was a trait of ADHD. One thing that I have since been working on in therapy after my diagnosis. It stung though, knowing that my suspicions were true that his family didn’t like me and never liked me. I always tried to lead by example and to be kind. Even with Alison’s drug addiction I never joined in on his family bad mouthing her. I had no room to judge because I had been struggling with alcoholism more and more everyday to cope. 

From that point on I didn’t go over there for 8 months solid. This is where the story gets good. I did send a text saying thank you for letting me know how you all feel about me. I did get a sincere apology from Renee. Then began a back and forth with Alison. On multiple occasions Alison had “ borrowed” money for her kids. When really it was feeding her drug habit. I called her out on it. I told her that she’s no longer permitted to ask for money from my family. and to get a job and to keep a job. That she was no longer permitted in my home either. Hattie was and still is to my knowledge still heavily enables Alison. Alison for obvious reasons didn’t like this. A multitude of things were said that I can’t recall verbatim. I do recall her telling me no one liked me though. Which I already had known that, silly girl. She even shown up at our family home that day. 

The mind is such a wild thing. I’m recalling all these bad memories. Yet, I can’t recall hardly any good ones. I got a real doozy for chapter two that is another toe dipper into my ex husband’s fetish so stay tuned",1,1747360688.0,whenspiceisntsonice,0,1.0,False

1. How should I efficiently finish the sides?
I love the nubs this thing is covered in, but most of the guides I’ve found online deal with finishing smooth sided slabs. I’m a fan of using finishes like Maloof on past projects, but I don’t see how it would be possible to buff that stuff off properly after applying. I feel like I’d spend an absolute eternity trying to buff out the extra oils in between the nubs.

2. I’ve systematically broken off any nubs that are even remotely weak, but some of the wood is clearly softer than other parts. That makes me think it would be a good idea to use a penetrating oil that hardens, such as tung or linseed oil.

3. There are lots of tiny bug holes on top, about 2mm in width and depth. I tried routing down further but I’m pretty sure they go all the way through and can’t be sanded away. How do you all recommend filling these little things? Epoxy? Wood filler? Leave em? I’m currently leaning toward filling some of the larger holes that go all the way through with epoxy as well.

4. Do I need to sand the nubs anymore than I already have? Spent quite a bit of time on it already and am not quite sure when to stop. I’ve removed as much bark etc as was practical.

Hi,

While researching my coffee intake I came across some research which suggests my coffee habits, drinking 5 cups of unfiltered coffee, and 2-3 cups of decal unfiltered coffee, using my automatic machine, a Jura ENA4, raises my LDL significantly.

This appears to be  is huge contributor specially as I have been otherwise been unable to reduce my LDL using diet alone and now trying based on another post trying Black Seed soil, and other non-medical supplements as am not keen on taking a statin.  

I would love some thoughts before I go say goodbye to my morning ‘vice’ and looking for a replacement filtered machine. (suggestions welcome).

My initial answer came from https://www.perplexity.ai/search/b8eac83e-e763-4e3f-b539-bbe6346924c0 ; I have passed this answer below:

Unfiltered Coffee and Cholesterol
Unfiltered coffee, including coffee made in many automatic machines (such as some Jura models), French press, espresso, and boiled coffee, can contain compounds that raise cholesterol levels. The key substances responsible are two natural oils found in coffee beans: cafestol and kahweol, which are types of diterpenes.
How Unfiltered Coffee Raises Cholesterol
	•	Cafestol and kahweol are not removed during brewing methods that do not use paper filters. These compounds stimulate the liver to produce more cholesterol, particularly LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.
	•	Paper filters absorb most of these diterpenes, so coffee made with paper filters (such as drip-filter coffee) contains negligible amounts and does not have the same cholesterol-raising effect.
	•	Metal filters (as found in French press, percolator, or some automatic machines) and brewing methods that do not use filters (like boiled coffee) allow these compounds to pass into the final cup.
Evidence from Studies
	•	Drinking several cups of unfiltered coffee daily can raise LDL cholesterol by 9–14% in some studies, with increases of about 10–16 mg/dL (0.26–0.41 mmol/L) in LDL cholesterol observed in people drinking 4–6 cups per day.
	•	A recent study of workplace coffee machines found that many produced coffee with relatively high levels of cholesterol-elevating diterpenes, especially those using metal filters or no filter at all.
	•	In contrast, paper-filtered coffee and instant coffee have very low levels of these compounds and are considered neutral regarding cholesterol.
Jura Coffee Machines
	•	Jura machines typically use a metal mesh filter or a pressure-based brewing system, similar to espresso machines. This means coffee from most Jura machines is generally unfiltered in the sense that it does not use a paper filter.
	•	Therefore, coffee from a Jura machine can contain cholesterol-raising diterpenes (cafestol and kahweol), though the exact amount may vary depending on the model and brewing method.

He doesn't see the point, and for the most part, I don't mind. We don't have sheets, just a doona and one pillow each. If I'm last out of bed, I will pull the doona up and straighten up the pillows. Also on the floor of his side of the bed is a mess of clothes and books all over the ground, but it's his side so whatever he can do what ever he wants.   
  
We just moved house and the other day we had a friend over who took a look around and I was really embarrassed when he looked in our room and saw how messy it was.   
  
Today my boyfriend was in bed on his phone and we had guests arriving and I wanted to make the bed quickly before they came in. I asked him to jump out so I could make it, he was going to have to get out of the bed anyway once they arrived. He had a go at me about making the bed. I explained to him I just wanted it made just in case they see it. He said ""who cares, what do you think they'll do if they see the bed unmade? They'll just think we're normal people who don't make the bed."" I tried to explain to him that I didn't want our guests to think we're slobs. I don't think I'm an asshole for just wanting the house to look presentable when guests arrive.   
  
My boyfriend keeps the house relatively clean, like he won't leave dirty plates around or anything actually disgusting. But when it comes to keeping the place tidy, I'm always the one to make the house look presentable when guests come. For example, he'll leave his clothes on the couch or a bunch of books, laptop, cables, hard drives, all over the coffee table. I've never asked him to clean up, I just tidy his things and pop them underneath the coffee table or put his clothes back in his cupboard. I figure that I'm the one who cares, so it's my responsibility to do it.   
  
I'm not a clean freak by any means. I'm not the type of girl to have 100 pillows on the bed. The doona doesn't even need to be tucked in, I don't care. I'm not even that tidy myself when there's just the two of us at home. But I just wanted the house looking presentable when the guests arrive. I didn't even ask him to make the bed. He had a problem with me wanting to make the bed myself and was trying to argue with me to not do it, while our guests were waiting outside at the gate to be let in.

Advice please,"I don't know if this is the right place to post, but I was let go from my first job after college a couple of weeks ago.

I was told at the end of the day that my position wasn't needed anymore because they were changing their business goals and didn't need the software I used to do my job (I worked at a law firm). They gave me a severance check and I haven't filed for unemployment yet. Probably won't because I am going to go back to working at my old job I had during college. 

The thing is, I feel like shit. I have applied for 19 jobs total in fields that are unrelated to my degree (BA in English, minor in PR) because I live in an average sized town in the Midwest. For pay, I just want to at least make somewhere in between my 2 prior jobs. I don't care what the work is. I've applied for housekeeping at hospitals, BHT for acute care, office admin for a tech company, production managers, production operator, etc. I also tried applying for jobs that I could flex my degree and resume for in the hopes that they'd at least consider an interview maybe: human resources and marketing positions.

The funny thing, the random jobs I applied for have all turned me down, even though I have a college degree. I've been told by a few that they don't want to proceed with my application/have a second interview, even though I have an impressive resume. (I was highly active during college, 2 internships, published undergraduate research project, high GPA). I have crafted each of my resumes to fit with what the employer is looking for. It hasn't helped. 

So, because I am getting rejected, I'm going back to my prior job (supervisor and barista). The coffee shop is happy to have me come back (I was respected because I treated everyone like a human) and it makes me happy that my manager is willing to hire me back in a heartbeat. 

But I feel like I've taken a step back and I feel like shit. I feel like my degree is useless because my hometown doesn't need the skills I can offer. Yet, I can't get a job I'm willing to work because I'm apparently over qualified for some jobs that only need a high school diploma. I have a degree dammit, why isn't that enough? 

I'm married so I can't relocate because my spouse makes (now) x4 more than me. We'd be dumb to move. They are also SO supportive of me going back to my old job until I find something better, but still. I feel like a waste of space and a failure. 


I think I just need some encouragement. Anyone have any advice maybe on how to navigate through all of this? ",2,1747359892.0,careeradvice,2,1.0,False
1knp8fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1knp8fw/i_was_forced_to_watch_ten_teenagers_trapped/,I was forced to watch ten teenagers trapped inside a room for a year.,"I didn’t remember anything before the white room. Just the sterile smell of bleach and the gentle hum of a fan. I awoke on ice cold floor tiles, facedown in a puddle of my own drool. I remembered my name instantly. I was Mary. I was 38 years old.

But that was it. I had no idea who I was or where I had come from. The room was stark white and clinical, with four TV screens in front of me. The screens were old, the kind from my childhood, with a built-in VCR, chunky and box-like. 

When I woke up, they were on standby, static prickling across the glass. I demanded where I was, my mouth filled with rotten tasting ick. Silence. The buzzing lights above flickered off, leaving me in the dark, disoriented and, I guess, forced to look at the four screens. 

Below them sat a small glass table with a steaming cup of coffee and a single cookie. For a while, I was too scared to move. I sat on my knees, trying to remember anything about my life. But like broken puzzle pieces, I had come apart, unraveling, left only with my name and age. Was I suffering from memory loss? 

I checked myself over, testing for a head injury. I knew exactly how to perform health checks, almost obsessively checking for concussion. That told me something. I was in the medical field, perhaps. But this felt personal somehow. 

Too personal. This felt, oh god, like I had done this before. And just like those times, revulsion crept up my throat, panic twisting in my gut. But I didn’t know why. I didn’t know why I felt sick to my stomach, why my cheeks burned, why my hands trembled.

I was used to checking for bumps and scrapes. I knew exactly where to prod my scalp, running my fingers down my skull. 

But I was fine. I tried to escape. There were two cameras on the ceiling, which meant I was being observed, and my instinct screamed at me to get the fuck out. At that point, I didn't care how. I tried the door. Locked. I screamed to be let out. 

Again, silence. Heavy, suffocating silence that was too *loud*. That captured my every breath, making me too aware of my frenzied gasps. I noticed a pile of tapes sitting on the VCR player. I crawled forward and grabbed the first one at the top of the pile. FEB 2024 was scrawled in block capitals across the label. I felt like I was in a trance, like something was compelling me. The tape felt right in my clammy hands, as if I had held it before. 

I slid it into the machine and pressed play. The screens flickered on. A room full of kids. Teenagers. They looked like college students or high school seniors, seventeen or eighteen years old. The room was identical to mine, but smaller. The same four white walls. But unlike my room, theirs was empty. No TV screens, no coffee or food. 

Just blank white walls staring back at them, and a single bucket for a toilet. 

I had no idea how long they had been inside. But when one of them, a blonde girl with a high ponytail, jumped up and began throwing herself at the walls, panic clawed up my throat. This was the start. 

The girl started screaming. Almost immediately, another girl, a brunette with tight curls, stood up, strode over to her, and slapped her across the face. I tensed, waiting for a fight to break out. 

But instead of hitting back, the blonde wrapped her arms around the brunette, sobbing into her shoulder. A moment later, they both returned to the others, sitting cross-legged on the floor. 

I counted ten of them. Five girls, five boys. They wore identical white shorts and t-shirts, blending into the walls and floor. They looked disoriented. Just like me.

They sat in a circle, wide-eyed, staring at each other like they were strangers.

No.

I moved closer, glued to the screen, watch the them back away from each other. One boy shuffled back, jumped up, and tried to run, smacking straight into the wall. They *were* strangers. I wasn’t even sure they knew their own names. My heart felt like it was lodged in my throat. Were they nearby? 

Were they in the next room? If they were in the room next to mine, then we could help each other. Already, I was slamming my fists against the door, then the walls, screaming for help. “Hello?” I shrieked, before my cry died in my throat, and I almost fucking laughed. I wasn't watching a *live* tape. 

The realization slowly settled in, like cruel  pinpricks sliding into me. I turned back to the screens, stumbling over, and grabbing the second tape. **MAR 2024**. 

Something thick and slimy filled my mouth. I placed the tape back on the pile, forcing myself to stay calm. I was an adult– and these kids, wherever they were currently, needed my help. That's what I kept fucking telling myself, but every so often, my gaze would find the screens once again, and I felt myself unraveling. 

The footage was recorded last year– and the pile of tapes were clearly documenting their captivity. Sure, they could have been rescued, I told myself. 

But if these kids were safe, I wouldn't have been kidnapped.  I was already putting the pieces together. Whoever took me wanted me to *watch* these teenagers inside this white room with no door– no escape– no food. 

Instinctively, I drank the coffee and ate the cookie. Whoever these people were, they weren't interested in hurting me. They wanted to hurt these teenagers. The coffee was lukewarm and the cookie tasted familiar, somehow. Oven baked and fresh. There was icing, but it had been scraped off. 

Something told me I wouldn't be in the room long– not long enough to get hungry or thirsty. I found myself scanning the ceiling for more cameras. There was one attached to every corner, most likely recording every angle of my face. 

My stomach twisted as I studied the monitors. Like mine, they displayed different angles of the room trapping the teens. Screen one zoomed in on the girls.

Four of them had gathered together already, with one stray boy joining them. Screens two and three focused on the boys, appearing to be already arguing. Screen four was a bird’s-eye view of all of them.

“All right, everyone listen up,” one of the boys stood. 

He looked like the leader type. Tall and athletic looking, thick brown hair and freckles. The kids didn't have names, so I renamed him *Boy #1* in my head. Boy 1’s voice was shaking, but he kept his expression stoic. I noticed he kept scratching at his arms—a nervous tic? 

“So, I’m pretty sure someone is playing some fucking sick game.” 

His head tipped back, eyes glued to the camera. Screen three zoomed right into his face, his twitching bottom lip. He was trying not to cry. “But we need to keep a clear head, okay? Does anyone remember anything about themselves?” 

He pointed to himself. “I don't know my name. I just know I'm eighteen, and I just graduated high school.” Boy 1 took a leadership role. He was reluctant, but the other kids seemed to gravitate towards him. 

They went around the room, and it became clear to me that these kids had their memories fucked with too. The blonde (I named her Girl #1) who freaked out earlier in the tape, was immediately intriguing. She didn't know her name, but she *did* tearfully exclaim, “I have a Mom, and I *know* she's looking for me.” which triggered paranoia among the group. 

The brunette (Girl #2) who slapped her, brought up the possibility of Girl #1 being “in” on their imprisonment. 

“That's ridiculous,” Boy #1 snapped. He stood up, assuming his role of leader. This room had no concept of time, or night and day. They could have been arguing for hours, and they wouldn't even know it. “Why would she *willingly* join in on whatever this is?”

“Well, this is clearly some kind of test,” Girl #2 said matter-of-factly. 

“What if she's, I don't know, the daughter of one of the researchers— or even a researcher herself!”

“I told you, I'm not in on this! I don't know anything about this!” Girl #1 shrieked, pulling her legs to her chest. 

She seemed genuinely afraid, burying her head in her knees. “Please. I just want to go home.” she screamed, and the others jumped. “I want to go home! I want my Mom!”

Girl #2 started to speak, only for Boy#1 to shoot her the mother of all death glares. 

“Don't.” He shuffled over to her. “The last thing we need is to lose trust in each other.""

Girl#2 averted her gaze, sliding away from him. “Get the fuck away from me.”

Boy #1 looked hurt. I could tell he was the weakest among the group. He made the mistake of acting like a leader– but he was doing just that. Acting. In reality, he was just a scared teenager. His bottom lip wobbled, but he shook his head, forcing a wide gritted smile. “Aye, aye, captain.”

“Aww, Freckles thinks we’re getting out of here with the power of ‘friendship’.”

Another kid, a guy with thick blonde hair and glasses, was curled into himself. I was sure he was crying, but no matter how many times the cameras tried to catch his face, he avoided it. I called him Boy #2.

“That's fucking ah-dor-able! I'll make sure to rely on *friendship* when we’re starving.”

To my surprise, Boy#1 crawled over to the guy, laying down beside him. “Go away,” Boy#2 grumbled into his arms. “I'm trying to manifest my way home.”

Boy#1 snorted. It was the first time I'd seen him smile. “And you call *me* delusional.”

The MARCH 24 tape outlined what looked like the first month of their imprisonment. I watched it; every second, every camera angle. The kids got used to their captivity, distracting themselves with games of Charades and Sleeping Lions. 

They each gave up a clothing item, so they could create a makeshift curtain for the toilet. They were given new clothes, but it was weekly, instead of daily. Glued to the tape, I barely noticed someone had replaced my coffee with a new one. 

This time, I was given a cupcake– again, with the icing scraped off. Ignoring my own circumstances, I watched the kids slowly start to unravel. Food was given to them every morning at exactly 7am. 

It was *good* food. I watched them receive trays of McDonald's breakfast, and for the first few days, and then weeks, they seemed okay. The kids started to form a plan to escape, orchestrated by #Boy 1.

Their plan was to wait until their food was delivered, and then “attack in numbers.”

However, when their breakfast *was* delivered, it was a single slice of bread. I already knew what game their kidnappers were playing. After three days of no breakfast, Boy#1 caught on. 

“They're punishing us,” he spoke up, while they were sharing half of a slice of bread. 

The portion sizes were getting smaller and smaller. Boy#1 was rationing his own, tearing pieces off and eating them in intervals. He was also hiding yesterday's water down his pants. This kid was smart. 

“We formulated a plan to escape, and the people watching us don't want that,” he said. Boy #1’s lips formed a small smile. He was planning something. “So, for *now*, we play their fucking game.”

He was right. The kids stayed mostly silent all day, and were rewarded with three cooked meals. Following Boy#1’s words, the teens stayed quiet. Boy #2 suggested they named themselves. Boy#1 wanted to be named “Clem.” because it felt “right.”

Boy #2, insisted on Ryder. 

Boy#3, who I was pretty sure was  narcoleptic, curled up in one corner was named, “Zzz.”

Boy#4, a hard faced redhead who started most arguments over food, refused to be renamed, so the others called him, “Shitface.”

Finally, Boy#5, a kid with a buzzcut, just shrugged, and called himself, “Buzz.”

""Girl #1—the blonde, who had calmed down—didn't want to be part of the naming ceremony. 

But halfway through, she squeaked, 'Sabrina! I like the name Sabrina.” 

Girl #2, the fiery brunette, immediately called her out. 

“Okay, but *why* Sabrina?” she demanded, her eyes narrowed, hands planted on hips. “So, that's your real name?”

She was ignored– and after realizing her theories weren't helping, Girl#2 sighed, and reluctantly named herself, “Scooby.”

Girl #3, a quiet kid with pigtails, shrugged. “I like Ruby?”

Girl #4, the frizzy redhead with glasses, didn't speak. So, the others gave her a name. 

Mittens. 

Girl #5, who had come up with the naming ceremony, smiled widely. 

She pinned her dark curls into a knotted bun. I had never seen an 18-year-old wear butterfly hair slides. “Brianna!”

The tape ended on her wide smiling face, the screen flickering off. I didn't have any concept of time in that room. But I had a feeling the tape had lasted around 2 hours. 

Two hours per tape, and three coffee refills I never saw. While I had been watching, another two cupcakes were balanced on a plate. I checked them. The icing had once again been scraped off. 

For a moment, I was paralyzed, coffee-bile sliding back up my throat. “Who *are* you?” I asked the people watching me. 

When I was met with no response, I kept my voice calm. “What are you doing to these children?”

I had so many questions. 

*Why was I being made to watch these tapes?*

*Why VCR in 2025?* 

*Were these kids alive or dead– and did I even want to know?*

When my cry bounced back at me, reverberating around the room, I felt myself snap. I screamed, but it felt like screaming into a vacuum, my own cry sounding wrong, foreign, not even mine. 

I was trembling, my chest aching, my throat on fire. I didn't want to watch it. I couldn't. But already, I was crawling over to the pile of tapes, choosing **APRIL 24.**

Whatever happened to these kids, I couldn't stop it. But every time that fucking tape slipped from my fingers, I dropped to my knees and grabbed it, running my fingers over the surface. It felt personal, and wrong, and yet *right* in my hands. 

The scratchy label, and the smooth plastic of the tape. I rolled it around between my hands, my gaze glued to each screen. 

I wish I never watched them. I wish I never knew their names. But I had to *know* what happened to them. 

I had to know what twelve months of captivity did to these kids. Feeling sick to my stomach, I slid in APRIL 24.

The screen flashed blue, before flickering to life on a still shot of Boy#1 (Clem) with his ear pressed to the door. The others were gathered around, sitting in a semicircle. I had missed several days.

The kids looked worn out and tired, their clothes filthy and torn up. There was a giant crayonned rainbow on the far wall. 

Mittens (Girl#4) was playing with a green crayon, sticking it in her mouth like a cigarette. I guessed they were given them. 

""It's here!"" Clem stumbled back, and my gaze found him once again—his eyes wide. His cry caused a commotion among the others, and realization slammed into me. 

They were starving again. Clem’s eyes were hollow, his cheeks sunken and significantly pale. There was a certain twitch in his lips I was trying to ignore. He had torn off the bottoms of his pants, wrapping them around his head. 

I had no idea how long they had been without food, but the way they moved, almost feral, backing away from the door like startled deer, gave me an idea. It looked like days. ""Everyone, get *back*!"" he snarled, and to my surprise, the others slowly retracted.

Clem really was a leader, glaring down the others until they stepped back. 

Scooby (Girl #2) squeaked in delight when the food was delivered through a slot in the door. Six bags of steaming Five Guys.

But the delivery wasn't finished. When they were all tearing into their meals, something else was slid through. I barely even noticed it myself. I was too busy watching Clem eating like an animal, stuffing fries down his throat. He was going to *choke*. I felt uncomfortable, my hands shaking, like I could reach through the screen and snatch his burger off of him. 

The boy was ravenous. I didn't understand *why* I felt physical pain in my chest. I had only known these kids for a few hours, and already, I was attached to them. 

I snapped out of it when the second delivery hit the ground, startling the kids. It hit the sterile white floor tiles with a BANG. 

A pick-axe. 

I felt the phantom legs of a spider entwine around my spine. Clem dropped his burger, and stood slowly. “Don't go near it!” Girl#1 (Sabrina) shrieked. 

Clem didn’t listen to her, and something twisted in my gut. He picked it up, the thing weighty in his hands, then hurled it at the wall.“Fuck you,” Clem spat, his gaze flicking to camera three.

I felt a visceral reaction running through me, shuffling back on my knees. Then, unexpectedly, he broke into a manic grin.

“We’re not *that* crazy yet.”

With a mocking bow, he returned to his meal, and the others fell in stride with him. Nobody mentioned the pick-axe, and each kid seemed relatively adjusted. They played games, drawing on the walls, resorting back to *children*. 

I noticed Shitface (Boy#4) inching towards the axe, but he just laughed when Clem backed him into a corner. Shitface shoved him back, maintaining a wide grin. “Relax, Freckles. I'm joking around.”

The girls, however, who had formed a tight-knit group, kept their distance. When the next day came around, I think they were expecting no breakfast. And they were right. “It's okay,” Clem reassured them. “We ate yesterday. We should be okay for a while.”

Sabrina nodded, perched in Scooby’s lap. “He's right! They'll feed us eventually.”

They were *wrong*. 

Three days passed with no food and limited water (I think they were drinking from the toilet) and fights were starting to break out. Clem was sharing what he'd managed to scavenge, but I could see it in their faces. 

They were starting to lose their balance, growing delirious. Sometimes, their wandering gazes found the pick-axe still lying on the floor. They looked away, quickly, but it was clear these kids were starting to get desperate. The lights flickered off, plunging them into darkness. 

I could still see them through what looked like night vision, but the kids were blind. 

They gathered together in one corner, led by Clem. “It's okay.” he kept telling them, his voice shuddering. “We can get through this.”

Another day without food or light, the majority of them too hungry to move, and Shitface (Boy#4  finally snapped. “They're not going to feed us,” he announced, slowly getting to his feet, swaying off balance. He stumbled, and alarm bells started ringing in my head. 

“Unless we *use* it.”

Clem stood, but Boy#2 (Ryder), the sandy haired kid, yanked him back down. “He's doing it on purpose, bro,” Ryder muttered, his eyes half-lidded. He was the peacemaker. “Dude just wants fucking attention.”

To my surprise, Boy#3 (Zzz) and Boy#5 (Buzz) also got to their feet. Shit Face crawled over to the axe, blindly grabbing for it. “We’re all hungry,” he announced, smacking the blade into his hand. 

His eyes were crazed, almost feral, lips pulled back in a bloodthirsty grin. Shit Face held up the axe. “Soooo, I propose, instead of sitting around singing kumbaya waiting to fucking starve to death, we choose someone for the chop.”

The others screamed, immediately on their feet. The way they responded reminded me of animals in a pack. They couldn't *see*, but I think they could sense each other, and that was enough. With a sharp jerk of his head, Clem motioned the others behind him. 

Clem, Ryder, and Sabrina started forwards, uncertain, in the pitch dark. But this was already a mistake, and they *knew* that. 

Scooby and Mittens dragged them back, with help from Brianna. Shitface swung the axe playfully. “I'm just saying! We got actual food when we did what they wanted.” 

He started toward the others in slow, teasing strides. “I nominate Freckles. He is our leader, after all, and what leader wouldn't sacrifice himself?”

The boy’s lips curved into a smirk. “For the *greater good*, dude.”

The lights suddenly flickered on, surprising the group. Clem’s side backed away, blinking rapidly, some of them hissing. 

While Shitface stayed nonchalant, swinging the axe. They saw it as a mercy, some of the girls breaking down in relief, far off in the corner. I saw Shitface’s smile grow, his eyes widening. *He* saw it like invisible gods were confirming his belief. 

“They gave us *light* back!” he yelled, and through that stone-cold demeanor and wild eyes, I glimpsed a scared teenage boy. 

He was terrified, so he was acting out. 

""They want something back, after what they've given us,"" he announced, slipping effortlessly into the leadership role. ""They've fed us. Now they want payment.""

He was playing with their heads to get them to agree. Shitface was smart. Smarter than he let on. He was hungry, I understood that. He was fucking scared. 

But resorting to *murder*? 

The boy was in front of Clem in three strides, Zzz and Buzz following. Shitface’s smile was spiteful. He’d been itching to take the lead. I could tell by the way he moved, that cocky saunter in his step. 

“You want us all to be okay, right?” he murmured, inclining his head mockingly. 

“You want everything to be fucking sunshine and rainbows. So why not take one for the team, o’ fearless leader?”

He dropped to his knees, dramatizing a cry. “Please! Oh, *leader*, must you let us suffer? We are your *followers*, after all!”

Clem didn't move. Sabrina stood behind him, pressing her face into his shoulder. 

“Ignore him,” she murmured. “Just get back.”

Clem gently shook her away with a defeated sigh. “Okay, fine, you're right,” he told Shitface. “Give me the axe.”

Shitface’s expression crumpled with confusion. He lurched back, but Clem snatched the axe, twisted around, and hacked off Sabrina’s head with a single, brutal chop to the back of her neck. 

I think I tried to stop the tape, but I was frozen, watching pooling scarlet seeping across white tiles. The others erupted into screams, and Sabrina’s body landed at Clem’s feet. He didn't move, his fingers tightening around the wooden handle, beads of red dripping down his face and splattering his white tee. 

Shitface staggered back, his eyes wide, mouth open. Clem, unsteady on his feet, pivoted to face the others cowering in the corner. He was eerily calm, his gaze unblinking. I think I had just watched this boy lose his humanity. 

His eyes were vacant, empty pools, a flicker of a triumphant smile twitching on his lips. The hollowness of his expression stood out, terrifying and void, and I wondered if I was seeing everything. 

The tapes had been strategically recorded. I had no doubt there was missing footage.

""If they don't feed us, then we will feed them.""

I felt like I was going to puke. 

Boy#1. 

Clem. 

I found myself moving closer to the screen, until I could feel static prickling my face. He was still a kid. I didn't understand *why* I was crying. I couldn't stop, my hands were trembling, my heart pounding through my chest. He was eighteen. Just graduated. 

I fell back when he swung the axe one more time, his gaze locked onto the camera, before placing it back on the floor. 

Ignoring Sabrina’s body, Clem turned his attention to Shitface. “Don't *fuck* with me,” he murmured. Before he  dragged himself to a corner, dropped to his knees, and curled into a ball.

Scooby did her best to cover Sabrina’s body. Mittens helped her. Brianna sat in a corner, head buried in her knees.

Breakfast came the next morning. Nine individual trays filled with croissants, cupcakes, toast, cereal and chocolate. The others stuffed their faces. But I wasn't watching them. I was watching Clem.

Who, instead of joining them for breakfast, was crawling towards Sabrina’s body at a snail's pace. When he reached her, I expected him to say a prayer, or hug her. 

Instead, Clem soaked his hands in her  blood, and shuffled over to the wall. He used her blood like paint, while the wall was his canvas, head inclined, lazily dragging his fingers, scrawling a simple: “:)”. 

The other kids’ expressions were clear on each screen. They were terrified of him. Mittens and Brianna were silently eating while Scooby and Shitface stayed away, hiding in individual corners of the room. 

Ryder was the only one trying to make conversation, picking at his chocolate croissant. But even his gaze was frantic, flicking back and forth between Clem and the blood-stained axe abandoned in the corner. 

When a loaded gun was dropped through the delivery slot in the door this time, all eyes turned to Clem, still hovering over Sabrina’s body. It looked like he was trying to push her brains back inside her skull. 

Mittens surprised me by shuffling over to the gun and sticking it down her shirt. She nodded to the others and, to my confusion, they seemed to go along with it. Ryder dropped a plate of food in front of Clem.

“Eat, dude.” He pulled a face. “What the fuck are you doing?”

“Didn't we get another weapon this morning?” Clem asked, sitting up with a sigh.

Something acidic filled my mouth. He was smearing her blood all over his face. Ryder didn't reply, and the teenager turned to the others. “I said, did we get another fucking *weapon*?”

“Nope.” Shitface spoke up from his corner. “No need for frontal lobotomies today, oh fearless leader.”

Clem slowly inclined his head, and the lights flickered off once again. These kidnappers were clever. They were using the lights as a form of communication. 

“No.”

I was already choking on my words when Mittens dropped the gun with a squeak. Before I knew what I was doing, I slammed my fists into the wall. “Stop!” I shrieked, my mouth full of bile. 

“What was *that*?”

Clem’s voice sent my heart into my throat. Onscreen, his gaze was on the camera. Directly at me. There was no way he could hear me. This was pre-recorded footage from a year ago. And yet… 

“What was *what*?” Ryder murmured with a nervous laugh. “Can you hear somethin’?”

I threw myself into the walls, screaming. They could *hear* me. But that was impossible. ""That."" Clem staggered to the wall, pressing his ear against its sterile white. 

His eyes narrowed, his lip curling. ""It's a woman.""

With the group’s attention on the cameras, I grabbed the coffee cup, hurling it against the wall. “Hello?!” I yelled. “It's okay! I'm going to get you out of there!”

The tape stopped with nine pairs of eyes trained on camera four. I felt myself hit the ground, my head spinning. There was no way they could hear me. No way. 

I slid back over to the tapes, kneeling in freezing cold coffee. Feeling suffocated, I shoved the MAY 24 tape into the player. 

Blank. 

The screen was white. It was playing, but there was no *footage*. Panic started to slither down my spine, contorting in my gut. I ejected the tape, and slid in JUNE 24.

Blank. 

The screen this time was bright blue reflecting in my face. By now, I was scrambling, grabbing JULY 24.

They were all blank. Empty. I went through AUGUST 24 and SEPTEMBER 24. I think at this point, it was starting to hit me. Was APRIL 24 *live*? I left the screens, this time pounding on the door. 

“Hello?” I cried, punching the wall until my fists were bleeding. “Can anyone hear me?”

When *my* lights went out, the screens flashed from bright blue to a single still image. Clem. His face was projected on all four screens, his wide, grinning mouth, his hollow eyes. Behind him, the walls had been smeared scarlet, entrails dripping from the ceiling. 

I could see bodies behind him, but I couldn't make them out. He inclined his head slowly, a mockery of a bow, as blood seeped down his chin, stringy red tangled in his hair. And atop his head sat a crown of *something*, stark and jagged, glittering in the dim white light.

I tried six months worth of tapes, all the way to March 25. But every single one was just Clem *grinning* at the camera.

Sometimes, he would paw at it like an animal, fleshy red clinging to his teeth. DECEMBER 24 was more lively. He skipped around the room, slipping in blood, giggling, for almost six hours straight, before going back to the camera. 

Back to *me*. When I ejected the last tape, the door clicked open. I reached for the tapes, but a voice startled me. 

“Leave them, Mary.”

I did, slowly walking out of the room. 

I was on a long white corridor, and drinking in each door, those kids could have been behind one of them. Before I could check them out, a fire door was opened, and I was ushered outside where a car was waiting. I got inside with no question, and the car drove me… home. 

Home. I suddenly recognized my home town. The high school. The Kindergarten. 

The soccer field. 

When the car stopped at the end of my road, I almost toppled out, my memories slamming into me like waves of ice water. I ran home to my husband, who was standing on the doorstep, his lips pursed.

He was pale, his hands full of *paper*. 

Harry. 

He hugged me, wrapping his arms around me. “You didn't find him,” he whispered into my shoulder. 

I pulled away, my throat on fire. “Him?”

I jumped when a golden retriever jumped up at me. 

Clem. 

I ruffled his head, tears stinging my eyes. He was such a good boy. Harry led me back inside our house, into our kitchen filled with cookies and cupcakes with, “HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOY?” perfectly written with blue icing. 

And littering our house, posters with a familiar face. I snatched one up, and immediately puked. 

Zach. 

The smiling boy on the cupcakes and cookies, on the *missing* posters.

I knew how to look for bumps and scrapes because I was *used* to them. I was used to checking for concussion when my baby was knocked over on the football field. 

I wasn't in the medical field. I wasn't a doctor. I was a *Mom*. 

I didn't know I was screaming until Harry wrapped me into a hug. “Honey, what's wrong?” he kept saying, but I was numb. 

I climbed the stairs with shaky legs and stumbled into my son’s room. 

*Zach.*

Memories swamped me, dragging me to all fours. I remembered his tenth birthday party, his mouth full of frosting. 

*”Look, Mommy!” 

His voice is in my head. I can still see his face. Zach, my sweet boy. How did I forget him? How did they MAKE me forget him? 

#Boy 1.

Clem, the emotionless killer who murdered a room full of teenagers. 

My son. 

… 

Please help me. I need help. I found my son but I lost him again. I don't even know if he's *there* anymore. I can't fucking breathe. I know it sounds crazy, but on the April tape, those kids COULD hear me. 

My son could hear me.

Advice please,"I don't know if this is the right place to post, but I was let go from my first job after college a couple of weeks ago.

I was told at the end of the day that my position wasn't needed anymore because they were changing their business goals and didn't need the software I used to do my job (I worked at a law firm). They gave me a severance check and I haven't filed for unemployment yet. Probably won't because I am going to go back to working at my old job I had during college. 

The thing is, I feel like shit. I have applied for 19 jobs total in fields that are unrelated to my degree (BA in English, minor in PR) because I live in an average sized town in the Midwest. For pay, I just want to at least make somewhere in between my 2 prior jobs. I don't care what the work is. I've applied for housekeeping at hospitals, BHT for acute care, office admin for a tech company, production managers, production operator, etc. I also tried applying for jobs that I could flex my degree and resume for in the hopes that they'd at least consider an interview maybe: human resources and marketing positions.

The funny thing, the random jobs I applied for have all turned me down, even though I have a college degree. I've been told by a few that they don't want to proceed with my application/have a second interview, even though I have an impressive resume. (I was highly active during college, 2 internships, published undergraduate research project, high GPA). I have crafted each of my resumes to fit with what the employer is looking for. It hasn't helped. 

So, because I am getting rejected, I'm going back to my prior job (supervisor and barista). The coffee shop is happy to have me come back (I was respected because I treated everyone like a human) and it makes me happy that my manager is willing to hire me back in a heartbeat. 

But I feel like I've taken a step back and I feel like shit. I feel like my degree is useless because my hometown doesn't need the skills I can offer. Yet, I can't get a job I'm willing to work because I'm apparently over qualified for some jobs that only need a high school diploma. I have a degree dammit, why isn't that enough? 

I'm married so I can't relocate because my spouse makes (now) x4 more than me. We'd be dumb to move. They are also SO supportive of me going back to my old job until I find something better, but still. I feel like a waste of space and a failure.

I basically, work whenever I am awake and whenever I am not working, I feel anxious to work. I wake up 8:30 every day, with some days 6:30 after going to sleep 2AM. But I noticed I've taken a hit in my productivity. I can't fucking look at a computer's screen and give in to the smallest of distractions, I am stressed 24/7 and my physical health has been declining. The only non-work activity I do is sex, which is only twice a week since I am not married nor dating.

I have a psychiatrist because I do have OCD, he's been successful in treating it, I noticed it decreased significatively since the beginning of the treatment. I recently talked to him about my life's balance and he said I might be experiencing a slight burnout, he asked I wanted to have medicine prescribed but I refused on health concerns.

Is there a way to cure this burnout and keep working? I have a company and there's a project I've sunken a bunch of time and effort into, competitors, although also in early stage, are starting to appear and I need to be at my max productivity currently. I usually don't drink coffee or energy drinks (the latter being on health concerns) but I took a couple of Red Bulls some months ago and it felt amazing, I was so energized for so long (although the focus was still a problem). Problem is, I don't want to drink energy drinks because of the health side effects, I can't drink coffee because the hotel I am living in had no coffee machine and in Brazil there aren't many healthy energy-consumable options like Celsius or KetoneIQ.

I've been noticing a bunch of posts lately asking **""How do I make friends in Mississauga?""** And honestly? This post *is* your answer.

I'm the organizer behind the Mississauga Reddit meetups, and after taking a little break in April, **I'm back and excited to get things rolling again!** 🙌



Details: 

🗓 **Date:** Thursday, May 29th 

📍 **Location:** The Crooked Cue, 75 Lakeshore Rd E, Mississauga, ON L5G 1C9 

🕖 **Time:** 7:00pm - 10:00pm



Since I started these meetups in January, I've had the chance to meet a *wide variety* of amazing people — and I'm not just saying that. Through these events, I now have:

* A semi-regular coffee date group 
* An active Discord full of like-minded folks to chill and game with 
* And oddly enough... someone who's now become one of my *bestest* friends 

But let me be real with you — this didn’t happen overnight. It took some effort. I had to **open up**, share my interests, and (most importantly) **make time for others**. It was worth it.

Let’s be real: 

If you’re currently meeting 0 new people on a daily basis, coming out for one night and having 15+ friendly strangers to chat with is a **huge win**. 

I totally get that coming out to something like this can feel intimidating — especially if you're shy or don’t know anyone yet. But the vibe at these meetups is super relaxed, and honestly, everyone’s there for the same reason: to meet people and make connections. You don’t have to be the most outgoing person in the room — just showing up is a great first step, and you'd be surprised how easy the convos start once you're there.

# So yeah — if you’re looking to make friends in Mississauga, this is your shot.

[Grab a ticket](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/rmississauga-meetup-tickets-1368141771869?aff=oddtdtcreator), come say hi, and see where it goes!

Come hang out, chat, laugh, meet cool people — and maybe even start building your own little community like I did.

Five months ago, I caught my boyfriend talking to another girl. I did a ""loyalty test,"" and he admitted that the girl was someone he used to talk to and matched with on a dating app. They met up for coffee about 4-5 times but never held hands or kissed. I even asked the girl directly about it, and she confirmed it.

What bothered me more was that this girl was the first person he followed on TikTok, even though he didn’t have a TikTok account back then. I checked his IG and saw that he followed her too, and when I asked him about it, he said she was just a ""relative."" But I didn’t buy it, so I kept checking.

Three months after the issue, I found out he followed random girls again. I confronted him, and he apologized and gave me access to his IG account. When I asked if he knew any of the girls, he said and other girl is just “tropa” (friends). But just last month, I found out that one of the girls he followed, whom he claimed was just ""tropa"", was actually someone he used to talk to again. He didn’t admit it at first because he didn’t want to start a fight.

Now, he assures me he’s committed and that it’s all in the past, but I’m struggling to trust him again. I’m an overthinker, and I can’t shake the fear that he might do it again. Is it normal to feel this way after everything that’s happened? How do I stop overthinking and trust him fully? Has anyone gone through something like this?",1,1747359074.0,TanongLang,8,1.0,False

Would a combo of one of these plus the Ode be a good entry into espresso? We would probably make two drinks in the AM and one in the afternoon daily. I like steamed milk and would love to try learning latte art. He’s more about function and getting the grind and creama dialed in.

1knouia,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1knouia/more_sample_reviews/,More sample reviews,"Do I maybe have a problem with buying samples instead of full size bottles? Perhaps.

Here are some of my favorites and not-so-favorites this time. Not a professional, this is mostly just vibes.

Serge Lutens - Feminite du bois 10/10 love love love this it's sweet, but not sickly sweet, woodsy, a bit unusual but in a way that I love. 

Tom Ford Noir de Noir - 9.5/10 think this is my new favorite Tom Ford. To me it smells a little boozy, and like... dark chocolate, cherries. I know those aren't the notes. It's the vibes. So good. 

Replica Coffee Break - 8.5/10 this is going to sound weird. It does not smell like coffee. It smells like gasoline to me. But I just happen to LOVE the smell of gasoline hahaha

Serge Lutens La Fille de Berlin - 7.5/10 Sweet, rosy, but with a bit of spice. Nice and I do like it, but I've smelled better rose scents. Still, the little bit of ""unusual"" is enough to make me want to smell more from them. 

MFK- 7.5/10 Oud Satin Mood it smells to me like... some kind of fruit tart. Sooooo sweet but in the right setting I'd love it. 

Nishane Hundred Silent Ways - 7/10 Sweet with a little bit of spice in a very balanced way. Good, but not really my vibe. 

Jean Paul Gartier Divine - 6.5/10 - It's a nice scent, reminds me a bit of Mugler Alien Goddess Intense. It's just not really ""me"". I can see myself wearing it in the summer, but I hate the summer 😂

Perfums de Marly Meliora - 7.5/10 Probably my favorite perfume that I can definitely wear in the heat. So again, not really my vibe, but it's a bit less sweet than JPG and Alien Goddess to my nose.

Armani Rose D'arabie - 7/10, nice but nothing to write home about. I might just be rose'd out at this point. 

And one that confuses me

Diptyque Philosykos - ??? I cant tell if I like this one or not. It is so odd to me. My gut reaction was absolutely not but there's something interesting about it.

I basically, work whenever I am awake and whenever I am not working, I feel anxious to work. I wake up 8:30 every day, with some days 6:30 after going to sleep 2AM. But I noticed I've taken a hit in my productivity. I can't fucking look at a computer's screen and give in to the smallest of distractions, I am stressed 24/7 and my physical health has been declining. The only non-work activity I do is sex, which is only twice a week since I am not married nor dating. 

I have a psychiatrist because I do have OCD, he's been successful in treating it, I noticed it decreased significatively since the beginning of the treatment. I recently talked to him about my life's balance and he said I might be experiencing a burnout, he asked I wanted to have medicine prescribed but I refused on health concerns.

Is there a way to cure this burnout and keep working? I have a company and there's a project I've sunken a bunch of time and effort into, competitors, although also in early stage, are starting to appear and I need to be at my max productivity currently. I usually don't drink coffee or energy drinks (the latter being on health concerns) but I took a couple of Red Bulls some months ago and it felt amazing, I was so energized for so long (although the focus was still a problem). Problem is, I don't want to drink energy drinks because of the health side effects, I can't drink coffee because the hotel I am living in had no coffee machine and in Brazil there aren't many healthy energy-consumable options like Celsius or KetoneIQ.

There were some large holidays in Brazil some weeks ago and I took a large pause from life. I felt so relaxed, but currently I can't do that and need to be at my max.

Ella

“I’m sorry Ella.” My physician says gently. “I’m afraid you have very few viable eggs remaining. Frankly, I normally see these numbers in women ten or fifteen years your senior.”

“What?” I murmur, not believing my ears. I’ve been trying to get pregnant for years. I’m only 30, I should have plenty of eggs left.

“In terms of fertility, you have very little time left.” She continues. “If you want to conceive, you need to do so before your next cycle begins.”

“My next cycle?” I repeat, my mouth hanging open in shock. I love kids more than anything, and though it might not be everyone’s ambition, I want nothing more than to be a mother.

I have to get home and tell my boyfriend this news, and there’s not a moment to waste.

I make it home in record time, bursting through the door and opening my mouth to call for Mike, but stopping dead in my tracks. As soon as I walk inside I see a pair of high heels and a handbag by the door – neither of which belong to me.

I cock my ears towards the bedroom, and my stomach churns when I hear the unmistakable sound of moaning, accompanied by a steady thump thump thump, as the bed collides with the wall. Worse even than realizing that Mike is clearly in there with another woman, is realizing who he’s with. I know that handbag, and I know those shoes – they belong to my best friend, Kate.

“Fuck, Ella is so stupid.” Mike laughs, “can you believe she actually expects me to have a baby with her?”

Kate snorts, “she’s delusional. I don’t know how you put up with her for so long in the first place.”

“If she wasn’t so beautiful I never would have given her the time of day.” Mike scoffs. “Thankfully daily doses of plan B kept her from ever conceiving.”

“The morning after pill?” Kate asks, “how did you manage to give it to her without her realizing?”

“I put it in her morning coffee.” Mike chortles, sounding far too proud of himself.

My vision goes completely red as everything finally falls into place. Suddenly it’s clear why I’ve never been able to get pregnant, despite having unprotected sex multiple times a week for years. It’s even clear how I could have the eggs of a 45-year-old, if my despicable partner has been secretly feeding me emergency contraceptives every day – there’s no telling what other damage that might have done to my reproductive system.

Before I can think better of it, I pull the smoke alarm on the wall, wanting to frighten and punish the pair in the bedroom so fiercely that I fear I might attack them when they emerge. Water immediately sprays down from the sprinkler system mounted to the ceiling as a shrill siren fills the air, and I hear Mike and Kate cry out in surprise.

A few moments later they come rushing out of the bedroom, stopping in their tracks when they see me looming in the doorway. Mike’s eyes go comically wide, “What are you doing home so early?” The snake has the nerve to sound affronted that I surprised him, when he’s the one who’s been sneaking around behind my back for God knows how long. He seems to realize how suspicious it looks that he and Kate are standing there in their underwear and quickly adds, “Kate came to see me so we could plan a surprise for your birthday, but then we spilled coffee all over our clothes so we had to change.”

Fire blazes in my veins, he must truly believe I’m an idiot if he expects me to buy such a feeble excuse.

It’s a testament to their horrifically low opinion of me that they buy my act, and I vow to get my revenge one way or another. I can’t believe I wasted so many years – my best years – on this scumbag. And now he may have cost me my future too. As soon as the thought enters my head, I know I can’t afford to waste another moment on Mike, I have more important things to take care of.

I make my excuses and rush across town for the second time that afternoon, running to the comforting arms of my surrogate sister, Cora. Not only did we grow up together in the orphanage, but she became an OBGYN and now works for the most exclusive sperm bank in the city. I’ve never gone to her before because I always imagined Mike and I would eventually conceive the natural way, but that clearly isn’t an option anymore.

Even if I could find a man willing to have a baby with me in time, I’m not eager to trust anyone after Mike’s betrayal. I’m going to have to do this on my own, and I know Cora can help me. I don’t have much money, but I have enough savings to pay for the insemination, especially since I basically have one shot and one shot only.

When I arrive, all my plans to lay out my situation for Cora clearly and concisely go out the window, because the moment I see my sister I fall to pieces. She hugs and kisses me until my tears subside, slowly extracting the story from me piece by piece. When she hears about Mike and Kate she swears up a storm, but that’s nothing compared to her reaction when I explain about my fertility.

“That little shit! I’ll kill him!” She fumes, studying me with a worried expression. “Ella, if your doctor was right this means you only have one chance to conceive.”

“I know.” I sniffle. “And if this is going to be my only baby, I don’t want to take any chances. I want the best donor we can find.”

“Don’t you worry about that.” Cora assures me, “We’ve got donations from actors, models, scientists – it’s only the creme de la creme here.” She glances at the door and lowers her voice. “You didn’t hear it from me, but even Dominic Sinclair sent his samples here for testing.”

“Dominic Sinclair? I repeat, “the billionaire?” I’ve seen the man around town, but we don’t exactly run in the same circles. He lives in the same neighborhood as my wealthy employer and often says hello to the children I nanny, but he’s always surrounded by bodyguards and is so intimidating I get goosebumps just thinking about him.

“Oh my god!.” Cora slaps her hand over her mouth. “I wasn’t supposed to tell you that! I don’t know what I was thinking. Apparently he’s no stranger to fertility issues himself, and he trusted us to handle his swimmers over every other lab in the country. I’ve got his sperm in the other room at this very moment.” She frets, “But Ella you can’t tell anyone, you have to promise me.”

“Of course!” I agree immediately. “I know how important confidentiality is here.”

“Thank you,” Cora breathes. “Now, I’m going to give you a dossier of our clients so you can pick a donor, and once you’ve chosen we’ll get you knocked up before you can even blink.”

It’s not an easy decision, but eventually I choose a handsome surgeon whose photo practically makes me swoon. Cora leaves the room only long enough to prepare the sample, and though she looks a bit flustered when she returns, she quickly and professionally completes the insemination, holding my hand when the procedure is finished. “It’s all take care of now, Ella.” She promises, “You can come back in ten days to see if it worked.”

Ten days. I think dazedly. Ten days to decide my entire future.

If only I’d known that by the time those ten days were up, my future would no longer belong to me – but to Dominic Sinclair himself.

# #Chapter 2 - Be Fired

Ella

Six days to go. I think, staring at the date circled on my calendar. Six days until I find out if my dreams are finally going to come true… or if I have to figure out an entirely different plan for my life.

I’ve thought about nothing else since Cora inseminated me last week, I’m so anxious to find out if I’m pregnant I haven’t even begun to process Mike’s betrayal.

I’m trying to keep a level head, yet I can’t help but imagine my future with this new baby. Try as I might, I catch myself daydreaming about it constantly. I even find myself humming as I get ready for work in the morning.

When I arrive at my employer’s estate in the most exclusive neighborhood in Moon Valley – which basically makes it the most exclusive neighborhood in the world, since Moon Valley is one of the most expensive cities on the planet – I’m immediately greeted by two little voices shouting my name in excitement. “Ella!”

The next thing I know, 3-year-old Millie is hugging my legs while her older brother, Jake, wraps his arms around my middle. “Good morning love puddles!” I exclaim, returning their hugs. “Are you ready for the museum?”

“Yeah!” They cheer, racing out the door without even stopping to put on coats. It takes a bit of wrangling to get them back inside and bundled up for the cold winter day, but before long we set out into the snow.

Jake races ahead of Millie and I, impatient to get to the science museum and not seeming to notice that his sister’s tiny legs simply don’t move that fast. Chuckling, I lift Millie into my arms and settle her on my hip. “Goodness, you’re getting too big for this, munchkin.”

“Nuh-uh,” Millie grins, “You’re justs too little.”

She might have a point. At five foot one, I don’t exactly have the kind of build suited to heavy lifting. I’m in great shape, but I’ve never been particularly strong. “Smarty pants.” I tease, laughing with the little girl.

When I look back towards Jake, I realize he’s stopped a few feet ahead of us. My heart skips a beat when I realize why. We’re in front of the Sinclair mansion, and its owner is currently standing in the middle of the sidewalk, his gaze searing me like a firebrand as I approach with Millie. Dominic Sinclair is just about the most handsome man I’ve ever seen, but he’s also one of the most terrifying.

With dark hair and piercing green eyes, chiseled features and a body so muscular I could swoon, it doesn’t seem fair he gets to look so good and also be so rich. If I didn’t know better I might think it was his wealth or imposing height that makes him so intimidating, after all he’s at least six foot four, which means he towers over me and everyone else around him. However it’s neither of those things, there’s simply an indefinable quality about the man that I can’t put my finger on, one which screams danger. He gives off this energy that’s so raw and animalistic one forgets there’s anyone else in the room.

Taking a steadying breath, I close the distance between us so Millie can say hello. When she greets him, Dominic drags his attention from me and offers her a smile so genuine that it tugs at my heartstrings. As I watch him talk to my two young charges, I remember what Cora told me about his infertility struggles. He clearly loves children, and I feel a wave of empathy for him. If anyone knows what it’s like to yearn for a family of their own, it’s me.

Jake is currently showing Dominic his new toy airplane, pulling the matchbox model from his pocket and demonstrating how far it can fly. With a great heave, he sends the toy gliding through the air, only to land in the middle of the street. Before any of us can say a word, Jake races after it, right into the busy road.

“Jake no, be careful!” I cry, watching him dart out into the path of an oncoming car but feeling frozen by my fear. Before I can contemplate putting Millie down to go after him, a blur of movement whirrs past my vision. I’ve never seen anyone move so fast in my life. Dominic became little more than a hazy outline of himself, chasing after Jake and pulling him out of the way just before the car slams into them. The vehicle’s tires are still screeching when Dominic sets Jake down beside me, his expression suddenly very stern.

“That was very dangerous.” He scolds gently. “You should never go into the street without looking both ways first.”

Jake hangs his head. “I’m sorry, I didn’t want my plane to get runned over.”

“You are a million times more important than a toy.” Dominic tells him firmly, “and you scared your nanny half to death.”

“I’m sorry, Ella.” Jake sniffles, looking up at me with wide eyes.

“I know sweetheart, just don’t ever do that again.” I breathe, cuddling him against my side. “Thank you so much.” I say to Dominic, feeling more grateful than I can express. “I have no idea how you moved so fast! It was like something out of a superhero film.”

“Must have been the adrenaline.” Dominic shrugs, giving Millie another smile before taking his leave. “Enjoy the rest of your day, and stay out of the road young man!”

“Yes sir!” Jake calls after him, pocketing his airplane. “I really am sorry.” He adds to me.

“It’s forgotten.” I tell him softly, though I take his hand so that he can’t run off again.

“It all happened so fast.” I tell Cora later that night. “I mean the more I think about it, the more amazing it seems. One moment he was there, and the next he was gone. It was like magic.”

“Thank goodness Jake is alright.” She replies, but rather than looking relieved, her face is twisted into a deep grimace.

Studying my sister’s expression, I realize her grim demeanor is not just about Jake’s near miss. Something else is wrong, and I actually feel guilty for not noticing sooner. “Is everything okay?”

Cora frowns, “Not really. But you’ve got so much going on right now, it’s not important.”

“Cora, don’t be ridiculous.” I admonish. “What’s going on?”

“Well, speaking of Dominic Sinclair,” She begins cryptically, “you know that sperm he sent to us for testing?”

“Yeah,” I confirm, wondering where on earth this was going.

“It’s gone missing… and I’m the last person who saw it, not to mention it was in my custody.” She explains, her voice becoming thick with emotion. “Ella, I think… I think I’m going to be fired. And if there’s an investigation I could lose my medical license.”

“What?” I exclaim. “What do you mean it’s missing? A vial of sperm can’t just get up and walk away.”

“I know, I think someone had to steal it, but there’s no way of knowing who’s responsible. And it looks like I’m going to have to take the blame.” She shares, her eyes shining with tears.

“Cora, I can’t believe you didn’t tell me this sooner!” I lament, “They can’t fire you, it isn’t fair.”

“You don’t understand, Dominic is one of our biggest donors.” Cora explains. “And he’s furious, he basically wants my head on a platter.”

A week ago I might have believed there was no hope for Cora, but seeing how kind and understanding Dominic was with the kids today makes me wonder if he could really be so heartless. Surely if he understood that Cora would never be so irresponsible he’d show some leniency? I have to try and help her, I would do anything for my sister – even begging a ruthless billionaire for mercy.",1,1747358363.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share where I’m at—26 days caffeine-free after being a long-term, high-dose caffeine user (started young, years of sodas, teas, energy drinks, then strong coffee daily).

And let me tell you… this has not been easy—but it's already so worth it.

What I’ve noticed so far:

My speech is smoother and more relaxed

My traps and upper back tension are melting little by little

I’m breathing deeper without trying

My anxiety is fading—it’s like my body isn’t stuck in defense mode anymore

Sleep is deeper and dreams are returning

I’m feeling more present, more grounded, more me


This journey has been incredibly isolating at times, especially when everyone around you is reaching for that next cup. But I can feel my nervous system recalibrating—and the anticipation for what's to come is keeping me going.

I know I’m still early in this (just shy of 30 days), but something deep inside says… the real healing is just beginning.

Anyone else at this stage or beyond—how did things shift around the 30, 60, 90-day marks? I'd love to hear your stories and what helped you stay the course.

Thanks for reading—sending strength to all of you walking this path. You’re not alone.

I smooth down my pencil skirt and tailored gray jacket, glancing at the hall mirror as I touch up my dark lipstick. With a resigned look, I check that my tawny hair is neatly secured in a sleek high bun. Sighing, I take a steadying breath, suppressing the gnawing anxiety in my gut.

I'll do.

I scrutinize my reflection, satisfied with the image of cool efficiency and authoritative gray tailoring I see before me. There's no hint of the emotional turmoil brewing inside. I narrow my eyes, searching for any imperfections in my impeccable armor—stray hairs, specks of dust, or creases. Nothing escapes my scrutiny.

I've never been one to love my own reflection, what with my youthful appearance, cool blue eyes, and pouting lips. But today, I look the part of a personal assistant to a high-profile boss. On the outside, I exude professionalism and capability, with every detail in place and my clothes flawlessly neat. I've always been adept at concealing my true feelings.

Slipping into my stilettos with a deliberate and careful motion, I steady myself with one hand against the wall. Catching the movement in the room behind me, I instinctively check the mirror.

""Morning, Ems. Wow, you look as professional as ever,"" Sarah stifles a yawn as she emerges from her room, rubbing her eyes with the back of her fist in a childlike manner. It's unusual for her to be up this early on her day off—mornings have never been her thing.

Dressed in a baggy pink housecoat, her short, bleached blonde hair sticking up in all directions, Sarah looks effortlessly lovable. I can't help but feel affection for that bundle of cheerful energy. Her bright blue eyes betray the weariness of the early hours, and she watches me closely, a silly smile playing on her lips. A little too closely for my liking.

""Good morning, Sarah,"" I offer a light smile, attempting to ignore her intense gaze. Straightening up, I retrieve my briefcase from the floor and stride purposefully into our open-plan apartment. Even in front of Sarah, I'm acutely aware of my grace and mannerisms, knowing I'm under scrutiny. I push down the tightness in my nerves, suppressing the restlessness in my stomach.

""Remember, you need to be here by ten o'clock for the boiler repair,"" I remind her as she shuffles along behind me towards the living room area, hoping to divert her attention from her curious staring. Mentally running through my schedule like a checklist gives me something else to focus on besides my unease today.

""I know. I know! You left a memo on the fridge, remember?"" she giggles playfully, rubbing her eyes again and giving me a patient look, arching an eyebrow with an almost indulgent expression. She looks much younger than her age, and sometimes I forget that we went to school together. These days, I feel more like her guardian than her roommate, if I'm being honest. I sigh once more, suppressing the apprehension growing inside me, and muster a small smile of bravado.

""Don't forget,"" I sound stern, but she doesn't react. She's used to my serious tone and my meticulous organization of our lives. She knows that's just the way I am—the need to be in control and have everything in order makes me feel more capable.

""I won't. I swear. I'm not working until tonight, so I'll stick around and chillax... maybe binge-watch some Netflix,"" she says nonchalantly, moving lazily through the bright white and gray kitchen to make herself a coffee. With another sleepy, bright smile, she lifts the mug I washed earlier this morning from the rack for herself. I watch her casual, confident movements around the space and her domain when she’s at home, which gives me a sense of calm.

# CHAPTER2

""I'm off to work,"" I announce, striding confidently into the small hallway adjacent to the bar area that extended into the lounge. I grab a few open letters from the counter, ones I haven't dealt with yet today. It's unusual for me to linger and act indecisively; typically, I'd already be on my way to the subway station, even though I'm early.

""Oh, here,"" Sarah says, sliding a white envelope from behind the toaster and holding it out to me expectantly. She wears a blank expression. ""Before I forget... I know you've probably taken care of them already, as usual."" Her eyes sparkle with affectionate amusement.

I take the envelope from her, examining it with a frown. It's long and devoid of any writing on the front. ""What is it?"" I ask, slowly accepting it with careful fingers.

""It's my half of the utilities and rent. I got paid early,"" she explains, her smile bright as she starts preparing her breakfast, popping slices of bread into the toaster.

""Ah, right. I've already taken care of it... thank you,"" I reply, slipping the envelope into my bag to deposit during lunch. I make a mental note to remind myself. Paying our bills at the beginning of each month is part of my routine, effortlessly managed due to my well-paying job with its perks.

""No surprises there, then,"" she mumbles, casting me an affectionate look. Cute eyes and gentle sighs accompany her sideways gaze, which I catch. I shake my head, fully aware that she prefers me to handle our living expenses. She's never been good with money, and without my organized presence, I doubt she'd remember to pay the rent on time. Taking care of things is how I prefer it—it gives me purpose, control, and the focus I need to thrive.

""I won't be home until six o'clock, Sarah. I assume you'll be at work by then. Have a wonderful day,"" I inform her, moving away from the breakfast bar and heading toward the main door of our apartment. As I pass the dining table, I pick up my warm jacket and smile when I reach the dark slate door.

""Oh, wait... good luck meeting your super-hot boss for the first time, Miss Anderson!"" she exclaims, beaming at me with excitement, raising her eyebrows and leaning out across the countertop. Her head pops out from the kitchen at a funny angle, appearing messy but cute, and far more awake than usual. I offer a hollow smile, determined not to reveal my emotions or show any signs of weakness.

""Thanks,"" I reply, feeling a slight heat rise in my face as nerves hit my stomach hard. I quickly dismiss the sensation, swallowing it down like a seasoned actress.

""Are you nervous?"" she probes, furrowing her brow and still leaning out a little too far to observe me adjusting my briefcase handle and putting on my jacket. I frown in response, feeling the tightening knot in my stomach intensify, but I shake my head to indicate 'no.' Admitting it to her would mean admitting it to myself, and that would only allow my nerves to overpower me, causing me to lose my edge.

That simply wouldn't do.

""Of course not. I never am,"" I respond. She adds quickly, ""You never are!,"" with a grin before retreating back into her culinary world, oblivious to any unease in my demeanor. I smile once more, watching her fade from view, and wave my fingertips before heading out the door on my mission to get to work.

Sarah, dear Sarah. She has such unwavering faith in my abilities and outward composure that I often wonder if she still remembers the girl I used to be when we first met all those years ago. Does she even associate me with that version of myself?

Closing the door behind me in hushed silence, I grasp the handle for a moment, inhaling deeply and allowing myself a brief moment of stillness. I refuse to let my emotions break through my armor. Gazing down at the cool silver knob, I use it as an anchor to calm my racing nerves, suppressing any anxiety or fear that threatens to creep in.

I can do this.

This is what I've tirelessly worked for. Finally, my skills and dedication are being recognized after years of toiling and climbing the corporate ladder. I must quell the inner doubts and shed the remnants of my adolescent self, focusing solely on the tasks and responsibilities that await me today. It's exhilarating yet overwhelming, but internally, I steel myself, stilling my trembling hands as I've practiced countless times over the past decade. Each day, I have strived to become the person I am now, the composed and confident persona known as Emma Anderson.

It takes a moment before I can bring myself to step away from the door. But when I do, the protective armor envelops me, and the mask seamlessly settles upon my face. With each step, my determination strengthens, returning me to my familiar, practiced demeanor. Deep within, I find the resilience and unwavering strength to navigate through this day and every day that follows. And so, I make my way to the subway station.",1,1747358256.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

It’s me again! I’m sorry, I just have so many questions. I’m trying to plan the best first trip to Quebec City. I really enjoy coffee and would love to find a really good coffee shop and I’m also looking for a really good pastry shop. One of my favorite things to do when visiting new places is try the local coffee and pastries.

1knonew,https://i.redd.it/dnkdwlu3o11f1.jpeg,Jefferson Laya-Freites,"Jefferson Laya-Freites, 33, and his cousin, Robert Elista Jimenez’s, and their two families fled Venezuela after the murder of a relative. They were worried about violence, oppression and the economy, and hoping to find somewhere they could give their children a better future. They felt the dangerous trek north to the United States through jungles and deserts would be worth it. 

After arriving in thr US, Jefferson started working at a stone countertop company, and his cousin worked at a remodeling company, their wives said, proudly showing photos and videos of them in the workplace.  

""We were doing things right,"" Jefferson’s wife said.  

A father with five kids, Jefferson has no criminal record in the United States, and his wife says he’s never been part of the [Tren de Aragua gang](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/18/what-is-tren-de-aragua/82520940007/), as Trump claimed. 

Federal immigration officials detained Jefferson and his cousin Robert on Jan. 28 near a transit station and took the men to a privately run U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility five miles from where the family lived. Both men were there for a month. 

Then, despite having work permission and a pending asylum claim, Jefferson and his cousin were transferred to Laredo, Texas. At that point, they told their wives they expected to be deported to Venezuela. Instead, they were flown to El Salvador on March 15. 

Their families only found out where they were after seeing social media video of chained detainees being hauled into the prison. 

“I get out of bed and think about him and how he’s doing,” Jefferson’s wife said. “They treat them like animals but he’s a good man. He doesn’t deserve that.” 

Now, without Jefferson’s salary from the stone countertop company where he worked, his wife is struggling to pay their mounting bills, including the rent for their one-bedroom apartment.

The dishes are piling up in the kitchen sink. 

And their five children just won’t listen to her. 

“I have to keep going for my kids,” she said, tears rolling down her face. 

""You leave your country because of so many things happening with the government, with criminals,"" Robert Elista Jimenez’s wife said. ""You're worse off here … I used to say, 'the United States, the best country in the world, the laws are followed there.'"" 

Both women asked not to be named**,** worried that speaking out might make them targets for immigration officials. 

Many of the [Venezuelan men sent to El Salvador had tattoos](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/21/tren-de-aragua-tattoos-trump-venezuela-deportation/82592900007/). Even though Jefferson didn't have any, his wife has seven – all with personal meaning and none connected to a gang, she said. Still, out of fear, she makes sure to cover them up every time she leaves the house now, she said.

“Even if it’s hot, I’ll wear this,” she said, showing a green puffy jacket and ankle-length black pants.  

Without her husband’s salary and work permit, Jefferson’s wife doesn’t have much money coming in. Although she also requested asylum and work permission, her case is still pending.

After her husband was taken into custody, she began making queso llanero, a Venezuelan cheese, and offering manicures to neighbors, bringing in a little money to feed the kids and send her husband commissary funds so he could buy instant noodles in the ICE detention center. 

Since his detention, she's struggled to find good work. A recent apartment-cleaning gig paid only $120 for two days. It almost wasn't worth the effort, but she needed the money, she said. 

“Every day I see what I can do to get money because I have to pay for my children's things,” she said. “I do everything because I have to keep going for my kids.” 

While she’s trying to make ends meet, she wonders how her husband is being treated in prison.  

Before he was deported, he’d been promoted at work and given new uniform shirts. He never got the chance to wear them. They sit folded, tags still on them, inside the bedroom the family shares. 

To prove Laya Freites is innocent, his wife is tracking down criminal records from Venezuela to show U.S. officials, hoping that someone will resolve what she sees as a terrible mistake. 

Taking a sip of her Nescafé instant coffee and tearing up, she said, “I don't see how what's happening is fair.""

The last time they talked, from the Texas detention center, Jefferson apologized to his wife for not being able to achieve what they wanted in the United States.

CHAPTER TWO

Don’t die. Don’t freeze. Just move.

I don’t know how long I sat there, chest sticky with sweat and breath caught somewhere between now and never. But eventually, my legs stopped shaking enough to stand. Not stable, not strong  just enough.

I wiped my face with the sleeve of my hoodie. It came away damp and salty. Brilliant. Apocalypse hottie red-eyed, crusty, and hollow.

Dora gave a soft whine, brushing her nose against my arm like she was checking I still worked. I didn’t feel like I did. Not really. But I was vertical again, and apparently that was enough.

“We have to move,” I told her quietly.

She wagged her tail.

God help me, she thought this was a walk.

But where the hell were we supposed to go?

Standing there on the street, exposed and vulnerable, the question sat in my mouth like broken glass. 

I should’ve thought about this before leaving. 

Should’ve packed better. Should’ve planned more. 

Should’ve done a lot of things, but my brain doesn’t work that way.

Never has.

It’s always been action first, think later. I don’t know why I do it  it’s not bravery, not really. Just panic dressed up as instinct.

I thought I’d grown out of it. But here I was again. Nowhere to go, barely any food, and not a single bloody idea what came next.

Poor decisions flickered behind my eyelids like a horror reel  the time I quit a job without a backup, the night I told my ex I was “fine” and stormed out barefoot, the blackout in Magaluf where I woke up missing an earring a full day with two new tattoos..

I shoved the memories back down. Can’t afford that now.

Focus.

Plan.

First thought: food.

We’d barely scraped by with what I had left in the flat. The bag felt stupidly light. I’d packed panic, not survival. A protein bar, Dora’s dental sticks, clingfilmed cheese like that was going to last more than five minutes.

I scanned the street. The corner shop, the one next to the petrol station, was just a block up.

Too easy. Too obvious.

And worse?

It was the same direction that thing went. The one that heard us. That staggered away only because something louder had grabbed its attention.

I couldn’t risk going back that way. Not even for food.

And I’m not fucking stupid.

So that left us one direction, away.

I turned my back to the corner shop and the horror behind it, tugging Dora gently to heel. She resisted at first, confused. The lead pulled taut between us like she thought I’d made a mistake. “But that’s the way we usually go Mum.”

“Nope,” I muttered. “That’s where death is. We’re going this way.”

We started walking. Not quickly. Not confidently. Just… cautiously. Like every footstep might be the wrong one.

Eyes up. Ears alert.

My body was still humming with adrenaline, but my brain was thick. Foggy. It’s hard to think when every part of you is screaming survive. Hard to form a proper plan when you’re expecting every parked car to lurch forward and bite your leg off.

I kept flinching at shadows. Jumping at gusts of wind.

Every movement felt suspicious. Every noise felt like a threat.

And I hated it.

Okay. Plan. Focus. Keep it simple.

Where was safe?

My mind started flipping through names like it was going through a contacts list I hadn’t touched in months.

Liam – Manchester. Too far. Might as well be another country now.

Harry – lived in a village outside Derby, Hilton I think, or was it Hatton? Somewhere leafy. Quiet. I’d been there once for a BBQ that ended in wasp-related screaming. Couldn’t tell you the name of the street. Or the postcode. Or even which bloody house it was in. Useless.

Dad – Cornwall.

My chest twisted. Sharp and soft all at once.
It had been too long. We hadn’t fallen out or anything dramatic. Just drifted. A few texts here and there. The odd “miss you too, flower.” Then silence. Life got in the way. It always did.

I pictured him now sat on that pebble beach near his house, windbreaker zipped to the neck, holding a mug of some horrible flavoured coffee. No idea if he even knew what was happening. Maybe it hadn’t reached there yet. Maybe he was still safe.

A lump caught in my throat before I could stop it.
I swallowed hard. Kept walking.

That left Mum.

Last known location: Burton-on-Trent. Good olde BOT. Twenty minutes by car. Four, maybe five hours on foot. Longer with Dora. Even longer if I took the quiet route, back lanes and country tracks. Safer than the A38 or the main roads, but winding. Rural. Isolated.

I didn’t have a choice.
Dora couldn’t read a map, and I couldn’t drive a car. So it was legs or nothing.

“Mum it is,” I whispered. “Let’s hope you’re home.”
The idea of seeing her, safe, well, bossy as ever,  it made my chest ache.

It also made me move faster.

I kept to the pavements, head down but eyes up. Ears straining for the scrape of limbs or the wrong kind of shuffle.

Most of the houses we passed had their curtains drawn. Some had doors wide open. One had a car halfway through a front wall, hazard lights still blinking in a slow, useless rhythm.

Dora kept sniffing the air, tail twitching, but she didn’t bark again. Thank god. Maybe she’d finally realised the rules had changed.

We weren’t in our flat anymore. We weren’t anywhere anymore.

The world had shifted sideways, and we were just trying not to fall off the edge.

Ten minutes down the road, my breath had evened out.

Sort of.

Still jittery, still on edge, but no longer drowning in it.
The worst part?

I couldn’t tell if it was safer here or just quieter.
Quiet used to mean peace. Safety.

Now it meant… waiting.

Like the whole world was holding its breath, waiting to see who moved first.

Me?

I wasn’t ready to stop walking yet.

And maybe that’s all survival is.

Putting one foot in front of the other.

Even if you don’t know where you’re going.

We were about fifteen minutes in when I saw it.

A car, slanted halfway onto the pavement like it had been parked by a ghost in a rush. Bonnet dented. 

Driver’s door open. No sign of life.

Or death. Yet.

I slowed. Dora did too.

We were both panting, not just from the walk,  but from the constant, crawling dread that clung to everything like damp.

“Quick look,” I muttered.

I stepped closer, peering in like it might suddenly scream. It didn’t. Just smelled like Monster energy, Lynx Africa, and bad decisions. The glove box was slightly ajar. I nudged it open with the hammer.

Jackpot.

• Packet of Fox’s Glacier Mints


• Half a packet of Digestives


• A bottle of Lucozade, orange,,warm as piss but sealed.


I stuffed it all in my bag like it was gold. Had a mint halfway to my mouth when I heard it.

“Oiii, B…”

Loud. Male. Laughing. Too close.

Too familiar.

Too alive.

Shit.
I froze. Mint in mouth. Head still half in the car.

Four of them. Hooded up. Joggers halfway down their arses. Tracksuits shiny enough to be seen from space.

One had a bum bag across his chest like he was smuggling vapes.

Another was already adjusting his package like his brain needed reminding it was still there.

“Yo, what’s a fine little ting like you doing out here all alone?” one said.

Voice full slime. Croaky and confident.

I didn’t move. Didn’t even look at them yet.

You can’t reason with groups like this. You don’t respond. You deflect. You walk.

“Jeremy Kyle‘s reject list made it out somehow,” I muttered. Not even sure why I said it. Could’ve left. Could’ve walked. Could’ve shut up.

But no.

I always had to say something.

And of course, they heard me.

One of them snorted, ugly and sharp. “What’d you say?”

I straightened. My mouth still tasted of mint and regret.

“I said”

Then I saw their faces properly. And regretted everything.

The tallest one with the bum bag stepped forward, clearly the ringleader. Built like he skipped leg day religiously. Square shoulders, smug smirk, bad tattoo peeking out from under his sleeve, some initials, maybe, or a brand logo he thought was deep. He walked like he expected the pavement to part for him.

“You got mouth, yeah? You got that attitude ‘cause you got that bunda?”

Oh my god, what in the actual fuck is going on. 

Before I could roll my eyes or run, the skinny, twitchy one, with the energy of someone who thought he was the next big thing on TikTok  let out a laugh and immediately launched into a rap

Yes. A rap.

“Yo, apocalypse sweetie with the thighs and the curls, I’d fight off ten zombies just to make you my girl.”

He ended with a chest tap and a wink. I blinked.

He grinned, genuinely proud of himself, then flicked his tongue across his teeth like that was the clinche.

My soul physically recoiled.

My brain stuttered.

Why did I always attract the knock-off rapper types?
Where’s my nice nervous curly-haired guy like in Zombieland?

Ellie got Joel, strong, brooding, emotionally damaged but reliable.

Even Rick from The Walking Dead had a rugged dad vibe.

And me?

I get Central Cee: Zombie MixTape Edition.

The world is cruel.

Before I could back away, another one shorter, but stocky slung his arm around my shoulders. He had a round face, a trimmed beard that didn’t suit him, and eyes that didn’t blink enough. His cologne hit first, something heavy and sweet, like a body spray aisle had exploded.

That’s when Dora growled. Loud. Sharp.

I froze.

Dora never growled at men. She liked men. Loved them, even. Wagged at delivery drivers like she’d known them in a past life. Dora barked at bins, pigeons, her own tail but she was fond of men.

This was different.

She was stiff. Eyes narrowed. Hackles up.

A warning.

The arm stayed on my shoulders. Heavy. Clingy.
The guy noticed. “What, your dog got beef?”
“She’s got taste,” I said, voice flat.

The guy laughed, but there was a twist to it now. Like my words had peeled something back.

“She’s a bit mouthy,”  one muttered behind us.
“Nah, I like ’em spicy,” said the one with his arm on me. “We’ll look after you, girl. Proper protection, innit. Real men.”

I swallowed the mint and my panic. It lodged halfway down.

I am going to die in a JD Sports Advert.

I tried to duck out from under his arm, but he tightened it.

“Don’t be like that, B,” he said, voice low and oily. “You’re out here alone. World’s dangerous. You need someone like me.”

“No,” I said. Voice flat. “I don’t.”

And again, again I saw the shift.

The puffed chest. The slight stiffening. The look like I’d just  bruised his little ego.

One of the others laughed. “You look uncomfortable, babes. You good?”

Oh, now we care about consent?

“Maybe she needs a bit of convincing,” someone else muttered.

Everything inside me snapped tight.

I twisted out from under the arm. Dora barked. Loud.

“Back off.”

They didn’t like that.

“Chill out, fam, she’s being bare disrespectful.”
“Look at the state of her”

“She should be grateful, man, look what we’re offering.”

A shouting match kicked off. Amongst them now. Posturing. Bumping chests.

I backed up, hammer in one hand, Dora’s lead tight in the other. Her body was rigid, all warning.

Then it happened, I’m not even sure how it happened. 

The one who grabbed me shoved another. That one swung back. A punch landed. Someone yelled..
And somewhere, something heard it.

A rasping groan answered. Then another.
“Oi” one shouted, too late.

Shadows moved at the end of the street.
Then teeth.
Blood.

The one who had touched me,, turned toward the dead like he was about to swing fists at them too.
“I got this!” he yelled.

No you bloody don’t.

Dora and I ran.

Full sprint. No goodbye. No guilt. Just survival.
I heard him behind us  “Oi, she’s running!” then screams. Wet. Ragged. One voice cut off mid-sentence.

I looked back once.

He was down. Blood blooming around him.

The dead were coming.

And they’d seen me.

We ran harder.

Down an alley I didn’t recognise, bins toppling, feet slipping. Dora skidded on a takeaway box. I nearly lost the bag.

Sharp right. Narrow pass. Over a wall. Clothes caught, clothes tore.

We kept going.

I didn’t know where we were. Somewhere in Derby I’d never seen. The kind of street you’d only end up on if you took a wrong turn looking for parking or was trying to Taxi jump a driver to get out of paying.
Eventually we collapsed behind a hedge, behind a gate, behind the edge of something almost safe.
Dora panted beside me, tongue out, sides heaving.

“What the fuck was that,” I breathed.

I didn’t expect an answer.

My heart still thumped like a drum in my throat, but my lungs had stopped trying to collapse. My fingers weren’t shaking anymore. My brain… sort of rebooted. Glitchy, but functioning.

I leaned against the wall, dragging in shallow breaths, and blinked up at the sky. Grey. Still. The kind of grey that had no personality. Just blank.
Dora panted beside me, tail twitching slightly. Still ready. Still trusting.

“Okay,” I whispered. “We’re okay. You did good. You did so good.”

She licked my cheek like it was nothing, like death hadn’t just almost high-fived us.

I stood slowly, checking the street. Quiet again. Too quiet. But I knew this bit the hedge, the street layout, the layout of the buildings. We weren’t that far from the Tenpin bowling alley.

A weird sort of warmth hit my chest. God, Tenpin.

They used to do the best nachos. Cheese and salsa and guac and sour cream with crispy onions if you asked nicely though I usually didn’t. I was a bad loser, an even worse winner, one of those annoying people who took every game personally. Bowling was war. Especially if my brothers were there.

I swallowed, blinking hard against the sting behind my eyes.

Dora sniffed the air beside me, totally unaware I was about to cry over nachos and bowling pins.

My stomach growled loud enough to make her jump.
“Yeah,” I muttered. “I hear you.”

I spotted a small garden behind a broken gate, tucked between two semi-detached houses. Empty. Overgrown. Still. It’d do.

We slipped through the gap in the fence, crouching beside a moss-covered picnic bench like squatters at a silent festival.

I unclipped Dora’s lead and pulled the bag around. Time for the apocalypse feast.

A bottle of warm Lucozade. A crumpled packet of biscuits. One last flapjack I’d been hoarding like it was gold.

For Dora:  a dental stick, and of course, the cheese slices

“The cheese tax,” I told her as she wagged expectantly. “It’s law.”

She took them each gently, mouth soft around my fingers like she knew. Like she appreciated it.

We sat there in silence, chewing quietly, surrounded by birdsong that felt too cheerful. Almost fake. Like nature didn’t get the memo.

I wiped my mouth, sat back, and finally said it out loud. “We need to get out of Derby.”

It was too built up. Too many flats. Too many corner shops and narrow streets where anything could be waiting. We needed space. Air. Somewhere rural, where I could hear things coming. Somewhere with fewer people. Fewer dead.

I knew the route. I’d walked some of it before, during lockdowns or mental breakdowns, the overlap was real.

“We’ll head through Sinfin,” I told Dora, who blinked slowly like she was listening. “Cut through and walk the canal path, follow that through to Willington.”

From there, we could hit Repton. Quiet. Pretty. And crucially, halfway to Mum’s.

“I used to work there, remember?” I said. “Repton School. Fancy boarding school. Rich kids. Roald Dahl went there. Jeremy Clarkson too, so, swings and roundabouts not that you know what or who I’m on about .” I smile at her.

Dora tilted her head.

“Each building’s got its own kitchen,” I added. “And it’s the school holidays. Should be empty. Should.”

No guarantees anymore.

But it was a goal. A dot on the mental map. Something more than just walking away from danger, now we were walking towards something.
“Nanny’s next,” I whispered. “We’ll get to her. I promise.”

Dora licked her lips and rested her head against my leg.

I pulled my hoodie tighter, slung the bag back over my shoulder, and clipped her lead again.

“No more delays. Let’s get going.”

We stepped back into the street. Still quiet. Still dangerous.

But now?

We had a plan.

Chapter one: Live A Little

Camilla

My life sucks, all I have ever wanted was to be loved and taken care of but I guess I was too cursed to experience happiness in my life. My biological father abandoned us and disappeared without any trace. My mother always comes back home drunk, she doesn't have an iota of love towards me nor do I get any motherly love, all she cares about is her alcohol and her new found man who happens to be my stepfather now.

I was deprived of both motherly and fatherly love at a very young age. My stepfather would do anything in this world to get rid of me but I was too strong to let him succeed in his plan.

To save my life from my stepfather, I moved out of the house and went to live with my boyfriend in another city. But still couldn't be loved and cared for. Maybe I am being a little dramatic but I swear this world is against me.

I honestly can't remember the last time I had a good day. This morning, my dumb ass boyfriend thought that it was okay to turn off my eight o'clock alarm and just replace it with his own. The alarm was set for an hour later than what I needed, like hell, what is wrong with him?

The purpose of the alarm was to wake me up and go to the gym but I wouldn't be surprised if I came home later to find him on the couch in the same position I left him. It is fair to say that things have been a little rough between us recently but once again, I have to force myself to remember that if I wait just a little longer, things will get better.

Our relationship was never one of those all consuming romances you may have heard of but Robin is nice and that's enough for me. He didn't abandon me even when everyone else did.

His stupidity this morning made me miss a meeting with a client. I am an event planner. I was supposed to meet a couple this morning concerning their upcoming wedding but my idiot boyfriend made me miss that. On top of that, my lack of coordination caused me to trip on something and ripping my stocking in the process. I just wanted to be happy in life. Is that really too much to ask?

Coming out of the gym house, I decided to branch to the only place that ever brought happiness in my life. A coffee shop that wasn't too far from my house. I came here on a daily basis to ease out some stress.

Opening the door, I was greeted by the wonderful smell of freshly baked goods and coffee grinds, filling the whole place.

""Camilla is that you?"" A familiar voice called out from the kitchen before the counter.

The owner of the cafe, Susan Kanu. She is the most kindhearted woman I have ever known but she can sometimes be scary as well. I can only be thankful that I am on her good side because despite her old age, I wouldn't put it past her to be able to make even the toughest men run away crying.

""Hello, Mrs. Kanu."" I replied, walking towards the sound of her voice.

Peaking around the corner, I saw her petite figure standing with her arms crossed and facing my direction.

""What did I tell you?"" She said with a slight warning in her tone.

""Hello, Susan."" I quickly corrected myself, catching onto what she meant.

For some unknown reason she was very adamant on me calling her by her first name. I am not sure of the reason but either way my response caused a bright smile to spread across her face.

""What brings you here at this time of the day?"" She asked as I helped her carry the tray of baked snacks over to the counter.

""Robin turned off my alarm, so I had to reschedule the meeting I had initially booked at nine o'clock this morning. I was just coming out from the gym, heading back home to see him but I am definitely going to need some coffee before that happens.""

I heard her let out a disapproving sigh and I already knew what was about to leave her mouth before she even said it.

""Why do you still stay with that boy? We both know he has the brain of a rock and it is not like he is giving you any good…""

""Susan,"" I interrupted, stopping her from what she was about to say.

Just because she is right doesn't mean it has to be said. It only served as a reminder of how touch deprived I am. The thing about Susan is that she is as blunt as you ever think of.

""He is ni…."" I started, feeling the need to defend my boyfriend but I was cut off.

""Let me guess, he is nice to you?""

""Yes and he treats….""

""Treats you well? My dear, I hate to break it to you but that is another way of saying he is boring.""

She is right and that is why I stopped protesting but Robin is all I have ever known. He knows every damn thing about me, I feel safe with him and if he is going to leave me, he would have done it by now. Now matter how much baggage I may carry, Robin wasn't scared off by it.

It has really been a rough life for me, it has been almost a year since my father disappeared and still there is no sign of him. Even the police and other detectives couldn't trace his whereabouts, they said his disappearance was voluntary. The little that I knew him he wouldn't go hiding without a good reason.

Most people think that he is a heartless monster which in some way I have to admit but at the same time, never once in my childhood did he make me feel neglected or unsafe. He started teaching me self defense from the time I could walk. I vividly remember him telling me on my tenth birthday that he wouldn't be around forever and that once he was gone, the only person I could rely on was myself. And that day happens to be the first time he thought of how to use a gun. He gave me a gun as my birthday gift.

My father might be crazy by doing that but I still love him nevertheless. I already knew it was going to be very impossible to figure out where he was, no one found him unless he wanted them to. I can only hope he either reveals himself or decides to come out of hiding.

My private detective has been trying to track him for the last seven months but so far nothing has come out of it and it only leaves me more and more disappointed. And that is why I am still staying with Robin. I have lost so much and I am sick of everything in my life changing, he is the only consistent thing as of right now and I wasn't prepared to lose that yet.

Not responding to Susan's early question, she continues speaking.

""You are twenty-five years old, you should be going out to clubs and meeting new people. Let yourself live a little and before you know it, you will be old like me wishing you would have just loosened up more while you still can."" I smiled at her words.

I wish I could have argued with what she said but the truth is that I would be lying if I said I had a good social life. I used to go out with my friends a lot but ever since I moved here with Robin, I haven't been able to meet new people and besides he doesn't like to go out that much. He prefers that I stay home with him and the last time I went out, it didn't go well. I went to a club without him and when I came back home that night, he scolded me for dressing like a slut and then refused to sleep in the same bed with me for almost a week. I cried so hard that night but he eventually came to his senses and apologized.

I knew apologizing can't justify his actions but at this point, I can't even remember what my life was like without him and for that reason, I chose to let it go. I grabbed my takeout coffee and dug into my bag to grab some cash to pay but Susan stopped me with a glare.

""Don't even think about it.""

Not wanting to argue, I sneaked the cash into her tip jar before she could protest. She always gets upset whenever I pay for anything in her cafe. With a smile on my face, I moved around the counter and placed a kiss on her cheeks which managed to remove the pout on her face.

""Bye, Susan.""

""Have fun with your boyfriend."" I shook my head before closing the glass door behind me.

# Chapter 2: Cheated

Chapter two: Cheated

Camilla

I left the cafe in my small old version of a car and found myself in my parking lobby after a few minutes of driving. I grabbed my coffee and stepped out of the car, walking up to the front porch and when I opened the door, I was left shattered. The scene unfolding before me was unimaginable.

""What the hell, Robin?"" I yelled, slamming the front door behind me and dropping my bag on the floor.

I had accepted the fact that today was simply a bad day and that I needed to sleep it off. However, the last thing I expected was to come home to find my boyfriend of three years having sex with whom I would picture to be a human version of Barbie.

That is just the problem of men, the majority of them only know how to think with their cóck. I would rather have him just break up with me instead of putting me in a position where I had to see this.

""Babe?"" He startled, throwing the bitch off his lap.

""What are you doing home so early?""

I just stood there silently in disbelief as he scrambled to find his pants and the girl slipped on his shirt. I could feel the anger building up inside me and in that moment, I wondered how hard it would be to get away with murder.

""Camilla?"" I subconsciously heard someone's voice.

I mean getting away with murder can't be that hard, can it?

""Camilla?"" I heard that voice again, snapping out of my unrealistic wistful thought and raising my head to meet him.

""Some asshole turned off my alarm this morning and caused me to miss my meeting."" I said, accusingly.

""You want to tell me why I walked into my own house to find you fúcking another woman?""

""Listen sweetie, you can't blame him for finding someone to fulfill the needs that you can't meet."" The girl said with a smirk on her face.

Gosh, her voice is whiny, high pitched and just as fake as her boobs. Directing my attention to her, I caught her looking me up and down with a disgusted look.

""At least I don't rely on fucking with already taken people to feel good about myself."" Her smirk was replaced with a glare.

It was true that my sex life with Robin was pretty non-existent but it is not my fault that he doesn't know how to make a woman cum. At this point, I can't tell whether there is something wrong with me or if it is just the fact that the guy had no techniques. I am guessing it is the last one, Robin doesn't know how to make me cum and I don't know why I felt he can't handle me alone when it comes to sex. But I don't get why the hell this girl over here thinks she has accomplished something by having sex with him.

Though I am hurt and angry, if she wants Robin, she can have him. I refused to waste any more of my time fighting for someone who doesn't want me.

""Babe, please don't be mad. I can fix this."" He pleaded, clearing sensing the wave of anger radiating from me right now.

I felt weird, in the past conflict, I would practically just shut down but in this moment, I knew I was done submitting to him and all of his bullshit. At this point, my body was filled with bottled up emotions and its containment was about to explode, leaving me pissed off and fed up.

""Don't call me that! You lost the right the second I walked through this door and saw another woman on your lap!""

""Camilla, come on. Don't be like that.""

""Be like what exactly? Pissed off that my boyfriend of three years cheated on me? It is okay if you lost interest in me but you should have just ended things.""

""Babe come on, you don't have to be….""

""How long have you been seeing her?"" I cut him off, not interested in hearing whatever he has to say anymore.

""This is the first time."" He responded with a desperation in his voice but the girl said otherwise.

""One year now, you can't meet up with his sexual needs so he came to me."" The girl said.

I slightly tilt my head back in an attempt to prevent my tears from rolling down. It didn't take me long to do the calculation in my head. My father went missing one year ago, I guess my baggage ended up driving him away after all.

But have they known each other before I moved in with him? This so fucked up. I took a deep breath, forcing my tears back, he doesn't deserve them anymore.

""Camilla please, you don't have to be so dramatic. I love you and you know it."" Before I could respond, the girl spoke.

""As much as this is entertaining, I have somewhere else to be. I am out.""

Avoiding my gaze, she walked into my bedroom before returning with her bra, panties and a pair of heels in her hands. I am starting to feel nauseous at this moment, he fúcked her in the same bed we had made love countless times? She looked at Robin and winked at him before walking shamelessly out of the house.

We were left in an awkward silence, neither of us knew what to say next. But I was eagerly ready to break the silence.

""We are done."" I said, moving from the spot I was since I came in.

""What? No!"" He cried out but I chose to ignore his hysterics.

Walking towards what used to be our bedroom, he followed me behind. Seeing the bed I had neatly made this morning, the sheets are now in a heap on the floor. I pushed down my emotions and opened the closet, managing to drown out the sobs coming from the man behind me.

This guy really lost it. Firstly, he cheated on me and now he thinks he has the right to cry over me when I said we were done. The worst part of this scenario is that if I didn't come home early today, this would have continued behind my back for goodness knows how much longer.

Ignoring his continuous yet meaningless pleas, I grabbed my suitcase from the top rack of the closet and started packing my clothes, not caring if I am making a mess, he can clean that up later. I know that I will need to come back soon to grab the rest of my things but this should be enough to stay away from him for the next few weeks.

""Where are you going?"" He asked, finally slowing his pathetic cries.

""It is not like you have any family members here.""

""Yes, and who's fault is that by the way?"" I snapped back.

When I first met Robin, I was halfway through my Management and Planning in the university while he was working for a Navy department in town. We bumped into each other at a bar and one thing led to the other which ended with me waking up in his bed the next day naked. The sex was mediocre but he made me smile like no one else ever had and at that time, it was enough for me.

Ignoring him, I went into the bathroom to grab my toiletries. I zipped up my bag and headed for the front door.

""Where are you going?"" I ignored him, the sooner I leave, the better for both of us.

""Camila? Are you listening to me?"" I didn't respond.

""I said, where are you going?"" Still kept quiet.

""Hello? Stop!"" He suddenly demanded, anger lacing now in his voice.

""You can't leave after everything I have done for you, you have nothing without me. You have no family, no friends, you are absolutely nothing without me."" His tears are now completely gone and was now replaced with rage.

Gosh, how did I let myself become so blind that I only just realized how manipulative he is. I seriously needed to get out of here very fast. Still walking towards the front door, he appeared in front of me, blocking my way.

""Get the hell out of my way, Robin!"" I yelled, attempting to maneuver myself around him but luck wasn't on my side.

I tried again but he grabbed me and shoved me so that my back was against the front door, using his heavy mass to keep me pinned.

""You are overreacting over nothing."" He said slowly as if he thinks his soft tone will somehow calm me down.

""She means nothing to me. You are the one I want. I love you.""

I stopped trying to free myself from his grip at his words. That was another thing about him, things were great with him until they weren't.

At first, he was so sweet and would always find a way to make me smile even when I didn't think it was possible. He was the first guy I was even serious with but he also knows how to make me feel worthless and was the one who taught me just how painful words can be.

**When did it all start?** Oh, yes… In the damn moment that I accepted his proposal and became his girlfriend. If I had known this would happen, I would never have done that.

Another empty drink on the counter bitters my stomach; it dampens my nerves and makes my head foggy.

I gesture to the barman to bring me another one of those — *what was it again?*

Leaning over the counter with my head resting on my arms, I close my eyes and allow myself to relive those damn scenes that brought me to this busy bar in downtown New York… a place that’s always full, regardless of whether it’s a Monday. But unlike all the others who are there to enjoy themselves, I’m just drowning in the disappointment that’s eating me inside.

It’s all because of Eric… My scumbag boyfriend.

Well, *ex-boyfriend*…

It was supposed to be a surprise… He’s so busy with his work, being a successful manager, that lately we have no time together. That’s why I decided to go to his house, cook his favorite food, and maybe give him *something else*. I bought all the ingredients and went happily to his apartment… Of course, I should have known something was wrong when I turned the spare key and noticed his shoes and red heels were carelessly tossed on the floor.

Eric is so… organized. Even when rushing, he doesn’t leave his shoes like this.

But those red heels made a chill go up my spine. I already knew what was coming because I don’t wear high heels — not even red ones. And inside my head, a voice was screaming, telling me to get out of there, to close my eyes and turn my back… But my stubbornness made my legs take on a life of their own.

My footsteps were so silent that even I couldn’t hear them. All I could feel was my heart pounding frantically, threatening to climb into my throat. And with each step towards the half-open door, the noises became more audible — the sound of a kiss, the hollow slam of hips, and husky moans that come from deep in the throats.

Standing in front of the door, I heard my boyfriend’s voice say in a tone that I’d never heard… a voice that showed lust. *“You’re so hot, uhn, ride me, babe.”*

And at that moment, my stomach twisted.

I felt my conviction fail and started to turn away… but then, a woman’s moans echoed through my ears… She said, *“Are you enjoying it? No one makes you feel good as I do, right?”*

My heart stopped beating in that second, but somehow, I was able to open the door quickly, and its noise was louder than the sound of sex.

… And I saw them.

Naked — completely naked.

They noticed me immediately; their faces contorted in extreme surprise and confusion. But I still remember how the red-haired woman, an extremely familiar redhead, was on top of my boyfriend, riding him.

It’s my damn best friend.

My world came crashing down, as did the ingredients I was holding. She pulled back the sheet, and he tripped over his clothes, putting on his underwear awkwardly.

I even remember him saying, *“Angel? What are you doing here?”*

He looked at me and at Laura with a worried expression.

But I blinked a few times, taking in the scene with a mixture of surprise, horror, and curiosity. I knew my eyes were glistening with tears because everything looked blurry in front of me. I spit my lips apart, but they didn’t make a sound.

I simply couldn’t believe that, in our four years of dating, we never had sex. And yet, there he was… with my best friend.

Maybe I was in shock because, despite his protests, I left without saying a word. My legs just acted on their own again, and even as he followed me through the house, I didn’t even look back.

The door I slammed sounded so loud that it still resonates inside my head as I’m standing dumped in this bar, with more alcohol in my system than everything I’ve consumed in those twenty-three years of my life.

Open my eyes, I notice that my drink hasn’t arrived yet. I lift my head and look at the barman, who is looking in another direction. My eyes follow them as if attracted by magnetism… And my expression of confusion soon turns to surprise and dread because a man is walking towards me.

I scratch my eyes, hoping it’s a mirage, an illusion because of the alcohol.

It’s not.

He stops in front of me with a serious expression. His crossed arms bounce off his white shirt, which fits very well on that slightly tanned skin, and it looks so small on his body that it marks every muscle, including his eight packs.

“*Heyyy*, have you put on weight?” I ask in a slurred voice.

“Angelee.” His voice sounds firm, somewhat angry.

I struggle to take my eyes off his tall body that I shouldn’t notice… oh, heavens, I really shouldn’t notice it.

“What are you doing here, Mr. Adams?” I threw my body forward slightly and almost fell off the bench. Fortunately, he’s there to serve me as a wall, and I lean my breasts against his belly, feeling how hard his body is… like a rock.

Raising my eyes, I see that he’s also looking at me… directly into my brown eyes. His hands are on my shoulders, holding me tightly, but his touch is kind, even if he’s pulling our bodies apart.

“I should be asking you this. What are you doing here?” He asks, still with his grave tone, bringing pleasurable shivers to my skin.

“Well, I came to celebrate that I’m single!” I shrug, freeing myself of his hands, and prop my breasts up on the counter, making my cleavage reveal a bit more. “That bastard Eric was sleeping with Laura; can you believe that?”

I snort, with anger and sadness mingling in my slurred words, “It’s not enough that he’s cheating on me... did it really need to be with my best friend?”

Bringing my eyes up to him again, I notice that his gaze is soft now, “Why are you looking at me like that, Mr. Adams?”

“Mr. Adams? Why are you acting so formal?” He brings his hand up to my head and messes up my brown hair in an awkward caress. “We’re not at work now.”

“Oh, that’s right…” I give him a smile, “Right…”

“You’re drunk, Angel. I’m taking you home-”

“No, I don’t want to leave…!” I mumble, leaning towards him again, gripping his waist tightly, “I don’t want to be alone, Julian…”

He passes his arms around my body, and his embrace is warm enough to bring tears to my eyes…

Gosh, his caring touch and gentle hands running down my arms are really awaking things in me. Maybe it’s the drink or the fragility in the face of this terrible situation, but I want to stay in his arms — so I squeeze him tighter, brushing my body against his.

… It reminds me of feelings that I buried a long ago.

“Come on, Angel. We can watch those cheesy movies you like.” He slides his hand through my hair again, pulling it away from my bare shoulders. “It’s better than booze for healing a broken heart-”

“I’m not heartbroken, Julian... *I’m furious!*” I quickly pull away, tightly clutching my hands to his shirt. “He was screwing my best friend but never had sex with me!”

“Angelee…” He’s speechless, looking around, noticing that my tone draws attention.

“He’s a bastard!” I shout and get up from the bench with difficulty, tripping over my legs, “I hate him!”

Julian sighs deeply and passes his arm around my small body, easily supporting me with one hand. With the other, he pulls out his wallet and throws a few hundred bills on the counter, giving the waiter an apologetic smile, “You can keep the change-”

“Damn you!” I shout, remembering that unpleasant scene again. “I’m going to kill you, Eric! I’m going to poison that fucking pie turd!”

Julian drags me out of the bar as I fire curses to the heavens, all directed at that Eric bastard. And just as my throat starts to hurt, I stop and look around, noticing that we’re somehow in front of Julian’s sports car, his baby — as he usually calls it. A black car that, even in the darkness of night, sparkles to the eye.

“Can I drive it?” I point at the car with a giant smile.

“Are you kidding?” He crosses his arms, again drawing my eyes…

What’s wrong with me, anyway?

Julian is… not someone I should look at that way… He’s my father’s best friend!

But still, I catch myself moistening my lips slightly, looking at his body, which is simply a sin. The hours spent in the gym are certainly worth it. And despite my efforts, Julian notices my reaction and a slight cocky smile appears on his lips.

Without saying a single word, he opens the car door and points inside, “Let’s go, Angelee.”

Obeying without complaint, I turn toward him and find that he’s leaning over me, pulling on my seat belt. My eyes sustain his green eyes for a moment, and then I lower them to his lips.

Julian’s scent invades my nostrils — a subtle, masculine cologne that lights a flame in my body, on my lower belly…

I close my legs, pressing my knees against each other, and look away, listening to the low laughter humming in my ears.

“Okay, let’s go home, girl…”

# 02 — Little Angel

Hell.

Fighting a hangover really is hell.

I open my eyes with difficulty, finding a terrible brightness. I groan, turning to the side and it again so my head doesn’t hurt anymore… But realization kicks me, and I suddenly open them once more, jumping up and sitting on the bed BECAUSE THIS ISN’T MY ROOM!

Oh, no.

Running my hand over the white sheets, I let out another grunt, throwing my back again on the mattress…

Damn it.

With my eyes tightly closed, I replay the scenes from last night.

*Buying ingredients to make a pie.*

*Going to Eric’s house.*

*Finding Eric and Laura… Naked.*

*Drowning my sorrows in booze.*

*Meeting Julian Adams.*

Argh! I finally understand why I ended up in Julian’s room… But of all the people I could meet, did it have to be him?

I get out of bed and glance in the mirror, noticing that not only are my eyes smeared with black makeup, my hair is messy, and I have an incredibly hungover expression, but I’m wearing a white shirt much bigger than my body, and that reaches my mid-thigh.

“Great, Angelee…” I mumble at last, entirely ignoring the chaos that’s my appearance and leaving the room to find, who knows, some strong coffee… And *who knows,* Julian may have already left for the company, and I won’t have to deal with this great humiliation…

Yep, it was too soon to say it.

I stop, freezing because Julian is there, leaning against the kitchen island, with a cup of coffee in hand and exposed abs… very exposed.

When his green eyes pause on me, he’s swallowing his coffee, which makes his Adam’s apple move. He lowers his mug, lifting the corner of his lips, “Good morning, Angel.”

I force a smile and move closer to him, reaching over the island to grab the coffee pot and a cup. But because of this innocent movement, my shirt lifts dangerously, revealing a bit of my butt. And I can swear that I see Julian staring at how I’m stretching out, almost sticking my belly on the counter… I catch his eyes going down my hips to my thighs… But he quickly looks away and clears his throat, taking a generous sip of the bitter coffee.

His gaze makes me feel funny even if he didn’t mean to.

When I finally reach over and start putting the coffee in the cup, I massage my temple while the proper dose of caffeine is put in. I even try to bend over again to return the pot to its place, but Julian takes it from my hands and, with extreme ease, puts it back.

I blink in surprise and say with sincere admiration, “What wonderful arms!”

Julian gives a sarcastic smile, “I work them to be.”

“Oh, I can see the effect…” I squeeze his muscle, noting how it’s stiff, and I smile mischievously, “Have you really put on weight?”

“Huh, so you remember that serious offense?” Julian raises an eyebrow.

“Hey, don’t be like that, that’s a compliment!” I slide my hand to his abs, lightly scratching the eight packs, “Keep it up; I’m supporting you.”

Julian clears his throat again, probably feeling a chill caused by my fingernails. Then he adds, in a mischievous voice, “You like my body, huh.”

“It’s good for the eyes, of course I do.” A naughty smile appears on my lips, and I shrug, bringing the cup to my lips. “I can understand why you’re so successful with women.”

He scratches the back of his neck, and I don’t pay much attention to his annoyed expression as I turn away, walking over to the couch… I just listen to him breathing deeply.

“By the way, did you change me?” I ask, throwing myself onto the couch and sipping my coffee. “Your shirt looks great on me. Should I try this style?”

“Very funny. You threw up on your clothes, and I wouldn’t let you anywhere near my bed all puked up.” He grimaces, probably because he had to quickly pick up my clothes and throw them in the washer. “You’re welcome, by the way.”

“Why would I thank you?” I look back over my shoulder, over the couch.

“They called your emergency contact because they would rather not leave a drunk girl alone. Your emergency contact is the *company,* but your father isn’t here… Have you forgotten that he’s traveling on business? I had to go instead…” He points at me, “And for that, you should thank me.”

“You were working that late? I thought your nights were reserved for women.”

Julian smiles sarcastically and places the empty cup on the counter, “Do you think I would come to you if I were with a woman?”

“I think so, yes.” I take a sip of the coffee, enjoying the strong flavor, a perfect measure for that damn hangover….

Then I’m startled to notice that Julian is suddenly too close, his arms on the couch, around my shoulders, murmuring next to my ear, “What a cocky girl…”

A shiver goes up my spine, raising my skin.

“Go get ready. We need to get to work.” He says in a husky voice, “And no, I’m not giving you the day off because you’re hungover.”

I grumble and drink all my coffee in a single gulp, getting up quickly to disentangle myself from his proximity….

What is this feeling... this little chill in my belly? Being around him is making it grow stronger.

“I’m leaving!” I say and leave the apartment quickly because staying inside is really toxic to my heart.

In the empty hallway, I finally inflate my lungs to their max, letting go in the next moment. And with small steps, I’m soon in front of my own apartment door... Because, of course, it’s not enough that Julian is my father’s best friend and my boss — he’s also our neighbor.

As I’m finally inside my home, I realize that I don’t have my phone with me. A growing sense of desperation takes over my chest... But when my eyes go to the couch, I see my purse lying on it — it’s the handbag I had with me last night, I’m sure.

I walk uncertainly over to the couch and pick up the phone that was, in fact, inside it. My head hurts, and the memories floods back… I remember that Julian tried to leave me at home, but when he opened the apartment and pulled me inside, I clung to him and asked him to take me to his place-

*Gosh.*

My cheeks burn, and I know I’m red.

I put my hands on his shirt and felt his warmth, and now I remember how he held me by my waist. His grip was so firm, strong… Just thinking about it makes a shiver run through my body.

Hah, I really shouldn’t have these reactions to my father’s best friend, but… He’s so hot…

Suddenly, more memories come. I remember leaning over his neck to inhale the scent of his masculine cologne and… Oh, no… I licked Julian’s neck!

A grunt escapes the back of my throat, and I close my eyes tightly, bringing my hands to my head — ANGELEE, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

I quickly walk to the bathroom and lock myself inside, leaning against the door. I’m so damn ashamed right now.

Taking a deep breath, I try to forget that disaster… But then, I look at my pitiful reflection in the mirror, and *great,* I look like a real mess. It’s better to take a shower.

As I slowly unbutton his shirt, more memories of my drunk side return... And when I fully open it, I can’t help but hold my breath.

From the reflection, I can see that my plan was really to please Eric, as I’ve chosen my best sexy lingerie. The lacy white bra is so thin and transparent that the nipples can be seen through it, and the panties also reveal much of my pelvis, hiding just my clit like a gift to be unwrapped.

I suppress a giggle, imagining Julian’s reaction to seeing me in this…

Somehow, this idea excites me, bringing a tickle to my belly and making my entrance slightly wet.
