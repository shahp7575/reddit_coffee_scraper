1mr5rjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mr5rjv/evaluate_the_best_coffee_machine_xbloom_studio/,Evaluate the Best Coffee Machine xBloom Studio and Is It Worth It,"I’ve been experimenting with the xBloom FW-02A-01 for a while now, and let me just say, it has been a journey. This coffee machine promises to revolutionize your mornings with its sleek design, impressive array of features, and the ability to make you feel like a professional barista in your own kitchen. As someone who takes coffee seriously—borderline obsessively—I had high expectations for this gadget. I’m happy to report that most of them were met, although there are a few things to note. Let’s dive in.

**Stylish Minimalist Design**  
The xBloom Studio doesn’t just make coffee; it does so while looking incredible on my countertop. The minimalist style in its midnight black finish and sleek geometric lines almost makes it a statement piece for the kitchen. Its compact size—measuring 8 inches deep, 6.7 inches wide, and 14.75 inches tall—ensures it doesn’t dominate the space. I never felt like it was cumbersome or in the way. Plus, weighing 11.3 pounds, it’s sturdy yet portable enough to shift around if I need to rearrange. The matte surface gives it an elegant finish, though it does tend to attract fingerprints occasionally, which I find a bit annoying to clean. Not a dealbreaker, but something worth mentioning.  

**Tech-Packed Brewing Options**  
This coffee maker brings technology to the forefront with its multiple brewing modes. You have three automation levels: Autopilot, Copilot, and Freesolo. Each mode is designed to suit different coffee brewing styles and skill levels. I found myself gravitating toward Autopilot on rushed mornings, as it does all the work for you. Copilot lets you step in for a bit more control, while Freesolo fully unleashes your inner barista, offering complete customization from grinding to brewing. If you’ve ever wanted to perfect a latte or a mocha, this machine makes it possible. And yes, there’s an app! The xBloom app lets you create and save your recipes while also sharing them with others. It felt a bit gimmicky at first, but as I started experimenting, being able to tweak grind size and water temperature at the tap of a screen actually became a game-changer.

**Highlights**  
- Intuitive user interface with tactile knobs and an LED matrix for precise control.  
- App functionality to save, adjust, and share custom coffee recipes.  
- Fully automatic operation, which simplifies the process when you’re in a hurry.  
- Compact size and aesthetic design to fit modern kitchen spaces.

**Eco-Friendly Features with Innovative xPods**  
One thing that stands out about this product is its sustainability focus. The xPods are not your average coffee pods; they’re compostable, containing whole coffee beans and a biodegradable filter. Even better, there’s no unnecessary packaging waste. All you have to do is scan the recipe card with the machine, dump the beans into the grinder, position the pod onto the dock, and press start. Voila, a perfect brew emerges! The machine reads from the xPod card, automating the grind size, water temperature, and brew time for optimal perfection. I genuinely appreciated how easy it made things while keeping the cleanup minimal. However, sourcing these xPods wasn’t as convenient as I’d hoped since they’re proprietary, and you can’t just walk into a store to grab replacements.

**Flaws**  
- Fingerprints and smudges on the matte finish can occasionally detract from its aesthetic appeal.  
- Proprietary xPods mean you’re locked into the brand, which limits flexibility.  
- At times, the app’s connection was a bit finicky and took a few retries to sync.  

**Competing Products**  
I couldn’t help but compare the xBloom Studio to other coffee machines like the Breville Precision Brewer and the Technivorm Moccamaster. Unlike the xBloom, these alternatives don’t have integrated grinders or app-controlled functionalities, but they do shine in terms of manual control and build quality. The Moccamaster, for instance, has a solid reputation for consistent brewing temperatures but lacks the automation and recipe-sharing capabilities that the xBloom offers. On the other hand, Breville models often offer more flexibility with generic coffee grounds and don’t tie you down to proprietary pods, which could be a major factor depending on your habits.  

It’s clear the xBloom Studio thrives on innovation and tech-forward designs, but if your focus is longevity and compatibility outside a specific ecosystem, some of its competitors might catch your eye.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Being a gadget with so many moving parts—integrated grinder, app control, automation modes—one might wonder if this machine justifies its price tag. I mulled over this too before purchasing. There’s no denying that its unique features like the wireless app interface, automated recipe creation, and Freesolo brewing justify the cost. Of course, budget-friendly buyers might feel a bit intimidated initially, but for coffee enthusiasts or anyone intrigued by tech-fueled customization, it feels like a worthwhile splurge. However, requiring specific xPods does make the ongoing running cost a concern. Ultimately, the xBloom Studio straddles an interesting line between functionality and extravagance, making it ideal if you deeply value the convenience and artistry of coffee-making.

Hey everyone!

Does anyone else have that moment lately where you stop and realize we’re actually living in the sci-fi world we once dreamed of? The rise of AI automation is turning everyday tasks into opportunities for creativity and efficiency. From smart apps to assistants that learn your quirks, it feels like we’ve hit the acceleration button on productivity—and I couldn’t be more thrilled!

Let’s talk about what makes this moment so electrifying:

- Automated reminders keep us on track (so we finally remember birthdays!).
- Generative AI tools turn our scribbles into art and our notes into polished reports.
- Smart home devices take on the chores we dreaded—thank you, AI!

But here’s the real magic: automation isn’t about replacing what we do, it’s about freeing us up to invent and play more. Just think…

• AI-powered code completion lets devs write more, debug less.

• Entrepreneurs can bootstrap businesses overnight with automated workflows.

• Creatives have more time to focus on bold ideas because tasks like scheduling and file sorting just *happen*.

Imagine waking up to find your emails are already sorted, your social posts scheduled, and your breakfast ordered—before you’ve even had your coffee!

And it only gets better. With each update, these systems get smarter by learning our preferences. Customization is no longer a wishlist item; it’s just how things work now.

Of course, there are challenges. New automation tools make us rethink jobs and the nature of work itself. But if we lean into reskilling and imagination, so many fresh doors open! There’s more time for relationships, passion projects, and actual *living*.

I’m honestly so excited to see how far we’ll go.

What’s one thing you’ve automated this year that sparked joy or saved you TONS of time? Or, what’s your wish-list “sci-fi” automation you hope is coming soon?

Let’s celebrate the small wins and dream up the next big leap! 🚀

1mr5lro,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1mr5lro/explore_best_coffee_machines_with_cuisinart/,Explore Best Coffee Machines with Cuisinart DCC-1500TG Review Worth Reading,"Brewing coffee has always been a daily ritual for me, and the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG has been my recent partner in crime for the perfect cup of morning fuel. As someone who prefers a machine that blends convenience, style, and functionality, I was curious to see if this 12-cup programmable coffeemaker could live up to its hype. While it pleasantly surprised me with its features, it also got me thinking about areas where Cuisinart could step up its game.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek black finish and modern curved design of this coffeemaker were the first things that drew me toward it. Its compact size, measuring 7.75"" deep, 10.5"" wide, and 14.5"" high, fits neatly on my kitchen counter without being intrusive. I appreciated the ergonomic glass carafe, which feels solid yet lightweight in hand, and the warming plate that pairs perfectly with it. However, the plastic elements of the machine don't feel as premium as the rest of the appliance, particularly the lid of the water reservoir, which could use a sturdier design.

**Performance Features**  
One standout feature is the 24-hour programmable function, which allows me to set it the night before and wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Truly a lifesaver on busy mornings! The LCD clock is intuitive to use, and the Brew Pause feature, which lets you sneak a cup mid-brew, might just be my favorite thing ever. It’s perfect for someone like me who doesn’t always have the patience for the full brewing cycle.

[Check Cuisinart DCC-1500TG price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0947bfpdx/)

**Coffee Quality and Taste**  
What’s a coffee machine without excellent taste? I found that this device delivers rich, hot coffee every time. Using ground coffee and the included permanent nylon filter, there’s no need to fuss over disposable filters—a definite win environmentally. The charcoal water filter stood out to me because it noticeably improved the water quality, ensuring no odd flavors sneaked into my cup. The warming plate keeps the coffee hot for up to two hours, but I did notice that after a while, it slightly affects the flavor, which I’d attribute to prolonged heating rather than the machine itself.

**Ease of Maintenance**  
Cleaning this machine is simple and user-friendly. The automated descaling function, paired with an LED clean indicator, takes the guesswork out of when maintenance is needed. It’s great for someone forgetful like me, though I did find that taking apart the carafe lid for cleaning wasn’t entirely seamless. The nylon coffee filter is durable, but it requires a good rinse after each use to avoid residue build-up.

**Advantages**  
• Intuitive 24-hour programmable feature  
• Brew Pause for those in a rush or craving a mid-brew cup  
• Permanent nylon coffee filter—eco-friendly and reusable  
• Dedicated clean mode with automatic alerts  
• Charcoal water filter for enhanced coffee flavor  

**Areas of Concern**  
• Plastic components feel less durable than expected  
• The warming plate can alter the coffee’s flavor over time  
• Carafe lid requires extra effort to clean thoroughly  

**Competing Products**  
While the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG impressed me, there’s no shortage of alternatives in its price range. One contender I’ve tried is the Braun BrewSense KF7070, which has a similarly good design and pre-programming options. The Braun does offer a sleeker LCD and stainless-steel body, which feels sturdier, but it lacks a reusable filter, requiring disposable paper ones instead. Keurig’s K-Classic is another competitor, particularly if single-serve brewing is a priority. However, the Keurig falls behind in brew strength customization, making Cuisinart’s offering more suitable for those who prefer full control over their coffee. While some competitors shine brightly in niche features, none quite match the balance of simplicity and utility offered by the Cuisinart.

**Smart Spending**  
Given the robust features packed into this coffeemaker, I consider it a solid middle-ground option for coffee lovers seeking convenience without splurging. While it’s not the cheapest option out there, the features—like the Brew Pause, programmable settings, and clean mode—justify the investment.

I'm looking for a little advice and perspective. I had a great meeting with a girl, as we spent a long time together in the afternoon and really hit it off.

For our second date, she suggested we just grab a quick coffee in the evening. I think it's because she's flying out for a long trip the next day. I don't have a ton of dating experience, and a quick coffee feels pretty brief compared to our first meeting.

I'm wondering if a short, casual second date like this is a good sign that she's making time for me even with a busy schedule?

1mr5kj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mr5kj2/the_cruel_prince_holly_black_novel_read_free/,The Cruel Prince Holly Black Novel  Read Free online:,"1.When I was nine, one of Madoc’s guards bit off the very top of the ring finger on my left hand. We were outside, and when I screamed, he pushed me hard enough that my head smacked into a wooden post in the stables. Then he made me stand there while he chewed the piece he’d bitten off. He told me exactly how much he hated mortals. I bled so much—you wouldn’t think that much blood could come out of a finger. When it was over, he explained that I better keep what happened secret, because if I didn’t, he’d eat the rest of me. So, obviously, I didn’t tell anyone. Until now, when I am telling you.  
  
  2.When I was eleven, I was spotted hiding under  
the banquet table at one of the revels by a particularly bored member of the Gentry. He dragged me out by one foot, kicking and squirming. I don’t think he knew who I was—at least, I tell myself he didn’t. But he compelled me to drink, and so I drank; the grass-green faerie wine slipping down my throat like nectar. He danced me around the hill. It was fun at first, the kind of terrifying fun that makes you screech to be put down half the time and feel dizzy and sick the rest. But when the fun wore off and I still couldn’t stop, it was just terrifying. It turned out that my fear was equally amusing to him, though. Princess Elowyn found me at the end of the revel, puking and crying. She didn’t ask me a single thing about how I got that way, she just handed me over to Oriana like I was a misplaced jacket. We never told Madoc about it. What would have been the point? Everyone who saw me probably thought I was having a grand old time.  
  
  3.When I was fourteen and Oak was four, he glamoured me. He didn’t mean to—well, at least he didn’t really understand why he shouldn’t. I wasn’t wearing any protective charms because I’d just come out of a bath. Oak didn’t want to go to bed. He told me to play dolls with him, so we played. He commanded me to chase him, so we played chase through the halls. Then he figured out he could make me slap myself, which was very funny. Tatterfell came upon us hours later, took a good look at my reddened cheeks and the tears in my eyes, and then ran for Oriana. For weeks, a giggling Oak tried to glamour me into getting him sweets or lifting him above my head or spitting at the dinner table. Even though it never worked, even though I wore a strand of rowan berries everywhere after that, it was all I could do for months not to strike him to the floor. Oriana has never forgiven me for that restraint—she believes my not revenging myself on him then means I plan to revenge myself in the future.

Here’s why I don’t like these stories: They highlight that I am vulnerable. No matter how careful I am, eventually I’ll make another misstep. I am weak. I am fragile. I am mortal.  
  
  I hate that most of all.  
  
  Even if, by some miracle, I could be better than them, I will never be one of them.  
  
  They don’t wait long to retaliate.  
  
  For the rest of the afternoon and early evening, we receive lessons in history. A cat-headed goblin named Yarrow recites ballads and asks us questions. The more correct answers I give, the angrier Cardan grows. He makes no secret of his displeasure, drawling to Locke about how boring these lessons are and sneering at the lecturer.  
  
  For once, we’re done before dark has fully fallen. Taryn and I start for home, with her giving me concerned glances. The light of sunset filters through the trees, and I take a deep breath, drinking in the scent of pine needles. I feel a kind of weird calm, despite the stupidity of what I’ve done.  
  
  “This isn’t like you,” Taryn says finally. “You don’t pick fights with people.”  
  
  “Appeasing them won’t help.” I toe a stone with a slipper-covered foot. “The more they get away with, the more they believe they’re entitled to have.”  
  
  “So you’re going to, what—teach them manners?” Taryn sighs. “Even if someone should do it, that someone doesn’t have to be you.”  
  
  She’s right. I know she’s right. The giddy fury of this afternoon will fade, and I will regret what I’ve done. Probably after a good, long sleep, I’ll be as horrified as Taryn is. All I have bought myself is worse problems, no matter how good it felt to salve my pride.  
  
  You’re no killer.  
  
  What you lack is nothing to do with experience.  
  
  And yet, I don’t regret it now. Having stepped off the edge, what I want to do is fall.  
  
  I begin to speak when a hand claps down over my mouth. Fingers sink into the skin around my lips. I strike out, swinging my body around, and see Locke grabbing Taryn’s waist. Someone has my wrists. I wrench my mouth free and scream, but screams in Faerie are like birdsong, too common to attract much attention.  
  
  They push us through the woods, laughing. I hear a whoop from one of the boys. I think I hear Locke say something about larks being over quickly, but it’s swallowed up in the merriment.  
  
  Then a shove at my shoulders and the horrible shock of cold water closing over me. I sputter, trying to breathe. I taste mud and reeds. I shove myself up. Taryn and I are waist-high in the river, the current pushing us downstream toward a deeper, rougher part. I dig my feet into the muck at the bottom to keep from being swept away. Taryn is gripping a boulder, her hair wet. She must have slipped.  
  
  “There are nixies in this river,” Valerian says. “If you don’t get out before they find you, they’ll pull you under and hold you there. Their sharp teeth will sink into your skin.” He mimes taking a bite.  
  
  They’re all along the riverbank, Cardan closest, Valerian beside him. Locke brushes his hand over the tops of cattails and bulrushes, looking abstracted. He does not seem kind now. He seems bored with his friends and with us, too.  
  
  “Nixies can’t help what they are,” Nicasia says, kicking the water so that it splashes my face. “Just like you won’t be able to help drowning.”  
  
  I dig my feet deeper into the mud. The water filling my boots makes it hard to move my legs, but the mud locks them in place when I manage to stand still. I don’t know how I am going to get to Taryn without slipping.  
  
  Valerian is emptying our schoolbags onto the riverbank. He and Nicasia and Locke take turns hurling the contents into the water. My leather-bound notebooks. Rolls of paper that disintegrate as they sink. The books of ballads and histories make an enormous splash, then lodge between two stones and will not budge. My fine pen and nibs shimmer along the bottom. My inkpot shatters on the rocks, turning the river vermilion.  
  
  Cardan watches me. Although he doesn’t lift a finger, I know this is all his doing. In his eyes, I see all the vast alienness of Faerie.  
  
  “Is this fun?” I call to the shore. I am so furious that there’s no room for being scared. “Are you enjoying yourselves?”  
  
  “Enormously,” says Cardan. Then his gaze slides from me to where shadows rest under the water. Are those nixies? I cannot tell. I just keep moving toward Taryn.  
  
  “This is just a game,” Nicasia says. “But sometimes we play too hard with our toys. And then they break.”  
  
  “It’s not like we drowned you ourselves,” Valerian calls.  
  
  My foot slips on slick rocks, and I am under, swept downstream helplessly, gulping muddy water. I panic, snorting into my lungs. I thrust out a hand, and it closes on the root of a tree. I get my balance again, gasping and coughing.  
  
  Nicasia and Valerian are laughing. Locke’s expression is unreadable. Cardan has one foot in the reeds, as though to get a better look. Furious and sputtering, I push my way back to Taryn, who comes forward to grab my hand and squeeze it hard.  
  
  “I thought you were going to drown,” she says, the edge of hysteria in her voice.  
  
  “We’re fine,” I tell her. Digging my feet into the murk, I reach down for a rock. I find a large one and heft it up, green and slick with algae. “If the nixies come at us, I’ll hold them off.”  
  
  “Quit,” Cardan says. He’s looking directly at me. He does not even spare a glance for Taryn. “You should never have been tutored with us. Abandon thoughts of the tourney. Tell Madoc you don’t belong with us, your betters. Do that and I’ll save you.”  
  
  I stare at him.  
  
  “All you have to do is give in,” he says. “Easy.”  
  
  I look over at my sister. It’s my fault she’s wet and scared. The river is cold, despite the heat of summer, the current strong. “And you’ll save Taryn, too?”  
  
  “Oh, so you’ll do what I say for her sake?” Cardan’s gaze is hungry, devouring. “Does that feel noble?” He pauses, and in that silence, all I hear is Taryn’s hitched breath. “Well, does it?”  
  
  I look at the nixies, watch them for any sign of movement. “Why don’t you tell me how you want me to feel?”  
  
  “Interesting.” He takes another step closer, squatting and regarding us from eye level. “There are so few children in Faerie that I’ve never seen one of us twinned. Is it like being doubled or more like being divided in half?”  
  
  I don’t answer.  
  
  Behind him, I see Nicasia thread her arm through Locke’s and whisper something to him. He gives her a scathing look, and she pouts. Maybe they’re annoyed that we’re not currently being eaten.  
  
  Cardan frowns. “Twin sister,” he says, turning to Taryn. A smile returns to his mouth, as though a terrible new idea has come to delight him. “Would you make a similar sacrifice? Let’s find out. I have a most generous offer for you. Climb up the bank and kiss me on both my cheeks. Once that’s done, so long as you don’t defend your sister by word or deed, I won’t hold you accountable for her defiance. Now, isn’t that a good bargain? But you get it only if you come to us now and leave her there to drown. Show her that she will always be alone.”  
  
  For a moment, Taryn stands still, as if frozen.  
  
  “Go,” I say. “I’ll be fine.”  
  
  It still hurts when she wades toward the bank. But of course she should go. She will be safe, and the price is nothing that matters.  
  
  One of the pale shapes detaches from the others and swims toward her, but my shadow in the water makes it hesitate. I mime throwing the rock, and it jolts a little. They like easy prey.  
  
  Valerian takes Taryn’s hand and helps her out of the water as if she were a great lady. Her dress is soaked, dripping as she moves, like the dresses of water sprites or sea nymphs. She presses her bluish lips to Cardan’s cheeks, one and then the other. She keeps her eyes closed, but his are open, watching me.  
  
  “Say ‘I forsake my sister Jude,’” Nicasia tells her. “‘I won’t help her. I don’t even like her.’”  
  
  Taryn looks in my direction, quick and apologetic. “I don’t have to say that.  
That wasn’t part of the bargain.” The others laugh.  
  
  Cardan’s boot parts the thistles and bulrushes. Locke starts to speak, but Cardan cuts him off. “Your sister abandoned you. See what we can do with a few words? And everything can get so much worse. We can enchant you to run around on all fours, barking like a dog. We can curse you to wither away for want of a song you’ll never hear again or a kind word from my lips. We’re not mortal. We will break you. You’re a fragile little thing; we’d hardly need to try. Give up.”  
  
  “Never,” I say.  
  
  He smiles, smug. “Never? Never is like forever—too big for mortals to comprehend.”  
  
  The shape in the water remains where it is, probably because the presence of Cardan and the others makes it seem like I have friends who might defend me if I were attacked. I wait for Cardan’s next move, watching him carefully. I hope I look defiant. He scrutinizes me for a long, awful moment.  
  
  “Think on us,” he says to me. “All through your long, sodden, shameful walk home. Think on your answer. This is the least of what we can do.” With that, he turns away from us, and after a moment, the others turn, too. I watch him go. I watch them all go.  
  
  When they’re out of sight, I pull myself onto the bank, flopping onto my back in the mud next to where Taryn is standing. I take big, gulping breaths of air. The nixies begin to surface, looking at us with hungry, opalescent eyes. They peer at us through a patch of foxtails. One begins to crawl onto land.  
  
  I throw my rock. It doesn’t come close to hitting, but the splash startles them into not coming closer.  
  
  Grunting, I force myself up to begin walking. And all through our walk home, while Taryn makes soft, sobbing sounds, I think about how much I hate them and how much I hate myself. And then I don’t think about anything but lifting my wet boots, one step after another carrying me past the briars and fiddleheads and elms, past bushes of red-lipped cherries, barberries and damsons, past the wood sprites who nest in the rosebushes, home to a bath and a bed in a world that isn’t mine and might never be.  
  
  My head is pounding when Vivienne shakes me awake. She jumps up onto the bed, kicking off the coverlets and making the frame groan. I press a cushion over my face and curl up on my side, trying to ignore her and go back to dreamless slumber.  
  
  “Get up, sleepyhead,” she says, pulling back my blankets. “We’re going to the mall.”  
  
  I make a strangled noise and wave her away.  
  
  “Up!” she commands, leaping again.  
  
  “No,” I moan, burrowing deeper in what’s left of the blankets. “I’ve got to rehearse for the tournament.”  
  
  Vivi stops bouncing, and I realize that it’s no longer true. I don’t have to fight. Except that I foolishly told Cardan I would never quit.  
  
  Which makes me remember the river and the nixies and Taryn.  
  
  How she was right, and I was magnificently, extravagantly wrong.  
  
  “I’ll buy you coffee when we get there, coffee with chocolate and whipped cream.” Vivi is relentless. “Come on. Taryn’s waiting.”  
  
  I half-stumble out of bed. Standing, I scratch my hip and glare. She gives me her most charming smile, and I find my annoyance fading, despite myself. Vivi is often selfish, but she’s so cheerful about it and so encouraging of cheerful selfishness in others that it’s easy to have fun with her.  
  
  I dress quickly in the modern clothes I keep in the very back of my wardrobe—jeans, an old gray sweater with a black star on it, and a pair of glittery silver Converse high-tops. I pull my hair into a slouchy knitted hat, and when I catch a glimpse of myself in the full-length mirror (carved so that it seems like a pair of bawdy fauns are on either side of the glass, leering), a different person is looking back at me.  
  
  Maybe the person I might have been if I’d been raised human.  
  
  Whoever that is.  
  
  When we were little, we used to talk about getting back to the human world all the time. Vivi kept saying that if she learned just a little more magic, we’d be able to go. We were going to find an abandoned mansion, and she was going to enchant birds to take care of us. They would buy us pizza and candy, and we would go to school only if we felt like it.  
  
  By the time Vivi learned how to travel there, though, reality had intruded on our plans. It turns out birds can’t really buy pizza, even if they’re enchanted.  
  
  I meet my sisters in front of Madoc’s stables, where silver-shod faerie horses are penned up beside enormous toads ready to be saddled and bridled and reindeer with broad antlers hung with bells. Vivi is wearing black jeans and a white shirt, mirrored sunglasses hiding her cat eyes. Taryn has on pink jeggings, a fuzzy cardigan, and a pair of ankle boots.  
  
  We try to imitate girls we see in the human world, girls in magazines, girls we see on movie screens in air-conditioned theaters, eating candy so sweet it makes my teeth ache. I don’t know what people think when they look at us. These clothes are a costume for me. I am playing dress-up in ignorance. I no more can guess the assumptions that go along with glittering sneakers than a child in a dragon costume knows what real dragons would make of the color of her scales.  
  
  Vivi picks stalks of ragwort that grow near the water troughs. After finding three that meet her specifications, she lifts the first and blows on it, saying, “Steed, rise and bear us where I command.”  
  
  With those words, she tosses the stalk to the ground, and it becomes a raw-boned yellow pony with emerald eyes and a mane that resembles lacy foliage. It makes an odd keening neigh. She throws down two more stalks, and moments later three ragwort ponies snort the air and snuffle at the ground. They look a little like sea horses and will ride over land and sky, according to Vivi’s command, keeping their seeming for hours before collapsing back into weeds.  
  
  It turns out that passing between Faerie and the mortal world isn’t all that difficult. Faerie exists beside and below mortal towns, in the shadows of mortal cities, and at their rotten, derelict, worm-eaten centers. Faeries live in hills and valleys and barrows, in alleys and abandoned mortal buildings. Vivi isn’t the only faerie from our islands to sneak across the sea and into the human world with some regularity, although most don mortal guises to mess with people. Less than a month ago, Valerian was bragging about campers he and his friends had tricked into feasting with them, gorging on rotten leaves enchanted to look like delicacies.  
  
  I climb onto my ragwort steed and wrap my hands around the creature’s neck. There is always a moment when it begins to move that I can’t help grinning. There is something about the sheer impossibility of it, the magnificence of the woods streaking by and the way the ragwort hooves kick up gravel as they leap up into the air, that gives me an electric rush of pure adrenaline.  
  
  I swallow the howl clawing up my throat.  
  
  We ride over the cliffs and then the sea, watching mermaids leap in the spangled waves and selkies rolling along the surf. Past the fog perpetually surrounding the islands and concealing them from mortals. And then on to the shoreline, past Two Lights State Park, a golf course, and a jetport. We touch down in a small tree-covered patch across the road from the Maine Mall. Vivi’s shirt flutters in the wind as she lands. Taryn and I dismount. With a few words from Vivi, the ragwort steeds become just three half-wilted weeds among others.  
  
  “Remember where we parked,” Taryn says with a grin, and we start toward the mall.  
  
  Vivi loves this place. She loves to drink mango smoothies, try on hats, and buy whatever we want with acorns she enchants to pass as money. Taryn doesn’t love it the way Vivi does, but she has fun. When I am here, though, I feel like a ghost.  
  
  We strut through the JCPenney as though we’re the most dangerous things around. But when I see human families all together, especially families with sticky-mouthed, giggling little sisters, I don’t like the way I feel.  
  
  Angry.  
  
  I don’t imagine myself back in a life like theirs; what I imagine is going over there and scaring them until they cry.  
  
  I would never, of course.  
  
  I mean, I don’t think I would.  
  
\>   Taryn seems to notice the way my gaze snags on a child whining to her mother. Unlike me, Taryn is adaptable. She knows the right things to say. She’d be okay if she were thrust back into this world. She’s okay now. She will fall in love, just as she said. She will metamorphose into a wife or consort and raise faerie children who will adore and outlive her. The only thing holding her back is me.  
  
  I am so glad she can’t guess my thoughts.  
  
  “So,” Vivi says. “We’re here because you both could use some cheering up. So cheer up.”  
  
  I look over at Taryn and take a deep breath, ready to apologize. I don’t know if that’s what Vivi had in mind, but it’s what I’ve known I had to do since I got out of bed. “I’m sorry,” I blurt out.  
  
  “You’re probably mad,” Taryn says at the same time.  
  
  “At you?” I am astonished.  
  
  Taryn droops. “I swore to Cardan that I wouldn’t help you, even though I came with you that day to help.”  
  
  I shake my head vehemently. “Really, Taryn, you’re the one who should be angry that I got you tossed into the water in the first place. Getting yourself out of there was the smart thing to do. I would never be mad about that.”  
  
  “Oh,” she says. “Okay.”  
  
  “Taryn told me about the prank you played on the prince,” Vivi says. I see myself reflected in her sunglasses, doubled, quadrupled with Taryn beside me. “Pretty good, but now you’re going to have to do something much worse. I’ve got ideas.”  
  
  “No!” Taryn says with vehemence. “Jude doesn’t need to do anything. She was just upset about Madoc and the tournament. If she goes back to ignoring them, they’ll go back to ignoring her, too. Maybe not at first, but eventually.”  
  
  I bite my lip because I don’t think that’s true.  
  
  “Forget Madoc. Knighthood would have been boring anyway,” Vivi says, effectively dismissing the thing I’ve been working toward for years. I sigh. It’s annoying, but also reassuring that she doesn’t think it’s that big a deal, when the loss has felt overwhelming to me.  
  
  “So what do you want to do?” I ask Vivi to avoid any more of this discussion. “Are we seeing a movie? Do you want to try on lipsticks? Don’t forget you promised me coffee.”

Most of my tuition and living expenses were covered by a student loan of about $12,000. I also had around $500 in monthly living costs for rent, groceries, and other essentials. Figuring out how to manage money on my own was overwhelming at first. I was worried about paying bills late, mismanaging my credit card, or hurting my credit score without even realizing it.

I started small. I got my first credit card with a $1,000 limit and used it for regular purchases like groceries ($50–$100/month) and coffee ($15–$20/week). I always paid it off in full each month. I also made sure my $150 monthly student loan payment was on time.

Tracking my spending helped a lot. I realised I was spending about $600/month initially, which was still tight compared to my income from a part-time campus job ($700/month). I had to cut back on coffee runs, cook more at home, and share utilities with roommates to to get on track. Over a few months, I started seeing my credit score improve from 620 to 650, then gradually to 690 by the end of the year.

I also kept a simple spreadsheet to track all my payments and due dates. Checking my progress regularly helped me feel in control and understand how each action affected my credit. By the time I applied for a small personal loan to buy a used laptop, my credit history and score made approval easy.",0,1755281216.0,StudentLoans,1,0.33,False

1mr5hqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mr5hqb/the_house_that_breathes_part_3/,The House That Breathes (Part 3),"I used to think our house breathed.
When I was little, I’d fall asleep to the way the walls creaked after dark, soft, slow expansions like lungs filling with night air. I thought the sound meant the house was alive and liked us living inside it. I imagined it had a favorite spot, probably the kitchen, and that it listened to us when we talked about our day. But lately it felt different.
Not alive. Not friendly. Just… watching.
That Saturday started like any other. The air had gone crisp enough that Mom made cinnamon oatmeal and opened all the windows. She said it “cleared out the house,” but I wasn’t sure from what. She was humming again, something low and strange, like a lullaby I couldn’t place. The smell of cinnamon mixed with cold morning air. The kind of thing that should’ve made the day feel safe. But it didn’t.

Rook had spent most of the night pacing between my door and the front window. I could hear his claws tapping the floor like a metronome, back and forth, never pausing long enough to sleep.
I sat at the kitchen table with my bowl, watching him.

“Is he okay?” I asked.
“He’s just restless,” Mom said.
“Why?”
She stirred the oatmeal again even though it didn’t need it. “Dogs feel the seasons change. It throws them off sometimes.”
She smiled like that made sense. I nodded like it did too.

Later that morning, I noticed the the hallway light was flickering. That wasn’t strange in itself, bulbs went bad all the time. But it wasn’t flickering randomly. It flashed once, paused for a second, then twice quickly. Then again. I stood under it, staring up.

One. Pause. Two. Pause.
One. Pause. Two. Pause.

It stopped when I called Mom over. By the time she stepped into the hallway, the light was glowing steady like nothing had happened. I tried to show her, to explain the pattern. She looked at me with her head tilted slightly, the way she did when she wasn’t sure if I was joking or not.
“I’ll have your dad check it,” she said. “Don’t touch the switches.”

That afternoon, we went to the store for apples and canned soup. Doverlin Market was one of those tiny markets with fake wood paneling and a single radio speaker playing music overhead. The kind of place where you knew every cashier by name and most of them knew what you liked without asking. It was hot inside. Too hot for early fall, but temperature regulating is hard during the season change. The cashier froze mid-sentence while scanning Ms.Finleys milk. His eyes glazed over, like someone had paused him. He stayed that way for a good ten seconds, then blinked and laughed like nothing happened. When we were walking past the bread aisle I noticed a man by the freezer section. He was standing perfectly still, one hand on the freezer door, just staring straight ahead. I slowed down. He didn’t move. Not a blink. Not even a shift of weight. Then he said something. It wasn’t to anyone. It was just one word.
“Wake.”
No one around him reacted. The woman restocking yogurt didn’t even glance up.
I turned to Mom. “Did you hear that?”
“Hear what?”
“That man. He just said….”
When I looked back, he was walking away like nothing had happened. No frozen stance. No strange word. Just a man picking up a frozen pizza and checking the label.
Mom looked down at me, waiting.
“Nothing,” I said. “I thought I heard something.”
She gave my shoulder a little squeeze. 

When we got home, the living room looked… off.
Not messy. Not wrong, exactly. Just different.
The couch was too far from the coffee table. The rug was askew. The painting above the mantle, the one of the barn covered in snow, was missing its frame. I stood in the doorway, staring.
“Did you move stuff around?” I asked.
Mom looked up from her grocery bag, blinked once. “I was just dusting.”
“But the frame…”
“It fell,” she said. “We’ll get a new one. No bother, honey”
I wanted to ask more, but something about her voice stopped me. It wasn’t mean. Just clipped. Like there was a script she was supposed to follow and I’d caught her mid-rehearsal.

That night I tried to stay up again. Rook lay by my bed, his head on his paws, eyes fixed on the crack beneath the door. Every time I shifted, his ears flicked. I whispered to him, just to feel less alone.
“Do you see it too?”
His tail thumped once.
I wasn’t sure if that was a yes, but I liked to think so. The house was quiet, except for a low hum, not a real sound, more like something underneath the silence. The kind of thing you don’t hear so much as feel. That night, I caught my parents whispering in the living room when they didn’t think I was listening. Their voices were low.
“…he’s not sleeping.”
“…maybe it’s just a phase”
“Scratches again. This morning.”
Rook was next to me on the stairs. He didn’t growl. Just leaned into my leg gently. Like he understood everything they were saying. I climbed back into bed. I wanted answers. I wanted to stay awake and see what happened. I lay under the blanket and focused on every sound.
At first it was just the house. Pipes ticking. Wood stretching. Wind. Then the wind stopped.
Everything stopped. Sometime after midnight, I must have drifted. I dreamed of the girl. She was in the woods. Closer to my house this time. I could almost see her face, pale, soft, smooth. She raised her hand like she was about to wave… but stopped. Her fingers bent the wrong way. I woke with a gasp, I was cold. The bedroom door was open. Not wide, just a few inches. Rook was gone.

I followed the hallway down toward the living room.
The air felt thick, like breathing through a straw. The lights weren’t on. Everything was gray-blue, lit only by moonlight spilling through the kitchen window. That’s when I saw him. Rook was sitting at the back door, staring outside. The door was locked, the handle stiff, but he was pressed up against it like he wanted me to open it.
His tail wagged once when he heard me.
He turned his head and looked at me. Really looked. Like he was waiting for me to understand something. I walked closer. The night pressed in behind the glass, too dark for moonlight. I couldn’t see anything past the first tree. I raised my hand toward the lock.
“Jamie?”
I jumped.
It was Mom’s voice, soft and too close.
I turned. She was behind me, wrapped in her robe, smiling gently.
“What are you doing up?” she asked.
“Rook wanted out.”
She looked down at him, then back at me. “He’s just restless.”
She said that word again. Restless.
I looked at Rook. He wasn’t wagging anymore.
Just watching her. Then me. Then her again. I went back to bed without saying anything else.
The next morning, the door was locked. Rook was sleeping at the foot of my bed like he’d never left. His nose was wet, and his fur smelled of moss. One of us still went in the woods last night. Mom made Monday pancakes, and as she poured them on the skillet I sleepily stared at the green glowing numbers of the stove clock. The one above the stove ran slow. Always had. But now it wasn’t just behind, it flickered. Not the numbers themselves, but the little colon in the middle, the thing that’s supposed to blink every second. I caught it blinking out of rhythm. A long pause. Then a rapid flutter. Then nothing. I counted. It didn’t line up with seconds or Morse code. It just… blinked like it was a heart beat.
“Mom,” I asked while she plated my breakfast, “why does the clock do that?”
She glanced up, then down at the food again. “Do what?”
“Blink like that.” She didn’t answer. Her fingers moved faster. Too fast. Sliced the toast into triangles with one fluid motion like she’d rehearsed it. She handed me the plate and quipped “You’re just tired.” 
Things have just gotten too weird, and I need to know if I’m crazy, because I feel crazy. I asked mom “hey, remember when we visited the lake last summer?” Her fork paused in midair.
“The lake?” she said, like I’d spoken another language.
“Yeah. The one with the swing in the big pine tree? You and Dad…”
Her smile snapped back into place. “Oh, of course. Silly me. That was a fun day.”
But I remembered the water. The way she let out that bloodcurdling scream. The ambulance lights. The smell of lightning and Pennie’s.
 I remembered that I hadn’t gone swimming in that lake, I had fallen. I had died, and luckily was brought back, that’s why we don’t visit the lake anymore.

1mr5g89,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mr5g89/seaside_coffins_part_2_of_2/,Seaside Coffins (Part 2 of 2),"I kissed my wife goodbye that morning, my hand lingering on the bump of her belly where my unborn child grew. What I did, I did for them. I drove my car to the nearest psychiatric hospital. St. Agatha’s. I had a few family members admit themselves to this place when I was a kid. Maybe this was some kind of family curse, I pondered.

I checked myself in, told them I was possibly a danger to myself and others. They sat me in a wheelchair and wheeled me to a room where they told me a doctor would be in to see me soon. The walls were covered in pictures with mental health advice. Coping techniques, cliché phrases and platitudes. I sniffed as I caught a whiff of cigar smoke. I whirled around, scanning the room for the specter of Nat Blackwood, but he was nowhere to be seen.

I turned back just in time to see the door swing open. A woman in a lab coat, mid 40’s, slightly graying shoulder length blonde hair, and lines starting to form on her face. Her nametag read, “Doc. Tabla Know MD”

“Good morning, Mr. Southern. What’s been troubling you?” She sat down in front of her computer terminal and started typing. Entering her credentials, I thought.

“I’m not sane, doc. I’ve been seeing things, imagining people. Doing things I have no recollection of, finding collections of cigars I have no memory of acquiring. Everywhere I go, I smell that damned cigar smoke.” She looked up from her typing for a moment and down her glasses at me for a moment.

“Why don’t you tell me what this business about being a danger to yourself and others is about.” I wrung my hands nervously as I began to recount my tale.

“There’s this man, he gave me a vial of… poison or something. Wants me to kill this guy that comes into my shop with it.” She nodded along as I spoke, humming in acknowledgement.

“Tell me about your shop.” She said, typing a little more onto her screen. I couldn’t help myself. Even under duress as I was, a little pride crept its way into my voice.

“I run a business selling coffins. Premier place to get a burial receptacle, they say. Seaside Coffins.” She kept typing as I spoke.

“You make a living selling coffins, Cory. You deal with death every day, even if you don’t realize it. What difference will one death at your hands make?” The smell of the cigar smoke intensified. I looked into the doctor’s eyes as she turned to face me from her screen once more.

“What?” I asked incredulously. I couldn’t possibly have heard what I thought I did. Doctor Know produced a cigar from the breast pocket of her lab coat. She put it in her mouth and spoke around it while bringing the flame from a zippo to its end.

“Seriously, people die every day. What does it matter if one of those deaths is because of you?” She puffed madly on the cigar as the crackle of the flame intensified.

“Blackwood!” I yelled, “What is this!” The cigar smoke grew impossibly thick, swirling around the room before revealing the suited figure of Nat Blackwood where the doctor once sat.

“What happened to not breathing a word of this, Mr. Southern?” He growled, exhaling more smoke. “I thought I told you what would happen if you failed me. How would you feel if your precious June got into a car accident? If little… oh what did you want to name him? James.” A chill ripped through my body. I hadn’t even told June about my idea to name our child James. “If little James was stillborn?”

I couldn’t contain my rage. I leapt from my seat and tackled Blackwood to the ground, knocking him over backward in his chair. “You leave my family alone, you bastard!” I cried, tears streaming down my face as I wrapped my hands around his throat. He smiled, that damned manifold smile of his even as strained coughs issued from his throat. Blackwood reached for his cigar that had rolled underneath the examination table. He pressed its burning end into my eye.

I recoiled as the smell of my singed eyelashes assaulted my nose. I couldn’t open my left eye. Blackwood stood over me, his hair a mess and a wild look in his eye. The last thing I saw was the bottom of his boot before my world went black.

When I came to, I was behind the counter at Seaside Coffins. Terry was sweeping the floor by the shops front windows whistling that stupid tune of his. Oh god, I panicked. What day was it? How much time did I have to get out of here? To stop what would happen? I dug in the pocket of my slacks for my phone, but my fingers brought back a vial of swirling purple liquid instead. I let it fall to the table as I wrenched my phone free from my too-tight pocket.

April 3^(rd). The day Blackwood said the man would come. But it was only 7:30, the shop didn’t even open for another half hour. Maybe I could get out of here. Get myself arrested or something so no one would get hurt.

I checked my text messages. It was as though June and I had been carrying on our normal conversations, the cover story I told her corroborated in great detail. I had lost a week, but it was like someone had been living my life for me. Piloting my body while the lights were out upstairs.

“Terry!” I yelled over his inane whistling. He looked up from his sweeping with a start, lips still pursed around the tune. “We’re not going to open the shop today, you can take the day…” I trailed off as I saw the man stumbling past the glass windows toward the door of the shop. His shirt was half tucked in, and his tie dangled precarious and undone around his neck. His clothes were soaked with sweat. “Terry lock the door, hurry!” I couldn’t get the words out in time.

The disheveled man stumbled through the door, setting the absent bell to ringing once again. My teeth ground against each other.

“Oh god, mister, are you okay?” Terry was an idiot, but he was good natured. He let the broom fall to the floor as he fanned the sweating man, now resting on an elbow, with a catalogue of coffins from the nearby table.

“I’ll be okay,” the man choked out. “I just need a little water. There I was at the crossroads, but my soul had already been sold. The smell of cigar smoke filled the air and I knew my time to decide was short. To hell with it, I thought. I’ll do this just once and go back to my happy life and never think about Nat Blackwood again.

“Terry!” I barked, “Take him to my office where it’s cool, I’ll get him some water.”

“Yes, sir.” he said, as he helped the man to his feet. He wrapped one of his arms around him and helped him take stumbling steps down the hallway to my office.

I grabbed my coffee mug and the vial and rushed to the bathroom. I started to rinse it out but thought better of it. He was about to be dead, anyway. So what if he tastes my shitty coffee?

I filled the mug halfway full of water and uncorked the vial. The smell of hollyhock wafted into the air. I dumped the vial into the mug, the swirling purple quickly changing to match the clarity of the water as a tendrils of wispy steam wafted up from the mixture. It burbled briefly before becoming indistinguishable from ordinary water.

I held the mug in both hands as I passed the threshold of my office. Terry was there, still fanning the man as his sweat soaked into the cloth upholstery of my office chairs.

“I don’t know what to do Mr. Southern, he just keeps sweating!” Of all the days to have incompetent help, I thought.

“Go open the store,” I said. “I’ll take care of him.”

He sat the catalogue down on my desk before rushing past me with an “On it, boss.” He was so relieved to be doing something of no real consequence, typical.

“Here,” I said coldly as I pushed the mug into his hands. He took it without a word and downed its contents in a single, quick gulp. “Blackwood said you wanted to die,” I spoke calmly as his eyes followed me around my desk and into my seat behind it. “I want to know why.”

“What?” The man gasped as he lowered the empty mug from his mouth. “Who’s Blackwood?” My stomach dropped. Was this not the man I was supposed to poison?

“Nat Blackwood,” I spat nervously. “Your associate, Nathaniel Blackwood.” I was grasping at anything that would tell me I hadn’t just doomed my family.

“Listen, Mister. Thanks for the water, but I don’t know any—” His eyes rolled back in his head and he slumped into the chair, drool running out of his mouth onto his already sweat-drenched dress shirt.

“No.” I whispered softly and cradled my head in my hands. “Oh god, what have I done?” I stood from my chair slowly, never taking my eyes from the man in the chair. I put my finger in front of his nose but felt no breath. I pressed two fingers to his jugular and felt no pulse. “Fuck!” I scream-whispered in panic and bit at the knuckle of my pointer finger.

I grabbed the man under his arms and dragged him out of the chair and around my desk, then under it. I was huffing from the effort as I collapsed into my chair. The dead man’s hand tumbled from his chest onto my shoe and I kicked it away as I wiped the sweat from my brow.

Damn that Blackwood, I thought. He was no associate of yours, probably didn’t want to die either. Well, at least it was done. My family would be safe at least. My biggest problem now was the dead body in my office. The worst part, Terry knew about it. Christ, what do I do about Terry. I had another lie to tell.

I exited my office closing the door behind me, making sure to lock it. I adjusted my clothes on the way down the hall, trying to rid myself of any sign of the crime I had committed.

I found Terry behind the counter, chatting it up with a well-dressed older couple. “Oh yeah, Mr. Southern is a real virtuoso when it comes to his craft. I’ve never seen anything like the kinds of stuff he makes!” Normally the flattery would bring a smile to my face. I always liked being appreciated for my craftsmanship. Not today. “Speak of the devil,” Terry said, smiling at me as I emerged onto the shop floor.

“Hello!” I said, putting on my best customer service smile. “Are you finding everything okay?”

The man adjusted his spectacles before he spoke in a mousy voice. “We are, I was just having a chat with your man here about the quality of your coffins. They truly are a sight to behold.” He shifted his weight, uncomfortable, before continuing. “My poor mother, she’s not long for this world…” I tried my best to listen, I really did. I was always sympathetic to the sob stories that came in the door, it’s good for business. I couldn’t take my mind off the body in my office.

“I’m sorry to hear that, sir. Will you give me just one moment please?” I saw something change in the man’s eyes, but I was far too occupied with other matters to care. I leaned in to whisper to Terry. “The man in my office is going to be fine, I’ve called an EMT friend of mine and he’s on his way right now. I’m sorry you had to deal with that. Why don’t you take the rest of the day off? Paid of course.”

Terry wasted no time. He beamed at me as he lifted his apron over his head. “Thanks, boss!” Damned slacker. At least he was out of my hair. He was out the door and I turned to face my customers again.

“So sorry about that mister…” I extended my hand for an introduction but he didn’t bother shaking it.

“I think we’re going to find a coffin elsewhere. Thank you for your time, Mr. Southern, I know you’re a busy man.” With that the man wrapped an arm around his wife and walked out of my shop. I sat in the stool behind the counter and put my face in my hands. It had been one thing after another ever since Blackwood came to collect.

Damn him. What was I supposed to do with a corpse. What’s done with all corpses, I thought. You put them in a box and put that box in the ground. I locked the glass front doors and drew the shades down over the windows. I wasn’t about to put him in one of my nice coffins though, especially after this ordeal just cost me a potential sale.

I went to my workshop. I grabbed my tools and hurriedly gathered up the cheapest materials I had. It was truly a pine box. Thin pieces of plywood and 2x4s. Nailed together. I’d be ashamed if this wasn’t simply a means to an end. It was night by the time I finished sanding the damned thing. I hadn’t eaten all day. I had no idea when the last time I had eaten even was.

I went to my office. I hadn’t smoked in years, but I needed a cigarette. I saw my reflection in the black screen of the television. Disheveled was putting it lightly. I looked like I had been rolling around in a pit of sawdust, and my dress shirt was stained at the pits. It reminded me of the man who had come in my shop this morning. The same one that now lay dead under my desk.

I opened the drawer with the cigars in it from the other side, I didn’t want to see the body any more than I had to. My hand came away first with, a can of corn? I guess Blackwood wasn’t done fucking with me. I sat it down on the desk and retrieved a cigar. I lit it with a zippo I found in my pocket. I guess the bastard got me hooked on nicotine while he had control of my body. I inhaled deeply; the smoke billowed from the cherry like a smokestack. Way too much smoke. These were Blackwood’s brand alright. I felt a chill behind me and there he stood. Pressed suit, big, unnatural grin and all.

I took another drag of the cigar. “I did what you asked. Are we even now?”

Blackwood extended his hand. “Consider your debt repaid, Cory Southern. Shake on it?” His grin grew even wider. I thought the skin at the edges of his mouth might tear if he kept that up for long. I held the cigar between my teeth and grabbed his hand. It was ice cold, just like on the day we first met.

No sooner had I squeezed his hand, than he was gone. Vanished in a puff of the sickly-sweet cigar smoke. I collapsed into my chair dragging deeply from the stogie. It was going to be hell to kick this habit again, I thought. “Now, what to do with you.” I said aloud as I pushed my chair back to get a look at the body under my desk.

My blood ran cold when all I saw were stains in the carpet. Not blood, water? Sweat? Can a corpse sweat? A better question was, where the hell did the corpse go? The lights in my office began to flicker. The buzz of the fluorescent lights intensified as they flashed between bright light and total darkness.

My heart was racing when I pulled my phone out of my pocket. I caught a brief glimpse of all the missed calls and texts I had from June. There would be hell to pay later. If there was a later. I switched on the flashlight of my phone; it’s pale beam scattering the dark in only a narrow cone in front of me. I slowly pushed open the door of my office, the creak of its hinges pulling a wince out of my face. Every light in the place was on the fritz, strobing in irregular, syncopated patterns.

I stepped lightly down the hall, the sound of a storm just beginning its onslaught pelted the ceiling through the rolling of distant thunder. I scanned the workshop with my torch. The ground was still covered in sawdust from the day’s labor. Lightning crashed outside, and the shadow of a hunched figure appeared on the wall by the lackluster pine box.

“Terry?” I called out tentatively. Oh, how I wish it had been that oaf.

“Not quite.” Came a familiar voice. Unmistakably it was the voice of the sweating man who crashed through my front door this morning. It was different now, though. It was darker, tinged with a sinister resonance that evoked screeching, infernal machinery.

My light found him through the flicker. His hair was drenched. Locks clung to his forehead and his tie hung completely undone draped over his shoulders. The tail of his dress shirt no longer was tucked into his slacks, the hem wrinkled. His fingertips dripped with the rivers of sweat that ran down his arms.

“I must say, I am rather disappointed in you, Cory Southern. Blackwood told me how you longed to make the perfect coffin, and you planned to bury me in this?” He pointed an accusing finger at the hastily made coffin I had crafted.

My heart raced, my hands shook as I stammered my response. “I—I didn’t think you would mind…being dead and all.”

With another crash of lightning outside he was less than a foot in front of me. He grabbed me by the collar of my shirt with both hands, sweat stains slowly growing all across it. “Do I look dead to you?” He growled. I dropped my phone, the beam illuminated the space between, lighting up his face from below.

He didn’t look dead, he looked possessed. His eyes glowed with yellow and red spirals and his body gave off the heat of a kitchen at full blast. “No—no, sir. I’m sorry.” I could hardly speak. Every muscle in my body vibrated with fear.

With effortless strength, he threw me to the ground, straddling my abdomen and covering my mouth with one of his dripping hands. “You’re damn right you’re sorry.” He snarled, as thunder rolled outside.

The sweat seeped between my pursed lips. It tasted vaguely sweet, earthy. I realized it was hollyhock as my body stopped responding to my commands. My eyes were drawn to the spiraling vortexes of red and yellow in my assailant’s eyes and I found myself sinking deeper and deeper into a haze of delirium.

The next thing I knew, I was standing in the woods, drenched in the rain that fell in a torrent. I could see through the dark, everything outlined in white. I had a woodcutting axe in my hand and no control over my faculties whatsoever.

The possessed man spoke from behind me. “What wood makes the best coffins, Cory Southern?”

My mouth fell open and a single, half-moaned word tumbled out, “Cherry.” Whatever had me in its grasp had access to my mind and my vocal cords.

“Then, Cory Southern, my coffin will be made of cherry. Get to chopping.” My body moved of its own accord with slow sluggish movements, my shoes sinking into the mud as I made for a sturdy cherry tree.

I swung the axe with wild abandon. I felt the wood of the axe blister my hands with the friction and impact of every sting. I could not even set my teeth to endure it. With one final swing, the tree toppled to the ground with a massive thud. My body would’ve been crushed if not my taskmaster pulled me from its path just in time.

He stood me up straight and smoothed my tousled clothing. “Now then, work that magic of yours.” The black of the rain-drenched night fell away, replaced by a hypnotic psychadelia of dancing colors. The pattern from his eyes engulfed me, swirling around me like breathing irises. About my head floated the various tools of my trade, shrouded in a green glow. It was like they were suspended in an environment with no gravity.

My battered, bleeding hands wrapped around them, all too familiar. I scraped and lathed and sanded for what felt like days. My hands ached down to the bone and my blood became the varnish of the coffin as it dripped and spread evenly through the porous wood. I stood there for a long time in those swirling colors. The coffin was finished and my eyes stared at it forever. It was truly the most beautiful coffin I had ever seen, even in the dark.

Then suddenly it wasn’t dark. The sun hung directly over me in the mid-day sky and my senses returned to me along with control of my body. My tools lay sprawled haphazardly on the muddy ground and I saw the coffin in its full glory for the first time. The perfectly rounded lid shone brilliantly red in the sun. The grooves carved in the side were expertly crafted by practiced hands, my hands. It was the perfect coffin. The one I always imagined I’d be interred inside in my great glass mausoleum.

My clothes were torn and ragged, soaked with rain and blood. Several of my fingers felt broken and my palms bore deep scratches, scabbed over black. I opened the lid of the coffin with my wrists so as to not get any of my filth on this glorious creation. It was not lined with plush cushions like it would be if it was made in my workshop, but amidst the sloshing pools of sweat, the body of a disheveled man lay. Face sunken, desiccated like he had sweat all the liquid in his body and then some.

If there had been anything in my stomach, it surely would’ve lined the forest floor. There it was in the middle of this wilderness. My masterwork. My hands made it, but it was not my will that spurred their movements. Blackwood had robbed me of my life’s work. I fell to my knees sobbing. I don’t know how long I stayed there. Long enough for my stomach to remind me how long it had been since I’d eaten. I gathered my tools with trembling hands and began the long walk back to my shop.

People stared, some offered help or concern, but I ignored them all. My stumbling steps, my staggered gait, my cracked and bloody hands. They were the least of my concern. I pushed open the front door of Seaside Coffins. Terry was there behind the counter whistling that stupid tune of his again.

“Oh, hi Mr. Southern…” His voice slowed and trailed off as he saw the state of me. “My god! What happened to you?” He ran to my side, putting a hand on my shoulder. I swatted it away and stared intensely into his eyes.

“Go home, Terry.” I wanted—no, I needed to be alone.

“But boss, you’re all messed up!”

“Go. Home. Terry.” My voice was sterner now, speaking with a quiet authority that conveyed all the hatred, misery and woe that was in my heart. Terry didn’t say another word. He speedwalked out the door apron still on and I locked it behind him. I write this with a heart heavy with regret. Whether doctor, detective, policeman, hell maybe a firefighter. Whoever I give this to, please tell June Southern I’m sorry. Tell her I never meant for any of this to happen. Tell her I don’t expect her to support me in this, to even ever speak to me again. Most of all, tell her I’m sorry that James, or whatever she decides to name the child, will grow up without a father.",1,1755281029.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1mr5fxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1mr5fxp/how_i_built_my_credit_score_as_a_college_student/,How I Built My Credit Score as a College Student While Paying Off Loans,"I come from a middle-class family, and my parents worked really hard to send me to college. Most of my tuition and living expenses were covered by a student loan of about $12,000. I also had around $500 in monthly living costs for rent, groceries, and other essentials. Figuring out how to manage money on my own was overwhelming at first. I was worried about paying bills late, mismanaging my credit card, or hurting my credit score without even realizing it.

I started small. I got my first credit card with a $1,000 limit and used it for regular purchases like groceries ($50–$100/month) and coffee ($15–$20/week). I always paid it off in full each month. I also made sure my $150 monthly student loan payment was on time.

Tracking my spending helped a lot. I realised I was spending about $600/month initially, which was still tight compared to my income from a part-time campus job ($700/month). I had to cut back on coffee runs, cook more at home, and share utilities with roommates to to get on track. Over a few months, I started seeing my credit score improve from 620 to 650, then gradually to 690 by the end of the year.

I also kept a simple spreadsheet to track all my payments and due dates. Checking my progress regularly helped me feel in control and understand how each action affected my credit. By the time I applied for a small personal loan to buy a used laptop, my credit history and score made approval easy.

1mr5ea1,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1mr5ea1/should_you_choose_tide_liquid_laundry_detergent_p/,Should You Choose Tide Liquid Laundry Detergent P_15300 April Fresh Scent Review?,"I've been testing Procter & Gamble's P_15300 Tide Plus Boost of Ultra Downy Liquid Laundry Detergent for a few weeks now, and it's been a fascinating addition to my tiring laundry routine. I didn’t expect to find myself unexpectedly charmed by a laundry detergent, yet here we are. This gigantic 148 fl oz bottle is not just about size; it packs 105 loads worth of cleaning power and promises long-lasting freshness with an April Fresh scent. At first sniff, I could tell it wasn’t going to be your run-of-the-mill detergent. But, there are pros and cons worth unpacking before you grab one for your household.

**Design and User Experience**  
The design of the bottle caught my eye immediately. It’s sturdy with a well-thought-out handle that suits my oddly narrow laundry shelf. What I loved the most is the clear measuring cap. Measuring detergent has always been one of those “is this too little or too much?” moments in my laundry adventures, but this cap dispels any doubts. With easy-to-read fill lines printed on the cap, the precision made the whole laundry process feel more professional. While handling this beast of a bottle—10.69 pounds, no less—might look intimidating, pouring was surprisingly mess-free. I didn’t end up with sticky detergent residue down the sides. That’s already a small miracle.

**Key Benefits**  
- Enhanced with 20% more Downy freshness versus the previous Tide liquid detergent version.  
- Easy-pour cap simplifies accurate detergent measurement.  
- Works in all machines and efficient even in cold water settings.  

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
Let’s talk about actual laundry results because isn’t that why we’re all here? I’ve put this detergent to work on various stains: pizza grease (my office-shirt nemesis), coffee spills (how I start mornings), and even daycare-level art class disasters brought home by my niece. Its ability to tackle grease stains was solid—clothes came out looking practically new. It claims to have 2X the cleaning power compared to leading baking soda-based detergents, and after watching stains vanish, I’m inclined to believe it. That said, my love for it wasn’t entirely blind—some heavier grime on sports jerseys needed an additional spot treatment. The long-lasting freshness is real, though. A week-old shirt pulled out of the closet smelled like it had just been washed, which earned high marks from me.

**Freshness Redefined**  
If scents could win a competition, then this detergent’s April Fresh scent would be a serious contender. Instead of being overbearing like some artificial fragrances, this one is balanced. My clothes emerged with just the right floral touch—think subtle spring meadow vibes rather than a truck full of potpourri. It makes folding laundry somewhat bearable when your workspace smells delightful. Long-lasting freshness lived up to its promise: items stored for a couple of days still smelled amazing, which often didn’t happen with my past go-to detergents.

**Drawbacks**  
- Some persistent stains may require additional spot treatment.  
- At 10.69 pounds, the large bottle may be bulky for some users.  

**Competing Products**  
In a world drowning in detergents, how does this one stack up against its rivals? If I compare it to something like Arm & Hammer Plus OxiClean Liquid Laundry Detergent, the Tide formula undeniably has the upper hand on scent longevity. However, Arm & Hammer’s OxiClean-based stain-fighting edge does give it an advantage for stubborn oil and dirt. On the flip side, Tide excels at delivering consistent quality with every load, especially in cold water. Another competitor, Gain Flings, makes an appealing argument with pod convenience, but the liquid detergent here offers more load versatility and feels ideal for families tackling diverse laundry piles. Where Tide doesn’t win: packaging bulk, especially for those physically unable to handle heavy bottles.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Price and performance in the detergent game can be tricky beasts, but this product offers undeniable value for price. Its ability to pack washing power and rounded features into 105 loads surely makes it an efficient choice. The built-in Downy benefits mean you’re getting detergent and fabric softener in one, potentially saving money otherwise spent on separate purchases. Its level of freshness also saves me the need for extra dryer sheets for lingering smells. The large bottle might appear as a high upfront cost, but when calculating usages, it averages out to a friendly price-per-load ratio, especially compared to pricier pods.

I've been outta dating for a long time after my last relationship ended and I figured out I ain't partner material. Been working on embracing singledom during that time, and part of that means shutting down anything that looks like it's going romantic.

Some time ago one of my friends invited me to a gathering at his place. Recently been taking space for myself so I declined, but he was super insistent so I figured why not. While there he brought me over to this woman who I only knew from him mentioning her name as ankther friend of his and said we should be friends. It felt a lot like he was trying to set up a romantic thing and I was annoyed, but whatever, figured it wouldn't hurt to shoot the shit for a bit. It was a nice chat and she asked for my number before I left so I gave it to her. She then texted a few days later asking to grab coffee and continue the conversation. At this point i agreed to go but made very clear that this was gonna stay completely platonic because I ain't boyfriend material. She seemed to understand that.

We hung out a few more times after that and everything was fine, no complaints. But then she called me one night and said she'd like to take things to a romantic level. I told her again that I enjoy her company and she's a whole heap of fun, but that BFGF was outta the question. Again, she seemed to accept that and I figured the issue was put to bed, but then she asked again and was more insistent this time stating she really feels for me. At this point I said maybe it'd be better to take some time away from each other so she could cool her head.

Next thing my original friend who introduced us hits me up asking why I won't date her when it seems like there's a spark there. Maybe there is; she's a nice woman who's fun to hang with and I see why she'd be getting ideas in her head, but it ain't gonna end well. I fuck up every relationship I been in so far even when I do everything right, so better to not engage at all. It's created this awkward dynamic in the friend group where it feels like she and I can't be at the same parties or else there'll be that weird tension.

School. I haven’t been to school in over two years. Not unless you count sitting at the kitchen table being home-schooled by your mom, and I don’t. It’s Friday. My senior year starts on Monday, but I haven’t registered. If I don’t go in today, I won’t have a schedule on Monday morning, and I’ll have to wait at the office for one. I think I’d rather skip the bad 80’s movie scene where I walk in late on the first day and everybody has to stop what they’re doing to stare at me, because while that wouldn’t be the worst thing that would ever happen to me, it would still suck.  
  
  My aunt pulls into the parking lot of Mill Creek Community High School with me in tow. It’s a cookie cutter high school. Except for the putrid color of the walls and the name on the sign, it’s an exact replica of the last one I attended. Margot‌—‌she made me drop the aunt part because it makes her feel old‌—‌turns down the radio she’s been blaring the entire way here. Thankfully it’s a short ride, because loud sounds make me edgy. It’s not the sound itself that bothers me; it’s just the fact that it’s loud. The loud sounds make it impossible to hear the soft ones and the soft sounds are the ones you have to be afraid of. I can handle it now because we’re in a car, and I usually feel safe in cars. Outside is a different story. I never feel safe outside.  
  
  “Your mother expects a phone call when we’re done here,” Margot tells me. My mother expects a lot of things she’s never going to get. In the scheme of things, a phone call is not much to ask, but that doesn’t mean she’ll get one. “You could at least text her. Four words. Registered. All is well. If you’re feeling really generous, you could even throw one of those little happy faces on the end. ”  
  
  I look sideways at her from the passenger seat. Margot is my mother’s younger sister by a good ten years. She is the opposite of my mother in almost every way. She doesn’t even look like her which means that she doesn’t look like me, either, because I am a carbon copy of my mother. Margot is dirty blond with blue eyes and a perpetual tan that she easily maintains by working nights and napping by the pool during the day; even though she’s a nurse and she should know better. I have pale white skin, dark brown eyes, and long, wavy, just-this-side-of-black hair. She looks like she belongs in a Coppertone ad. I look like I belong in a coffin. People would have to be stupid to believe we’re related, even if it is one of the only things about me that’s true.  
  
  She’s still got that cocky smile on her face, knowing that even if she hasn’t convinced me to placate my mother, then at least she’s planted a little guilt. It’s impossible to dislike Margot, even when you really, really try, which makes me hate her a little, because I’ll never be one of those people. She took me in, not because I don’t have anywhere else to go, but because I don’t have anywhere else I can stand to be. Luckily for her, she really only has to see me in passing, because once school starts, we’ll rarely ever be home at the same time. Even so, I doubt taking in a sullen, bitter, teenage girl with more issues than National Geographic is at the center of the vision board for a single woman in her early thirties. I wouldn’t do it, but then I’m not a very good person. Maybe that’s why I ran like hell from the people who love me the most. If I could be alone, I would. Gratefully. I’d rather be alone than have to pretend I’m okay. But they won’t give me that option. So I’ll settle for being with someone who at least doesn’t love me as much. I’m thankful for Margot. Not that I tell her this. Not that I tell her anything. I don’t.  
  
  When I walk in, the main office is a mass of commotion. Phones ringing, copiers running, voices everywhere. There are three lines leading up to the front counter. I don’t know which one to get into so I pick the one closest to the door and hope for the best. Margot sweeps in behind me and immediately pulls me around the side, past all of the lines, and up to the receptionist. She’s lucky I saw her coming, or the second her hand was on my arm, she would have found herself face down on the ground with my knee in her back.  
  
  “We have an appointment with Mr. Armour, the principal,” she says authoritatively. Margot, the responsible adult. She’s playing my mom’s part today. This is a side of her I don’t usually see. She prefers the cool aunt role. She doesn’t have any kids of her own, so this is a little out of her depth. I didn’t even realize we had an appointment, but I see the sense in it now. The receptionist, a fiftyish, unpleasant-looking woman, motions us to a couple of chairs next to a closed, dark wood door.  
  
  We only have to wait a few minutes and no one notices or acknowledges me at all. The anonymity is nice. I wonder how long it will last. I look down at myself. I didn’t get decked out for the visit today. I expected to come in, fill out some paperwork, hand over some immunization records and be done with it. I wasn’t expecting the swarms of students crowding the office. I’m wearing jeans and a black v-neck t-shirt, both a little – ok, a lot – tighter than they need to be, but otherwise completely non-descript. The shoes are where I made the effort. Black stilettos. Four-and-a-half inches of insanity. I’m not using them so much for the height, even though I seriously need it, as for the effect. I wouldn’t have bothered with them today, except I needed the practice. My balance on them has gotten better, but I figured a dress rehearsal wouldn’t hurt. I’d prefer to avoid eating ass on my first day of school.  
  
  I look at the clock on the wall. The second hand is bouncing back and forth inside my head, even though I know I can’t possibly hear the ticking over everything else going on. I wish I could tune out the noise in this room. It’s disconcerting. There are too many sounds at once and my brain is trying to separate them, to sort them out into neat little piles, but it’s almost impossible with all of the machines and voices melting together. I open and close my hand in my lap and hope we get called in soon.  
  
  A few minutes that seem like an hour later, the heavy wooden door opens and we’re ushered inside by a forty-something man in an ill-fitting shirt and tie. Attire aside, he’s not a bad-looking guy. Too good-looking to be a principal. He smiles warmly before sliding back behind his desk, into an oversized leather chair. The desk is imposing. Too big for this office. Obviously the furniture is meant to intimidate, because the man does not. Even before he’s said much, I peg him as soft. I hope I’m right. I’m going to need him on this.  
  
  I settle back into one of two matching burgundy leather chairs opposite Mr. Armour’s desk. Margot sinks into the chair next to me and launches into her spiel. I listen for a few minutes as she explains my “unique situation” to him. Unique situation, indeed. As she goes into detail, I see him glance over at me. His eyes widen just slightly as he looks closer, and I catch the glimmer of recognition in them. Yes, that’s me. He remembers me. If I had gotten further away, this might not even be necessary. The name wouldn’t mean much of anything. The face would mean even less. But I’m only two hours from ground zero and if even one person puts it together, I’ll be right back where I was there. I can’t take the chance, so here we sit, in Mr. Armour’s office, three days before the start of my senior year. Nothing like last minute. Though this, at lea  
st, is not my fault. My parents fought the move until the end, but they finally relented. I may have Margot to thank for some of that. Though I think the fact that I broke my father’s heart helped the cause a little, too. And, probably, they were all just tired.  
  
  I’m completely zoned out on the conversation now, and I’m busy checking out Armour’s office. There’s not much to distract, a couple of houseplants that look like they need to be watered, along with a few family pictures. The diploma on the wall is from the University of Michigan. His first name is Alvis. Huh. What kind of crap name is Alvis? I don’t even think it means anything, but I’ll definitely check later. I’m running through possible origins in my head when I see Margot pulling out a file and handing it to him. Doctor’s notes. Lots of them. As he looks over the paperwork, my eyes are drawn to the old-school metal hand-crank pencil sharpener on his desk. It strikes me as odd. The desk is a rich, fancy cherry number, nothing like the crap industrial ones teachers get. Why anyone would mount such an ancient pencil sharpener on it is beyond me. It’s a complete contradiction. I wish I could ask about it. Instead, I focus on the ring of adjustable pencil holes and wonder idly if my pinky finger would fit into any of them. I’m contemplating how much it would hurt to sharpen it, and how much blood there might be, when I hear Mr. Armour’s tone shift.  
  
  “Not at all?” He sounds nervous.  
  
  “Not at all. ” Margot confirms. She’s got her put-on, no-nonsense demeanor in full swing.  
  
  “I see. Well, we’ll do what we can. I’ll make sure her teachers are informed before Monday. Has she filled in a class request form?” And like clockwork, we’ve gotten to the part where he’s started to talk about me like I’m not in the room. Margot hands him the form and he peruses it quickly. “I’ll get this to the guidance department so they can have a schedule drawn up by Monday morning. I can’t promise she’ll get these electives. Most classes are already full at this point. ”  
  
  “We understand. I’m sure you’ll do whatever possible. We appreciate your cooperation and, of course, your discretion,” Margot adds. It’s a warning. Go Margot. I think it’s kind of wasted on him, though. I do get the feeling he genuinely wants to help. Plus, I think I make him uncomfortable, which means he probably hopes to see as little of me as possible.  
  
  Mr. Armour walks us to the door, shaking Margot’s hand and nodding almost imperceptibly at me with a strained smile that I think might be pity, or possibly, disdain. Then, just as quickly, he looks away. He follows us back into the chaos of the front office and asks us to wait a moment while he heads down a hallway to the guidance office with my paperwork.  
  
  I look around and see that several of the same people I saw earlier are still waiting in line. I thank whatever god still believes in me for appointments. I’d rather clean the inside of a Port-O-Let with my tongue than spend another minute in this cacophony. We stand against the wall as far out of the way as we can get. There are no empty chairs now. I glance to the front of the line where a dirty-blonde Ken doll is tossing his most panty-dropping smile in the direction of Ms. Unpleasant on the other side of the counter. Ms. Unpleasant is now positively glowing in the aura of this boy’s flirtations. I don’t blame her. He’s the kind of good-looking that transforms once self-respecting females into useless puddles of dumbass. I struggle to separate out their conversation. Something about an office aide position. Aahh, lazy bastard. He cocks his head to the side and says something that makes Ms. Unpleasant laugh and shake her head in resignation. He’s won whatever it is he came here for. I watch the slight shift in his eyes. He knows it, too. I’m almost impressed. While he’s waiting, the door opens again and a psychotically cute girl walks in and scans the room until her eyes land on him.  
  
  “Drew!” she yells over the commotion and everyone turns. She seems oblivious to the attention. “I’m not going to sit in the car all day! Come on!” I check her out while she glowers at him. She’s blonde, like him, though not exactly; her hair is lighter, like she spent the whole summer in the sun. She’s attractive in the most obvious way possible, wearing a pink, well-filled out halter top and carrying an obsessively color-coordinated, pink Coach purse. He seems mildly amused by her displeasure. Must be his girlfriend. A matching set, I think. Panty-Combusting Ken comes complete with Piqued Princess Barbie: unachievable measurements, designer purse and annoyed scowl included! He holds up a finger to her to convey that he’ll just be a minute. If I were him, I’d choose a different finger. I smirk at the thought and glance up to see him smirking right back at me, his eyes alight with mischief.Behind him, Ms. Unpleasant quickly scrawls something on his form and signs the bottom. She passes it back to him, but he’s still looking at me. I point to her and raise my eyebrows at him. Aren’t you going to get what you came for? He turns and takes the form from her hands, thanks her and winks. He winks at the menopausal office lady. He’s so blatantly obvious, it’s almost inspired. Almost. She shakes her head again and shoos him toward the door. Well-played, Ken, well-played.  
  
  While I’ve been amusing myself with the office drama, Margot’s been whispering with a woman who I assume is the guidance counselor. Drew, who I desperately want to keep calling Ken, is still standing near the door, talking to a couple other guys who are waiting at the back of the line. I wonder if he’s purposely trying to piss off Barbie. It seems easily done.  
  
  “Let’s go. ” Margot re-emerges, ushering me toward the front doors.  
  
  “Excuse me!” a woman’s raised voice shrills, before we make it to the exit. Everyone in line turns in unison, watching the woman hold up a file folder in my direction. “How do you pronounce this name?”  
  
  “NAH-stee-ya,” Margot enunciates, and I inwardly cringe, acutely aware of the audience around us. “Nastya Kashnikov. It’s Russian. ” She tosses the last two words off over her shoulder, obviously pleased with herself for some reason. We head out the door with everyone’s eyes on our backs.  
  
  When we reach the car, she lets out a sigh and her demeanor noticeably shifts back to the Margot I know. “Well, that hurdle’s cleared. For now,” she adds. Then she smiles her dazzling, all-American-girl smile. “Ice cream?” she asks, sounding like she might need it more than me. I smile back, because even at 10:30 in the morning, there’s only one answer to that question.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  Josh  
  
  Monday, 7:02 AM. Pointless. That’s what today is going to be, along with the 179 school days that come after it. I’d contemplate the waste of it all now if I had the time, but I don’t. I’m gonna be late as it is. I head to the laundry room and yank some clothes out of the still-running dryer. I forgot to turn it on last night, but I don’t have time to wait; so now I’m stuck pulling on a pair of damp jeans while I walk and trying not to trip over myself. Whatever. It’s not like I’m surprised.  
  
  I grab a coffee mug out of the cabinet and attempt to fill it without spilling it all over the counter and burning myself in the process. I put it on the kitchen table, next to a shoe box full of prescription bottles, in time to see my grandfather coming out of his room. His white hair is so disheveled that he momentarily reminds me of a mad scientist. He walks alarmingly slow, but I know better than to offer to help him. He hates that. He used to be so badass and now he’s not, and he feels every bit of that loss.  
  
  “Coffee’s on the table,” I say, grabbing my keys and heading for the door. “I laid out your pills and logged them already. Bill’s coming in an hour. You sure you’ll be ok until then?”  
  
  “I’m not an invalid, Josh,” he practically growls at me. I try not to smile. He’s pissed. Pissed is good. It makes things seem a little bit normal.  
  
  I’m in my truck and down the driveway in seconds, but I’m not sure it’ll be enough. I don’t live far from school, but the back-up to get into the parking lot on the first day is always a bitch. Most teachers will look the other way today, but I wouldn’t have to worry about it anyway; no one’s going to give me a detention, late or not. I floor it, and a couple of minutes later, I’m waiting to get into the lot. The line of cars snakes out onto the road, but at least it’s periodically moving. I’m running on four hours of sleep and only one cup of coffee. I wish I had had time to grab another one for myself, but I didn’t, and it probably would have ended up in my lap by the time I got to school anyway.  
  
  I pull out my schedule while I’m idling and check it again. Shop isn’t until fourth period, but at least it’s not all the way at the end of the day. The rest of it I don’t give a shit about.  
  
  When I finally make it onto campus, Drew is out front with his usual followers, regaling them with any number of BS stories about his summer. I know they’re all BS because he spent most of the summer hanging out with me and I know for a fact that we didn’t do crap. Apart from the time he spent disappearing with whatever girl he was hooking up with, he was on my couch. Looking at him now, I don’t think there’s anyone happier to be back at school. I’d roll my eyes if it didn’t seem such a chick thing to do, so instead, I just stare blankly ahead and keep walking. He nods in my direction as I pass, and I return the gesture. I’ll talk to him later. He knows I won’t go near him when he’s surrounded. No one else acknowledges me and I pass through the rest of the crowds, into the main courtyard, just as the first bell rings.  
  
  My first three classes could all be the same. All I do is listen to rules, pick up syllabi and try to stay awake. My grandfather was up five times last night, which means I was up five times last night, too. I really have to start getting more sleep. In a week you will, I think bitterly, but I won’t dwell on that now.  
  
  10:45 AM. First lunch. I’d rather just head straight to shop. Eating this early sucks. I make my way to the courtyard and park myself on the back of the bench farthest from the center, the same one I’ve sat at for the past two years. No one bothers me because it’s easier to pretend I don’t exist. I’d rather spend the half-hour sweeping sawdust than sitting here, but there isn’t any sawdust to sweep yet. At least it’s early enough that the metal benches aren’t scorching under the sun. Now I just have to wait out the next thirty minutes, which will probably be the longest of the day.  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Nastya  
  
  Surviving. That’s what I’m doing now, and it hasn’t been quite as horrible as I expected. I get a lot of sideways looks, probably because of the way I’m dressed, but other than that, no one really talks to me. Except for Drew, the Ken doll. I did run into him this morning, but mostly it was a non-event. He talked. I walked. He gave up. I’ve made it to lunch and this is the test. No one’s really had much of an opportunity for socializing yet, so I’ve been able to skate below the surface, but lunch is just a highly unsupervised hell dimension. Avoidance seems the best option at first, but I have to face the looks and the comments at some point. Personally, I’d rather shove a cactus up my ass, but apparently that option isn’t on the table, so I might as well just rip the Band-Aid off now and get it over with. Then, I’ll find an empty restroom and check my hair and fix my lipstick or as we cowards like to call it‌—‌hide.  
  
  I try to surreptitiously check out my clothes and make sure nothing’s where it shouldn’t be and that I’m not flashing anything more than I’d originally planned. I’ve got on the same stilettos as Friday, but this time I went with a low cut black tank top and an almost non-existent skirt that my ass doesn’t look half-bad in. I left my hair down so it falls past my shoulders and covers the scar on my forehead. My eyes are rimmed with thick black eyeliner. It’s slutty and probably only attractive to the basest of human creatures. Drew. I smile to myself as I recall him looking me up and down in the hallway this morning. Barbie would be pissed.  
  
  I don’t dress this way because I like it so much or because I want people to stare at me in general. But people are going to stare at me for the wrong reasons anyway, and if they are going to stare at me for the wrong reasons, then at least I should get to pick them. Plus, a little unwelcome staring is a small price to pay for scaring everyone off. I don’t think there’s a girl in the school who will want to talk to me, and any boy who’s interested probably won’t be much for conversation. And so what? If I’m going to get unwanted attention, better it be for my ass than for my psychosis and my effed-up hand.  
  
  Margot hadn’t gotten home by the time I left for school this morning or she might have tried to talk me out of it. I wouldn’t have blamed her. I think my first period teacher wanted to nail me on a dress code violation when I first walked in; but once he checked my name on his roster, he ushered  
me to a seat and didn’t look at me again for the rest of the class.  
  
  Three years ago, my mother would have had a fit, cried, lamented her shortcomings as a parent, or possibly just locked me in my room, if she saw me at school like this. Today, she’d look disappointed but would ask if it made me happy and I’d nod my head and lie so we could pretend it wasn’t a problem. The clothes probably wouldn’t even be the biggest issue, because I’m not sure she would mind the streetwalker uniform nearly as much as the make-up. My mother loves her face. It’s not out of arrogance or conceit; it’s out of respect. She’s grateful for what she was born with. She should be. It’s an awesome face, a perfect face, an ethereal face. The kind people write songs and poems and suicide notes about. It’s that exotic kind of beauty that men in romance novels obsess over, even if they have no idea who you are, because they must possess you. That kind of beauty. That’s my mom. I grew up wanting to look just like her. Some people tell me I do, and maybe it’s true, under there somewhere. If you scrape off the make-up and dress me to look like a girl as opposed to what I look like now‌—‌a profanity-spewing guttersnipe being dragged out of a crack house on Cops.  
  
  I imagine my mother shaking her head and giving me the disappointed look, but she chooses her battles these days and I’m not sure this one would make the cut. Mom’s beginning to believe I may be a lost cause and that’s a good thing. Because I am, and I left her house so she could accept it. I was a lost cause a long time ago. That thought makes me sad for my mother, because she didn’t ask for any of this. She thought she’d gotten her miracle, and I was the only one who knew she hadn’t, no matter how much I wanted to give it to her. Maybe I was the one who took it away.  
  
  Which brings me back to the courtyard, where I am still waiting on the outskirts like a guest on an episode of Extreme Avoidance: High School Edition. I planned to get here early enough to make it across before lunch was in full swing, but I got sidelined by my history teacher, and that three minutes meant the difference between a half-empty courtyard and the one teeming with students that I’m staring at right now. I’m focused, at the moment, on the brick pavers covering the entirety of said courtyard, and seriously questioning the wisdom of my four-and-a-half-inch stilettos. I’m gauging my odds of making it across with both my ankles and my dignity intact when I hear a voice to my right call out.  
  
  I turn instinctively, but I know immediately that it’s the wrong thing to do. Sitting on a bench, a couple feet away, is the owner of that voice and he’s looking right at me. He’s leaning back casually, with his legs spread farther apart than they need to be in a blatant display of wishful thinking. He smiles, and I can’t deny that he knows he’s good-looking. If self-adoration were cologne, he would be the boy you couldn’t stand next to without choking. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Like me. We could be brother and sister, or one of those really creepy couples who look like they should be brother and sister. I’m pissed at myself for looking. Now, when I turn and ignore him to make my way across the battlefield, I can be certain that his eyes‌—‌as well as every other set of eyes on that bench with him‌—‌are going to be trained on my back. And when I say my back, I mean my ass. I re-contemplate the unstable surface of the pavers. No pressure or anything. I avert my eyes back to the task at hand in time to hear him add, “If you’re looking for someplace to sit, my lap is free. ” And there it is. It’s not even clever or original, but his equally wit-free friends laugh anyway. There go my hopes for our bourgeoning sibling kinship. I step off the ledge and start walking, keeping my eyes trained straight ahead as if I have some purpose outside of simply surviving this walk. I’m not even halfway through the day. I still have four of the seven classes left on the schedule that shit gave birth to.

I always look for convenience, performance, and quality in a coffee maker because I’m someone who cannot function properly without my morning caffeine. This model doesn’t disappoint in terms of functionality, but there are elements that could be improved. Throughout this review, I'll discuss the features, upsides, and areas for improvement to give you a comprehensive picture of this coffee maker.

**Sleek and Compact Design**

The design of the Keurig K-Express is what initially caught my attention. It’s sleek, stylish, and compact enough to fit on my crowded kitchen counter without taking up too much space. Being only 7 inches wide, it’s perfect even for smaller apartments or offices. Its lightweight build—just over 4 pounds—also makes it easy to move around if needed. Plus, the modern black finish gives it a sophisticated look that matches most kitchen aesthetics. However, I noticed that the plastic material feels a bit less premium than I had hoped, which might turn off those looking for something sturdier.

**Effortless Brewing Options**

As someone who loves variety but doesn’t like spending ages fiddling with settings, I appreciate the three brewing sizes: 8, 10, and 12 ounces. These cover most coffee drink preferences, and the buttons are clearly labeled, making the process almost foolproof. The dedicated strong brew feature has been a lifesaver on groggy mornings when I need that extra punch of caffeine. While the brewing process is quick, taking less than a couple of minutes, it does emit a louder noise than expected. It’s not super disruptive, but it might be a dealbreaker for very early risers who don’t want to wake others in the house.

**Capacity and Reservoir Convenience**

The 42-ounce removable reservoir is excellent for those who make several cups of coffee throughout the day. I don’t like wasting time refilling water, so this feature lets me brew up to four cups before needing to refill. Removing the reservoir for cleaning or refilling is a breeze, fitting seamlessly into the overall user-friendly design. That said, I do wish there were water-level markers on the reservoir. It’s a minor nuisance to have to guess when it’s time to top it up.

**Energy Efficiency and Eco-Friendliness**

The auto-off feature is one of my favorite aspects of this machine. It shuts off five minutes after the last brew, which is great for saving energy and ensuring safety if you forget to turn it off manually. The compatibility with the My K-Cup universal reusable coffee filter is another strong point; you can use your favorite ground coffee instead of relying solely on K-Cups, which is both cost-effective and better for the environment. However, the reusable filters are sold separately, which feels like an extra hurdle for those just wanting to reduce their waste right away.

**Highlights**

- Sleek and space-saving design for small spaces  
- 42-ounce removable reservoir allows multiple brews before refilling  
- Strong brew button provides an extra kick for coffee lovers  
- Energy-efficient auto-off feature saves power  
- Compatible with reusable coffee filters for environmental friendliness  

**Areas of Concern**

- Build quality feels less premium due to its plastic material  
- The coffee maker can be noisy while operating  
- Absence of water-level markers on the reservoir  
- Reusable filter not included in the package  

**Product Rivals**

Several competitors in the single-serve coffee maker market challenge the Keurig K-Express. For instance, the Nespresso Vertuo offers excellent flavor quality with its coffee pods, but it lacks the brewing versatility that Keurig offers with its reusable coffee filter compatibility. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew provides both single-serve and full-pot brewing options, making it appealing to households with diverse tastes. However, the FlexBrew is bulkier and more complex to use than the straightforward K-Express. From my experience, the Keurig K-Express stands out for its simplicity, speed, and compact design, but if sound levels or build material bother you, exploring alternatives like Breville or Nespresso might make sense.

**Affordable Quality**

When it comes to cost-efficiency, the Keurig K-Express strikes a decent balance between affordability and features. While it doesn’t scream luxury, the machine offers excellent value for money with its brew-quality options, energy-saving mode, and versatility. For anyone wanting to enjoy quick, fuss-free coffee without paying a premium price, this fits the bill nicely. That said, investing in a more robust and quieter model could be worth considering if you don’t mind spending extra.

I heard back about a job I really want at the top company in my field. Did 3 rounds of interviews, an assessment, and flew out to the company headquarters for a final 3 round panel. I crushed every part of the interview process, only to not get the job. The recruiter told me that my feedback was so overwhelmingly positive that I am still being considered for the same position, just on a different team.

I did two more interviews last Monday for two different teams (one hour each). Only to find out on Friday I wouldn’t get to move forward with either team. The recruiter told me that Q1/Q3 is their big hiring spree, and my best chance would be a backfill role in Q4 or Q1.

Obviously I was hurt by the news. I put a ton of effort into the 2 month interview process as my company is actively collapsing (I’m literally one of two people left on my team). I gave myself the weekend, and then formulated a plan to ice out the competition for Q4/Q1.

Basically, keep the connections between me and the people I interviewed with warm, as well as my recruiters, and reach out to my network for introductions to people who work at the company for coffee/virtual chats. Develop an internal alliance of people who can vouch for me so I can effectively ice out the competition next time. This week I already sent messages to the recruiter, one guy who advocated really hard for me during the interview process (still haven’t heard back from either).

I’m also trying to get interviews at competitors as well as other positions. So I’m keeping myself open to other opportunities as well. 

My headspace hasn’t been 100% since last week. I’ve been pretty depressed, angry, and heartbroken yet motivated and determined.

Am I crazy for doing this? When should I say it’s too much and just move on? Obviously I don’t want to scare them away from me, and I want to protect myself from more hurt and anger. Should I stop?",3,1755280729.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

I always burnt my calories extremely fast. In fact, when I drink coffee, I can feel the effects within minutes. It is the same with Elvanse (lisdex) where I surprisingly feel some initial build up of euphoria few minutes after oral administration which for some reason goes dead silent after another few minutes and then this cycle happens a second time but stronger after 1-2 hours. Interestingly enough, my bowel movements coincide with these two cycles too. After that beginning phase there is stomach discomfort and movement and need to go toilet but I can wait. Second stage is where the bowel movements get more intense and there is a more urgent need for the toilet which is when I typically decide to listen. 

This definitely can’t be unrelated to how early my med wears off. There are important details in between the 10 AM and 2 PM however. When I lose some (not all) focus at around 1 PM and my headache gets mildly annoying (caffeine withdrawal, which by the way could be the cause of reduced focus) that is when I decide to drink a cup of coffee. I also read that caffeine that speed up your rate of metabolism (unverified, I struggle to thoroughly research a topic with reputable sources and large data samples). Caff withdrawal could be the cause of the declining focus but at the same time drinking coffee could cause the meds to wear off faster. If hypothesis is correct, drinking coffee could be good AND bad for me with the only solution being cutting it off completely (but I am currently titrating and therefore trying to collect data, as best as one can collect with an addiction to caffeine)

Allegedly, fast metabolism can mean 4x faster so (assuming linearity) 12-hour lisdex dose would last 12/4=3 hours with less side effects which could explain why i have no side effects on 50mg",3,1755280682.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

We've talked before and got to know our hometowns were nearby. From our few interactions i understood this guy was either autistic or had aspergers, so I tried to be considerate. One day, I saw him while returning from work and gave a wave, he waved back and I thought that was the end of that interaction and walked to a nearby cafe. As I was sipping coffee, i simply glanced out the glass walls and saw this dude looking directly at me. He was pacing back and forth, waiting. So I finish my coffee and go outside. 

He rushed up to me and asks, "" You planning to go home this weekend?"" I said yes and he insisted on us travelling together. I felt bad for the guy because everyone else in the building usually avoids him, so i agreed to it. We travelled together twice and both times this dude wanted to do everything together- Eat together, accompany him to the bathroom and evem borrowed money from me. He got way too reliant on me and I don't even know the guy. I got fed up and stopped talking to him after that.

From then on, I would always lie when he asked if I was going home. After a while, I began to see less of him and was relieved. Until one day, returning from work, I randomly glanced back and saw this dude following, his eyes fixated on me. I ignored him and and kept walking to my apartment. Most days since then I would see this dude, following me and I tried to brush it off. 

I was with work friends at a restaurant near my office and I see this dude in the corner of my eye standing outside staring at me. I was filled with rage so I excused myself and walked out to talk to him. He came up to me and asked if I was going home. I just blew up- I asked him why he was stalking me and he instantly began to apologize. I told him I didn't want to travel with him and he begged me telling he wanted to, for his comfort. I told him we don't always get what we want and threatened that i would beat him up the next I saw him. He apologized and quickly walked away.

So am I the asshole? Cuz he's obviously autistic and I didn't find any empathy in me to be considerate to him after what he did. Could I have handled this better?

I told him I’d never make him pay me back a dollar and I’d give him more than a dollar if he ever needed without making him pay me back. Even if he borrowed $20 from me I wouldn’t asked to be paid back. He was adamant about his dollar and I called him pathetic (Venmo him the dollar) and left.

Then she does it AGAIN,  next time I go thru. So this is twice now she’s gone out of her way to come and talk to me, I asked for her name, and then I leave…I didn’t want to ask her out with 3 of her coworkers right there, in case she wanted to say no..

well I went thru 6 more times and the opportunity to ask her out hasn’t came again. She’s working and even if she wanted to come and talk to me, she couldn’t have. 

Well I left today and I searched her first name on insta, it was the 2nd name that popped up…

I want to shoot my shot already…although it wasn’t that hard to find her, she only gave me her first name, I’m not afraid to ask her in person but every time I’ve gone in afterwards the opportunity isn’t there. 

Am I weirdo to add her and dm her? 😂 every date I’ve gotten I’ve just asked in person or thru a dating app. 

I’m an Aquarius, I honestly couldn’t care less and don’t find it weird. If I was attracted, I’d be happy they went out of their way to talk to me. But I’m not everyone else or a woman and don’t want to seem creepy if it normally would be.

One of them moved in the same time I did about a year and a half ago and we are cool. 

The other one is new and she just moved in last week. The Roommate who left before her completely furnished the house before I moved in,  and took everything when they left. 

I wound up buying a couch and coffee table and pulled things from my room, including a 65 inch TV to make a super cute and comfy living room so it wasn’t just empty. 

Fast forward to this week the new Roommate wants to get rid of the couch I just bought and make the TV the central focus of the living room. 

The Roommate I get along with and I don’t want the living room to be so focused on the TV, we’d much rather keep it relaxing and create a reading nook and give it more of an academic vibe. The TV swivels and can easily be viewed from the existing couch. 

The new Roommate sent me a barrage of inspo pics that absolutely do not vibe with what we already have going on, nor work with the actual space itself. 

I asked her to respectfully please leave the living room as I furnished it for now because I just set it up and bought stuff. She is more than welcome to go nuts on the kitchen or the dining room area which are currently empty. (Her room isn’t even furnished yet)

She wants to get white vinyl swivel chairs and floor pillows- very much not our style. She was rather pushy about redoing the space entirely. 

I just ignored it, I’m never home anyway but now she wants to have a household meeting next week. 

Here’s where I’m pissed. I’m 36, I pay my bills and I clean up after myself. I come and go as I please. I don’t want to have a household meeting, I don’t care to. If she has an issue she can address it with my roommate or myself directly. It’s starting to feel like I’m living with a dorm girl and I’m seriously considering leaving. 

I have zero drama, I’m a grown adult and I have great taste. I don’t want to live in a Miami Coke penthouse and I do not wish to have a meeting to set house rules or whatever. AIO for telling her I don’t think it’s necessary? AIO for telling her to leave my shit alone for a minute so I can at least enjoy it ?

# How Can You Make‌ Black Paint? The Ultimate 2025 ‌Guide

Making black paint might seem straightforward, ⁢but achieving a truly deep, rich, and ⁣lightfast black requires understanding color ⁤theory, pigment selection, and binder properties.⁤ This comprehensive guide explores the ​science and art⁢ behind creating your⁢ own remarkable‍ black paint in ‌2025.It goes beyond simply mixing colors, delving into the nuances that separate‍ a muddy, ‍lackluster‍ black ⁢from ⁤a captivating, professional-grade one.

**understanding⁢ black: More Than Just the ‍Absence of Light**

Black,contrary ​to popular belief,isn't simply the absence of light or color. It's a complex visual ⁢experience resulting ‍from the absorption of most​ wavelengths of light by ‍a surface. The perception of​ black is​ also heavily⁢ influenced by the surrounding colors, the texture⁣ of the painted⁣ surface, and even the lighting conditions.A deep understanding ⁢of these influences is essential for crafting a black paint that meets your specific ⁢artistic​ or practical needs. The ⁣""blackest black""⁣ materials actually structure surfaces‍ to absorb almost 100% of incident light.

**The Limitations of Mixing Colors to Create Black**

While the⁤ idea of mixing primary colors (red, yellow, and blue) ⁤to create black ⁣is a common starting⁢ point, it often ⁣yields ⁤disappointing results. The resulting color typically ends up as a‍ muddy brown or a dull,desaturated ‍black. This is because pigments are inherently imperfect; they don't absorb ⁢all colors ​except for the ones⁣ they reflect. Mixing⁣ multiple pigments introduces a complex interaction of absorption and reflection that reduces the overall⁤ darkness and purity of the color. Furthermore,the precise hues‌ of the primary⁣ colors used significantly impact the resulting mixture. Using slightly off-tone primaries will almost certainly yield‌ a less-than-perfect black.

**Selecting the Right Pigments: The Key to⁢ a Rich Black**

The most⁣ effective way to create true black paint is by using ​dedicated black pigments. Here’s a ‍breakdown ‌of common and effective ‌options:

*   ***Carbon Black (PBk7):**  This is a classic and⁢ widely used black​ pigment known ⁣for its​ deep, intense color and excellent lightfastness. It's derived from burning organic‌ materials and comes in various ⁤grades, from lamp black ​(soot) to ivory black (traditionally from charred animal bones, ​now often a ​synthetic substitute). Lamp black tends to​ have larger particles, making it suitable ⁢for​ glazes, ​while ⁣other carbon blacks ⁣offer a‍ more matte finish. Carbon blacks⁣ are incredibly versatile and⁣ work well in⁤ various ​paint types, including oil, acrylic, and ‌watercolor. Some forms,⁣ however, can be ‌more arduous to ​disperse⁤ fully, requiring careful​ grinding.

   ***Mars black‌ (Synthetic Iron⁤ Oxide Black):***  Mars black is a synthetic iron oxide, offering excellent opacity and ⁤permanence. it's typically ‌less intense than carbon black, leaning towards a slightly warmer, more neutral black. Its consistent particle size and chemical stability make it ⁤a reliable choice, especially for​ applications ⁣requiring durability. Many consider it preferable‌ in certain applications due to its ease of dispersion.It is chemically ⁣inert making​ it a safer pigment‍ to work with compared⁣ to some carbon blacks.

*   ***Ivory Black (PBk9):**  Typically made from charred animal bones.This pigment produces a warm, slightly brownish ⁢black of notable transparency. Due to its ethical implications and the availability ‍of‍ synthetic alternatives, the‍ authentic bone-derived version‌ is becoming less ⁢common. Synthetic versions attempt⁣ to⁣ replicate the​ unique‌ characteristics ‌of traditional ivory black without using⁣ animal products.

   ***Perylene Black (PBk31):***  A ⁣relatively modern organic pigment,‌ perylene black offers ​a very deep, neutral black with ⁢exceptional tinting strength. It is known for‍ its excellent lightfastness and resistance ‍to fading. Perylene black can ‌be ⁢slightly more expensive than ⁢other black pigments, but its‌ intense color and durability make​ it a worthwhile investment⁣ for professional artists.

**Binders and ⁣Vehicles:⁣ Choosing the Right Medium**

The binder or vehicle is the‌ substance that‍ holds the pigment particles‍ together⁢ and allows the paint to adhere to a‍ surface. The ‌choice of binder significantly impacts the paint's properties, ⁢including its ‍drying time, sheen, and durability.

*   ***oil Paint:**  ‌Oil ‌paints are‌ made by suspending ⁣pigment particles in drying oils, such as linseed oil, walnut oil, or​ poppyseed oil. Linseed oil is ​the most commonly used due to⁤ its affordability and excellent​ film-forming properties.‍ Oil paints offer a rich, vibrant color and‌ a long ⁢working time, allowing for blending and layering. Though, they also have a longer drying time compared to ​acrylics.Black oil paints are⁤ frequently enough prized due to their ability to achieve extremely ⁣deep and lustrous ⁣tones. The slow​ drying time​ means you ⁢can‌ work on a painting over ‍several days.

   ***Acrylic Paint:***  Acrylic paints use a ⁤synthetic ‍polymer emulsion⁢ as the binder. they dry quickly to form a flexible, water-resistant film. Acrylics are versatile ⁣and can ‍be​ used on various surfaces. Black acrylic paints are readily​ available and offer good ​opacity and lightfastness. They are‍ easier to​ clean‍ up ⁢than oil paints (with just water),⁣ which is ‌a‌ big plus for‍ many artists.

*   ***Watercolor paint:**  Watercolor paints⁢ use gum arabic as the binder. They are transparent and create delicate washes ‌of color. Black watercolor paints are often‌ used for adding shadows and details. ⁣However, achieving⁤ a truly deep ⁢black in watercolor can be challenging due to the transparent nature of the medium. Multiple layers or concentrated washes may ⁢be necessary.

   ***Egg Tempera:***  Egg tempera is a traditional painting medium that uses egg⁣ yolk​ as the binder. ⁢It dries quickly to‌ form a matte finish.Black egg tempera paint can be made using black pigments and egg yolk.‍ It ​offers a unique luminosity‌ and archival quality.

**Formulating Your Own Black Paint:​ A Step-by-Step Guide**

Creating your​ own black paint allows for ‌complete control over the ⁣pigment load,⁤ binder type, and overall characteristics of the paint. The process involves⁣ carefully mixing the‍ pigment with ⁣the selected ‍binder until‍ a smooth, homogenous ‍paste ​is formed.
*  ***Gather Your Materials:***  You'll need your⁤ chosen black pigment,‍ your preferred binder (oil, acrylic medium, gum arabic solution, or egg yolk, depending on your desired paint type), ⁤a palette knife or muller, a glass or marble slab for grinding, and ‌airtight‌ containers for storage.

*  ***Prepare the Pigment:***  Some pigments may be lumpy or require pre-grinding. Use a mortar and pestle or a small⁤ coffee grinder (dedicated solely to pigment grinding) to break up any clumps and ensure ‌a smooth​ consistency.

*  ***Combine Pigment and Binder:***  Start by adding a ‍small amount of‍ the binder to the pigment⁤ and gently mix with the palette knife or muller. Gradually add ​more binder until ⁣the pigment is fully wetted and a⁢ thick⁤ paste forms.

*  ***Grind⁣ the Pigment:***  ​ This step is⁤ crucial ⁢for achieving a ‌smooth, even consistency and ensuring that the pigment ⁢particles are fully dispersed in the binder. Use the ​muller to grind the mixture on the glass or marble‍ slab, ‌applying ⁤consistent pressure and working‌ in a circular motion.​ Continue grinding​ until ⁤the paint is ‍smooth and ‍free of any grittiness.This process can take some time, depending​ on the pigment and ⁤the binder used.

*  ***Adjust the Consistency:***  ‌Once the grinding is complete,⁤ assess the consistency of the ‍paint. If it's​ too ⁢thick, add a small amount of additional binder to thin it out.⁣ If ‌it's too thin, add a ​small ​amount of additional pigment to thicken it.

*  ***Store the Paint:***  Transfer the finished paint to an airtight container to ⁣prevent it ⁢from drying out.⁢ Label the container with the pigment ‍used, the binder type, and the date of manufacture.

**Tips and Tricks ⁣for Achieving a Superb Black**

*   ***Use ⁢High-Quality pigments:**  The⁣ quality of the pigment directly impacts the intensity and permanence of the black paint. Invest in artist-grade pigments from reputable manufacturers.

   ***Grind Thoroughly:***  Proper grinding ensures that the pigment particles⁣ are ⁣fully dispersed in the ‌binder, resulting in a smooth, even consistency and maximizing the color intensity.

*   ***Watch for Over-Grinding:**  ⁢While​ thorough grinding is‍ essential, ⁤over-grinding can damage the⁣ pigment ‍particles and reduce the paint's color intensity.

   ***Experiment⁣ with Modifiers:***  Adding a small amount of other pigments, such as a touch of ultramarine blue or ⁤burnt ⁣umber,​ can‌ subtly ‌alter the hue of the​ black paint⁣ and create unique effects.

*   ***Test ⁣the Paint:*** Before using the paint⁤ in a ⁢final artwork, test it on a scrap piece of paper⁢ or canvas to‍ assess its color, consistency, and drying time.

**Sustainability and⁢ Ethical Considerations**

the production of some ⁤black pigments, such as ivory black derived from animal ⁢bones, raises ‌ethical concerns. Opting for ⁤synthetic alternatives or⁤ carbon-neutral carbon‍ blacks is ‍a more lasting​ and ethical choice. Consider the environmental impact​ of the pigments and binders used in your paint and choose eco-amiable options ​whenever ⁢possible. Research brands ​that ⁤are ‍committed to sustainable and ethical‍ practices.**The Future of Black Paint: Nanotechnology and Beyond**

Advancements in⁣ nanotechnology are paving the way for new ‍and innovative black⁣ pigments with exceptional light absorption properties.⁢ Materials like vertically aligned carbon nanotubes ‍can absorb​ almost all ​incident light, creating incredibly deep and non-reflective black ⁤surfaces.⁢ These technologies could revolutionize ⁢the creation of black paint,⁣ offering⁤ unprecedented levels of intensity and darkness. Expect to see‌ increasingly ‍elegant and ⁢sustainable black ⁢pigments⁤ emerging in the years to come.

**Conclusion: Mastering the Art of Black**

Creating truly excellent⁢ black⁢ paint involves understanding the science ​of‍ color, meticulously selecting pigments, choosing appropriate binders, ⁢and mastering ⁤the art ‌of grinding⁢ and ⁣mixing. By following the guidelines outlined in this comprehensive guide,you⁢ can create ‍your own exceptional black paint that⁣ meets your specific ​artistic⁢ or practical needs. ‍Embrace experimentation and continue to refine your⁣ techniques to unlock⁢ the full potential of ​this basic‍ color.

(From a girl who finds lots of comfort in clothes and material things).","One of my personal goals in life is to become less attached to the things I own and to be able to find comfort in myself outside of the things I own. I wanted to post here because I felt like maybe this community could help me understand how to do that, or, at least feel less alone in these struggles and offer some personal anecdotes or insights into how they're working to achieve that (or book recommendations on the subject, because I won't ever say no to a book!).

  
For context, I'm ""that girl"". I'm the kind of person who finds a lot of comfort and joy in having a wardrobe that follows a particular aesthetic (namely outdoorsy, ""granola girl"" aesthetics and emo, punk aesthetics). The unfortunate thing about it, is that those aesthetics don't really lend themselves well to a ""minimal"" closet. They lend themselves to sets of pants, shorts, shoes, socks, cardigans, jackets, graphic tees, etc. in at least six different colors and the list goes on and on.

  
This isn't just limited to my closet either, it's also found in the home. I'm what you'd consider ""a maximalist"". I love trinkets, I love posters, I love random coffee mugs with different colors, sayings, etc.; I love logos and different magnets from different characters, companies, etc. Send me into an antique shop and I'll go wild like a kid in a candy store. I'm not a hoarder by any means, but I love having a house that's colorful, coordinated, and full of life.

  
Lately, I've been finding myself thinking, ""Why?"" Why do I purchase these things? Do they actually make me happy or am I trying to fill a void? What am I trying to prove to myself or others by having all of this stuff? Why do I keep buying this stuff?

  
I've noticed, for lack of a better phrase, that I find a lot of ""suffering"" in tying my identity to physical, material things, and I'm not sure what to do with any of that information. It's difficult as well because with marketing all around us, they always make it feel like they ""know you"" and ""know that this graphic tee or uniquely colored sweater"" is going to make you feel more ""you"". And it's like, what am I trying to prove?

  
I'm sorry for ranting here, but, any thoughts? Any advice?  ""Granola Girl"" or not, have you been able to work on changing your perceptions and attachments to the things around you and just be content with yourself? What did you do to achieve that? Were any books helpful along the way?",3,1755279982.0,minimalism,5,0.71,False

1mr4vje,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1mr4vje/worried_zero_appetite/,Worried - Zero Appetite,"Hi all, 

I started my journey and first dose 6 days ago (2.125mg) and am worried about how little my appetite is and how the lack of calories is effecting my overall health / energy. I’m wondering if this is to be expected as my body adjusts, or if I should consider taking a smaller dose, waiting longer than a week to take the second dose, or any other advice / recommendations you might have?!?

An overview of current food consumption:

Breakfast 
-one cup of coffee w/ collagen (10mg protein) and 1/3 cup whole milk 
-two eggs, slice of toast 
- electrolyte drink 

Lunch 
- protein shake (haven’t been able to consume more than 12 ounces)

Snack 
- handful of berries or apples (3-4 slices) 

Dinner 
- 1/4 to 1/3  cup of veggie
- small fillet of fish or chicken breast 


The above is best case scenario, but I can’t say I’ve been able to eat all of the above in one day - sometimes I can’t seem to get any of the protein shake down, or can only eat half of breakfast. 

I’ve struggled to workout, feel light headed constantly and just generally weak. When I have attempted to eat more, I feel sick to my stomach like I just ate the largest and greasiest meal of my life.

1mr4tkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mr4tkt/the_man_who_kept_knocking/,The Man Who Kept Knocking,"I’m not writing this for attention. I’m writing it because my hands won’t stop shaking at 1:30 a.m., and because every night that passes makes the details slide around in my head like oil on glass. If I don’t put it somewhere, I’ll start doubting what I heard and saw. And I can’t afford to doubt it, not with how precise he is.

I live alone in a one-bedroom on the third floor of a brick building that used to be a hotel in the 60s. The hallway carpet still has that faded pattern of red paisley that never really looks clean no matter how many times the super runs a shampooer over it. My door is the fourth on the right after the stairs. It’s got a newer knob and a deadbolt, but the frame is old wood and the peephole sits just a little too low, like it was drilled by someone guessing.

The first time he knocked was a Thursday, a little after one in the morning. I was half-asleep on the couch with a true-crime documentary playing on my laptop. The knock wasn’t frantic. It was patient: three even taps, like a teacher asking a classroom to quiet down. Tap… tap… tap. Then nothing.

I waited for whoever it was to either knock again or say who they were. When neither happened, I went to the door and looked through the peephole. The hallway was empty, just the emergency light making that cold cone on the carpet. I almost laughed at myself. I’ve got neighbors who have parties at weird hours; sound bounces around that stairwell and does strange things.

I turned off the laptop and went to bed. At 2:34 I woke up because I’d dreamed the same three taps. When I lay still, listening to the building hum, I heard them again. Tap… tap… tap. I sat up, heart going like I’d run stairs. I didn’t look through the peephole that time. I told myself if I didn’t engage, whoever it was would get bored. The tapping didn’t come back.

On Friday it happened again, 1:30 a.m., the same three even knocks. I checked the peephole. Nothing. I messaged the building group chat to ask if anyone was having someone over who might be confused about the floor. No replies, just a thumbs-up from a guy on two who’s always drunk and thinks everything is hilarious.

Saturday night I made coffee at eleven and decided to wait it out. I’d prove to myself it was just pipes or heat expansion or something physical that my brain was turning into a pattern. At 1:33, as if I’d set an alarm I didn’t know about, I heard it again. Tap… tap… tap.

This time I slid to the door in my socks and looked through the peephole immediately, trying to catch whoever was moving away. Someone was there.

He was tall and thin, wearing a long dark coat that looked too heavy for late spring. He stood perfectly still, facing my door, head tilted like he was listening to the wood. I couldn’t make out details of his face. The emergency light hit him from the back and flattened everything.

I was about to say something when he lifted his left hand. He held it at shoulder height and moved his index finger in a slow circle, then drew three short lines in the air, one after another. It wasn’t a knock gesture. It was like he was writing on invisible glass. After the third line, he put his hand down and stayed there, motionless.

“Can I help you?” My voice sounded smaller than I meant it to.

No response. He didn’t even twitch.

“Wrong apartment,” I tried. “You’ve got the wrong door.”

He stayed another few seconds, then turned without hurry and walked toward the stairs. I watched him until he disappeared. The quiet after he left felt like the moment when a dentist takes their hand out of your mouth and your tongue is suddenly this strange muscle you don’t know what to do with. I realized I was holding the door frame so hard my fingers hurt.

I called the non-emergency police line and explained. The operator was patient. She said she’d send a car through, but unless he was forcing entry or making threats, there wasn’t much they could do. I know how that sounds online: “the cops didn’t care.” It wasn’t like that. They cared. It’s just that standing in a hallway is not a crime, no matter how much your stomach flips over it.

Sunday I bought a door security bar—the kind that braces under the knob—and one of those wedges you kick under the door. I told myself I’d sleep better. I also covered the peephole with a strip of electrical tape after reading an article about reverse peephole viewers. I’d never thought about that before: that from the hall, with the right little lens, someone could see you as if the hole was a window.

Sunday night the knocks came at 1:27. Three, even. I didn’t look. I sat on the floor in the dark kitchen with a butter knife in my hand and felt exactly like a kid hiding from a game where the rules were unclear.

Monday afternoon I caught the super, Manny, in the basement by the washers and told him. He’s in his fifties, soft-spoken, reads the paper in a lawn chair out back when the weather’s decent.

“You get a look at his face?” he asked.

“No. Just the coat, the height. The way he moved his hand. Like…” I made the small circles with my finger and felt stupid copying someone else’s gesture.

Manny didn’t laugh. He took a folded piece of masking tape from his pocket and put it over the peephole, smoothing the edges. “Don’t take that off,” he said. “People do weird things. You call me next time.”

That night I messaged a friend, Jonah, and asked if he’d stay over. He brought a sleeping bag and a baseball bat and told me if the guy knocked, we’d open the door and ask him what the hell his problem was. At 1:24, the tapping started. We were both awake. Jonah stood up, bat in hand. I put a hand on his arm and shook my head. We waited, not breathing. The taps didn’t come again. Jonah stayed until three, making jokes about how I’d made him miss his bedtime for a ghost with good manners.

Tuesday afternoon there were three small chalk marks on my door frame at shoulder height. Pale, like someone had brushed a carpenter’s pencil there and then wiped it partially away. I ran a paper towel over them. The towel came back gray. I know what you’re thinking: I could’ve missed those since I don’t inspect my door frame every day. You’re right. I don’t. But I’d cleaned around the knob when I put the tape on the peephole. They weren’t there then.

I set my phone to record audio that night. I put it on a chair by the door and turned on airplane mode so nothing would cut the recording. I shut off all the lights, wedged the door, braced the bar, and tried to breathe like I wasn’t listening with every atom of my body.

At 1:19 I heard footsteps on the recording, precise and slow. They paused. The mic picked up the faintest rasp—fabric against wood? Then: tap… tap… tap. After ten seconds, three taps again, lighter. Then a whisper. The whisper was so soft I had to max the volume and press the phone to my ear to make words out of it. I could be wrong. But I swear I heard: “You’re there.”

I sent the file to Jonah and to Manny. I called the police again and played part of it over the phone. This time, two officers came by, walked the halls, and knocked on my neighbors’ doors, waking a couple people who were understandably annoyed. They didn’t find anyone in the building who matched my description. They suggested I get a simple motion camera and pointed me to a model that stores clips locally.

I bought two the next morning. One facing the door from the inside, one covering the living room and kitchen. I know that sounds paranoid, but the price of not knowing what happens between midnight and two was higher than a couple plastic cameras and a microSD card. I also bought a cheap doorbell camera for the outside, but since it’s an interior hallway and not my property, I didn’t install it. I was trying not to be that tenant everyone resents.

Wednesday the knocking came at 1:07. Three knocks. Then three lighter. Then nothing. The interior camera caught the sound perfectly and caught me standing perfectly still in my hallway with a ridiculous knife in my hand. Manny texted at 1:10: “Police on the way. Don’t open.” They came, went floor to floor, checked the stairwell. One officer asked if he could sit inside my apartment in the dark for a few nights and wait with me. He wasn’t promising anything; he just said, “Sometimes people like this escalate. Better we see it.”

He sat with me Thursday night. He told me to call him T. He was maybe mid-thirties, built like he actually did the gym memberships the station gets, and he spoke quietly in the way people do when they’ve done a lot of night shifts. We sat on my floor with the lights off and whispered about unrelated things so I’d keep breathing. At 12:58 he touched my arm to still me. I heard it too: a soft scuff outside, like a shoe toe against carpet. Then his head tilted. He took out his phone and typed something quickly to whoever was parked on the street. The three taps came at exactly 1:00.

T didn’t move toward the door. He looked at the peephole and then at me, at the strip of black tape I’d left over it. He stood and pressed his palm flat to the door, then took it away and showed me his hand. There were three faint gray lines on his skin.

“Chalk,” he mouthed.

The taps didn’t come again that night. At 1:15 T’s phone buzzed. He checked it and whispered: “No one on the stairs, no one on camera at the entrance. If he’s in the building, he tailgated and is staying out of view.” He left around two. Before he went, he looked at my deadbolt. “You need longer screws in your strike plate,” he said. “Those half-inch ones don’t grab. Get three-inch. Into the stud.”

I spent Friday with a screwdriver and YouTube. Longer screws, a secondary slide lock at the top, a little adhesive alarm that would shriek if the door moved while armed. I covered the gap at the bottom with a heavier draft stopper. It looked ridiculous. It also let me close my eyes for more than fifteen seconds without my heart sprinting.

Friday night there was no knock. Saturday, none. I started to relax in the way you do after a fever breaks. I left the bathroom light on, fell asleep at midnight. And woke at 1:33 to my phone buzzing. Unknown device detected moving with you. I sat up so fast I smacked my head on the wall. The phone showed the pop-up Apple gives you when it feels an AirTag you don’t own traveling with you.

I don’t own an AirTag.

I hit “Play Sound” the way the notification tells you to. A faint little chime came from the hallway—no, not the hallway. The chime came from inside my apartment, somewhere near the door. I turned on every light. The chime played again. I traced it to my coat hanging on a hook by the door. In the inner pocket, tucked into the lining, there was a small white circle the size of a coin.

I have never bought one. I don’t let friends hang coats here. I don’t even remember when I last wore that coat. I stood there too long with it in my hand, like if I crushed it the problem would be over. I didn’t crush it. I followed the instructions, disabled it, photographed it, emailed myself the serial.

At 1:40, three taps on the door. Not loud. Deliberate. I stood a foot back from the door and said, “I’m calling the police.”

The whisper came, so soft I wasn’t sure it was a voice: “I know.”

I called. T came with another officer. They took the AirTag. They took my statement. They were careful not to promise more than they could do. T said he’d push for a warrant for the owner information. He said, “If he’s dumb enough to register it in his own name, he’s dumb enough to make a mistake. Keep everything in writing. Don’t engage.”

The next morning, I was packing a bag. I’d decided to stay at Jonah’s for a while. The apartment felt wrong. That’s not a legal term or a useful descriptor, but it is the best I have. It felt like I had already been entered and cataloged, like a drawer someone had measured and closed again.

I took down the strip of tape over the peephole to check the lens for scratches. The tape was thicker than it looked. Manny had folded it in on itself to make it easy to peel. When I pulled it free, something fell with it—something tiny and silver, stuck to the adhesive. I bent to pick it up and realized I was holding a piece of polished metal no larger than my thumbnail: a peephole reverser. The kind you press to the lens to see inside. This one was the other half—flat, designed to stick to the door and act as an anchor for a magnetized viewer.

There was a faint ring around the peephole where someone had glued, then pulled off, something. I don’t know when he did it. Maybe the first night, when I opened the door and saw nothing and stepped forward into the hall for two seconds. Maybe the second. The idea that it had been there while I had spoken, while I had pressed my own eye to the lens—my stomach turned hard enough I had to put my hands on my knees.

I left. I took the cameras, the laptop, a duffel of clothes, and left. On my way out I saw three fresh gray marks at the height of my shoulder on the other side of the door frame. I didn’t wipe them.

Jonah’s place is a fourth-floor walk-up across town. He gave me the couch and made dumb jokes and ordered too much takeout. I wanted to be grateful. Mostly I listened for footsteps in the hall that never came. We put my door camera up facing his apartment entrance as a joke. It felt important once it was there.

Sunday afternoon T called. He said, careful and official, that they’d requested owner information tied to the AirTag serial. He also said that if I was leaving the apartment, I should let the super know, because if the person was targeting me specifically, they might follow. “Don’t post about it,” he said. “People escalate when you make them characters.”

I didn’t post. I didn’t tell the building group chat, either. I wanted to believe that changing location breaks a pattern.

That night, at 1:33, the camera by Jonah’s door recorded three even taps. You can see Jonah sit up in his sleeping bag on the floor in the living room and look at me on the couch. You can see us freeze. The knocks don’t come again. Ten minutes later, the camera records a single frame of motion: a dark shape too close to the lens to resolve. The motion sensor triggers an eight-second clip, but the frame after the first one is just the empty hall. Whatever passed in front of it did so almost against the lens.

We didn’t open the door. We didn’t sleep. At 4:20 the camera recorded something else: a folded piece of paper pushed under the door from outside with a stiff business card. On the paper, printed in neat block letters: YOU’RE DOING THIS WELL. THANK YOU.

T took the note. He dusted it. He told us, “Don’t respond. Don’t reward.” He said the note might be evidence of harassment. He said he’d ask for the building’s exterior cameras. He didn’t have good news. The exterior cams are fake; the landlord put up domes to deter package thieves and never wired them.

On Tuesday afternoon, Jonah went to work and I took a shower. When I came out, my phone had that same notification: Unknown device detected moving with you. I swore out loud, followed the chime, and found the AirTag in my backpack’s front pocket. The backpack had been in Jonah’s entry closet since I arrived.

We tore the closet apart. There was a hairline scratch around the inside of the knob plate so fine I would never have noticed it if I weren’t inches from it. Jonah hadn’t given anyone else a key. He swore he hadn’t. We believe him. I believe him. It doesn’t matter. The scratch is there. This man has a method for getting into places quietly, swiftly, and leaving no sign the casual eye would catch. Or he has a key for older knobs, or he’s very good with a pick. We changed the knob that night, because doing something felt like the only way to breathe.

Wednesday I went back to my apartment in daylight with Manny and two officers. We went through my stuff. Manny showed me the hinge pins on my door. You can tap them out from the hallway on older frames even if the door swings inward. Manny replaced them with security pins in fifteen minutes using parts he had in a plastic organizer. He said, almost apologetic, “Should’ve done these already.”

One of the officers, a woman with eyes that seemed to notice everything, pointed at the baseboard heater and then at a tiny hole drilled in the wall above it, at ankle level, behind where my shoe rack used to sit. The hole was the width of a drinking straw. There was nothing in it when she probed with a swab. She looked at me and didn’t say anything at first. Then: “You live alone. You keep your blinds shut. Someone wanted a vantage you wouldn’t think to cover.”

That night I slept at a motel with the security bar flipped over the knob and a chair under the handle because that’s what you do when you’ve run out of locks to buy. A family on the other side of the wall watched a show at a volume that would have driven me crazy any other week. The noise made me feel like there were witnesses. At 1:33 exactly, there were three taps on my door. That even, patient rhythm. I lay on the bed and looked at the ceiling and cried without sound like a dog who knows whimpering gets him smacked.

At 1:40 a folded piece of paper slid under the door and stopped against the rubber threshold. The paper was hotel stationary. I didn’t move. I waited for an hour and then opened the door to a hallway that was normal in the way a set is normal when you step behind it and it’s just plywood. I picked up the paper. YOU LEARN FAST.

The front desk had cameras. Real ones. The night manager showed the police the footage. At 1:21 a man in a baseball cap checked in with a card that processed. He carried no luggage. He walked to a room two doors down from mine. At 1:32 he walked out of that room, turned to my door, stood with his head tilted, and did not knock. The camera doesn’t have audio. After forty seconds he turned around and walked back to his room. At 3:10 he left without checking out. The card was prepaid and untraceable. The name was fake.

I moved in with a cousin an hour out of the city after that. I stopped going to my apartment except in the daytime with someone else. Manny sublet it to a student two months later. I didn’t want the deposit back. I didn’t want to stand in that hallway with the paisley carpet and explain why the strike plate had four giant screws.

There are things I could add that would make this sound like a story. I could tell you that two weeks later an apartment across the river was broken into at 1:30 a.m. and the woman who lived there woke up with someone standing in her doorway. That’s true. I could tell you that she described three light taps on her door in the nights before it happened. Also true. I could tell you that I got an email from an account with no name containing a single attachment: an eight-second clip of my living room from the angle of the peephole, me standing inside with a knife, my mouth moving as I asked through the door, “Can I help you?” That happened too. The file metadata was wiped. The email auto-deleted the day after I opened it.

T still texts sometimes. He checks in like a friend. He keeps it professional, reminds me not to post identifying details, not to tell a version that turns this man into a myth. “They read,” he told me once. “They get better.” He says they might have enough to get a warrant if the AirTag owner information connects to a human with an address. He doesn’t promise. I asked what he thinks the hand gesture meant—that slow circle, the three little lines. He stared at me a second and said, “Counting his nights. Or counting yours.”

I’ve bought things I never thought I’d own: a simple alarm system, two real door bars, window pins, a wedge that will break your foot if you kick it wrong. I sleep with my shoes by the bed and my wallet in my jeans pocket on the chair, because T said if you have to run, you should have your ID and keys. My cousin pretends to be annoyed at the extra deadbolt I paid to have installed on her door. When she goes to work, I check her peephole twice. There’s a piece of tape over it. Blue painter’s tape. I replace it every few days, like a ritual.

Sometimes, when I’m standing in her kitchen pouring coffee, I practice not reacting to imagined sounds. I count to three and make myself set the cup down and pick it up again, like I am rehearsing a movement the way he rehearsed his. Some days I hate that. Some days it makes me feel like I’m not only being acted upon.

If you live in an older building with a door that is mostly wood and a peephole that isn’t beveled from the inside, put tape over it. Replace the screws in your strike plate with longer ones. Set your phone to notify you about AirTags. It won’t stop someone with patience, but it will at least make you feel like you are a participant in your own life.

I’m writing this tonight because it’s quiet where I am, and because two hours ago I got a text from an unknown number. Just a photo. The photo is a blurry shot of a motel hallway with paisley carpet and a numbered door with a chair wedged under the handle from the inside. My chair. The timestamp is from months ago. The caption says: THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME PRACTICE.

I don’t know if he means practice getting in, or practice not knocking, or practice making people like me into a set of predictable responses. Maybe all of it. Maybe the point was to see how much of my life he could occupy by doing almost nothing at all. Three taps. A mark on wood. A little piece of metal you’d miss unless you knew to look.

It’s 1:29 now. I can hear the refrigerator motor, the distant hiss of a car on the highway, my own heartbeat in my throat. I’m going to put my phone on the table by the door and start a recording. I’m going to stand back from the peephole with the tape still on it, and I’m going to breathe. If there are three taps, I’m not going to open the door. If there aren’t, I’m still not going to open it.

If you’re reading this and thinking I’m feeding him by writing it down, you’re probably right. If you’re reading it because you’ve heard something at your door around the same time every night and you needed to know you’re not the only one keeping track of seconds in the dark, then I’m writing it for you, too.

Last time was pre-pandemic. I know everyone will recommend I eat Korean food but that is already something I will do for sure. I am looking for specific activities and areas I should visit. I'll list what I am looking to do:

1. Hiking-I love nature and walks so any recommendations will be great.

2. Skincare-any areas where I can purchase a lot of skincare products at great prices

3. Group tours-I want to meet people, so any fun group tours you have done before let me know!

4. Shopping-this is a big one. Any districts that is great for shopping clothes at affordable prices is what I'm looking for. I recently got introduced to Musinsa so any styles related to that is what I like to wear (think also HnM) Any Korean brands please recommend to me!

5. Cafe-I love coffee. I need to drink it every day. Any cute cafes are welcome. 

6. Street food (night time)-I know I already mentioned I will be eating a lot, but if you know a good district that has great street food, let me know for sure. I want to eat with my parents at night time specifically and drink soju etc etc. 

7. And lastly, any events that will be happening at the end of October (Halloween parties and clubs included LOL) I would also like to hear what's going down.

But recently I’ve started to think that this chronic lack of sleep has seriously affected me. 

So it goes beyond simply feeling exhausted.. I’ve been having a really short temper and experiencing memory blanks and brain fog. I go to work but then lack the motivation to work. My creativity, as well, seems to have disappeared. Even things I used to love, like reading or gaming, feel like a chore, and I am no longer able to enjoy hobbies. I originally started just blaming burnout and getting older. 

However, the problems have persisted even when I’ve switched to a lower intensity job and the only factor that has stayed the same is my poor sleep. I recently read some blogs about how sleep can affect your overall health pretty significantly. This can’t continue so I looked into options to fix my sleep and came across CBTI programs. The one that seems the most popular is Sleep Reset. I just started it and noticed that my sleep cycle is starting to get more regular. I’ve been tracking my sleep and learning about sleep cycles, circadian rhythms, and the idea of a “sleep reset”. I’ve started to notice my body had been stuck in a loop of bad habits, bad timing, and overstimulation at night.

It's tough to live in the thin walls of tightly-packed apartment buildings in Gent? Innocent humming and phone notifications of your coworkers drive you wild? No noise cancelling headphones are strong enough? Having to watch or hear someone eat is akin to torture? 

Me too! 

Would you be interested in getting together to form a small chat/friend group? It's strange to propose this, but then I was thinking: why shouldn't a friendship start with a shared complaint? And if we already have this in common, maybe we'll have other things in common too. So if you're looking to complain to someone who ""gets it"" the next time you're assaulted by innocent noise of your fellow citizens, DM me! My idea is to first form a WhatsApp group, then maybe progress to a coffee meetup, etc. if it's solid enough.

I believe this is how we make connections and friends and have a healthy social interactions.

This went on for the whole period of two years, saw her at least once a week. I could never gather the courage to talk to her, not even a hi. What if she thinks I’m a creep, what if it’s a no, what if the smiles turn to regrets, what if the good days after seeing her turn to awkwardly facing other way.
I could never ask her even her name(I know through other sources but still…)
When I left the company, it was a regret of course but it still felt good not getting a rejection outta nowhere.

I went a couple times there (Third wave coffee), saw her again and still the blushing smiles and good but piercing memories of nothingness.

I wish she enjoys a good life and good luck to her.

Enjoy an action packed weekend of racing across three disciplines that will test the competitors' skills. A Sprint Race is a type of jet ski race focused on speed and agility, typically involving short, fast courses marked by buoys, according to Yahoo Sports. These races emphasize quick acceleration and maneuverability, showcasing the rider's ability to navigate tight turns and straightaways efficiently. Closed Course racing is currently the most popular competition in the Personal Watercraft racing community. Closed Course allows competitors to line up on a single starting line and then compete on a tight course made up of multiple buoys. Competitors will navigate a closed course composed of right and left-hand turns. In slalom racing competitors navigate a multi-buoy zig-zag course of left and right-hand turns. The final position is based on the fastest track time. Typically, a ten-second penalty is given per missed buoy unless the rider navigates back and correctly completes the turn. Competitors in a freestyle event will execute a routine displaying acrobatic and aerial tricks. Each competitor will receive two minutes to perform a routine showcasing their skills for the audience and a panel of judges. Food will be available for purchase. Spectators are encouraged to bring their own chairs and/or tents to watch. Gates open at 9:00 AM and the racing starts shortly after both days of the event.  
*Note: The $7.00 per vehicle state park parking fee still applies for this event.*

David Parmley began his musical career at age 15 and by the time he turned 17, he began his full time career as a member of The Bluegrass Cardinals. That band featured his father, Don Parmley, and three Los Angeles musicians. In 1975 they made their way to the Washington DC area and began performing several nights a week for several years. David’s lead and baritone voice was the backbone to The Cardinal sound. Dozens of musicians have worked with David and Don over the years but “The Sound” remained constant. The Bluegrass Cardinals recorded dozens of projects during their 25 year run. The material is considered the finest to come out of the 70s and 80s bluegrass era. David left The Bluegrass Cardinals in the 90’s to pursue a solo career. After taking some time off, David Parmley has returned to bluegrass music with a new renewed spirit.

1mr4hzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1mr4hzx/just_need_advicehelp/,Just need advice/help,"To preface, I have no insurance and I'm living paycheck to paycheck. 

I (42 f) was diagnosed in November/December 2023. 6.8 and I knew it was coming, runs in family. Put on Farxiga and then lost my insurance in April/May of 2024. I not only lost my diabetes meds, but all my mental health meds and therapy as well. (I have borderline personality disorder and anxiety/depression). 
I also lost my mom in July of 2024 and my cat two weeks later. So it's been a ride. 

I quit caring. Ate whatever and all that jazz. I'm a picky eater, always have been so I always ate freezer and processed food. My whole life basically. Every now and then I'd eat a nice meat and potatoes dinner, but...

I work overnights through the week and sleep normal time over the weekends. 
However, sleep is something I don't always do well so sometimes I sleep a lot or not good at all.

I decided to check my BS for the first time since last year on the 7th at work around 12:10am ... It was 257 and all I had was my coffee (milk and sugar) and half a mountain dew.
So immediately I was like, crap. I'm there now and need to do better. I started freaking out and quit coffee, the crazy carbs, sweets, etc. Just for this week, I ate tuna salad on two  high fiber small tortillas (whole wheat bread was making my bs go crazy), cheese cubes, mandarin orange. Snack was granny smith (half) and peanut butter. Celery and PB, as well. For breakfast food, 3 eggs (either scrambled or I did an omelette with a few slices of turkey and shredded cheese - I was going to try spinach, but I'm working myself up to it. Lol) and 2 small sausage patties and a mandarin orange, with a few sips of 1% milk. 

I've also been drinking cucumber water like crazy.

Now my spikes vary, some just goes up 26 and then the same meal the next day might be 40 points up. I don't know. But since I run high anyhow, it goes to 230ish. I've only been over 250 twice, the first time with the coffee, pop, and sugar/milk and then the next was when I woke up one night. I wake up at around 9pm after going to bed around 11am-12pm and I usually have issues sleeping. Sometimes I wake earlier. 
The last few nights I wake, my bs was in the 190s. The few days before that it was 170/180s (but I have been on my monthly and that started Tuesday night and that's when I noticed the 190s/200s the last few nights). 

I know fiber and protein, and no starches for now. I drink tea now but one does have a small amount of caffeine because the headaches have been brutal. I did also quit smoking June 9 of this year, after smoking for almost 28 years. 

I am also going to be getting my teeth pulled and dentures at some point next month, I do have gum disease and infection in my gums and that has been going on for many many months  and have been on amoxicillin this week. I heard that can raise bs too? 

So I guess my main thing is I cannot go to the doc right now, so I'm trying to help this myself. I'm not active but have been trying to do small exercises that I can do in my living room after eating. I am 5'5 and 190lbs so definitely need to lose weight. Most of my weight is in my belly, I look pregnant all the time, so I was told possible cortisol issues by other folks. 

I've been researching and researching and getting so overwhelmed. I just would like some food ideas and should I eat certain things at certain times? With me working overnights, I usually eat when I get to work and then snack a few hours later and then breakfast when I get home, but wondering if I should be doing something different. 

I also noticed my fasting bs while being awake is lower than my fasting when I wake up, same amount of hours. Is this the dawn phenomenon? Does that even work in the evenings? Lol. 

I noticed also that my bs takes forever to go back down. It's usually 230 or less at the two hours after eating and slowly goes back down to 180/190.

Thanks for reading and sorry for rambling. I'm battling a headache from heck right now and just over everything. I'm hoping maybe after my dental work and stuff, it might help my bs and then I can eventually get back to the doctor in case I do need meds regardless. ",1,1755278998.0,diabetes_t2,1,0.67,False
1mr4hju,https://www.reddit.com/r/thestatesofmind/comments/1mr4hju/how_i_quit_adderall_and_kept_my_productivity/,How I quit Adderall and kept my productivity,"Recently, we came across a story in an online community that stood out for its raw honesty. We spoke with the author, as well as a few specialists, to understand what helped him move from addiction back to stability while keeping his productivity intact. Here’s what we learned.

The author started taking Adderall for ADHD. At first, it helped him stay productive, but eventually it turned into an unmanageable addiction, leading to bizarre and risky behavior, psychosis, and paranoia. At one point, he bought a vintage \\$4,000 leather jacket, rented a Porsche Carrera, spent a huge amount of money in an online casino, and opened multiple bank accounts, convinced that his family wanted to rob him.

The problem was, he couldn’t afford the two-week rehab program recommended at the hospital but still needed to keep his productivity level high. He went straight to a local NA group, where they suggested a psychiatrist and a couple of online communities. According to the author, without that advice he might have ended up jobless or even homeless. If these steps helped him get back on track and maintain his pace, he hopes they can help others too.

1. Rely only on your body. Coffee, matcha, sugar-rich foods, Adderall — all give only a short-term boost and leave you helpless when they wear off. Your body, with its natural resources, is your best ally. Think of it as a battery you can expand. Here’s what helped him build that capacity.

2. Know your limits. This applies to every part of life, especially work. Overworking without realizing it drains you and leads straight to burnout. Before taking on one more task your manager insists on, check in with your body first.

3. Remove anything addictive. Addiction — whether substances, social media, sex, porn, or even excessive gym training — drains your energy. The author had a combination of social media and sex/porn, thinking they helped him “reboot,” but in reality they were just wasting dopamine. Quitting was tough, but focus and presence improved dramatically.

4. Start the morning with a body scan meditation. No coffee, no shower — just sitting still, breathing, and scanning the body from toes to head, letting thoughts pass by. It was effective from the first try, even when he thought he was doing it “wrong.” (Here’s a link to the practice [https://statesofmind.com/a-calm-way-to-reconnect-short-body-scan-meditation-for-adhd/](https://statesofmind.com/a-calm-way-to-reconnect-short-body-scan-meditation-for-adhd/))

5. Return to the present moment when unfocused. Breathwork or pressing his feet into the floor works well.

6. Wake up with gentle movement. Instead of snoozing, he does small in-bed exercises — eye movements, wrist twists, slow “bicycle” legs — before getting up. Over time, adding gym, yoga, or other activity grew his energy capacity.

7. Prioritize sleep timing over duration. A sleep clinic helped him find his “sweet spot,” and going to bed at the right time made more difference than sleeping longer.

8. Use CBT tools. A 5-step thought check was key: write the thought, list facts for/against, craft a balanced reframe, rate feeling, take one step, and re-rate.

9. Minimize distractions. Turn off notifications or put a “Do Not Disturb” sign on the door when working.

10. Have a clear plan. Write down steps for when feeling unfocused, drained, or tempted to use again.

It’s been two months since he quit Adderall. In the early days, his work performance dipped, but within a few weeks, it returned to normal — and even improved. His psychiatrist switched him to bupropion and clonidine for ADHD, and he still attends NA meetings.

1mr4h0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1mr4h0b/28m_had_a_conflict_with_someone_23f_i_have/,[28M] Had a conflict with someone [23F] I have feelings feelings for them,"So here's a long one but bear with me, there's this person that we've been hanging out for like 4 months, I caught feelings for her and we started hanging out everyday as ""best friends"" (as she claims when I confronted her about the mixed signals I receive from her)

we shared almost everything about our lives, traumas and everything we might have been ashamed of, her history included a lot of drugs, random hook-ups , a lot of sex , a lot of intimacy cravings, and she asked me if I got feelings for her, I said yes she said she appreciated the honesty, one day we went to a concert together it was nice, at the end of it we had a little talk and she admitted that she liked me too but it won't work out due to some reasons on her side regarding me working long times away from home

she has a diagnosed BPD (as she says) , she went to therapy for a couple of weeks and she stopped due to financial reasons and said that her doctors were always postponing her sessions, god knows the man I've tried to be and the support I tried to to give to this fuckass of a woman, she was struggling financially, I tried to help her , I helped with her rent, I got her a job, I took her out everyday cause I know she didn't have any money, I beared with a lot of crashing out and major disrespect for the stupidest of reasons like ""I'm bored , the weather is too hot, this place irritates me"" (which she blamed me for , telling me that I'm the one who initiates  and triggers such behavior) 

a week ago we were talking over the phone and she seemed upset about her life, I tried to intervene and talk to her into it , she crashed the fuck out on me while going an extra mile to mention some stuff that I told her about me in a moment of truth and heart fullness , she used that against me by telling me that I can't even help myself, how can I help her in the most fucking maniac way of yelling I've ever heard so I decided not to talk, we hung up, she tried calling once and I didn't answer, 

I remained silent for about 5 days, no contact, she texted me if we're gonna talk about it , I was like It's funny that you're not here to apologize, she said she don't feel like she's in the wrong and accused me of being delusional, invading her boundaries, we agreed to cut each others off because we're simply different and after a moment of silence she said she wanted to give me my hoodie back, I was like you can keep it, I don't think I'll need or use it... then BANG! 
She went full nuclear on me , calling me out, told me to stay depressed in my room, told me that I'm afraid of her rejection, telling me that I go crazy over her if she doesn't reply quickly, calling me a coward because I reply in total coldness toward her explosion, but here's the dealbreaker , she said she regrets ""enduring me for loving her and for actually telling her that I loved her""  a bunch of other things lmao

Little later she told me that she hates taking initiatives and every time we fight (because of her going batshit on me for absolutely nothing I've done) and she feels like she's always the one taking the first step toward making things right.....so I had enough, I held my fists tight, raised my chest up , told her that it's normal to take an initial move after you know you've done someone bad then called that woman out on every single fucking thing she did to me while knowing that I didn't deserve any of that and her response was mind-blowing ...""So If I'm that bad of a person why are you choosing to be my friend?"" 
I was like ""I think I'm the one who's supposed to ask that question, based on the facts that you said regarding me bringing out the worst of you, making you yell, shout and scream"" she quickly changed subjects and went into telling me that she thinks this whole matter isn't a big of a deal to cut each other off (after she said she wanted us to be gone from each others life)

After that she said she wanted us to meet to ""talk about this"" and we can't do it over the phone...I was like, okay, I actually went to meet her in a coffee shop
As she walked in and the casual greets, I asked her so , you wanna jump into the conversation or should we wait a while? Because we're supposed to be here for a meaningful talk

Boy shit didn't go right we had a little talk about things in life that lasted for a minute and she was like ""You know actually I thought I wanted to talk but when I came and saw your face, I feel like I don't wanna, you won't get it, you'll never get it as usual, I have to talk about the same thing over a thousand times for you to get it""

I'm like okay, guess this isn't what I came for, told her I'll have my coffee and leave

Shit went so bad she crashed out on me in the shop, she was like ""YOU THINK I DESERVED THIS FROM YOU? TO STOP TALKING TO ME FOR 5 DAYS?"" 

I watched her crash out in silence, told her that none of us deserved any of this, but this didn't end up with nothing but her crying and deciding that we shouldn't be friends anymore as her argument was that I tried to break a ""boundary"" she set and she didn't deserve that I remain silent for 5 days as I was supposed to make an excuse for her then she went on like ""You also do stupid shit sometimes and I allow it because I love you and I know you didn't mean it"" I told her that I understand she might have felt bad about that but I also felt bad about what she said and none of us deserved that,  

as I began to speak about how compromised I felt when she started mentioning stuff that she shouldn't mention, she started tearing up and went outside for a smoke, I went to check on her and she was like ""I need some time alone"" I did keep my distance, we went back in she apologized , we shook hands , started crying , I refused to leave until she's okay, she insisted on me leaving and told me that her ex used to do the same thing and what I'm doing will lead to nowhere
I replied to that by firstly asking her why is she bringing her ex in this? Then telling ber that this is the right thing , the thing any man should do and this is normal, what am I gonna get for acting right in a situation that requires me to do so? I don't want anything from you, she said that I'm breaking her boundaries again, so I left...


last night I sent her these texts because this is what I've felt

""As something you know about me, I try to talk out my feelings a lot, I miss you and I don't miss you right now, I've tried calling you yesterday to check on you but it was kinda hard after the fact that you told me that you don't even wanna be friends , But after not so many thoughts I did what I feel and this is what I'm doing right now I've missed you ever since the day I decided not to talk, but I had to stop, it's not fair that you'd expect me to put out an excuse for you that you didn't mean shit while you didn't see me as a friend who's trying to help both of us felt bad by the actions we've taken and even if my words felt dull , I still feel like something is missing in my day, I've felt a lot of things during the time we hanged out together, I've felt anger, I've felt empathy, I've felt life, I've felt love , It felt like life has meant something to wake up for, to check on, to wait for , this is probably me pouring out all my feelings, but if we don't ever talk again, I believe that I shouldn't hold in any words unsaid, I'm sorry if I hurt you in anyway by my impulsive reaction nature ""

and I kinda woke up feeling stupid that I did that when I realized that I was still being genuine, and this could be a part of her guilt-tripping plan , she hasn't replied but I know she saw them, on the other hand I feel like I've shared my feelings completely and there's nothing left inside toward that person except some nice memories, some good jokes, some deep talks, some long walks, and a couple of vibrant feelings, I do wanna talk to the person but I also feel like I should let her go at this point when I noticed that I'm beginning to lose my self-respect, my self-image, my energy, sanity and the experience of being in the real world,

I share the upstairs and a bathroom with one roommate (UR), who clearly wishes she didn’t have roommates and acts like the rest of us are intruding in her private apartment.

Common spaces: She refuses to let us put any furniture upstairs because she wants a “minimalist entryway,” so there’s no couch, table, or seating. Downstairs (half the size) is the only space she’ll allow for a living room. All decor must be gray or black. No color allowed or she’ll physically remove it. We had an argument a while back because she threw out my fridge magnets without informing me. I’d been collecting them as mementos from my travels since I was a kid.

Bathroom: She says my products “ruin the aesthetic” and puts them in a bag at my door. Her stuff takes all the cabinet space (and there’s way more of it). She knocks if I’m in there more than a few minutes but spends 2 hours daily doing makeup. Complains my 6 a.m. shower wakes her up, yet she showers and blow-dries after midnight when she knows I have to wake up for work very early. Her idea of a compromise is that I shower at the gym instead of at home. 

Noise: Says my steps, closing my door, and feeding my dog are “loud,” but she blasts music, yells on the phone, and slams cabinets and doors. I swear it’s worse because she won’t allow furniture or decor to absorb sound.

Kitchen: Her coffee setup takes up 70% of the counter and 80% of the freezer. Claimed the largest cabinet for her dishes only. Flips if anything else ends up there. Remember she’s a “minimalist” so she barely even has any dishes to fill up half the cabinet. It’s more like a display. 

Other issues: Won’t clean shared spaces, refuses to chip in for cleaning supplies, takes over a month to pay utilities, never takes out the trash or brings the bins back in, and leaves Amazon boxes in the living room until someone else breaks them down. If maintenance needs to be done, refuses to be the one to let them in and has made some of us take off work so she doesn’t have to be the one to stay home and wait for them to finish, even though she’s not working. She’s also rude and unwelcoming to our guests but brings strangers over for hookups at least twice a week.

## Key Features Analysis

The right display case can make all the difference in showcasing your goods and maintaining quality.

**Temperature Control:** Precisely regulating the internal temperature is crucial for preserving the textures and flavors of pastries.

Modern pastry display cases typically offer digital temperature controls, enabling precise adjustment and monitoring. A consistent temperature range, generally between 36°F and 41°F (2°C to 5°C), is vital for preventing bacterial growth and maintaining the freshness of items like cream fillings and delicate toppings.Some high-end models incorporate dual-zone temperature control, allowing separate temperature settings for different types of pastries, ensuring each product is kept at its ideal preservation conditions. alarm systems that activate when the temperature deviates from the set range further safeguard the quality of your inventory.

**Humidity Control:** Managing humidity is just as crucial as temperature.

Too much humidity can cause pastries to become soggy, while too little can dry them out. Optimal humidity levels typically range from 60% to 70% for most pastries. some advanced display cases feature built-in humidity control systems that automatically maintain the ideal surroundings.These systems usually work by either adding moisture to the air or removing excess moisture, depending on the specific needs of the pastries being displayed. Proper humidity management is notably critically important for items such as croissants, which need to retain their flaky texture, and cakes with delicate icings.

**Lighting:** Effective lighting is essential to showcase the vibrant colors and intricate details of your pastries, attracting customers and driving sales.

LED lighting is increasingly popular in pastry display cases due to its energy efficiency, long lifespan, and ability to produce luminous, consistent light. Opt for display cases that offer adjustable lighting, allowing you to customize the brightness and colour temperature to best complement your pastries. Some models also feature individual shelf lighting, ensuring that each tier is equally illuminated.Proper lighting not onyl enhances the visual appeal of your pastries but also creates an inviting and professional presentation.**Shelving and Display Options:** Versatility in shelving configurations allows you to adapt the display case to accommodate various sizes and shapes of pastries.

Adjustable shelves are a standard feature in most modern pastry display cases, enabling you to customize the spacing between tiers to accommodate different product heights. Some models take this a step further, offering slanted shelves that provide better visibility and allow for more creative product arrangements. rotating shelves are also available, which can automatically showcase all sides of your pastries, catching the eye of potential customers.Consider the weight capacity of the shelves to ensure they can safely support heavier items such as cakes or multi-tiered pastries.

**Materials and Durability:** The materials used in the construction of a pastry display case play a significant role in its durability, aesthetics, and ease of maintenance.

Stainless steel is a popular choice for exterior panels,known for its resistance to corrosion and ease of cleaning. Tempered glass is typically used for the display windows,offering enhanced strength and safety in case of breakage.The interior components may be constructed from a combination of stainless steel and food-grade plastics, ensuring that they are safe for contact with food products. When selecting a pastry display case, prioritize models that use high-quality materials and solid construction techniques to ensure long-lasting performance and reliability.

**accessibility and Maintenance:** Ease of use and maintenance are critical factors in the day-to-day operation of a pastry display case.

Features such as sliding doors or easily removable shelves can simplify restocking and cleaning. Look for models with self-closing doors, which help to maintain consistent temperature and reduce energy consumption. A removable drip tray is another useful feature, making it easier to collect and dispose of any spills or condensation. Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential for keeping your pastry display case in optimal condition, so choose a model that offers easy access to all components and is simple to sanitize.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality pastry display case offers several significant advantages that directly impact your business's success.

**Increased Sales:** By presenting your pastries in an attractive and well-lit environment, you significantly increase their appeal to customers. A visually appealing display encourages impulse purchases, leading to higher sales volumes. Numerous studies have shown that well-designed displays can increase sales by up to 20-30% compared to poorly presented items. An attractive display case acts as a silent salesperson, drawing customers' attention and tempting them with the visual allure of your pastries.

**Extended Shelf Life:** Proper temperature and humidity control provided by a high-quality display case significantly extends the shelf life of your pastries. This reduces waste and minimizes financial losses due to spoilage. Such as, a cake stored at room temperature might last only a day or two before becoming stale, while the same cake stored in a controlled pastry display case can remain fresh and flavorful for up to five days. This extended shelf life not only saves you money but also ensures that your customers are always receiving the freshest possible products.

**Enhanced Brand Image:** A sleek and professional pastry display case enhances your overall brand image, conveying a sense of quality and attention to detail. Customers are more likely to perceive your pastries as higher quality when they are displayed in a modern and well-maintained case. A consistent and visually appealing presentation reinforces your brand identity and helps you stand out from the competition. Investing in a high-quality display case is an investment in your brand's reputation and perceived value.**Reduced Food Waste:** By maintaining optimal storage conditions,pastry display cases minimize the risk of spoilage and waste. This reduces the cost of ingredients and labor, ultimately improving your bottom line. Regular monitoring of temperature and humidity levels allows you to make timely adjustments, preventing pastries from drying out or becoming soggy. Effective display case management can lead to a significant reduction in food waste, contributing to both environmental sustainability and financial savings.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions from customers can provide clarity and build confidence in your purchasing decision.

**What is the ideal temperature range for a pastry display case?**
The ideal temperature range for a pastry display case typically falls between 36°F and 41°F (2°C to 5°C). This range helps to maintain the freshness and quality of most pastries while preventing bacterial growth. However, some delicate items, such as those with cream fillings, may benefit from slightly lower temperatures within this range.

**How often should I clean my pastry display case?**
Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining hygiene and preventing the buildup of bacteria and mold. It's recommended to clean the interior of your pastry display case at least once a week, using a mild detergent and warm water. The exterior should be wiped down daily to remove fingerprints and smudges.Additionally,any spills or debris should be cleaned up promptly to prevent cross-contamination.

**Can I use any cleaning products on my pastry display case?**

Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasives, or solvents, as these can damage the surfaces of the display case or contaminate the pastries.Always follow the manufacturer's instructions when cleaning your display case, and ensure that all cleaning products are thoroughly rinsed off before restocking the pastries.

**What should I do if my pastry display case isn't holding its temperature?**
If your pastry display case isn't holding its temperature, first check that the temperature settings are correct and that the unit is properly plugged in. Next, inspect the door seals to ensure they are clean and airtight. If the problem persists, it could be a sign of a more serious issue, such as a faulty compressor or thermostat. In this case, it's best to contact a qualified refrigeration technician for repair.

1mr4adz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mr4adz/does_the_breville_vertuoplus_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the Breville VertuoPlus Coffee Maker Truly Elevate Your Espresso Experience?,"Honestly, I wasn’t sure if the Breville BNV420GRY1BUC1 was going to live up to the hype. But after using it practically every morning, I’ve got some thoughts, both good and not-so-good. As someone who lives for efficient coffee-making (read: I’m not functional without a morning brew), this machine has been a game-changer, but it’s not without its quirks.

**Stylish and Practical Design**  
One of my favorite things about this espresso machine is its sleek, modern design. The grey finish complements my kitchen's minimalist vibe, and it doesn't take up a ton of counter space despite its functionality. The 40-ounce removable water tank is genius, too. It swivels so I can place it in different positions based on my counter setup, which is perfect since my workspace is weirdly narrow. Cleaning isn’t a pain either, since the used pods container can hold up to 10 capsules before it needs emptying. More time sipping, less time dealing with trash—yes, please.

**Even My Kids Find It Easy to Use**  
Okay, I’ll confess that my teenage son (who loves iced coffee) figured out how to use this faster than I did. The one-touch operation is intuitive, and with Centrifusion technology, brewing feels like magic. Each coffee pod is scanned, and the machine adjusts its brewing parameters accordingly. Even when half-asleep, I can trust it to deliver consistent coffee or espresso. Out of curiosity, we’ve brewed five-ounce, eight-ounce, single, and double espresso options. Hot, iced—you name it, it can do it. It practically caters to my entire family’s caffeine quirks.

**Positives**  
This machine definitely has its strong points:

- Heats up incredibly fast; it's ready to go in about 20 seconds.
- Energy-saving mode shuts off automatically, which I appreciate because no one in my house remembers to switch things off.  
- Coffee tastes wonderfully rich, and the crema is top-notch.  
- The starter set of Nespresso capsules was such a nice bonus; it's like getting a sampler pack to find your go-to flavors.  

[Don’t miss Breville BNV420GRY1BUC1 deals—check Amazon here.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b01n13vkqn/)

**Drawbacks**  
Of course, all products have their quirks, and this espresso machine is no exception:

- While the pods are convenient, waste generation is a concern. I wish recycling them was simpler.  
- Even though the machine is compact, some people might find the water tank size limiting if they brew multiple drinks daily.  
- It’s a little on the noisy side when brewing. Not obnoxious, but noticeable, especially during quiet mornings.  

**How It Stacks Up Against Competitors**  
If you’re considering alternatives, the Keurig line comes to mind as a major competitor. While Keurig machines also offer single-serve convenience, they lack Breville’s Centrifusion technology, which really elevates the brewing experience and taste. Drip-style coffee lovers might gravitate toward that brand, but for espresso and high-quality crema, Breville dominates. Another option is the De’Longhi Dedica, which delivers premium espresso in small spaces. However, the VertuoPlus feels more user-friendly and versatile for different coffee styles, making it better suited for families or multi-coffee drinkers.  

**Value for Money**  
Is this coffee maker worth the price? I’d argue yes, for the most part. The dual functionality of brewing espresso and coffee, paired with its reliability and sleek design, makes it an excellent option compared to other machines in its category. The machine feels premium, and the customization options (cup sizes, complexity) justify the investment if coffee is a big part of your life. However, recurring costs like the Nespresso pods do add up, so it's worth weighing the trade-off between convenience and cost.

1mr4a6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mr4a6u/should_you_get_the_best_water_boiler_zojirushi/,Should You Get the Best Water Boiler Zojirushi CD-LFC50 Today,"If you're someone like me who cannot function without the comfort of a perfectly brewed cup of tea or coffee, then the Zojirushi CD-LFC50 Panorama Window Micom Water Boiler adds an effortless luxury to your daily routine. This sleek white boiler with a 169-ounce capacity is not only practical but also quite the stylish countertop companion. After using it daily for a couple of months, I’ve gathered more than a few impressions—some good ones, along with a sprinkle of aspects to reflect on.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this water boiler caught my attention right away. Its polished white finish adds a clean, modern touch to any kitchen, and at just over 13 inches tall, it sits comfortably on my countertop without being intrusive. The Panorama Window is an absolute highlight, as the clear water level gauge makes it incredibly easy to monitor how much water is left. Functionality aside, the compact build paired with a removable cord is a thoughtful touch for those who value convenience and neat spaces. The six-pound weight ensures it’s solid but not cumbersome to move around. I’ve found it easy to clean thanks to its nonstick interior—a lifesaver for anyone like me who dreads spending extra time scrubbing appliances.

**Temperature Performance and Versatility**  
What really sells this product is its micro-computerized temperature control. It comes with four temperature settings—160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F—customized for different types of tea and coffee. I didn’t realize how much I needed precise temperature settings until I started using this. Green tea lovers in the family have been thrilled with the 175°F option, while I personally favor the 195°F for my French press coffee routine. One standout feature is the Quick Temp mode, which heats water up to certain temperatures without boiling—a small but fantastic option when you’re in a rush.

[Check Zojirushi CD-LFC50 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b0166od6j0/)

**Energy-Saving Features**  
One detail I appreciate, given how often I use it, is the energy-saving timer mode. This feature lets you set it to start warming water 6–10 hours later, which means I can wake up to hot water all ready for my coffee. It’s a thoughtful addition for anyone trying to cut down energy bills while enjoying the convenience of hot water without the wait.

**Benefits**  
- **Multiple Temperature Settings:** Adapts to the needs of various tea or coffee types.  
- **Quick Temp Mode:** Saves time when only warm water is required.  
- **Panorama Water Window Gauge:** Clear and precise water level monitoring.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- **Size Limitation:** While it’s perfect for a family, single-person households may find the 169-ounce capacity excessive.  
- **Swivel Base Caution:** The swivel base is convenient for serving, but I found it a bit slippery on my smooth countertop.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Operating this boiler is refreshingly simple. Whether it’s the straightforward controls or the café drip mode for slower dispensing, everything feels effortless. The descaling mode deserves special mention as it keeps the interior sparkling clean with minimal effort on my end—something I feel is often overlooked in other models. Maintenance has never been so uncomplicated for me. Anyone who’s struggled with mineral buildup in traditional kettles will appreciate how Zojirushi designed a product to counter that with minimal stress.

**Competitors**  
Comparing this water boiler to some alternatives, there are a few points worth mentioning. Against cheaper electric kettles commonly found on the market, the Zojirushi stands miles ahead regarding precision and consistency. Products like the Tiger PDU-A50U-K or Cuisinart’s CPK-17 electric kettle hit the market with similar features, including variable temperature settings. However, I’ve noticed they either lack the Quick Temp functionality or don’t have the advanced insulation, which keeps water hot longer without overusing energy. On the flip side, the Tiger model might feel sturdier, but it doesn’t have the same user-friendly maintenance features.

**Value for Money**  
Even though the price tag might initially make you raise an eyebrow, the combination of quality, durability, and functionality ensures that the product lives up to its investment. With added perks like energy efficiency and the versatility to cater to diverse beverages, it strikes a sweet balance between luxury and practicality. I’ve tried cheaper options in the past, and while they worked okay for a time, none offered the long-term reliability and thoughtful design this water boiler provides.

And all I get told is that they spent that month getting to know one another. HUH?

What happened to showing these conversations? To showing characters enjoying each other's company or sharing their worries or pasts or their passions? To deepening the connection between them and showing off that wonderful chemistry they supposedly have? Or at the very least, seeing them react to one another. 

Now all I get is a few flacid paragraphs about how they had a conversation or did something together and they really enjoyed it and learned so much about one another. Or even worse *nothing*. It feels so shallow and lazy. It's like authors forgot that it's not just the characters that have to fall in love with one another; the read has to as well!

I'm not expecting authors to document everything the characters do together but I want something more than a few measly paragraphs while the characters are still getting to know one another. Is that too much to ask?",22,1755278073.0,ReverseHarem,10,1.0,False

Solo Summer Hike and Camp !
Harvested hoof fungus (Fomes fomentarius) and ignited it with frensel lens.
You can transport a coal this way, keeping it for hours.
But the forest was far too dry to risk dropping an ember on that flammable ground, so I put it out.
After some uphill bushwhacking, I drawed my machete type blade to carve a way through the thick ferns.
I then (off camera) reignited the fungus, and looked for an empty tuna can.
Didn't have to look far, sadly.
I transferred the ember into the rusty can, but the can crumbled under my might.
Too much power, I tell you.
I then picked up another tuna can, 10 meters away from the first.
It is a readily avaible resource in these lands.
Transferred the ember into the can to transport it safely.
Then I set up camp.
You might recognize this camp from earlier : it is!
I lost my Silky Pocketboy, so I went to look for it last place I seen it.
Properly speaking, camp was just laying a bivy bag onto my backpack, and making a fireplace with some rocks. No shelter is the best for me.
Speaking of fire, how I did it:
Cleared the area of pine needles.
Used a heavy rock as back wall.
Sand ground (no peat!).
Rocks around.
Wood stove on top of a flat rock .
Flat rock will absorb most of the heat.
This is to prevent root fires.
Started the fire... I actually didn't start the fire!
It started itself.
I put the fungus embers onto the stove, drop the pine needles that I removed from the fire area on top of the ember.
Took some pictures of the forming smoke and... it lit itself, no work from my part.
Added some twigs to it, enjoyed a beautiful night under the stars.
When flames turned into a coal bed, I put some sweet potatoes to bake overnight.
Slept well (maybe 5 hours?), got up at like 5 in the morning.
Potatoes were 90% baked.
Relit the fire.
This time using ferrorod on various barks collected on the trail, directly on the path,.
Already processed by hundreds of stomps.
While flames were building up (to make coals to cook breakfast on) I brewed some coffee.
Once I got coals, cooked merguez on a grate, ate, and hiked home!

have a kitchen aid semi auto espresso machine, an oxo burr grinder and i have a coffee scale.

I used to have good coffee the first few times would brew, but now I get SUPER low output. I've changed my grind size from (fine to coarse) anywhere between 1-9, with 2 intermediate clicks per number,

I don't have a distributor, but I do tap it several times before i tamp it. i dont see a crazy amount of channeling.

Im looking for some support, im really stressed and concerned about an upcoming barium swallow test i have to do.

Story (M24)
--------------------
Late may i started having a globus sensation in my throat, it was faint and not really bothering my day to day, so much so i actually thought it was caused by poor posture. It would come and go and so i really thought nothing of it. Then it evolved into dysphagia.

I had a really BAD habit of eating alot before bed and not allowing my body to digest the food properly, i never remember getting symptoms during the day. I also really enjoyed my spicy food and soda. But diet recently has completely shifted for the better.

Fast forward to now after a emergency room visit, visit with my doctor im now on a PPI twice a day, (morning and night) since tuesday august 5th and have had a significant increase in my symptoms. Its not fully gone but i feel significantly better symptoms wise then prior to taking the medication

Despite all of this i have a barium swallow test upcoming and im extremely scared/anxious about what the results could indicate and my mind is catastrophizing the worst scenarios. Im scared and praying for myself and everyone. 

Since the 5th i have drastically changed my diet amd behavior,

• I no longer lay down after eating and instead wait 1-2 hours before i do
• I completely cut out sodas,coffee, juices
• I cut out high sodium foods, Spicy foods and processed foods
• I eat smaller meals


Im feeling better but im still nervous, anxious about my test. To the point i wanna cry. Its scary. Does anyone have advice? Thank you for reading this ❤️

The route has good signage throughout, didn't have to look at the GPS too much. A lot of gravel forest paths/singletrack on the first day, which was rough going on my 25mm tyres and slowed me down. Second day was little country roads with few and courteous motorists who gave lots of overtaking room, and dedicated cycle paths, a couple of little climbs but nothing crazy. Last day was a beautiful asphalt cycle path straight to Dieppe.

I stayed in campsites and ate from local bakeries and farms, although I had a stove with me for emergency dehydrated meals and morning coffee.

They told me new products are officially launching next Thursday, then went into the back and brought out the Pumpkin Spice Latte shower gel and Pumpkin Spice body spray and said I could purchase today if I wanted to! Also picked up Harvest Moon, which smells (and looks) amazing. 

Interestingly, the Pumpkin Spice spray lists ginger as a note and the shower gel doesn’t, but I swear there’s a ginger note in the shower gel somewhere. I’m excited to test out the SG, it’s got roasted cocoa extract and coffee absolute in it! I find the SGs morph when you add water, which brings out all the nuances. Ginger is quite dominant note in the spray but it’s a very realistic pumpkin spice scent. I think I’ll probably only use it between October and December because it’s such a season specific smell.

My PhD defense is next week (medical sciences) and we’re capped at 20 minutes for the presentation. I keep running over the limit, and I’m pretty sure the chair will cut me off if I go long.

Does anyone have strategies for cutting down talk time without sacrificing the main message? Also, any general tips for the defense day itself would be amazing.

1mr3qp4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mr3qp4,Question about Out of Date Redemption Cards,"Hey all! I recently opened/ripped a box of 1997 Bowman CHL Hockey cards. I like the look and design and there are several players who made the NHL later on. Plus it was around $30, so it is just a fun one for me and gives me some additions to my PC. In addition to completing the entire base set (woohoo!), I pulled 3 redemption cards: 2 regular Bowman's Best and 1 Bowman's Best Refractor. And I was kinda bummed that I have those and not the cards they could have been.



But I remembered seeing several posts on Reddit, in various subs, about people sending in old redemption cards and some companies still honoring them or sending something back as a nice gesture. I feel like most of the posts I have seen have been about Panini or Upper Deck. I do not remember many ones about Topps, and I definitely do not remember any for Bowman. But I wanted to see what everyone thinks. Is it worth sending them in, maybe with a short note acknowledging they are out of date but love their products (which I do) and thought it couldn't hurt? And if do that, I am guessing the address on the redemption cards is probably no longer accurate, but maybe I can find something online somewhere.



I appreciate any feedback/ideas/etc. If it definitely isn't worth it, I may just keep the redemption cards for my PC with the completed set. Thanks in advance and good luck in your collection building!

[Quick Mill Vetrano 2B Evo, Rancilio Rocky]","I’ve got a small leak on my steamer want at the nut. It’s very shiny steel and I don’t want to throw a wrench on it. Also, one of the ports filters seems either small, or something else is loose because liquid leaks around the outside of the portafilter now. I don’t even know if this is “user serviceable.” I got these two devices that came with my home so I’m not well versed in their maintenance but they do get used daily. 

After my old grinder quit grinding fine enough (Baratza encore), I dug up the Rancilo Rocky that came with the house as well. It was VERY dirty and appears to…. Be a bad design as is extremely messy, was caked with old grounds and even whole beans. Dumping my weighed beans in, they always get stuck and don’t fall down into the burrs without jiggling it, ground beans get left in the chute, in the machine, around the burrs, on the counter, everywhere. The spout is broken and I need a new one, and it also seems that the spout is too long, as I can’t seem to get all my ground coffee into the portafilter without knocking a bunch on the counter too. 

So I was going to order a new spout and saw it’s $50. Is there an alternative? Has anyone 3D printed one that is maybe a tad bit shorter to avoid spillage? I use 20-22g baskets, and the spout goes really far into the basket, making a mess. 

Is the Rocky a good grinder? I see some mixed reviews, but for now I’m going to clean it again, more thoroughly, and run with it for now but if there’s any tips and tricks to aid in ease of use / cleanliness I’d greatly appreciate it. ",1,1755277278.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

大家好
One of the last greatest double live jam session of this year in 中国. Today after storm passed. I went to my favorite Simtret cafe in 广州 China. My friend 火火 was waiting for me. We both wore suits without plans. We reconnected with coffee talked about life, perfumes, coffee future plans as good friends. After I began set equipment. 

All synth are mine except my gift to 火火. 
We played synths of woovebox box midi control korg NST1, Roland p6 and korg monodrone delay. I controlled nts and p6 while 火火chose monodrone. We decided to perform with both beat style of eastern hypnotic beats. Next western style. 

First time we both performed with beats as BGM as call and answers with synths. First time I managed two groove box with one synth. 

Surprised we both managed to perform twice life 45 min each session. We had good ☕️📷

Every practice session we improve. 火火 is able to express more. Also able to control two dials of LFO and reverb. She was super into it she forgot mosquito bit her hand during performance. She mentions that my skills for drone melody is superior than my lead melody. Encouraging me to play longer. Also end all songs. 

I will miss our jam sessions. Last time this with good friends, good coffee and good vibes. 

Anyone interested to collaborate for hobby project can contact me. DM with Reddit or discord

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

1mr3dr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1mr3dr1/assess_best_coffee_machines_ninja_cfp301_dualbrew/,Assess Best Coffee Machines Ninja CFP301 DualBrew Worth It or Not,"Testing out the Ninja CFP301 coffee machine has been an interesting journey as it has become part of my daily caffeine ritual. As a coffee lover, I couldn't wait to see how well this dual-purpose coffee maker handled different brewing needs. Its unique ability to cater to both coffee grounds and pods intrigued me, and I just had to put it through its paces. My expectations for a device boasting four brew styles and an independent hot water system were sky-high. Spoiler alert: while it met most expectations, a few quirks came with the territory.

**Dual Coffee Maker Design**  
The design of this device truly stands out with its ability to seamlessly switch between pods and grounds. I tested it with both K-Cups and my go-to coffee grounds, and it handled both options with ease. The range of sizes—small cup all the way up to a full carafe—was a delightful feature. As someone who alternates between solo cups in the morning and entertaining guests with a carafe over brunch, this adjustable capacity makes life so much simpler. The machine isn’t overly bulky, even with space for a 12-cup glass carafe, and it fit snuggly in my kitchen.

**Performance and Brew Styles**  
What impressed me the most was its range of four brew styles—Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty. I tried all four, and each one delivered something distinctive. The Rich brew added depth to my morning coffee, and the Over Ice option was surprisingly well-tailored for cold brews. Specialty mode became my personal favorite because it created a rich coffee concentrate perfect for lattes or cappuccinos. My mother, who has a penchant for experimenting with macchiatos, gave it her seal of approval. However, I did find that the Over Ice brew, while tasty, could occasionally leave a bit more condensation on the plate than expected. A minor gripe, but worth mentioning.

**Independent Hot Water System: A Convenient Touch**  
Not only does this machine whip up a stellar cup of joe, but it also features a separate hot water system with two temperature settings—hot and boil. This came in handy for making tea, instant oatmeal, and even soup. The design ensured that my coffee remained unaffected by the hot water function, preventing any odd flavor mixing—kudos for that! My niece, during her weekend stay, even used it for hot chocolate, and let's just say the smile on her face said it all.

**Good Aspects**  
- Brew times are fast, even when prepping a full carafe.  
- Versatility with coffee types and sizes, suitable for every occasion.  
- Specialty brew mode for enthusiasts of café-style drinks.  
- Independent hot water system makes multitasking a breeze.  

**Pitfalls**  
- The coffee machine is quite loud during operation, especially with pods.  
- While it’s relatively compact, some might find it a tight fit under shorter cabinets.  
- Cleaning the reusable filter and frother can be tedious at times.  

**Product Competitors**  
In comparison to some of its direct competitors, the Ninja CFP301 shines in specific areas but has room for improvement in others. Take the Keurig K-Elite, for example. It definitely matches the Ninja's speed with pod brewing, but it lacks the brew style versatility that the Ninja offers. Conversely, the Keurig feels slightly quieter during operation. Then there’s the Breville Bambino Plus, known for its superior frothing capabilities. While the Ninja does feature a frother, it's clear that Breville is in a league of its own for those who prioritize steamed milk perfection. The Ninja’s specialty brew still gives it an edge though, as it provides versatility unmatched by these competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering its ability to brew everything from simple pods to robust specialty drinks, this machine offers a solid feature-to-value ratio. While not the cheapest unit out there, the multifunctionality justifies the investment. It's essentially an all-in-one product targeting coffee enthusiasts who enjoy experimenting with styles while keeping convenience at the core. The functionality of having a separate hot water system adds to its value, especially if you’re into beverages outside of coffee.

The apartment is only a 5-10 minute drive from the IM fields/East Campus Village. It’s also right next to a Kroger and Publix and a bunch of fast food places like Chick-fil-a, Taco Bell, Papa Johns, Barbaritos, Jittery Joes, etc. An Athens Transit line does run to the apartment. UGA Vet Med also comes across the street so you can also use the Vet Med bus. The apartment complex also has a pool, basketball court, tennis court, volleyball court, and office area where you can study. Parking for guests is free and visitation is welcomed.

It’s a room in a four bedroom apartment with a private bathroom. It comes furnished with a bed, desk, dresser, and nightstand. It has a good sized closet, as well, with standing mirror doors. The living room comes furnished with sofas, a coffee table, a TV, and there are basic kitchen appliances and a washer/dryer.

The rent is $739 a month and utilities (water, sewage, and electricity) **is** charged separately. Parking, wi-fi, and trash is **not** charged separately and included in the rent payment.

All of the other 3 roommates are other females. Everyone is very kind and keep to themselves mostly. They're neat and maintenance is very quick to help!

I (19F) met him (41M) at a coffee shop near my office. He was just sitting there reading, looking way too put together for a random Tuesday afternoon. I made a dumb comment about his book, he smiled, and somehow we ended up talking for over an hour.

He’s confident without being cocky, funny in that dry “been there, done that” way, and actually listens when I talk. He remembered tiny details I mentioned days earlier, which caught me totally off guard.

We’ve had a few coffee “accidental meetups” since, and I can’t tell if he’s just being friendly or if there’s something more. Every time he smiles at me, I get that stupid fluttery feeling in my stomach.

I know the age gap will make some people raise their eyebrows, but honestly? It just feels… easy. Like I’ve known him forever.

Should I just go for it and ask him to dinner, or keep it casual and see if he makes the first move?

1mr37r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1mr37r7/i_think_my_bf_had_some_sort_of_episode_last_night/,I think my bf had some sort of episode last night,"UpDATE - he just apologized but then said that it was all because he said he smelled evil coming off of me. 
First of all bf does not do drugs. Didn’t have any alcohol. Is what I’m describing a manic episode? He’s been sick to his stomach with some sort of bug. I went away with my friend which is abnormal for me, all I ever do is work or stay home. Friend was going to a conference so she said come on a free 3 day getaway. With travel back to east coast it made it 4 days. I called him to say hi on Monday & he was throwing up. He sounded awful. Called again while she was at a dinner & we FaceTimed. He looked terrible. FaceTimed again next day to show him how cool place was & he said he was happy for me. He has gone home to see family, work trips & a trip with dad. I’m always the one home. He picked me up at airport, still battling nausea & tired, I was tired too so we went to sleep. Next day he slept to 1:30. PM. I left for a few hours. 

Came home & he was studying, said he wanted to keep studying, (he’s trying to change careers). I asked if he wanted dinner…no. I left him alone & watched tv. Went to bed late. I was just coming out of bathroom & he asked “can I have a b…..b” 😳 I found it insulting, like I’m a hooker. I was also annoyed because this person who was so sick they somehow managed to get vomit on the walls & baseboard in bathroom, even the wall far from toilet & claims not to have seen it. Was feeling ready to be serviced. This caused me to get angry. I was like who says that? No romance. It’s not the first time he has out of nowhere come to me & said “help me out I need…” 

Heated argument begins. Now I’ll be first to admit that our sex life isn’t as great as it once was. But I’m sick & tired of cleaning up after him like a child. Every day I wake up first, scrub the kitchen down, clean the apartment, make coffee, breakfast & then wake him up. We eat together & cuddle on the couch if there’s time then he leaves for work. I try to stay out of his way because he doesn’t like me to be in same room when he’s walking around. He says it’s a spacial awareness issue. I have honestly thought he may be on the spectrum. A few days before I left we went to mall & he was walking in what I can only describe as wide geometric patterns. He said it was to avoid crowds… there were maybe 2-4 people somewhat near us as it was 11 AM on a Thursday. 

Anyway. Back to argument- he is angry I have been dealing with some hormone issues & had my period 3x in past 2 months. One of the reasons he’s not getting any. Then he accuses me of “taking care of myself” behind his back & makes me look him in the eyes to assure him I haven’t. I finally tell him it’s hard to want to have sex with someone you sometimes see as a child given that I wake up & clean the mess he makes at night, then I have to clean up the mess he makes when he spills stuff in the morning… counters, stove top, microwave, anything he makes like smoothies- leaves it all over the place. Doesn’t rinse anything. Towels all over floor, if he shaves it’s all over sink, counter, floor & somehow even toilet. Then after cleaning I either go to work or get to relax at home while writing. Then he comes home & it’s clean the mess all over again. 

So he then tells me it’s over. Then tells me I broke his heart. I tell him I’m upset too but I think if we can’t work it out maybe it’s best I move out. That I would wait until he can find a roommate. He then tells me he wanted me to be mother of his kids because there’s so many things he loves about me. But that it’s not in him to clean. Maybe that’s why his dad lives alone, his grandma lives alone so he should too. So I explained that the constant cleaning has killed my sex drive. That I find it disgusting that he just leaves everything everywhere. Pees on the floor & toilet everyday, the vomit is a one time thing but come on, towels all over bathroom floor & even shower. Epsom salt all over floor, it is even in the bed as he tracked it on his feet. So he tells me it’s over. That he paid for the bed so I need to go sleep on the couch even though he paid for it. Then he mentions the bedding is mine so this complicates things. Then he tries to hold me. Then of course he starts trying to press himself inside me. I tell him no. He stops. We talk a little, he rubs my back. I’m starting to feel better. Then he tells me I need to get out of the bed. I’m taking the covers off him. I turn on the light…. He’s got all the covers. I mention this & he tells me I’m bothering him. I take enough covers that I’m covered. He then decided I’m causing his legs to move. Then I fall asleep & he yells at me that I started to snore. I’ve had pneumonia for past 2 months & just got better a week ago & apologize but point out that my sinuses aren’t 100% but he snores loud every night. Always has. I fall back to sleep & ha wakes me up again telling me that he’s bothered, doesn’t know why, but that it has to be me. It’s now 5:30 AM. I cough & he gets pissed. I prop myself up and pretend to be asleep. He wakes me up telling me I’m snoring. I’m not. I tell him I wasn’t so he says “well something is bothering me & I don’t know what. “ I tell him I will pack up & figure out a move when I get up. He gets upset by this. - what the hell is going on?

I just stumbled across something actually WILD—turns out, you don't have to be a coder or some Silicon Valley genius to get **paid** for testing apps. 

Yes. You read that correctly.  
Absolute NO EXPERIENCE needed.  
I'm not kidding; my brain just glitched from shock.  

For real. You can literally start testing apps, giving feedback like, “Yo, your button is weird,” or “I found a bug,"" and there are companies HAPPY to throw money at you for it.

I thought this was some prank until I fell down a rabbit hole and KEEP reading about people just… signing up, tapping around, and *boom*, a little cash hits their account.  

**Could that be me? Could that be YOU?**

So here’s what I pieced together:

- You need simple English (not Shakespeare).
- You need a phone, tablet, or PC. *No supercomputer required.*
- You need the ability to click stuff. (Tell me this isn’t doable??)
- And you need to click this: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

I fully expected an application form longer than a CVS receipt or, idk, a sneaky scam situation, BUT no—sign up and you’re in. Mind = blown.   
  
If you still don’t believe me, I literally double-triple-quadruple checked:  
**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
Those who got in say the reviews are as easy as writing “Didn’t load,” or “Loved the colors!” and then you move on to the next app. WHAAAT?

Let me recap, because my coffee isn’t hitting nearly as hard as this:

- Pick an app.
- Play around, test stuff, be nosy.
- Report what you think.
- Get paid.  
- More apps = more feedback = MORE cash.  

I’m honestly SHOCKED we aren’t all doing this.  
Why isn’t every college student or stay-at-home-anyone already signed up??? 🤯

And—one more thing—NO resume action, no Zoom interviews, nada.  
It’s just: email, password, go.  

Here’s what I'm actually losing sleep over:  
How high can you scale this??  
How did I live in total ignorance of this entire *economy* until now?!  
Could I have Netflix money every time I tell some developer “The notification annoyed me”?  

If you’ve ever dreamed about getting into tech without burning through textbooks or tutorials, this could genuinely be it.  
The world is shifting and people are getting *paid* to test today’s hottest new apps, without a single diploma.  
I MEAN…Why are you still reading this when you could tap this link:  
**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
Still stunned. Still hyped.  
GO TRY IT. Report back if you score some app cash!!!  

TL;DR:  
Beta testing is the new secret side hustle, and the link **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** might literally change your week—or your wallet.

1mr35yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mr35yb/small_business_membership_program/,Small Business Membership Program,"TL;DR what’s the best software to use for an indie book store to do tiered memberships and loyalty programs?

Lemme preface by saying I’m not a business owner, just the manager of an independent used book store. I don’t have a business degree but I’m trying to understand all this more. 

We (myself and business owner) want to revamp our membership system to include tiers for customers who may want different benefits.

Right now, we do a flat $25/year subscription thru Shopify. That includes a physical punch card (outdated, I know) that they use to earn rewards plus a 15% - 25% discount on our new book selection. 

What we’re thinking is three monthly support tiers:
- $5/month — basically just a tip jar and get the occasional member only sale, plus loyalty rewards. 
- $10/month — 10% discount on all of our used books (95% of our inventory)
- $15/month — everything else plus a 30% discount on our new books

We also want a loyalty program for frequent spenders, and a way to send personalized coupons and messages to regular customers. I’m not sure if that would require integration to our POS at all, but if it helps we mostly use Square and GoDaddy. 

Where I’m getting caught up is that the only platforms I’ve been able to find that do this kind of stuff is Patreon, Buy me a coffee, or ko-fi. Those all appear to be more geared towards single creators or single person businesses. Not wanting to toot our horn here, but we are a bit bigger; we opened two other locations this year and each store has around 10ish employees. We are doing pretty well business wise from what I can see and get a lot of foot traffic in and out of the stores. 

A big portion of our customer base is also either older or not as technologically literate (we serve a lot of homeschooling families and elderly), and I can foresee asking them to create a Patreon account to support us leading to headache for all parties involved. 

I’m looking for something that can do the tiered memberships and maybe even one time donations, have a loyalty program (preferably with digital punch cards which I think would require integration with our POS?) and something that is very customer friendly and is just as easy for the 90 year old reader who’s rarely on the internet to use as it is for anyone else. 

I’ve been seeing a bit of stuff about TapMango, does anyone have any experience with them?

If this doesn’t exist or I’m asking too much, tell me! Like I said I’m kinda outta my depth here but I want to learn and help the business grow so any and all help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!!!",1,1755276140.0,smallbusiness,3,1.0,False

**If you could rebuild any part of the network, what would it be? And how would you do it?**

My fantasy project would put the A line in a cut-and-cover tunnel under highland park and convert the station into an open-air trench. The Gold Line part of the A line is generally pretty fast but the crawl through Highland Park feels unbearable. This would speed up the whole section and reduce conflicts with traffic.

I'd build it by constructing a shoo-fly track on the exiting roadway to keep service running, then tunnel out one side of the road at a time and bury the track. In this fantasy scenario, the people owning property next to the current track are on board with the plan because it will ultimately reduce train noise. Once the line is buried, I'd place a linear park along where the current tracks are and upgrade the plaza with spots for food trucks and a hipster coffee/bike repair shop.",8,1755276112.0,LAMetro,14,0.84,False

I wanted to bring you an update about a case I've been following for some time now and covered over two years ago. I actually wrote the first update post about two months ago, but it was deleted because the website that posted the update clashed with this sub's rules regarding source quality. Unfortunately, that was the only available article at the time; Now, however, more info about the case has been released, so I hope this time this update will be allowed.

  
The recap part of my original post read:

  
""You can read my post about the case [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/13o3tte/teen_girls_remains_are_found_in_a_secluded_spot/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but to recap:

On the 18th of June 2021, the remains of a teen girl (around 14 to 17 years old) were found in a field off County Road 225, east of County Road 226 in Wharton County, Texas, USA. She has been ""left to rot"" in the sun, with no attempts made to bury her body; She was pretty much a skeleton by the time she was found. She had been in the field for about few months, and her cause of death was homicide by multiple gunshot wounds.

Her ethnicity/race was unknown, and she was about 4' 8""-5' 2"" (56-62 inches/142-158 cm). Other than that, the only thing that could've been said for certain was that she had black/dark brown hair that reached her shoulders and upper back.

She was found wearing a t-shirt with Stitch from the movie ""Lilo and Stitch"" with the word ""OHANA"" printed on it, a Love Tree brand jacket (with no further description), and shorts with images of donuts and coffee mugs. Jane was either barefoot or her shoes were taken/lost before she was found. She also had three rings on her fingers: one with two hearts, another with a large clear/white stone, and another that had multiple clear/white stones.

A reconstruction by National Center for Missing and Exploited children (NCMEC) was made for her in November of 2024.""

  
Jane Doe was identified as Yeimy Maciela Beltrand from Houston, Texas. She was just 16 when she went missing. Her mother reported her disappearance on the 30th of April, 15 days after Yeimy was last seen. Yeimy was identified through her mother's DNA, which was uploaded to the Combined DNA Index System, and the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, who was able to make the match.

  
Yesterday, more info about Yeimy's murder and its perpetrator have been released. When Yeimy was reported missing by her mother, she did it after she recieved a call about her daughter allegedly being murdered. In April of 2021, a woman, who was Yeimy's friend, was interviewed about witnessing the crime. She, Yeimy, and Yeimy's boyfriend, 27-year old Luis Omar Beltran-Mendoza, were travelling down I-45, when Mendoza hit Yeimy in the face. Yeimy then threatened to report him to the police for unspecified crimes; Mendoza then shot Yeimy in the face three times. Mendoza threatened Yeimy's friend and dropped her off at a house where she was held against her will for a few days and eventually released. The woman picked Mendoza in a photo lineup during her police interview. 

  
On the 7th of August, a murder charge has been filed under Mendoza's name, but he hasn't been arrested- some sources describe him as ""on the run"".

  
My condolences for Yeimy's loved ones. I hope that justice will be brought soon.

Putting it together was a bit tricky in some spots, especially around the vaults, but nothing crazy. Took me a couple of hours, music blasting, coffee in hand, and now I just keep going back to stare at it.

**I’m aware this post is long as fuck. If you’re not down for an in-depth report, here’s the executive summary in bullet point format:**

* Matcha has become so popular that we’re in the midst of a matcha shortage.
* Matcha is a difficult scent to capture in perfumery.
* I review nine indie matcha scents.
* **I enjoyed**: Astrid - Matcha Petit Four, Osmofolia - Matcha, Source - Match Made In Heaven, Nocturne Alchemy - Matcha Latte, and Nocturne Alchemy Vanilla Crème Matcha.
* **It was fine**: d.grayi - Matcha Cat, Morari - Matcha Latte.
* **I did not enjoy**: Haus of Gloi - White Chocolate & Matcha, Pulp - Matcha Massacre.
* **For an in-depth review of any of these scents, please scroll to the relevant bolded portion of the text.**

It’s [Sardine Girl Summer](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sardine-girl-summer-trend-outfits). No, wait, it’s [Guava Girl Summer](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/guava-girl-summer-trend-nails-makeup-and-outfits)! [Tomato Girl Summer](https://www.bbwinc.com/media/stories/a-tomato-girl-summer-at-bath-body-works)? ([or was that 2024, or even 2023](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/tomato-girl-summer-jonathan-anderson-and-a-viral-heirloom)? The internet cannot decide.) Since we’re debating TikTok trends to distract ourselves from heatwaves and dystopia ([Crash Out Girl Summer](https://www.glamour.com/story/its-the-summer-of-the-crash-out)?), I propose that 2025 is, in fact, Matcha Girl Summer. A couple of months ago, I walked into a coffee shop called Java House to find that the specials on the chalkboard menu had no java in them at all - they were exclusively fancy matcha drinks. Pistachio matcha latte! White chocolate matcha latte! Berries & cream matcha latte! Not that matcha and matcha lattes are new to 2025 - Starbucks introduced their “Green Tea Latte” in 2006, and [Google searches for the word “matcha” in the US took off about ten or so years ago](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=matcha) \- but this felt like another level of intensity.

A little research revealed that I was not mistaken about this intensity. On June 18, Etsy advertised to me in an email with the subject line “Because matcha’s having a moment.” On June 20, *Vogue* published an article called “[The Maturing of Matcha: The New (Old) Wave of Matcha Sweeping the Country](https://www.vogue.com/article/matcha-new-wave).” On June 25, *Betches* Media asked, “[When Did Matcha Become the Hot Girls’ Drink of Choice](https://betches.com/matcha-trend-benefits/)?” The trend isn’t limited to the United States; back in August of last year, *TimeOut London* explained “[How London turned green: the relentless rise of matcha](https://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/relentless-rise-of-matcha).” On June 10, *The* *Korea Times* announced, [“Matcha craze sweeps Korea’s cafes, supermarkets.”](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/lifestyle/trends/20250610/matcha-craze-sweeps-koreas-cafes-supermarkets) And on June 24, a *Vogue India* author disconcertingly proclaimed, “[Of course I like matcha, I used to eat chalk](https://www.vogue.in/content/of-course-i-like-matcha-i-used-to-eat-chalk).” (Turns out the author had a pica phase in childhood, and matcha’s slightly gritty quality hits the same spot for her. You do you, girl.)

In fact, matcha has reached a level of popularity such that the backlash may have already begun. If you have a tenuous grasp on your masculinity, [you may be concerned that drinking matcha isn’t macho](https://www.gq.com/story/men-drinking-matcha-debate). On a more serious note, the *Independent* proclaimed, “[the hype around matcha is making a mockery of this deeply traditional drink](https://www.the-independent.com/life-style/food-and-drink/features/matcha-tea-latte-trend-health-benefits-b2772204.html),” pointing out that the worldwide craze has lessened the culturally specific Japanese connection to the drink, and that many of the mass-produced, sugary foods and beverages use cheaper *green tea* powder as opposed to *matcha* powder. 

More concerningly, matcha’s soaring popularity has already led to a [shortage](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq7w1n00xeo). Because of how the tea plants are grown and processed, production can’t just simply be scaled up. The shortage has caused matcha lovers [to spar with and snipe at each other online](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/matcha-lovers-are-turning-against-each-other-over-global-shortage/ar-AA1IfKss), with accusations of hoarding, wastefulness, unappreciation, and gatekeeping. (A comment on a TikTok post showing off a large matcha collection reads, “You’re now on my hit list.” Another on a different collection post reprimands, “This is the greed they talk about in the Bible.”) Don’t feel too bad about that ersatz green tea powder that Starbucks is (probably) putting in your drink - MatchaTok will thank you. 

It’s also green tea powder that’s likely going into your matcha scone, tiramisu, cheesecake, ice cream, etc. And that’s because the matcha craze hasn’t just confined itself to the beverage world: it’s extended to desserts, [cocktails](https://mizubatea.com/blogs/recipes/cocktail-recipe-roundup-7-matcha-cocktails-you-have-to-try?srsltid=AfmBOooli2I61YkL-GpYRZbojHFQ-nKbaV7ber2a7d7OsUuFpKxCeiLe), [skincare](https://www.whowhatwear.com/beauty/skin/matcha-skincare-trend), and of course - the reason you’re reading this - perfume. Along with [plum, fig, marshmallow](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-perfume-trends-according-to-experts), and pistachio (sorry, Kayali - [indie perfumers called pistachio well before you did](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/195xv4w/a_posh_stash_of_pistachios/)), matcha seems poised to take over the rest of 2025 in the fragrance world. Unless bakers, perfumers, and the cosmetics industry resort to generic green tea, they won’t be able to match the matcha mania. 

So, given that most of what we’re consuming is probably 1) not actually matcha, and 2) diluted by various quantities of milk, sugar, perfumer’s alcohol, or hyaluronic acid serums, what makes a good matcha scent? The answer will vary by preference, of course, but at least vis-a-vis accuracy, you’ll need an accord that smells like seaweed. Dimethyl sulfide, [also produced by some marine algae](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0963996925002820) (and apparently a strain of E. coli?), is a key compound that makes matcha smell like matcha, and[ that contributes to the seaweed-like aroma](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0963996925002820) ([other scientists say the aroma is caused by a combination of aldehydes and ketones, but the combo is reminiscent of seaweed nonetheless](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590157524001214#s0070)). Unfortunately, the odor has been described as “disagreeable” (yet another reason why matcha is diluted with lots of milk and sugar). 

So, if a perfumer doesn’t want to make a disagreeable scent, which other aspects of matcha should they imitate? The volatile aroma compounds [vary according to whether the matcha is low, medium, or high-grade](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b00421?casa_token=yr64hH_XqC8AAAAA%3AOeM3x5iqNjFQ2DjTy_ZDzvuPw9AU53Ts5SukcVXjhRtJH3oIkSIznX_7ShpVNagtlWemSUtbpX86), but, generally speaking, other adjectives to describe matcha are “grassy,” “earthy,” “umami,” “clean,” “green,” and “fresh.” For my own part, I’ve come to realize that whether a perfume smells like IRL matcha is independent of whether I enjoy wearing it. **My rating scale is therefore twofold: 1) Is it a match(a), i.e., does the scent actually smell like matcha? 2) In our current matcha shortage, would I fight a TikTok influencer for it, i.e., do I like it?**

To date, I have tried 21 perfumes, both indie and niche, with a listed matcha note, and I’ve chosen to review nine of them here; I culled my list by limiting myself to indies and scents that actually have “matcha” in the name. 

**Astrid - Matcha Petit Four** (*Matcha-infused vanilla cake with lightly glazed matcha frosting*): When I first tested this, I thought it was pretty but uninteresting in that it was simply what it says on the bottle: green matcha and vanilla. I decided not to destash my sample, though, and thought it would be appropriate to take on my trip to Japan last winter. Wearing it several times on vacation, I began to love it. It was a lesson to me in how my impression of a perfume can evolve if I just spend more time with it: I realized the matcha was bitter, but not overly so, and the vanilla really did have a fluffy, cake-like dimension. It also lasted through a day of sightseeing, which is longer than most other matcha scents that I've tried so far in this list. 

Is it a match(a)? Probably medium-grade, but yes.

Would I fight a TikToker for it? Yes. I would absolutely leave catty remarks on their latest haul post.

**d.grayi - Matcha Cat** (*TOP: Catnip, Bergamot, Tea Leaves ✦ HEART: Matcha Tincture, Muguet ✦ BASE: Hinoki, Sandalwood, Civettone*): I’ve tried two d.grayi scents, Matcha Cat and Low Carb Cat. Low Carb Cat worked beautifully for me, while Matcha Cat…well, I can tell it’s well-blended, but almost too well-blended. At the very beginning, I smelled a fresh, leafy greenness, but it quickly disappeared. After a few minutes, it settled into a vague, perfumey sweetness. If I used my imagination, I could smell the bergamot and tea, but I had to concentrate. 

Is it a match(a)? For a fleeting moment.

Would I fight a TikToker for it? It’s clickbait - has a flashy title, but the rest of the content is mid. 

**Haus of Gloi - White Chocolate & Matcha** (*Earthy green tea powder swirled into creamy white chocolate*): Haus of Gloi doesn’t tend to work well for me in that a lot of their scents tend to pull plasticky on me, and white chocolate - from *any* house - usually pulls plasticky on me. So, surprising no one, this was matcha and plastic. If I tried to mentally tune out the plastickiness, it was very much like a creamy, milky, matcha latte. The matcha smell was grassy and earthy, and there was more emphasis here than on the white chocolate. Unfortunately, I could only ignore the plastic for so long.

Is it a match(a)? Matcha cut with plastic, but yes.

Would I fight a TikToker for it? Not worth gatekeeping.

**Morari - Matcha Latte** (*Matcha, Steamed Almond Milk*): I get a vanillic milk scent, which is pleasant, and it does lean a bit almondy (this is a good thing - I like almond). The matcha is discernible as a light greenness, but it's definitely not matcha-forward by any means. The vanilla and green fade pretty quickly, too, and I'm left with a mostly unsweet, milky almond. While it was pleasant enough, I already destashed it.

Is it a match(a)? It tried to hang with the MatchaTok crowd, [but was accused of being performative](https://nypost.com/2025/08/05/lifestyle/men-mocked-by-women-for-obnoxious-performative-drinking-habit-you-guys-ruined-matcha/).

Would I fight a TikToker for it? No. It needs to learn to stand up to bullies on its own.

**Nocturne Alchemy - Matcha Latte** (*Japanese Matcha (Green Tea Powder) Accord, Japanese Green Tea Notes, Whipped Rice Milk Accord, Bastet’s Musk, Sweet Musk, and White Sandalwood*): Green, lemony citrus, vanilla. I asked my husband what he smelled without telling him the name, and he said, “Green? Aloe? Is it a cucumber perfume?” It smells more like an iced matcha latte than a hot one in that it feels like a light, cool scent instead of a more intense, warm one. I feel like I get more green the further away my nose is; up close, it becomes more lemony. I like it, and it does actually remind me of a matcha latte, even if it doesn't have the bitterness of real matcha that I'd like to see. To quote a MatchaTok comment: “Oh she’s vibrant 💚”

Is it a match(a)? Just because it’s green doesn’t mean it’s matcha.

Would I fight a TikToker for it?: Yes, but not with an enormous amount of effort. Just some light snark.

**Nocturne Alchemy - Vanilla Crème Matcha** (**Japanese Matcha (Green Tea Powder) Accord, Japanese Green Tea Notes, Bastet’s Ice Cream (Vanilla Crystalline Cream, Butter accord, Caramel Accord, French Vanilla Bean Absolute, Vanilla Milk accord, Vanilla Orchid, Crystalline Absolute and Vanilla Sugar), Bastet’s Musk, Whipped Crème Accord and Vanilla Bean**): Despite having several overlapping notes with Matcha Latte, Vanille Crème Matcha is substantially sweeter and creamier (expected) and earthier (unexpected!). Since the listed matcha and green tea accords look the same, I think the BIC and vanilla might be doing a lot of work here to contrast with and highlight the more umami facets of the tea. Or I could be hallucinating what I want to smell - who knows? Regardless, despite the name, I think Vanilla Crème Matcha is more like a matcha latte than Matcha Latte and I like it better.

Is it a match(a)? Surprisingly, yes.

TikTok comment: I might try to wheedle my way into an influencer’s good graces. To quote another haul post comment: “Follow me let’s be matcha friends 😁😁😁😁”

**Osmofolia - Matcha** (*Nutty, seaweedy, grassy, powdery, and green. A non-milky, non-sugared matcha single note. TOP/WET: grass ✦  hay MID/HEART: matcha powder ✦ seaweed  BASE/DRYDOWN: usucha ✦  baby vegetables ✦ roasted nuts*): Grassy, nutty, seaweed, tea, perfect. And it. Is. So. Fleeting. As in, seriously, it goes top > heart > base in ten-fifteen minutes, which is devastating, because I would really wear this, seaweed note be damned. I would never destash this because of the insane artistry, but damn if the performance isn’t wretched. 

Is it a match(a)? The Venn diagram of matcha and this perfume is a circle.

Would I fight a TikToker for it? Real life fisticuffs.

**Pulp - Matcha Massacre** (*Earthy matcha, horrifying hinoki, palo santo sticks, orris, perilous patchouli & sweet fluffy marshmallows*): I have a high hit rate with Pulp, but when I first tested this, I was so confused that I thought I might have been sent a mislabeled vial. I couldn’t smell *any* of the notes - no matcha, no palo santo, no orris, not even patchouli or marshmallow, both of which tend to be strong notes in Pulp fragrances. It smelled lemony, maybe a little woody, and maybe I got a shred of a tea leaf? I left it on for an hour before scrubbing, hoping the drydown would change it, but no dice.

Is it a match(a)? This is not matcha. This is barely even tea. This is hot water with lemon that has been infused with a couple of twigs.

Would I fight a TikToker for it? I’m sure there’s a wellness influencer who could start a lemony twig water craze - maybe they would want it.

**Sorce - Match Made in Heaven** (*Matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood*): The first Sorce where I was able to compare the oil and EDP versions, and the difference is pretty startling. It's recognizably the same fragrance, but I can smell the details and individual notes much better in the EDP. The matcha actually comes out as a top note (I couldn’t really smell any at all in the oil), a bit of the cherry blossom, a bit of the almond, and the sandalwood does too, eventually, as a base note. While the waffle cone and vanilla are by far the most prominent in both versions, it's just much more interesting in its alcohol format. Objective description aside, god this is gorgeous. It is also *powerful*. I wore it on a day our department had an end-of-semester party, and a colleague walked into the hallway and announced, “I can’t wait for that cake…I can smell it all the way in the hall!” I hadn’t picked up the cake yet. It was just me. 

Is it a match(a)? Probably generic green tea powder, but I don’t care.

Would I fight a TikToker for it? To quote a MatchaTok comment: “PLEASE SHARE I WILL GIVE U ONE OF MY KIDNEY\[sic\]”

Now that I’m at the end of this small novella, tell me: What are your favorite matcha perfumes? Which ones are the best matches to matcha? I’d love to try more!

About me
	•	28, single, EU citizen
	•	Languages: Italian, English, Portuguese

	•	Have a small dog — access to good vets (ideally 24/7) is important

Cities I’m considering
	•	Riga (LV)
	•	Vilnius (LT)
	•	Tallinn (EE)

What I’m trying to figure out (please compare across all three):

	1.	Where to live (neighborhoods)
	•	Riga: Centrs, Vecrīga (Old Town), Āgenskalns, other dog-friendly, walkable areas?

	•	Typical rent for a modern, pet-friendly studio/1-bed in each city’s central-ish areas.

	2.	Housing & traps
	•	Common traps to watch out for when renting in each city (contract clauses, hidden fees, sketchy sublets, utility indexing, unregistered leases)?
	•	Typical lease lengths, deposit norms, agent fees, and whether pet deposits are a thing.
	•	Buildings: How’s sound insulation & winter heating in pre-war/Jugendstil vs Soviet-era vs new builds? Any building types/streets to avoid?

	3.	Dog life
	•	Reliable 24/7 veterinary clinics and recommended regular vets in each city.
	•	Dog-friendly cafés/bars, parks, off-leash areas, and rules for dogs on public transport.
	•	Any pet registration/insurance must-dos on arrival?

	4.	Nightlife & meeting people
	•	Which city is better for a late-20s newcomer to make a few friends quickly (expat/local meetups, language exchanges, hobby groups)?
	•	Bars/clubs/venues that feel more local than touristy—any door policies/dress codes to know?

	5.	Quality of life
	•	Day-to-day vibe: cleanliness, green space, winter maintenance, walkability.
	•	Safety at night—areas to avoid in each city? Common scams/nightlife pitfalls.
	•	Winter survival tips (gear, daylight/SAD hacks, indoor activities).

	6.	Work
	•	Home internet reliability/speeds and ISPs you recommend/avoid in each city.
	•	Best coworking spaces (quiet booths, call rooms, good coffee, community).


	7.	Utilities & bills
	•	Average monthly heating, electricity, water, trash, internet for a 1-bed near the center—winter vs summer—in each city.

	8.	Banking & payments
	•	Is a local bank account useful, or are Revolut/Wise generally fine?
	•	Card/cash quirks (contactless limits, cash-only spots, how rent/utilities are usually paid).

	9.	Mobile & home internet
	•	Best mobile carriers for coverage (and eSIM) in each country.
	•	Any truly unlimited home internet plans to recommend/avoid?

	10.	Transport & connectivity

	12.	Language
	•	How far does English get me day-to-day in each place?
	•	For basics: better to learn Latvian/Lithuanian/Estonian respectively, or is Russian more practical in certain contexts?

	13.	Bonus — Weekend escapes
	•	Favorite day/weekend trips (sea towns, forests, national parks, nearby countries) and best seasons—per city.

My tentative plan

Nobody clock-watched, start times were flexible and as long as deadlines were met, you could take a long lunch or wear jeans on a Friday without anyone batting an eye. People actually liked coming in. we’d chat in the hallway, grab coffee together and it felt like a place where you could breathe.

Then last month, we got a new boss. Overnight it became “be at your desk by 8:55 sharp,” “lunch break max 30 minutes,” and “business casual, every day.” No exceptions. The first week, everyone just laughed it off. But now? People barely talk. No more spontaneous hallway jokes, no more mid-afternoon coffee runs. Everyone’s tense, heads down, watching the clock. I didn’t realize how much those little freedoms mattered until they disappeared. I’m still doing my job fine but I can feel myself slowly disconnecting. The work itself hasn’t changed but the environment feels heavier. It’s not just rules... it’s the way they make you feel like a cog instead of a human.

I’m not a daily drinker but a binge drinker. I can’t remember the last time I drank without blacking/passing out.

My issue is  I can’t sit still and I always feel like I have something to do. I work from home and find myself pacing/cleaning all day. I’m so scatterbrained too. Racing thoughts and lists of things I need to do. Even when I’ve been sober for months at a time this is a thing. I used to have a drink at 2pm and felt I could relax and sit down. I’ve kicked that habit (my drinking is now only in vacations or “events” bdays, etc). I am so tired of never being able to relax at my home now. The only time I sit still is with a screen or constant stimulation.

I have convinced myself to look forward to mornings which I really do - coffee, morning walk, get some work in, but by the time noon hits the day is just so exhausting. 

I have young kids and when I had 1-2 drinks I felt like I could focus on them and wanted to do things. That sounds so bad, but as my husband describes it that he can tell when I’ve had a drink because I can actually sit down and watch a tv show or movie.  Sober I can’t just sit down and relax. Has anyone had anything similar or any advice…?

Okay, firstly... I'll absolutely admit that this may sound a bit odd at first, but hey, hear me out! 

Essentially, there's a lot weighing on me lately. I'm dealing with chronic and worsening health stuff, I'm feeling disconnected from the city and local social communities (health stuff makes it hard to go out), and with a project I'm working on at the moment? It is definitely an overwhelming, and intimidating task, and honestly even if it is a passion project, I wonder if I bit off more than I could chew.

With all of this (and more) weighing on me... I'm sort of feeling this overwhelming urge to just be held, and squeezed. I mean, it is one of those things that has been known to bring comfort to many people who are on the autistic spectrum after all, including myself. And no, this isn't a ""hug"" like some people thought I meant on my last posts. To be honest, it doesn't even have to involve physical contact. I mean, just having me wrapped up in a blanket burrito, and being squeezed from the outside of the burrito would be much closer to what I'm hoping for out of this. 

Of course I'd absolutely love to cook you some food! We could watch a show, listen to music, talk (or not), and of course we could do the squeeze whenever you felt comfortable! The squeeze would ideally last for a few minutes, but that can be discussed. I just think it should be long enough that i can actually allow myself to relax into it. Ideally, we should talk online, and meet for a coffee first since something like this requires at least a bit of established trust. 

Honestly, I don't even know if posting this will yield anything. I'm nervous about even being this vulnerable with expressing a need like this. But hey, I've met some fabulous people on reddit before... so honestly? Why not?

If you are open to this concept, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk, and see what we can do from there! If you'd benefit from a good squeeze too, I can do the same for you!

A bit about me! I'm 26, non binary, living in Coquitlam (but can travel anywhere!). I'm neurodivergent (obviously), and have interests that range from music, art, and creativity, to transit, and horror! I love going out into nature sometimes, but I also enjoy staying in, and gaming too. I'm also trying to get into alternative fashion more!

For something like this, I probably would prefer to connect with other LGBTQ+ folks, and neurodivergent folks too. I do tend to be picky about the cis men I connect with, but I'm not opposed. Just please approach me with a message that actually shows you read this post, and DO NOT bring up, or even imply anything that is NSFW, otherwise I will block you! This act is meant to be platonic in nature. 

Anyways! I look forward to hearing from some people!

Also, to help show me you've read this post, please tell me your favourite types of music! ",2,1755275024.0,r4r,1,0.75,False

I run a digital business and have a dog. Looking for neighborhood recs (Centrs vs Old Town?), 24/7 vets, dog-friendly spots, nightlife/friends scene, things to do, and general quality-of-life tips.

About me
	•	28, single, EU citizen
	•	Languages: Italian, English, Portuguese
	•	Run my own fully digital business (expanding)
	•	Have a small dog — access to good vets (ideally 24/7) is important

What I’m trying to figure out

	1.	Where to live
	•	Pros/cons of Centrs vs Old Town (Vecrīga) for a newcomer?
	•	Other neighborhoods I should consider for walkability + dog-friendly living, e.g., any areas across the river or near parks?
	•	Typical monthly rent for a modern, pet-friendly studio/1-bed?
	•	Housing traps to watch out for when renting (contract clauses, hidden fees, scams, subletting pitfalls)?
	•	Typical lease lengths, deposit norms, agent fees, and whether pet deposits are common.
	•	How’s sound insulation and winter heating in older (Jugendstil/pre-war) vs newer buildings? Any building types/streets you’d avoid?

	2.	Dog life
	•	Reliable 24/7 veterinary clinics and good regular vets? Do they speak English?
	•	Dog-friendly cafés/bars, parks, and any off-leash areas or dog groups I should know about.
	•	Anything to handle admin-wise for dogs after arriving (registration, microchip info, etc.)?

	3.	Nightlife & meeting people
	•	Is it easy to make a few local friends as a late-20s guy? Any expat or local meetups?
	•	Favorite bars/clubs/venues that aren’t just tourist traps.
	•	Sports or hobby communities (football, gym, hiking, language exchanges)?

	4.	Quality of life
	•	What do you love (and not love) about Riga day-to-day?
	•	Safety at night? Areas to avoid?
	•	Winter survival tips (gear, indoor activities, vitamin D, etc.).

	5.	Work
	•	Solid home internet and recommended ISPs?
	•	Good co-working spaces (quiet, phone booths, decent coffee)?

	6.	Things to do
	•	Weekend escapes (sea, forests, nearby towns), cultural events, museums, live music.
	•	Must-try local food spots and coffee.

	7.	Language
	•	How far will English get me for daily life?
	•	Is it more useful to learn basics of Latvian first, or does Russian help more in practice?

	8.	Utilities & bills
	•	Average monthly costs (winter vs summer) for heating, electricity, water, trash, and internet in a 1-bed near the center?

	9.	Banking & payments
	•	Do I need a local bank account, or are Revolut/Wise enough?
	•	Any card/cash quirks (contactless limits, cash-only spots, tips on paying rent/utilities)?

	10.	Mobile & internet
	•	Best mobile carriers for coverage (including eSIM support)? If possible, with unlimited gigas.
	•	Any truly unlimited home internet plans worth recommending/avoiding?

	11.	Safety
	•	Any areas/streets to avoid late at night?
	•	Common scams or nightlife pitfalls newcomers should know?

	12.	Cost of living
	•	Realistic monthly budget for a single person near the center (rent, groceries, gym, coworking, going out)?

My tentative plan
	•	Come for a year, settle near the center (or Old Town if that actually works day-to-day), and decide later whether to stay longer.
	•	I’ll be working remotely, so stable internet + quiet evenings matter, but I do want nightlife within reach.",3,1755275022.0,Riga,10,0.71,False

1mr2krw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogTrainingTips/comments/1mr2krw/mini_dachshund_issues/,Mini Dachshund Issues,"Hello, 

I’m currently at my wits end with my two year old female dachshund. I’m not sure if rehoming her is the best option as I cannot afford to fork out money for training sessions. I love her to death but she is the worst dog I’ve ever owned.

Some background: I’ve had her since she was 8 weeks old. She was raised using a ramp and a doggy door from the breeder I got her from. Since day one she has issues with potty training. She’s had a doggy door everywhere we’ve lived. There is no rhyme or reason why she will decide to go outside for the bathroom or inside the house on our beds, couches, mats, carpets, and clothing. She will use the bathroom in the morning when I take her out but unless I physically put her outside to go to the bathroom she will go in the house all she wants. My boyfriend and I just moved into a new apartment and are in the process of buying all things new (we had nothing) and she peed twice on our brand new bed that we had less than a week. We don’t even want to buy a couch or carpets because she has already peed so much on that last furniture that I’ve paid so much money to get it cleaned and we know she will do the same to anything we buy for the new apartment.

Not only does she have issues with the bathroom but she’s a very reactive dog. Does not like other dogs. Will not let other humans come up to her and if we have people over she will try to bite at their ankles. I have tried countless times to train her myself. I’ve bought clickers, collars, even gone back to the basics of taking her out every hour and praising her with high value treats with my boyfriend and I both acting like she just won the World Cup every time she goes outside but nothing works with her behavior. 

I’ve lost a lot of sleep over her and she wakes up in the middle of the night to run to the front door to bark at every little sound she hears. I’m completely lost on what to do. I wanted a dog I could at least take outside to sit and enjoy coffee with at a coffee shop and I can’t even do that so instead she has to stay inside most of the time but that’s not fair to her nor the life I wanted for her.
