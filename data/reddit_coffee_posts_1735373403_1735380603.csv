1ho20jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/comments/1ho20jl/what_learnings_would_you_share_for_fi/,What learnings would you share for FI,"My daughter’s boyfriend asked for my advice on how to become FI. I’ve shared what worked for me. Other learnings?

Have a clear goal, mine was a £2m portfolio by the time I’m 50, so I can then take £6k out per month for life with no mortgage.

Recently I hit my goals a little late with just over £2m in SIPP, VCT, ISA and offshore bonds. And my two houses are worth around £900k. This is what i did, you have to find your own path but I would recommend listening to people who have achieved the goals you set for yourself. 

1.	⁠Have the london/SE six figure job and buy the forever home early, somewhere a lot cheaper than london and dont keep moving. I bought in the Midlands with a london salary paid off the mortgage in 16 years. 
2.	⁠Every year fill up your pension and isa, and then pay off more on the mortgage. So you maximise the pension assistance from the government and your employer.
3.	⁠Look at the mix of pension contributions and other accounts such as ISA when it gets to around £700k (needs to be calculated based on your age and retirement aspirations), so you have a bridge to when your pension is available and consider any lifetime tax charges. 
4.	⁠Consolidate all your pensions, I had 3 smaller ones, all had minimum level fees and all were poorly invested, and if I had left them they would have made perhaps 30% return over 10 years with high fees.  I have a single SIPP now with total charges less than 1% and focus on a US weighted all world tracker, high risk as my belief is after disasters most funds fall back to a similar level and during the upside years you will get further ahead. 
5.	⁠Accept that this is a 20 year+ plan, as your money should double in size twice plus the extra contributions you make. 
6.	⁠Buy another house with a 100% mortgage, in an area that’s up and coming, something that’s a wreck and spend your weekends doing it up. So you can sell or rent this asset. I created my own 100% mortgage by finding the deposit from my main house equity (which has an offset mortgage). 
7.	⁠Don’t waste money, I have a cheap coffee machine at home with a choice of syrups and milks. I spend about 15p on a coffee that is Starbucks quality, and I would not dream of paying their prices. On the other hand I have paid £600 to stay in a hotel that was one of the most memorable days of my life. I spend on things that I value and don’t waste money. I also took the spare toilet roll, pens, paper etc home from the amazing hotel and used it to save money. When I go to corporate conferences they often give away sweets, biscuits, pads etc, at the end of the conferences i hoover up anything not taken and give them to my kids for snacks and their school work. I joined a free online course to count as a student so I get free Amazon prime. This is a mindset, make saving money fun and a challenge. Not because you have to save but because you enjoy the challenge. My partner and I laugh about the things we do to save money and have a competitive spirit on who is the tightest!
8.	⁠Read something like investors chronicle (free in my local library) to learn about equites, tax efficient wrappers like vct and off shore bonds, and their reader questions/expert answers which give a lot of ideas. As once you start to max out your pension and isa, you need other options. And they showed me how to do it all on one platform.

I think with today’s circumstances I could do this again. The key question is can you do the £100k+ job for 20 years, spend your weekends doing up a second house, keep your costs low, and will you invest your money smartly, or will you allow the system to give you poor returns, high costs and work till you drop in your late 60s?

I was motivated by seeing my dad work very hard all his life and die a month after retirement in his late 60s. He hadn’t done much for himself and was about to start living. So I also keep very fit and hope to live longer, semi retire in my 50s and pass on wealth to my kids. As I never left home with a penny from my parents, and I would like to help my children.

It's an inverted recipe, nothing new to me.

However, at the fifth step the plunger popped out, sending some of the wet grounds flying. I'm pretty sure it was because of CO2 releasing from my 2 week old roast. I also wasn't using double filter, so the resistance from the lid side of the aeropress shouldn't provide that much resistance. 
Since the amount of grounds out of the bounds of aeropress wasn't that great, I decided to continue with the recipe. In spite of my little fail the coffee tasted great (I'm using a light roast floral blend), so I'll definetly try this recipe again in the future.

How should I deal with the plunger popping out, by pushing it in further? Perhaps a longer bloom, than the recipe suggests could help release more CO2?",1,1735376760.0,AeroPress,1,1.0,False

1ho1u80,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ho1u80,Has TRT/HOT improved your quality of life? ,"I’ve been dealing with daily fatigue for over a year despite averaging 7-8 hours of sleep per night, following a health diet and regular exercise since 2017. I’ve benefited from using ashwagandha before work, using fadogia and Tongkat with coffee and creatine and boron as a pre workout, I’ve even benefited from rodiola for cardio. But none of this has helped my fatigue. The final thing I can do is work with my doctor to get me off my SSRI and try another form of anti depressant. I know TRT is an expensive lifelong commitment which is why I’ve avoided it but informed myself on it. I have six figures in assets and credit combined so funding TRT like kyzatrex isn’t an issue. The issue is preventing testicular atrophy and I’ve had testicular torsion when I was 19. I’m 25 now. Very young compared to the people who need TRT. But I feel like a zombie the second I wake up and often have to take a nap after my morning shower on my days off. I have a low libido, zero morning wood. I have trouble building muscle and I just don’t feel sexy. I can try emsculpt but I’m already lean for American standards (15% body fat). Has TRT improved anyone’s quality of life? I’m very young and the insurance I have won’t pay for it. I use tretinoin for anti aging, maybe TRT is next. I’ll have to see what happens after dropping my SSRI for another anti depressant. I’ll never quit anti depressants because I have clinical depression and they’ve helped me. I just want to feel energetic, be able to focus on my tasks and feel sexy/confident.

Sometimes on weekends if I didn't score some chick at the club I'd check the local escort website for some available ""action"". So one time I find this woman offering professional massages with happy endings. Nice. I visit her once, everything is cool, she's friendly, professional, hot AF, in lingerie, maybe 10+ years older than me. During maybe next 5 years (I'm not really sure about the timeline) I visit her once in a while maybe like 10 times. Handjobs, BJs, a couple times even sex. She has all kinds of massage certificates on the wall so I know her full name.

Some time passes, I went through BS relationship and had no time for such activities. Once I find this girl on Tinder. Kinda chubby, but interesting and cute as fuck. We meet for some coffee, chat on whatsapp every day until one night she writes she's at her mom's place (like 2 AM) and needs to get home, so I offer to pick her up.

I want to tell them so many things, but it can backfire in ways i don’t comprehend. I try to use words that are used if you are in the ‘truth’ because i’m scared they can label me an apostate if i’m to distant from there terminology.

I want to tell my dad who is an elder that i have so much fear to lose them. That i never felt like i could speak to them about everything even as a child i could not be open to them because of the fear how it wil backfire on me because of being a witness. 

At this point i’d rather lose everybody and be done with this then having to rattle my way around them. I’m fearful that one day i say something that have them label me as apostate. So i constantly have to avoid that and its tiring. Even if its all in my head i can’t find a way to not give a fck about it.

There is a change my dad is pimo, but the signals are mixed :(
My dad let me listen to conversation he had with an elder on the phone about a situation in the cong involving other elders, that was a major step in my waking up. When i went with him in the ministry it was more coffee then doors, even my mum ( super-pimi ) know he doesnt do much. Once he said he wonders how he’s life would be if he hadnt become a witness and if its not better to not know the ‘truth’. When the GB said some confusing stuff i told him and he said, well they have to make up something to not be silent about it. I have doubted that my dad is maybe pimo after connecting all these dots.
All these things were helping me to wake up. 

But then he did something i class as very pimi, maybe im wrong. 
When i had a girlfriend he told the body of elders and they wanted to meet with me because they were so worried about me. This made me believe that maybe he is a pimi and not a pimo. 

Sometimes i think if its not better to lose all my family and life my live without worrying about this, im just scared that once i take this step there is no way back and i regret it later.",1,1735375163.0,exjw,1,0.67,False

The Last Day

Lucien Graft floated aimlessly through an empty void. Memories danced at the edges of his consciousness, hazy and surreal.

Where am I? How did I get here? Is this a dream?

His life flashed before him—not as a montage of triumphs, but a dreary sequence of long office hours, cold takeout dinners, and the faint hum of fluorescent lights. No friends to call his own, no family beyond his mother, whose memories had long been claimed by her illness. His existence had been an endless loop of monotony.

That’s right… God, my life sucks. Maybe this is some kind of stress dream?

The thought brought the last memory into focus. He was at his desk, staring blankly at the clock, counting down the hours until another wasted day was over. A yawn, a stretch, a knock of his elbow—then the lukewarm coffee spilled across his desk, dripping into the exposed power strip below. A spark. A flash. Pain so fleeting he barely registered it.

Wait… am I dead? From a crappy cup of office coffee? Really?!

A voice answered, interrupting his spiraling thoughts.

“Yep. Dead as a doornail. Sorry about that.”

Lucien spun, or at least he felt like he did—there was no ground, no body. Before him materialized a man seated on a grand marble throne. His attire was… odd. A blend of gaudy and regal, like a businessman who’d won the lottery and couldn’t decide between power or flair. The throne was surrounded by an endless expanse of clouds and a fading sunset that didn’t seem to belong to any particular horizon.

“Who—what—are you?” Lucien stammered.

The man smirked, leaning forward. “I am Lulutera. A god, as you mortals call us. And… well, I hate to admit it, but your untimely death was my bad.”

“Your bad?! I died because of you?!”

Lulutera raised a hand to cut him off. “Look, I said I was sorry. It was an accident—honestly, I thought the fire suppression in that office was better. Humans and their safety codes…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “Anyway! I’m here to make it up to you.”

Lucien folded his arms, skeptical. “And how exactly do you plan to fix this?”

“Well, I can’t send you back—your body’s… well, let’s not dwell on that. But I can offer you a new life. A better one, in a new world! Think of it as… reincarnation, with perks.”

Lucien stared, his disbelief mounting. “I had a life, you know. A crappy one, sure, but it was mine.”

“Did you, though? No friends, no real family to miss you—and you hated your job. I’m doing you a favor here. So what’ll it be? Rebirth, or the afterlife? I warn you, limbo’s a bit crowded these days.”

Damn, he’s not wrong. Lucien exhaled sharply. “Fine. I’ll bite. What’s the catch?”

“No catch!” Lulutera snapped his fingers, and a massive spinning wheel appeared, filled with thousands of cryptic symbols and images. “Just spin the Wheel of Reincarnation to find your new form. I’ll even throw in a blessing. Go on, give it a whirl.”

Lucien looked from the wheel to Lulutera and back again, his annoyance bubbling. “This is a joke, right?”

“Do I look like I joke?” Lulutera replied, deadpan, though the faint smirk undermined his words.

Reluctantly, Lucien stepped forward and spun the wheel. It turned for what felt like an eternity, Lulutera humming a jaunty tune as it clicked past options like “Moss Sprite,” “Stone Golem,” and “Royal Griffin.” Finally, the wheel slowed, its pointer settling on an image of a dark, flaming bird.

“Whoa!” Lulutera exclaimed, clapping his hands. “You’ve hit the jackpot! The legendary Ebonflame Phoenix. Not only are you the first of your kind, but you’re also bound to shake things up in your new world. They’ll never see you coming.”

“A phoenix? Seriously?” Lucien grimaced. “Can’t you make me human or something?”

“Boring! Besides, this body has so much potential. Trust me, you’ll thank me later.” Lulutera snapped his fingers again. The ground beneath Lucien vanished, sending him plummeting toward an endless sky.

“Wait! What about my blessing—?!” His scream was cut off as black flames engulfed him, reshaping his body into a fiery egg, solidified in a cocoon of smoldering ash.

The New World

The village of Ardentwood had known peace for generations, nestled in the shadow of the Emberstone Mountains. But in recent months, the winds carried whispers of unease. Monsters grew bold, attacking in waves that even seasoned adventurers struggled to repel. The skies seemed darker, the forests quieter—a foreboding stillness that set even the most stoic farmers on edge.

It was on one such uneasy evening that a fiery streak tore across the heavens, crashing into a field just outside the village. Farmers gathered warily, weapons in hand, only to find a smoldering crater—and within it, a blackened, glowing egg, pulsing with an ominous warmth.

Word spread quickly. Some whispered it was a blessing, others a curse. But one thing was certain: the world would never be the same.

Just to share a quick story from yesterday, and see if anyone has had similar experiences. 

Me and my partner headed to Starbucks after our monthly Costco shop. This is like our little tradition. I ordered my usual drink - Decaff Caramel Macchiato with Oat Milk, and my partner did the same. Weirdly enough this time, we had to wait 5-6 minutes between the first drink arriving and the second drink arriving. My partner insisted that I took the first one, so I waited until their one arrived, then we took them away with us as we sit and enjoy a view of the countryside with the drinks.

As soon as I had finished my drink, I instantly felt something was wrong. Just this hot, dizzy and nauseous feeling came over me and within 10 minutes I was violently sick, like projectile vomiting my whole coffee at the side of the road. 

We have contacted the branch via email to have this investigated.

Quick question I’m hoping you might be able to help me with. 

My son (6) plays Minecraft. He got a new iPad for his Christmas present. 

He was excited to play with me so I made an account and downloaded Minecraft on my phone. 

I created a realm?, it costs £2.99 a month or something. 

I invited him to the world / realm thing I created and we started building things together. Well I’ve just got up and he asked if we can play Minecraft, I need a coffee so I told him to get onto the world I created and I’ll join in a bit. I can’t see it on his iPad, so can’t join it without me? I logged on quickly and joined the realm myself, then invited him. He joined and I logged off. He’s now happily sitting next to me playing on this world / realm thing I created without me in the game. 

How can I make it so he can just join the world / realm thing I created, without me needing to be present?",1,1735374718.0,Minecraft,1,1.0,False

I'm in the midst of my second 50+ day streak and I'm having trouble with diet. For context, I quit coffee cold turkey after drinking two cups a day at least for maybe 4 years and ever since then I have felt more calm and less stressed but my sugar and unhealthy food cravings have gone up dramatically. Even eating relatively bad I have lost probably a pound in the last month, but I'm 6 ft 182 pounds and 16 percent body fat. 

It's so strange to me how I can sit in bed or just be going about my life and feel sexual urges and resist them for long periods of time, yet I can not resist my food cravings. 

I also have trouble because in the past when I have struggled with weight, I have used sexual thoughts to fuel my efforts in the gym and in resisting glutinous foods. I.e looking at crushes on instagram and then going to the gym like a psycho with her in my head. Does anyone do that while on SR? I've been trying to avoid lust and stay in my own world but it's obviously quite difficult and I'm not sure if I'm transmuting properly because basically only when I think about girls do I feel the super insane energy.

I came down to take care of my dad (87) because he’s got mobility issues and is on a walker. I’m not particularly close to my parents, so not involved with their care or everyday lives, and I live several hours away. 

2 years ago, my dad had a TIA, but my mom did not tell him, take him to the hospital, or tell his doctor. She instead gave him whiskey and coffee (a home remedy for stroke, she said!) A week later, I was visiting, and told me, and I insisted she tell the doctor. A week after that, she did tell the doctor and he suggested an MRI, which they declined. At the time I was visiting, my dad seemed “normal” to me, looking back on it he was probably already experiencing dementia but has always had a stubborn, demanding, and argumentative personality, so it’s hard to tell! Also, my mom has always waited on him hand and foot, so it’s not unusual for him to be unable to get a cup of tea or operate any sort of household appliance. 

Now I’m here taking care of him, and my mom isn’t around, it is clear he has more than “mild cognitive impairment”. He asks at least 15 times a day when mom is coming home, and often calls me by my cousin’s name. He’s obsessed with driving to McDonalds and sees that as the solution (i.e. he thinks he will drive himself to McDonalds and eat there 3 times a day until my mom comes home). My mom does let him drive occasionally but he doesn’t actually want to, and she says he doesn’t know 
where he’s going and she has to remind him and give him step by step directions. I’m really questioning my mom’s decision-making abilities but that’s a story for a different day. 

I did take him to his Dr’s today to get evaluated so we could get help through the VA and the doctor connected us with a social worker but didn’t schedule any cognitive tests or follow ups. Should I push for a formal diagnosis or testing? Does he need that to be admitted to a memory care facility? I don’t want to waste resources on testing or cause further upset for my dad (it was a difficult day for us) if I don’t need to. 

Also, should I insist on screening for my mom as well? She has the right to make her own decisions, as does he, but she seems to have some memory lapses of her own and she did initially come home from the hospital AMA to take care of my dad, which caused me a bunch of stress because I had to take her back and have her readmitted and sent to rehab! In other words, her decisions are seemingly putting both their health and safety at risk. ",1,1735374359.0,dementia,0,1.0,False

About Me
With 17+ years in production/security incident management, project, and program management, I work in an organization that heavily utilizes public cloud environments. That experience definitely helped during my CCSP journey.

Exam Experience
I found CCSP more challenging than CISSP, but the elimination technique was my savior. For tough questions, I narrowed it down to two options, then re-read the question 2-3 times to make the right choice. I completed the exam 40 minutes ahead of time.

Study Resources
Here’s what I used:

Destination CCSP (Kindle)

CCSP Cloud Guardians (Kindle)

Prashant Mohan’s Cirrus Notes

LearnZ App (1000 Questions)

Packet Prep (862 Questions)

SkillCertPro CCSP Master Cheat Sheet

CCSP Last Minute Guide by Mike Chapple

Prabh Nair’s Coffee Talks

Pete Zerger’s CCSP Cram Slides


Key Takeaway
None of the practice questions resembled the real exam, and ISC2 deserves kudos for maintaining high standards.

Good luck to everyone preparing—you’ve got this!

They’re versatile, stylish, and functional, making them a must-have piece for any space. Whether you’re looking for extra seating, a cozy footrest, or a decorative accent, a [pouf](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) can fit seamlessly into your design. But with so many options available, how do you choose the perfect **pouf** for your living room? Here’s your guide to picking one that complements your style and enhances your space.

# 1. Define Your Living Room Style

Before choosing a **pouf**, consider the overall aesthetic of your living room. Is it modern, bohemian, minimalist, or traditional? The design of the pouf should align with your existing decor to create a cohesive look.

* **Modern Style**: Opt for sleek, neutral-toned poufs with clean lines. Leather or velvet finishes work well in contemporary spaces.
* **Bohemian Style**: Choose poufs made of natural materials like jute, rattan, or macramé, with bold patterns or earthy colors.
* **Minimalist Style**: Look for understated pouf designs in monochromatic colors or muted tones.
* **Traditional Style**: Go for poufs with classic details, like tufted upholstery or decorative stitching.

# 2. Consider the Functionality

How you plan to use your **pouf** will determine the ideal size, material, and design:

The material of your **pouf** affects both its appearance and durability. Here are some popular options:

* **Fabric Poufs**: Perfect for cozy and relaxed living rooms, these are available in various colors and patterns.

* **Jute or Rattan Poufs**: Great for eco-friendly or rustic designs, they pair beautifully with natural decor elements.

# 4. Match the Size to Your Space

The size of your **pouf** should be proportionate to your living room and its furniture.

* In smaller living rooms, opt for a compact pouf that doesn’t overwhelm the space.
* In larger spaces, you can experiment with oversized poufs or multiple poufs arranged in a group.

For a balanced look, ensure the pouf’s height complements your sofa or chairs, especially if you’re using it for [pouf seating](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) or as a footrest.

# 5. Coordinate Colors and Patterns

The color and pattern of your pouf should harmonize with your living room’s palette.

* **Neutral Poufs**: Ideal for blending seamlessly into any decor style.
* **Bold Colors**: A vibrant pouf can act as a statement piece, adding energy and character to the room.
* **Patterns and Prints**: Stripes, geometric designs, or bohemian patterns can bring visual interest to your space.

Visit **home interior stores** to explore a variety of pouf designs and find the one that best suits your living room’s aesthetic.

# 6. Explore Poufs for Living Room Storage

Some [poufs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) come with hidden storage, making them a functional choice for smaller spaces. These storage poufs can hold blankets, magazines, or remote controls while serving as seating or a footrest.

# 7. Layer Your Living Room Design with Poufs

Poufs aren’t just standalone pieces—they can be layered with other furniture to create a dynamic look.

* Pair your pouf with a soft area rug for added texture.
* Use multiple poufs of varying sizes to create a casual seating arrangement.
* Place a tray on a flat pouf to double it as a coffee table.

# 8. Shop Smart at Home Interior Stores
