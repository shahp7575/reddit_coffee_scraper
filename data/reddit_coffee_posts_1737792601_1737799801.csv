1i9jvh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1i9jvh5/feel_like_out_of_the_walking_dead/,feel like out of the walking dead,"I was wondering which tag and flair to use an realised this post will be a little bit of everything. Truth is, I’ve been feeling absolutely defeated the past week. I’ve been dealing with the worst eczema flare up I’ve had since probably ever. 

I used to get really bad eczema on the insides of my elbows as a kid. But that was it. However, I’ve lived a life full of allergies: constant sneezing (always worse in the mornings), devilish throat scratching, ear itching, hives, hay fever, oral allergies, etc. I’ve never really had any (apparent) food allergies, at least not anything that would send me into anaphylactic shock. However, the more I’ve learnt about health the more I’ve realised how it is all connected (duh) and despite being a horrible condition to live with, it’s also pretty damn amazing how our bodies work, and how they’re trying to tell us something, even when we think they’re the enemy. 

I believe this particular flare up was initially caused by an extremely hard and emotional time I went through with my mother. Lots of resurfacing trauma and hours of endless crying. The following day from that I woke up with allergies and feeling itchy and I knew it was the start of something. The allergies and (what now I see as mild) itching continued for about a month until my skin finally started feeling leathery, red, and hellish. I’m so scared of TSW that I decided to go the natural route and went to a naturopath, who did some testing and it turns out I’m allergic to dairy, gluten, coffee, and most things that are commonly inflammatory for most people anyway. She sent me this syrup that helped cleanse the liver, and within a week, my eczema got worse, especially around my eyes and forehead. I had heard that according to TCM, anything manifesting  around your eyes had to do with the liver, and what was I taking? Medicine to help cleanse it. Something clicked. Then I was re-listening to the Medical Medium Eczema Podcast and bam, he said that all skin issues like eczema, psoriasis, acne, etc, stem from… THE LIVER. So okay, great. My liver is flushing out shit and it’s manifesting through my skin. I get that. But I feel like shit every day, seriously feel like I don’t want to even exist. Waking up is the WORST, the moment I feel myself gaining consciousness I’m like “oh no…” and this overwhelming feeling of dread takes over me, just thinking “how will I look today? will my eyes be swollen? will my scabs be bleeding? what will it be?” 

 It’s now January 25th, this all started back in November. I have now a flare up going all across my chest, and wounds all over my face from scratching while asleep. I genuinely feel like a zombie, straight out of The Walking Dead. But I feel positive somehow. I didn’t a few days ago, I cried for hours and told my partner I didn’t want to do this anymore. And I don’t know about you fellow eye eczema sufferers, but crying is the most liberating yet worst thing that could happen, see, the SALT IN MY FUCKING TEARS BURNS MY SKIN. lol. The irony. 

Anyway, I have some tallow balm coming in the mail that I’m very excited for as I’ve read amazing things about it. I’m lowkey a bit scared it won’t work on my for some reason, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there. And finally made an appointment with my doctor on Monday. After reading posts in this beautiful community I figured I need to take A solution. Even if it’s just to treat the symptom, and while the symptom is not taking my life away, I can work on long term solutions. But it’s difficult to do it when you’re itching, scabby, bleeding and sad. So, I’m willing to try steroids for a bit, and while I get better I will implement serious changes in my lifestyle, my diet, my mental health. It’s worth a shot. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still feeling dead on the inside but a bit better than yesterday? There’s a tiny light of hope at the end of the tunnel and I will walk miles if needed to get to it.

There was never anything romantic between us, but when we decided to share an apartment, she noticed me bringing girls home, and I guess something changed. All of a sudden, she was no longer the tomboy I've always known her to be. She appeared to be getting more and more flustered in front of me, whereas in the past, she would've been proud to burp loud enough for the coffee in my cup to ripple, and then playfully punch me or something for not congratulating her monumental mouth farts. 

As soon as the people that I slept with eventually left the following morning, my friend would not stop teasing me about how weird it was for her to unsee me as just her friend because our roommate situation was now forcing her to also see me as a guy who had random girls in my room from time to time. I noticed that my friend gradually became more keen to cook for me, which was kind of out of character for her, but I was not complaining. She also complimented me whenever we dressed up to go out or whatever, which was also new, because she used to just look at me like I was her uncool older brother. 

I had no idea what was happening, so I asked random strangers on Reddit to tell me what's going on. Reddit said my friend wanted me. I believed Reddit and began questioning if I wanted her. I came to the conclusion that I did. However, it took me fucking forever to actually admit to myself that I did in fact have romantic feelings for my friend. By the time I was finally prepared to tell her, it was too late. She hooked up with an Australian while she was on vacation. I watched their romance blossom on the Australian guy's social media because my friend never posted couples content. I convinced myself that it was nothing serious. 

I messaged my friend and teased her for apparently being involved with an Aussie guy who looked exactly like the type of guys she always said she would never go for. She messaged me back saying ""I know, I know, totally not my type, but like, he showed me the scar on his thigh from a fucking crocodile bite, and I was like, penetrate me now Croc Daddy."" That message included a million emojis to express the range of emotions she was experiencing because of this guy. My friend has been dating Croc Daddy ever since. I doubt she has any idea that I'm low key attracted to her, and I'm still not 100% sure if she really did have feelings for me because I took too fucking long to open my mouth and communicate.

**TL:DR Took too long to tell my friend that I was attracted to her, and now it's too late because my friend is dating a guy who's so Australian, he fought a fucking crocodile, and won.**",1,1737799239.0,tifu,0,1.0,False
1i9jsuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1i9jsuv/mechanical_playtest_session_43_results/,Mechanical Playtest Session 4/3 Results,"Heyo hiyo!

All righty, so I've finished the last ""full mechanical Playtest"" session! Why 4/3? Well, initially *I thought* it'd be done in 2 (with 1 for chargen testing) but there was a mid-playtest adjustment that drew us out an extra week. That's okay, it resulted in pretty good stuff!

# Session 4: Testing the Audience Mechanics

Oh boy, this went pretty great on a first actual-play evaluation! Let's break it down:

* Since last session was testing ""Engaging a \[Boss Monster\] while under equipped/prepared,"" which went approximately as intended from my end: The party either TPKs or has to retreat, but there is sufficient information to the Player-Heroes that *were they prepared for the fight, it'd be definitively winnable*. Additionally, I was able to confirm that the fight *was winnable in the current party state*, except it would be *an incredibly challenging prospect*. This is all intended, as this is more ""Combat is War"" I suppose, although I internally pose it as ""Engaging in Combat is a question the Party has legitimate reason to ask *before* engaging Bonk.""
* Due to 2/4 Player-Heroes dying in the last Playtest (because they stuck around longer than they should have), they were reverted to 1/2 Health and 1 Wound from Death \[For those curious, Health represents cuts/bruises/minor injuries that accumulate toward incapacitation, but Wounds are long-term debilitations that determine if a person *dies* at 0 Health; Health recovers with rest, Wounds require Chirurgery efforts\]
* We doled out a few points of Fatigue to accommodate the week-long travel to Valefort, the local Capital and setting for the last mechanic to be play-tested.
* Did a bit of Skill Checks for the Druid/Healer in the party, who managed to put the party back together  for the most part over the course of a day. This worked nice and buttery smooth.
* During the Chirurgery efforts, the other party members requested an Audience with the Marquis with a one day delay.
* Party spent their one-free day to Prepare for the Audience: Carousing in taverns and alehouses whilst talking loudly about beating up some cultists and hunting for reactions (Carouse); Prowling the streets hunting for information about banditry work and such (Streetwise); Gaining access to various Court Records to evaluate the level and type of biases for the Court (Statecraft); Going to chat up the local Guards about *who* they are going to be Petitioning (Guard Profession reduced difficulty Command)
* Party had 3 successful endeavors, finding out word on the street was banditry work was on the rise due to a sour harvest giving cause to take from others if easy, Court Records revealed the Marquis and Advisors had a preference toward the northern regions of the kingdom (Events took place in the south), and the Guards chatted a bit with one of their own about the various members (Marquis, Spiritual Adviser, Scout/Commerce, and Military, some Proud and others Pragmatic)
* The next day, the Party engaged the Audience.
   * They made Introductions, and found the Court was Open (Normal Difficulty) with moderate Concerns (3) about the request for an Audience. The Merchant character made a Courtesy Check and was able to assuage some Concerns (3 -> 2) and re-phrase their petition to make the Court more Agreeable (1 Net Success from Party to gain full Support).
   * The Audience begins.
      * Merchant and Guard decide to push their Petition, whilst the Farmer and Laborer decide they are best served hanging back and trying to smooth any foibles through Diplomatic Recovery (if needed, else just vibe).
      * Guard fails to make an impact (0 Successes), but the Merchant hits a Opening on the Spiritualist *and* scores a Heroic Success (3 Successes)!
      * Court poses some Concerns about ""Bumpkins jumping at Grumpkins"", stretched resources, and that the Laklunders are raising warnings of a great threat but not stating *what* that threat was. In the end, the Court's Concerns only count against 2 Successes (reducing the Party to 1 Net Success).
      * Happily for the Party, this ends with their petition efforts *still* pushing them up to a tier and garnering *Full Court Support*.
   * The Court decides to spend a few available resources to help secure the local townships and keep the road safe for trade and travel, whilst also noting the beat up state of the Party; each Party member is gifted an item (Coppered Quarterstaff for Guard, Tower Shield for Laborer, a Fine Fur Cloak for the Merchant, and totem bound with a Spirit for Convocation to the Druid) as both reward for their valiant efforts, but also to help them better secure their own homes.
* That ended the Mechanical Playtest.

# Playtester Immediate Feedback

Feedback was surprisingly limited overall, in a good way! It mainly was focused on a few different points, as well as one (what I'll call) 'Hard Perception Issue':

1. (Myself) Travel mechanics were functional but had some clunk. I'm going to re-evaluate and smooth out some roughness.
2. The Audience Mechanics were raved about, even though they went for only 1 round. All the Players immediately responded with ""Oh shit, we totally see how this does things and is *SO NICE* compared to D&D/PF One-Roll-and-Done style stuff!"" They especially loved the (optional) ability to try to research targeted points and information before the Audience, and how they were effectively doing an super granular Opposed Check instead of a Combat-type feel.
3. There was a note that Fatigue feels better to count *up* from zero to max, rather than down; This makes it feels consistent with building *up* Exhaustion once Fatigue is full.
4. There was a discussion about removing Fatigue entirely, which by the end of discussion may be solved: Remove Fatigue, and only deal in Exhaustion but implement the Wizard's Staff concept based on Basic Role-Play (e.g. Quarterstaff/Wand is specially crafted to store 3x Recovery Rate worth of Energy, that is expended when casting Spells *before* the caster gains Exhaustion/Debilitation/Harm)
5. The most interesting part of feedback was a long discussion with a single play-tester vs me and the rest: The pre-stated ""Low/No-Win Boss Fight"" of last session bothered them since they struggled to understand how it was winnable.
   1. There were multiple aspects here: First was concern that having a spell on their character sheet felt bad they only had 30% to cast it in combat (they did *not* spec into it at all). They were exclusively a D&D5e player, and thought it was effectively a 0-Level Cantrip. This misperception was corrected, and other playtesters pointed out that if they'd put any focus in the spell it'd be much more useful to their character. This was conceded on secondary assessment by the player.
   2. The player also asked *how I saw a way to win the unexpected (and intentionally over-aimed Boss Fight); I pointed out that they actually damaged the Demon's Armor, but didn't follow through to negate it, that it had roughly the same HP as them but just higher defense, and that it's two noted abilities (Health Recovery and Invisibility) were random chance occurrences (that obviously were not in their favor).* The other playtesters pointed out that *I* specifically stated, *in no uncertain terms*, this fight was at the upper tier of difficulty *and* their characters were not prepared for it (I was performing a test that Boss Encounters were tuned toward needing knowledge/prep, and that retreat is an option).
   3. When asked how to fight something that is Invisible, and the difficulties it poses (by this player), I pointed out they used their wolfhound companion to sniff it out and point its position (reducing the effect of Invisibility for multiple party-members). I also noted they were by a bone-fire, and could have easily tossed ash at it to make it semi-visible. The Player's response was primarily: ""Huh, I guess. That makes sense, I just am not used to thinking about things like that since I mainly play crunchy board games."" (So this means, I think I have a bit of OSR design in me?)
   4. The Player also felt that combat was Deadly, which I considered, acknowledged, and realized that since the Gear Treadmill isn't *really* part of **The Hero's Call** (since it's not a D&D-like or other looter game) that I could adjust that easily with chargen and starter gear. All players agreed it made sense that a Smith Guard (who typically wears Coat of Plates) should be able to start with Coat of Plate armor and such. This is easy to adjust, since the goal is: ""Dangerous, but not Deadly"" level of combat; for clarity, the intent is for major Combat to be Dangerous to engage in, but not Deadly by default.
   5. Other Play-testers noted that part of the difficulty with the Boss Fight (last week) was multiple points converging: 1) Players were D&D5e and PF mindset players (Combat is Sport, No Retreat), 2) The Playtesters were too focused on Damage (Boss Combat is more a Puzzle than a Sponge), and 3) the characters were woefully unprepared and unknowledgeable to what they faced (Witcher 3 Monster Contracts were used as a reference point).
6. Overall, the general results regarding Combat was ""If it's Mundane, it seems like it is generally achievable"" and ""If it's Monstrous, we should try to be prepared as possible, or allow ourselves to run if needed.""
7. There was a request to evaluate more Mundane Tier combat, which is intended to ""Be a Threat if you're caught off-guard or get too cocky"" type of stuff. A Pack of Wolves might retreat if one is killed, a duet of armored Knights might retreat if Wounded or Armor Broken, etc. But there was a curiosity to test Mundane further to get a feel for the ""more common"" types of Combat, when it occurs.
8. There was a short discussion about Travel, Rations, and Torches with an immediately actionable result: During Travel (Going from Known A to Known B) the various resources of Travel/Expeditions are taken as a Party Pool as appropriate. Example: If Theophania, Jurgen, and Brocksen all have 8 total Ration Quantity but Keagan doesn't have any, then when the Quartermaster has an Event whilst Traveling they make a Check vs. 8 Rations for *everyone*. A Fail is -4 Rations (1 per character) but a Success is -2 (1/2 per character). Although as I type this I think I can do better and have it -1 Ration/Success (Levels of Success system) allowing a fantastic Quartermaster to spread 1 Ration across 4 party members effectively.
9.  The Playtesters universally want 1D100 for Skills rather than a unified 1D20 for Skill/Trait/Resource (2D10 fills Trait/Resource now) because it feels better on the mental math (They know exactly % of success rather than X/20 success). This surprised me, but is totally fine and a minor adjustment.
10. It turns out, *Pendragon* really hits something special. But that is *special for particular people because it drives character actions;* the Play-testers *really* liked having a set of Traits that they could **try** to call upon to juice their Skill Checks, as well as how Traits then also become a driver for a *wide* variety of Conditions without having to be a distinct mechanical *thing*. This continued into Audiences and beyond, where a Play-Tester felt that Role-Play was 'natural' and 'rewarding' by either playing to their base instincts or becoming Conflicted to push their character to 'Stand Up' to the situation despite a penalty on Skills. (This was honestly better than I'd expected, and they really dug into it and found it freeing in the sense they could approach 'how to play' their character in a more sensible way from what they reported.""
11. Other various adjustments through the month (self or player noted):
   1. Bows were given an adjustment: Hunting Bow is -1D6 Damage, but Long Bow is full Weapon Damage at higher range but slower fire rate. This actually had no impact in the Playtest, but was a consistency adjustment.
   2. Professions in Character Creation now provide a +10% Skill increase, rather than +5% as before. This is a self imposition based on the first session this month, to give players a wider boost and diversity of Skills they naturally consider... \*hurk\*... *viable*.
      1. This means the average Profession takes about 7 terms (28 years) to '*max out*' in the chargen process. So You'll be 43 and kinda sad about it, which is perfect.
   3. A Player can now ""buy"" an Apprenticeship in a Career Path during Chargen!
      1. By spending 1 Wealth, a character can take 1 Term in a Career Path (of their preferred Profession, or focus) as normal. Each subsequent Term in that Career/Profession requires either a Difficult Apprenticeship Check to stay in or 1 Wealth to 'buy' another term.
      2. The Playtesters unanimously agreed this is a super fun idea, since it gives a background aspect ('Ah yes, well... My *father* was quite well connected, you know') and comes with a **hard** opportunity cost: having even a few points of Wealth was determined to be significantly impactful, so sacrificing Wealth to gain some Skills and get Older is a big decision. But it allows someone who has **a pure vision of their character** to kinda 'force' that vision to fruition. Which is, honesty, a great idea and I love it.

TL;DR:

This was a great playtest! Overall, I seem to have hit **at or near the mark** of my intent in *most of my goals* that have been tested so far. Play-testers, primarily D&D5e and PF1/2E players, found the *vast majority* of **The Hero's Call** was a fun experience, felt good to play, and gave them some excitement! There are some things the smooth-out (Mainly Travel), some PDF clarity to provide (Give a Pre-Amble section that gives a Player-Hero a heads up of what Skills help with Which Thing), and some perceptive confusion about the scale of Combat (although that will be continuously tested to make it right).

There is going to be an additional Playtest in (hopefully) two months or so, but I have enough notes and *corrections* based on feedback to create my RED ORC (REference Document, ORC License) and re-compile **this playtest** into what will likely be the *Starter Set/Convention Package*. Between the two, probably the Latter!

1i9jnjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1i9jnjz/quiet_life_pt_2/,Quiet Life Pt 2,"Marcus stared at the television, his eyes glazed over. The laugh track of a sitcom played in the background, a jarring juxtaposition to the horror he had wrought. The alcohol had been a crutch, a way to silence the taunts of his past and the noise of his present. But now, it was a liability. He couldn't risk the fog of a hangover, not with the police so close.

He went to the kitchen and filled a glass with water, downing it in one gulp. The cold liquid did little to soothe his parched throat, but it was a start. As he set the glass down, he caught his reflection in the window. The man staring back at him was a ghost, a mere shadow of who he once was. His hand trembled, and he clenched it into a fist to steady himself. He had to get a grip. The whiskey bottle was still there, on the floor, a silent sentinel to his descent.

He decided to clean the kitchen, hoping the repetitive motions would help clear his head. As he wiped down the counters, he noticed a smear of blood, a grim souvenir of his nocturnal escapade. Panic surged through him, and he grabbed a clean cloth, scrubbing furiously at the stain. The smell of bleach filled the room, a harsh contrast to the lingering scent of whiskey. He had to be thorough. He had to be careful.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus, feeling the weight of his recent actions, sits in his cleaned kitchen, watching a sitcom to distract from his guilt. His trembling hand and the whiskey bottle on the floor serve as stark reminders of his struggle. A police welfare check looms, prompting him to clean up a bloodstain, symbolizing his attempt to cover his tracks and maintain a semblance of normalcy amidst the horror.

Once the kitchen was spotless, Marcus went to the living room and sat on the couch, his eyes darting around the room. The TV played on, the laughter a hollow echo of the joy that had once filled this space. The walls seemed to whisper of his dark secrets, threatening to give him away. He knew he couldn't stay here, not with the bodies of Larry and Tiffany hidden in plain sight.

He needed an alibi, a foolproof way to account for his whereabouts during the time of the murders. His thoughts turned to his old drinking buddies, the ones he had pushed away when his addiction took over. Could he trust them to cover for him? Or would they be the first to suspect? He picked up his phone, his thumb hovering over the contacts. The screen was a blur, his mind racing with possibilities.

He scrolled through the numbers, each name a potential lifeline. Finally, he settled on one: Dave. They hadn't spoken in months, but Marcus knew he owed him a favor. He took a deep breath and dialed, his heart pounding in his chest. The phone rang once, twice, three times before a sleepy voice answered.

""Dave, it's me, Marcus,"" he whispered, the words sticking in his throat. ""Look, I need your help. Something happened last night."" He paused, his mind racing. ""I was at your place, okay? We had a few drinks, and I crashed on your couch. You don't remember because you passed out. That's my story, alright?""

SUMMARY^1: Marcus contemplates the necessity of an alibi, fearful of the police investigation. He decides to use his old drinking buddy, Dave, as a cover. He calls him, creating a false story about being at Dave's place during the murders, hoping the lie will hold and provide the necessary distance from the suspicion that looms.

There was silence on the other end, and for a moment, Marcus feared he had made a mistake. Then, a sigh. ""Alright, man. Whatever you say. But you owe me big time.""

The words were a lifeline, a semblance of safety in a world that was quickly spiraling out of control. Marcus hung up, his hand shaking. He had bought himself some time, but it was only a matter of when, not if, the truth would come out. The silence of the house was a ticking clock, each second bringing him closer to discovery.

He had to act quickly. He needed to move the bodies, to make it look like an accident. His mind raced with the possibilities, the plans forming like shadows in the corners of his thoughts. He knew the neighborhood well, the old factory that had been abandoned for years, the river that flowed through the outskirts, a convenient disposal site for those who knew where to look.

Marcus took a deep breath, steeling himself for what was to come. The sun was rising, casting long shadows across the floor. The house was waking up, the day stretching out before him like a prison sentence. He had to be smart, had to be careful. But as he stood up from the couch, his legs felt like lead. The weight of his actions pressed down on him, threatening to crush him beneath its inescapable gravity.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus calls his old friend Dave, establishing a false alibi for the night of the murders. He knows the truth can't stay buried forever, and the pressure builds as he considers his next move. The house's silence is a ticking clock, and he plans to relocate the bodies, aiming for a convincing accident scenario. The rising sun is a stark reminder of the dawning reality of his situation, weighing heavily on his shoulders.

He took one last look around the room, memorizing every detail, every potential clue. Then, with a resigned sigh, he turned off the TV and made his way to the basement. The water in the tub was still, a crimson pool that reflected the horror of his actions. Larry's body lay in the water, lifeless, a grotesque parody of peace. Marcus knew he had to act, had to keep moving. The whispers of guilt grew louder, but he pushed them down, focusing on the task at hand.

With trembling hands, he reached into the tub and began to untie the knots that held the cushions in place. The water was warm and sticky, the cushions heavy with the weight of death. He pulled them free, the water gurgling around him as Larry's body shifted, sending ripples across the surface. He stepped back, his eyes avoiding the corpse as he grabbed the plastic bag containing Tiffany's dismembered remains.

The trip to the dumpster was a blur, his mind racing with every step. The alley was still, the shadows holding their breath as he moved through them. The dumpster was a maw of darkness, the perfect receptacle for his sins. With a grunt, he heaved the bag inside, the plastic crunching against the metal. The lid slammed shut, a finality that echoed through the alley.

He stepped back, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of his presence. The delivery man's footsteps echoed in his memory, a reminder that the world was waking up to a day that had irrevocably changed for him. The sun had fully risen now, casting the alley in a harsh, unforgiving light. He took a deep breath, the scent of garbage mingling with the coppery tang of blood.

The police would come, of that he had no doubt. But for now, he had bought himself a little more time. He turned and walked back into the house, the silence of his footsteps a stark contrast to the cacophony in his mind. The whiskey bottle called to him from the floor of his room, a seductive whisper promising to dull the pain.

But Marcus knew he couldn't give in, not now. He had to keep moving, had to stay sharp. He grabbed the phone and called in sick to work, his voice a shaky imitation of his usual gruffness. Then, he began to pack a bag, filling it with essentials: a change of clothes, his wallet, and the TV remote. He had to get out, had to put distance between himself and the bodies.

He took one last look around the room, the whiskey bottle glinting in the light, a silent specter of his past. He left it there, a symbol of his old life, and stepped into the hallway. The floorboards creaked, a mournful tune that seemed to follow him. He closed the door to his room, the sound of the lock clicking into place a mournful echo.

The house was still, the silence a cocoon around him. He moved quickly, gathering his things, the fear of discovery a constant companion. As he descended the stairs, the sunlight spilled in through the windows, painting the walls a warm gold. For a moment, he allowed himself to believe that he could leave it all behind, that he could start anew.

But as he stepped outside, the cold reality of his situation hit him like a slap in the face. The world had not stopped turning, the laughter of children playing in the street a mocking contrast to the darkness in his soul. He knew he couldn't outrun the truth, not forever. The bodies would be found, and the whispers would start. He was a killer now, a man with secrets that would never truly die.

He walked to the bus stop, the bag heavy on his shoulder. The TV remote dug into his side, a constant reminder of the lives he had taken. The bus pulled up, its engine purring with the promise of escape. Marcus climbed aboard, the diesel fumes mixing with the scent of his own fear. He took a seat in the back, his eyes on the world outside the window.

The city rolled by in a blur of concrete and steel, a testament to the lives lived and lost. The sun climbed higher in the sky, the heat of the day seeping into his bones. He knew he had to keep moving, had to find a place to hide, to think. But as the bus lurched forward, carrying him away from the scene of his crimes, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

He glanced around the bus, his eyes meeting the gazes of the other passengers. They were just faces in the crowd, but to him, they were judges and jurors, ready to condemn him at a moment's notice. His palms grew slick with sweat, and his breath came in shallow gasps. The whispers of his guilt grew louder, drowning out the murmur of the engine.

Marcus stepped off the bus at the next stop, his legs shaking with the effort of maintaining his composure. He wandered aimlessly, the buildings closing in around him like a maze with no exit. The heat was oppressive, the air thick with the scent of exhaust and despair. He needed a new plan, a way to disappear. The TV was a beacon of hope, a ticket to a new life, if he could just figure out how to use it.

He found a quiet alley, the shadows a comforting embrace. He sat on the ground, the TV remote clutched in his hand like a talisman. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, willing the panic to subside. The whispers grew fainter, and he could almost feel the beginnings of a plan forming in his mind.

He would sell the TV, get some cash, and leave town. He had a friend in the next state over, a man named Jerry who owed him a favor. He could lie low there, build a new life, away from the prying eyes of the police and the specter of his past. The thought brought a glimmer of hope, a spark in the abyss of his fear.

But first, he had to ditch the evidence, the bloody couch cushions and the plastic bag that held the grisly remains of his former neighbors. He found a dumpster, the stench of rotting food a welcome distraction from his own odor of death. He heaved the cushions in, the sound of them landing with a wet thud echoing in the alley. The bag with Tiffany followed, a final goodbye to the life he had destroyed.

Marcus stood for a moment, his eyes closed, listening to the fading sounds of the city. The sirens in the distance grew louder, a symphony of chaos that seemed to be closing in on him. He had to move quickly, had to vanish before the noose tightened.

With a newfound urgency, he hailed a taxi, the TV remote still clutched in his hand. He gave the driver an address, a random number on a street he had never been to before. The car pulled away from the curb, the engine a soothing lullaby as the city blurred into a kaleidoscope of colors.

In the taxi, the whispers grew faint, the guilt a distant memory. For now, he was free, a man on the run with the wind in his hair and the world at his fingertips. But he knew it wouldn't last. The shadows of his past would always follow him, a relentless pursuer that would never tire.

He had to be smarter, had to stay one step ahead. As the car sped through the streets, he began to formulate a new identity, a new life. He would become someone else, leave Marcus and his demons behind. The TV remote was his key to a fresh start, a gateway to a world of anonymity and escape.

The taxi pulled up to a pawnshop, the neon sign flickering in the early morning light. Marcus stepped out, the bag with the TV remote in his pocket. The bell jingled as he pushed open the door, the smell of stale cigarette smoke and dusty dreams enveloping him. He approached the counter, his heart racing, and laid the remote on the grimy glass.

The pawnbroker looked him over, his eyes shrewd and assessing. ""What's the story with this?"" he asked, his voice gravelly from years of hard living.

Marcus forced a smile, the lie coming easily to his lips. ""It's just a TV remote,"" he said, the words tasting like ash. ""It's not worth much, but I need the cash.""

The pawnbroker studied the remote, then nodded. ""Fifty bucks,"" he said, sliding the money across the counter.

Marcus took the cash, the feel of it in his hand a strange comfort amidst the chaos. He had to be smart now, had to play the part of the desperate man with nothing to hide. He pocketed the money and left the pawnshop, the bell chiming a tune of both liberation and finality. The cash burned a hole in his pocket, a siren song of escape beckoning him westward.

He bought a bus ticket at the station, choosing a route that would take him as far from the city as possible. The line to the counter was long, a serpentine of people with their own stories of despair and hope. He waited, his eyes darting from face to face, searching for any sign of recognition or suspicion. But all he saw were the weary expressions of those trapped in their own struggles, oblivious to the monster in their midst.

The bus ride was a blur of passing scenery and racing thoughts. He had to stay off the grid, find a place where no one would look for him. He had to become someone else, erase every trace of Marcus from existence. The whispers of his past grew fainter with each mile, replaced by the rumble of the engine and the hiss of tires on asphalt.

When the bus finally pulled into a small town, Marcus knew he had found his refuge. The streets were quiet, the buildings old and weathered. It was a place where the world had moved on, leaving behind a quiet dignity that whispered of forgotten secrets and second chances. He stepped off the bus, the warmth of the sun a stark contrast to the cold grip of fear that had held him for so long.

The local diner was a beacon of light, the scent of greasy food and strong coffee a balm to his frayed nerves. He took a seat at the counter, the vinyl stool sticking to his skin. The waitress, a middle-aged woman with a kind smile, brought him a cup of coffee without asking. Her eyes held a knowing look, as if she had seen men like him before, men running from their own shadows.

He took a sip, the liquid scalding his throat, grounding him in the present. For a moment, he allowed himself to feel the warmth of human connection, the comfort of anonymity. But as he glanced at the TV above the counter, the news flashed a story of a gruesome murder, the image of Larry and Tiffany's house plastered on the screen. The whispers grew louder, the noose tightening once more.

Marcus's hand trembled, the cup rattling against the saucer. The waitress's eyes flicked up to meet his, a question in her gaze. He forced a smile, the muscles in his cheeks aching with the effort. ""Just tired,"" he murmured, pushing the coffee away. He couldn't stay here, not now. The whispers had become a roar, a siren's call that would lead the authorities straight to him.

With a heavy heart, he stood up, the TV's chatter a cacophony of accusations. He had to keep moving, had to find a place where the whispers couldn't follow. He stepped out into the sun-drenched street, the TV's remote still in his pocket, a silent testament to the life he had left behind. The world waited for him, vast and unknowable, full of danger and potential.

He walked towards the horizon, the sun a blinding spot in the sky. His steps were unsteady, his breathing ragged. The town grew smaller in the distance, a mirage of a life he could never have. The whispers grew faint, the fear a dull throb in his chest. Marcus knew he couldn't outrun the truth forever, but for now, he had a head start.

The road ahead was long, the future uncertain. But as he disappeared into the horizon, the whispers of his past grew quieter, the promise of a new identity beckoning him onward. The TV remote was a reminder of the life he had stolen, but also a symbol of the power to rewrite his own story.

And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in shadows, Marcus took the first step into his new life, the echoes of his past fading with each stride. The quiet of the evening was a balm to his soul, the silence a promise of a life untainted by the cackling laughter of his demons. He had survived the night of blood and whispers, and now, he had to survive the aftermath.

He found a small, dilapidated motel on the outskirts of the next town. The neon sign flickered, the letters spelling out ""VACANCY"" in a seductive dance of light. Marcus approached the office, his heart hammering in his chest. The clerk, an old man with a world-weary gaze, barely looked up as he handed over the key. The room was a sanctuary, the worn-out bed and peeling wallpaper a stark contrast to the gleaming TV that dominated the space.

He turned it on, the static a comforting white noise that drowned out the whispers. The news played in the background, but he couldn't bring himself to watch it. Instead, he stared at the wall, his mind racing with the what-ifs and hows. How long could he keep this up? Would he ever find peace?

The knock on the door startled him, sending his heart into a frenzy. He approached it, his hand on the knob, his breath shallow. When he peeked through the peephole, he saw a young girl, her eyes wide with fear. She clutched a plastic bag, her knuckles white. ""Please,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""I need help.""

The whispers grew louder, a cacophony of doubt and suspicion. He knew he should turn her away, keep moving, stay hidden. But something in her eyes, a flicker of innocence lost, called to him. He opened the door, the chill of the evening air a slap to the face. ""What's wrong?"" he asked, his voice gruff, unused to kindness.

Her story spilled out, a tale of a world crueler than he could ever imagine. Her father had gone missing, leaving her alone with a mother who had turned to drugs and abuse. Marcus felt a twinge of pity, a spark of something he thought he had lost. He offered her a bed for the night, a sandwich, and the quiet refuge of his room.

As they sat on the bed, the TV playing a mindless sitcom, she talked of her dreams, her hopes, her fears. The whispers grew quieter, drowned out by the steady rhythm of her voice. And for a brief moment, Marcus allowed himself to feel something other than the cold grip of guilt. He saw in her a reflection of himself, a soul adrift in a sea of chaos.

When she finally fell asleep, her head on his shoulder, the TV still playing, Marcus sat in the darkness, the weight of his actions pressing down on him. He knew he couldn't save her, couldn't save anyone. But he could give her a night of peace, a small reprieve from the horrors that awaited her outside.

The whispers grew faint, the TV's glow a comforting presence in the gloom. He sat there, the remote in his hand, the power to change the channel a symbol of his dwindling control over his own fate. But as the night stretched on, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. He knew that soon, the past would catch up with him, the bodies would be found, and the hunt would begin anew.

With a heavy sigh, Marcus stood up, the girl's head rolling onto the pillow. He knew he had to go, had to leave before the whispers grew too loud to ignore. He gathered his things, the TV remote a silent witness to the brief connection he had allowed himself. He stepped out into the night, the motel's neon glow a beacon of the life he had left behind.

The stars above twinkled like a thousand accusatory eyes, but he ignored them, focusing on the road ahead. The whispers had become a constant companion, a reminder of the lives he had taken and the price he would pay. But for now, he had to keep moving, had to stay one step ahead of the inevitable.

The night was long, the miles stretching out before him like a black ribbon of uncertainty. The TV remote felt heavier with each step, a burden that weighed on his soul. But it was also a reminder of the power to choose, to rewrite his story. And so, he walked into the darkness, the whispers of his past a fading echo, the promise of a new dawn a beacon in the distance.",1,1737798505.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I'm not interested in any form of prostitution (🤮).

Hostels are good but no locals (apart from the friendly staff). 

If any kampot people want to share a tea just let me know.

1i9jkoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1i9jkoz/dirty_fasting/,Dirty fasting,"I read fast like a girl and I just started really fasting because I started my cycle. So the first day I did a 20 hr fast and today I tired fo do another 20 hr fast. I had such an issue with getting all my protein in. Before this I'd have instant coffee powder and instead of milk I'd use premier protein which is 30g protein, 160cals, 1g sugar and 5g of carbs. Or I'd use an Atkins strong shake which has 30g proteins, 190cals, 1g sugar and 1g carbs for my liquid. Could I do a ""dirty fast"" and drink my coffee protein shake during my fasted time? I understand this isn't a true ""pure"" fast but I'm worried about getting my protein in. My goal for fasting is weight loss, I do a lot of lifting at the gym and a day of cardio. Will I still be able to lose a significant amount of weight? I'm trying to make it a lifestyle but I also want to lose 35lbs by May. ",1,1737798141.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False
1i9jjlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1i9jjlz/well/,Well...,"Woke up this morning. Coffee. Smoke. The excitement of being on the boat soon, hit immediately. Like a kid with a five pound bag of jelly bellys. Breakfast was a delicious concoction of potatos, gravy, sausage, and cheese. All the compliments I've been sending to the women cooking paid off in a good helping with some extra cheese for good measure. More coffee. Another smoke.

The people running the shelter start getting people together on lists based on where their going. I get told I'll be on the last bus out. ""No problem."" I don't want to spend all day sitting at a bus station anyway. Bus is scheduled for 3:55pm.

I watch everybody slowly get taken away. The staff start breaking down cots. Blankets and pillows in bags. Snacks pulled out of pop-ups. Pop-ups broken down. Tables disassembled and stacked in another room. Floors vacuumed. Food out of the building. It hits about 2:00...

2:30. The place is a ghost town. Me and the other guy waiting on a ride to the bus station. A couple people tying up loose ends on the cleaning.

One of the busses comes back. Dude walks up to me. ""You ready to go?"" ""Give me thirty seconds to put this pack on and I will be."" ""Get your stuff together and go find a seat on the  bus."" Gear on. Out to bus. Find a seat that looks slightly farther away from the others. Perfect for a fully loaded backpack and a hitchhiker. Gear down. Me in seat. Bus driver comes back. Off to greyhound station.

'Sweet.Only an hour or so at the bus station. I've got a one hour layover in Atlanta. Almost two hours right at breakfast time in Jacksonville. I'll be on the pier by 2:45. Not bad.'

Get dropped at bus station. The other guy and I have been talking off and on all day. He's a little older, not in great health, but still holding his own. We drop our stuff outside the bus station. Have a smoke. He's out, so I bum him one. 'Running low. I'm not trying to run out of smokes with short cigarette breaks in random places.' ""I'm gonna run across the street and gets some smokes."" ""I'll be here."" We both laugh. Gear on. Across street. I trust the guy but he's in no shape to defend any of our collective stuff if somebody gets serious. And we all know rule number one... Right?!.

Into walmart gas station. 'Let's just see...' Kinda want a pack of Winston's. That's my smoke of choice. I've been smoking the cheapest smokes I can find since I left the boat. Left with none, and zero money. Bummed a few from my homebum friend and the guy who's watching my boat the night before. Things are going good. It's all starting to come together. I've got a few bucks. 

'Eight fifty? Yeah fuck that! When I get back near the boat they'll be four fifty.' ""A pack of Lucky Strikes please."" Somehow they're the cheapest here. Paid. Out the door with a polite thank you. Back across street. Bus station. Inside.

Find several seats me, dude, and our respective conglomerate of gear can fit in front of. Gear down. ""Hey!"" Me looking left, ""What!"" ""Come here!"" ""No!"" ""I'm trying to be nice."" I walk over. ""What."" I'm in grew up north of Los Angeles do not fuck with me mode. This bus station is in a shit part of town. Yes, I know. They're all in a shit part of town. I went into this one prepared to cut a motherfucker. The last thing I ever want someone telling me to do is come here. You can walk your ass over here if you got something to say. I always take it as a power play. Fuck that. I'm in control of me. Not you. 'He did say he was trying to be nice...'

Dude proceeds to give me the rundown on really cheap and easy to make heaters for my tent. I'm good. I'm probably not gonna light any fires in my tent. But I politely but seriously listen. ""Thanks man."" Back over to chairs sit down.

The wonderful women at the church loaded both of us up with brand new reusable bags full of random foods. We haven't eaten since breakfast. We start digging out the ready to eat food out of our respective bags. 'That's better.'

3:55 bus arrival time comes and goes. 5:00. 6:00. 'This a gonna be another greyhound adventure.' 6:20. The bus pulls in. We all line up in front of the door. Bus driver comes in. Nicely explains there's ice on the roads. That's why she's late. Bus gets serviced. Finally tickets are checked. Board bus. Finally get on the road at 6:40.

Bus stops in Montgomery. Smokers bail off quickly. Smokes. I apologize to dude with the tent heater rundown for being a dick to him at the bus station. We're good. Back on the bus. 

Some drunk girl starts talking shit to the guy behind me traveling with his dog. He's being as cool as he can be about it. She's being a C-word. Just can't shut her mouth about it. Getting shittier by the second. Bus driver gets involved. Deescalates the situation. Threatenes to throw the girl off. She shuts up for about ten seconds.  Starts running her mouth again. To the bus driver. ""I'll tell you what I'm gonna do."" Bus driver pulls out phone. Callls cops. Girl gets taken away in handcuffs. We hit the road.

I get a little sleep. Not much. Wake up. The first thing my eyes lock on is the girl across the isle's phone. She's on reddit. 'Great idea.' A bit of reddit. Finally I can't resist. I put my phone in her field of view. ""Wha.. Oh,  reddit."" A smile.

Finally make it to Atlanta. An hour and a half after my connecting bus has left. In line for ticket counter. Nice black woman behind desk. Me being my sweetest self. ""The next bus is tomorrow night at 12:20 am. Not too mamy busses run down there."" ""Well I guess I'll hang out and screw up your town for a while."" She laughs. ""It seems like I'll be here a while."" ""Yeah, like me leaving and coming back kinda while."" We laugh. What else can I do. ""Well, if you get bored at work tomorrow I'll take you out for coffee."" She laughs. Hands me my paperwork for the new bus. Twenty three hours from then.

So here I sit. In the Atlanta bus station at 4:26 in the morning. I did just find the fenced in smokers area. This is good. If I have to tell another group of dudes no to a cigarette I'm probably gonna be a lot less polite than I have been, which isn't very polite at this point. 

I've got the wifi password, some movies on this phone, a spot to charge on this chair. Not the worst situation. Definitely not the best. Now to find a place to stretch out and sleep.

Oh. And a wingnut two chairs to my left, who I've already told no to a cigarette, talking to himself and and wriggling around in his chair acting like his life is about to end now that I won't give hom a cigarette. It's amazing how normal he was before I told him no. Good times! 😆

Do you think they'll fuck with me if I pop this tent up in here?",2,1737797998.0,vagabond,3,1.0,False

1i9jik7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1i9jik7/learning_to_let_go_after_discard_ending_14_years/,learning to let go after discard ending 14 years of friendship,"Hi everyone, this is going to be a long post and I apologise in advance - but my 14 year relationship with a pwBPD ended last summer and while I’ve left the grief stage behind, my brain still seems incapable of letting go and thoughts of her haunt me every. fucking. day. (not to mention the almost nightly dreams of her showing back up in my life and my dream self, yay her, protecting her peace by telling her to eff off).  

Disclaimer: our relationship was a friendship, not a romantic relationship, but she was very much “my person”, just as I was her FP for a long time. She was the closest person to me for years and years on end and knew me better than anyone else, and since I suffered from low self-worth and pretty much failed to let anybody else in, the gap she’s left behind is huge.

That being said: whew, the shit I put up with. I’ve been lurking on here for some time trying to make sense of what happened to me and the more I read about and recognise the patterns of BPD behaviour, the more mind-blowing it all becomes. I guess I’m writing this because I’m non-stop fantasising about confronting her with my truth and, lacking the opportunity, I need a place to share what went down where people will understand. I don’t actually expect anyone to read this in full, but maybe someone will benefit from these insights one day, stuck in their own relationship with a pwBPD.

So yeah, this is my story.

I didn’t know she had BPD for a long time, and when she told me, about 4 years ago, she clearly expected me to get the hell out of dodge. I’d never heard of BPD before and while it certainly explained her intense emotional ups and downs and unpredictability, those were things I had come to associate with her and love about her as a friend. It was who she was, not something that needed a label, much less a stigma attached to it. I didn’t mind, even after doing my research. My friend was my friend, not some mental health monster out to destroy me.

Well.

I wonder now if this was the moment things started getting worse, because not too long after she owned up to her diagnosis, she also started weaponising it. I think she truly believed that once she opened up about having BPD (she was diagnosed when she was about 18, and told me when she was in her early 30s) instead of running from her shame and the stigma, something would change for the better. What she didn’t factor in was that it was her who would have to put the work in. 

She started therapist-hopping, always losing trust in them a few months down the road - this is a hard one to judge for me because it frequently did sound like they simply grew tired of her and failed to treat her properly. Then again, all I know is her side of the story, so maybe it was just her not wanting to hear the truth. Perhaps she was unlucky, perhaps it was a combination of both, or perhaps it was a self-fulfilling prophecy and a pwBPD BPD-ing hard.

Anyway. All throughout, I was her “fire safety blanket” - that’s one nickname she had for me, the other being “cold reason” (something she admired). It took me until browsing on here that I realised these are all just cutesy terms for the fact that I was her emotional regulator par excellence. 

Again, I didn’t mind - she was a little crazy, I was a lot calm, little could upset me because I lived life in survival mode and on high cortisol and I used to have this thing where, whenever something bad happened, I would go into a state of utter calm and just handle shit like a pro. And I have to be real: her extremes brought colour and charm into my life. When she was loving, she was the most loving I had ever known anybody in my life to be, far beyond anything I thought possible. I grew up in a household with zero emotional support, was touch starved and yearning to be allowed to feel anything, no matter how small, and then there was she - all emotion, all alive, constantly hugging me, telling me she loved me, and actually encouraging me to see what she saw in me: not the cold, heartless, emotionless egotist that my mother had made me believe I was, but a warm, loving, and gentle soul. 

She nurtured that, helped me grow into that, and for that, I will forever be grateful to her.

Unfortunately, circumstances in my life changed and I hit a low point that was a long, long time coming in late autumn 2022. I was heavily depressed, ended up on sick leave for five months, got put on meds and found a new therapist, who is brilliant and who I’m still with today. My pwBPD showed up for me at first, but overexerted herself due to her own lack of boundaries. What also happened and what I only realised very recently is that I lost my value as her emotional regulator. Suddenly it was me who needed emotional support, and who wasn’t able to provide it 24/7, and that’s when shit hit the fan.

She went through a really bad episode in December of that year, where she ended up rage-texting me “I wish I had your fucking boundaries” after I told her that no, I couldn’t come to her flat to take care of her because I was too unwell (or too depressed to move without phantom pains all over my body, let alone use public transport without an anxiety attack). She spent a few days recuperating from the attack, then came back saying she had really got the message this time and that it was time for her to put in work and change for the better. There were a couple of weeks over Christmas/New Years that we didn’t see each other, and once I was back in town, she invited me over.

That was one of the worst fucking days of my life. The hurt she caused me still feels as fresh today as it did then, and it was worse because it came with no prior warning. She told me she’d been ruminating for weeks over her feelings regarding her episode in December, trying to make sure they weren’t a spur-of-the-moment thing, but the outcome was the same: she said I had exploited her as a friend and she was really upset about being used like that. I tried to explain that I had never asked for a thing, and while my low self-worth immediately made me feel guilty for not having rejected her offers to visit me while I was knee-deep in my depression, I did pluck up the courage to tell her that - while I was unwell - I could not be expected to uphold her boundaries all the time. Her answer? “When have you ever?”

I swear, those words still follow me in my dreams. They felt like a visceral punch to the guts, and I immediately started bawling because man, was I hurt - and scared. Scared to lose the friendship, so much so that I ended up apologising and apologising, seeking faults in my own behaviour, and asking her what to do differently so she doesn’t feel that way. One of her suggestions? Say no at least twice when she offers me her favourite blanket, because she might need it more than me. 



Yeah. In hindsight, I know that that’s when I should have run. To add insult to injury, she ended the visit by thanking me that I didn’t yell at her for the things she said or call her a monster - meaning she knew that’s how those words should have been taken. Like I would have ever stood up to her, still in the throes of my depression and with zero self-esteem to allow for an alternative narrative in my head. I can’t help but feel that she knowingly pushed that weak spot in me and that a part of her was celebrating asserting her power over me, to dramatic effect.

Things picked up a little after that - I was bending over backwards to be a good friend, she started work with yet another new therapist and got some DBT workbooks to look at at home. Fast forward a few weeks and she’s going full throttle with the “I don’t actually have BPD, I’m fine” narrative. I was nearing the end of my sick leave, was anxious as fuck about returning to my godawful job, and when she told me that plus the fact that the DBT books were back in some cupboard, I freaked and left her a voice message that started act II in this Greek tragedy of a friendship. I told her I needed her to face her diagnosis and do as she promised little over a month ago, i.e. work on her DBT skills and put in the work to become more stable, or else I didn’t really know how to deal with this anymore. I was shit-scared of my recently-somewhat-stabilised-life falling to pieces again the moment I returned to work, and I just couldn’t cope with her spiralling into another episode in the foreseeable future or me having to instil reason into her and making her see-saw back to “I’m deranged (her word, not mine) and will take accountability”. Also, admittedly, I was frustrated because she is sort of a trust fund baby, doesn't need to work, has all the financial resources to seek help, and there she was wasting her time doing nothing when others would kill to have the opportunities she has.

Needless to say, that blew up badly - but it did so with a delay. She was shocked and upset by my behaviour right off the bat, of course, but we kind of talked it out via text and I ended up apologising for putting too much pressure on her (of course I did) and as I got Covid again briefly after that, she was too worried to spiral. Not so in the weeks after - her family has a holiday home in the US and she typically spends several weeks there in February and/or March. She disappeared, and by that, I mean literally - we went from texting multiple times every day to pretty much no contact. I worried, I wondered, I told myself she was simply having too good a time and that things would go back to normal once she returned. 

Well, I should have buckled up, because when she finally did come back, she suggested meeting for coffee (not giving any sign beforehand that something was wrong), then proceeded to more or less tear me apart - albeit in a cool, very detached and kind of cruel way. She said she’d split on me while in the US, then worked her way back to this, that what I demanded of her was downright inexcusable and that my behaviour was just like that of her narcissistic father - the main trauma-inducing person in her life and pretty much the whole reason she ended up with BPD. I had looked forward to finally spending time with my best friend again, and instead what I got was another punch to the gut. I ended up crying again like I did the first time, only in public. Did she blink an eye? No. I’m pretty sure she felt like I was getting my just deserts and that a part of her felt really fucking good about reducing me to a sobbing mess, questioning my worth as a friend and as a human being. I told her that no, I do not take joy in being as critical as my mother, and she made it seem like she was surprised - like that truly was new information to her. Her, who had taught me in the first place that I was a soft, caring being. Suddenly I was the enemy, a cold bitch that hurt her without any regard for her feelings.

Again, I ended up shouldering all the blame. I vowed to be better, she vowed to “call me out on my shit”. I made myself small. She said something had changed, that she would need time, and that she was going to cut down texting and talking to me to a minimum while she worked through this. It caused me a shitload of extra hurt, but I agreed because I didn’t see another choice - if those were her needs, those were her needs, and my own clearly didn’t carry the same weight since I was the “bad friend”.

Her birthday was a few weeks later. I think it was the next time we met in person, after going limited contact, and it just so turned out that all her other friends cancelled on her birthday dinner and I was the only one who made it. Within the span of an hour, she had insulted and belittled me three times, including saying that she felt “insulted only I had shown up to celebrate her”. As someone with low self-esteem who (and she knew this better than anyone) always felt like people were making a sacrifice if they spent time with me and that I wasn’t worth anyone's efforts, this felt like yet another sucker punch. 

I had also started dating someone a few weeks prior - something I had never felt good enough for before -, and she ridiculed my feelings before asking why I talked about him in such a stilted, distant way. I told her I didn’t feel safe opening up to her about this topic as she had already ridiculed me once, and lo and behold, she almost had an episode right then and there - somehow taking offence at the fact that she had hurt me, and that I dared tell her to her face. It was a strange evening.

To sum up the next few months - she ended up travelling again, cutting down contact again, pretty much making me chase after breadcrumbs for weeks on end. The guy I dated ended up being a somewhat toxic man child and triggered me really badly during one date, which was when - in my need for my person while in distress - I ended up reaching out to her for support. She somehow managed to twist my message into something to take offence at and refused to talk further, then said she would be in touch once she was back in town. That was, to my knowledge, at least a couple of weeks away, but since she has a habit of changing her return flight dates, it could have easily turned into a month. 



I’ll say this: I suffered. I honestly didn’t get what prompted this kind of behaviour towards me, how she could have just lost all love for me, and what entitled her to dictate when I was allowed and not allowed to talk to her. It was so disrespectful. It was so deliberately hurtful. It made me feel like I was no longer worth a penny in her eyes. I talked about it with friends, I talked about it with my therapist, and everyone told me to stop dealing with this abuse, but I was too deeply trauma bonded to even consider abandoning her, abandoning us. It felt like walking away would prove her right, that I was the bad friend, the one not willing to fight and work on the relationship. 

So I stayed, and I waited for her to grant me an audience. I was angry, too, and I walked into that meeting with a whole list of notes about all the ways she’d hurt me over the previous months, determined to find out what had caused that shift. She walked in with the same, and essentially, the conversation turned into an endless loop of “I did x because you did z”, on both sides. She did take some accountability, and did admit that some of the things she had done were hurtful - but. There was always a but, and she was close to lashing out again when I mentioned talking about her behaviour with my friends and my therapist, and how one friend had actually commented that she was treating me like I was some abusive partner that had to be held at arm’s length. She kept circling back to the point where I was supposed to take accountability, to admit all the things I had done to hurt her, stating that I had changed, I was the one who was no longer making sense, I was listening to people that were trying to paint her as the devil. I had put her on the spot, I had set her an ultimatum, no, she wasn’t punishing me for it, she was trying to make peace with it, it just didn’t involve me. And she most certainly had not dictated when I might and might not talk to her, that had never been her intention. When I told her all of my friends had read that message the very same way I did, she responded by saying that none of her friends did, and we were at an impasse. 

You can probably guess the result: I ended up conceding that my communication style is just different to hers, that I didn’t emphasise enough with her emotional states, that I lacked insight into what it meant to be living with BPD. She got her victim role back and we parted once again according to her wishes: reduced contact, more time to process things. Not as a punishment, or so she said, but just for her to work her way back to a place where she feels safe around me.



Well. Weeks passed without me hearing anything from her, until I cracked at some point and sent her a voice message, once again in tears, saying I can’t do this anymore, I miss her like fucking crazy and I want my best friend back and this no contact thing was too harsh. She acted surprised again, saying she didn’t realise this was so hard on me, and agreed to meet up. We had an okay chat catching up on our respective lives, and things kind of went back to a wobbly new normal - less contact than before, but we revived our mutual writing project, texted somewhat regularly, and I even ended up getting to spend my birthday in November at the lake house she was living at at the time. It could have felt like the old times, except she decided to bring up the conflict once again - blindsiding me completely (a running theme at this point) by stating that she felt like I was still putting the majority of the responsibility on her and more or less insinuating I hadn’t done enough penance/switched my narrative to fit hers better. I’m getting tired of saying this, but I started crying in front of her, wondering what it would take for me to be back in her good graces and to be considered a friend again, and she, once again, watched me without backing down. 

In hindsight, that strikes me as one of the most fucked up elements in all of this - the way every time she was reduced to a sobbing, child-like state in front of me because her emotions got the better of her, I reassured her, held her, talked her down, showed her kindness, yet when she was confronted with the very real pain her behaviour caused me, it didn’t seem to stir a thing in her. Maybe she got some kind of satisfaction out of it, I don’t know. I believed one of her breakdowns actually happened that same weekend, where she spiralled after I said something to the effect of having stood up to my parents as a teen, which she took as blame she didn’t manage to do the same and which led to me holding her as she cried like a child, recounting how terrified she was of her father.

That was the last time we actually spent any real time together. She had moved to the lake house permanently by then, saying she wanted to focus on her art and on herself (again, she never worked a real job a day in her life and changes her minds every couple of months on whether she wants to be a painter, a writer or a singer). Unlike the year prior, I wasn’t invited to spend New Years with her, and I believe she was upset with me for deciding to book a solo trip to Vietnam rather than to wait and see if she would ask me to be her personal assistant on a “research trip” to the States - which would have assigned me to the role of driver and would have involved waiting hours in the middle of nowhere while she worked on a painting. Bummer I had better ideas on what to do with my little time off work…

Our communication dwindled back down to a minimum, not due to a lack of trying on my part. She said she was depressed, working through things, working on her novel, no longer wanted to spend time on her phone and especially not texting, and since I dislike phone calls, there was nothing she could do. I decided to be the good friend and wait until she was feeling better, not wanting to pressure her into anything she felt uncomfortable with. She spent a month in the States with another friend, who she ended up splitting on towards the end, then invited her oldest childhood friend to spend time at the lake house with her - not trying in any way to see me after her extended trip, nor extending any invitations to me. Eventually she did make plans to meet with me, but cancelled repeatedly and last minute and in the end, she went off to her workshop without us having spent time together again.

We’ve now reached June ’24, and she discarded me in August. Throughout the workshop, I tried reaching out to her, was excited for her, wanted to know what was going on, but it was like chasing after a ghost. She didn’t want to share a thing, replied in mono-syllables and kept repeating that she couldn’t find it in her to communicate via phone at the time. Again, I gave in. Again, I thought to myself that if only I pass this next test, if I prove my worthiness to her by doing exactly as she asks, things are bound to get better. It’s hard to believe I acted like this looking back, but my love for her was a fierce and a loyal thing, and I was hanging on to good times I hadn’t experienced in years.

She didn’t even let me know what day she’d return here, I just received a text several weeks later saying the plane had landed safely. Back she was at the lake house, spending time with everyone from her friend circle but me, and eventually, I found myself obsessing over the pain she was causing me to such a degree that I left her a message - walking on eggshells throughout - stating that I felt absolutely miserable about being discarded like this, that I had no idea what was going on, and that I needed her to explain, please. We had been meant to meet up that week, but she had cancelled, again, and waiting for her to finally throw me a breadcrumb was getting to be emotional torture.

What I received was a lengthy e-mail (!) that, once I read it to my therapist, prompted her to say “this is psychotic”. A few of my friends read it and two of them said they ended up feeling nauseous. It was a good-bye email that didn’t exactly spell it out and which forced me to ask her whether she actually meant to end the friendship or not, to which she said yes. She explained how she had reached a point in her self-development journey where she no longer wanted to be in any close relationship, and that she could no longer deal with our friendship because being around me forces her to focus on me, and she no longer wants to do this. (Read: After years and years of me regulating her BPD emotions for her, she no longer wants to make space for my normal-sized ones.) She said I had different communication needs (read: I would like to talk to my friends, not spend months getting the silent treatment), as well as a different understanding of boundaries, and that she doesn’t see a way forward where one of us “doesn’t suffer from the compromises necessary”. “She doesn’t feel herself when she’s around me”, which is a lovely thing to hear after being told for years that she loves me like crazy, that I’m the best, that we were meant to be friends forever, and that she loves me so much it hurts. Oh, and, one of my favourites: She tried so hard to make it work. Yeah, by going it alone and cutting me out of her life for months on end. 

My world fell apart that day. It was heartbreak on a level I had never experienced before, and I was stupid enough in that first wave of grief to tell her she’s welcome to reach out anytime she feels safer in herself, that I loved her and that I would miss her. I truly wish I’d never said that to her, but if she ever does come back - and I don’t actually think she will, trapped as she is in her grand self-delusions - I will shut that door right in her face and tell her to get lost.

The betrayal is out of this world, as is the pain, the grief, the confusion, the disbelief, the anger. Oh, the anger. There is so much injustice in all of this, so much unfairness, and it eats away at me every damn day. I deserved so much better, and it makes me furious that she gets to live on in her fantasy world, thinking she was the bigger woman by stepping away like this, wrapping yet another victim cocoon around herself. She even had the gall to tell me that I shouldn’t be alarmed when she deletes me on all her apps, but seeing my name is just going to be too painful for her. For her? Burn in hell.

I’m still hoping she will regret this one day. I’m still hoping for justice I’ll never find or get. I hope she’s miserable just so I’m not the only one bearing the miserable burden of this heartache. I’m at an age where I don’t think I’ll find another friend I’ll ever be this close too, and it hurts knowing I gave it all to her, who started walking away the moment I lost my usefulness. A part of me also fears that no one will ever love me the way she did, although I guess only time will tell. 

Anyway, I wish she would just get out of my head - that I could let the injustice go. Fingers crossed that typing this all out will do something to my brain.",1,1737797862.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

I f*CK up and need to repair my laptop 7 asap after my coffee cup leaked in my computer bag and a little bit in my laptop. Now the battery won't charge (stays at 0% when plugged in) but the laptop boots when plugged in. I dissembled the whole laptop to check for damages and further leak and had to remove the protective shields. I thought I could easily find more shields, but it seems almost impossible to find. Even after contacting authorized repair shop, they don't sell this parts individually. Any help would be welcome.

Also, just ordered a new battery and now I'm looking for the Torx+ screwdriver bits and some extra screws (IP2 to 6). If anyone can help me find some I would be very grateful.
Also, should I keep using it plugged in even if the battery won't work or should I stop and wait for the replacement battery? 
I also did a diagnostic and everything works perfectly.
So like I said previously, I seriously f*CK up and need some help.

In today’s fast-paced digital world, marketing is no longer just about algorithms and tools; it’s about crafting stories that captivate and resonate with people. Think about it — when was the last time a perfectly targeted ad or a beautifully crafted email made you feel understood? That’s the magic of modern digital marketing. At its core, it’s about building connections, one story at a time.  
Picture this: a small coffee shop struggling to attract customers until they share a heartfelt video of their barista’s journey. Or a budding e-commerce brand that skyrockets its sales by telling the story behind their handcrafted products through an engaging blog. These aren’t just strategies — they’re stories that transform businesses.  
Let’s embark on a journey through the 8 pillars of digital marketing, exploring how each one isn’t just a tactic but a tool to create meaningful connections in the ever-evolving digital landscape.

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Imagine you’ve opened a cozy bookstore in a bustling neighborhood. But without a clear sign board or directions, how will people find you? SEO is your digital signpost, guiding people to your website.  
Key Tactics: Conduct keyword research, create high-quality content, and ensure a mobile-friendly website.  
Why It Matters: SEO enhances your website’s credibility, increases brand visibility, and generates sustainable traffic.  
Think of SEO as the friend who introduces you to the right crowd at the right time. It’s all about showing up when it matters most. For example, businesses that rank on the first page of search engines enjoy 75% of all clicks. Imagine being the go-to bookstore everyone finds first — SEO makes that happen. Plus, optimizing for local search ensures your store is the first choice for nearby customers.  
If you’re looking to take your SEO game to the next level, you can reach out to professional [**search engine optimization services in Delhi**](https://ksixinternational.in/service-page/) for customized solutions tailored to your needs. To build strong SEO, patience and consistency are key. It’s not an overnight success story, but a rewarding journey that builds long-term trust with your audience.

# Content Marketing

Content marketing is like being the host of an unforgettable dinner party. You provide the food (valuable content), great conversation (engagement), and a memorable experience (trust-building).  
Key Formats: How-to guides, case studies, whitepapers, and tutorials.  
Why It Matters: Great content builds trust, establishes your authority in the industry, and drives conversions over time.  
Every piece of content is a story waiting to be told, designed to make your audience feel heard and valued. For instance, imagine publishing a blog that answers your customer’s burning question or creating a tutorial video that solves a problem they’ve struggled with for months. This level of care doesn’t just attract clicks — it earns loyalty.  
HubSpot found that businesses that prioritize blogging see 13x more ROI. That’s the power of content marketing: creating a library of resources that customers can rely on, no matter where they are in their journey. To make your content marketing more effective, **content marketing services in Delhi** can help craft strategies that resonate with your audience while driving business results.

# Social Media Marketing

Picture a bustling marketplace where every stall is fighting for attention. Social media marketing is your stage, where you can showcase your brand’s personality and spark conversations.  
Popular Platforms: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok.  
Why It Matters: Social media fosters community engagement, humanizes your brand, and amplifies your reach.  
Whether it’s an Instagram Reel that goes viral or a heartfelt LinkedIn post, social media is your chance to connect directly with your audience. Take Wendy’s Twitter strategy as an example — their witty, engaging responses have turned them into a social media icon.  
Engagement isn’t just about likes and shares; it’s about building a dialogue. A thoughtful reply to a comment or a behind-the-scenes post can make your audience feel like they’re part of your journey. Consistency is key — your audience wants to hear from you regularly, and each post is an opportunity to deepen that relationship. To boost your reach and engagement, consider hiring **Social Media Marketing Services in Delhi** for a personalized approach to social media success.

# Pay-Per-Click Advertising (PPC)

Think of PPC as a digital fast lane. Imagine you’re launching a new product, and you want instant visibility. PPC helps you cut through the noise and get noticed right away.  
Key Benefits: Precise targeting, measurable ROI, and budget control.  
Why It Matters: PPC drives traffic quickly, making it perfect for time-sensitive campaigns or product launches.  
With PPC, you’re paying for prime real estate on the digital highway, ensuring your message reaches the right audience. For example, Google Ads allows you to target customers based on their search intent, meaning you’re connecting with people who are already looking for what you offer.  
Unlike organic strategies, PPC delivers immediate results. It’s like turning on a tap — you control the flow and only pay for the water you use. This makes it ideal for seasonal promotions or product rollouts. If you’re looking to maximize your advertising efforts, consider **PPC management services in Delhi** for professional campaign management.

# Affiliate and Influencer Marketing

Imagine your favorite YouTuber recommending a product they genuinely love. That’s the magic of influencer and affiliate marketing — authentic endorsements that build trust.  
Key Examples: Collaborating with bloggers, YouTubers, and social media influencers.  
Why It Matters: These strategies expand your reach and provide authentic endorsements.  
It’s like word-of-mouth on steroids, fueled by personalities your audience already admires. Studies show that 92% of consumers trust recommendations from individuals over brands. For instance, a beauty influencer sharing their favorite skincare routine can generate more trust than a traditional ad.  
Authenticity is the secret ingredient here. When influencers align with your brand values, their endorsements feel genuine and relatable, amplifying your credibility.

# Email Marketing

Email marketing is the art of crafting the perfect love letter to your audience. It’s personal, thoughtful, and always arrives at the right moment.  
Key Strategies: Personalization, segmentation, and automated drip campaigns.  
Why It Matters: Email marketing drives conversions with a high return on investment (ROI).  
When done right, emails don’t just sell — they build relationships that last. For example, a welcome email series can make new subscribers feel valued, while a cart abandonment email can gently nudge them to complete their purchase.  
According to Campaign Monitor, for every $1 spent on email marketing, the average ROI is $36. This makes it one of the most cost-effective strategies to nurture leads and keep customers engaged. If you need help crafting the perfect email strategy, working with an **email marketing service provider in Delhi** can help elevate your campaigns and drive results.

# Mobile Marketing

Picture yourself receiving a timely SMS about a discount at your favorite store just as you’re walking by. That’s the power of mobile marketing — it’s personal and immediate.  
Key Features: Location-based services, push notifications, and responsive design.  
Why It Matters: Mobile marketing captures attention where people spend most of their time — on their phones.  
Mobile marketing is the perfect blend of convenience and relevance. Apps like Starbucks use location-based push notifications to alert customers of nearby stores and exclusive deals. This level of personalization keeps customers engaged and coming back.  
As smartphone usage continues to rise, optimizing for mobile isn’t just an option — it’s a necessity. A responsive design ensures that your emails, websites, and ads look great on any device. If you’re looking to take your mobile marketing efforts further, a **custom website development in Delhi** service can help you create responsive, mobile-friendly platforms.

# Video Marketing

Imagine a gripping movie trailer that leaves you wanting more. That’s the essence of video marketing — it captivates, engages, and inspires action.  
Key Platforms: YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok.  
Why It Matters: Video marketing is engaging, shareable, and helps explain complex topics in an easy-to-digest format.  
From tutorials to testimonials, video marketing lets you tell your story in the most compelling way. Consider the success of brands like Nike, whose storytelling through video ads inspires millions worldwide. According to Wyzowl, 84% of people say they’ve been convinced to buy a product or service by watching a brand’s video.  
The secret to great video marketing lies in authenticity. Whether it’s a live Q&A or a behind-the-scenes look, videos create an emotional connection that words alone can’t achieve.

# Conclusion

The digital marketing landscape is vast and ever-evolving, offering countless ways to connect with your audience. From foundational strategies like SEO and content marketing to the dynamic worlds of video and influencer marketing, each pillar is a unique gateway to creating impactful connections. These tools are not merely mechanisms — they’re the backbone of stories that shape relationships and build trust.  
At the heart of every successful strategy lies a story waiting to be told. The most impactful digital marketers are the ones who can weave these stories seamlessly into their campaigns, aligning their brand’s values with the emotions and aspirations of their audience. Success is not just about clicks or conversions — it’s about forging lasting bonds. What story will your brand share today? Take the leap, because every journey begins with a single step, and every click could be the start of something extraordinary.

***Private Memory Transcript, Earth-Date:*** 07-03-2141

**Jovi Rosee, Head of Production of Rosee Studios, Employee of MultiVer Solutions, Head Writer and Executive Director of “The Exterminators (2141)”**

*Six days, four hours until incident*

The train from Hartsfield-Jackson was always my favorite part about coming home in my college days. The ride, taking us into Five Points, the heart of the city, seemed like it was positioned to see as little of the city as possible, but that didn't fool me. Atlanta—The ATL, Silicon Peach, The City in a Forest, whatever you called it—I was here, and I felt... home.

Although home was a half hour drive away, Atlanta still felt like it was where I belonged. When I was a kid, going into Atlanta wasn't that big of a deal: a day trip, sure, but almost never a full-on vacation. Ever since I went to college in what was then Spain, however, Atlanta was far enough away to basically be on another planet.

…which made being evacuated to Skalga, a literal other planet, feel even more isolating.

Danny, who was sitting next to me, gave me a little nudge that pulled me from my thoughts. “Did you hear about MultiVer’s latest ‘big idea’?”

Max finally glanced up from her holopad, curious. “What now?”

Danny leaned forward, lowering his voice a little, though there was no real reason to whisper. “MultiVer Interstellar Solutions—you know, the new space transit arm they’re building out? They’re starting to sell tickets for civilian voyages to Skalga and Leirn.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Already? I thought they were still testing prototypes for that.”

“Nah, it’s happening,” Danny replied, grinning like he was in on a secret. “Ideally, they want to make space travel as common as hopping on a plane or train. Skalga’s the big ticket item, obviously— thanks to the Exchange program and the refugee population on Skalga, a lot of people *love* the idea of visiting the Venlil homeworld, even with the mask restrictions. And Leirn? I think they’re trying to position as the ultimate ‘cultural getaway.’ You know, surfing with aliens, 'historic' cities, rustic charm. Really leaning into the exotic vibe.”

Max snorted again, shaking her head. “They’re trying to turn interplanetary travel into a vacation package. Classic MultiVer.”

“Hey, if it works, it works,” Danny shot back. “And they’re pricing the tickets surprisingly low—well, for space travel. The first runs are already getting waitlisted.”

The thought of it was… surreal. I glanced out the window as the train hummed along, passing through pockets of greenery and glimpses of the Atlanta skyline. I’d grown up dreaming of seeing the world. Now people were dreaming of *Skalga* and *Leirn*.

“My brother told me the neighborhood he and the family were placed in was called ‘Little Terminus’ now,” I said, thinking of my family a thirty minute drive to the south of us. It sounded, and if the photos are accurate, looked like a strange sort of nostalgia—Atlantans of all different stripes creating a city that could only exist on Skalga. “Murals of the skyline and fried pies baked in strayu ovens…” I trailed off, smiling at the thought. “If we go to Skalga someday, I’d definitely visit the place.”

“Little Terminus?” Max repeated with a smirk. “That’s kind of cute.”

“Sure sounds like it,” I agreed, then turned to Max with a mischievous grin. “Hey, what kind of strings do you think we’d have to pull to arrange a convention tour on Skalga?”

Max rolled her eyes, pretending to be exasperated. “Depends. Are we going for tourism or publicity?”

“Both,” I replied quickly, leaning back in my seat. “There’s a market for human media just about anywhere in the Sapient Coalition, and there’s a significant human presence on Skalga. Doesn’t seem fair that we’re only focusing on Earth when we’ve got an audience across several planets.”

Danny nodded thoughtfully, tapping his fingers on his knee. “You’re not wrong. The numbers from Skalga alone are solid. I bet we could get a turnout for a fan event. We’d just have to work with the UN on visas. And MultiVer would probably jump at the chance to cross-promote their new interstellar lines.”

Max groaned. “We’re not turning *The Exterminators* into an interstellar tourism ad, Danny.”

“Why not?” Danny said, throwing up his hands with a laugh. “Think of the posters! ‘The galaxy at your fingertips, with MultiVer Interstellar Solutions!’”

I couldn’t help but laugh at the image. It was a little ridiculous, sure, but in a weird way, it wasn’t *impossible*. The train began to slow as we approached the station, the skyline growing larger in the window. It was a reminder of just how far everything had come—Atlanta, Earth, humanity as a whole. We weren’t confined to just this city or even this planet anymore.

Max sighed dramatically. “If you two start pitching this to MultiVer, I’m not coming. I’ll send a hologram or something.”

“No holograms,” I shot back, grinning. “If we’re going to Skalga, we’re bringing the whole team.”

The train slid to a smooth stop, the automated announcer welcoming us to Five Points Station. As we gathered our things, Danny muttered, half-jokingly, “Well, if we get a convention on Skalga, I’m putting in a request for Leirn next. I hear Yotul cuisine is fabulously spicy.”

Max snorted one last time as we stepped onto the platform. “Always thinking ahead, aren’t you, Danny?”

Danny grinned. “Somebody’s gotta.”

 

We filed off the train and into the station, the air thick with the familiar smells of fast food and transit grime. I took a deep breath, letting the city seep into my senses. This was Atlanta—a messy, buzzing, unapologetically alive place. And for the next few hours, it was the center of my universe.

The MultiVer Peachtree Plaza was a massive building, one of the tallest in Atlanta, and for years, the tallest building in any U.S. state capital. While MultiVer hadn’t been the ones to originally build it—its towering glass-and-steel structure had been an iconic part of Atlanta’s skyline since the late 20th century—they had certainly found a home in it. MultiVer had taken what was once a sleek but aging skyscraper and turned it into the beating heart of their global operations. The company had spared no expense modernizing the space: its facade shimmered with sleek holographic displays with ever-shifting art showcasing MultiVer’s reach across not just the world, but now *worlds*.

Stepping through the rotating glass doors into the lobby felt like entering another reality altogether. The space was *alive*—a hive of movement and sound that felt at once chaotic and meticulously curated. A polished marble floor stretched out before us, reflecting the glow of towering LED screens and virtual displays that floated in the air. Panels of light pulsed with soft, ambient colors—peach tones and warm golds—that gave the space an inviting but distinctly futuristic feel.

Max looked around as we took it in, and I heard her mutter under her breath, “Plentygreen City feels kind of small now.”

She wasn’t wrong. It was easy to forget that MultiVer wasn’t just a media company. Sure, they made movies, television shows, video games, and all other manner of media. But they were also a giant in other places. Their fingers were in everything— pharmaceuticals, clothing, electronics, foodstuffs, advanced communications tech that had helped unify fractured planetary networks, and even some military equipment that had seen action with the UN.

Standing here in the MultiVer Plaza, it was clear that they wanted to *show* that reach. They wanted you to know that they weren’t just a business.

They were *the* business.

Danny, who had been here on the regular before back when he worked in MultiVer’s legal department, looked bored as he scrolled through his holopad, though he muttered a quick “Welcome to Ground Zero of all things MultiVer,” as we walked further into the lobby.

But Flurin and Max—this being their first time at MultiVer’s global headquarters—were visibly taken aback. Their surprise wasn’t just from the grandeur of the place, though I could see Flurin’s eyebrows climbing toward his— Hairline? Quill-line? —as he scanned the massive crystal chandelier that hung like a web of light above us.

“Are there always *this* many non-humans here?” Flurin asked, his tone somewhere between curious and impressed.

I followed his gaze, and I had to admit, it was striking. While humans were still the majority in the lobby, there was a notable mix of aliens walking through the space. The familiar species were easy to pick out: Venlil with their soft, woolly fur, some with horn headbands and some without, Gojid with their spiked backs, and Yotul, walking with the confidence they had ferociously earned. But there were others I didn’t expect to see working for humans: Krakotl, notably, but also Tilfish, Mazic, and I’m pretty sure there was a tour being given to a group of Dossur.

It wasn’t just the variety—it was the energy. Species of all kinds were chatting, exchanging papers and datapads, laughing together, and moving with purpose. It felt… seamless. Natural. Like this building wasn’t just a corporate headquarters but a hub for something much bigger.

“Guess they’ve put the *multi* in MultiVer, huh?” Danny said, breaking the silence. His tone was light, but his eyes were scanning the crowd like he was cataloging every detail.

Max gave a low whistle. “I mean, I knew they were big on integration, but this is next-level. Do you think they’ve got a Xeno Resources department, or is it just one big melting pot?”

Flurin’s brow furrowed, his voice low and thoughtful. “There’s got to be specialized departments. Some of these species have completely different environmental needs—temperature, air composition… Even some dietary accommodations would be a nightmare to manage universally.”

I nodded, still watching the scene. “Whatever they’re doing, it’s working. And it’s a hell of a statement.”

Max smirked, gesturing toward a nearby group of Venlil employees chatting animatedly with a pair of humans. “Bet this is a marketing team. Probably brainstorming how to pitch to Skalga next quarter.”

Flurin elbowed her. “Not everything is about marketing, Max.”

“Tell that to the giant MultiVer logo on the front of this building,” she shot back, grinning.

 

Before the back-and-forth could continue, a voice cut through the bustling noise of the lobby. “Ah, there’s my team!”

I turned to see Jesse Multin approaching, his blue sharp suit impeccably tailored, his orange tie masterfully tied, and his wide grin as disarming as ever. His fast, confident strides carried him across the room like he owned the place—and he more or less did. He was the CEO and Co-President of MultiVer, after all (Mr. Oliver, who based himself in the Multaverde office, being the other).

“Welcome to MultiVer Plaza!” Jesse said, arms outstretched as if presenting the entire building to us. “Hope the train ride was smooth. And hey, glad you all got a chance to see the *real* MultiVer on your way in. First impressions matter, and this lobby? It’s a showstopper, isn’t it?”

“Definitely makes a statement,” I replied, shaking his hand.

“Good, good,” Jesse remarked, beaming. His gaze flicked to Flurin and Max, as he shook each of their hands. “First time here, huh? What do you think? Honest impressions only—don’t hold back.”

Max raised an eyebrow. “It’s… impressive. Feels like a miniature Sapient Coalition in here.”

Flurin was literally and metaphorically shaken by Mr. Multin’s vigorous handshake. Once he was no longer being shaken like a pecan tree, he nodded. “I wasn’t expecting this level of integration. It’s… ambitious. You must be very proud of what you’ve done, Mr. Multin.”

Jesse’s grin widened. “Indeed I am! Ambition is what drives us, my friend. Oh, and, Mr. Multin was my father— Well, before he became His Majesty King Ignacio the Third. Call me Jesse! Now, come on—our conference room’s waiting, and I’ve got some numbers to show you that’ll blow your socks off.”

He turned on his heel, gesturing for us to follow. As we made our way to the elevators, Danny leaned in close, muttering under his breath. “Anybody else feel like they just walked onto a set? Or is that just me?”

I chuckled softly, shaking my head. “Get used to it. This is Jesse James Multin we’re talking about. Everything’s a performance.”

And just like that, we were off to the meeting that, knowing Jesse, would probably feel more like a whirlwind than a business discussion.

 

**\[Fast-Forwarding Transcript: Five Minutes\]**

 

The conference room Jesse led us to was as sleek and polished as the lobby, with floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing a stunning view of downtown Atlanta. The table was long enough to seat at least twenty, but only five chairs were arranged near the head. A holographic screen was already displaying MultinPlex analytics in vibrant colors, the numbers scrolling and shifting in real-time.

Jesse slid into the seat at the head of the table and gestured for us to take the others. ""Alright, team,"" he began, clapping his hands together. ""Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let me just say one thing: Bravo. Absolutely brilliant work.""

I glanced at Danny, Max, and Flurin, all of whom looked just as puzzled as I felt. ""Thanks,"" I said hesitantly. ""But what specifically are we talking about?""

Jesse leaned back, a knowing smirk on his face. ""Come on, don’t be modest. The leak. That scene—the one where Erithe fights off the insurgents in her mecha? Pure adrenaline. It’s exactly what we needed to get people talking about *The Exterminators.*""

Flurin frowned, his brow furrowing. ""It wasn’t supposed to be available until the premiere last Sunday.""

""Exactly!"" Jesse said, pointing at him like he’d just solved a riddle. ""Which is why it was so brilliant to release it ‘accidentally.’ People love a good leak. Makes them feel like they’re in on a secret. And the best part? It had no real context—*just* enough action to hook viewers without giving away the story. Whoever orchestrated that, my hat’s off to you.""

I opened my mouth to explain that none of us had anything to do with it, but Jesse barreled ahead, not giving me the chance.

 

""Take a look at these numbers,"" he continued, gesturing to the holographic screen. ""MultinPlex viewership has skyrocketed. The premiere? Highest simultaneous viewing we’ve ever had since we started extraterrestrial service. And the chatter on Bleat and other platforms? Through the roof. Hashtags trending, fan theories galore—it’s a goldmine."" He was right. The graphs on the screen showed a massive spike in viewership and social media traffic in the days after the leak.

Danny shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his eyes darting to the screen and then to Jesse. ""So, you’re saying... you’re happy the scene leaked?""

""Happy?"" Jesse laughed, leaning forward. ""Mr. Foxton, I’m nothing short of ecstatic. This was marketing genius. And, if I may say, quite a calculated risk. It’s not every day a team has the guts to leak their own material, knowing it could backfire. But you pulled it off. I mean, come on, which one of you masterminds came up with it?""

There was a long pause as Jesse’s eyes flicked from me to Max to Danny and finally to Flurin.

""None of us did,"" I said finally, my voice steady. ""The leak wasn’t planned. We’ve just been trying to make the best of it.""

Jesse arched an eyebrow, his smirk growing. ""Oh, really?"" he said, drawing out the words. ""Interesting. Because it seems to me like someone on this team knew *exactly* what they were doing. I mean, look at that scene—action-packed, no spoilers, just enough to get people hyped. That doesn’t happen by accident.""

I felt a flicker of doubt but shook it off. Jesse was always like this—pushing, testing, looking for cracks in the façade.

""Well, whoever it was,"" Jesse said, leaning back with a satisfied sigh, ""you’ve got my gratitude. And my respect. This show is on track to become MultinPlex’s galactic flagship, and it’s all thanks to this team.""

Max exchanged a look with Flurin, who remained impassive. Danny, meanwhile, seemed to be sinking lower into his chair.

Jesse clapped his hands again, snapping us back to attention. ""Alright, that’s enough praise for now. Let’s talk next steps. But first..."" He turned to me, his expression shifting to something more serious. ""Jovi, can I steal you for a private word? Something important.""

I blinked, caught off guard. ""Uh, sure,"" I said, glancing at the others.

""Don’t worry,"" Jesse said with a grin. ""Won’t take long. Just need to discuss a couple of executive-level details.""

As I followed Jesse out of the room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something more going on. But with Jesse, there always was.

 

**\[Fast-Forwarding Transcript: One Minute\]**

 

Jesse’s executive office was everything you’d expect from the President of MultiVer Solutions: oversized, ostentatious, and oozing with charm designed to impress. The walls were lined with a mix of Earth and alien artwork, some abstract, some historical, and some purely decorative. The floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of Atlanta, stretching out beneath us like a glittering grid of ambition and opportunity.

Jesse gestured to a pair of leather armchairs situated around a glass coffee table, where a carafe of water and two glasses were already waiting. “Take a seat, Jovi. Make yourself comfortable.”

I sat, the chair swallowing me in plush comfort, while Jesse leaned against the edge of his desk, arms crossed, his polished demeanor still firmly in place.

“So,” he began, his voice measured and almost conspiratorial, “I wanted to have a little one-on-one with you. Strictly off the record.”

I raised an eyebrow. “What’s this about?”

Jesse smiled, the kind of smile that said he was about to sell you something. “Jovi, you’ve done an exceptional job with this show. The buzz, the viewership numbers—it’s all beyond what we could’ve hoped for.”

“Thanks,” I said, unsure where this was going.

“But,” he continued, tilting his head slightly, “I can’t help but wonder about the… circumstances that got us here. The leak, specifically.”

I sighed, already feeling defensive. “Like I said in the meeting, none of us had anything to do with it. We’ve just been rolling with the punches.”

Jesse’s smile widened, but there was something sharper in his eyes now. “Of course, of course. I believe you. But you’ve got to admit, it’s an interesting situation. These things don’t just happen out of thin air. Someone had access, someone made a choice. And it’s lucky for us it was such a *calculated* leak, don’t you think?”

I shrugged. “I guess? But like I said, it wasn’t us. Maybe someone higher up in the company decided to generate some buzz without telling us.”

Jesse laughed lightly. “Oh, Jovi. You’re a straight shooter, and I admire that about you. But sometimes, you’ve got to loỏ̶̮ʞ̶̹̍ ̵̦̏ɒ̶̪̈́ ̷̼̆l̷̀͜i̸̤͊Ɉ̸̫̓Ɉ̴̛͓l̵̢͝ɘ̷̳̔ ̵̪̑ɔ̴͕̂l̴̪̀o̶̜̚ƨ̶͕̍ɘ̸̳̽ɿ̵̰͐ ̴̘̇Ɉ̷̬̿ö̸̲ ̷̺̄ʜ̶͍͆o̴̳̾

The room felt hollow the moment Jovi and Jesse slipped out, and I had the uneasy sense that they’d taken the last bit of stable ground with them. I tried not to show it, but my stomach was in knots. Flurin’s restless tapping on the table only made things worse—each tap felt like a countdown to something I didn’t want to hear.

Max glanced from Flurin to me, as if assessing the damage before speaking. “Danny? Flurin has something to tell you.”

My chest tightened. I looked over at Flurin, who was busy staring at his own hands. His cheeks had that faint bluish flush that meant he was beyond nervous.

“Oh?” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “And what do you have to say?”

Flurin opened his mouth, shut it, then inhaled like he was about to dive into deep water- something I’m told actually happened during filming that got written into the episode. “A while back… during filming,” he began slowly, “Jovi told me about the post-credits scene from the pilot. The one you didn’t want to include. They… wanted my advice on how to convince you to keep it.”

I frowned, my mind immediately racing back to all the times Jovi and I had fought over them not telling me about the scene. “They did? So… why didn’t they tell me that?”

Flurin squirmed, his gaze flicking to Max as if begging for rescue. He seemed lost for words.

“Well, I… The fact is… umm—”

I felt a prickle of irritation, but more than that, dread. This was something big, and I could feel it in my gut. I waited for him to continue, but he just sat there looking like he wanted the floor to swallow him. That’s when Max spoke up, huffing in frustration.

 

“He told Jovi that if they told you anything about it,” she said, “he’d walk.”

Her words crashed over me like a bucket of ice. All I could do was stare, trying to comprehend what that meant. Slowly, the anger I expected never came. Instead, my heart sank. It was like watching a treasured plate from my grandmother’s wedding china hit the floor and shatter into a thousand pieces—beyond repair.

“You… put Jovi in that position?” My own voice sounded hollow. “Having to choose between me and you?”

For a moment, my eyes flicked to the door where Jovi had gone. In my head, I replayed the last month or so—every argument, every moment of mistrust. I’d accused Jovi of not respecting my legal knowledge, of brushing my advice aside. But now, it turned out they’d been stuck between a rock and a hard place, forced into silence by Flurin’s ultimatum. They hadn’t wanted to lie—maybe they’d just felt they had no choice.

Flurin’s head dropped, and he looked absolutely miserable. “I thought… I mean, I never planned for it to go so far. I was just… sure that scene was vital for the show, and I said it without thinking. I never realized it would… hurt you both like this.”

My throat tightened, a thousand half-formed thoughts and emotions tangling in my mind: betrayal, regret, a fierce protective instinct for Jovi. Mostly, though, I just felt an awful, sinking guilt for doubting Jovi’s apology before. They didn’t tell me about Flurin’s ultimatum, and it only took a brief moment for me to understand why:

 

It was because they didn’t want to deflect the blame. They really meant it when they told me they were sorry.

 

I swallowed hard and closed my eyes, trying to process it all. A month of confusion, unraveling in minutes. It hit me just how deeply Jovi must have been hurting—because of a decision Flurin made, and because I had refused to believe the sincerity of their apology, even if I never actually said anything.

Funny. Now all that frustration has nowhere to go.

 

Dammit.

 

We didn’t talk after that, not for a solid few minutes that felt like eternity.

I held my head in my hands.

*Now what? The only person who hasn’t made any stupid mistakes is Max, and I doubt she’ll do anything like that any time soon.*

 

But then the door opened, and Jovi and Mr. Multin stepped back into the room. Jovi looked… contemplative. Like Mr. Multin had given him something to chew on.

The rest of the meeting went by like a blur after that. Before I knew it, we had discussed New Orleans Comic Con, the set-up, the panel…

 

And before I knew it, Jovi was driving down to his hometown, and we were headed to the airport to fly to Baton Rouge.

 

~~I wish I had gone with him to Holcombville.~~

\[Jesse:\] “Tweety-Bird. Got a moment?”

\[Jan:\] “Always, for my better half.”

\[Jesse:\] “Flatterer. You won the bet, by the way.”

\[Jan:\] “Oh? They didn’t pick up on what you were trying to say? But I have it on good word that Mr. Rosee is a very perceptive person who wasn’t the type to miss subtle hints, and Jesse Multin is the type to get his message across without needed to outright say anything.”

\[Jesse:\] “Okay, okay, you were right. My fast-talking got the better of me and they got nervous. I’ll give you the usual sum the next time we meet in person. The question now is, what do we do?”

\[Jan:\] “Fortunately, we have already explored this as a potential outcome.”

\[Jesse:\] “You keep coming up with increasingly creative ways to say ‘I told you so.’”

\[Jan:\] “What can I say? I write a lot of business emails. Since your attempt at subtly went over Mr. Rosee’s head, our next step is to simply tell them the truth.”

\[Jesse:\] “That we want Foxton gone? You know they’ll never accept that. In fact, I dare say they’d sooner quit than fire their best friend, and ultimately, we need Jovi's skills.”

\[Jan:\] “Not the *whole* truth. Just enough that they'll do what we need them to do. Tell him about Daniel compromising the drive, that I managed to intercept it before anything substantial was leaked, just omit that I purposely leaked the scene and that the original compromising was an accident. Foxton will look even more like a liability, Mr. Rosee will fire him, and Foxton won't compromise our plan.”

\[Jesse:\] “Well, that's going to be a problem. Foxton, Collingwood, and Flurin have already left for Baton Rouge, and Mr. Rosee is making their way to Holcombville for their family's Fourth of July party.”

\[Jan:\] “Fortunately, time is not of the essence here, and our paths will soon cross again. I'll make sure to tell Dad about the situation. We'll be in New Orleans with the nephews for ComicCon, and he can tell Mr. Rosee everything then.”

\[Jesse:\] “Fair enough. So, speaking of, how’s everything on your end? How’s Dad?”

\[Jan:\] “He’s… managing. Better with policy than politics, as always, but he’s kept things steady since the Kingdom was reformed. The Church is still a headache, though. They split from a temporal head once, odds are, they're brave enough to try again.""

\[Jesse:\] “When aren’t they? He’s lucky to have you running interference.”

\[Jan:\] “And you, for that matter. MultiVer’s reach keeps them from getting too bold. Speaking of, keep an eye on Jovi. We need them focused on the show, not Foxton or anything else. If they starts digging too deep…”

\[Jesse:\] “I’ll handle it. Don’t worry. You just focus on keeping Osca Hall in one piece.”

\[Jan:\] “Deal. And Jesse?”

\[Jesse:\] “Yeah?”

\[Jan:\] “Don’t forget my winnings. I like my victories sweetened.”

\[Jesse:\] “You’ll get your dollar, sis. I’m nothing if not a man of my word.”

\[Jan:\] “Good. Talk soon, Jay-Jay.”

\[Jesse:\] “Always, Tweety-Bird.”

Hi fellow rats, Hongkonger here, seems like many of western rats haven't tried yuenyueng(coffee with milktea) yet. Here's its story and reasons why you should absolutely try it.

In the 70s, Hong Kong was booming in its economy under the British, many employees were busy working days to nights and they tired af in the mornings. So what did they do? Well milktea wokege, coffee wokege, milktea+coffee=2(wokege). And surprisingly, it tasted fantastic. Cha chaan tengs (cantonese restaurants) started to standardize them into their menus, becoming one of Hong Kong's signature beverages. So what's behind the name yuenyueng? Well yuenyueng in its own means the brid mandarin duck, which always come in pairs of couples. In chinese the phrase yuenyueng(鴛鴦) is often used to describe couples that they are sweet. But here it's a metaphor that coffee and milktea are mixed together. Who named this? I don't know, probably some restaurant waiters that was busy shouting at their customers when they asked what is this.

So why should you try this? It is yummy and that's enough. In addition, it is fking easy to prepare, just search up any recipes on the internet and they works fine. Lastly, who don't want to be insanely wokege in the morning with very cheap price that taste delicious but not 30-50hkd a drink in starbucks or whatever coffee shops? I hereby appeal to all of you rats that never tried yuenyueng, drink this gold next time before you go to work or school, and promote it to your friends.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When living in a tiny home, every square inch matters, especially in your kitchen. Maximizing space while ensuring functionality is crucial. Choosing the right kitchen appliances can transform your limited area into a culinary haven. Below are essential appliances that can elevate your tiny home kitchen experience:

### Compact Refrigerators

A compact refrigerator is a must-have in any tiny home. These units are smaller than traditional refrigerators yet provide ample space for your essentials. Look for models with adjustable shelves and energy-efficient features to save on electricity bills. The mini-fridge is not just practical; it can also come with a freezer compartment for frozen foods, making it a versatile choice for all your grocery needs.

### Induction Cooktops

Induction cooktops are ideal for tiny kitchens where space is limited. These cooktops are sleek and fast, allowing you to cook efficiently without taking up too much room. They heat up quickly and can be turned down instantly, giving you precise control over your cooking. Plus, they are easy to clean, as spills do not burn onto the surface.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-appliances  
  
### Microwave Convection Ovens

A microwave convection oven is a game-changer for tiny home kitchens. This two-in-one appliance allows you to microwave, bake, and even roast. With the heat of a convection oven and the speed of a microwave, you can prepare meals quickly and efficiently. Look for one that fits on your countertop but still has a spacious interior.

### Multi-Cookers

Consider investing in a multi-cooker, which can replace several kitchen gadgets. A device like the Instant Pot can pressure cook, slow cook, sauté, steam, and even make yogurt. This not only saves space but also simplifies cooking. You can whip up a variety of dishes, from soups to desserts, all in one pot.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-appliances  
  
### Food Processors

A compact food processor is another essential appliance that can significantly streamline your cooking process. These machines can chop, slice, and puree ingredients with ease. Choose a small food processor that can do the work of a knife without taking too much space on your countertop. A good food processor can help you prepare soups, sauces, and even dough quickly.

### Electric Kettles

An electric kettle is perfect for tiny home living. It heats water quickly for tea, coffee, or even instant meals. Some models even offer temperature control, which is ideal for tea enthusiasts. An electric kettle is compact yet highly functional, making it a great addition to your kitchen.

#### Space-Saving Tips for Kitchen Appliances

- **Choose Stackable Appliances:** Look for appliances that can stack or fit into each other. This helps save valuable counter space.
- **Wall-Mounted Solutions:** Consider using wall-mounted solutions for items like pots and pans. This keeps them off the counters and frees up space.
- **Use Multifunctional Appliances:** Invest in appliances that serve multiple purposes to minimize the number of gadgets you need.

### Countertop Grills

If you love grilling but have limited outdoor space, a countertop grill is an excellent option. It gives you the delicious taste of grilled food without needing a large grill setup. Models that can also double as griddles offer even more versatility for cooking breakfast or quesadillas.

### Blenders

A high-quality blender can be an essential tool in your tiny home kitchen. Whether you are making smoothies, soups, or sauces, a blender can handle it all. Opt for a compact design that fits seamlessly on your counter and choose one with a powerful motor and multiple speed options.

### Final Thoughts on Tiny Home Kitchen Appliances

In a tiny home, choosing the right kitchen appliances can make all the difference. Focus on compact, multifunctional, and energy-efficient devices that cater to your cooking needs without overwhelming your space. These essential tiny home kitchen appliances will not only fit your lifestyle but also enhance your culinary adventures.

Innovative Design Ideas for Tiny Home Kitchens: Appliances and Layout Considerations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to tiny home kitchens, every inch matters. The right kitchen appliances can transform a cramped space into a highly functional cooking area that feels more spacious and efficient. In this article, we will explore innovative design ideas that balance the need for essential appliances with the charm of a tiny kitchen.

### Space-Saving Appliances

One of the most critical considerations in a tiny home kitchen is choosing the right appliances that maximize space. Here are some space-saving options:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-kitchen-appliances  
  
- **Compact Refrigerators:** Opt for a slimline refrigerator that fits snugly under a counter. These models offer sufficient space for groceries without overwhelming the kitchen.
- **Multi-Functional Cookers:** Devices like an Instant Pot can act as a pressure cooker, slow cooker, steamer, and more, reducing the number of separate appliances needed.
- **Built-In Dishwashers:** A slim, built-in dishwasher can fit beneath the countertop, blending into the kitchen's design and saving space without sacrificing convenience.

### Creative Storage Solutions

In a tiny kitchen, clever storage is essential, not just for appliances, but for cookware, utensils, and food. Maximize your kitchen storage with these ideas:

- **Vertical Racks:** Use vertical racks to store pots and pans. Hanging them from the ceiling or wall not only saves space but creates a rustic look.
- **Pull-Out Cabinets:** Implement pull-out cabinets that can hide away appliances like microwaves or coffee machines. This keeps the counter clear and adds### Conclusion
    
    Creating a functional and inviting kitchen in your tiny home is all about making smart choices. By selecting essential tiny home kitchen appliances, you can maximize your limited space while still enjoying the convenience of modern cooking. Focus on multi-functional items, like an Instant Pot or a compact blender, to enhance your culinary experience without overcrowding your kitchen.
    
    Moreover, innovative design ideas play a crucial role in how your tiny kitchen operates. Consider the layout carefully, utilizing vertical storage solutions and clever cabinetry to keep your appliances organized and accessible. This means selecting appliances that can be easily stored away or integrated into your kitchen design, ensuring that everything has its place when not in use.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie for sh*ts and giggles. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

This isn't for everyone but Ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

We study at uni together. He's a very nice guy, smart and open-minded. I found myself helping him when he broke up with his ex at the beginning of last-year. We spent a lot of time talking and chatting. There was space both for light-hearted things and for serious matters. We shared two beautiful and funny travels. He's one of the most important people in my life.

At one point, in June/July, I realized I had feelings for him. I gave myself time to process this, with the help of my therapist too. In November I confessed to him. He took it well at first, and told me he couldn't match my feelings because he could never be in a romantic relationship with a man. Of course I respect that and I found our way of handling this very beautiful at the beginning: we were very comunicative about it, and in the following month we had the chance to talk about it again in a coffee shop. In that occasion I felt happy because he told me that he was scared to hurt my feelings by sending some memes or talking about his ex or whatever happens in his romantic life. I told him to not hold back, because it's up to me to tell him if he is hurting me. I really want to be by his side and help him when he is struggling with such matters. A few days later we had a hang out with his older sister (I met her that very day), and everything was calm and beautiful, we even made plans to spend some time together. Me and my best friend were both aligned on being sort of ""brothers"" and having a platonic relationship (he agreed on such things).

More than month passed, we haven't seen each other for three weeks because of Christmas holidays and we didn't chat as usual. I suddenly felt a wall building between us. And when we met again each other two weeks ago things didn't feel the same. And I don't know why. I felt heartbroken and yesterday I decided to talk to him calmly.

I asked him if he felt this distance too. He said that yes, he feels something has changed. I asked if there was something in my behavior that made him want to change the way we interact with each other. He told me that no, no nothing happened, it's just him ""self-sabotaging"" because he doesn't want to hurt me  nor delude me. I told him that since we spoke clearly I've never thought about us as a romantic couple anymore. I looked it from a best friendship pov and told him I wanted to be the two best friends we were before. I understand what he told me about ""not doing others what he would not want done to him"", but at the same time I expressed delicately that he should not assume things about how I am handling things internally. He told me ""it's not that easy"".

He told me that he trusts my words but at the same time he ""has no way to verify they are true"". That was a hard hit.

I suspect there is something related to his past that makes this self-sabotage side take over him. Maybe he fears being potentially hurt by this and he is keeping the friendship but distancing from me. I find it really absurd how just a month ago he wrote to me that he was ""happy that we we found a way to stay best friends and he hopes and trusts in me that I will be able to handle this"". He even had three days of self-sabotaging during which he wouldn't speak to me, then came back to normal admitting that ""he wasn't being his true self and felt bad for that"". *** And now, just a month later, he behaves like this without nothing being happened between us.

Towards the end of our talk I agreed that maybe we both need more more lightheartedness and don't talk of the ""heavy"" things between us. As of now I find myself very confused, I'd like to write to him about those messages he sent me back then (***) and tell him that I feel very bad for losing him as a best friend without knowing why. At the same time, I feel talking about it again would be against the ""being more lighthearted"" thing.

Do you think talking with his sister about this would be appropriate?

I'm seeking for words of comfort, or for advice if you are willing to. Thank you <3",1,1737793645.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Here’s my question: 

Since I was 9, I’ve had this tiny little chip on one of my front teeth. I got a filling for it around that age and it fell off about 12 years later, about when I was 19. I then got another filling at 19, which then fell again about two years later. The third time, at about age 25, my dentist filled the chip with composite yet again. It’s a small chip. I told him when he was filling it out to not drill a lot of it because i care about how big it gets, I didn’t want it bigger. Fast forward almost four years later, i notice that I am getting a stain where the composite resin edge meets the real tooth enamel. It’s small but it’s there. I ran my finger nail over the edge and I can tell that it’s stained right at the edge of the two materials. Why did my dentist use composite all the way to the middle of the tooth when the chip was by the corner? I can tell because the resis is matte and the tooth is shiny? Can I get the stain out?

1i9igfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i9igfg/go_nc_with_family_after_they_betrayed_me/,Go nc with family after they betrayed me?,"I (34F) grew up in an unstable environment full of family drama. I've been living abroad for many years now.

Most of my family always criticised my choices. I am the first one to have a degree (I have two) and to move abroad, so we're very different people. For example, when I said I was moving to a new country (I lived in different places), I was laughed at straight to my face and told ""I have no home"", or when I opened a business, they said it was destined to fail. Despite all this, I have built a decent life for myself. And with time, I learned to take my distance from them.

Fast forward to a few months ago, I lived together with the man I thought was the love of my life. We were happy. Then he found a good job in his home country and told me to follow him there asap to have our family and children. I quit my job, left my apartment, and a few weeks before reuniting he broke up with me via text. I was blindsided. Heartbroken, homeless, jobless. My friends helped me with housing while I looked for another job. I thought I could do better financially, as the country I was living in is expensive especially for a single woman who doesn't share a house, so I looked for a place with a better balance salary-cost of life, and went back to my home country to prepare my visa after finding it.

I was happy for the job but still emotionally messed up due to what happened, so I thought to meet my relatives next time as I was too vulnerable to talk with them now. They knew about my move to my ex's country so I would have had to explain this 180° life change. I am not good at lying and knew that I would start crying once asked ""how are you?"". After a month, one of my aunts (55F) called me to meet for a coffee. She was the aunt who helped me the most among them growing up, and even though there were a couple episodes that made me lose trust, I still had some hope with her and I agreed. As predicted, I cried when she asked me how things were. I decided to give her a chance and told her what happened. Then she said to text her to meet again, and left to meet my other aunt (first red flag). Long story short, I texted her shortly after, and she never replied. My cousins (her daughters) texted me out of the blue after some days (they never do - other red flag), but I cut it short as I felt they were contacting me because they were told about my coming move and wanted to benefit from it. I may be wrong, but I felt like my aunt just met me to know my business and spread gossip around. I felt fooled, betrayed. After days I got to know that she was asking around about me. Then I met her by chance the day after, which was not really by chance but her asking where I was and coming there. When I saw her, I asked ""is everything ok? I texted you and you didn't reply"" and she said that she maybe saw the message but had her mind in the clouds, and basically flipped the script and made it about me not going to her house, so the fault was mine since I didn't visit her. I told her no, that I was waiting for her reply. Of course I could've visited her or sent her a reminder, but I am tired of chasing people: she said to text her, I texted her, she didn't reply. That's it. She then said that my cousins will come visit once I'm settled, confirming that she talked about our conversation at least with them (but likely with the others too).

Sometimes I feel bad for wanting to go nc because I have some nice memories with her growing up, but I am tired of this. I did so much to build a life for myself, find balance and feel happy and at peace, but every time I come back home I feel like the teenager of 20 - 15 years ago. Am I right to go nc with her too?

I was going through a rough patch with some mental health issues, changing my major and career path completely, and stress from school and an internship and work, leaving me with practically no time at all. It got to the point where I was lucky if I saw her more than once a month. 

I was so guilty and she’s my first ever real relationship and I jumped the gun, thinking it was for the better that we remain friends, that I was wasting her time by being too busy. Ultimately, the timing was off and it sucked. 

I asked to be friends, she seemed okay and agreed but when I got home and we texted a little that night, she stopped all communication. She still follows me on socials and whatnot, but we haven’t talked or texted since that night.

I wanted to share my journey as a full-stack Java developer over the past 7 years. It's been a road filled with challenges, growth, late-night coding sessions, and countless cups of coffee. I hope my story resonates with some of you and maybe even helps those just starting out or considering a career in tech. Seven years ago, fresh out of university, I landed my first job as a junior developer. I was thrown into the deep end, working on enterprise web applications using Spring Boot and Angular. Back then, I was just trying to keep my head above water, grappling with new technologies and the pace of the industry.

* **Diving into Databases:** Early on, I got my hands dirty with SQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Each database presented its own set of challenges, but mastering them was crucial for backend development.
* **Embracing Microservices:** About 4.5 years ago, our team made the monumental shift from a monolithic architecture to microservices. I spent countless hours understanding the intricacies of designing, developing, and deploying microservices. Tools like Kubernetes and Docker became everyday essentials.
* **Cloud Adventures:** Working with AWS and GCP was both exciting and daunting. Over the years, I learned the nuances of cloud services, from scaling applications to optimizing costs.
* **Messaging Systems:** Implementing RabbitMQ and Kafka was a game-changer. It taught me the importance of asynchronous communication and building resilient systems.

**Challenges Faced:**

* **The Monolith to Microservices Migration:** This was one of the most challenging projects I undertook. It wasn't just about changing code but also about changing mindsets. Coordinating with multiple teams, ensuring minimal downtime, and handling unexpected issues tested my skills to the limit.
* **Leading a Team:** Two years ago, I was given the opportunity to lead a small team of 3 to 5 developers. Transitioning from being an individual contributor to a leader was tough. I had to learn to delegate, mentor, and inspire while still keeping up with my own tasks.
* **Keeping Up with Technology:** The tech world moves fast. Staying updated with the latest frameworks, tools, and best practices required continuous learning and sometimes, unlearning old habits.

**Lessons Learned:**

1. **Never Stop Learning:** The moment you think you know everything is the moment you start falling behind. Embrace new technologies and be open to change.
2. **Mentorship is Priceless:** Having mentors helped me navigate tough times. Now, I try to pay it forward by guiding others.
3. **Communication is Key:** Whether it's with your team, stakeholders, or clients, clear communication can prevent many issues.
4. **Balance is Essential:** Burnout is real. It's important to find a balance between work and personal life to stay productive and happy.

**Why I'm Sharing This:**

Looking back, I realize how valuable it would have been to have someone share real-world experiences with me when I was starting out. Reddit has been a great community for me over the years, so I wanted to give back by sharing my story.

**Ask Me Anything:**

Whether you're curious about full-stack development, considering a move to microservices, navigating cloud technologies, or wondering about transitioning into leadership roles, feel free to ask! I'm here to share insights, mistakes, and advice.

**Edit:** Wow, thank you all for the amazing responses! I'll be going through your questions and answering them as best as I can. If anyone wants to dive deeper or chat one-on-one, feel free to reach out.",1,1737792739.0,careerguidance,6,1.0,False

I have been spiraling for months because of this neurally degenerative disease. All I see online for advice is take your meds everyday and engage your mind.
