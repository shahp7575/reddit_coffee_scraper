I‚Äôve attached a photo of my dining room. My wife wants to have custom shelving/coffee bar installed along the entire wall, but there is an intake vent.
 
Is it possible to have that vent relocated or is there anyway to work around this?  I wouldnt be doing this myself. Would this be a hefty pricey project? The only thing I can think of is to have it raised closer to the ceiling.

Now a days, my acne and eczema are under control as well as oil production. No more watery eyes or runny nose! Below are make-up and skin care products I use almost daily with a little blurb about why I like it. Feel free to ask me any questions!

  
Make-up:¬†

* Jane Iredale pressed powder foundation- evens out my skin tone while looking so natural. Tons of shades and undertones available.¬†
* Kosas Bronzer or 100% Pure- makes me feel like a bronze goddess! Little goes a long way.¬†

* 100% Pure Bamboo Blur Powder- This is a finishing powder that sets my make-up and minimizes the appearance of pores. Silky smooth texture and it‚Äôs tinted to closely match your skin tone

* Jane Iredale tubing mascara- makes my lashes look crazy long. Doesn‚Äôt smudge or flake on my oily skin but it makes my sink dirty.¬†

* Kosas powder blush or 100% Pure- multidimensional and beautiful

* Kosas concealer - I‚Äôve gone through 3 tubes of this. So many undertones available. Creamy, easy to blend

* Exa Beauty color corrector in Yellow- brightens my under eye wonderfully¬†

* Fitglow powder eye shadow - easy to blend and great color play off

* Ilia eyebrow pencil- easy to use + natural looking

* Ilia brow gel- keeps my downturn eyebrow hairs upturned and in place all day.

* Jane iredale lipliner- love all the brown shades. Longish lasting

* Thrive cosmetics eyeshadow stick- I use this on my lower lash line. Doesn‚Äôt budge.¬†

* Fitglow eyeliner in Beige for my waterline- great for those who don‚Äôt want stark white waterline. ¬†

* RMS cake liner that‚Äôs no longer available, unfortunately.¬†



Skin care-¬†

* Fitglow Cloud Comfort Cream- hydrating and non greasy¬†

* Saint Jane Sun Ritual Sunscreen- sits so well under my make-up

* Mad Hippie Blemish Cream- helps reduce my acne

* Acure facial cleanser- nothing special about this lol just a cleanser I pick up at my local co-op.¬†



Honorable mentions

* Josephine Cosmetics liquid eyeliner¬† is hands down the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used. Dark pigment, crazy staying power. I just don‚Äôt like felt pen liners because they dry out so quickly.¬†

* Soshe Beauty gel eyeliner. Absolute best gel pencil liner I‚Äôve used but it only lasts me 2 weeks with daily use üò≠ heartbroken over this. Incredible staying power and I love the micro-tip.¬†",1,1732658895.0,cleanbeauty,0,1.0,False

1h0o6om,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnyoneKnow/comments/1h0o6om/a_dream_within_a_dream/,A dream within a dream,"OK so this happened to me last night and it was freaking weird waking up from it! The initial dream went like this:

I woke up early for work and had some time to kill so chilled on the couch with my partner and watched some tv but then I fell asleep and woke up and I knew I was late for work but couldn't tell how late I was because the time on my phone, the time on the tv and the time on the wall clock were all showing different times. So I rush to work and frantically fire up my laptop to check the time - only to realise I wasn't late at all...panic over.

Then I wake up in the second dream having dreamt I was late and I jokingly message one of my clients that I dreamt I was late for our appointment. I then go about getting ready and head to work and drive to my first appointment of the day (not the client I messaged earlier). On the way, the rain is pouring down so hard, I think it must have been a storm so I have to pull over and call the client I am on my way to, to say I'm not going to make it to their appointment.
I then realise I'm not going to make it back in time for my next client appointment (the one I messaged earlier joking about dreaming about being late) as I'm basically stranded at this point. 
While I'm trying to figure out how I can somehow get to this client, even if a little late - I go into a little cafe and get some coffee and a cake and they suggest I get the train (because for some unknown reason the car is not an option).
All of a sudden my partner turns up there and I ask him if he has his car with him which he does but he can't use it either (I'm thinking the storm must have made the roads a no go).

So we both decide to get the train to where I need to be. We get on the train and it is like an old fashioned but quite fancy train - but the storm has been so bad, water is almost up to the carridge platform/balcony we are standing on and need to hold on to a rail to steady ourselves.
We then find out that the train doesn't actually stop directly at the station we need to get to so we will need to do a changeover at the next stop and I realise I am not going to make it at all to the client appointment.

And that's when I woke up IRL and realised that I dreamed a dream about being late! 
And of course IRL I had to get up and go to a work and have appointments with clients, all the while with all of this in my head!

I looked it up and it freaked me out a little even more! This is some Edgar Allan Poe / Inception shit!

1h0o6jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphop101/comments/1h0o6jb/overdone_but_id_like_to_talk_about_drakekendrick/,"Overdone, but I'd like to talk about Drake/Kendrick, specifically what's going on right now.","Couldn't think of anywhere else where to post this. I'd like to please have an *objective* discussion about the lawsuit.

Reddit is an echo chamber, so it's difficult to get an objective, accurate take on what's going on right now. Each relevant subreddit took a side, can't talk rationally. Full disclosure, not a Drake fan, love Kendrick. What I'm trying to talk about, and figure out, is mainly this, please, I beg you, do what I'm doing, leave your biases at the door for a moment, consider every possibility without judgment:

- Do you think there is a possibility that UMG, either with or without Kendrick's knowledge, artificially boosted NLU's numbers?

Personally, I think they probably marketed it as they would any other popular song. Their goal is to make money, this isn't surprising. They did the same thing with Drake, back when Scorpion dropped and it was everywhere on Spotify, couldn't escape it. Drake in general has always been pushed heavily on Spotify. This is normal to me.

I don't know whether they used bots though. It's a very different thing from pushing it, and inserting it into playlists, which again is normal for a popular song. They posted [this](https://preview.redd.it/z9jezyzpoa3e1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=39ac95b44153b2e5980a3dcc35c29f3867712913), I don't think this is proof, the views count on YouTube is notoriously messed up and not accurate for very recent videos. I understand why it would be suspicious though, but it's not proof.

One more thing, bots were active during the beef. I saw it myself in the comments of almost every song, for both sides. Generic accounts, making very similar comments. It was obvious. But this was a highly publicized event, on the internet, which is now FULL of bots. It does not mean either Drake or Kendrick, or their labels, had a hand in it. It could easily just be fans. [Reminder, during the Pusha T beef, Twitter was flooded with bots making weird accusations that he's a lizard and other weird shit.](https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/790254-drake-kendrick-lamar-ai-leaks-response-joe-budden-hip-hop-news)

It's a lose-lose for him, clearly. If he's wrong, he looks terrible. But if UMG *did* do what he's accusing them of, then he gains more money, but still looks like a sore loser, this won't sway public opinion. It's hard to understand why he would do this besides pettiness, honestly. He does not need money, he's in the hundreds of millions, probably will become a billionaire at some point. Is more money worth further damage to his reputation?

Anyway, I'm having a cup of coffee, it's snowing, felt like yapping, if you don't feel like reading this, no hard feelings lol.

tldr: Think objectively, could Drake be justified in his lawsuit? Even if he is, is it truly worth it? And even if he is, could he even prove it?",2,1732658585.0,hiphop101,2,0.67,False

# Unveiling the Powerhouse Ingredients: A Closer Look

Java Burn's developers tout a range of potential benefits that could significantly enhance your health journey. Here's a closer look:

**Enhanced Metabolism:**

A key focus of Java Burn is its ability to potentially boost your metabolic rate. By increasing metabolic activity, your body burns more calories at rest, leading to a potential increase in weight loss. ¬†

The synergy between the ingredients in Java Burn and the natural caffeine in your coffee may lead to sustained energy throughout the day. This can improve your focus, productivity, and overall well-being. ¬†

L-Theanine, a prominent ingredient in Java Burn, is known for promoting relaxation and focus. This can counter the jitters often associated with coffee and leave you feeling energized yet composed. ¬†

All my previous attempts have withered away after a few days, maybe I am doing something wrong?

so about me? I am 26, living in the UK but hopeful to move one day. I work for a very popular company that I cannot say the name of, but you'll have heard of them before. My primary passion in life has always been my work and I feel like it's time that shifted to someone else, so that's why I am here!

I am an avid reader, my bookcase is full of books i've yet to read and a lot of have read and cannot come to terms with giving away. If I am not reading I will likely be sat under a blanket somewhere in my house playing video games. As with most people on Reddit, I am indeed a huge nerd.

As for other things I like to do:

\- Stumble into things, I am very clumsy. Drink an ungodly amount of coffee, listen to music far too loud on my headphones, order too much food for myself and regret it later, pretend like I understand politics, suck at boardgames and sing karaoke.

1h0nyhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dream/comments/1h0nyhe/a_dream_within_a_dream/,A dream within a dream,"OK so this happened to me last night and it was freaking weird waking up from it! The initial dream went like this:

I woke up early for work and had some time to kill so chilled on the couch with my partner and watched some tv but then I fell asleep and woke up and I knew I was late for work but couldn't tell how late I was because the time on my phone, the time on the tv and the time on the wall clock were all showing different times. So I rush to work and frantically fire up my laptop to check the time - only to realise I wasn't late at all...panic over.

Then I wake up in the second dream having dreamt I was late and I jokingly message one of my clients that I dreamt I was late for our appointment. I then go about getting ready and head to work and drive to my first appointment of the day (not the client I messaged earlier). On the way, the rain is pouring down so hard, I think it must have been a storm so I have to pull over and call the client I am on my way to, to say I'm not going to make it to their appointment.
I then realise I'm not going to make it back in time for my next client appointment (the one I messaged earlier joking about dreaming about being late) as I'm basically stranded at this point. 
While I'm trying to figure out how I can somehow get to this client, even if a little late - I go into a little cafe and get some coffee and a cake and they suggest I get the train (because for some unknown reason the car is not an option).
All of a sudden my partner turns up there and I ask him if he has his car with him which he does but he can't use it either (I'm thinking the storm must have made the roads a no go).

So we both decide to get the train to where I need to be. We get on the train and it is like an old fashioned but quite fancy train - but the storm has been so bad, water is almost up to the carridge platform/balcony we are standing on and need to hold on to a rail to steady ourselves.
We then find out that the train doesn't actually stop directly at the station we need to get to so we will need to do a changeover at the next stop and I realise I am not going to make it at all to the client appointment.

And that's when I woke up IRL and realised that I dreamed a dream about being late! 
And of course IRL I had to get up and go to a work and have appointments with clients, all the while with all of this in my head!

I looked it up and it freaked me out a little even more! This is some Edgar Allan Poe / Inception shit!

There are very few issues I can come up with for the plot of this season. Most of the progression and character decisions make sense, every skipped over part of the plot is easily inferrable from what we are given and every scene serves its purpose very well, multiple purposes, even, at some points.

It's a technical marvel, to write a show with such density of information without getting lost in the sauce and making it incimprehensible. It has everything a good season of television needs.

But the problem, funny enough, was kind of described by one of the show's characters - Heimerdinger and his arc in it. 

And that is it's not enough to have what you need in life, but what you want too.

I think the irony of this show is that by making the plot as polished, and efficient and optimized as possible, by giving us everything the show was supposed to give, they ditched the excess that would have grounded it and made it more human. 

I've come to realize, that unnecessary character moments that would have bogged down the pace and extended the show for very seemingly no reason and probably would have made it harder to fit the episodes into set runtimes and season lengths aren't noticed when they're there, but they're felt when they aren't.

It's a hard thing to grasp for me, personally, and I think the writers feel similarly. If you approach this season's script from a purely technical standpoint, it's pretty damn brilliant how much stuff it was able to achieve. My optimization focused brain seemingly can't find any structural flaw with it. But that just shows how limited my view of what a story is supposed to be is. 

Because I'm looking at this perfectly sculptured 5% body fat bodybuilder in front of me and even though my consciousness tells me that this is peak animated show performance, something inside me tells me, that he would have looked better with more body fat. 

The problem is that I can't figure out where the middle ground is and how I would even go about improving what we have. A whole bunch of people just want to see characters they like do stuff, preferably happy stuff. That's all well and good, but you don't make a good show made out purely fat, that's what coffee shop fanfics are for. But at the same time, this perfectly fit show that has achieved 100% efficiency in its story delivery doesn't sit right with people, and to an extent myself, too. 

Would one more episode have made it better? One more act? If yes, what would it be about, what part of what we have would you extend, where would be the splits between acts? Should they have not bothered with this structure at all? If there had been an extra couple of episodes, what would they have been filled with? All episodes end on pretty good cliffhangers, should they not have?

And in the end, how do you do all that knowing, that what you're adding is excessive to the story you want to tell, that it would be fine without it?

This post has been my unresolved stream of consciousness, grappling with questions professional writers had to face and didn't find an answer to. For what it's worth, I think they did a great job. I'm going to sleep now. ",2,1732657884.0,arcane,2,0.75,False

Picture this: a small-town guy (me), tired of the modern dating scene (also me), sees all these cute Christmas couples and families simultaneously warming and breaking his heart, realises what he needs in his life ‚Äîa quirky yet lovable girlfriend to make his life feel like a cheesy movie. That‚Äôs where you come in.

The Plot:
I‚Äôm the slightly disheveled, unexpectedly charming protagonist. 

You‚Äôre the kind-hearted, quick-witted woman who helps me rediscover the magic of love (and maybe how to properly fold fitted sheets). 

Together, we‚Äôll overcome minor misunderstandings, laugh over spilled coffee, and realise we were meant to be together all along. 

Cue the snow falling gently in the background. Hopefully this becomes a blockbuster hit cos I would quite like at least a sequel and 15 different spin offs. 

About Me:

I‚Äôm your classic loveable underdog: warm, a little awkward, sometimes mischievous, but always ready with a heartfelt compliment and remembering the little things. 

I am 30 years old, chubby/cuddley, dark eyes and hair. Photos on profile. I am no Tom Hardy or Chris Hemsworth but I will keep you smiling and laughing. I am based in Essex, often in London. 

I enjoy all the cliches like travel, food and drink and have a whole host of other interests and hobbies which I would love to share with you. Always interested in learning about you and your interests, happy to dance in the kitchen, and of course all the seasonal activities like trawling garden centres for the best Christmas ornaments for our grotto.

What I‚Äôm Looking For:

Someone with a sparkling personality and a good sense of humor who won‚Äôt mind if I occasionally narrate our lives like we‚Äôre in a rom-com.

I don‚Äôt tend to have a type, open minded as long you‚Äôre kind and interesting. The rest of the Christmas magic we can make together. 

Oh and can either appreciate or grin and bear cheesy one-liners like, ‚ÄúYou light up my life more than these Christmas lights.‚Äù

Bonus Points If You
Can decorate a gingerbread house better than I can (not hard, honestly). I want to do all the sickly cute festivities with you. 

Enjoy playful banter and don‚Äôt mind when I lose our arguments on purpose üëÄ 

Are open to fabricating some crazy weird story about how we really met. We can brainstorm this over lunch?

If this sounds like your kind of plotline, let‚Äôs make it happen. Slide into my DM‚Äôs and let‚Äôs start writing the script to our own happily-ever-after. (Snow machine and dramatic music NOT optional.)

I am located in Essex, regularly in London. Ideally you‚Äôd be near but I am open to something a bit further away if we get along and you‚Äôd be happy to close the distance in future. 
Realistically probably someone +5/-5 years in either direction of my age (I am 30) but I am open if the connection is there.

1h0ns8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1h0ns8h/why_cant_i_eat_normally_without_gaining_weight/,Why can‚Äôt I eat normally without gaining weight?,"
First, I want to acknowledge that I know my issue isn‚Äôt life-threatening and might seem stupid to some but it has deeply affected me mentally for a long time now. 

I (22F, currently 188lbs, 5‚Äò4‚Äú) have struggled with weight ever since childhood. I was a chubby kid that loved sweets and hated food. Getting me to eat properly was a challenge, but my family valued a healthy diet and persisted. As I grew older, I noticed people treated me differently because of my weight and slowly I became aware of beauty standarts, which led me to the conclusion that I need to loose weight at the age of 12. 
Ever since then I worked extremely hard. Until I was 18 or 19 I‚Äòve tried every diet in the book. Keto/low carb, intermittend fasting, low fat, high protein - anything you can think of. I went through phases of home workouts, gym sessions and running 30-60 minutes every other day. I learned how to track calories and macros, what is healthy and what is not.
I did loose weight and at one point I could have been considered skinny, but I never looked ,conventionally thin‚Äò even if I starved myself. There was always a stubborn layer of fat that made me look heavier that I couldn‚Äòt get rid of. That‚Äôs why I always thought of myself as weak and criticized my self for not working hard enough.

At 18, I was prescribed two antidepressants, Sertraline and Trazodone. Around the same time, I gained weight rapidly, going from 140 lbs to 175 lbs in about a year. I was exercising consistently and hadn‚Äôt changed my diet, but I did experience more cravings. I figured the medication caused all of that so i ignored it. At my heaviest, I saw a doctor for recurring weird stomach aches I‚Äòve had for a while and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (don‚Äôt ask me how these correlate the doctor was not taking me seriously) so they prescribed me Euthyrox. 
Nothing worked and after a while I just felt hopeless so I stopped taking all medications without consulting my doctors. (I know I shouldn‚Äòt do that)

About 3-6 months after stopping, I started losing weight rapidly and unintentionally. My appetite disappeared overnight and just thinking about food made me nauseous. I myself was confused why. The only thing I was consuming regularly was coffee and about one meal in a day or two. That led to a 45lbs weightloss in a year, leaving me just under 130lbs after two years. Neither the nausea nor the weight loss was intentional, yet I eventually accepted it and felt happy. But it is important to highlight that after two years of not even eating anything for most of the days I never looked starved or anorexic, even my therapist pointed that out to be weird. 

Two years later, I entered a relationship and began eating one regular meal a day, which I guess is what caused me to gain weight again. In the matter of a year I gained all the weight back by eating one normal sized meal a day. This left me extremely frustrated. Over the past two years, I‚Äôve tried everything to lose the weight again, but instead of losin I‚Äôve gained even more, reaching almost 190 lbs. I struggle with cravings again and feel like nothing works, despite eating healthy and dieting.  
I know that regaining lost weight due to a calorie increase is a common problem but I don‚Äôt think that it lasts for 2 years and any attempts of dieting, lowering calorie intake and switching to healthy food only fails. 

This has been incredibly depressing so I decided to find out if there are any medical causes to my problems. My gynecologist ruled out PCOS and my general doctor only discovered my thyroid was slightly slow (but ruled out hypothyroidism or hashimoto) and low iron levels. I was prescribed Euthyrox again (thought I told him it didn‚Äòt help me the first time) and started taking iron supplements.   
Recently, I saw a gastroenterologist for my ongoing stomach aches and mentioned weight issues. Among other things, he found I‚Äôm very insulin-resistant and prescribed 500mg of Metformin. However, I don‚Äôt feel any improvement yet and I‚Äôm losing hope, feeling like I‚Äôm wasting time.  

I‚Äôm tired of people suggesting I eat less or eat more, eat smaller portions or go to the gym or try yet another diet - I‚Äôve done all of that at some point. Right now, I‚Äôm doing everything ‚Äúright‚Äù except for not working out regularly and occasional cravings (which I now know are linked to insulin resistance).  

I just want to be able eat 2-3 healthy meals a day and maintain a healthy weight like a normal person. But that has never been the case for me. I feel like I have to completely  stop eating to start or maintain weight loss. I‚Äôm exhausted from constantly thinking about food and what or when I can or can‚Äôt eat to avoid gaining weight.

Could there be an underlying problem causing these weight fluctuations and difficulty losing weight? Something genetic? Some metabolic difficulties? Or am I just delusional and really not trying hard enough?",1,1732657605.0,AskDocs,1,0.67,False

1h0nqlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMagnusArchives/comments/1h0nqlx/tma_theory_the_webs_earlier_experiments_in_a_mass/,"TMA Theory - The Web's earlier experiments in a mass ritual: Gertrude, Agnes, and Fielding","I'm new to TMA (listened to all 200 episodes over the last week and a half), so forgive me if I'm reiterating a previously-circulated theory. Though, I have searched through the Reddit archives and haven't found an exactly similar one.

The theory is, basically, that the Web has been trying for a while to figure out how to bring the fears through through a multi-fear ritual and that binding Agnes and Gertrude was an early attempt, the failure of which led the Web to realize that its goals would be best achieved not by binding itself to other avatars, including its opposite the Desolation, but by cultivating an avatar of the Eye that was not bound, but marked by the other fears.

I've seen it reiterated across the sub that it was only realized (or confirmed) by Gertrude with the failure of the Dark's ritual that the fears would have to come through all together. However, we know that the Eye is an ignorant power, one that has the capacity to know a great many facts, but that is incapable of understanding their interrelation and of formulating any hypothetical postulates about them. So, I think it's more likely that when Gertrude comes to the revelation that the rituals will fail if prepared by any power acting alone, it's because the Web, which has figured that much out long before, has decided that it benefits its plan for the Eye to also know that fact. So, it lays the groundwork for the right coincidences to take place for Gertrude to come to her 'discovery.'

I think that this interpretation is supported by the fact that long before the successful Mass Ritual (a.k.a. the Magnus Archives), which is the Eye's first attempt at a ritual following Gertrude's discovery, the other fears had already begun experimenting in rituals that combined their powers in various configurations.

We're told that sometimes two powers have allied themselves in effecting a ritual. These, of course, fail, just as had the rituals attempted by a power acting alone. In the wake of these failures, the Web continued experimenting in ways that powers might be effectively combined for the purpose of effecting a successful ritual.

I think that the Web's binding of Agnes, Gertrude, and itself might be one such example. Agnes was chosen/created from birth to be the Desolation's most powerful avatar; if any avatar could bring through the desolation's ritual, without being tainted by the qualities of other powers, it ought to have been her. She was sent to Fielding's home at Hill Top Road from childhood, where she was not only impacted by being in the spider's den, but where she somehow became bound to Fielding, keeping his hand, which remained alive and on her person until her own death. She was also bound by the Web to Gertrude, who was both the Archivist and, we are told, a very Lonely person, and we see the effects on Agnes's character soon after: she soon begins going to cafes to sit alone with her coffee, and she reciprocates the interests of the first (human) man to give her attention. This compromises her ability to go through with the Desolation ritual, sowing doubt in her.

Yet her inability to go through with the ritual, and indeed to keep living, is also, we are told, caused by the felling of the HTR tree. This tree is, I think, that which bound her to Fielding. Throughout TMA, we see that 'binding' works through some object--most often pages/books. This tree, in the backyard of the HTR house, is spider-like, has been singed with fire, and has the web-box with a spidery apple at its base. Shortly after it falls down, both Agnes and Fielding's hand die. I think it's safe to conclude that it's the object binding Agnes and Fielding/the Web. (Given that it bleeds, perhaps it's Fielding, whose body was never found, himself?)

The woodland circle that binds Gertrude and Agnes is disturbed without either of their deaths (perhaps because their death was not a part of the binding, as Fielding's seems to have been in his own), but it nonetheless ruins the Web's plan to bind Agnes to the other powers, showing the risks associated with binding beyond just the personality changes that render Agnes (and would render other avatars) unable to carry out a ritual that would bring the other powers through with it.

So, it then elects the Eye as the fear to bring through all Fear and allows Gertrude to come to the 'realization' that rituals fail in seclusion so that Elias/Jonah knows how next to 'plot'.

This time, rather than alliances and rather than binding, it turns to 'marking' as a way to get one avatar, the Archivist, to gain the capacity to bring through all of the fears. This technique is preferable because it doesn't bring with it any risk associated with external artifacts (books or trees) that might be destroyed while the other pieces are still being brought into place.

To counter a possible objection, it doesn't really matter that the Web already marked Sims by the time that it began advancing this approach 'in earnest'. As Annabelle tells us, through Martin, the Web is flexible, it plans for contingencies and once one path of action is no longer feasible, it switches to another.

Because of this, I think it's possible that the Unknowing might *also* be considered an attempt to implicate multiple/all powers in a single ritual. We know that Nikola decided to use the skins of two Eye avatars, Gertrude and Jurgen, is it not possible that there were artifacts/remnants of other Fears in use? If so, then its failure is again just another failed experiment in the Web's relentless pursuit of the ritual that would succeed.

  
\[Edit: one piece that I don't know what to do with, however, is the idea that felling the HTR tree helped to widen the gap beneath the house... is it related to the fact that in Anya's world, the tree is still there, whereas in that of the Archives, it's already felled? so the gap might be the discrepancies between worlds? If the gap *must* have been widened in this way for Fear's escape to be possible, then perhaps it was the intended consequence of binding Agnes and Fielding? or, perhaps the widening of the gap was an unintended but fortuitous result?\]",1,1732657491.0,TheMagnusArchives,0,1.0,False

Dear papa,

It‚Äôs been a very long journey. I sometimes wonder if it could‚Äôve been shorter but I took your advice and took the train to France anyway. It was a very long ride but the books you gave me kept me entertained until I fell asleep. 

France was really beautiful, I wish I was able to spend more time there. I got to try Parisian hot chocolate and croissants! Their sweets are top tier! It‚Äôs a shame I only spent a single day there before finally meeting my mentor. We met in a secret hotel and had tea and coffee before heading to the airport. 

My mentor is a very eccentric man, but he has an ability, just like me! His ability is a bit more scary though, he can see the dead! And you thought my ability to see the past was scary! But please don‚Äôt worry, he seems intimidating but he‚Äôs nice to me sometimes. He compliments me when I do well and tells me how I can improve. I can tell that he really loves this work and just wants me to take it as seriously as he does. 

The plane ride to Taiwan was very long but not as long as the sleeper train. I took your advice of drinking lots of water and staring ahead during the flight and I didn‚Äôt throw up! I‚Äôm so happy! I would‚Äôve been really embarrassed if I threw up on the flight to my first serious case! 

But papa, this job is serious business! We had to take the plane while dressing like uncle and niece to avoid suspicion! We even use fake names when going out! I was nervous to send this letter at first but my mentor said it‚Äôs okay as long as I don‚Äôt write anything ‚Äútoo identifying.‚Äù 

Taiwan is really nice. I like to explore whenever I'm free. The nights here are especially beautiful because there‚Äôs so many lights and the food is very delicious! The people are also very nice too. We‚Äôre in a small city that‚Äôs far away from the main ones so me and my mentor stick out like sore thumbs, being the only foreigners and all. They don‚Äôt discriminate against us though, they know we‚Äôre here to help their city. The other day I got free boba tea from the stand I always go to! 

‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm a little scared sometimes, papa. I know I signed up for this and you warned me about it but it‚Äôs still scary actually being away from home and solving cases like this. I‚Äôve seen so much and it hasn‚Äôt been a month. I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt be going home anytime soon, there‚Äôs still so much to unpack and unravel and every time we think we‚Äôre getting closer, another thing happens. It feels like someone is distracting us from finding out the truth. It‚Äôs scary, I sometimes feel like someone is after me. The secrecy we‚Äôre bound to also doesn‚Äôt make things feel better. 

It‚Äôs rewarding to find the truth, it really is but the journey there is still scary. I love solving cases and giving people peace and relief, I love that feeling of getting one step closer to what we came here for and I love learning about the place and its people, but the target on my back feels so apparent that I sometimes find myself unable to sleep. I want to talk more to my mentor but he tells me that worry and doubt will only hold me back as a detective.

I think he holds himself back a lot, he doesn‚Äôt cry. He‚Äôs respectful to victims and he‚Äôs taught me so much but I feel like he‚Äôs carrying a lot sometimes and I don‚Äôt want him to carry my burden too. 

My head still hurts when I try to use my ability, I say I‚Äôll have better control of it by the end of this case but it feels like I‚Äôm still stuck at square one. The medicine that Babushka made helps me but I always feel like I‚Äôm holding everyone back when I can‚Äôt tell them immediately what I saw. My mentor tells me it‚Äôs okay and to take my time but I feel guilty. I really hope I can have better control of it. 

Everything is a lot but I‚Äôll continue trying my best regardless. 

‚Ä¶

Pray for me, okay papa? 

With love,
Tvoy Zaya

Am I missing something?,"I met a man on Facebook Dating in April. We dated a bit, hung out doing fun stuff. Got along great and commented often how nice it was and how easy it was to be around each other. 

He had prostate surgery late September and I stayed with him for what was supposed to be a couple nights to care for him but ended up being almost nightly for two months because he asked me to stay. 

Weekend before this past, he was given the green light to resume sexual activity. The first time was quick and no foreplay, I was fine with that because he was mostly just nervous if things would work or not. But after that, he attempted again but I wasn't ""ready"" and he tried to continued without attending to my preparedness. I was not about to let this become habit so I shut it down that morning. Regretably, because when it comes to intimacy, I love it and have never been ""not ready"" and I very VERY rarely no. The next evening I gave him the back rub and tickling he likes until I felt it was my turn. He didn't turn over so I thought he'd gone to sleep and I too, fell asleep. When I woke, I was upset and left the room. He asked the next morning what happened and when I said I wanted to discuss it, he said ""Wait, I need coffee."" No problem. But then he got a call, then we had to leave and worked outdoors all day ... when we were finished and heading home, I told him I was going to head to my house. He knew somehing was up but didn't inquire. 

I went home, left him to his football that afternoon and evening. I was swamped Monday and never got time to reach out and then Monday night football meant I still didn't want to start a conversation that would preoccupy the little downtime he has to enjoy. 

I called Tuesday and left a message along the lines of ""see you this evening, maybe Taco Tuesday?"" and hoped we'd be able to talk about things and settle the matter. He never responded. Later that evening I texted him to please let me know everything was ok. No response. Wednesday called, no answer so I texted a message, a bit upset that he wasn't returning my call and I was now worried. Nothing. 

Thursday I drove there and he wasn't home. I sent a text letting him know I had stopped and that I'd spent two months nursing him and diligently making sure he was taken care of, comfortable, etc. and that I'd done it with no expectations and asked for very little so now I was asking for him to afford me the time to explain what was going on. He responded he was ""So sorry about all this. I am stressed out watching grandchildren after school every other day, helping his stepmom, and dealing with a daughter just commencing her second divorce and he needed time."" 

I felt that was crap and regardless. that he'd ghosted me at all I was no longer interested in maintaining anything but a friendship with him. I replied that I understood, felt we were better off maintaining just a friendship, that I had things at his house I needed and when could we talk and tie up loose ends. No response. 

We were to have Friendsgiving Sunday and he paid for the food so after I hosted Friendsgiving (I did not mention it or pressure him about joining, just went on without him), I brought him leftovers. I didn't blindside him and knock, I just left the items and texted that I'd left them. He sent a thank you text. The next day I told him I would be close to him tomorrow and could he afford us the time to talk and I pick up my things. No response. 

So today I sent a calm request that he gather my things (I listed them) and ""anything else that is mine that might remind you I ever existed."" He replied ""I am so sorry about all this."" 

I just don't understand punishing me without warning or real explanation when I would be the only person taking care of him or making sure his needs were met. I feel as though he's not being honest. Either he wasn't that in to me; or someone new (or old) suddenly popped into the picture. I am not responding. I have nothing left to say. Sorry means nothing in a text expecially when I've already let him off the hook! Am I overthinking? Does anyone have any other thoughts on this? 

At this point, I am not interested in more than having the truth face to face and saying goodbye but I really do want that.  Face to face.  Thank you in advance.",1,1732656955.0,AskMenAdvice,5,1.0,False

Il se compose de plusieurs creÃÅations dont l‚Äôassemblage va permettre le deÃÅveloppement d‚Äôune histoire extraordinaire :

note : j'√©cris √ßa de t√™te, mais je pense que c'est ce qu'il s'est pass√©

a. Je re√ßois un message depuis la plateforme mymajorcompany qui indique que les backers au plus haut niveau doivent envoyer des photos d'eux pour l'int√©gration. Ce que je fais

b. je re√ßois plus tard un message un peu catastroph√© qui indique que le message a √©t√© envoy√© √† TOUS les backers pour envoi de leur photo et pas que les backers de plus haut niveau. Je r√©ponds donc √† ce message, sans r√©ponse.

c. toujours pas de nouvelle, j'attends donc la sortie de la fameuse vid√©o, r√©sign√© (je ne sais plus dire √† ce moment si je les relance, ou pas, ou combien de fois)

C'est ce jour o√π je me d√©sabonne de lui et autres trucs food machin et que je me promets de toujours chier sur la gueule de Fran√ßois Theurel.

J'ai cru comprendre qu'il n'avait pas forc√©ment le cul propre : accusations de violences conjugales - je ne sais pas si elles sont fond√©es - ou autre comportement de princesse (ce qui semble corroborer avec mon exp√©rience lol).

Si vous avez des √©l√©ments, je suis en tous cas preneur !

Am I missing something?,"# I met a man on Facebook Dating in April.  We dated a bit, hung out doing fun stuff.  Got along great and commented often how nice it was and how easy it was to be around each other. He had prostate surgery late September and I stayed with him for what was supposed to be a couple nights to care for him but ended up being almost nightly for two months because he asked me to stay. Weekend before this past, he was given the green light to resume sexual activity. The first time was quick and no foreplay, I was fine with that because he was mostly just nervous if things would work or not. But after that, he attempted again but I wasn't ""ready"" and he tried to continued without attending to my preparedness. I was not about to let this become habit so I shut it down that morning. Regretably, because when it comes to intimacy, I love it and have never been ""not ready"" and I very VERY rarely no. The next evening I gave him the back rub and tickling he likes until I felt it was my turn. He didn't turn over so I thought he'd gone to sleep and I too, fell asleep. When I woke, I was upset and left the room. He asked the next morning what happened and when I said I wanted to discuss it, he said ""Wait, I need coffee."" No problem. But then he got a call, then we had to leave and worked outdoors all day ... when we were finished and heading home, I told him I was going to head to my house. He knew somehing was up but didn't inquire. I went home, left him to his football that afternoon and evening. I was swamped Monday and never got time to reach out and then Monday night football meant I still didn't want to start a conversation that would preoccupy the little downtime he has to enjoy. I called Tuesday and left a message along the lines of ""see you this evening, maybe Taco Tuesday?"" and hoped we'd be able to talk about things and settle the matter. He never responded. Later that evening I texted him to please let me know everything was ok. No response. Wednesday called, no answer so I texted a message, a bit upset that he wasn't returning my call and I was now worried. Nothing. Thursday I drove there and he wasn't home. I sent a text letting him know I had stopped and that I'd spent two months nursing him and diligently making sure he was taken care of, comfortable, etc. and that I'd done it with no expectations and asked for very little so now I was asking for him to afford me the time to explain what was going on. He responded he was ""So sorry about all this. I am stressed out watching grandchildren after school every other day, helping his stepmom, and dealing with a daughter just commencing her second divorce and he needed time."" I felt that was crap and regardless. that he'd ghosted me at all I was no longer interested in maintaining anything but a friendship with him. I replied that I understood, felt we were better off maintaining just a friendship, that I had things at his house I needed and when could we talk and tie up loose ends. No response. We were to have Friendsgiving Sunday and he paid for the food so after I hosted Friendsgiving (I did not mention it or pressure him about joining, just went on without him), I brought him leftovers.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

But, the neurovascular surgeon seemed to be very much a CYA kinda guy since in his after visit note, wrote something like ‚Äúprovided patient with no gurantees‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt give my much info at all‚Ä¶ he said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell the future‚Äù which is fair but jeez I need something to go on here!

Also his nurse practitioner said that if he really really didn‚Äôt think I should go on the vacation he probably would have put his foot down about it.

I guess I‚Äôm wondering about the safety of flying in a plane specifically. I made sure where I was traveling hospitals would be nearby (mostly)

For context I have normal blood pressure if not a tad low. I also stopped drinking coffee and alcohol although I never drank either excessively.

I‚Äôm having angiogram right when I get back from vacation December 9th. Then an endonasal procedure the next day to decompress the tumor. After I heal from that, then they would want to treat the aneurysm.",1,1732656464.0,BrainAneurysm,1,1.0,False
1h0nbia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h0nbia,"Anderston Commercial Centre, Glasgow [OC]","40 years ago, I spent a summer working at the old Anderston Bus Station, buried below the concrete decks and towers of what was intended as one of the first stages of a massive redevelopment of the west end of the city centre. The plans were for a substantial area of ‚Äúpeople in the air‚Äù structures connected by walkways, not unlike that incorporated into the Barbican in London.

Designed by Richard Seifert and completed in 1972, the complex included high-rise residential blocks, multiple striking low-rise commercial blocks and a commercial centre atop and around a big bus station. There was a curious octagonal part but I can‚Äôt remember what was in it. 

Back in the 1980s, the area remained rather run down, but still a great place to work. The staff of several Scottish Bus Group companies played push and shove with the staff of Stagecoach (including Brian Souter himself) trying - unsuccessfully - to stop his buses using the bus station bays.

Today, the bus station has long gone (as has the Scottish Bus Goup) and despite considerable investment in facades, planters and ‚ÄúDo not feed the birds‚Äù signs, the public has still not taken to this site. It crosses three entire blocks between Blythswood and Oak Streets. Much has now been demolished and only remnants remain, marketed as Cadogan Square.

The former site of the bus station is easily recognisable by the buildings on concrete stilts alongside Argyle Street but there is no longer a transport hub on the west side of Glasgow. Nor is there a big mall, with retail gathered east of Central Station on the site of another former transport hub.

Once a delightfully seedy and raucous part of Glasgow, the old Anderston area is now home to banks, hedge funds and their support: upmarket coffee shops and chain hotels.",28,1732656432.0,brutalism,1,0.97,False

I've never even been out to a meal with them in my 22 years of life. 

For some context my mum is a stay at home mum (which she chooses to be despite having opportunities to evolve, knowing English and being capable to work). She has always been a stay at home mum she's never had a job despite being raised in the UK from a young age. Me and my siblings are all grown now my 2 younger siblings are in high school. There's no need for her to be a stay at home mum anymore. Since she's home a lot she wakes up when she wants which is usually after 11am/12pm depending on whether she needs to do something. 

My dad has always worked on and off recently because of his health issues / mental illness. His shift pattern is around 4pm - 11pm. So majority of the time he will sleep until it's time for him to go to work. 

Because of this I was raised to believe that waking up before 12pm was abnormal unless it was for something in particular such as school. As I grew older I started to realise that this wasn't strange and waking up early without there having to be a reason such as school or work is not abnormal. It's okay to wake up early if you don't have something on. 

Whenever I had plans with friends which required me to wake up early I would get shouted at saying 'I woke up everyone in the house' which is untrue because I would be as silent as possible to the point where I wouldn't even switch on the lights I would use my phone torch. I would also be shouted as and told off because I apparently 'can wake up early for friends' 'do everything my friends say' 'would never wake up early if they asked'. All of which are untrue because if they ever needed me to wake up early I would. 

It's not just waking up early it's also going out late. It's like forbidden to be out later than 5/6pm unless it's themselves?? My AM will blow up my phone if it's even a few minutes past 5pm asking where I am why am I late. If I have something at 4pm it's easier for me to leave the house at 9am and wait around in a coffee shop all day than leave the house at 3pm because to her that time is too late to leave the house and ""what's the need to leave so late"". They put a time limit of when you can leave the house which genuinely made me think it was crazy to leave the house after a certain time. 

Even when I have a valid reason to go out early or come home late they are constantly questioning. For example, I used to work as a carer some of my shifts were early morning starts eg 7:30am. Whenever I had a early morning shift even if I told them the day before, the morning of my shift they would go off asking where I'm going so early, ""what kind of job starts at 7:30am"" ""this isn't normal"" and then start accusing me of doing all sorts. Why would I wake up early morning willingly to do no good??. Because of this I had to ask my manager to stop putting me on early shifts so she would put me on late shifts till 10pm. This also caused issues ""why do you finish so late"" ""this doesn't make sense who finishes work so late what kind of job is that"". Like I could never win it was exhausting. 

When I worked in retail I remember I had to tell my manager I couldn't do shifts till 7pm because my mum wouldn't allow it. I didn't realise that wasn't a normal thing to say as a 19 year old and the look my manager (a white man) gave me made me feel so embarrassed. I tried explaining to my mum that I can't pick and choose my shifts it's not up to me but she always says 'just tell them you can't do it' 'just don't go then'. Like what?? This isn't how a job works but since she's never had a job she'd never know. She doesn't understand I can't just do things because I feel like it. 

Furthermore, my parents never do any sort of activity. We've never been out to a restaurant. We've never been on holiday. We've never been to the cinema together. We've never done anything because it's all seen as a 'waste of money' and apparently spending money on those things would affect the possibility of us buying a house. This makes no sense to me because how is a ¬£50 meal or ¬£300 holiday once in a blue moon going to impact savings towards a house??. Since they never did any of this stuff I also never was able to experience it till I got older and my friends really allowed me to experience things. I never even explored my own city till I was fully grown in university.

1h0n29g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Electronic-Equal-280/comments/1h0n29g/the_small_business_owners_cheat_sheet_25_ai_terms/,The Small Business Owner's Cheat Sheet: 25 AI Terms You Need to Know,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer the exclusive domain of tech giants. It‚Äôs changing the way businesses of all sizes operate, and small business owners are in a prime position to benefit from it. AI can simplify operations, improve customer service, and provide data-driven insights that level the playing field. But with so many buzzwords and jargon, it can feel overwhelming to know where to start. This cheat sheet breaks down 25 essential AI terms in clear, practical language, complete with examples of how small businesses can put them to use.

**1. What is Artificial Intelligence? A Clear Starting Point**

At its core, AI refers to computer systems designed to mimic human thinking and decision-making. These systems can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or recommendations.

**Real-world example:**  
A local coffee shop uses an AI tool to track customer purchases and recommend daily specials based on buying habits.

Why it matters: AI allows small businesses to automate tasks, reduce human error, and make smarter decisions with data.

**2. Machine Learning and Deep Learning: What‚Äôs the Difference?**

**Machine Learning (ML):**¬†A subset of AI where algorithms learn from data to improve performance over time. Think of it as teaching a program to get better the more it‚Äôs used.

**Deep Learning (DL):**¬†A more advanced form of ML that uses neural networks to analyze large amounts of unstructured data, such as images or audio.

**Practical application:**  
A florist predicts flower demand for Valentine‚Äôs Day using ML, while a boutique clothing store uses DL to identify seasonal trends from social media photos.

**3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Making Sense of Human Language**

NLP enables AI to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It‚Äôs the technology behind chatbots, virtual assistants, and translation tools.

**Example:**  
A small accounting firm integrates an AI chatbot on their website to answer client questions about tax deadlines and deductions, freeing up staff for more complex queries.

**4. Computer Vision: Teaching Machines to See**

Computer vision allows AI to process and analyze visual information like images or videos.

**Real-life use case:**  
Retail stores use computer vision for inventory management, scanning shelves to identify when stock is running low.

Emerging trend: The rise of facial recognition for personalized shopping experiences or security purposes.

**5. Automation: Streamlining Everyday Tasks**

Automation refers to the use of AI to handle repetitive or time-consuming activities without human intervention.

**Examples for small businesses:**

* Email marketing platforms that send personalized follow-ups to customers.
* Appointment scheduling systems that automatically confirm bookings and send reminders.

**Real-life story:**  
A small bakery saves hours each week by automating online orders and delivery schedules.

**6. Big Data: What It Means for Small Businesses**

Big data refers to large, complex datasets that are analyzed for patterns, trends, and insights. While it might sound like something only big corporations deal with, even small businesses generate data from sales, customer interactions, and website traffic.

**Example:**  
A yoga studio uses data from class bookings to identify peak times and offer more classes when demand is highest.

Affordable tools like Google Analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms make it easier than ever to tap into big data insights.

**7. AI Ethics: Why It Matters**

AI ethics focuses on responsible usage, ensuring fairness, transparency, and data privacy.

**Why it matters to small businesses:**  
If you‚Äôre using AI to collect customer data or make decisions, you must ensure compliance with laws like GDPR or CCPA.

**A Real-world example scenario:**  
**The Boutique of Trust**

Sophie McDermott owns a small online boutique known for unique, handcrafted fashion. Her designs were a hit, but with so many competitors in the online marketplace, she struggled to keep customers coming back. After months of research, Sophie decided to integrate an AI-driven recommendation system into her website.

The system promised to analyze customer preferences, past purchases, and browsing habits to suggest products tailored to each shopper. Sophie was excited but also nervous. She‚Äôd heard stories of businesses losing customer trust over unclear data practices. Determined to do things differently, she developed a transparent approach.

On the day the AI system launched, Sophie introduced it with a personal message on her website:

*""We‚Äôre using AI to make your shopping experience better. Here‚Äôs how it works: Our system looks at your past purchases and what you‚Äôve browsed to suggest items you might love. Your data is safe with us‚Äîwe never share or sell it. You can view or delete your preferences anytime through your account settings. We want you to feel confident shopping with us.""*

To make things even clearer, Sophie included a short FAQ about the system, explaining what data was collected, why it was used, and how customers could opt out. She also promised not to recommend products to customers who chose not to share their preferences.

The results were immediate. Customers loved the thoughtful approach.

Over time, Sophie noticed more repeat customers and positive reviews mentioning the system. Her boutique became known not just for its stylish items but for its honesty and respect for customer privacy.

**8. Generative AI: Creativity Meets Business Goals**

Generative AI creates original content like text, images, videos, or music based on a simple input.

**Example for small businesses:**  
A marketing agency uses AI tools like ChatGPT to generate blog posts and DALL¬∑E to create visually striking ad campaigns.

Generative AI saves time and boosts creativity, making professional-quality content accessible to even the smallest teams.

**9. AI in Marketing: Smarter Strategies for Growth**

AI-powered marketing tools help small businesses improve personalization, automate campaigns, and track results.

**Key tools:**

* Platforms like Mailchimp recommend email subject lines based on past performance.
* Social media management tools schedule posts and analyze engagement data for better targeting.

**Small business success story:**  
A local pet store uses AI to target Facebook ads based on customer behavior, resulting in a 20% increase in online sales.

**10. Predictive Analytics: Planning Ahead**

Predictive analytics uses historical data to forecast future events or trends.

**Example:**  
A small winery predicts wine preferences for new customers based on purchase patterns.

By adopting predictive tools, businesses can make informed decisions about inventory, marketing, and resource allocation.

**11‚Äì25. Glossary of Key AI Terms**

Here‚Äôs a quick reference to other important AI-related terms and what they mean:

* **Algorithm:**¬†The step-by-step instructions that power AI systems.
* **Neural Networks:**¬†AI systems modeled after the human brain, used for tasks like image recognition.
* **Chatbots:**¬†Virtual assistants that answer customer queries in real time.
* **Sentiment Analysis:**¬†Tools that evaluate customer feedback to determine positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.
* **Cloud AI:**¬†AI tools hosted on cloud servers for easy access and scalability.
* **Edge Computing:**¬†Processing data locally on devices, which reduces latency.
* **IoT (Internet of Things):**¬†Connecting devices to collect and share data, such as smart thermostats or inventory trackers.
* **Reinforcement Learning:**¬†AI learns by trial and error to optimize outcomes, often used in robotics or gaming.
* **Speech Recognition:**¬†AI that transcribes spoken words into text, like virtual assistants.
* **Augmented Reality (AR):**¬†Combining digital overlays with the physical world, useful for retail or real estate.

**Making AI Work for You**

AI offers small businesses unprecedented opportunities to save time, cut costs, and grow. By understanding these 25 terms, you‚Äôre better equipped to evaluate tools and strategies that fit your goals.

Try incorporating just one AI tool‚Äîlike a chatbot or predictive analytics platform‚Äîand see how it transforms your business. The future isn‚Äôt just for tech giants; it‚Äôs for every small business owner willing to embrace the advantages AI brings.

We were a small agency, 3-4 dispatchers on shift with a small shift of cops and fire/ems. Our county was so uneventful that on most shifts we watched movies (took 6 hours to watch a movie when pausing for traffic, though), played board games, and one night we even turned off the lights and had a karaoke party.

It wasn't unusual for the cops or fire/ems to come to the center and bring all of us coffee or donuts, or even leftover cake from a wedding at the town recreation hall. They'd hang out and tell us all the gossip, genuinely cared about us.

I miss the guys who got high on mushrooms in November and got lost in the national forest (that was a 6 hour call). I miss Jake pranking me running names and DOBs from a cemetery. I miss Allie calling up at 7 a.m. and telling me I was too damn perky for that early in the morning. I don't miss the cop who said he'd never protect me, after I had to write him up.  I don't miss the call that made me leave. SIDS call, tried my best, can't get the dad's voice out of my head even these many years later. 

I miss feeling like I was helping people.

I've been a barista for over 6 years, and I get this question all the time - especially from people who are just getting into the world of home brewing. Let me break down everything you need to know about K-cup compatible coffee makers.

First off, while Keurig is the original creator of K-cups, they're not the only brand that makes machines that can use them. I've tested dozens of coffee makers, and there's actually quite a variety out there.

The most obvious choice is any Keurig machine. I personally use the Keurig K-Elite at home (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine), and it's been super reliable. But there are other brands too, like Hamilton Beach and Mueller, that make K-cup compatible brewers.

Here's what you should know about K-cup compatibility:

1. Original Keurig Machines:
- K-Elite
- K-Classic
- K-Mini
- K-Supreme
- K-Cafe

2. Non-Keurig Alternatives:
- Hamilton Beach FlexBrew
- Mueller Single Serve
- Chefman InstaCoffee

Something I learned the hard way: not all pod-style coffee makers take K-cups. Nespresso machines, for example, use totally different pods. Also, some cheaper knock-off brands might say they're ""pod compatible"" but don't work well with K-cups.

If you're in the market for a new coffee maker, I'd recommend checking out this collection of K-cup compatible machines: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. I've found some great deals there, and they're all genuine products that work with K-cups.

Pro tip: Whatever machine you choose, make sure to clean it regularly. I run a vinegar solution through mine once a month, and it keeps everything working perfectly.

Most modern K-cup machines also work with reusable pods, which is great if you want to use your own ground coffee or care about environmental impact. I actually switch between regular K-cups and a reusable pod depending on how much time I have in the morning.

One last thing - while there are some really cheap options out there, I've found that investing in a quality machine pays off in the long run. The cheaper ones tend to break down faster and often don't brew at the right temperature for optimal flavor.

So there you have it! Hope this helps you find the right coffee maker for your needs. Feel free to ask any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee enthusiasts!",1,1732655043.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Our roommate and I were friends beforehand and I'd known him longer than I had known my husband. We signed onto the lease together to get a cheaper rent with more space. He's... fine. The usual issues that get under our skin but to be expected. HOWEVER... whenever my husband and I go away he effing trashes the house and it is so infuriating.

  
My husband and I went on a 10day vacation, before we left, I mopped the floors, scrubbed the walls, I wanted to come back to a nice clean home. We deep cleaned the kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms and living space. 10 days later, we got in at midnight and I literally gagged from an entire loaf of moldy bread open and green sitting on the counter and spoiled milk in bowls in the sink. The fridge had nasty 7-days past due raw meat (which he bought despite maybe cooking 5 meals in the last like 4 years)--the smell of which literally affected the flavour of the open juices in the fridge, the floors were muddy with muddy shoe prints (we don't wear shoes in the house). The garbage, hadn't gone out on garbage day and even though we have separate garbage for food items-- food was put into the main garbage so it smells to high heaven. Our living room smells like weed... our roommate never smokes in the house when we are here. There are muddy paw prints on our couch (which I had shampooed just before we left)-- we don't have pets but he watched a friend's dog while we were away which I knew about and was okay with-- assuming he would, you know, tidy up after. He left take out bags on our light coloured rug (including a partially finished coffee which leaked through the bottom of the cup and stained my rug).  So... I've been cleaning all day... and he doesn't get why I'm upset and keeps saying it isn't that bad.

  
I am so angry that I am shaking and I am not a confrontational person ever.

  
When I commented on the fact that he did literally no chores and made everything messy after he had watched me clean for multiple days before leaving so that everything would be clean when I got back-- he literally was like 'well you didn't tell me to do it'... WTF, I'm not his mother, he should know how to not be a disgusting pig.

  
Oh and he ate all our candy in the pantry - \_-.

My attempt at searching here failed dismally - do you have or have you seen any good examples of terrain pieces that can store sets of clan rats vertically?

I was musing on something polystyrene based with little cutouts for the rats in the unrealistic idea that maybe some day I'd take them out somewhere and it could double as transport - which is probably overcomplicating things.  Polystyrene would lend itself more to some sort of stone edifice/ ruin which could work but also might be quite chunky.  Probably good for stacking / being modular if just going for a flat chunk with four chunky pillar-legs and looking like a carpark

I have seen people doing nice things (if not any rat storing pieces that I'm aiming at here) with coffee stirrers for planks and have done some smaller experiments with terrain using those, but I'm not sure how I'd go about getting 10 or ideally 20 rats on a level, especially if aiming at two or more levels above ground (shelf).

To top off the question of how it might look anywhere near nice, all my finished rats so far have sandy bases, which would look especially odd up on a building - although I do have 40 clan rats to paint so they could always get themselves something more 'up on a building' suitable around their feet.

So anyway, if there are any good examples I can ~~rip off~~ take inspiration from please I'd appreciate them. Or just ideas / suggestions (preferably about the rat stacking aim / solutions for it).",1,1732654963.0,skaven,0,1.0,False

**Grind Size**  
I‚Äôm using a dark roast, as fresh as I can get, and have set the internal burr to 3. However, anything below a grind setting of 8 chokes my machine ‚ÄîI only get a few drops out of the portafilter.

I‚Äôm using 18g of coffee and aiming for a 2:1 ratio in 25-30 seconds. At grind size 6, the machine chokes entirely, and at 7 or 8, the shots come out sour or bitter. Is it normal to be grinding this coarse and still choking the machine? Is it possible the 8 setting is just fine and I'm putting too much weight into the ""grind finer"" dogma?

**Extraction Time**  
The default auto-timing is way too short, so I‚Äôve been manually controlling shots. Is this the right approach of is it odd I need to manually extract vs. using the auto functions?

**Tools**  
I added a WDT, which helps, but I think tamping and levelling might be causing choking and channelling issues. Should I invest in a better tamper/distributor, or is it more about technique?

Just tell it about your meals for the day - it generally understands the date - but just to be sure I tell it what day it is at the start of the day: ""Good Morning it's Tuesday!""

You can even tell it about regular food items you eat - such as how you make your coffee (with cream) and what that Sushi Roll you like is made of.  It will remember, and all you have to say is, ""I had my coffee and a Saumari Roll for lunch.""  At the end of the day, I ask for a nutrition update.  I've also asked it to issue a yellow alert or red alert if it thinks I'm going to go over certain caloric thresholds.  It can also analyze the quality of items - I have it rate items as an A, B, C, D or F.  Broccoli gets an A.  

Ask for suggestions. It told me to cut down on the chocolate syrup in my homemade lattes‚Äîand I probably wouldn't notice the difference. It was right. It nags me to eat more veggies.  Tell it where you live and suggest a nearby restaurant that serves healthy and low-calorie food, including fast food. It will find it.  Tell it what food you don't like (nasty cilantro).  Ask for a weekly summary with the good and the bad.  Tell it your weight regularly.  

Do you buy an obscure item? Just upload a picture of the nutrition label and GPT will parse it and remember it.

But alas, the scrapping world has changed! Gone are the days when a man (or woman!) could simply rove the streets, pluck a rusty fridge from the curb, and ride triumphantly into the scrapyard sunset. Nay, today‚Äôs scrapper must not only work hard but work smart. Thus, I present to you the **Unified Field Theory of Modern Scrapping**: a revolutionary method, a daring philosophy, and a spiritual awakening wrapped in the guise of salvaging society‚Äôs cast-offs.

# Step 1: The Scrapping Zeitgeist‚ÄîEmbrace the Philosophy

First, one must understand the *why* before the *how*. Scrapping isn‚Äôt just about scavenging metal. It‚Äôs a movement. A way of life. A rebellion against wastefulness and a full-throated ""No thanks!"" to landfills. By taking up the sacred mantle of the scrapper, you are becoming a steward of Earth‚Äôs finite resources, a knight-errant of sustainability. Internalize this ethos, for scrapping is not merely a profession‚Äîit is a calling.

# Step 2: The Quantum Mechanics of Curbside Chaos

In the swirling quantum soup of curbside junk, where Schrodinger‚Äôs Microwave might contain both priceless copper coils and a family of wasps, you must adopt a mindset of quantum scrapping. This involves three principles:

1. **Observation Collapses Potential**: A pile of trash is just a pile‚Äîuntil you look closer. Study it with the gaze of an alchemist searching for gold. That rickety fan? Pure copper veins inside. That defunct treadmill? Steel glory. The universe rewards those who see the potential beyond the surface.
2. **Entanglement with Community**: Cultivate relationships with the garbage leavers‚Äîthe unsuspecting public. Neighborhood groups, online forums, and Craigslist ""curb alerts"" can all feed your scrapping empire. When people know you‚Äôre the local junk whisperer, you‚Äôll find items practically manifesting on your doorstep.
3. **The Uncertainty Principle of Bulk Days**: Scrapping success is never guaranteed, but you can maximize your odds by aligning with the cycles of trash collection. Map your city‚Äôs bulk trash days like a treasure hunter charting the stars.

# Step 3: The Darwinian Efficiency Model

Survival of the fittest applies to scrapping, too. The fittest scrapper is the one who wastes neither time nor fuel. Enter the **Scrapping Flow Optimization Matrix (SFOM)**:

* **Zone Mapping**: Divide your scrapping route into zones and prioritize areas rich in high-value neighborhoods (where the affluent toss out immaculate stainless-steel grills simply because ‚Äúthe new one has Wi-Fi‚Äù).
* **Load Maximization**: Learn the sacred art of the ""scrapper‚Äôs Tetris."" A poorly packed truck is the Achilles‚Äô heel of the amateur. Stack your goods with the precision of a Renaissance architect.
* **Toolbelt of Destiny**: Equip yourself with wire cutters, gloves, magnets, a collapsible ladder, and a smile. These are your Excalibur, your shield, your winning grin.

# Step 4: The Zen of Scrapper Psychology

To scrap is to meditate on the impermanence of material wealth. The washer on the curb today is the shiny appliance of yesteryear. Adopt an attitude of reverence, yet detachment. To be a successful scrapper, you must:

1. **See Value in Everything**: Even the crustiest pipe holds potential.
2. **Let Go of Guilt**: Sometimes you must abandon a heavier haul for lighter, more lucrative pickings. You are but one scrapper; you cannot save it all.
3. **Exude Gratitude**: Thank the universe (or at least the homeowner) for every precious chunk of aluminum.

# Step 5: Scrapping 2.0‚ÄîTech Savvy Salvaging

Leverage the power of technology to become the Elon Musk of the scrapping world:

* **Metal Market Mastery**: Stay updated on metal prices using apps and websites. Know the exact moment when copper‚Äôs price per pound will buy you that dream yacht (or at least a better truck).
* **Scrap GPS**: Use mapping tools to plan the most fuel-efficient routes.
* **Social Media Mojo**: Post your services on Facebook Marketplace, TikTok, or Instagram. Imagine viral videos of you dismantling a trampoline with the tagline, ‚ÄúTrash to cash in 30 seconds!‚Äù

# Step 6: Scrapyard Diplomacy

When you roll into the scrapyard, you are not merely dropping off metal; you are engaging in high-stakes diplomacy. Know your weights, your materials, and your market. Greet the staff with a warm ‚ÄúGood morning!‚Äù and maybe even a cup of coffee. A happy scrapyard worker is more likely to overlook that extra bit of paint on your aluminum siding.

# Step 7: Ethical Scrapping and the Cosmic Balance

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Do not poach from private property without permission. Resist the urge to dismantle your neighbor‚Äôs satellite dish for the juicy stainless-steel mount. The cosmos smiles on those who scrap with integrity.

# The Scrapping Manifesto‚Äôs Final Word

In this sprawling, consumer-driven world, the scrapper stands as a beacon of resilience and ingenuity. You are not merely scavenging metal; you are salvaging hope, re-forging the bonds between human ambition and planetary stewardship. So go forth, oh valiant scrapper! Arm your truck with tools, your heart with purpose, and your mind with the endless possibilities of the curbside cosmos.

My doctor doesn‚Äôt want me to be on it for a long period of time because it can give you high blood pressure since it‚Äôs a stimulant, he says it‚Äôs like coffee. He wants me to switch to Lexapro. I was thinking of using it when I was on 30mg to help with intrusive thoughts but I just up the dosage instead . I was on it for 8days.  

Have you guys been on Adderall for a long period of time ? For how many years ? Any health issues ? Like heart related ? 

Here‚Äôs what the pharmacist told me : 

The pharmacist says that lexapro and adderall are two completely different medications. She said that if you benefit from adderall and you don‚Äôt have an history of heart diseases and seizures,you should keep taking em. lexapro is a SSi and long term usage can also give side effects. She says there‚Äôs a lot of data on Adderall and how it‚Äôs effective and helps. She said that lexapro is not as affective. And that adderall is more to manage adhd related symptoms. She also said that you can take breaks for like holidays or whatever. But there‚Äôs tons of data on the medication and it‚Äôs safe to use if you don‚Äôt have a medical history such as heart diseases and seizures. 

I‚Äôm the first person my physician prescribed Adderall to, he wanted to send me to a psychiatrist but they have long wait list and I went back to school in the fall so he‚Äôs been monitoring me. 
Ive lost 12lbs/5kg in month which worries him, I promised I was gonna try to eat more and my pulse went up from 88/63 and pulse 76 in Oct 18 so before. Now, yesterday it was 95/66  and pulse 100. When I was on 30mg I was 88/63 and my pulse was 81.

This medication is actually helping, he said that maybe we going to go down for the dose due to pulse and the weight loss.

I‚Äôm 26f btw lol 
I would like some advices please ? I‚Äôve tried non stimulants before and they did nothing, same for Ritalin.

Last Year, I had a doubt that maybe my bf is hiding something from me and my intuition is telling me na something is wrong with my bf, before that we had our misunderstandings and muntik na kami magbreak but we worked it out (sa pagaakala ko), not until he started telling me na comfort food niya raw ang ramen, sa 3 years naming magkasama he never once mentioned it or kahit kapag nasa labas kami ni hindi kami kumakain ng ramen that is why skeptical ako the moment he craved ramen. 2nd, he said if we ever go out we should stop by for coffee which is shocking to me because he made it clear na hindi siya nagkakape like literally 2 weeks before that when I want to drink coffee at inalok ko siya, lastly I once put my IG acc (nakapost ang mga pics namin) in public and he immediately reached out to me, bakit daw nagpublic ako may gusto raw ba akong patunayan and shit so I put it back sa private. But, like a stupid girl binalewala ko lahat yon. Moving on after like 2 months start na ng class, kababalik ko lang ulit sa school (school of nursing) after 3 yrs na nagstop ako bcoz of covid. 

Anyways bday ng kaibigan niya kinabukasan but the celebration is the same day, so after school dumiretsyo ako sa bahay ng friend niya bibit yung mga libro ko hindi man lang ako sinundo. Upon arriving they welcomed me, may handaan, meron din pool (yung inaassemble), and syempre inuman. 

FF, bandang 1am dahil na rin pagod nagpaalam na ako sa bf ko na magpapahinga na muna ako pumayag naman siya kaya nagbanlaw na ako at pumunta sa kwarto na nakaassign sa amin, while drying my hair nakita ko ang phone niya and of course me kinuha ko  (take note: he doesn't even know I knew his pin nakita ko lang nung one time na tinype niya) I opened his phone, sa una wala naman akong nakita na mali, kinalkal ko ang gallery niya, wala naman akong mali na makita in the mid of scrolling so I felt really bad na kinakalkal ko ang phone niya without his knowledge but there is something inside me na nagsasabing ""you should dig deep"", ""dig deep"", ""magscroll ka pa"" I opened his phone once again, go to his photos, scroll furthermore and there I saw him with a girl (his classmate) in the mall eating ramen, drinking coffee and shit. damn hahaha it still hurts kahit taon na ang nakalipas, my whole world colapse kasi siya ang huling taong inaakalang kong masasaktan ako but he did it effortless. I went to their conversation and it made my heart shatter into pieces, I saw how he is willing to go to her house pero ako hindi niya mapuntahan, they had been seeing each other for about 6 months at wala akong clue? asan ako non? bakit wala akong kaalam alam?  the one I can't forget is when we are fixing our things for out trip in zambales nagchat yung girl kung magkano raw ang rates nung pinagmotelan nila, sh*t ayun ba yung araw na chinat ko kapatid niya tapos sabi umalis raw siya pero ang sabi niya tulog siya?  Grabe yung nginig ko that time, tinatry ko picturean convo nila with my phone but I can't kasi sobrang nginig ko at iyak na ako nang iyak. Don ko narealize lahat ng mga bagay sa kanya na hindi ko magets noon. I reached out one of his classmate and thank God she is kind enough to tell me what I need to know when I asked her she said na nagkaron nga raw ng something kasagsagan ng breakup namin I told her na hindi kami kailan man nagbreak and she is shock because my bf told them we broke up that is why no one is reaching to me at bakit siya nabother nung nagpublic ako. 

Gulong-gulo na ako that time hindi ko alam sino lalapitan ko for help kasi hindi ko kinakaya yung sakit sobrang nasasaktan ako kasi lahat ng lies, lahat ng pandidisrespect narealize ko, lahat ng panggagago sa akin. Halos masuka ako sa mga nakita at nalaman ko that night. Actually, that moment hindi ko alam anong mga gagawin ko kasi hindi ko kailan man naisip na masasaktan niya ako o magagawa niya sakin lahat yon.

I confronted him same night, took a week before I had the courage to asked him about the cheating and he denied a lot of things, pinagkaitan niya ako ng sagot sa lahat ng tanong ko and I can't push it any longer because I am tired of endlessly thinking. I tried praying, palagi akong nagdadasal na sana alisin na ang sakit sa akin na sana kung may mga bagay man akong hindi pa alam kusa kong malaman. after some time, he changed naman na, bumabawi siya sa akin and I know it kasi ibang-iba na ang pakikitungo niya sa akin pero bakit ngayon lang? kung kelan nasasaktan na ako at walang tiwala? 

Hanggang ngayon sinasabi ko sa kanya na nahihirapan pa rin ako at nasasaktan, na hanggang ngayon naaalala ko pa rin ang lahat kaya hindi ko maibigay ng buo yung tiwala at love kasi nandito pa rin sa akin lahat. nakikita ko sa kanya na nahihirapan din siya that's why I feel bad kasi ginagawa naman niya lahat pero anong magagawa ko? sobrang hirap masaktan at magpatuloy sa araw na naaalala ko ang lahat.

I bought the machine second hand and replaced parts 43, 44, 46, 47, 49 because it was dripping from the portafilter before. I am worried that I might have broken something and I cannot find anything in the internet to support or contradict that suspicion. 

The coffee itself tastes way too acidic (~14g, finest grinding size on Dedica coffee mill, 28-42ml espresso, highest temperature, unfiltered hard water, pressurised basket).

We had a very mixed experience at Grace Bay club this past August so I thought I'd document some of the details in case it could help others better prepare packing wise and mentally for their trip.

We did go at the tail end of the true ""season"", the first week of August, so we were told things were quite a bit quieter at the resort (and on TCI in general) than usual. We want to blame this for the poor service we experienced while at the resort. Thinking maybe the service staff was ""over it"" -not expecting much from people traveling in a less expensive season?  I had only read the most glowing reviews of service, kindness, ""feeling like family"" etc at GBC but instead we were mostly ignored by all beach/pool attendees and wait staff. We had to hunt down towels, ask for (drink orders, food orders, can we have a chair, etc) repeatedly. I went out of my way to tip generously, smile, be friendly and was consistently met with coldness (with only 2 exceptions during our 4 night stay).

I'd told the prearrival team we were there to celebrate my birthday, yes, but moreso we were celebrating that it had been 5 years since I had finished treatment for Breast Cancer - my husband and I were celebrating this milestone (which in the TNBC community is a big, big milestone) with this bucketlist trip. I probably had my hopes up too high.

ROOM: Online and Trip Advisor shows gorgeous, bright rooms with beds and couches that overlook the stunning Grace Bay. We were placed in a 1st floor room which at first glance was dark, cold, austere. We eventually realized that we could walk 5 steps to the pool/hot tub and 12 steps to the beach. The 1st floor location made our trips in and out of our room easier, certainly. I made myself a cup of coffee and drank it with my toes in the sand every morning! That was wonderful - but the bedroom was in the very back, in a room with no view. If you are a light sleeper, need blackouts to rest - these 1st floor rooms would be ideal for you. If you wanted to look at the gorgeous beach while lounging in bed, not so much.

The bathroom needs SOMEWHERE to hang towels. 1 hook. That's all there is. With wet towels from multiple showers, wet bathingsuits etc, it just seemed strange that they want us to drape our things in the tub, I guess?

Bed was super comfortable; linens were clean and so crisp and soft. I slept like a baby in that cave of a bedroom.

FOOD & DRINK: The vast majority of the food we ate was great. Presentation and taste altogether, it was really excellent. The pork shank ssam we had at Infinity was a highlight. All of the drinks were well mixed, delicious and as strong as they should be, no light handed pours! The taco spot on the beach had great drinks, lovely place to get a drink but they had music playing SO LOUDLY out of a crappy speaker that I couldn't hear myself think. We tried to move away from the bar to sit somewhere farther from the music and they said ""wait wait let us put towels down on those seats"" and then just...never came back. I know island time needs to be respected and taken into consideration but, if you're telling me I can't sit down b/c you have to do something, and then you just stand there and talk to your coworkers for 10 minutes...and I'm still holding chips and salsa and standing in the sand next to the couch...and you don't bring the towel...what am I supposed to do?

SPA: We booked our spa appointments with the pre-arrival team before we came. The concierge who showed us to our room when we first arrived didn't know about this, had no paperwork and when I asked about it just said ""oh, well if you booked it the spa knows about it"". The day of our service we were just getting ready  at noon to head to our 12:30 appointments (planning to arrive 15 min early as they asked), when we got a call to our room that said we were late for our noon appointments. I corrected them, explained I had the email confirmation, it was 12:30. They corrected me right back and said no we should have arrived already. OK no problem, we hustled over there and showed up within 5 minutes. We heard no more about being ""late"" and truly had the BEST massage experiences either of us had ever had. Ari provided a Balense massage that blew me away, actually brought me to tears because I'd spent the last 24 hours feeling like we'd spent $1000 a night for this poor service, dark, dank room, being ignored everywhere we went - and I finally felt a moment of calm and joy and was appreciating the experience.

CONCIERGE/HOST: When we arrived we were offered fruit juice or water and a place to sit. I sort of figured a rum cocktail or a glass of champagne was customary for this $ort of $ituation but I'm not usually big drinker so I brushed it off. Our ""personal concierge"" called me by the wrong name repeatedly, seemed offput about us being ""late"" based on what we'd told them in our prearrival emails - but our flight had been rescheduled - they had our flight information, I'm not sure why they ask for it if they don't use it?

Our concierge eventually left us in the room but luggage was no where to be found. We walked around a bit...visited the ""afternoon tea"" (where there was a single scone left) for a quick bite and when we came back an hour later our luggage had been delivered. That was so weird, to be left in the room without the luggage?

The WhatsAp communication was swift, useful and a nice way for people to communicate with the concierge. They should let people know what to download before they arrive though - my husband was stuck, couldn't authenticate his account b/c he had no cell service.

We asked for help booking a snorkeling excursion, which they took care of very quickly and booked us on a trip exactly as we asked for a reasonable rate.

One night we approached the Infinity host stand to ask for a seat at the bar for a drink and as I said ""hello!"" the host responded ""I'm sorry we are fully booked tonight and cannot take walk ups"". That's it. No hello. No smile. I didn't even want one of the tables he was asking for, I was just being courteous and asking if the bar was open seating. We sat anyway and had a great drink/sunset view.

CLEAN: Room was always spotless, pools were SO clean, so neat.

BEACH: there's a ""flag"" system to get a drink/service. Seems to work sometimes. I had to steal a flag from empty chairs to get help at one of the beds. The attendant was like ""ok ok I see your flag I got you"" and we had a laugh. He also went out of his way to put up extra umbrellas so we could have more shade. They covered every square inch of the bed with towels which was very nice and extremely comfortable!  When attendees were at the stations they helped pretty quickly (towels, drinks etc) but they'd disappear for 30-40 minutes at a time.

POOL: 100% ignored by pool attendees at the adult pool for hours. Walked by us, offering drinks, menus to other guests. We tried to wave them down, smile, ""hello!"". Just ignored. The swim up bar at the family pool was so busy with people just standing at the bar and drinking/talking that you couldn't get a drink (this is not a GBC problem but a people problem).

GROUNDS: The overall grounds are beautiful. Established landscaping, well swept, well trimmed. Little shelves to store your sandals as you walk out to the beach. If the concierge had walked us along the paved path that ran parallel to the beach the layout of the resort and how to efficiently get to and from the restaurants and amenities would have made more sense but we figured it out eventually (this might have only been relevant b/c we were in that 1st floor room).

On our last evening we came back to get ready for dinner and found balloons, wine, and a cake. A nice touch, certainly, but the night before we leave? Isn't this the kind of thing that we should arrive to? Maybe there was some logic to this for the GBC team, but for us we just felt like it was another way we felt like they'd forgotten about us.

\---  
NOTE: I've had this saved in drafts for 2+ months b/c I didn't want to kneejerk post it. But it's been 2 months and I'm less mad, more sad that such an expensive, bucketlist trip was tainted by made to feel ""less than"" the rest of the guests, by service and attitudes. I hope this is helpful to others. If you have questions about our experience please let me know and I'll give any additional detail I can to be helpful. ",4,1732654013.0,TurksAndCaicos,0,1.0,False

It's kinda weird, you know? This isn't something he's done before, and it's not like he's touchy-feely or anything, but the whole situation feels off.  
  
We do hang out for coffee and lunch sometimes, but being alone at a bar felt different. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it, 'cause grad school relationships with faculty are different, right? He's not known for being creepy, and he's got plenty of female friends, but this still feels a bit much. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I might need to take a step back.  
  
Any thoughts? Am I just being paranoid here?",2,1732653786.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

==================

**Memory transcription subject: Vilsa, spaceborne salvage technician.**

*On board atmo shuttle to Earth*

*Day 6 of rotation*

\-----

I was freaking out in a shuttle again. And you know what? I was getting pretty tired of it, too. It had happened first on my way to Earth‚Äôs orbit, and now it was happening again on my way down to its actual surface.

At least Mack‚Äôs shuttle was a hell of a lot nicer than the one the Isto had sent. It had comfy seats that leaned back, and little tables and a station just for snacks! And coffee! Mostly coffee. And *windows.*¬†

I watched it all through them as we maneuvered through the designated orbital traffic zones, thinking. Panicking. Argh.

It wasn‚Äôt even the whole ‚Äúoh no predators!‚Äù thing!! I knew plenty well that Earth was *fine.* I *get* that. It‚Äôs not some insane monster planet where I‚Äôll be fighting off predators from the moment I step off the ramp, that‚Äôs ridiculous. All of Mack‚Äôs venlil friends survived Earth just fine. And humans aren‚Äôt really *that* scary. That‚Äôs not the problem. The *problem‚Ä¶* is‚Ä¶¬†

I took a deep breath and pressed my forehead against the glass. I thought about Emli, who said she now felt so changed and different that she only felt normal around humans. And Rulsom, who told me how nervous he was to even go back home to Venlil Prime. Was it time? Was it closeness? Was there a specific moment when the switch would flip and I would be like them too?

If I had said no to this trip, and called my parents like I was supposed to, would I be okay? Or have I already passed that point of no return? I‚Äôd been herding with these humans for a week already and it was *easy.* It was *easy* and I *liked* it.

And Steven? Oh, don‚Äôt even talk about *him.* That whole mess of feelings. And he had *no idea.* He sat next to me telling me all about what Earth was like and how safe it was and how he would be there and I didn‚Äôt know how to tell him that that wasn‚Äôt what I was so worried about. How could I tell him when he was right there in the center of it?

The shuttle turned and dipped forward into the atmosphere. The windows began to heat up and flicker red with burning air, and we hurtled down to the surface. I wanted to be done being scared of it. I liked being this new Vilsa, so why am I still so scared?

*No.*

No, you know what? I *am* done with that. No more being scared of New Vilsa. New Vilsa wears braids now. New Vilsa is cool as shit. New Vilsa is going to go down to Earth and have a great time with her human herd and then after that she‚Äôs gonna go do whatever else she wants with her life!¬†

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù I added, out loud for some reason.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh, uhh, nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúO-okay.‚Äù

The shuttle pitched back up as we got into more comfortable atmosphere. From here, it was a pretty short trip. That was the nice thing about coming in from orbit; it was really fast to get anywhere you wanted on the planet. We‚Äôd started out on one side of the planet, but by the time we‚Äôd been cleared for re-entry, we were on the other side of it, right over where we needed to go.

Our destination was somewhere on the west coast of Canada, though where exactly was difficult to tell; as we got closer, all we could see were these vast stretches of clouds that were so fat and heavy with rain we couldn‚Äôt even hope to see the ground from above.

But once we broke through the clouds, stars, it was gorgeous. The water droplets rolled off my window and we could see the endless green forests coating the jagged mountain peaks. The trees seemed to reach upwards, and the clouds downwards to meet them. Fingers of fog crept through the valleys, and I could see weeping streaks in the distance where it was raining.

The trees passing by below us were so densely packed, and so darkly green under the overcast sky that it was almost *eerie.* Like there was some unspeakable unknowableness to them. Like if you walked into those dark woods without a map, you‚Äôd wander forever.

But maybe that was just me. Venlil preferred open, empty spaces, after all. Humans didn‚Äôt seem to mind the dense woods at all. The few towns we‚Äôd flown over seemed to have been plopped down right in the middle of them, the borders between town and tree all blending together.

We flew for a few more minutes before alighting on a quaint little airport set along the shore. Mack had called it his ‚Äúlocal puddle jumper airport.‚Äù There wasn‚Äôt much more than a stubby traffic tower and a handful of buildings, with the sea on one side and the forest pressing in on all the others.¬†

I kept peeking out the windows trying to see more! I felt‚Ä¶ excited! Which felt nice in a different way. Kind of freeing! Unfortunately, roughly half of the passengers did not share my excitement.

‚ÄúUuerrurggh,‚Äù Steven whined pathetically, reaching up to me. ‚ÄúVilsa help meee‚Ä¶‚Äù

He was not alone. Chan was levering herself up out of her seat with a grimace, Ed and Aldo were hardly faring better, seeming to summon the courage just to stand up out of their seats.

*Ah yes. The gravity.* The bone density pills and muscle stimulants we all take can only do so much, I supposed.

On the other paw, I felt nice and light! Roughly 20% stronger, I‚Äôd have to guess! Myself, Emli, Lemm, Vemnka, and Mack had all hopped eagerly up out of our seats with no issues.

I laughed and pulled Steven upright. He felt so light! He proceeded to make a big show of being extra pitiable. ‚ÄúMy bones‚Ä¶‚Äù he lamented, clinging on to me.

*New Vilsa does not bloom like a schoolgirl,* I reminded myself.

‚ÄúMy poor beleaguered bones,‚Äù Steven continued, trying his absolute best to fall limply into my arms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dying.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened to the big scary humans with all the muscles?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing in the gym all day?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe might of humanity is nothing compared to gravity sickness.‚Äù

‚ÄúGravity sickness?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a real thing,‚Äù Chan butted in, holding her eyes closed with her hands and looking like she was about to be sick. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been up top for too long, so we took some normalizers. Supposed to help with the dizziness and muscle weakness, but it makes you kinda ache-y. We just call it that for fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúVilsa yer gonna have to carry me,‚Äù Steven insisted.

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Ed said.

‚ÄúYou guys are a herd of pups,‚Äù Emli said, shoving her face up against a window. Her tail was dancing happily in excitement.

‚ÄúOh, okay, *you* go back to VP after two rotations and tell me how easy it is,‚Äù Steven shot back, smirking and suddenly having no difficulties standing fully upright.¬†

Vemnka laughed. Her tail was bobbing too, she must have been excited to be back on Earth as well. It was contagious, I could feel my own tail going behind me. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go check it out! Mack, wake up,‚Äù she said, swinging her tail ring to go clanking loudly off Mack‚Äôs metal leg.

Mack woke up with a start, springing to his feet. ‚ÄúRight!‚Äù he said, opening the door and leading us down the steps. We followed eagerly, despite some (mostly, I hoped) theatrical groaning. Though I guess there was probably a reason why only a few of the longtime crew elected to come down with us for a day trip.

The very first thing I noticed was that Earth was‚Ä¶ chilly. And kinda damp! A few little gusts of wind were trying their hardest to get under my fur. I immediately felt like I understood the other half of why humans are so obsessed with clothing. Could have just been today‚Äôs weather, though. Or seasons, which Earth had. It *was* rather gloomy and gray at the moment. And the mist wasn‚Äôt helping.

I took a big deep breath, scenting as much of the alien planet as I could. It was the first one I‚Äôd ever been on! This one tasted to me woody and green and fresh, and wonderfully sweet.

‚Äú*Ouh--!!*‚Äù Ed grunted suddenly, pointing out towards the sea.

We turned to look and saw, not too terribly far from where we were, a curious disturbance in the water. Something floating by, until -- no, it *rose up* \-- a head of some animal! A *big* one. A great, brown-furred, antlered form, rising out of the shallows with a cascade of water.

It strode easily up onto the runway, looking otherworldly in the moody mist.

And then it stopped, turning to cast a *disdainful* glare at us.

‚ÄúUh oh,‚Äù said several humans.

‚ÄúYeah, let‚Äôs get inside,‚Äù Chan said, moving to usher us over towards the buildings.

‚ÄúNo, stay here,‚Äù Mack said.

The humans stayed put, although not without some nervous shuffling. It was weird, I‚Äôd never even thought to imagine them like this, let alone see it with my own eyes! Yeah, it was a big animal, sure, taller at the shoulder than any of us, but it was clearly still a prey animal!

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Emli asked, as Lemm surreptitiously took out his pad to record some video for his wife.

‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs most famous megafauna!‚Äù Mack answered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a moose. They can have a bit of a temper, so if it‚Äôs paying direct attention to us‚Ä¶ best to just stay put, don‚Äôt do anything that might provoke it and‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off as the moose turned and casually sauntered away. ‚ÄúUsually they lose interest pretty quick.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre they‚Ä¶ dangerous?‚Äù Lemm asked, still staring into his pad and filming.

‚ÄúWell, they weigh about as much as my car and aren‚Äôt afraid of us at all. Would *not* want to get trampled, even *my* organs aren‚Äôt stomp-proof.‚Äù

Lemm stopped filming to stare at him.

‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre not usually aggressive. Ornery, sometimes. But attacks are pretty rare so long as you don‚Äôt do anything stupid.‚Äù

It went quiet for a bit, until Emli started laughing.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Lemm asked.

‚ÄúNothing! It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ backwards-ass planet, I swear. It‚Äôs just funny! It keeps happening!‚Äù She said.

The humans all laughed at that, while I watched the animal slip between the shrouded trees. New Vilsa decided that she liked this ‚Äòmoose‚Äô creature very much. No surprises there, of course she did! The thing just popped up out of nowhere, stared down Earth‚Äôs alleged apex species, and then walked off to go do its own thing. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs cool,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThey are pretty impressive animals,‚Äù Mack admitted.

‚ÄúYeah and you can‚Äôt even intimidate them right back! They ain‚Äôt scared of shit.‚Äù Ed added.

‚ÄúNo they are not. You know that‚Äôs been our strategy since the stone age? Animal like that that‚Äôs bigger than you and knows it, the best thing you can do is *not piss it off.* And back down if you have to!‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, I thought you were supposed to stand your ground?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yes. But that‚Äôs the backup strategy if it goes for a bluff charge. You probably already fucked up if you‚Äôve gotten yourself in that situation. See, it‚Äôs like a‚Ä¶ communication. There‚Äôs a type of respect on both sides.‚Äù

New Vilsa thought the moose was *even cooler* now.

‚ÄúAnyways, let‚Äôs go get checked in.‚Äù

We moved into the biggest of the buildings, where a big human and an also big venlil were waiting for us.

The venlil, I could immediately guess must have been Kimmich -- Vemnka‚Äôs dad. The likeness between him and Vemnka was impossible to miss. They both had the same athletic build, and the same close exterminator cut to show it off. They were practically the same venlil, even having the same exact black-with-gray-speckles pattern! The only real differences were that Vemnka was a little shorter, had some brown splotches around her shoulders, and her exterminator cut ended precisely at her preposterous head floof.

The human was likewise tall and broad-shouldered, with bright golden hair, and was also the reason I knew they were both waiting for us specifically. He was gleefully holding up a big handmade sign that read ‚ÄúWelcome home robo dick!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Mason and Kimmich,‚Äù Mack muttered, striding ahead of us.

Mason jiggled his sign, grin widening like he knew it was hilarious. Kimmich crossed his arms and stared broodily at us. A lot at me in particular, for some reason‚Ä¶ not sure what that was about.

Mack drew up close to Mason. ‚ÄúRobo dick‚Ä¶?‚Äù

For a moment, it very nearly felt tense, as Mason just waited, still grinning‚Ä¶ but then they both laughed and erupted into a sudden embrace. ‚ÄúGood to see you, man,‚Äù Mason said, patting his back.

Kimmich and Vemnka embraced similarly, tails wrapping around and snouts tucking into each other‚Äôs shoulders. Kimmich still managed to look very stern and severe doing it, though.

We did the rest of the introductions with good nature. I stared about, checking out the interior of the first human building I‚Äôd been in (the Istomeini doesn‚Äôt count. Spaceships are different). I was struck by how‚Ä¶ well, ‚Äúunguarded‚Äù wasn‚Äôt really the right word. But something like that. There wasn‚Äôt even anyone else in here! Totally empty, aside from a few self-service consoles.

‚ÄúLast time, someone from the UN came out to greet us,‚Äù Vemnka noted.

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs been a bit since those first few days, huh?‚Äù Mack said. ‚ÄúThere are some people working up in the tower, but otherwise, it‚Äôs usually like this around this time. I think it‚Äôs been long enough now to be‚Ä¶‚Äù his hands cycled in the air.

‚ÄúNormal?‚Äù Captain Chan suggested, the word drenched in some darkly disdainful tone.

Mack seemed to consider the suggestion, but only very briefly. ‚Äú...Less of a priority. But! You still have to at least sign something somewhere,‚Äù he said, pointing towards the self-service consoles. ‚ÄúSince you were all on the flight plan.‚Äù

The terminals were a little frustrating to navigate for us aliens. They didn‚Äôt have built-in translation, so we had to use our visual translators, and of course the print scanners didn‚Äôt work for us either, so we had to use alternative identification methods for that.

But soon enough, all of us were moving through the prompts and questions. It was pretty bare, not really all that much more than verifying who we were, and a few questions like if we were bringing any organic materials, and purpose of visit. That last one stumped me for a bit, my claw hovering over the available answers. This didn‚Äôt count as tourism, did it?

Chan cleared her throat loudly, standing in front of her own console. ‚ÄúThis is a business trip,‚Äù She announced. ‚ÄúWe are here for work-related purposes.‚Äù

*Ah.*¬†

I clicked on ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô and tapped through the rest of it.

Vemnka was finished long before the rest of us -- she‚Äôd been through this before, after all. Her name was already in the system. She‚Äôd moved over to stand with her dad, and Mack, and the three of them had started whisper-arguing about something. Kimmich‚Äôs tail was lashing about with displeasure, and his ears were set forward.

I didn‚Äôt really catch much of it, though. I was busy with paperwork. But by the time I was finishing up, they must have cleared it up, because Kimmich‚Äôs ears had relaxed, and his tail had switched into more of an amused flicking than anything else.

When we were all done, we headed to the parking lot, where there were two lonely cars waiting for us. One was slender and crouched low to the ground, with long, sweeping angles set into the sides and front. It looked as if it were trying harder to be distinctive than it was to be practical.

Mack had called that one a ‚Äúclassic.‚Äù Looking at the interiors, I would have said that that was a nice way of saying that the Federation would have destroyed it in the interest of public safety. The humans, however, had a different impression. They ooh-ed and ahh-ed at the shiny color-matching interior and primitive controls, Ed practically begging Mack to let him drive it.

The second vehicle, on the other paw, was altogether *too* practical. It was big and boxy and inelegant, the descriptor of ‚Äúrugged‚Äù being just as generous as ‚Äúclassic‚Äù was for the first car. There was all kinds of nonsense hanging off the roof racks or haphazardly attached wherever there was room. The paint was scratched and dinged up, and there was a broken branch wedged through the clearly aftermarket side rack. Possibly recently. It still had green leaves.

I piled into the first car with Ed driving, which was a mistake. The thing *drove* like a primitive vehicle, too. It was bumpy and kind of uncomfortable, and *loud.* And the odd seating arrangement could *not* have been safe. But everyone was having fun with that, so I was too.

Ed sent the engine screaming into the straights, and us flying through corners. ‚ÄúIt can handle it!!‚Äù he kept saying, while Chan berated him from the passenger seat. The rest of us in the back just laughed, tossed into each other with every hard brake and wild corner.

It was a good time. Plus, I could watch out the windows as we went! The mist was clearing up, and the sky brightened as the sun rose. What a strange thing, to be on a planet where you can watch the sun move with your naked eye. I mean, I knew it wasn't *strange,* if anything, *we* were the strange ones here. But still. It felt so‚Ä¶ gloriously alien.

What was definitely strange, though, was how *dense* this planet was with life. Seriously, it felt like you could hardly see even a tail‚Äôs length past the edge of the road, it was so thick with trees and ferns and moss. All you could see was just‚Ä¶ green. A lush, vibrant wall of green.

I‚Äôd heard rumors coming from online spaces about how untamed Earth‚Äôs wilderness areas were, but I didn‚Äôt really pay it too much heed at the time. Predator-related hysteria, or maybe just the novelty of a predator planet, I guess. Because it was easier to believe that there must have been some kind of extraordinary conditions for a planet to cradle sophont predator life. But it was all real, and it was somewhat uncanny at that.

We eventually arrived at Mack‚Äôs house, sequestered away into one of the many valleys. It was more like a sprawling complex than a single person‚Äôs house, a big mess of steep roofs and giant windows. It was a bit overwhelming, though still tasteful.

The cars parked themselves in the garage as we made our way to the front entrance. The interior was no less overwhelming than the exterior. Sleek, minimalist designs covered up by the beloved clutter of display pieces and art. Suits, statues, and frameless paintings gave the hallways some life, while deep cushions and plush carpets gave the rooms some warmth.

We made it only a room or two in before meeting the rest of Mack‚Äôs guests -- Sevkan and Jake. They were waiting for us in the game room, calling out as soon as they saw us. They‚Äôd made themselves quite the cozy little nest in here! Furniture had been moved around, and strange human instruments had been brought in, and the tables were full of drinks and dishes. And crumbs.

They waved us over warmly, standing up to meet us. Jake was another *interesting-*looking human. The top of his head was completely hairless, even more so than Steven‚Äôs, his ears were pierced through with some kind of jewelry, and his skin was swarming with inked-in designs. It reminded me of Mack‚Äôs decorated limbs, except that Jake‚Äôs were actually *in his skin.* Disturbing! Yet fascinating!

And Sevkan was‚Ä¶ not what I was expecting either! He didn‚Äôt look even a bit like his dad, beyond, again, an athletic figure. He was much more appropriately venlil-sized, with fur the opposite white color as Vemnka and Kimmich. Inherited more from his mom, maybe?

He also had *braids,* just like mine! The same glass beads and the same style. His were blue and gold, though. I remembered Mack mentioning he‚Äôd gotten some practice in already, I guess this must have been his handiwork then.

We commenced with more introductions, the whole while a curiously irregular noise going off in the background. I wasn‚Äôt the only one to hear it. I could see venlil ears all across the group swiveling to pinpoint the mysterious noise. It kept going off, almost like a brief, repeated shout. Muffled, but insistent.

Eventually, the human‚Äôs duller ears caught on to it as well.

‚ÄúIs that Huey?‚Äù Mack asked.

*Who is Huey?*

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Huey?‚Äù Aldo asked. Great question, in my opinion.

‚ÄúOh, we figured it might be a good idea to put him in a room at first. Didn‚Äôt want it to be too big of a surprise,‚Äù Jake said, adding a few more questions for me. ‚ÄúJust in case. Seemed to go over pretty well with Sev here, but, y‚Äôknow.‚Äù

No, I didn‚Äôt. Who the brahk is Huey??

‚ÄúMakes sense. You guys want to go meet Huey?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is Huey?‚Äù Lemm asked this time. Another excellent question.

‚ÄúThe most important member of the band!‚Äù Mason said.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a dog.‚Äù

*Ohhh‚Ä¶ the* other *human companion animal.* Well, so far‚Ä¶ I hadn‚Äôt met an Earth creature yet that I didn‚Äôt like, so‚Ä¶ yes, I *would* like to go meet Huey. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to!‚Äù I said, before even Emli could.

I have had the Aiden for a couple weeks and I am not impressed and questioning if I should keep it.

1.  The coffee does not stay hot in the carafe.  The reps on youtube say it ""stays hot for hours"" and then the site says it ""stays warm for hours"".  The fellow rep on reddit says it was tested for a full caraffe and stayed hot for 4 hours.  I think thats a highly questionable claim.  Now I batch smaller brews so I guess they didn't do QA on those?  Which doesn't make sense to me since you are marketing this for single / small batches.  I'm not getting anywhere close to those results and it appears I am not the only one.

My results (medium roast):

Trial 1: 155 F @ 0 mins

Trial 2: 142 F @ 15 mins

Trial 3: 128 F @ 40 mins

 Trial 4: 118 F @ 65 mins

I have not seen any reference that 118 would be considered hot, or even warm. 

2. So like I said, I had a sub par setup.  I upgraded to the Aiden and Ode Gen 2.  I know I have some tinkering to do, but for something that is over 10x the price I am not impressed.  On average it produces a better cup, but I have done side by side comparisons and it's much closer than you think.  And I am far from an expert in pourover.

1h0m1tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/1h0m1tj/the_best_decision_of_my_life/,The best decision of my life ,"I just had a moment of clarity today, realizing that not having children has been the best decision I‚Äôve ever made to date.

Here are some things I‚Äôm grateful for:

1. I‚Äôm not in debt. I grew up reckless and one day decided I didn‚Äôt want to be a fuck up anymore. Because I didn‚Äôt have kids, I was able to have use my time efficiently and steer my resources to fixing my addictions and bad credit ‚Äî which brings me to me my next point,
2. Because I‚Äôm not in debt, I have been able to fully-fund my college education out of pocket. Going back to school later in life has made school fun. I‚Äôm doing it purely for passionate and cognitive health, which is simultaneously helping in my career.
3. I‚Äôm aging very well. Because of no debt or parenting responsibilities, I can manage my time effectively to include exercise, a social life, work-life balance, relationships, education and hobbies. 
4. I wanted to learn a new hobby and I realized the sky is the limit. Because I don‚Äôt have anyone I have to prioritize over myself. I‚Äôm able to sit back and smell the flowers, literally with a book in hand and some coffee.

There are more, but I‚Äòll stop here. I‚Äôm just so grateful to be where I am. 

Say what you want, but choosing to be child-free has literally saved my life. ",37,1732653269.0,antinatalism,4,0.97,False

Its been a year since we started going out and it feels like he is always nitpicking! Once he asked for a cup of coffee and i was so nervous to make it that i refused because i knew he'd just point out my flaws and say sugar's less , milk's not enough etc. He was sick the other day, so i went to his place, cleaned his place, made tea with herbs for him, heated water for him to drink, washed his utensils etc..but since i was multitasking i spilled some tea and immediately cleaned it but he kept nagging how much time i take in making a cup of tea, it tasted like poison and he didn't even drink it halfway, i had to throw it out. 
He called me today and i said he had to clean again after i left cause i hadn't cleaned properly and the induction was malfunctioning cause i spilled some tea but it's okay now. (I was going to replace it but its working fine now).
Everything i do seems to annoy the shit out of him. It feels like everything i do is wrong and basically i'm stupid.
I now i can be careless at times and dumb too but i am not being annoying on purpose. I miss him so much that i travel an hour just to see him and we end up fighting each time.
Besides breaking up are there any other solutions cause I don't want to leave him.

He is stubborn with very strong boundaries but he always very happy to see me too and when i do visit him he never wants me to leave. But we suddenly end up fighting and he blames me for it. Maybe i really am the problem? There's so much friction that pops out of nowhere. One moment we are laughing and then something happens one of us gets upset and moment's ruined.
We do communicate everytime we were upset with each other. But this is happening too frequently neither of us have faced this in previous relationships and its honestly suprising how many fights we have. Please help,..we don't want to break up

My ideal¬†MBA¬†programme is Columbia since I'm not getting into H/S/W btw.



IB¬†is ultimately a fraternity and many bankers tend to be very similar - let's just say stereotypes exist for a reason. Diversity recruiting seems to be far more relevant at the undergraduate to analyst level and I'm not sure how important it is for post-MBA associate positions. Either way as a British part asian guy I don't think I would be classed as diversity anyway.



I have a British accent and English is my first language so communication isn't an issue, however there are so many aspects of American culture that I don't know and would need to immerse myself in to really connect with bankers in New York on a deeper level.



Being able to kick back and have a real convo like friends would do so much more for establishing deeper connections than simply asking the same usual questions during coffee chats that every international student asks.



As an international, I would automatically be at a disadvantage compared to US citizens born and raised in America so I would need to maximise every opportunity I have.



I'm honestly thinking of getting an American girlfriend here in London just for the next few years to prep myself fully on American culture. I'm a huge football fan (soccer for you Americans) but it isn't remotely as popular across the pond so I would have to start watching basketball and the NFL lol.



Do I support the Mets or the Yankees? Knicks or the Rockets?



I hate alcohol due to health reasons but have started drinking socially and would drink if needed during networking opportunities.



I should mention I already know quite a lot about America since I have family who are US citizens living there (I don't have a green card unfortunately) and have been there several times so it wouldn't be a huge culture shock to me unless I go to somewhere like Pierre, South Dakota lmfao.



I've been to New York plenty of times and it's a nice place aside from how suffocated downtown is and the massive rats running around. I know every US state and can name more American presidents than most Americans tbh and frequently follow US political developments since I find it a lot more interesting than UK politics. I actually know far more US politicians than UK politicians. I also know about 30% of the lyrics to your national anthem hahaha.

I cannot believe this guy. After he kept insisting that we go out, I finally gave in and went to grab a coffee with him. Long story short, we dated for about five months, and I bailed when he started showing signs of becoming abusive.


And now, he‚Äôs going around complaining that he‚Äôs way better than me in so many ways.

While we were together, he would constantly compliment me and act like I was the greatest thing that ever happened to him. And now this... Looking back, there were some signs. Sometimes he would give me a compliment, but in this weird comparative way. For example, he would say things like how I‚Äôm so much smarter than him or that I‚Äôm so much more emotionally healthy than he is. I was taken aback because relationships aren‚Äôt a competition. It doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs smarter; we‚Äôre both intelligent, and people can excel in different ways. You just can‚Äôt compare intelligence in such a black-and-white manner.


Well, apparently, he could. He kept comparing everything, and now he thinks he‚Äôs so much better than me, complaining about how unfair it is that I didn‚Äôt accept him ‚Äújust the way he was‚Äù like he supposedly accepted my much inferior self.


This has me so annoyed because:


A) ‚ÄúThe way he was‚Äù was abusive, and there‚Äôs no accepting that. I would much rather be single, with all my flaws, than stay in an abusive relationship.


B) He never mentioned any of this while we were together. Most of the time, he went out of his way to tell me how great I was. Sure, there were a few arguments where he hinted that there were things he didn‚Äôt like, but he refused to tell me what they were.

I want open communication in a relationship. If I had a problem with something, I told him so we could work through it. I expected the same honesty from him. It pisses me off that he pretended to like me instead of having an honest conversation about his feelings.

I don‚Äôt care if he thinks he‚Äôs better than me ‚Äì he‚Äôs free to believe whatever he wants. But I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with someone who thinks I‚Äôm beneath them. It‚Äôs completely within my rights to refuse this. And he strung me along for months.

If he‚Äôs so ‚Äúperfect,‚Äù great! But why bother me and insist on being together? Just let me go so I can find someone who actually appreciates me. I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs so desperate to have a girlfriend that he‚Äôd date someone he deems ‚Äúinferior.‚Äù That‚Äôs not my problem. I deserve a partner who respects me the way I respect them. It infuriates me that he lied and pretended just so his sorry self could have someone. I feel like wanting to leave him all over again just for pulling this shit.

TLDR at the bottom ,"My mom usually helps him out but she's on a trip visiting my sister. (Her first break in 7 years).

I'm really happy to be able to be here to help out but he makes it so difficult. His leg is amputated below the waist, because he got ill from diabetes. He has made almost no effort to lose weight so he can have a prosthetic. He eats whatever he wants, usually trash like burgers from McDonalds with milkshakes or liters of cream soda. And since hes been in a wheelchair the past 2 years he's been acting like he's totally incapable. He does nothing not even make a cup of coffee, he'll be right next to the drawer and ask to be handed a spoon. Him cooking means giving orders and occasionally stirring the pot or chopping an onion. (Once he's been handed the knife and onion and chopping board all within reach for him) My mom left on Saturday and he's been drinking everyday since. Today he was hone from 11 am to 7.20pm and he came home drunk. 

I'm the receptionist at our guesthouse but now I am also doing all the work my mom usually does- answering calls/emails/checking people in, managing housekeeping and overseeing a very stressful renovation.  Along with that I've been doing all the meals. So I did my shift today (9 am to 4 pm) but Im still available to answer calls/emails/texts. 

Today at 4:15 I just got home and put my things down when guests showed up at our house, I told them I just locked up and got home and I was actually not on duty anymore. (He takes our other worker with him into town to help him in and out of the car so he's paid to just sit at the bar and wait.) I asked the guests to wait for him to get back from town since they didn't have a booking and just showed up. 

When he got home he was pissed cause I didn't check them in and he told me I ""don't have working hours"" (Im being paid peanuts but Im doing this to help them out cause they can't actually afford someone who works the hours I do- I do a lot of work outside my job description and some days when we have functions Im working 6 am to 3 am the next day) then he proceeded to text my mom complaining about me. After he's been at the bar literally all day. 

My mom has been gone 3 days and I'm his caretaker/personal chef/receptionist/manager/cooking for guests all for less than I would make as a waitress. But he still shit talks me to my mom for telling the guests to wait cause I needed a break. I'm exhausted already and frankly PISSED. He's willfully being incompetent. I don't know how I'm going to do this for 3 weeks. 

TLDR; My stepfather is being willfully incompetent and expects me to work my ass off 24/7 for peanuts and badmouths me to my mom for needing a break. He could've had a prosthetic 2 years ago but he refuses to take care of himself and relies on my mom for everything. Some days he comes home drunk and ""nice"" so he keeps saying how much he loves my mom and telling the same story over and over. Other days he lies in bed just yelling ""fuck you"".

I recently had the opportunity to stay at Lopesan Punta Cana, and my experience was a mix of awe and disappointment. While the property itself was truly spectacular, featuring stunning architecture, elegant decor, and thoughtfully designed spaces like the British pub, sports bar, and coffee shops with exceptional drinks, there were several shortcomings in terms of service and maintenance that detracted from the overall experience.

**Pros:**

Beautiful Property: The overall design and atmosphere were nothing short of incredible. The kids‚Äô water park was a highlight for my family, and the beach was weed-free for the majority of our stay. The Unique Beach area was particularly advantageous for families with children, offering added convenience.

Dining: Contrary to some reviews, I found the food to be quite decent. The √† la carte restaurants provided enjoyable meals, though beef and steaks were consistently overcooked.

Pools and Bars: The pools were fantastic, and the wide variety of bars and coffee shops stood out for their unique ambiance and excellent drink offerings.

**Cons:**

Check-In Experience: Despite upgrading to the Unique package, the check-in process was chaotic and frustrating. Arriving earlier via private transfer appeared to catch the staff unprepared, leaving my tired and hungry kids waiting far too long.

Room Issues: The room location was far from the beach despite the Unique upgrade. Maintenance was disappointing‚Äîissues such as clogged drains, a malfunctioning fridge, a stuck toilet, and an uncovered balcony rendered the stay less comfortable than expected.

Unique Upgrade Disappointments: The advertised Unique amenities, such as a pillow menu, premium toiletries, turndown service, and a welcome drink, were notably absent. It felt as though we were placed in a standard room despite paying for the upgrade.

Service: The staff's attitude was inconsistent. While a few were exceptionally kind, many seemed indifferent or unwelcoming, which was disheartening.

Entertainment: Nighttime entertainment, especially for kids, was limited. What little there was started late (9:30 PM), making it impractical for families.

App Dependency: Many services and amenities relied heavily on the hotel's app, which could be challenging to navigate.

**Recommendation:**

While there is much to admire about Lopesan Punta Cana‚Äîthe breathtaking property, outstanding bars and coffee shops, and some truly enjoyable moments‚Äîthe operational and service shortcomings are difficult to ignore. Families or guests considering the Unique package should weigh the additional costs against the limited benefits we experienced. 

Ultimately, Lopesan Punta Cana has the potential to deliver an incredible experience, but improvements in service, maintenance, and entertainment are necessary to match the beauty of the property. 

**AMA** if any of my suggestions would help you with your decision. 

**Rating:** 

Property: 10/10

Room: 5/10

Food: 7/10

Service: 6/10

Beach: 7/10

Pool: 9/10

1h0ljia,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Euphoric_Fisherman59/comments/1h0ljia/my_family_threw_me_a_party_after_i_cashed_my/,My family threw me a party after I cashed my lottery winnings.,"‚ÄúFamily is everything. Always remember that, Jordan.‚Äù Those were the words spoken by my parents on my 10th birthday, and they‚Äôve echoed in my mind ever since. Now, as an adult with a psychology degree, struggling to make ends meet, those words felt more like a cruel joke.¬†



One Monday afternoon, in a moment of desperation, I stopped at a gas station and spent $20 on a scratch off ticket. When I got home and scratched it, my heart nearly stopped. Two million dollars. The numbers stared back at me. Ecstatic, I called my parents to share the news. Their joy matched mine, and they immediately started making plans for a huge family celebration. In retrospect, making that call was the worst mistake I‚Äôve ever made. I should‚Äôve kept it to myself. What happened next left me scarred forever.



It took weeks before I finally deposited the lump-sum check into my account. But as soon as it cleared, the knives came out.¬†



They threw me a grand dinner party to celebrate, with my parents, and five rough looking cousins I‚Äôd never met showed up. Becoming an instant millionaire and spending the night celebrating with loved ones felt like the perfect ending to my story. The table was overflowing with all kinds of food and drinks, but it was the wine that caught my attention. On a good day, I could easily down two to four bottles.



Unfortunately, the joy didn‚Äôt last. Things began to take a turn for the worse.



Almost everyone bombarded me with questions‚Äîdemanding my bank account details and prying into what I planned to do with the money. They were relentless in their curiosity about my future, but I refused to share anything and stepped outside to clear my head. The wine I‚Äôd been drinking left a sour taste in my mouth, and a wave of nausea hit me. Stumbling onto the porch, I collapsed and blacked out.¬†



When I woke up hours later, I groggily got to my feet and went back into the farmhouse. Something was off. The house was shrouded in darkness, and no one was around. It was as if everyone had vanished without a trace. That was when the nightmare truly began.



When lights flickered back on, everyone was seated around the dinner table, staring daggers at me. My mother, Grace, launched into a tirade about how the farmhouse was supposedly days away from foreclosure. But that was a lie, since we paid it off last year through a loan. My father, Mark, pressed me to hand over my bank account details, claiming he was behind on child-support payments to his ex-wives. I held my ground, firmly refusing. My five rough-looking cousins sat in silence; their eyes fixed on me with unsettling intensity. Disgusted, I expressed my deep disappointment to my family and turned to leave, heading for my car.



They jumped on me before I could reach it. Someone jammed a needle into my arm, injecting me with an unknown substance. I blacked out, and when I woke up, it was midnight. I was inside a small-town jail cell, surrounded by two dead cops, with blood coating my hands. I looked up and saw my family members snapping pictures of me from outside the cell.¬†



Lord almighty, I‚Äôd been framed for murder by my own family. I screamed at them to let me out, insisting their plan would fall apart because of the surveillance cameras in the station. But my cousins only laughed, casually pointing out that the jail was old, and the cameras hadn‚Äôt worked in years. I froze at the revelation.



They swung open the cell door and advised me to run, cause as of today, I was officially a cop killer whose luck had run out. They bolted out of the police station.¬†



I stepped out of the cell and examined the bodies of the dead cops. Their throats had been slashed so deeply that the cuts exposed bone. I bolted out of the station after hearing sirens, but I was jumped again, this time by the five rough-looking cousins I‚Äôd never met. They injected me with an unknown substance, and I passed out.



I jolted awake inside the town‚Äôs small church, lying close to the altar. The altar was smeared with flesh and blood. Turning around, I gasped at the rows of dead parishioners sitting in their seats, butchered. My heart pounded so hard it felt unbearable; was this some twisted nightmare, or had I truly killed these people, like the two cops at the station? I didn‚Äôt have the answers yet, but I was prepared to fight tooth and nail to uncover the truth.



I stepped out of the church and came face-to-face with a crowd in hooded white robes, their flashlights pointed at me. I considered running into the woods, since the church was deep in a secluded, forested area, but I wasn‚Äôt sure I could outrun them. My head throbbed, dizziness blurred my vision, and I felt completely drained, both physically and mentally. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîwhat kind of drug had my family injected me with?



I dashed into the woods, glancing back to see if anyone was following. Reaching a clearing, I paused to catch my breath, waiting for the hooded figures to appear, but no one did. I spotted a small shed nearby and slipped inside, taking the chance to relive myself. Just as I finished, a powerful force slammed into the shed, flipping me upside down. It didn‚Äôt sound like any animal; it was more like a truck crashing into it. I scrambled out just as the shed tipped over. Before I could steady myself, conjoined twins rushed up to me with a taser, and the next thing I knew, I was on the ground, paralyzed, falling into unconsciousness, again.



I woke up on a stretcher in a decaying medical clinic, a middle-aged nurse with rotten teeth standing beside me. When I asked how I‚Äôd ended up here, she stayed silent, her gaze more focused on my pockets than my wellbeing. I got off the stretcher, warning her to stay away from me. She just stared at me, then whispered something chilling‚Äîshe knew about the lottery I‚Äôd cashed recently. And that‚Äôs when it hit me: my family, the hooded figures in the forest, conjoined twins in the clearing and now this nurse‚Äî they were all after my money.



‚ÄúI won it! It‚Äôs mine!‚Äù I shouted, struggling to stay upright. She laughed, exposing her decaying teeth, and murmured a few words that sent a wave of dread through me.



‚ÄúFamily is everything, Jordan,‚Äù she whispered, stepping closer to me. But she wasn‚Äôt family. I was certain she was bluffing. I turned and bolted out of the clinic, stumbling and nearly collapsing as I crashed to the ground, only to find myself surrounded by smirking bare-chested rednecks aiming their rifles at me. My vision wasn't getting any better and I knew I couldn‚Äôt fight them. I let them drag me into the back of their truck.¬†



The truck drove to the old circus grounds, long shut down over rumors of gambling and human trafficking.¬†



When I came to my senses, I was on a large wooden stage, staring at my seated parents, the hooded figures, my rough-looking cousins, the nurse with rotten teeth, the conjoined twins who‚Äôd tased me in the clearing, and the bare-chested rednecks, all watching me. I stood there on stage, frightened and in tears. How can my parents do this to me? I‚Äôve always had a good relationship with them. At that moment, I wished more than anything to go back in time, to keep my winnings a secret.¬†



But now, it was too late.



My mother, Grace, addressed me directly. ‚ÄúWire us the money, Jordan. And I promise you this will all be over soon.‚Äù



I stepped to the edge of the stage, my glare cutting through her like a blade. ‚ÄúYou framed me for murders I didn‚Äôt commit. You‚Äôve destroyed my life.‚Äù



They rose from their seats, tambourines in hand, playing with an unsettling enthusiasm. My parents had never touched an instrument in their lives, and I wasn‚Äôt about to stick around to find out what this sudden performance was all about. Without hesitation, I leapt off the stage and bolted toward the big top‚Äîa massive tent draped in bold red and white stripes.¬†



Inside, I found piles of dolls and rows of eerily still mannequins. Heart pounding, I crouched among the clutter, hoping to stay hidden. But I was wrong. Some of the mannequins weren‚Äôt lifeless props. Their eyes snapped open, glinting with life, and before I could react, they lunged at me, dragging me out of the tent toward the animal pens behind a row of ornate fences.



I screamed and struggled to fight them off. The distant sound of tambourine music still echoed through the air. They dragged me to a pen where a sleeping lion lay and shoved me inside, slamming the gate shut behind me. I looked up at the lion as it let out a low groan in its sleep, its massive body beginning to stir. One of the men, dressed unnervingly like a mannequin, pulled out an iPad, and shoved it through the pen.¬†



‚ÄúDirect me to your website‚Äôs bank account,‚Äù he demanded.



I shook my head firmly. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù¬†



The lion‚Äôs eyes fluttered open, staring into my eyes. Holly mother, I was as good as dead.



The beast rose to its feet, towering over me, and leaned in close. Its rough tongue swiped across my sweaty face. I squeezed my teary eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable, but then an odd realization cut through my fear: the circus grounds had been shut down for decades. What were animals still doing here, locked inside cages? And then I wondered? Was any of this even real to begin with? The two dead cops. The lifeless parishioners. The hooded figures in white robes. The bare-chested rednecks. The nurse with rotten teeth. The conjoined twins who had tased me in the forest. And now this circus with caged animals that were closed decades ago. I knew I had been drugged, but maybe it was much worse than that?¬†



My eyes cracked open, meeting the lion‚Äôs unyielding gaze. It tilted its head, then sat back on its haunches. Before I could make sense of it, I noticed something that made my breath catch‚Äîa gold necklace hanging around the lion‚Äôs neck. It looked strikingly similar to the one my mother, Grace, always wore. What an odd coincidence, I thought. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling. I had to be sure. So, I asked a crazy question.



‚ÄúMom? Is that‚Ä¶you?‚Äù



The men in mannequin costumes hissed at each other in hushed tones, their frustration clearly visible. The lion became irritated, slamming itself against the pen.¬†



The men rushed into the pen, restraining me. One of them jabbed a needle into my arm. The world around me dissolved into darkness‚Äîagain.



I woke up, naked, lying in the middle of the street under the cover of night. My mother, Grace, sat eerily still beside me, her eyes closed as if in deep slumber. I staggered to my feet and her eyes cracked open, locking into mine. Her lips parted slowly, unnervingly wide, as she pushed her hand into her mouth. When she pulled it back out, a writhing snake dangled from her grasp.¬†



I screamed and bolted down the street, glancing over my shoulder to see if she followed. I reached a fence and scrambled over it and ran into the woods until the outline of our farmhouse emerged through the darkness. I ran into the main house, climbed up the stairs, found some clothes in my room and suited up.¬†¬†



As I descended the stairs toward the living room, I saw my parents, plus everyone else, seated at the dinner table, each with a cup of coffee in hand, whispering in hushed tones. I joined them in silence, seething, but powerless against my predicament.¬†



Suddenly, they slowly turned their necks toward me, and began speaking in an eerie, guttural language. And that‚Äôs when I remembered. **Witchcraft**. My eyes widened as a memory surfaced‚Äîmy grandmother had dabbled in witchcraft during her teenage years and surely had passed her teachings to my mother. Their words grew louder, dripping with malice. My body betrayed me, blood began to trickle down my scalp, seeped from my nose and poured from my mouth.¬†



And then I wondered? What if this wasn‚Äôt real as I suspected? What if I was a puppet in their dark ritual, controlled through witchcraft?



There was no time to dwell on the thought. My body lifted off the floor, floating helplessly in the air.



‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you what you want. Please, stop! It‚Äôs all yours!‚Äù I cried out.



I dropped like a stone on the floor, grimacing in pain, looking up, seeing their faces twisted in triumph. Their joy was evident, they‚Äôd finally got what they asked for. But they couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. I staggered to my feet with a devious scheme in mind.¬†



One of my cousins slid a note and pen across the table, expecting me to scrawl my bank information. Instead, I gripped the pen and lunged forward, driving it straight into my mother‚Äôs eye. The makeup of the room began to change. The walls shimmered and warped, pulsing as if alive. My family screamed, their voices deafening, as one by one, they vanished from their chairs.



I woke up in the bathroom, my mother lying beside me, unconscious. I jolted upright and scanned the room. My God! My own mother, with the help of my family, had practiced witchcraft on me, to get after the lottery money I‚Äôd won. I walked out of the bathroom, slipped into the hall and started hearing joyful voices.¬†



I looked down and saw my parents seated at the dinner table, plus, the nurse with decaying teeth, the rough-looking cousins, the conjoined twins who‚Äôd tased me, the bare-chested rednecks, and a small crowd of people cloaked in white robes.



I knew there was no way out of here without a bruising fight, but I had no intention of hurting anyone. Desperate for a moment to think, I slipped into hiding in the library‚Äîa small adjacent room. I scanned the shelves, crammed with books and family albums.¬†



My eyes fell on one of the albums, and curiosity got the better of me. I opened it, flipping through the pages. My heart sank. Staring back at me were faces I recognized.¬†



On one page, I saw a photo of myself as a child, standing outside a farmhouse beside a teenage girl with decaying teeth. She bore an uncanny resemblance to the nurse with the rotten smile.¬†



I turned the page, and my stomach churned. The conjoined twins who had tased me were in another photograph, standing next to me and my mother, as if they were a happy couple inside a mechanic shop.¬†



And it didn‚Äôt stop there.¬†¬†



The town‚Äôs sheriff. The two deputies. Even the people in white robes from the dinner table.¬†



And then, there was the last page.¬†



What I saw made me stumble backward, collapsing onto the floor. Recoiling in complete horror and disgust.



It was a photo of me as a newborn.



I was cradled in my mother‚Äôs arms, surrounded by familiar faces. The younger conjoined twins stood proudly at her side. My father, Mark, was there too, along with a crowd of rough-looking teenage cousins and everyone else (sheriff, deputies, parishioners, bare-chested teenagers and younger faces I recognized at the dinner table wearing white robes).¬†



There was a scribble at the bottom of the page:



*Jordan Summers. Welcome to our ever-growing family.*



Silence tore me apart, then the tears came. The horrifying truth settled in‚ÄîI had been born into some twisted, incestuous, religious, redneck nightmare of a family.



There was no time to waste. I had to escape. I opened the door cautiously, but the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs froze me in place. They were heading to the bathroom to check on my mother. I closed the door and rushed to the window.¬†



Outside, an unattended horse stood near the farmhouse entrance, its reins slack. I pushed the window open and slipped onto the roof. The drop below was steep.



I heard a commotion inside‚Äîthey had found my mother.



I jumped. Pain shot through me as I landed hard on the ground, my leg snapping under the impact. I dragged myself to the horse, hauled myself into the saddle, and urged it into a gallop. Through the dense woods, I rode for what felt like hours, not caring where I was going, as long as it was far away from the farmhouse.



I emerged onto a road and followed it until I reached a bus station in the next town. With the last few dollars in my wallet, I bought a one-way ticket to Oregon.¬†



Once there, I started over. I changed my name, my social security number, and opened a new bank account with my hidden wealth. I dyed my hair pink and started wearing nose-rings. I found a small, cheap apartment and lived like a ghost, severing all ties to my family and former life.¬†



I kept my mouth shut and avoided anyone who might pry into my past.



But life had other plans.



I eventually found love, and within a year, Trinity and I were married. We bought a small farmhouse, miles away from the city.



My life was better. Peaceful. But the past never truly left me.



I was scarred forever.



And to those of you wondering if I ever told my wife about the lottery I had won.



A secret is a secret.¬†



I kept it to myself.¬†

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 23rd, 2136*

Celso had been patiently waiting in the workroom, blissfully unaware of the painful conversation I nearly had with Bemlin. My back still hurt and I was still lacking coffee and that ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù was still horribly fresh in my mind, but my mood didn‚Äôt need to spoil yet another thing today.

His ears perked up once we entered. ‚ÄúDid I miss anything fun?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou excited to get started?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course! I‚Äôve been looking forward to it all paw!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I gestured at the computers across the room. ‚ÄúTake your pick. Except for the one Bemlin‚Äôs at.‚Äù

‚ÄúAw‚Ä¶ I was hoping he‚Äôd be willing to share.‚Äù

Bemlin, who‚Äôd taken a seat, did not appear amused. Not that he ever really did anyways, but this seemed like negative amusement. ‚ÄúAre you multilingual?‚Äù

Celso wagged his tail. ‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôm always willing to learn something new! How hard can it possibly be?‚Äù

Bemlin only adjusted himself in his seat. Celso‚Äôs energy was infectiously humorous, almost better than a cup of coffee. I hoped he wouldn‚Äôt be discouraged by Bemlin‚Äôs demeanor. *Or his casually racist remarks that are sure to pop up again.*

I winced. I really should‚Äôve just talked to Bemlin right then. At least we‚Äôd have the entire two-day Christmas vacation to have a conversation, likely the first of an ongoing effort. Keeping an eager Yotul from getting bored was my top priority.

Celso chose a spot and we got to work. We spent the better part of an hour getting the computer and required software set up, which was surprisingly easy yet oddly difficult in places. Language was my biggest worry but the least of an issue, while the seemingly simple task of  getting him access to his workbook had me on the edge of calling IT. Thankfully, that was not required.

‚ÄúYou should see files for each of the plants,‚Äù I said, mirroring his workbook to what I saw on my holopad. ‚ÄúThey have everything you need. Genome, upkeep routines, whatever.‚Äù

‚ÄúThose must be the two with words I‚Äôm scared to pronounce,‚Äù Celso replied, absently shuffling through the workbook.

‚Äú*Arabidopsis thaliana* and, uh‚Ä¶‚Äù I hesitated. Alien species names were the worst things to try and pronounce, even after I practiced. The Federation had set a standard naming scheme, and from what I‚Äôd learned about it, it seemed fairly lackluster compared to what I was used to. Rather than six ranks between domain and species, there were only five, and the organization within them seemed arbitrary, rather than based on purely genetics as it ought to be. And then there was the whole *predator* thing that gave me such a headache I had to stop learning about it. Yay, ecology (rather, the lack thereof).

‚ÄúI‚Äôll guess it‚Äôs pronounced *Vilparze fuliis*,‚Äù Celso said.

‚ÄúThat sounds about right. I trust you more than myself,‚Äù I chuckled. ‚ÄúAnyways, they‚Äôre from Earth and Venlil Prime respectively. I also put some videos and readings on both plants for you to reference. Once you‚Äôre done with those, I think you should be good to run an experiment.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of experiment?‚Äù

I had a loose plan in my head, built up from work I‚Äôd already done on Earth. ‚ÄúThe first thing I have in mind is creating some gene knockouts and knockins. Preferably sooner than later because the calluses take a while to develop.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should probably admit that I haven‚Äôt done any genetic modification experiments,‚Äù he said, taking on a somewhat bashful look.

I waved a hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy. The proteins involved have been engineered so well in the past century, getting them to do what you want is just a matter of dispensing the right volume in the right place.‚Äù

That didn‚Äôt seem to comfort him. ‚ÄúAre you sure? I don‚Äôt want to mess anything up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do perfectly fine. You‚Äôve got at least five years of solid technique under your belt. And I probably shouldn‚Äôt say this, but budget isn‚Äôt a huge issue. The UN and VR dumped a huge amount of money on this place, and we‚Äôre at the fun part of the process where basically anything gets approved. Don‚Äôt tell Nalek I said that. Or Su Hui.‚Äù

Celso snickered. ‚ÄúMy snout is sealed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyways, the procedures are easy. You can just review them on your computer and transfer them to your holopad and bring it with you into the lab.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy holopad,‚Äù said Celso with just a hint of overtone.

I frowned. ‚ÄúOh, right. I didn‚Äôt entirely forget, but I sort of ran into an issue. Nalek said the entire loaner stock is used up on the others downstairs. Don‚Äôt know how or why, but I can‚Äôt do anything about it. An order has been out since a few paws ago, but I don‚Äôt know when that‚Äôs going to get here.‚Äù

His ears fell, but immediately perked back up. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine! As long as I can do my job, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm expecting it won‚Äôt take too long, but it‚Äôll definitely be a bit of a hassle to work around for now. Nothing pen or paper won‚Äôt solve.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make do until then. If anything, I‚Äôll work harder. I‚Äôm nothing if not committed!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo need to butter me up with words,‚Äù I said, a little harsher than I meant. ‚ÄúYou already got the job, right?‚Äù

He flicked his ears. ‚ÄúOf course! So, gene knockouts and knockins. How do we make that happen?‚Äù

The entire process was surprisingly simple if you ignored the century of development it took to get where it was. It essentially took a heavily engineered CRISPR-derived programmable protein, the relevant DNA of choice, some species-specific genetic modulators to upregulate homologous recombination while downregulating non-homologous end joining, and a vector delivery method.

As much as I would‚Äôve loved to explain every intricate detail to Celso, he didn‚Äôt seem to have much experience with genetic modification, so I decided to keep it simple. ‚ÄúYou just mix some proteins and DNA together and shoot it into your plant with a gene gun.‚Äù

‚ÄúA gene gun?‚Äù Bemlin looked up from his screen for the first time in a while, all the way from across the room.

I raised an eyebrow behind my mask. ‚ÄúYeah. What about it?‚Äù

The geneticist wagged a claw. ‚ÄúI am still not accustomed to how humans‚Ä¶ name things.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh whatever, this one isn‚Äôt even violent. It literally shoots genes into a cell. You guys aren‚Äôt familiar with biolistics?‚Äù

Celso gave me a funny look. ‚ÄúParticle bombardment?‚Äù

I wondered what his translator was doing. ‚ÄúSure, if you want to be boring. You should both look up a water gun. I‚Äôm sure the firewall wouldn‚Äôt block that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou turned water into ammunition?‚Äù Celso remarked. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so cool!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not‚Ä¶‚Äù But it was. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ look it up. It‚Äôs not what it sounds like.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will add it to my list,‚Äù said Bemlin.

I turned my attention back to Celso. ‚ÄúAnyways, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll be doing. Sounds fun, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery,‚Äù he agreed. ‚ÄúWhen can I get started on it?‚Äù

I did some quick math. ‚ÄúTwo days, which is‚Ä¶ two and a half, effectively three paws. I guess this is where I mention that I‚Äôm going on a short Christmas vacation, and so is Bemlin. No big deal.‚Äù

His expression wavered. ‚ÄúI could get it started next paw. Or even this paw! I don‚Äôt mind staying late at all.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to ask that you stay late, let alone so soon after starting. Oh, uh, if you‚Äôre worried about getting time in for pay, don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre in *my* lab, which means you get all the good stuff that goes with it. That is to say, you‚Äôll get holiday pay for the next three paws.‚Äù

I expected a more positive reaction. Instead, as best I could tell, he looked somewhat conflicted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ sure? It wouldn‚Äôt be an issue for me at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúBe careful what you wish for, Celso. Some people wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to take advantage of you. Just take a few to relax. The last thing I want is for this new job to be stressful for you, or any of us, really. Enjoy the surprise vacation.‚Äù

Somehow, he still didn‚Äôt appear convinced. That offensive video kept creeping back, as much as I wanted to ignore it. I quietly cleared my throat.

‚ÄúUh, anyways. Just do what you can right now, and we‚Äôll pick up some momentum once we get back.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Yeah!‚Äù His energy suddenly returned. ‚ÄúSounds great!‚Äù

I frowned behind my mask. There it was again, that tiny break in composure that I couldn‚Äôt quite place a finger on. As much as I wanted to do so much more for him, I tried not to let the horrible video impact my decisions. He seemed fine, so I left him to it.

I returned to my office and turned on my computer to about three dozen emails. I pulled off my mask and heaved a sigh.

Two of them were from Nalek. He copied me on emails to both Acetli and Tanerik, the two Venlil I'd decided to hire. He asked them how soon they could start and if they‚Äôd be willing to show up for a half-shift when I got back from my short vacation.

They both had already replied, and it looked like I‚Äôd see them first thing after my short vacation. I almost got excited, but caught myself. It was a mistake to look forward to anything in this galaxy, especially after this terrible morning-not-morning.

One of the emails was from Bemlin, 31 minutes ago, informing me that he thinks he figured out the introns to the mystery gene. He‚Äôd attached some files which I downloaded for later. *I desperately need to get some actual computational work done.* I sent back an acknowledgement.

There were another four emails from Rosim, the bundle of nerves who tried to talk with me earlier. The first one asked me for details regarding the mystery gene, and the subsequent three each requested a meeting time with me with increasingly self-doubting wording. Poor guy. I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was intimidated by the scary predator or just generally nervous. At least he was persistent.

I sent him a reply with some loose information about the discovery and my general plans moving forward. I also told him I‚Äôd be able to meet the claw I got back to work and my schedule.

Not even five minutes later, he responded. It seemed like I had some sort of board meeting to look forward to now. Great. What fun. It could probably be somewhat useful to Acetli and Tanerik, at least.

Another email was from Su Hui. She was just letting me know that her departure from the Arxur station went well. She had the luxury of going to Earth for her Christmas vacation, and it was also longer than mine. Not that I really minded. Most of my material possessions on Earth were gone, which included my apartment in Los Angeles, which included my 4-foot (curse you, America) plastic Christmas tree.

What I did own was whatever I‚Äôd taken with me to the refugee camp, which was little more than a few suitcases. And that place and everything I‚Äôd done there was probably already forgotten. A shorter vacation was better, honestly.

Uneager to dwell in the past, I opened up some old code I developed (largely copied from some Git page) that was way back from my grad school days. In the future I‚Äôd probably look for some recent open-source technology paper‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt like there was *any* shortage of those recently‚Äîbut that could wait for when we were more confident in the seemingly hidden gene. I skimmed through it. Other than some horrible formatting choices, it seemed that the search was based on start/stop codon distances, promoter sequences, and some other questionable choices I couldn‚Äôt fathom the reasoning behind. It was basically what Bemlin had done by hand, only a million times faster.

It was missing a proper statistical analysis and a results printout, though‚Äîthe only part of any computational work that was worth anything. So I did what any efficient (lazy) person would do and made a language model fill in the pieces.

My eyes glazed over several times while working, due in part to my lack of caffeine. But it was calming. Made it easy to zone out, ignore everything else. I ran it on the human chromosome 1 at least a dozen times (and those were just the attempts that didn‚Äôt throw up some syntax error. Thanks, semicolons) until it was to a point I was decently happy with.

I was ready to try it on the Gojid genome, but I immediately hit a snag. I‚Äôd never managed to convert the genome file into something my code could work with. I messaged Bemlin for assistance.

He replied quickly. Rather than some instructions on what he did to get the genome workable, he sent the entire genome in a *text file*.

Smiling dumbly, I downloaded it and passed it through some UN software (which actually *worked* this time) to get the file into a format I could use. I adjusted some parameters in my code to limit what it would search to just the first chromosome. I ran it just to see what would happen.

To some surprise, it detected a whopping three genes with passable confidence. Three human ‚Äúgenes‚Äù with human codons and human promoter sequences in a Gojid genome. I messaged Bemlin my findings. Maybe he‚Äôd find it funny.

I started a new code branch and searched for the Gojid equivalents to the human sequences. Replacing them was easy enough.

The new code was in the middle of running when Bemlin popped his head in. ‚ÄúWhy are you claiming to have found human genes in the Gojid genome?‚Äù

I smirked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not. My code is, and with very low confidence.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have code?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just some old stuff I half-made half-copied from some random page like, a decade ago.‚Äù

He came around the side of my desk and inspected my screen. ‚ÄúI did not know you could code.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúIs it that big of a surprise? Anything to do with bioinformatics is pretty big on this sort of stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never had any motivation to learn something like that. I suppose the curriculums on Earth are quite different.‚Äù

I frowned. Something about what he said bothered me. Was the Federation‚Äôs grip on genetic analysis software so tight that the only thing used in the galaxy was KeiVei-Lay? How did they discover new genes? *Or do they ever discover new genes‚Ä¶? There‚Äôs something more to this.*

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù Bemlin said, ‚ÄúI must assume your code is not great if it found human genes in the wrong genome.‚Äù

I saved my suspicions for later, and gave him a look. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm offended. My code is *great*, thank you very much. I ran it on human parameters just to see what would happen. Let‚Äôs look at what an actual analysis looks like.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is your AI code?‚Äù Bemlin asked.

‚ÄúMade with AI, kind of, but the program itself isn‚Äôt. Basically just a regex match with some extra statistical parameters and confidence score ratings built in.‚Äù

Bemlin appeared confused, but did not pursue it. We waited another moment for the progress to tick over, and the results flashed.

1,298 genes. 53% of them had over 90% confidence. That was a *surprisingly good* number and somewhat believable if compared to a human chromosome.

‚ÄúBemlin, do you know how many genes are on your first chromosome?‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe it is about three-thousand-eight-hundred, give or take.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow.‚Äù I sat back in my chair, a stupid grin on my face. ‚Äú*Wow!* This is awesome! This went *so* much better than I thought it would.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe results are promising?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! It works on this program, even just a little bit. It‚Äôs filled with errors but, for a proof of concept, this went *great!*‚Äù

Bemlin brought out his holopad for what I assumed was to translate my screen. He looked at the results, and did not appear impressed. ‚ÄúIt underestimated the number of genes by nearly three-quarters.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know! Isn‚Äôt that great? It could have been so much worse. I should also mention it‚Äôs not taking into account non-coding genes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose that makes it slightly better. But how is this going to help us? Your program‚Äôs accuracy leaves something to be desired.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it means we don‚Äôt have to rely on KeiVei-Lay. Peer-review of your genome, if you will. We can actually search the genome using something I created. Which means it can be put through something I didn‚Äôt create. *Which means* we can use a proper AI on this thing. Although I want to check that at least some of the genes are present on the main assembly in KeiVei-Lay. Do you think you could send me a CSV file with a list of genes and their locations on the genome?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you expect me to do that manually?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt KeiVei-Lay have some kind of function to just spit out a gene‚Äôs information? The only thing I really need are the exact locations in the genome. Can you select more than one at a time?‚Äù

He thought for a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ believe I can do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat! Get at least a few hundred from the first chromosome as soon as you can. I‚Äôm going to find an *actual* program. And throw a language model at it, too. After this first test, we‚Äôre going to *really* pick apart the genome. Oh! And Acetli and Tanerik are going to be here by then! This is going to be great.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat of the first gene I found? What are you planning now that I sorted out the introns?‚Äù

Thoughts were rushing past faster than I could grab onto them. ‚ÄúI have plans for that. So many plans for so many things. I need to write all this down.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo not think too hard,‚Äù Bemlin said, somewhat amused with himself.

I gave him a look. ‚ÄúOh, really?‚Äù

The sly Gojid slipped out of my office without saying another word.

It was an impossible task to not give him the satisfaction of hearing my laugh. Shaking my head, I opened my notes and began typing. I spent a while setting up a very loose timeline, which also reminded me that I needed to do the same for the plant project.

And as if summoned by my very thought, Celso peeked inside my office with a polite knock.

I slipped on my mask. ‚ÄúHey! Feeling good about things?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù he enthused. ‚ÄúThe more I read and watch, the more things are coming together for me. There‚Äôs just one small thing I thought I should mention.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, what have you got?‚Äù

His tail dipped in what I guessed was shame. ‚ÄúI know you said not to stay late, but I think it‚Äôs a little past time. Like I said, I‚Äôm fine with staying late, I just thought I would let you know.‚Äù

I stared at the clock and blinked several times. We were half an hour past. I‚Äôd forgotten how much time coding seemed to inexplicably suck up. And of course, Bemlin hadn‚Äôt said anything. ‚ÄúOh, shoot, uh‚Ä¶ Sorry about that. Go home.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

I stood up. ‚ÄúAbsolutely positive. In fact, I would‚Äôve preferred you told me sooner.‚Äù I walked past Celso and stuck my head into the workroom. ‚ÄúBemlin, do you know it‚Äôs past time?‚Äù

He looked at me, then his monitor. ‚ÄúI do now.‚Äù

I turned back to Celso in the hallway, sticking a thumb at the Gojid. ‚ÄúYou can blame him. Anyways, yeah‚Äîgo home. Enjoy the time off. Anything you need from me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! Is there anything you want me to work on or review during the break?‚Äù

I frowned. At this point, Celso‚Äôs apparent need to impress me was a little more than just noticeable. I really hoped it could be dismissed as new job woes, and not something related to‚Ä¶ perceived social standing.

It also didn‚Äôt help that I wanted to spill my heart out and apologize for everything this cruel galaxy did to his planet. But that probably wouldn‚Äôt go over well.

‚ÄúDefinitely not,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhatever you managed to do this paw was probably already more than enough. Work-life balance is important, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course! I just wasn‚Äôt sure if humans did things differently.‚Äù

I snorted. ‚ÄúIt seems we do a lot of things differently. Actually, you should let *me* know if there‚Äôs anything I can do to accommodate you. I‚Äôm, um, a little unaware when it comes to other species.‚Äù *To a horrendous degree, evidently.*

If he appeared confused, it vanished before I could say for certain. ‚ÄúIs accommodating others one of your customs?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ maybe?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome predators you are,‚Äù he said with faux annoyance. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the fun in working here if you aren‚Äôt even going to do anything terrible?‚Äù

Celso was a menace, I decided. ‚ÄúActually, I know an old grad school advisor who kept a sleeping bag and pillow in the student workroom. I should introduce you to him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, calm down, I was joking,‚Äù he said with a wag to his tail.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought. Now get out of here. You showed up early and left late, which isn‚Äôt how a first shift should go. I‚Äôm looking forward to getting some work done in a few paws.‚Äù

Celso said his goodbyes and grabbed his satchel to leave. I loved how it looked, from the intricate pattern on the strap to the metal brass buckles. I'd have to ask him where he got it.

I did some last minute things on my computer before shutting down for the day. Bemlin and I headed out together.

‚ÄúHow was this paw?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúDid it get better after‚Ä¶ whatever happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoding is somewhat relaxing. You know, I thought I didn‚Äôt need this short break at all. Now, I‚Äôm not so sure. One last bit of freedom before we jump off the deep end, I guess.‚Äù

He nodded, which was oddly comforting to see. ‚ÄúThings are sure to pick up with the two you hired. What about that fellow Rosim? I received an email from him about a board meeting when we get back.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh jeez, I almost forgot about that already. I hope you‚Äôre ready to argue with a bunch of scientists‚Äîthe worst kind of people to argue with.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so dreary. Perhaps it will be insightful for all involved.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúAnyways. You know any good takeout places around here? I‚Äôm starving.‚Äù

1h0lj92,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h0lj92/firsttime_buyer_space_budget/,"First-Time Buyer [Space, Budget]","Hi, good folks of r/espresso. I'm sure holiday gift buyers like me are somewhat annoying here, so I will get right to the point:

My wife really wants an espresso maker and has for some time. I want to make her happy and buy one for Christmas. I am already something of a coffee guy. I buy special beans, grind them at home (have both electric and hand grinders), regulate my water temperature--that kind of stuff.

But I have never made espresso, and when I look for advice online, I find the lists and discussions (even here!) extremely confusing. Lots of words I'm unfamiliar with, part names, just confounding stuff.  
  
Everything that is even somewhat reasonably priced seems to be a knock-off that, I'm told, will immediately break. Even the mostly well-liked machines seem to have their critics (but for reasons I can never quite figure out. But I know nothing about espresso. So they may be important!).

What matters most to me is space. We live in an old house with a small kitchen. Ideally, it'll fit in there. The second thing that matters to me is price. I don't want to buy something that will break immediately. But I can't afford to spend $800 on a single gadget.

What do you recommend for first-time users that isn't gargantuan and that isn't a zillion dollars? I'm not looking for all the bells and whistles, just something that will bring my wife some Christmas cheer. A good beginner machine.",1,1732651989.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
