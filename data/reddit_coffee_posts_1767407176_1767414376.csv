The Lexus is full for once.

Peanuts at the wheel.
Becca riding shotgun.
Lily in the back, knees drawn up, a Baduk manual open on her lap even as the car moves.

Peanuts is being merciful.

She does **not** rub the midterms in Becca’s face.

She doesn’t need to.

Becca already looks like someone who survived a natural disaster by technically being indoors.

Instead, they’re fighting about television.

“I’m tellin’ you,” Peanuts says, jabbing the steering wheel for emphasis, “*Friends* is perfect. It’s got jokes, it’s got outfits, it’s got neurotic Jews and dumb pretty people, what more do you want from America?”

Becca scoffs. “It’s empty calories. It’s a laugh track wrapped around six narcissists and a sofa. There is not a single consequence in that show.”

Peanuts grins. “Yeah, that’s why it’s good.”

Lily doesn’t hear any of it.

She’s replaying sequences on the page.
Invasions. Reductions. Endgame sente chains.
Meowna patterns.
Hikaru’s pressure.
Lucky Dave’s suffocation.

Her life has collapsed into sixty-four intersections.

The school appears without warning at the end of a hill:

**Nathan Bedford Forrest Middle School**
Brick. Wide lawns. Flag snapping in the wind like it’s being graded.

The most prestigious school in Oconee County.

Peanuts pulls up to the curb.

Lily already knows what’s coming.

Mail arrived last week.

An official letter.
Stiff paper.
Big words.

A **full scholarship offer**:

* For her Baduk talent
* And for the prestige attached to her pet Catgirl being a nuclear engineer
* And for “contributing indirectly” to multiple Nobel-adjacent research programs

She thinks it’s a complete waste of time.

School won’t make her stronger.

Pro status will.

She doesn’t plan on coming back after she turns pro anyway. She’ll just drop out, grind Go, take the GED later. Nobody will stop her. Nobody will even argue.

Not like her parents care what she does.

But Peanuts did something underhanded.

She went full Catgirl.

Big eyes. Soft voice. Fake vulnerability.
The ultimate biological weapon.

And Lily folded instantly.

So here she is.

The Lexus stops.

Peanuts looks over her shoulder. “Interview only. In. Out. No contracts, no blood oaths.”

Lily opens the door.

And steps out.

---

Good—this is the collision of *institutional ambition* with *private recalibration*. I’ll keep Lewis oily, Lily silent, and stop **exactly** where you stop.

---

Lily walks into the building.

Polished floors. Trophy cases that smell faintly like lemon cleaner and ambition. Framed photos of smiling children holding banners that say things like *District Champions* and *Future Leaders of America*. It’s clean in the way only places with budgets get to be clean.

She’s escorted into an office that looks like every principal’s office in America:
motivational posters, a framed state flag, a coffee mug that says *World’s Best Administrator* without irony.

Principal Lewis sits behind the desk.

Same smile as on the flyers. The kind that arrives before the truth does.

“Well now,” he says warmly, folding his hands. “It’s not often a middle school gets a Baduk prodigy walking through its doors.”

He slides a thin folder across the desk. “Full scholarship. Tuition covered. Equipment covered. Tournament travel handled.”

Lily doesn’t touch it.

But she understands immediately.

This isn’t altruism.

This is recruitment.

He wants her on the school Baduk team. Wants her locked into their uniform, their banners, their win column. Wants to turn her into a championships machine they can brag about at PTA meetings.

She doesn’t resent him for it.

She just finds it… small.

School championships are child’s play.
Her goal is national titles.
International circuits.
Satellite tournaments in cities whose names don’t fit in one mouth.
Before eighteen.

For a while, she’d been arrogant enough to think that path was inevitable.

Destroying pros twice her age will do that to you.

But Hikaru cracked something in that certainty.

Not by overpowering her.

By making her realize how narrow her assumptions had been.

She’s quieter now inside.

More grounded.

Principal Lewis studies her with narrowed eyes.

“You know,” he says, nodding sagely, “true champions are often the humblest. You don’t even see yourself as good, do you?”

She says nothing.

He smiles wider. “Modesty. That’s the mark of the greats.”

He stands. “Tell you what—our semester tournament is running right now. Three boards per team. Why don’t you watch a round? Get a feel for the culture here.”

She follows him down the hallway.

The gym is already loud—shoes on wood, voices bouncing, the familiar tension of kids trying to act casual around something that matters too much.

Three tables are set up at the center.
Digital clocks ticking.
Referees with clipboards.
Parents whispering like they’re in church.

Lily scans the boards.

Sees safe openings.
Overextensions.
Unrepaired aji.
Endgame blunders being silently rehearsed in advance.

And then—

At the third board—

She sees **Hikaru** sitting in a school chair, sleeves rolled up, arguing with no one at all while staring at the grid.

---

Lily almost walks past the board.

What stops her isn’t noise or chaos.

It’s the opposite.

The position is *settled*—the kind of stillness that only exists late in a game, when everything important has already happened and all that remains is quiet surgery. The board is breathing slowly. Evenly. No loose stones. No screaming weak groups.

Hikaru is sitting at the far side, playing **White**.

Across from him is a boy she doesn’t recognize—maybe a mid-level insei by posture alone. The way his shoulders lean forward gives him away. He’s trying to *force* the board to agree with him instead of listening to it.

They don’t notice her.

The game is deep in **yose**.

Pure endgame.

No more strategy. No more vision. Just point shaving along the seams of territory where one mistake costs the entire result.

Lily takes one look and knows it’s already over.

Not because of any single blunder.

Because White controls every exchange.

Hikaru plays a small **sente** endgame move on the left side—a quiet boundary **hane** between settled territory and shared space. It’s not flashy. Just correct. Two guaranteed points and forcing.

The boy answers instantly.

Too fast.

Reflex, not reading.

Lily’s stomach tightens.

He didn’t even stop to verify whether it was actually sente.

Hikaru follows with a clean **clamp**. That tiny exchange unfolds into a full sequence: two points here, three there, sente preserved, initiative never released for even a moment.

Lily watches the points move the way a doctor watches blood through an IV—slow, steady, unstoppable.

This isn’t fighting.

This is accounting.

She studies the board backward, reconstructing the earlier phases from the fossil record of the stones.

Black must have claimed corners early—solid territorial confidence.

White answered not with direct attack but with **thickness**. Outside strength that never immediately killed anything, but quietly suffocated every future option.

No weak groups anywhere.

No floating stones.

No unresolved **aji**.

No lingering cuts.

Every fight must have ended cleanly.

He never let the game become unstable.

He never let the boy feel lost.

He just narrowed the world a little at a time.

The boy makes one last try.

A shallow corner **endgame probe**, hoping for two pity points if the boundary is imperfect.

Against a tired opponent, it might work.

Hikaru answers without hesitation.

One move.

Then another.

Then a final placement that snaps the shape shut like a door locking from the inside.

Airtight.

No ko.

No follow-up.

No aji left behind at all.

Black loses four more points in one breath—and with it, every remaining threat on the board evaporates.

Lily exhales without realizing she was holding her breath.

*That wasn’t defense,* she thinks.
*That was mercy done with perfect geometry.*

The boy stares at the board for a long time.

Longer than frustration.

Longer than denial.

Then his breathing changes.

His shoulders start to shake.

He tips his king stone forward.

“I resign.”

His voice cracks.

And when Lily expects anger, she sees tears instead—full, uncontrolled, spilling straight onto the floor.

He bows again and again, too fast, almost frantic.

“Thank you,” he says between breaths. “Thank you for the game.”

Lily understands instantly.

He isn’t crying because he lost.

He’s crying because he just saw something he didn’t think he was allowed to see.

A game with no wasted motion.

No cruelty.

No uncertainty.

Just inevitability.

Hikaru finally notices Lily watching.

But he can tell—without a word—that she thought the game was beautiful.

In her silence, he can tell she is apologizing to him for running from him.

And promising—

without sound—

that she will never back down.

1q2kp2k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2kp2k,Paid Coffee date gone wrong.,"So basically i provide paid services to female who have no friends or want to experience something different and I'm Male 25 delhi.

And she was extremely gorgeous woman who is in their late 30's  i have ever met.

She is a professor from DU in psychology.
And damn what was her sense of humor and the way she was explaining things and also I was very shocked the way she was understanding through my expressions.

So I have got booking from one of my client for a coffee date because she was like when I'll find you nice then I'll think about it and then we decided to meet at blue tokai CP.

And when we met we were just talking casually and our sitting arrangement was face to face.

And now we started talking about life loneliness and about the relationships how it's going now a days, workout pollution and bla bla....

Then I asked about her intrests in men.
Then she explained several things which was unique and I guess I should say I'm kinda similar person which one she wants then she offered me a  couch and Said let's sit together I was like sure why not .

Then we had Convo on few more topics which was related to sex .

And I charged her 1899rs for a coffee date where we will meet and hang out together and I'll treat her like a caring boyfriend and she was like this thing is much needed in my life .

Then I was like okay lets doo this

Then we were in the coffee shop for about more than 2hrs and I don't know somehow she convinced me to have sex and I don't know why I was going with the flow i wasn't ready for sex cause I had 5 round of sex last to last night and just next day I'm getting again se I was like noo way bruhh.

Then she knows a place those who don't know there is place in North campus where couples do such kind of activities well.

Then we put sunshades on the window and reached at that location and started kissing on my lips and on my neck and she was like I donywant paid sex would you like to be my fuck buddy ?

I don't know why I said yes 🙂‍↕️?

But then we had a moment inside her car and she dropped me at metro station and then  I was thinking bro what was that and why you did this shit I gave her a free service.

1q2koi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1q2koi6/question_regarding_dog_nausea_and_other/,Question Regarding Dog Nausea and Other,"So about four days ago, my 2 year old germqn shepherd mix vomited his food. Before this, he went out and started eating grass like crazy. This is not normal behavior for him. He has done so once per day since, minus the grass eating. Have had him on a bland diet of chicken and rice for the last 48 hours or so. The puking has slowed down since the bland diet change, however, he just vomited up some bile. This would be his first time puking in about that same 48 hours. He tried to eat a little grass when I took him out to try to get him to poop afterwards. 

However, he hasn't pooped in about 30 hours at this point. No attempts to poop. Doesn't act like he has to poop at all. 

He is getting around a cup of food, twice per day. In the last 36 hours, it has been 2 parts cooked rice and one part shredded plain chicken breast. 

Treating has been bare minimal, maybe a pinch of the cooked chicken or two, two or three times a day. I also gave him maybe a quarter teaspoon of peanut butter once, rubbed around inside of his kong. 

He has always had a pissy stomach, which basically equated to having really loose stools and pooping in multiple places to fully evacuate his bowels. 

We put him on probiotics for this. Initially Purina Proplan Fortiflora, as given by vet. This firmed his stools up well. When we ran out, we switched to a different one to try them, which were chews. They didn't work as well so after about two months, we switched back to the fortiflora. This was about a week ago. Firmed his stools up well again. 

Since he started puking, he pooped normally for the first couple of days until he last pooped, again, about 30 hours ago. 

Otherwise, he acts perfectly normal. He plays like crazy during the day and sleeps well all night. 

He is drinking less water than normal, but I have also been keeping him from playing quite so hard since he started throwing up. Most of his normal heavy water consumption comes after hard play with his brother, so it's not TERRIBLY abnormal that he is drinking less water. His brother is also drinking less water and acting perfectly normal. 

He is VORACIOUSLY hungry. He'd eat anything I'd be willing to feed him and this has been consistent all throughout the episode. 

He has no bloating in his belly. He has no tenderness. I can't feel any tightness anywhere. Even pushing on his stomach area pretty hard doesn't elicit any reaction beyond his wondering what I'm doing and trying to get me to scratch his butt.

Any ideas about what might be going on here? Or any advice on dealing with it?

Naturally, it happened at the holidays and we haven't been able to get into any of the vets locally. We are calling his vet first thing tomorrow morning to try to get him in ASAP and we are ready and able to get him to the emergency vet if he suddenly takes a down turn. 

I'm just trying to get some ideas from people who know as to what may be going on here, especially if anyone else has experienced this. 

Also, gums are pink and not tacky/sticky at all. 

His ears have bugged him pretty badly for a few minutes here or there during this time period, but this is nothing new. We've dealt with his ear itching issues for his whole life. 

No blood or anything in his vomit. Nothing resembling coffee grounds. Just kibble (Taste of the Wild, Salmon) that is about 95% broken down, so brown moderately lumpy goo. No visible blood or discoloration of his stool. 

The only food related changes/oddities I can think of are, A) the change back to the Fortiflora powdered probiotics and, B) before he started puking, we gave him a fairly large amount of tillamook white cheddar cheese cubes. Maybe 2 to 4 ounces, cubed, over the course of a couple of days. My wife and I didn't realize the other was giving him cheese, so he got way more than we would have given him otherwise. He has had zero cheese since a couple of hours prior to the first vomiting episode. They have always been given the cheese tax, which typically is a healthy pinch of shredded cheese if we cook with any. 

He has always been on the lazier side. He MIGHT be slightly more likely to lay around for the last few days but isn't visibly weak or lethargic. He acts 99% like himself. 

He is two years old. Weighs around 70lbs. No meds save for the pro/prebiotics as mentioned. 

They do get salmon oil sprayed on their kibble. Have had none since bland diet started. 

Again, any ideas or advice here beyond go the vet are appreciated. That is already in the works but the holiday made it difficult. 

Thank you so much in advance. ",1,1767413608.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False
1q2kohh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shinokiba_Chatgpt/comments/1q2kohh/the_hunt_for_the_nautilus_part_3_submarine_cold/,The Hunt for the Nautilus. Part 3. Submarine Cold War Story. (FINAL),"### Chapter 11 — Surfacing (CHASE)

The first order felt absurd the moment Keeman gave it.

“Prepare to surface.”

No one questioned it.

The *Hornett* had been hovering above the light for hours, neither advancing nor retreating, the pressure modulation beneath them steady as a held breath. The invitation had not withdrawn. It had simply *waited*.

“Blow main ballast,” Keeman said. “Controlled ascent.”

“Aye, sir.”

Compressed air roared softly through the tanks. The deck tilted almost imperceptibly as the submarine began to rise, the Pacific brightening around them as filtered daylight replaced black.

“Contact still beneath us,” Harris reported. “Matching ascent.”

Keeman nodded. “Of course it is.”

At periscope depth, Keeman took the scope himself. He rotated slowly, methodically.

The ocean was calm. Too calm. A wide, glassy swell under a pale blue sky, the sun already high enough to wash detail from the horizon. No ships. No aircraft. Nothing that should have been watching.

He swung the scope again.

And froze.

Below the surface, something vast moved upward—not fast, not aggressively, but with the certainty of mass that had never needed to hurry. The water above it distorted, not foaming, not breaking, simply *lifting*.

“Conn,” Keeman said, voice steady despite the weight in his chest, “we’re coming up together.”

The *Hornett* broke the surface with a muted rush of water, diesel exhaust coughing briefly into the air before settling. Hatches clanged open. Fresh air flooded compartments that had forgotten its smell.

Keeman climbed to the bridge.

The first thing he noticed was the silence.

No gulls. No wind. Even the ocean seemed to hesitate.

Then the sea to starboard rose.

Not a breach—nothing violent. The water swelled outward, rolling aside as if displaced by something that refused to tear it. A curved, dark surface emerged, shedding water in smooth sheets that glinted in the sun.

Metal.

Not corroded. Not patched. Dark, matte, seamless. The hull was not cylindrical in the way modern submarines were, but elongated and organic, shaped by hydrodynamics rather than shipyard convention. No sail. No visible screws. No control surfaces that Keeman could identify.

Just form.

Length estimates flashed uselessly through his mind and were discarded. It was bigger than *Hornett*. Not massively so—but undeniably.

“Jesus Christ,” someone breathed behind him.

The Nautilus surfaced completely and then stopped.

It sat low in the water, balanced, perfectly at ease. The sea lapped against it without protest.

Keeman scanned instinctively for markings.

There were none.

No flag. No numbers. No language.

Only one detail broke the smoothness: a seam near the forward third of the hull, circular, precise.

A hatch.

“Captain,” Harris said quietly from behind him, having climbed up without Keeman noticing, “Soviet contact remains submerged. They’ve surfaced sonar buoy only. No approach.”

Keeman nodded. “They’re not invited.”

As if in acknowledgment, a faint ripple crossed the Nautilus’ hull—not sound, not vibration, but pressure Keeman felt in his chest rather than his ears.

The seam shifted.

The hatch opened.

Not explosively. Not with hydraulics screaming. It rotated outward with controlled inevitability, water spilling from the interior in a clear, continuous sheet.

Inside was darkness.

No figures emerged. No weapons. No threat displays.

Just an open aperture, large enough for a man to pass through.

The *Hornett* drifted slightly closer under minimal power, waves nudging steel against steel at a respectful distance. The contrast was stark—painted Navy gray beside something that seemed to have never needed paint at all.

Keeman removed his cap without realizing he was doing it.

Behind them, unseen but unmistakably present, the Soviet submarine remained below, listening, recording, understanding that history was happening just beyond its reach.

The Nautilus did not signal again.

It did not beckon.

It did not explain.

It simply remained surfaced, hatch open, in full daylight, unhidden for the first time in living memory.

Consent had been granted.

The next move—Keeman understood with absolute clarity—would have to be human.

---

They crossed first out of habit, not courage.

Chief Engineer Mallory led the way, one hand on the line, boots slipping slightly as he stepped from the *Hornett*’s deck onto the Nautilus’ hull. He paused immediately, stamping once, then again—testing.

“Steel,” he muttered. “Solid as hell.”

No hollow echo. No vibration. It felt… *anchored*.

Behind him, two sailors followed, then another engineer. No one spoke loudly. Voices carried oddly here, as if the air above the Nautilus didn’t like being disturbed.

The hatch yawned open, edges machined with a precision that didn’t match anything Mallory knew from the 1800s—or the 1900s, for that matter.

“Watch your step,” he said automatically.

They entered.

The interior lighting was low but present—not electric in any recognizable way, but steady, white, shadowless. The air was cool, dry, faintly metallic, with an undercurrent of something organic—wood oil, perhaps.

Someone behind him whispered, “This is impossible.”

Mallory ignored it and moved forward.

The corridor walls were ribbed metal, dark and smooth, unmarred by corrosion. No rust blooms. No flaking paint. No repairs. No patchwork.

“Captain,” one of the engineers said into his radio, voice tight, “there’s no degradation. None. This hull should’ve been dust fifty years ago.”

Keeman’s voice came back calm, distant. “Understood. Continue.”

They passed machinery next—massive flywheel assemblies, pressure cylinders, linkages that looked Victorian in concept but alien in execution. Brass, steel, something darker that absorbed light instead of reflecting it.

“No wiring,” Mallory said, crouching. “No insulation. No electric motors.”

“How the hell did it move?” a sailor asked.

Mallory shook his head slowly. “I don’t know.”

They reached the control room.

It stopped them cold.

A table sat at the center—polished wood, inlaid metal. Place settings for six.

Plates. Cutlery. Crystal glasses.

A meal.

Untouched.

One engineer reached out instinctively, then froze. “Sir… permission?”

Mallory nodded numbly.

The engineer touched the edge of a plate, then pulled his hand back sharply.

“Cold,” he said. “But not stale. Not… old.”

Another leaned closer, sniffed. “That was cooked today. Maybe a few hours ago.”

Silence fell hard.

There was no dust on the table. No cobwebs. No decay. The chairs were pulled out slightly, as if diners had just risen.

A sailor swallowed. “Where the fuck did they go?”

They searched.

Crew quarters: empty. Bunks neatly made. Personal effects present—boots, coats, notebooks. Nothing packed. Nothing abandoned in panic.

Engine spaces: immaculate. No soot. No leaks. No signs of human labor fatigue.

Storage rooms: stocked. Carefully rationed. Labeled.

One compartment stopped them again.

“Logs,” an ensign said softly.

Shelves of bound books. Thick paper. Handwritten.

Mallory picked one up carefully, like it might crumble.

It didn’t.

The pages were dense with script—precise, flowing, utterly unfamiliar.

“What language is that?” someone asked.

“I don’t know,” Mallory said. “But look—dates.”

He flipped pages.

“1859… 1863… 1870…”

He stopped.

“1874,” he said.

The next page was blank.

No later entries. No addendum. No final words.

They finished the sweep.

Not a single human being.

Not a trace of decay.

Not even a maintenance log past the nineteenth century.

Mallory stood in the control room again, staring at the untouched table, the cold meal, the waiting chairs.

“This ship’s been moving,” he said quietly. “Thinking. Choosing. For a hundred years.”

No one contradicted him.

Outside, sunlight glinted off a hull that had no right to exist—perfect, patient, and profoundly alone.

The first shudder ran through the deck like a held breath breaking.

Not a sharp jolt—something deeper. Structural. Wrong.

Mallory felt it through his boots before the sound reached him, a low, grinding tremor that made the air itself seem to thicken.

“—that’s not us,” someone said.

Then the Nautilus groaned.

Metal screamed—not tearing, not snapping, but *failing*. Bulkheads flexed visibly, ribs deforming in slow, impossible waves.

“Everyone out!” Mallory shouted, no hesitation now. “Move! Move!”

The lights flickered once.

Twice.

The floor lurched hard enough to throw a sailor into the table, plates skittering, crystal shattering at last. The illusion of calm died instantly.

“Captain, hull integrity is collapsing!” Mallory barked into his radio. “This ship is—Jesus Christ—it’s coming apart from the inside!”

Another violent shake. A seam in the wall split with a sound like ice breaking on a frozen lake.

“No heroics!” someone yelled. “Drop everything!”

They ran.

Boots hammered metal corridors that had been pristine seconds ago. The Nautilus was *undoing itself*—panels separating into clean segments, machinery disassembling with surgical precision rather than chaos.

It wasn’t an explosion.

It was a release.

They spilled back through the hatch in a rush, hands grabbing lines, bodies half-sliding, half-falling onto the deck of the **USS *Halibut***. Sailors were shouting headcounts, dragging the last man clear as the Nautilus convulsed one final time.

“Clear!” someone screamed. “We’re clear!”

The moment the last boot left its deck—

The Nautilus came apart.

Not tearing. Not collapsing.

*Disintegrating.*

The hull separated into thousands—tens of thousands—of fragments, each no larger than a fist, then smaller, then glittering particulate, as if the ship had decided it no longer wished to be a ship at all.

No shockwave.

No debris field.

Just a silent, cascading fall into the blue, the ocean closing over it as though it had never been disturbed.

The surface smoothed.

Gone.

No bubbles. No oil. No wreckage.

The sea returned to indifference.

No one spoke.

Captain **Keegan** stood at the rail, hands gripping it hard enough for his knuckles to whiten. He stared at the empty water, breathing slow, controlled—pure habit.

“Maybe,” he said finally, voice quiet, stripped of rank, “it didn’t want to be captured.”

No one answered.

He turned slightly, eyes scanning his deck—and stopped.

An engineer stood frozen a few feet away, clutching a bundle of books against his chest. Old. Bound. Handwritten.

Keegan knew instantly where they’d come from.

“Lieutenant,” he said calmly, though his pulse had not yet forgiven him, “those. Now.”

The engineer hesitated only a fraction of a second before handing them over.

Keegan took the logs carefully, like something alive, then looked back once more at the empty ocean.

“…but did it wait,” he murmured, more to himself than anyone else, “until everyone was out?”

He turned away.

“Clear my quarters,” Keegan said. “No copies. No inventory. These stay with me.”

He carried the books below, alone, while above him the Pacific closed over a secret that had decided—at the very last—to leave something behind.

---

The Oval Office felt smaller than it looked on television.

The curtains were half-drawn against a gray Washington afternoon, muting the light into something flat and bureaucratic. The air smelled faintly of paper and old polish. No photographers. No aides hovering with legal pads. Just four men who understood, without needing to say it, that this meeting would never appear in any archive.

President **Gerald Ford** sat behind the Resolute Desk, hands folded, expression neutral in the practiced way of a man whose job was to absorb damage without reflecting it. He hadn’t removed his jacket. He hadn’t loosened his tie.

**James Schlesinger** stood near the fireplace, arms crossed, weight slightly forward, as if daring the room to waste his time.

**Captain Daniel Keegan** sat stiff-backed on the couch, uniform immaculate, face drawn with the exhaustion of someone who had outlived an experience rather than survived it.

**Nelson Rockefeller** occupied the armchair closest to the window, chin resting lightly on his knuckles, eyes sharp with a financier’s curiosity rather than a politician’s caution.

Two additional chairs had been placed near the coffee table.

The translators sat there now.

One was a thin, middle-aged man from the NSA, wire-rim glasses, dark suit. He had the quiet confidence of someone who worked with dead languages daily. French and Latin were comfortable ground.

The other—older than expected—was a woman with graying hair pulled tight, posture rigid, hands folded neatly in her lap. Sanskrit was not a language one stumbled into accidentally. She had been vetted thoroughly. Everyone in the room knew it.

The books lay on the table between them.

Bound volumes. Thick paper. Ink that had not faded.

Ford nodded once. “You may begin.”

The NSA linguist opened the first log carefully, reverently, like a priest handling a relic.

“It’s… mixed,” he said after a moment. “Primarily French. Naval vernacular. Some classical Latin quotations. Biblical references. Poetry.”

“Anything technical?” Schlesinger asked sharply.

The man didn’t look up. “No, sir.”

He read aloud quietly, translating as he went.

“Daily routines. Watch rotations. Notes on currents. Weather. Philosophy.” He paused, turned a page. “Reflections on empire. Disdain for nationalism. Personal grief.”

Rockefeller’s eyebrow lifted. “Grief?”

“Yes,” the man said. “Repeated references to loss. Family. Homeland. Slavery. Injustice. He—whoever authored this—was deeply angry. But controlled.”

Keegan shifted slightly. “Any mention of the ship’s construction?”

The man shook his head. “None. Not a single schematic. No maintenance logs. Nothing resembling engineering notes.”

Schlesinger’s jaw tightened.

The Sanskrit translator spoke next, voice calm, precise.

“There are marginal notes,” she said. “Later additions. Philosophical. Almost… meditative. Not technical.”

Ford leaned forward slightly. “Dates?”

She glanced at the final pages. “The last entry across all volumes… is consistent.”

She looked up.

“1874.”

Silence settled into the room like dust.

“Nothing after,” she continued. “No farewell. No explanation. It simply… stops.”

Rockefeller exhaled softly. “So whatever sustained it afterward… wasn’t human.”

Keegan didn’t respond. He already knew.

Schlesinger broke the quiet. “Any indication of crew survival beyond that date?”

The NSA linguist flipped through several pages again, slower this time, as if hoping repetition would conjure something new.

“No, sir. The tone changes near the end. Less about voyages. More about… acceptance.”

“Acceptance of what?” Ford asked.

The man hesitated. “Purpose. Completion. Withdrawal.”

Schlesinger let out a humorless breath. “Of course.”

Keegan finally spoke. His voice was low, controlled. “There’s nothing about upkeep. No mention of repairs. No replacement parts.”

“None,” the man confirmed. “Which makes no sense.”

“No,” Keegan said. “It makes a different kind of sense.”

Ford straightened slightly. “You’re certain there’s no technical insight to be extracted?”

The Sanskrit translator shook her head. “If the knowledge existed, it was never written. Or never meant to survive.”

Schlesinger stared at the books as if they had personally insulted him.

“Then the most important machine ever built leaves us with philosophy,” he said flatly.

Rockefeller gave a thin smile. “That may have been intentional.”

Ford looked at the translators.

“You understand,” he said evenly, “that this material does not exist.”

Both nodded immediately.

“You will not discuss it,” Ford continued. “Not with colleagues. Not in memoirs. Not in hypotheticals. Not in old age.”

“Yes, Mr. President,” the NSA linguist said.

The woman inclined her head once. “Understood.”

Ford stood. The meeting was over.

“You’re dismissed,” he said. “Thank you for your service.”

The translators gathered their notes—carefully, deliberately—and were escorted out without another word.

The door closed softly behind them.

The books remained on the table.

And for a moment, no one spoke.

The room stayed quiet after the door shut.

Not awkward quiet. Heavy quiet.

Ford was the first to move. He returned to his chair behind the desk and sat more heavily than before, as if the weight of the last two hours had finally found somewhere to land.

“Well,” he said at last, voice even, unadorned. “That answers nothing.”

Rockefeller exhaled through his nose, still staring at the books. “We were never going to get schematics,” he said. “People like that don’t write instruction manuals.”

Schlesinger turned from the fireplace, irritation etched plainly across his face. “Mid-nineteenth century,” he said. “No electricity. No modern metallurgy. And it operates autonomously for a century without crew, maintenance, or degradation.”

He shook his head once, sharply. “It shouldn’t exist.”

Keegan sat forward slightly. “But it did.”

Schlesinger shot him a glance. “Past tense, Captain.”

Keegan didn’t rise to it. “With respect, sir, we still don’t know that.”

Ford’s eyes lifted. “You’re suggesting it had… what. A mind?”

Keegan chose his words carefully. “I’m suggesting it behaved with intent. Restraint. Memory. Adaptation.”

Rockefeller nodded slowly. “And timing. It waited.”

Schlesinger grimaced. “Intent does not require consciousness. Complex systems can—”

“—and yet,” Rockefeller interrupted mildly, “it cooked a meal a few hours before we arrived.”

That landed.

Schlesinger went quiet, jaw tightening.

Ford looked at the books again. “Whatever it was,” he said, “we will never know how it was built. Or how it endured.”

“No,” Keegan agreed. “And that may have been the point.”

Ford leaned back, fingers steepled. “Then we need a story.”

Schlesinger didn’t hesitate. “Soviet submarine. Unremarkable encounter. No engagement. No recovery. All previous incidents attributed to accidents, enemy action, or unknown losses.”

Rockefeller added, “And every vessel involved over the last hundred years? Lost. Wartime. Peacetime. Happens all the time.”

Ford nodded once. “That will hold.”

“The logs?” Keegan asked.

Schlesinger turned to him. “Sealed. Naval Intelligence. Deep storage. Top Secret. Eyes-only clearance, and I mean *eyes-only*.”

“No copies,” Rockefeller said. “No summaries.”

Ford looked directly at Keegan. “You’re comfortable with that, Captain?”

Keegan hesitated only a fraction of a second. “Yes, Mr. President.”

Then he cleared his throat.

“There is one concern,” he said. “The *Halibut*’s crew. One hundred thirty-four men. They saw it. Entered it. And the Soviet boat—K-387—was there.”

Schlesinger’s expression didn’t change. “They’ll be sworn to silence.”

Keegan frowned slightly. “That many people—”

“—isn’t many,” Schlesinger cut in. “Not when the alternative is ridicule. Who would believe them?”

Rockefeller smiled thinly. “A ghost submarine from the 1800s that disassembled itself? They’d be laughed out of the room.”

Ford’s voice was calm. “And sailors know how to keep secrets when the Navy tells them to.”

Keegan nodded slowly. “Yes, sir.”

Silence returned, different now. Settled. Decisions made.

Ford stood, signaling the end without ceremony. “Then that’s how it ends.”

He glanced once more at the books.

“An accident,” he said. “A misunderstanding. And a hundred years of bad luck.”

No one argued.

Outside the Oval Office, Washington went on as it always did—traffic, meetings, headlines.

Ever feel like your savings are just sitting there, doing… not much? Like a gym membership you pay for but never use? What if I told you that money could be working *way* harder for you—maybe even funding your dream retirement sooner than you think?

Here’s the thing: **Most people underestimate their financial potential.** They stash cash in a savings account earning 0.01% interest (yawn) or let it languish in a low-growth investment, while inflation quietly eats away at it. Meanwhile, their future self is out there, tapping their foot, waiting for a better plan.

### **3 Signs Your Money Is Secretly a Superhero (But You’re Not Letting It Fly)**
1. **You’ve Got “Lazy Money”**
   - That emergency fund? Great. But if it’s been sitting in the same account since 2012, it’s basically taking a nap while inflation parties.
   - *Example:* $10K in a savings account at 0.5% interest = **$50 a year**. That same $10K in a high-yield account or smart investment? Could be **$500+**. Which one sounds like a better side hustle?

2. **You’re Playing It Too Safe (And Losing)**
   - “But what if the market crashes?” Fair. But what if it *doesn’t*? Historically, even with dips, the market trends upward. Meanwhile, cash under your mattress? **100% guaranteed to lose value.**
   - *Fun fact:* If you’d invested $1K in the S&P 500 in 2010, it’d be worth ~$5K today. If you’d left it in a savings account? ~$1.1K. Ouch.

3. **You’re Not Using the Right Tools**
   - Ever tried assembling IKEA furniture with a butter knife? That’s what managing money without the right tools feels like.
   - **Pro tip:** Platforms like [Mavely](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb) help you see how small tweaks to your savings strategy could add up to *big* retirement wins. (Full transparency: That’s my affiliate link—because I only share stuff I’d actually use.)

### **The Easy Fix: Put Your Money to Work (Without the Stress)**
- **Step 1:** Audit your accounts. Where’s your money *actually* growing? (Spoiler: If the answer is “nowhere,” we’ve got work to do.)
- **Step 2:** Move “lazy money” to high-yield savings or low-risk investments. Even a 3-5% return beats *nothing*.
- **Step 3:** Automate it. Set up transfers so you’re paying *future you* first. (Your 65-year-old self will send you a fruit basket.)

### **Here’s the Kickers**
- You don’t need to be a Wall Street whiz to grow wealth. You just need to **stop ignoring the potential** of what you already have.
- The best time to start? **10 years ago.** The second-best time? *Right now.*

So, what’s one small move you could make this week to wake up your money? Maybe it’s opening that high-yield account. Maybe it’s finally running the numbers to see how much your savings *could* grow. (Hint: [This tool](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb) makes it stupid simple.)

Your future self is cheering you on. Don’t leave them hanging.

*(ONI archival extract — read by Commander Daniel Keeman)*

The *Hornett* ran silent.

Not battle silent—administrative silent. No unnecessary announcements, no raised voices, no gallows humor. The crew had felt the pressure pass beneath them hours earlier, and the ship carried that memory the way men carried near misses: quietly, without argument.

Keeman sat at his desk with the second log open, a cup of coffee cooling untouched beside it. The paper looked newer than the French file, but not by much. Typed. Navy formatting. Margins tight. Language careful in the way only American military prose could be when it wanted to deny something without lying outright.

The header read:

**1898 — AMERICA’S FIRST BRUSH**

Keeman frowned faintly and began.

---

**Ship:** USS *Resolute*
Auxiliary Cruiser
Converted merchant hull
Coal-fired steam propulsion

Keeman noted the conversion immediately. Civilian bones wrapped in military intention. Vulnerable. Loud. Blind by modern standards.

---

**Era:** Spanish–American War
**Location:** Caribbean Sea
Approximately 40 nautical miles south of Cuba

The Caribbean at night. Warm water. Clear thermals. A perfect place for shadows to be seen and dismissed.

---

**Incident Summary:**

While maneuvering at night under darkened-ship conditions, USS *Resolute* experienced a sudden structural failure below the waterline.

No torpedo wake observed.
No explosion reported.
Severe inward hull deformation recorded.
Ship remained afloat but rendered non-operational.

Mission aborted.

Keeman paused.

Mission-killed.

That phrase carried weight. Whoever caused this hadn’t been interested in sinking the ship—just in stopping it from mattering.

---

**Pre-Contact Conditions:**

Spanish naval forces possessed no submarine capability.

No mines recorded in operational area.

Weather calm. Visibility moderate.

Keeman nodded grimly.

No enemy explanation available. That was dangerous for reports.

---

**Eyewitness Accounts:**

Multiple lookouts reported a large shadow passing beneath the hull moments before impact.

Descriptions varied, but consistently noted:

• elongated shape
• smooth outline
• absence of wake or surface disturbance

One lookout stated:

> “It moved like a thought. Then the ship screamed.”

Keeman felt a chill he did not acknowledge.

---

**Damage Assessment:**

Hull plates bent inward along a narrow longitudinal band.

Rivets sheared cleanly.

Internal framing distorted upward.

No fragmentation patterns consistent with explosives.

Impact force localized and controlled.

Keeman stopped reading and leaned back.

Identical.

Not similar. Not approximate.

Identical to *Saint-Michel*. Identical to the damage on the *Hornett*’s sister ship sitting half-dismantled in Subic Bay.

---

**Aftermath:**

Official cause attributed to collision with submerged wreckage.

Captain James Holloway privately disputed findings.

Quote from personal correspondence (never entered into official log):

> “Wreckage does not move against the tide, nor does it choose its angle.”

Report downgraded in priority.

No further investigation authorized.

Captain reassigned within the year.

Keeman exhaled slowly.

Reassigned. Not punished. Just… moved aside.

The Navy’s oldest solution.

---

**Analyst Commentary (Added 1932):**

This incident marks the United States Navy’s first recorded encounter with the phenomenon.

Notable observations:

• Occurs during minor conflict
• No attempt to exploit wartime vulnerability
• No follow-up action

Indicates disinterest in limited wars.

Reinforces pattern of selective engagement.

Keeman stared at the phrase *selective engagement*.

Whoever—or whatever—this was, it had chosen not to involve itself in a war that would reshape American power. It hadn’t helped Spain. It hadn’t helped the United States.

It simply… passed through.

A soft knock came at the door.

“Captain?” Harris again. “Soviet contact’s still holding range.”

Keeman closed the log carefully.

“Are they maneuvering?” he asked.

“No, sir. Same bearing. Same distance.”

Keeman nodded. “They’re doing exactly what we’re doing.”

Harris hesitated. “Sir… permission to speak freely?”

“Granted.”

“It feels like,” Harris said, choosing his words, “we’re both waiting for something to decide we matter.”

Keeman looked down at the closed log.

“That’s because we are,” he said.

After Harris left, Keeman reopened the final page of the report and traced the damage diagram with his finger.

A straight line.

Measured.

Deliberate.

The United States Navy had not been attacked in 1898.

It had been *judged*.

And found unworthy of notice.

Keeman sat back in his chair and stared at the bulkhead, the *Hornett*’s hull between him and the Pacific.

For the first time since taking command, he felt truly, profoundly out of his depth—not tactically, not professionally—

Historically.

---

### Shadowing (CHASE)

The Pacific did not resist the *Hornett*’s caution.

When Keeman ordered a reduction in speed, the engines responded with a subdued compliance, the vibration through the hull easing almost imperceptibly. The boat settled into a slower rhythm, the kind meant for listening rather than moving.

“New speed steady,” Engineering reported.

Keeman didn’t answer immediately. His eyes were on the sonar repeater mounted near the control console.

The acoustic void slowed too.

Not lagged. Not overshot.

Matched.

“Sonar,” Keeman said calmly.

Harris leaned closer to his station. “Sir?”

“Confirm correlation.”

Lang’s fingers danced lightly across the controls. “Confirmed. Speed match within margin of error.”

Keeman nodded once.

“Change depth,” he said. “Down twenty feet. Gradual.”

The ballast tanks adjusted with a muted sigh. The *Hornett* eased downward through the thermal layers, passing into cooler, denser water.

A beat.

Then Lang spoke again, quieter now. “Contact adjusted depth. Same delta.”

A few heads turned. No one spoke.

“Hold depth,” Keeman said.

They did.

So did the void.

Minutes passed. Then more. The kind of time that felt thick, stretched, measured not in seconds but in attention.

“Captain,” Harris said finally, “I’d like to put words to this, and I don’t like them.”

“Go ahead.”

“It’s not maneuvering,” Harris said. “It’s… waiting.”

Keeman folded his arms. “Waiting for what?”

Harris shook his head slightly. “I don’t know, sir. For us to finish doing whatever we think we’re doing.”

A new contact flickered at the edge of the display.

“Soviet submarine adjusting course,” Lang reported. “They’re closing slightly, but staying outside our envelope.”

Keeman watched the bearing line shift.

“They’re nervous,” he said.

“They should be,” Harris replied. “They don’t know if this thing’s escorting us or ignoring us.”

Keeman looked at the sonar plot again.

Escort implied intent.

Ignore implied hierarchy.

Neither comforted him.

The Soviet boat altered depth, then corrected. Their maneuvering was subtle but unmistakably human—calculations layered on top of uncertainty.

The void did not react.

It held station.

“Captain,” Harris said carefully, “if this were a standard contact, we’d classify this as shadowing behavior.”

Keeman’s gaze remained fixed forward. “From which side?”

Harris didn’t answer immediately.

“Sir,” he said at last, “from *ours*.”

The room went very still.

Keeman considered that. Not emotionally. Structurally. As a man trained to think in vectors and doctrines and adversarial logic.

And finding none of it applied.

“Helm,” he said, “come to course zero-nine-zero. Maintain speed.”

The *Hornett* turned.

The void turned.

Perfectly.

No correction curve. No lag.

Just alignment.

Keeman felt something settle in his chest—not fear, but clarity.

“We’re not being tracked,” he said. “We’re being… accompanied.”

Harris nodded slowly. “Like it’s letting us stay.”

Keeman turned toward the sonar room.

“Log this phase as SHADOWING,” he said. “And strike any language that implies pursuit.”

Harris blinked. “Sir?”

“We’re not chasing it,” Keeman said. “We’re following.”

He paused, then added, “And only because it allows it.”

The Soviet contact altered course again, increasing distance. Their confidence had limits.

“Captain,” Lang said, voice barely above a whisper, “I’m getting the impression that if we turned away, it would simply… leave.”

Keeman considered the thought.

“Yes,” he said. “And if we charged it—”

“We’d be irrelevant,” Harris finished.

Keeman nodded.

“Helm,” he said quietly, “maintain position relative to contact. No attempts to close. No attempts to provoke.”

“Aye, sir.”

The *Hornett* slipped into the wake of something that did not disturb the water.

Keeman stood at the center of the control room, hands clasped behind his back, posture relaxed in a way none of his crew had ever seen before.

The hunter’s stance was gone.

In its place stood a witness—one aware that history was unfolding not through conquest or combat, but through proximity.

And somewhere beyond steel and sonar, something ancient continued on its way, unhurried, unthreatened—

Allowing itself to be observed.

----

### Log Three — World War I: The First Modern Panic (1915)

*(ONI archival extract — read by Commander Daniel Keeman)*

The *Hornett* held her depth, engines barely whispering, the Pacific sliding past as though reluctant to acknowledge either ship or watcher.

Keeman sat at his desk with the third log open. He had waited longer than necessary before reading it. The date alone carried weight.

**1915.**

The first war where the sea itself had become a battlefield of machines.

This file was thicker. More annotations. More crossed-out conclusions. Fear left fingerprints.

---

**Ship:** HMS *Ravenhurst*
Destroyer escort
Royal Navy

Keeman immediately noted the class.

Fast. Agile. Purpose-built for submarine warfare.

Modern—for its time.

---

**Era:** World War I
Battle of the Atlantic

**Location:** North Atlantic
Approximately 120 nautical miles west of Ireland

Cold water. Heavy seas. Dense traffic. A place where mistakes multiplied quickly.

---

**Incident Summary:**

During night convoy escort operations, HMS *Ravenhurst* detected a submerged contact ahead of formation.

Contact classified as hostile.

Moments later, *Ravenhurst* sustained catastrophic damage below the waterline and sank rapidly.

Total time from impact to loss: approximately four minutes.

Keeman closed his eyes briefly.

Four minutes was not a torpedo kill. It was too fast—and too clean.

---

**Pre-Impact Conditions:**

No torpedo wake observed.
No explosion reported.
No audible detonation.

Sonar primitive. Hydrophones inconclusive.

Contact registered briefly, then vanished.

Keeman frowned.

Registered.

Then vanished.

---

**Survivor Testimony:**

Survivors consistently described a “massive pressure wave” rather than an impact.

Quote from Able Seaman Thomas Griggs:

> “It felt like the sea itself struck us. Like being crushed in a giant hand.”

Another survivor stated:

> “There was no bang. Just… folding.”

Several reported seeing a dark mass pass beneath the ship immediately before loss.

Object departed immediately after impact.

No pursuit of convoy.

Keeman’s fingers tightened on the edge of the page.

It didn’t finish the job.

It didn’t chase the rest.

---

**Damage Analysis (Post-War Review):**

Hull deformation indicated inward compression along keel and adjacent frames.

No fragmentation consistent with explosives.

Structural failure propagated upward.

Matches no known German weapon system.

Keeman read that line twice.

Matches no known German weapon system.

---

**Aftermath:**

Official cause attributed to advanced German mine.

Classification upheld despite internal objections.

Several officers privately disputed findings.

Survivors’ testimony quietly discouraged to maintain morale.

Keeman felt a familiar, sour recognition.

This wasn’t cover-up.

This was *containment*.

---

**Internal Admiralty Memorandum (1917 — Restricted):**

Quote:

> “If such a weapon exists, acknowledging it serves no strategic purpose and undermines confidence in escort doctrine.”

Keeman snorted quietly.

Doctrine over truth.

---

**Analyst Commentary (Added 1946):**

This incident represents the first large-scale naval panic associated with the phenomenon.

Key observations:

• Wartime conditions do not alter behavior
• No exploitation of convoy vulnerability
• Immediate disengagement after single strike

Indicates purpose is not attrition.

Action appears demonstrative.

Keeman stared at the word.

Demonstrative.

Again.

---

**Institutional Impact:**

Royal Navy quietly revised escort spacing standards.

Several sonar false positives reclassified as “environmental anomalies.”

Informal avoidance behaviors observed among experienced captains.

Fear enters doctrine.

Keeman closed the file slowly.

That was the difference.

In 1874, it was dismissed.

In 1898, it was doubted.

By 1915, it was *feared*.

A soft voice broke the silence.

“Captain?”

Harris stood at the doorway, not intruding, not retreating.

Keeman looked up. “Yes.”

“Soviet boat just altered course again,” Harris said. “They’re increasing distance.”

Keeman nodded. “They’ve read their own logs.”

Harris hesitated. “Sir… does war make it more dangerous?”

Keeman glanced down at the closed file, then back up.

“No,” he said. “War doesn’t matter to it.”

Harris frowned. “Then why sink the *Ravenhurst*?”

Keeman answered without hesitation.

“Because it was in the way.”

Harris absorbed that, then quietly withdrew.

Keeman leaned back in his chair and stared at the bulkhead.

World War I had not provoked aggression.

It had not invited alliance.

It had simply revealed scale.

This thing did not hunt fleets.

It did not care who was winning.

It applied pressure, once, precisely—and then left.

As if reminding humanity that even in total war, there were still forces that did not belong to it.

Keeman reached for his coffee, found it cold, and drank it anyway.

Outside the hull, something ancient continued on its path, indifferent to flags, convoys, and panic—

Leaving behind a trail of crushed steel and institutional silence that stretched across decades.

---

### Chapter 7 — The Basin (CHASE)

The ocean changed first.

Not visually—there was nothing to see—but acoustically, unmistakably. The background noise thinned, stretched, then warped. Thermal layers stacked oddly, no longer clean horizontal bands but sloping, folded shapes, like the sea itself had been bent and never fully relaxed.

“Captain,” Harris said quietly, “the water down here is… wrong.”

Keeman stood behind him, hands folded behind his back, eyes fixed on the displays. “Define wrong.”

Harris hesitated. “It’s behaving like we’re inside a structure. Reflections aren’t decaying normally.”

Lang chimed in from the adjacent console. “We’re getting multi-path returns that don’t correspond to seabed contours. Too regular.”

Keeman nodded once. “Where’s the contact?”

Lang swallowed. “Still ahead. Same relative position. But it’s descending.”

Keeman looked to the chart table. “Helm, follow. Match depth changes. Slowly.”

“Aye, sir.”

The *Hornett* eased downward, ballast adjusting with a restrained sigh. Depth ticked lower than any peacetime patrol Keeman had commanded. The pressure hull creaked faintly, not in protest, but acknowledgment.

“Captain,” Engineering said over the intercom, “we’re approaching design comfort limits.”

“I know,” Keeman replied evenly. “Hold as long as you can.”

The ridge appeared next.

Not visually—never visually—but in the data. Sonar returns painted a jagged wall rising from the abyss, then falling away into something deeper still.

“A basin,” Harris murmured. “Surrounded by ridges. Natural formation, but… exaggerated.”

“How deep?” Keeman asked.

Lang checked his instruments twice. “Bottom’s off-scale, sir. We’re reading depth beyond charted maxima.”

The contact slowed.

So did they.

“It’s waiting again,” Harris said.

“No,” Keeman replied. “It’s arriving.”

The acoustic void slipped forward, then downward, angling toward the basin’s center. The *Hornett* followed at a respectful distance, no longer pretending this was a tactical maneuver.

The distortion intensified.

Sound did not simply reflect—it *returned*, layered and delayed, as though the basin were holding onto it briefly before letting it go.

“Captain,” Lang said, voice tight, “I’m getting something new.”

“Go on.”

“Hard return. Massive. Regular geometry.”

Keeman stepped closer. “Natural?”

Lang shook his head. “No, sir. Too smooth. Too symmetrical.”

Harris leaned over the console, eyes narrowing. “That’s not a wreck.”

The display resolved further.

Lines emerged—vast, curved surfaces, intersecting at angles no geological process favored. The scale was wrong. Too large. Too intentional.

“Artificial,” Harris whispered.

Keeman felt the word settle heavily in his chest.

“How big?” he asked.

Lang didn’t answer immediately. He adjusted the scale again. Then again.

“Sir,” he said finally, “it’s… enormous.”

The contact approached the structure without slowing.

No hesitation.

No docking maneuver.

It simply… ceased to be separate.

The acoustic void folded inward, merged with the greater mass, and vanished entirely.

The basin went quiet in a way Keeman had never experienced. Not silence—absence. As if the sea had reached a point where it no longer bothered to echo.

“Captain,” Harris said softly, “the contact is gone.”

Keeman nodded. “No. It’s home.”

A new sound cut through the room.

“Soviet contact changing behavior,” Lang reported. “They’ve stopped maneuvering. Holding at range.”

Keeman glanced at the bearing. “They see it.”

“Yes, sir. And… Captain—”

“Yes?”

“They’re pinging. Very low power. Cautious.”

Keeman allowed himself a thin smile. “They just realized this isn’t something that passes through.”

The Soviet submarine edged closer, then stopped again. Its movements were hesitant now, stripped of pretense.

“They thought it was a ship,” Harris said. “A platform.”

Keeman shook his head slowly. “It’s an address.”

The *Hornett* held position at the basin’s edge, a small, fragile thing hovering near something that predated sonar doctrine, predated the Cold War, perhaps predated the very idea that the ocean was empty until humans filled it with noise.

“Log this,” Keeman said quietly. “Structure classified under CHASE. No engagement assumptions. No operational speculation.”

Harris nodded. “Sir… what is it?”

Keeman looked at the vast, unreadable geometry on the display.

“A residence,” he said. “And we are guests.”

Outside the hull, far below any flag or doctrine, the Nautilus rested—not roaming, not hunting—

Waiting.

And for the first time, modern navies understood that it had never been alone at sea.

It had simply been *at home*.

---

### Log Four — The Modern Confirmation (1943)

*(ONI archival extract — read by Commander Daniel Keeman)*

The basin lay behind them now.

Not left—*permitted to recede*. The *Hornett* held station at the edge of the ridge system, engines idling, the artificial geometry still faintly present in the sonar background like a memory that refused to decay.

Keeman sat at his desk, the fourth log open.

This one was stamped **WORLD WAR II** in heavy type, the kind meant to convey certainty. It failed.

---

**LOG 4 — 1943**
**Designation:** *The Modern Confirmation*

Keeman read on.

---

**Ship:** USS *Wexford*
Fletcher-class destroyer

Keeman’s jaw tightened.

Fast. Heavily armed. Bristling with sonar, depth charges, doctrine. Everything the Navy believed would make the sea understandable.

---

**Era:** World War II
Battle of the Atlantic

**Location:** South Atlantic
Approximately 80 nautical miles east of Ascension Island

That alone raised an eyebrow.

German U-boats did not belong there. Not in 1943. Not that far south. The ocean there was too empty, too vast to justify the risk.

And yet.

---

**Incident Summary:**

USS *Wexford* detected an anomalous sonar contact pacing the ship.

Contact classified as hostile submarine.

Despite unusual location, command elected to engage.

Keeman paused.

Elected.

The arrogance of it sat heavy on the page.

---

**Pre-Engagement Observations:**

Contact matched ship’s speed and heading.

No screw noise detected.
No cavitation.
No identifiable propulsion signature.

Contact maintained constant relative position for approximately six minutes.

Keeman leaned back slightly.

Six minutes was an eternity in anti-submarine warfare.

---

**Engagement Attempt:**

*Wexford* maneuvered to close and prosecute contact.

Before weapons could be deployed, contact closed deliberately and struck the destroyer below the waterline.

No detonation.
No explosion.

Severe inward hull deformation sustained.

Ship crippled but remained afloat.

Keeman exhaled slowly.

Not ambush.

Not evasion.

Approach.

---

**Post-Impact Behavior:**

Contact disengaged immediately after impact.

No pursuit.
No secondary strike.

Contact vanished from sonar.

Keeman underlined the word *deliberately* in his mind.

---

**Damage Assessment:**

Hull plates bent inward along keel-adjacent frames.

Rivets sheared cleanly.

Machinery spaces flooded.

Damage inconsistent with collision between two comparable vessels.

Keeman didn’t bother rereading that.

He already knew.

---

**Official Explanation:**

Collision with German U-boat during submerged maneuvering.

Explanation accepted due to wartime operational tempo.

Incident absorbed into broader loss statistics.

Keeman’s lips pressed thin.

Wartime volume.

The most effective burial ground in history.

---

**Captain’s Private Note (Recovered Postwar):**

Captain Harold Bell, personal correspondence, never filed:

> “I have rammed submarines before. They do not feel like that.
> Whatever struck us did so with intent and restraint.”

Keeman sat very still.

Intent *and* restraint.

Bell had understood.

---

**Analyst Commentary (Added 1961):**

This incident confirms failure of modern ASW doctrine to classify the phenomenon.

Notable points:

• Contact behavior identical to 19th-century and WWI encounters
• Modern sonar provides confirmation, not clarity
• Damage profile unchanged across decades

First explicit internal reference to “Nemo” appears in margin notes of this file.

Keeman’s eyes narrowed.

Margin notes.

---

**Margin Annotation (Anonymous, circa 1960):**

> “If Nemo was a man once, he is no longer the point.”

Keeman closed the file slowly, as if it might react badly to being rushed.

That line lingered.

Not the point.

A knock at the door.

“Captain,” Harris said quietly, “the Soviet boat has backed off another five thousand yards.”

Keeman looked up. “They’ve seen enough.”

Harris hesitated. “Sir… after reading everything we’ve seen… why didn’t it sink the *Wexford*?”

Keeman answered without looking down at the log.

“Because it didn’t need to,” he said. “Sinking is for enemies.”

Harris frowned. “Then what are we?”

Keeman thought of the basin. The structure. The way the contact had merged with it like a returning limb.

“We’re animals that learned to swim,” he said. “And occasionally bark.”

Harris absorbed that, then nodded and left.

Keeman remained seated, staring at the closed log.

By 1943, the Navy had sonar.

Doctrine.

Confidence.

And it still failed—because it assumed the sea was a battlefield, not a place someone else had already claimed.

This was not a weapon that outpaced technology.

It was a presence that ignored it.

Keeman finally understood what the logs had been building toward.

Nemo had never been the mystery.

He had simply been the *last human explanation* anyone could tolerate.

Outside the hull, deep within the basin behind them, something ancient rested in silence—having proven, once again, that even modern war changed nothing at all.

---

### The Invitation (CHASE)

The basin did not release them all at once.

The *Hornett* held position for nearly forty minutes after the structure faded from effective range, the artificial geometry dissolving back into acoustic ambiguity. No one spoke above a murmur. The crew worked as if sound itself might offend something listening.

Then the ocean changed again.

“Captain,” Lang said, voice tight but controlled, “I’m getting a vertical movement.”

Keeman stepped forward. “Bearing?”

“Dead ahead. Same bearing we lost the contact.”

Harris leaned in. “Rate?”

Lang hesitated. “Deliberate.”

Keeman nodded. “Depth change?”

“Ascending.”

A low murmur rippled through the control room. Ascending contacts were aggressive by doctrine. This one was anything but hurried.

“Maintain depth,” Keeman ordered. “No maneuvering.”

“Aye, sir.”

The acoustic void reappeared—but altered.

It was no longer simply absence. It *pulsed*.

Pressure modulation rippled through the water, not as noise but as rhythm. A gentle compression, release, compression again. Too regular to be natural. Too measured to be mechanical failure.

“Captain,” Harris said slowly, “that’s structured.”

Keeman’s eyes narrowed. “Repeatable?”

“Yes, sir. Patterned. It’s not sonar. It’s… displacement.”

The *Hornett* felt it then.

Not force. Not threat.

A subtle, even pressure against the hull, as though the sea itself were tapping politely, testing for attention.

“Engineering,” Keeman said calmly. “Report.”

“All systems nominal,” came the reply. “No stress alarms. Hull integrity holding.”

Keeman nodded. “Thank you.”

The contact rose into clearer water.

And then—light.

“Visual anomaly,” Lang whispered.

Keeman turned sharply. “Explain.”

“Captain… there’s illumination below us. Not bioluminescence. Too steady. Too… geometric.”

The periscope camera was useless at this depth, but the external low-light sensors fed grainy images to a small auxiliary screen.

A glow bloomed beneath the *Hornett*.

Soft. White-blue. Diffuse, yet clearly bounded. Lines curved through it, faint but unmistakably intentional.

Harris swallowed. “That’s not a reflection.”

“No,” Keeman said quietly. “That’s an invitation.”

The contact rose until it was just beneath them—not touching, not pressing. Holding.

The pressure modulation slowed, spaced wider now, like breathing.

“Captain,” Lang said, voice barely above a whisper, “it’s not threatening us.”

Keeman nodded. “Because it doesn’t need to.”

A new report cut in.

“Soviet contact has halted,” the radio officer said. “They’re holding position. No depth changes.”

Keeman glanced at the bearing. “They won’t come closer.”

“Why?” Harris asked.

Keeman watched the slow pulse of light beneath the hull.

“Because this isn’t theirs to approach,” he said. “And they know it.”

The Soviet submarine remained distant, a silent witness to something it had no doctrine for and no language to report.

The light intensified slightly, then stabilized.

The pressure modulation shifted again—two pulses, a pause, one pulse.

Harris frowned. “Captain… it’s repeating.”

Keeman considered.

“Response,” he said. “Not command.”

He turned to the helm.

“Bring us down five feet,” he ordered. “Slowly.”

The *Hornett* eased downward.

The light adjusted.

Perfectly.

No collision. No correction. Just accommodation.

A collective breath released in the control room.

“It’s choosing us,” Lang said.

Keeman shook his head gently.

“No,” he said. “It’s allowing us.”

He straightened.

“Log this phase as INVITATION,” he said. “All prior assumptions suspended.”

Harris looked at him. “Sir… what happens next?”

Keeman met his gaze, calm and certain in a way he had never felt at sea before.

“We accept,” he said. “Or we leave.”

The *Hornett* hovered above the glow, unthreatened, unchallenged.

For the first time in a century of encounters, the sea was not resisting observation.

It was offering it.

And somewhere below, something older than modern war waited patiently—not for conquest, not for fear—

But for consent.

---

### Log Five — The Sensor Era Encounter (1963)

*(ONI archival extract — read by Commander Daniel Keeman)*

The light beneath the *Hornett* remained steady.

Not brighter. Not dimmer. Simply *present*—a constant beneath the keel, as if reminding them that the invitation had not expired.

Keeman sat at his desk with the fifth log open. This one felt different the moment he touched it. Thinner. Cleaner. Less narrative.

Modern.

Which meant more afraid.

---

**LOG 5 — 1963**
**Designation:** *The Sensor Era Encounter*

Keeman read on.

---

**Ship:** USNS *Kepler*
Oceanographic Research Vessel
Civilian crew, Navy-sponsored mission

Keeman noted that immediately.

Not a warship.
Not armed.
Not pretending to hunt.

Listening, not prowling.

---

**Era:** Cold War
Peacetime

**Location:** Central Pacific Ocean
Coordinates redacted

Of course they were.

---

**Mission Profile:**

Seabed mapping and acoustic characterization.

High-resolution active and passive sonar arrays deployed.

Objective: geological survey.

Keeman exhaled slowly.

This wasn’t an accident.

This was someone knocking on the seabed with instruments instead of steel.

---

**Incident Summary:**

During routine mapping operations, sonar systems detected a massive acoustic void beneath the vessel.

Void exhibited consistent spatial coherence across multiple arrays.

Pressure gradient data suggested a large object displacing water without generating sound.

No collision occurred.

Keeman’s eyes narrowed.

Displacing water.

Without sound.

---

**Sensor Observations:**

No visual contact.

No acoustic return.

No Doppler shift.

Equipment functioned within nominal parameters.

Multiple independent systems confirmed readings.

Void moved slowly relative to vessel, then vanished.

Keeman paused.

Vanished.

Not fled. Not accelerated.

*Ceased to be detectable.*

---

**Crew Statements:**

Operators reported sensation of “something being present without being there.”

One technician stated:

> “It was like mapping a hole in the ocean.”

Another noted:

> “We kept waiting for the echo that never came.”

Keeman nodded.

By 1963, sailors no longer needed to see shadows. They trusted machines.

And the machines had seen nothing—and everything.

---

**Aftermath:**

ONI personnel boarded *Kepler* at next port of call.

All data confiscated.

Original tapes destroyed.

Crew subjected to individual debriefings.

Non-disclosure agreements enforced.

Incident not formally logged as contact.

Keeman’s lips pressed into a thin line.

Of course not.

Acknowledging contact required an object.

This had been absence.

---

**Internal ONI Assessment (Classified):**

This event indicates adaptation to modern sensor environments.

Notable conclusions:

• Entity avoids interaction with non-threatening platforms
• Demonstrates awareness of active/passive detection methods
• Capable of complete acoustic invisibility

Behavior suggests deliberate choice to remain unobserved.

Keeman leaned back.

Avoidance.

Not hostility.

Not engagement.

Choice.

---

**Analyst Commentary (Added 1971):**

This marks a shift in pattern.

From interaction → demonstration → avoidance.

Indicates entity recognizes escalation of human sensing capability.

Response is concealment, not confrontation.

Confirms intelligence and restraint.

Keeman closed his eyes.

By 1963, humanity had filled the ocean with sound.

Sonar nets. Mapping arrays. Listening posts that reached across entire basins.

And *it had adapted*.

It had stopped touching ships.

Stopped bending steel.

Stopped making itself felt at all.

Until now.

Keeman opened his eyes and looked toward the control room bulkhead.

A soft knock came.

“Captain?” Harris again. He had learned to knock softly.

Keeman didn’t look away from the closed log. “Yes.”

“The light’s still there,” Harris said. “Stable. No pressure change.”

Keeman nodded.

“Sir,” Harris continued, “if it learned to avoid us in ’63… why now?”

Keeman considered the question carefully.

“Because this time,” he said, “we didn’t try to map it.”

Harris frowned. “Then what did we do?”

Keeman stood, holding the log in both hands.

“We followed,” he said. “We waited. We stopped pretending the sea was empty until we measured it.”

He looked down at the final line of the analyst commentary, then closed the file and locked it away.

For a century, it had tolerated humanity.

Warned it.

Ignored it.

Avoided it.

Now, beneath the *Hornett*, wrapped in light and pressure and impossible silence, it had done something unprecedented.

It had made itself visible again.

Not because it had to.

But because, for the first time since humans learned to listen—

Started out with a used Intel E2160 and 4670 512MB build. The E2160 was a dual core 1.8GHz CPU that I could overclock to about 3.2GHz. My Crysis framerate would roughly double due to the OC. I believe it was a $50 CPU at the time so you could really juice it without worrying too much.  
  
Currently using a 7800X3D + 4070 Ti Super. 

Almost every time I would tell myself *""this is my long term system for years to come""* but without fail I would end up upgrading either CPU or GPU within a year or so even though most of the games I played really didn't need it.

Did dabble in crypto mining for a bit and expecting some hate comments for it - it was pretty profitable at the time. Overall I love the hobby - definitely spent way more money then I needed to though doing constant side-grades. Really it was all for the love of the build. 

I think my \~18 months with my current build is the longest I've had the same core components and given current pricing I cannot see that changing anytime soon. Would love a 5080 or 5090 but not willing to pay (and I really don't need one).

The Seneca Baduk salon sat in the middle of nowhere and somehow at the center of the world.

The building used to be a laundromat. You could still see where the industrial dryers had been ripped out and replaced with low tables, where the detergent vents had been boarded over, where cigarette smoke now leaked instead. The walls were covered in newspaper clippings—Japanese tournaments, Korean champions, one crooked photo of Mee-Ma shaking hands with a man whose name had been blacked out by marker after a cheating scandal. Somewhere in the back, a fan rattled like it had asthma.

Every chair was empty.

The trailer park was on tour. Savannah this week. Charleston after. Ninety percent of Seneca’s rednecks—some of the strongest Baduk players on the continent—were drinking hotel coffee and crushing amateurs for prize money and beer tabs. They wouldn’t be back until tomorrow.

Which was why Lily was here now.

She always came when it was empty.

She sat on a raised cushion across from an old man whose hands wouldn’t stop shaking. His board rank tag said 3-kyu. It lied for politeness. He’d played the opening aggressively and died for it. He’d tried to salvage the midgame with influence and lost the timing. Now they were deep in yose, the board quiet enough that every placement sounded loud.

Click.

Lily’s final stone landed on the second line with surgical indifference.

No flourish. No hesitation.

Just correct.

The old man stared at the board like he was watching a crime scene reconstruction of his own mistakes.

He rubbed his face with both hands. “So that’s it, then.”

Lily didn’t move.

He leaned closer, counting twice though he already knew. “Twelve points,” he muttered. “You beat me by twelve. I thought I had you when I got that wall on the right.”

Lily tilted the board slightly, rotating it so the corner invasion was fully visible. The dead shape he’d defended was still there, ugly and inevitable.

The old man followed her gesture, groaned, then laughed quietly at himself. “You never even attacked it. You just… waited until it was already dead.”

Lily’s face stayed blank.

But he nodded anyway, as if she’d just delivered a long explanation.

“That’s what you redneck monsters do,” he said. “You don’t fight. You let people exhaust themselves trying to be heroes.”

Lily reached forward and reset the captured stones into their bowls with neat, efficient movements. Black first. Then white.

The sound was soft. Final.

The old man pushed his chair back with a tired smile. “Thank you for the lesson, kid.”

Lily did not acknowledge the thanks.

He hesitated, then added cautiously, “You’re… what, thirteen now?”

Lily didn’t react.

“Yeah,” he said to himself. “September birthday. I forgot.” He shook his head, half impressed, half bitter. “Dan-4 at thirteen. Damn shame about the exam.”

Lily’s eyes flicked, just once, toward the calendar on the wall. October 1994. The pro exams were already over. July through August. The window had closed without mercy.

The old man followed her gaze. “Next year, then,” he said gently. “You’ll be legal next year.”

Lily gathered the board.

Not eagerly. Not angrily.

Just precisely.

The salon remained empty. The fan rattled. Outside, cicadas screamed into late afternoon heat.

The teaching game was over.

....

The front door chimed.

Too bright. Too energetic. The sound didn’t belong in the stale, quiet weight of the salon.

A boy burst in like he’d just found a secret level in a video game. Thirteen, maybe a little younger-looking than Lily despite being the same age. Messy hair, backpack slung off one shoulder, eyes wide with reckless excitement.

Franky looked up from the counter. “You lost, sweetheart?”

“Nope!” he said immediately. “This is the Baduk place, right? I saw it on the bus window every day and figured today’s the day.”

Franky squinted at him. “You ever play before?”

He hesitated just long enough to be honest. “Uh. No. But I’m really good at strategy games.”

Franky sighed in that tired way she had. “Ten bucks to sit at a board.”

He slapped a wrinkled bill down like it was an entrance fee to a tournament finals. “Deal.”

Lily hadn’t looked up yet.

But she had heard everything.

The words *never played before* landed in her mind with unexpected charm. The salon was empty. The teaching game was over. And for once, she wasn’t facing a redneck demon with a national title and a drinking problem.

This would be harmless.

This would be fun.

She stood.

The old man from before watched her pass and smiled faintly, already understanding. Franky noticed too—noticed the direction Lily was heading, noticed exactly who she was heading toward.

“Hey—” Franky started, her warning queued up a little too late.

Lily stopped in front of the boy.

She didn’t bow.

She didn’t gesture dramatically.

She simply pulled out a chair across from an empty board and rested two fingers on the table’s edge.

The boy blinked up at her. Processed the silence. Processed the directness.

“Oh,” he said. “You wanna play?”

Lily didn’t move.

But he smiled anyway.

Franky leaned halfway over the counter. “Kid, I should probably—”

Lily’s head turned just a fraction.

Franky froze.

She sighed. “She really does want to play you,” Franky conceded reluctantly. “I just… don’t come crying to me afterward.”

The boy’s grin widened like he thought this was hype, not a warning. He dropped into the chair with reckless confidence and stuck his hand out halfway across the table.

“Hikaru,” he said. “Nice to meet you, quiet mystery Baduk girl.”

Lily didn’t take his hand.

Instead, she reached to the side, pulled the board closer, and began laying out the stones with practiced speed.

Hikaru followed every movement like it was a magic trick. Somewhere along the way, he just… *got it*. The way she sat. The way she angled the board. The way she waited for him without impatience.

“Your name’s Lily, right?” he guessed.

She neither confirmed nor denied.

He nodded anyway. “Yeah. That tracks.”

She slid the black bowl toward him.

Then, deliberately, she touched nine empty intersections across the board.

Hikaru stared. “Whoa, wait—handicap?”

He laughed, genuinely amused. “Nah, I don’t need training wheels. I’m actually kind of cracked at this stuff.”

If Lily had facial expressions, this would have been the moment for a quiet chuckle.

Instead, she simply withdrew her hand and gave him Black.

*Your funeral,* her posture said.

Hikaru cracked his knuckles like he was about to outplay a fighting game boss and lifted a black stone with exaggerated confidence.

“Watch this.”

He placed it.

Upper right.

4–4 point.

The room didn’t react.

Franky didn’t react.

The fan rattled on.

Only Lily reacted.

Not outwardly.

But inside, something snapped sharply into attention.

That wasn’t how beginners placed stones.

That wasn’t random.

That wasn’t fear.

That was exactly the move someone made when they knew just enough to be completely misleading.

And that, right there—

—that was not a noob move at all.

.....

Lily looked at the stone.

*At least he played a 4–4,* she thought dryly.

She answered in kind. Upper left. Symmetry without commitment.

Black slid to the 3–4.

Her eyes narrowed a fraction. *Territory. So he’s ignoring komi. Fine.*

She mirrored him. Another 3–4.

He crept along the top with a low extension—safe, territorial, slow. The kind of move drilled into players a century ago.

*Yep,* she thought. *Beginner comfort zone. No fights. All cash.*

She broke the pattern and stepped boldly toward the center with a wide shimari extension—pure influence, a promise of future violence. It wasn’t subtle. It was an invitation.

He declined it completely and took low territory on the left.

Avoiding the center.

She extended inward again, shaping the faint skeleton of a moyo. Nothing solid yet—just pressure, just possibility.

Still, he ignored it. More side territory. Clean. Quiet. Accumulative.

*He really is playing like there’s no komi,* she thought. *Like it’s 1850 and points are counted with candles.*

It was strange. The positions themselves were coherent. Old-fashioned, yes—but not sloppy. And the timing…

Ten seconds.

Stone.

Pause.

Ten seconds.

Stone.

Not thinking. *Counting.*

If this were chess, she’d already be suspicious. But in Baduk? There was nothing to steal. No forced lines to memorize. Just open sky and choice.

Which made the precision unsettling.

She decided to test him.

From the center, she dropped a low kakari—casual, probing, the kind of approach any insei should welcome as a warm-up skirmish.

He answered instantly.

One-space pincer from the side.

Textbook.

Not lucky. Not random. Perfect distance.

Her first real flicker of interest stirred.

She attached without hesitation, peeling into the shape, inviting cutting complications.

And he…

Left.

Tenuki.

Didn’t even glance at the unresolved fight.

Instead, he played a reinforcement move on a group that didn’t need it.

Not the move of a beginner.

A beginner would stay. A beginner would panic over cutting points, over liberties, over the visible danger right in front of them.

There were weaknesses everywhere.

And he just abandoned them.

So she punished him.

Or at least—she *tried* to.

She wedged sharply at the cutting point in the bottom right, aiming to split his corner group clean in two. It was fast. Confident. Calculated to make him regret leaving.

Two moves later, the board told her the truth.

He hadn’t abandoned the corner.

He had *given it up*.

Deliberately.

He took sente with an outside atari so quiet it felt insulting. The corner was hers now—free, technically alive—

—but her outside stones were suffocating.

Cramped.

Strangled by their own success.

It was territory-oriented.

It was ugly.

And it worked.

Her breathing slowed.

She leaned into her side formation, trying to stabilize with a hastily formed lion’s mouth. The shape was lazy. Normally, no one would dare test it directly.

He ataried straight through it.

No hesitation. No fear.

*Yeah. That one’s on me,* she admitted silently.

She threw an emergency extension—ugly, bleeding points, desperately shoring up life where she shouldn’t have needed it.

The bottom right felt wrong now. Overcrowded. Directionless.

And for the first time in the game, Lily felt it clearly:

She needed to abandon the corner.

*Okay,* Lily thought, *no more Mrs. Nice Girl.*

Her gaze slid to the left side.

Black’s stones were spread wide there—loose by modern standards. Acceptable in antique theory. Dangerous now. The spacing invited exactly one thing.

Punishment.

She placed her pivot.

Not aggressively. Not dramatically. Just correctly—threaded between the top stone and the left-side group, a quiet wedge that promised a running fight. If he tried to use his thickness, she would stretch it until it snapped. The center influence she’d been building all game finally had teeth.

Black answered with sente on the top side.

A peep.

Right at a vital connection.

Her fingers paused over the bowl.

*Do I need to answer that…*  
A beat.  
*Yes. Yes, I do.*

She connected.

He didn’t even glance at the weak left group.

Instead, he counter-pivoted.

Mirrored her intention. Same idea. Same depth. Same cruelty.

Her stone cut.

Instantly.

Black answered from underneath with an atari—clean, forcing, exact—kicking her stones into a ladder without apology.

Her eyes moved, fast now. Counting. Projecting. The ladder should break on the right side. The angle was correct. The stone alignment—

And then she saw it.

That earlier peep.

The one she’d been forced to answer.

It had rotted the ladder’s anchor by exactly one liberty.

Her internal voice flattened.

*Fine. Take it.*

She abandoned the ladder and extended along the bottom, bleeding territory to keep something alive.

Hikaru immediately took her pivot.

Now the left side was split.

She tried to save it with an emergency extension.

Black answered in sente—*her* sente—against her.

She exhaled once through her nose.

The left group was dead.

No debate. No heroics.

But the center was still hers.

She played a calm central extension—restrained, clinical, an attempt to reassert dominance where it still existed.

Black placed a stone on the edge of the center.

And the moment Lily saw it, something cold slid through her.

That move wasn’t good.

It wasn’t even *okay.*

It was objectively awful.

Bad shape. Wrong direction. No territory. No thickness. No safety.

A mistake…

No.

A test.

The horrible realization settled with perfect clarity:

He wasn’t playing the board anymore.

He was playing *her.*

He wanted to see which direction she would attack.

Which weakness she would choose.

As if he were a player far beyond her reach.

And for the first time in the entire game, Lily felt something dangerously close to being hunted.

.....

Twenty minutes later, Hikaru slung his backpack over one shoulder like the game had been nothing more than a fun detour on his afternoon.

He stopped at the counter, still buzzing. “That was awesome,” he said easily. “I didn’t know a board game could feel like that.”

Franky smiled despite herself and tore a small flyer from the stack beside the register. “If you’re interested, there’s a junior tournament Saturday. You should check it out.”

He took it like it was a backstage pass. “Seriously? Yeah. I’ll try.”

He waved once toward the room—toward the silent girl at the board he no longer fully understood—then pushed the door open and vanished into the afternoon heat.

The bell chimed.

Franky leaned back against the counter and shook her head. “Poor kid,” she muttered. “Didn’t stand a chance.”

That’s when she noticed the sound.

Low voices. Too many of them.

She looked up.

A group had formed around Lily’s board.

Not loud. Not laughing. Focused. Tight.

Franky frowned and walked closer. “What’s going on?”

One of the old men glanced up at her, eyes still half on the board. “Game just ended.”

Franky folded her arms. “Yeah, I saw that. Lily absolutely flattened—”

“She lost.”

The word hit wrong.

Franky stared. “What.”

“Well,” another voice added carefully, “technically, with the komi, Lily won by two and a half.”

Franky blinked. “Then how the hell did she lose?”

The first man gestured at the board.

“Because nobody at this table felt like she did.”

Lily was still seated.

Hands in her lap.

Board intact.

Final position frozen in quiet violence.

Yes—by the numbers, she was ahead.

By modern rules, she had won.

But the game didn’t *feel* like a victory.

Not to the room.

And not to her.

She stared at the stones as if they belonged to someone else now.

Yes.

She won by two and a half.

But she didn’t feel like she had.

....

The champagne-gold Lexus LS400 rolled into the cracked gravel lot like it didn’t belong to the same economic universe as Seneca, South Carolina.

Peanuts spotted the boy first.

Thirteen. Backpack. Walking sideways. Talking animatedly to empty air like someone was pacing beside him just out of phase with reality. Arguing. Gesturing. Laughing at his own point.

Peanuts squinted through the windshield.  
*Strange kid.*

The Lexus horn shattered the moment.

**BEEP—BEEP.**

And then Peanuts leaned halfway out the window and unloaded her priorities on the entire county:

“**LILY, GET IN, THE X-FILES STARTS IN EIGHT, SEINFELD’S BEIN’ TAPED ON THE HQ VCR, MOM RENTED JURASSIC PARK AGAIN, KURT JUST BLEW UP MTV, AND IF I MISS THE FRIENDS RERUN BECAUSE GIA IS TRADIN’ POGS I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL LOSE IT!**”

Inside the salon, Lily’s head lifted.

The room faded.

The board.

The stones.

The circle of old men still murmuring in low disbelief.

Peanuts was here.

She stood immediately.

No bow.

No acknowledgment.

No explanation.

She walked out, pushed through the door as the bell rang uselessly behind her, and slid into the passenger seat without a word.

Peanuts punched the gas like she was fleeing a crime scene.

And immediately resumed talking.

“I swear to God, you can’t turn on the TV without seein’ that damn OJ Bronco again—every night it’s DNA this, blood drop that, lawyers arguin’ like it’s pro wrestlin’ and the trial ain’t even started yet—half the country already hung the guy, the other half thinks the LAPD planted the whole crime scene, and meanwhile we signed that NAFTA thing back in January and now everybody at the plant’s terrified their jobs are gettin’ boxed up and shipped to Mexico—Clinton smiles and says it’s the future, Perot says we’re gonna hear a ‘giant sucking sound,’ and I’m just sittin’ here wonderin’ how the hell we managed to make a murder trial and a trade agreement feel like the same damn disaster. Mark my words, this ‘Contract with America’ thing is either gonna fix everything or light the whole place on fire, and knowin’ this country it’s probably both.”

Lily wasn’t listening.

She was back at the board.

Again.

And again.

And again.

The opening replayed in perfect clarity—but every line folded back into the same impossible knot.

The pivot had been right.  
The timing had been right.  
The ladder should have worked.  
The komi math said she was safe.

And yet none of it explained how the game had slipped out of her hands without ever visibly exploding.

It was like she’d played clean, modern Go on top of a board that was secretly obeying a different physics engine—

One where sacrifices didn’t cost anything.  
Where thickness behaved like liquid steel.  
Where questions were asked with stones instead of words.

And worse than losing—

was the creeping certainty that she hadn’t lost to better tactics, or sharper reading,

but to a way of thinking that had walked straight through her assumptions without ever colliding with them.",1,1767413341.0,Shinokiba_Chatgpt,0,1.0,False

Okay so Hydroxycut Ultra Probiotic+ SX-7 combines ***traditional thermogenic ingredients*** (200mg green coffee extract, 150mg green tea) with **5 billion CFU probiotics** (B. lactis, L. acidophilus) and digestive support herbs (papaya, kiwi, fennel, ginger).

This kind of tries to bridge fat burning and gut health but ultimately delivers weak, modest results in both categories, making it a decent entry-level option for newbies or newcomers to fat burners/probiotics.

 I rate this 3.8/5, doesn’t really excel at either weight loss or probiotic efficiency compared to specialized alternatives.

5 billion CFU is LOW for a probiotic supplement.  Here is what I currently recommend over **Hydroxycut Ultra ProBiotic -**

* [**LeanBiome**](https://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/leanbiome3.php): 20 billion CFU, 9 strains – Best thermogenic probiotic for weight loss (also has green tea extract and other thermogenics)
* [**YB Gut+:**](https://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/yb3.php) 20 billion CFU, 10 strains – Best for bloating, weight loss and for women (also has digestive enzymes)
* [**Gut Vita**](https://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/gutvita.php)**:** This one is real, SOLID gut health supplement. Similar higher CFU counts with multiple strains and multi fiber blend – Best overall for comprehensive gut health & weight management in one

**Checkout my full list of recommended probiotics for weight management-**

[**https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/best-probiotics-supplements/**](https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/best-probiotics-supplements/)

 

 

**Pros & Cons**

**PROS:**

* Combines probiotics with thermogenics in one convenient product
* Low stimulant content (50-80mg caffeine) suitable for sensitive users
* Affordable price point ($25-30 for 40 servings)
* Research-backed probiotic strains (B. lactis, L. acidophilus)
* Digestive support herbs reduce bloating modestly
* No refrigeration required (shelf-stable)
* Gentle introduction to both probiotics and fat burners

**CONS:**

* **Probiotic dose too low (5B CFU vs 20B+ in competitors)**
* Only 2 probiotic strains (competitors offer 8-10+ strains)
* Thermogenic effects modest compared to dedicated fat burners
* No prebiotic fiber to support probiotic colonization
* Individual ingredient doses low (50mg herbs barely effective)
* Perilla extract inclusion questionable with limited weight loss research
* Weight loss results minimal (1-2 lbs over 6 weeks beyond diet/exercise)
* Not suitable for serious gut health issues or significant weight loss needs

 

  


**My Background With Probiotic Weight Loss Supplements**

I've experimented with probiotics for gut health for years and fat burners for even longer, but the combination of both in one supplement is a relatively new trend.

Most probiotics focus purely on digestive health (billions of CFUs, multiple strains, prebiotics), while fat burners emphasize thermogenics and stimulants. Products claiming to do both typically compromise on one or both fronts.

Hydroxycut's approach—adding 5 billion CFU probiotics to their traditional green coffee/green tea thermogenic formula—caught my attention because it represents the mainstream supplement industry's attempt to capitalize on the gut-health-weight-loss connection without fully committing to either category. At \~$25-30 for 40 servings, it's positioned as an affordable ""best of both worlds"" option.

  


# My 6-Week Experience with SX-7 Black Onyx (and what you can expect too)

**Week 1-2: Mild Energy, Digestive Adjustment**

Taking 2 capsules daily (as recommended) before breakfast provided gentle energy—noticeable but not intense. Similar to drinking a weak cup of coffee. No jitters or anxiety, which was positive for a stimulant-containing product.

Appetite suppression was minimal—maybe slightly less hungry mid-morning, but nothing like the powerful appetite control from high-dose glucomannan or pharmaceutical appetite suppressants.

The probiotic component caused mild digestive adjustment—slight gas and bloating for 3-4 days, which is normal when introducing probiotics. This subsided by day 5-6.

**Week 3-4: Stabilized Effects**

By week 3, any placebo-driven enthusiasm had worn off. The energy remained mild and consistent—helpful for workouts but not transformative. The thermogenic effect was subtle—maybe felt slightly warmer during exercise.

Digestive improvements were modest. I didn't experience dramatic bloating reduction or digestive transformation. My digestion felt... normal. Not worse, not dramatically better. The 5 billion CFU probiotic dose simply isn't enough to create major gut microbiome changes.

Weight loss after 4 weeks: 2-3 pounds. Realistically, maybe 0.5-1 pound was attributable to the supplement beyond what my diet and exercise would have achieved alone.

**Week 5-6: Diminishing Returns**

By week 5-6, tolerance to the mild stimulants had developed. The energy boost felt less pronounced. Appetite suppression remained minimal. No additional digestive benefits emerged.

Total weight loss over 6 weeks: 4 pounds. This aligns with realistic expectations for green coffee/green tea combinations—modest support, not dramatic transformation.

  


# What You're Actually Getting with Hydroxycut probiotic for weight loss

**Green Coffee/Robusta Extract (200mg, 45% Chlorogenic Acids)**

This provides 90mg chlorogenic acids, the primary ""fat burning"" component. I've used green coffee extract in various doses, and the research shows modest effects—maybe 2-4 pounds additional weight loss over 12 weeks in studies. From my experience, it provides very mild metabolism support and slight appetite reduction—nothing dramatic but not useless either.

**Green Tea Extract (150mg with EGCG)**

Provides catechins and natural caffeine (probably 30-50mg per serving). Combined with green coffee's caffeine (estimated 20-30mg), you're looking at 50-80mg total—roughly half a cup of coffee. From my experience, this creates gentle energy and mild thermogenic effects but nothing intense. The EGCG supports fat oxidation during exercise modestly.

**Probiotic Blend (5 Billion CFU)**

Here's where things get problematic. 5 billion CFU is LOW for a probiotic supplement. Compare this to:

* LeanBiome: 20 billion CFU, 9 strains
* YourBiology Gut+: 20 billion CFU, 10 strains
* Gut Vita: Similar higher CFU counts with multiple strains

The two strains included (B. lactis BL-04, L. acidophilus NCFM) are legitimate, research-backed strains for gut health and bloating reduction.

However, at only 5 billion CFU total split between two strains, the probiotic component feels more like marketing addition than therapeutic dose.

**Digestive Support Herbs (Papaya, Kiwi, Fennel, Ginger)**

Each at 50mg—these are token amounts adding digestive enzyme support (papaya), vitamin C (kiwi), anti-bloating effects (fennel), and nausea relief (ginger). From my experience with digestive supplements, 50mg of each herb provides mild benefits at best. It's enough to claim ""digestive support"" on the label but not enough for dramatic effects.

**Perilla Extract (150mg)**

This is an unusual addition—perilla is traditionally used for respiratory support and has some anti-inflammatory properties. Its role in weight loss is unclear with limited research. This feels like a proprietary ingredient added for differentiation rather than proven effectiveness.

  


# How to Actually Use Probiotics for Weight Loss

If you're serious about using probiotics for weight loss (whether this product or better alternatives), here's what actually works:

**Realistic Expectations:**

* Probiotics support weight loss indirectly (improved digestion, reduced inflammation, better nutrient absorption)
* Direct fat burning from probiotics is minimal—expect 1-3 lbs additional loss over 12 weeks at most
* Benefits accumulate over months, not days

**Proper Usage Protocol:**

* Take consistently daily for minimum 8-12 weeks (gut microbiome changes require time)
* Take with food to protect probiotics from stomach acid
* Combine with prebiotic fiber (5-10g daily) to feed good bacteria
* Stay hydrated (80-100oz water daily)
* Support with whole food diet rich in fermented foods

**Maximize Probiotic Effectiveness:**

* Choose products with 20+ billion CFU minimum
* Look for multiple strains (8-10+ strains better than 2)
* Prioritize strains with weight loss research: L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus, B. lactis
* Ensure shelf-stable or properly refrigerated storage
* Avoid combining with antibiotics (kills probiotics)

**Dietary Synergy:**

* Reduce processed foods and added sugars (feeds bad bacteria)
* Include prebiotic foods: onions, garlic, asparagus, bananas, oats
* Eat fermented foods: yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi
* Maintain caloric deficit for actual weight loss (probiotics support, don't replace this)

  


# Comparing to Other Probiotic Weight Loss Supplements

**Vs. LeanBiome (20B CFU, 9 Strains + Green Tea Phytosome):**

* **LeanBiome:** 4x more probiotics, better strain variety, includes metabolism boosters
* **Hydroxycut SX-7 Black Onyx:** Lower probiotic dose, adds thermogenics, more affordable
* **Winner:** LeanBiome for anyone serious about probiotic weight loss support

**Vs. Gut Vita (Higher CFU + Digestive Fibers):**

* **Gut Vita:** Focuses on digestive health with glucomannan, apple pectin, prune powder
* **Hydroxycut SX-7 Black Onyx:** Adds thermogenic stimulants, lower probiotic dose
* **Winner:** Gut Vita for digestive issues; Hydroxycut for mild energy boost

**Vs. ProBioSlim (Similar Concept, Different Execution):**

* **ProBioSlim:** Also combines probiotics with weight loss ingredients
* **Hydroxycut SX-7 Black Onyx:** Better brand recognition, similar modest effectiveness
* **Winner:** Essentially tied—both are entry-level probiotic weight loss options

**Vs. YourBiology Gut+ (20B CFU, 10 Strains + Enzymes + D3):**

* **YourBiology:** Comprehensive gut health with digestive enzymes, vitamin D3, prebiotic blend
* **Hydroxycut:** Cheaper, adds thermogenics, lower probiotic dose
* **Winner:** YourBiology for comprehensive gut health and women's wellness

**Vs. Pure Thermogenic Fat Burners (Hydroxycut Hardcore, Instant Knockout):**

* **Pure Thermogenics:** Far more aggressive fat burning, higher stimulants
* **Hydroxycut Ultra Probiotic:** Gentler, adds digestive support, lower effectiveness
* **Winner:** Pure thermogenics for fat loss; this for gentle combined approach

  


# Who Should (And Shouldn't) Try This

**IDEAL FOR:**

* Beginners wanting gentle introduction to fat burners + probiotics
* Those with mild bloating who also want slight metabolism boost
* Budget-conscious users ($25-30 vs $50-60 for specialized options)
* People sensitive to stimulants (only 50-80mg caffeine estimated)
* Users wanting ""all-in-one"" approach without committing to higher doses
* Those already taking separate probiotics and fat burners who want to consolidate

**NOT IDEAL FOR:**

* Serious gut health issues (5B CFU too low—need 20-50B+ CFU)
* Those wanting significant weight loss support (thermogenic dose modest)
* People with IBS, chronic constipation, or severe digestive problems
* Users needing high-dose probiotics for microbiome restoration
* Anyone expecting dramatic results from either probiotic or fat burning components
* Those on tight budgets better off buying separate specialized products

  


# How to Pick the Best Probiotic for Weight Loss

**Identify Your Primary Goal:**

**Gut Health Priority:**

* Choose 20+ billion CFU, 8-10+ strains
* Look for prebiotics included (inulin, FOS)
* Examples: YourBiology Gut+, Garden of Life

**Weight Loss Priority:**

* Seek strains with weight loss research (L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus)
* Bonus: metabolism boosters (green tea, green coffee)
* Examples: LeanBiome, Provitalize

**Digestive Issues + Weight Loss:**

* Need digestive enzymes + fiber + probiotics
* Look for comprehensive formulas
* Examples: Gut Vita, YourBiology Gut+

**Budget-Conscious Combined Approach:**

* Accept lower doses of both probiotics and thermogenics
* Examples: Hydroxycut Ultra Probiotic, ProBioSlim

**Check These Factors:**

* **CFU Count:** Minimum 10B for mild effects, 20-50B for significant gut changes
* **Strain Variety:** More strains = broader benefits (aim for 5+ minimum)
* **Research-Backed Strains:** L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus, B. lactis for weight support
* **Additional Ingredients:** Prebiotics, enzymes, metabolism boosters enhance effectiveness
* **Storage Requirements:** Shelf-stable more convenient than refrigerated
* **Price Per CFU:** Calculate cost-effectiveness (higher CFU often better value)

  


# My Final Performance Ratings For This Probiotic

**Probiotic Effectiveness: 2.8/5** \- 5B CFU too low for significant gut microbiome changes.

**Weight Loss Support: 3.5/5** \- Green coffee/green tea provide modest thermogenic effects.

**Digestive Improvement: 3.2/5** \- Mild bloating reduction from probiotics + digestive herbs.

**Energy Enhancement: 3.4/5** \- Gentle caffeine boost equivalent to half cup coffee.

**Appetite Suppression: 2.5/5** \- Minimal hunger control compared to glucomannan-based products.

**Value for Money: 3.8/5** \- Affordable for combined approach but compromises on both fronts.

**Safety Profile: 4.2/5** \- Low stimulants, generally well-tolerated probiotics, minimal side effects.

   


# My Final Verdict

Hydroxycut Ultra Probiotic+ earns its 3.8/5 rating by being a decent but not exceptional attempt at combining weight loss and gut health support in one affordable package. It's the supplement equivalent of a Swiss Army knife—does multiple things adequately but none exceptionally well.

The 5 billion CFU probiotic dose is too low to create significant gut microbiome changes that dedicated probiotic users need. The thermogenic ingredients (green coffee, green tea) provide modest metabolism support but nothing approaching serious fat burners. The digestive herbs add mild bloating relief but at homeopathic 50mg doses.

**My recommendation:** This works as an entry-level ""combined approach"" product for people who want gentle fat burning support with basic digestive benefits and don't want to buy separate specialized products.

If you're new to both probiotics and fat burners, starting here isn't terrible—you'll get mild benefits in both categories without overwhelming side effects or financial commitment.

However, if you're serious about either gut health OR weight loss, invest in specialized products. For gut health, choose LeanBiome (20B CFU, 9 strains) or YourBiology Gut+ (comprehensive formula with enzymes).

For weight loss, choose Hunter Burn (clinical glucomannan + carb blocking) or dedicated thermogenics if you tolerate stimulants well.

**Bottom line:** Hydroxycut Ultra Probiotic+ is like ordering a ""combination plate"" at a restaurant—you get a taste of everything but master portions of nothing. It's convenient and affordable but compromises effectiveness on both fronts. For casual users wanting gentle combined support, it's acceptable. For serious gut health restoration or significant weight loss, look elsewhere.

The Magnifica Plus seems like a very solid and reliable choice, and I heard it is highly effective at making a really intense espresso with a larger dose of coffee. On the other hand, the Rivelia is at an unbeatable price right now and has that cool Bean Switch system where you can swap out the whole hopper for different beans. 

I am curious if anyone here has tried both? Is the Rivelia a bit too plasticky, or are the extra features like the Bean Adapt technology worth the extra few dollars? 

I have fact-checked the main specs to help me compare them, but I would love to hear what you guys think about the actual coffee quality and how easy they are to clean every day:

De'Longhi Magnifica Plus (ECAM32070SB) – 18 recipes, 15-bar pressure, and known for the most intense espresso shots, for $1,099.95

I am personally leaning toward the Magnifica Plus because $1,099.95 is a smart price for a machine that focuses so much on the strength of the espresso. 

What about you guys? Which one would you pick for a 2026 home setup?

All of the bugs and the false positives has since been rectified and this release would be the first stable release of the game. The game has **No ads, sign-ups or downloads and is completely free-to-play**. enjoy!

the official secure URL for the game is: [https://cricket-manager.com](https://cricket-manager.com/)

**Note for Players**: Please use the ""Feedback"" button in the header if you encounter any bugs or have any thoughts about the game. and please feel free to criticize! It would greatly help me to identify things to improve upon

**Note for potential collaborators**: As mentioned earlier, I am a sole developer and would love to have more hands on deck, be it for UI/UX, Gamedev, Marketing or anything else at all. Please note that the game is meant to be open source and there is no monetary incentive apart from donations (which will be 100% funnelled back into the game). I strongly believe that a collaborative project would be the best way to make the game grow and my DMs are open to anyone else who sees the potential of the game and would like to help out in any way possible!",1,1767412564.0,IndieGaming,1,1.0,False
1q2k8xb,https://i.redd.it/l92y1a6f42bg1.jpeg,I can’t find a non-plastic pour over that has a large enough base to fit over my large mugs.,"My 3 favorite mugs are about 4.5 inches in diameter. I’d really love to able to just brew coffee right over them but most of the pour overs I’m seeing online have a base that is only around 3.8 inches, 4.2 max. There is one - it’s the “Big Joe” pour over but it’s black plastic and I just know that would bum me out every morning lol. Ceramic would be my first choice but stainless steel / glass would also work. Just not plastic. The thing that’s making it hard to find what I’m looking for is often times the retailer will not list how large the base is. I always see the height and width of the top part listed, the size of the filter it uses, along with other random dimensions but the most important one to me is often not in the description. Any suggestions and/or brand recommendations are greatly appreciated! Thank you! ",0,1767412382.0,pourover,6,0.17,False
1q2k7pp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2k7pp,SoS Vishnu:  what to focus on?,"I got to 7\* last season and couldn't get close to promotion. This time, I've got basically everybody recommended, but still underbuilt. I'm currently #887. I'd gotten \~11m at the start of the season using Minami, Futaba, and the default twins' personas, and I'm at \~15.5 currently using Cherish and Wind.

My wonder lvl is s-18, I ran R6 Ex Machina w/ Lilith, Titania (w/ tarukaja) and Surt (Dio/Dominion/Shiva are on pt 2). Sustain with Cherish was an issue, his S3 only does \~4500 shielding, so Wonder had to heal between shields.

I've got mats to get either Minami or Cherish and weapon to 80, but not both. I'm 20 crystals short of the price for the anni weapon selector, so could get Wind's 5\* and I could r6 Cherish's 4\*. I'm waiting til Sunday to finish doing the Twins' skills, and I can max out a few other skills, but I've already cleaned out the event, cognition and tycoon shops for the month and am basically out of incense right now. I've got \~60 rev selectors and plenty of coffee, but I've been spending too much of my resources this last week buffing my lowest ratings for the Thieves' Den items and grinding for power/victory cards for the twins and S. Moko.

What should I prioritize over the next few days?",1,1767412281.0,personaphantomx,1,1.0,False

I’ve had two severe depressive episodes, one manic episode with psychotic features and one full blown psychotic episode that all required hospitalization.

But today I just feel….really good. I only slept five hours last night, I did a really good job at work, I was getting tasks done at work super fast, the day flew by. I work ten hours and it felt like it took two hours. I went shopping and that took me 45 minutes. I usually look at so many things and spend too much money. I stuck to my shopping list. But I had to get to an AA meeting so that’s why I was rushing. I was very talkative at the meeting and all day I’ve just been thinking “I’m I hypomanic or something?”

I didn’t speed when I was driving. I only ate a protein bar today, lots of coffee and water. I just feel so good, I have lots of energy and I want to talk to people. Maybe it’s the coffee.

As I’m writing this, it sounds hypomanic but I sometimes have trouble deciphering how I feel before things get out of hand.

1q2k72c,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q2k72c/i_killed_someone_in_a_story_his_body_was_just/,I killed someone in a story. His body was just found.,"I’ve been writing for quite some time now. 

I can still remember being a kid in school and reading my first scary story. From that moment on, I was hooked. I looked for these stories, fiendishly, and, very quickly, they became the only thing circling my brain *constantly*.

Naturally, once I discovered this form of expression, it was only a matter of time before I tried my hand at it myself. 

I felt I had a general grasp on what a good story should look like; pay attention to pacing, make things natural, and, most importantly, *finish* it. 

That being said, I recently wrote a story regarding murder. More specifically, the murder of an elderly jogger who just so happened to be a key witness in the story. 

He was set to testify against some important people, and I was tasked with tying up loose ends, if you know what I mean. 

I was trying to write a crime novel but I’m not Agatha Christie, I just figured I’d give some mystery writing a try. 

I’m getting sidetracked. 

Basically, while he jogged his normal route, as he did every morning; I drove up a mile ahead and set up some thin metal wire that stretched from one tree to another across the path. Directly at neck level…

I wrote my character as this sort of private eye/ mercenary type…thing- listen, I already told you, I’m not Agatha Christie. 

Anywho, I say this because I made him do research, right? I made him know his stuff, is all.

More specifically, I made him know that this jogger jogged at an average pace of 5 miles an hour and that his jugular would be exactly 5 feet and 4 inches from the ground. 

All that “knowing” I did, yet, as I watched the jogger slam into the wire and get clotheslined to his butt, the blood wasn’t coming out at nearly the speed I thought it would. 

In fact, the jogger just sat there, rubbing his neck and becoming absolutely flabbergasted as he drew his hand back from his throat and saw the watery, red blood coating his palm.

In a state of animalistic fear after noticing the wire, his eyes darted around wildly as he rose to his feet. 

Afraid of my target's escape, I quickly jumped from the bush where I hid, waiting to snap a picture of his corpse once the job was completed. 

His eyes lit up with fear as I knocked him down to his back, quickly analyzing the area to make sure no one was around. 

As the old man struggled, I unhooked the wire from one of the trees and wrapped it around his neck. 

I pulled as hard as I could and heard flesh tearing and veins ripping as the man's struggling grunts turned to gurgles, and the sound of running shoes seizing against concrete filled the air. 

Once his feet stopped kicking and his body went completely limp, I removed the wire from his neck. He was nearly decapitated as he lay there on the vacant trail. 

The sounds of nature continued. Birds sang to the backdrop of gently trickling water from a nearby stream as the man's blood leaked further and further down the concrete path.

As I said, my character had to take photos upon the job's completion, so that’s what he did.  

I snapped a few shots from various angles before rolling up the wire and hurrying back to my old Volkswagen, covered head to toe in blood.

Again, I AM NOT A MYSTERY WRITER. 

Like, I didn’t even begin to think about all the DNA evidence that’d be collected from the scene, the amount of witnesses that would’ve been around in such a public space, and don’t even get me started on the fact that he just, what? Left the old man there on the trail for people to find and report? Pick a lane right? 

That’s exactly what I thought too. 

And that’s exactly why I DELETED that story. Moved it to the trash bin immediately after reading it, utterly ashamed of myself, I must say. 

I 100 percent planned on just calling it a night, and picking up on a new story the next day; one that I felt confident in. 

As I lay in bed, drifting into sleep, it felt as though my eyes were closed for mere moments before the booming sound of knocks came thumping from my front door. Sunlight filled my room, and as I groggily made my way towards the door, the rhythmic knocking abruptly stopped. 

When I opened the door, there was no one there, not even in the hallway. 

However…there were some Polaroid photos placed carefully on my welcome mat.

They were of the old man, exactly how I’d imagined him and exactly how I’d mutilated him. All taken from the exact angles as from the story.

I couldn’t move for a brief moment as I stared down at them, disgusted at how they decorated the mat.

I quickly gathered my thoughts and scooped up each of the 6 photos. 

Lying them out on the coffee table, I sat on the couch with a “this can’t possibly be happening” look on my face, and my head fell into my hands as the realization hit me. 

Flipping on the TV, I turned to the news just in time to see the headline:

KEY WITNESS IN RICO CASE FOUND BRUTALLY MURDERED ON PARK TRAIL IN ATLANTA

“Welp,” I thought to myself. “It was fun while it lasted.” 

Look, I’m writing this now because I’m not sure when my next story will be. I can hear the tactical boots of a SWAT team rushing up the stairs in my building, and I’m sure I know exactly where they’re headed.

1q2k5pj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2k5pj,Managing task paralysis esp for ADHD,"**Planning stage:**

**1. Awareness and insight:** Being aware when you want to do the task but have difficulty to get started. Give yourself time to introspect (think internally that you are experiencing it, it's okay to experience what you're going through, remind yourself that you are going to get up in next 5 - 10 minutes and get started, and think of the feeling of happiness once the task would be done).

Task paralysis often masks fear of judgment, perfectionism, or uncertainty about how to proceed. Name the real obstacle so you can address it.

**2. Too much on your plate with equal importance:** If you want to do too many things all at the same time, not much would get done. Use the Eisenhower matrix to categorize which tasks are important and which one can be put at a later time. People with ADHD can struggle to get tasks done that are important compared to tasks that are interesting. To help overcome this, follow step 3 below.

**3. Know your rewards and how to incorporate these in task:** Knowing which things make you happy and interested and incorporating these in the task. Sometimes starting with a rewarding task can help us to get up which can break the stuck phase. Similarly, a change in environment can be helpful. Remember that rewards need to be 'in between' or in the 'background' of the task and not become a main focus or be in the foreground.

**4.** **Create a layout of the task:** First identify the expected final outcome e.g. ""I've to clean the dishes"". Now imagine/ visualize the overall structure, steps, outline of the tasks that need to be done. Remember to keep the list basic and short so it doesn't lead to task paralysis again.

If there is a complex or difficult task, you can use [https://goblin.tools/](https://goblin.tools/) to break any task into do-able steps.

**Getting started:**

**5. Getting ready to do it:** What makes you fresh? Is it a shower, going for a walk, coffee, music, playing with a pet etc. Start on a positive note, doing something unrelated sets the motion to then begin the task.

**6. Setting (realistic) time limits:** Set realistic time limit to do the task while incorporating for mini short breaks, brief time adjustments for distractions and try to stick with those time limits. Ensure that you add buffer (some empty time slot) in between different tasks so if you couldn't finish 1 task on time, you have some extra time to make up for it, without impacting the other task.

**7. Start small or with an interesting part of the task.** Try starting the task which might even involve looking at the task, putting together the items needed to start the task, or even doing the easiest, most interesting part of the task first. For example, if you've to make a presentation, just choose background colour or slide colour can help to get your mind ready to get into it.

**8. Be on the lookout:** Be aware of any distractions, tiredness, mental fatigue, or need for perfection.

**9.** **Save fine tuning for later.** Remind yourself of the layout / final outcome and use it to complete most of the task. The most important job is to create a structure, a skeleton on which you can add more things later. If you start focussing on perfection here, other parts of the task may get delayed.

**10. Remind, Reassure and Reward yourself:** Take multiple short breaks/ pauses, look at the progress you've made, and look at the expected outcome of the that you identified in step 4. Give yourself praise for getting started. If you're following checklist or task steps, it might be helpful to cross off the steps you've completed. Remember some progress is better than no progress.

I take a break of 1 minute after every 5 minutes of studying. It doesn't involve me leaving the study place, just sitting there, but try to think of a happy positive and relaxing memory.

**11. Know help is available:** You can always come back to a task later, ask someone you trust for help for overcoming any hurdle or difficulty with the task.

**12. Use body doubling.** Work alongside someone else (in person or virtually), even if they're doing something completely different. The presence of another person can activate your focus. Alternatively, tell someone you'll share your progress by a specific time, or schedule a meeting that requires the task's completion.

**Task completion:**

**13. Do take time to relax, or a bigger break or reward:** Give yourself permission to rest, relax and take a bigger break to reward yourself for attempting to do the task. Remember every bit of step that you took brought you closer to success.

**14. Reflect:** What worked, what was helpful, what were the distractions and were you able to timely identify and resolve these? Task paralysis often worsens under time pressure. If this task took longer to start than expected, factor that delay into future planning.",1,1767412123.0,saudipsychology,0,1.0,False

1q2k4t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFriendsFriendsClub/comments/1q2k4t2/my_experience_with_applied_nutrition_green_tea/,My Experience with Applied Nutrition Green Tea Triple Fat Burner & Review: 3.4/5,"**Rating: 3.4/5** | So [Applied Nutrition's Triple Fat Burner](https://appliednutrition.com/products/green-tea-triple-fat-burner) combines three tea types (green, black, white) delivering 300mg total EGCG plus 160mg caffeine with added B-vitamins and antioxidants. Expect noticeable energy boost, mild thermogenic effects (50-120 extra calories burned daily), and modest appetite suppression over 4 weeks.

Max realistic weight loss of 2-3 pounds when combined with proper diet and exercise.

The ""triple tea"" blend provides slightly more comprehensive antioxidant support than standard green tea-only formulas, though the core fat-burning mechanism remains the same caffeine-EGCG combination.

Overall, this is like marginally improved green tea fat burner, but still moderate performer in the crowded green tea fat burner category.

For better results, I recommend [**this advanced green tea caffeine fat burner**](https://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phen10.php) (caffeine combined with ALA + capsaicin + l-carnitine).

**Also checkout all my recommended fat burners here –**

[**https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/best-otc-thermogenic-fat-burners/**](https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/best-otc-thermogenic-fat-burners/)

 

**Pros & Cons**

**PROS:**

* Higher EGCG dose (300mg) than standard green tea fat burners
* Genuine energy enhancement from 160mg caffeine
* B-vitamins support energy metabolism
* Improved workout performance and endurance
* Mild appetite suppression aids diet adherence
* Triple tea blend provides diverse antioxidant profile
* Liquid soft-gel format may enhance absorption

**CONS:**

* Tolerance develops rapidly (4-6 weeks)
* High caffeine causes jitters, anxiety in sensitive users
* Significant sleep disruption if taken after early afternoon
* ""Triple tea"" premium not justified by dramatically better results
* Weight loss modest (1 lb attributable over 4 weeks)
* Not suitable for caffeine-sensitive or cardiovascular-compromised individuals
* Overpriced versus buying standalone EGCG and caffeine

  


**My Background With Green Tea Fat Burners**

I've experimented with green tea-based fat burners for years, from basic 250mg green tea extract capsules to aggressive **500mg+ EGCG formulas** combined with various stimulants. I've tried standalone green tea, matcha powders, green tea combined with garcinia cambogia, CLA, raspberry ketones—the full spectrum of what the supplement industry markets for fat loss.

What I've learned through extensive experimentation is that green tea extract works modestly but genuinely when dosed properly (270-400mg EGCG daily) and combined with adequate caffeine (100-200mg). The fat-burning effects aren't dramatic—you're looking at maybe 50-100 extra calories burned daily, not the dramatic transformations marketing suggests.

The real value is enhanced workout performance, mild appetite control, and antioxidant support that collectively make diet adherence easier.

Applied Nutrition's ""Triple Fat Burner"" marketing caught my attention because most green tea fat burners use only green tea extract. The ***combination of green, black, and white tea*** sounded innovative, though I suspected it might be more marketing than meaningful enhancement over standard green tea formulas.

  


**What Applied Nutrition Triple Fat Burner Delivers**

This is fundamentally a higher-dose EGCG formula (300mg total from three tea types) combined with moderate caffeine (160mg) plus B-vitamins for energy metabolism support. The ""triple tea"" approach provides 200mg each of green, black, and white tea extracts, all standardized to 50% EGCG (100mg EGCG per tea type).

From a biochemical perspective, EGCG is EGCG regardless of whether it comes from green, black, or white tea. The primary difference between tea types is processing method and resulting antioxidant profiles—green tea is minimally oxidized preserving maximum catechins, white tea is least processed with delicate flavor, and black tea is fully oxidized with different polyphenol compositions. All three contain EGCG, though green tea typically has the highest natural concentration.

The 300mg total EGCG represents a strong dose—higher than the standard 200mg found in most competing products. Combined with 160mg caffeine (equivalent to about 1.5-2 cups of coffee), this creates a genuine thermogenic effect. The added B-vitamins (B6, B12, niacin, folate) support energy metabolism, which makes sense in a fat burner formula. The vitamin C and E provide additional antioxidant support.

  


# What to Expect: My 4-Week Experience

**Week 1: Initial Energy Surge**

You'd expect immediate, noticeable energy enhancement within 20-30 minutes of taking two soft-gels. The 160mg caffeine provides genuine stimulation—increased alertness, improved focus, and readiness for workouts. For someone caffeine-sensitive or not accustomed to stimulants, this dose will feel quite strong, possibly causing jitteriness or mild anxiety.

I experienced enhanced workout performance from day one—better endurance, improved strength output, and that focused ""mind-muscle connection"" that makes training more productive. The thermogenic effect was subtle but present—you'd notice slightly elevated body temperature and perhaps increased sweating during exercise.

Appetite suppression appeared within the first few days. Not dramatic hunger elimination, but you'd find it easier to delay meals or resist snacking between planned eating times. Taking the supplement on an empty stomach caused mild nausea (common with concentrated green tea), so pairing it with at least a small amount of food is advisable.

**Week 2: Steady Performance, Minor Side Effects**

By week two, your body adapts to the stimulant dose somewhat. The initial jittery feeling typically subsides, but energy enhancement remains consistent. You'd continue noticing improved workout quality—the supplement makes training feel more productive and less like a grind.

Expect modest weight loss during this period—maybe 1-1.5 pounds. Realistically, perhaps 0.5 pounds of this is attributable to the supplement's thermogenic effects beyond what diet and exercise alone would achieve. The rest comes from the lifestyle factors the supplement supports: better workout performance, easier appetite control, enhanced motivation to stick with your plan.

Sleep quality becomes an issue if you take this product after early afternoon. I learned through uncomfortable experience that 160mg caffeine taken at 2-3pm significantly disrupts sleep onset and depth that night. The caffeine half-life means substantial amounts remain in your system 6-8 hours later, interfering with natural sleep patterns.

**Week 3: Continued Benefits, Emerging Tolerance**

Around week three, you'd notice the energy boost becoming less pronounced—a sign that stimulant tolerance is developing. The supplement still provides benefits, but that initial dramatic surge diminishes. This is inevitable with caffeine-based products; your body adapts and effects moderate over time.

The appetite suppression remains helpful but also feels less powerful than initially. You'd still find it easier to control portions and resist cravings compared to not using the supplement, but the effect isn't as strong as week one.

Workout performance continues benefiting from the ***EGCG and caffeine combination***. Fat oxidation during exercise—your body's ability to burn fat for fuel—remains enhanced. You'd notice better endurance and that satisfying ""pump"" during resistance training.

**Week 4: Plateauing Effects**

By week four, tolerance to the stimulant effects becomes quite evident. The energy enhancement feels significantly diminished compared to your first week. You'd need to either increase the dose (risking more side effects) or cycle off the product for 2-4 weeks to reset tolerance.

Total weight loss over four weeks: expect approximately 2.5-3 pounds. Realistically, maybe 1 pound of this is directly attributable to the supplement's thermogenic effects beyond what your diet and exercise program alone would achieve. The primary value isn't dramatic fat burning—it's the enhanced workout quality, improved appetite control, and metabolic support that make your overall fat loss efforts more effective and sustainable.

The antioxidant support from the triple tea blend and vitamins C and E provides benefits you wouldn't immediately notice but accumulate over time: reduced exercise-induced oxidative stress, better recovery, and cellular protection supporting long-term health.

  


# Breaking Down Key Ingredients

**Triple Tea Blend (300mg EGCG total)**

The 300mg EGCG from combined green, black, and white tea represents a strong dose—50% higher than the typical 200mg found in standard green tea fat burners. From my experience with various EGCG doses, 300mg pushes into the range where benefits are more noticeable but side effects (nausea, digestive discomfort) also become more likely if taken without food.

The ""triple tea"" marketing is clever but somewhat misleading. EGCG is EGCG biochemically, regardless of source. The different tea types do provide slightly different antioxidant profiles—white tea contains more delicate catechins, black tea provides theaflavins and thearubigins from oxidation—but the primary fat-burning mechanism remains the EGCG-caffeine combination stimulating thermogenesis and fat oxidation.

That said, the diverse antioxidant profile from three tea types theoretically provides broader cellular protection than green tea alone. Whether this translates to meaningfully better results is questionable, but it's not purely marketing nonsense either.

**Caffeine (160mg)**

This is a substantial caffeine dose equivalent to about 1.5-2 cups of strong coffee. For regular caffeine consumers (200-300mg daily like myself), 160mg feels energizing without being overwhelming. For caffeine-naive individuals or those sensitive to stimulants, this dose will feel quite intense—potential rapid heartbeat, jitteriness, anxiety, or even mild panic in extreme cases.

The caffeine-EGCG combination is synergistic for fat burning—they enhance each other's thermogenic effects. However, this also means more potential for stimulant-related side effects. The 160mg dose also guarantees sleep disruption if taken within 6-8 hours of bedtime.

**B-Vitamins (B6, B12, Niacin, Folate)**

B-vitamins support energy metabolism at the cellular level—they're cofactors in the biochemical pathways converting food to usable energy. The 100% daily value doses here are appropriate and beneficial, particularly for people whose diets might be deficient in these nutrients.

From my experience, adequate B-vitamins create stable baseline energy rather than stimulant-type energy. You won't feel a dramatic surge like with caffeine, but over weeks, B-vitamin sufficiency prevents that cellular fatigue where you're exhausted regardless of sleep or rest.

**Vitamins C & E**

These antioxidants protect against exercise-induced oxidative stress and support immune function. The doses here (140mg vitamin C, 10-15mg vitamin E) are moderate—helpful but not megadose levels. They provide genuine benefit for people training hard, supporting recovery and reducing inflammation.

  


# My Performance Ratings (1-5 Scale)

**Fat Burning: 3.3/5** \- Higher EGCG dose (300mg) provides slightly better thermogenic effects than standard 200mg formulas; realistic 70-120 extra calories burned daily.

**Energy Enhancement: 4.0/5** \- 160mg caffeine delivers genuine, noticeable energy boost excellent for pre-workout use.

**Appetite Suppression: 3.3/5** \- Mild but real appetite control helpful for diet adherence; not dramatic suppression.

**Workout Performance: 3.9/5** \- Enhanced endurance, strength, and fat oxidation during training; noticeable improvement.

**Antioxidant Support: 3.7/5** \- Triple tea blend plus vitamins C & E provide comprehensive antioxidant protection.

**Safety Profile: 3.1/5** \- High caffeine dose causes jitters, anxiety, sleep issues in sensitive individuals.

**Value for Money: 3.5/5** – Moderate value for the benefits offered;  

**Formula Quality: 3.5/5** \- Well-formulated core (EGCG, caffeine, B-vitamins); triple tea approach marginally better than single-source.

  


**My Overall Rating: 3.4/5 Stars**

Applied Nutrition's Triple Fat Burner is a competent mid-range stimulant thermogenic that delivers on its core promises: energy enhancement, mild fat burning support, and improved workout performance.

The 300mg EGCG dose is legitimately higher than most competitors, and the added B-vitamins make sense for energy metabolism support.

However, the ""triple tea"" marketing oversells the innovation. While combining green, black, and white tea provides slightly more diverse antioxidants than green tea alone, the core fat-burning mechanism remains identical: EGCG plus caffeine stimulating thermogenesis.

The realistic benefits over standard green tea fat burners are marginal—maybe 10-20% better results, not the dramatic improvement the premium pricing suggests.

This product works adequately for what it is: ***a properly dosed stimulant fat burner providing real but modest benefits.*** Expect enhanced energy, better workouts, mild appetite control, and maybe 1 pound of additional fat loss over 4 weeks beyond what diet and exercise alone achieve. 

***Tolerance development is inevitable***, requiring cycling to maintain effectiveness.

For caffeine-tolerant individuals seeking pre-workout stimulation and modest metabolic support, this delivers acceptable value.

However, it's not exceptional enough to justify significant premium over cheaper alternatives or standalone EGCG and caffeine supplements. NOT dramatically better than Applied Nutrition’s regular green tea fat burner.

1q2k4rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1q2k4rc/i_killed_someone_in_a_story_his_body_was_just/,I killed someone in a story. His body was just found.,"I’ve been a writer for quite some time now. I can still remember being a kid in school and reading my first scary story. From that moment on, I was hooked. I looked for these stories, fiendishly, and, very quickly, they became the only thing circling my brain *constantly*.

Naturally, once I discovered this form of expression, it was only a matter of time before I tried my hand at it myself. 

I felt I had a general grasp on what a good story should look like; pay attention to pacing, make things natural, and, most importantly, *finish* it. 

That being said, I recently wrote a story regarding murder. More specifically, the murder of an elderly jogger who just so happened to be a key witness in the story. 

He was set to testify against some important people, and I was tasked with tying up loose ends, if you know what I mean. 

I was trying to write a crime novel but I’m not Agatha Christie, I just figured I’d give some mystery writing a try. 

I’m getting sidetracked. 

Basically, while he jogged his normal route, as he did every morning; I drove up a mile ahead and set up some thin metal wire that stretched from one tree to another across the path. Directly at neck level…

I wrote my character as this sort of private eye/ mercenary type…thing- listen, I already told you, I’m not Agatha Christie. 

Anywho, I say this because I made him do research, right? I made him know his stuff, is all.

More specifically, I made him know that this jogger jogged at an average pace of 5 miles an hour and that his jugular would be exactly 5 feet and 4 inches from the ground. 

All that “knowing” I did, yet, as I watched the jogger slam into the wire and get clotheslined to his butt, the blood wasn’t coming out at nearly the speed I thought it would. 

In fact, the jogger just sat there, rubbing his neck and becoming absolutely flabbergasted as he drew his hand back from his throat and saw the watery, red blood coating his palm.

In a state of animalistic fear after noticing the wire, his eyes darted around wildly as he rose to his feet. 

Afraid of my target's escape, I quickly jumped from the bush where I hid, waiting to snap a picture of his corpse once the job was completed. 

His eyes lit up with fear as I knocked him down to his back, quickly analyzing the area to make sure no one was around. 

As the old man struggled, I unhooked the wire from one of the trees and wrapped it around his neck. 

I pulled as hard as I could and heard flesh tearing and veins ripping as the man's struggling grunts turned to gurgles, and the sound of running shoes seizing against concrete filled the air. 

Once his feet stopped kicking and his body went completely limp, I removed the wire from his neck. He was nearly decapitated as he lay there on the vacant trail. 

The sounds of nature continued. Birds sang to the backdrop of gently trickling water from a nearby stream as the man's blood leaked further and further down the concrete path.

As I said, my character had to take photos upon the job's completion, so that’s what he did.  

I snapped a few shots from various angles before rolling up the wire and hurrying back to my old Volkswagen, covered head to toe in blood.

Again, I AM NOT A MYSTERY WRITER. 

Like, I didn’t even begin to think about all the DNA evidence that’d be collected from the scene, the amount of witnesses that would’ve been around in such a public space, and don’t even get me started on the fact that he just, what? Left the old man there on the trail for people to find and report? Pick a lane right? 

That’s exactly what I thought too. 

And that’s exactly why I DELETED that story. Moved it to the trash bin immediately after reading it, utterly ashamed of myself, I must say. 

I 100 percent planned on just calling it a night, and picking up on a new story the next day; one that I felt confident in. 

As I lay in bed, drifting into sleep, it felt as though my eyes were closed for mere moments before the booming sound of knocks came thumping from my front door. Sunlight filled my room, and as I groggily made my way towards the door, the rhythmic knocking abruptly stopped. 

When I opened the door, there was no one there, not even in the hallway. 

However…there were some Polaroid photos placed carefully on my welcome mat.

They were of the old man, exactly how I’d imagined him and exactly how I’d mutilated him. All taken from the exact angles as from the story.

I couldn’t move for a brief moment as I stared down at them, disgusted at how they decorated the mat.

I quickly gathered my thoughts and scooped up each of the 6 photos. 

Lying them out on the coffee table, I sat on the couch with a “this can’t possibly be happening” look on my face, and my head fell into my hands as the realization hit me. 

Flipping on the TV, I turned to the news just in time to see the headline:

KEY WITNESS IN RICO CASE FOUND BRUTALLY MURDERED ON PARK TRAIL IN ATLANTA

“Welp,” I thought to myself. “It was fun while it lasted.” 

Look, I’m writing this now because I’m not sure when my next story will be. I can hear the tactical boots of a SWAT team rushing up the stairs in my building, and I’m sure I know exactly where they’re headed.

I have no more to say, other than thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed.",1,1767412051.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False
1q2k4c0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2k4c0,Managing task paralysis esp for ADHD,"**Planning stage:**

**1. Awareness and insight:** Being aware when you want to do the task but have difficulty to get started. Give yourself time to introspect (think internally that you are experiencing it, it's okay to experience what you're going through, remind yourself that you are going to get up in next 5 - 10 minutes and get started, and think of the feeling of happiness once the task would be done).   
  
Task paralysis often masks fear of judgment, perfectionism, or uncertainty about how to proceed. Name the real obstacle so you can address it.

  
**2. Too much on your plate with equal importance:** If you want to do too many things all at the same time, not much would get done. Use the Eisenhower matrix to categorize which tasks are important and which one can be put at a later time. People with ADHD can struggle to get tasks done that are important compared to tasks that are interesting. To help overcome this, follow step 3 below. 

  
**3. Know your rewards and how to incorporate these in task:** Knowing which things make you happy and interested and incorporating these in the task. Sometimes starting with a rewarding task can help us to get up which can break the stuck phase. Similarly, a change in environment can be helpful. Remember that rewards need to be 'in between' or in the 'background' of the task and not become a main focus or be in the foreground.

**4.** **Create a layout of the task:** First identify the expected final outcome e.g. ""I've to clean the dishes"". Now imagine/ visualize the overall structure, steps, outline of the tasks that need to be done. Remember to keep the list basic and short so it doesn't lead to task paralysis again. 

If there is a complex or difficult task, you can use [https://goblin.tools/](https://goblin.tools/) to break any task into do-able steps.

**Getting started:**  
  
**5. Getting ready to do it:** What makes you fresh? Is it a shower, going for a walk, coffee, music, playing with a pet etc. Start on a positive note, doing something unrelated sets the motion to then begin the task.

  
**6. Setting (realistic) time limits:**  Set realistic time limit to do the task while incorporating for mini short breaks, brief time adjustments for distractions and try to stick with those time limits. Ensure that you add buffer (some empty time slot) in between different tasks so if you couldn't finish 1 task on time, you have some extra time to make up for it, without impacting the other task. 

  
**7. Start small or with an interesting part of the task.** Try starting the task which might even involve looking at the task, putting together the items needed to start the task, or even doing the easiest, most interesting part of the task first. For example, if you've to make a presentation, just choose background colour or slide colour can help to get your mind ready to get into it.  

  
**8. Be on the lookout:** Be aware of any distractions, tiredness, mental fatigue, or need for perfection. 

**9.** **Save fine tuning for later.** Remind yourself of the layout / final outcome and use it to complete most of the task. The most important job is to create a structure, a skeleton on which you can add more things later. If you start focussing on perfection here, other parts of the task may get delayed.

**10. Remind, Reassure and Reward yourself:** Take multiple short breaks/ pauses, look at the progress you've made, and look at the expected outcome of the that you identified in step 4. Give yourself praise for getting started. If you're following checklist or task steps, it might be helpful to cross off the steps you've completed. Remember some progress is better than no progress.   
  
I take a break of 1 minute after every 5 minutes of studying. It doesn't involve me leaving the study place, just sitting there, but try to think of a happy positive and relaxing memory. 

  
**11. Know help is available:** You can always come back to a task later, ask someone you trust for help for overcoming any hurdle or difficulty with the task.

  
**12. Use body doubling.** Work alongside someone else (in person or virtually), even if they're doing something completely different. The presence of another person can activate your focus. Alternatively, tell someone you'll share your progress by a specific time, or schedule a meeting that requires the task's completion. 

**Task completion:**

**13. Do take time to relax, or a bigger break or reward:** Give yourself permission to rest, relax and take a bigger break to reward yourself for attempting to do the task. Remember every bit of step that you took brought you closer to success.

**14. Reflect:** What worked, what was helpful, what were the distractions and were you able to timely identify and resolve these? Task paralysis often worsens under time pressure.

We just bought a family cottage (yay!) and we have a few months before closing to develop our vision for what to do with the place once we take occupancy. I would love your first impressions, any inspired ideas or just any advice at all about creating a warm, cozy, woodsy, peaceful space in just the main living space area (living room and adjacent dining room with little sun room/nook - open floor plan). The house has a lower level and upper level as well but this floor will be the beating heart and it’s where we want to focus our efforts for now. I’ve attached photos with the current wall colour (peach - not good!), but all furnishings removed since this is what it will be when we move in. 

Seeking advice and thoughts on: 

1. Making the most of the elements we love (sun room/nook, fireplace, double high ceilings, southwest windows and woody river view) and downplaying what we don’t love (vague suburban/builder grade vibe to certain elements)

1. Baseline palette for walls/rugs/furnishings. Right now I have a warm greenish toned wall with muted red toned rugs in mind and earthy, eclectic but not matching couch, armchairs, coffee table etc. But looking for suggestions or ideas! 

Our style, such as it is: relaxed, earthy, warm, cozy, informal. We have two kids under 12. It is a cottage after all!

This was an enjoyable Chardonnay - very well made-  but definitely hedonistic and opulent in style. 

A powerful wine. 
In the glass, a rich gold color, hefty body and viscous.

The nose borders on pronounced with ripe and dried primary of citrus (lemon drop , tangerine) orchard fruit (candied yellow apple) stone (apricot) tropical of (pineapple, mango, banana), mineral of (wet stone) ; Followed by secondary (butterscotch, mild vanilla bean, coffee, lees) tertiary (beeswax, honey). 

The palate echoes this but with a rich waxy texture. Acidity is high but maybe just shy of holding up to the full ripe fruit. High alcohol gives it enough structure to carry it.  

The finish is long. Overall an outstanding wine with a huge personality. Gets a little overbearing after the second glass.

1q2jy10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q2jy10/aita_for_not_buying_a_homeless_person_food/,AITA for not buying a homeless person food?,"For context, I work in an inner city hospital. The entrances are open 24/7 so anyone can walk in. Homeless people often stay in the cafeteria when it gets really cold out during the winter, and most of the time they just stick to themselves and don’t really bother anyone. 

Anyway, I was in line at this place that sells overpriced food and drinks during my lunch break because it was the only place open during the weekend. I saw a homeless lady go up to a few people asking them if they can buy her some food. She got to me and asked for “just a coffee would be fine.” I said “no, sorry.” She goes to a few people who also said no. At this point, she’s crying to a couple of men sitting at a table telling them how people were so mean and she was asking nicely. One of them agrees to get her a coffee and a donut. At this point, I felt really guilty. One coffee wouldn’t have hurt. Once they got to the teller, she ordered a whole meal. I mean hamburger, large fries, large coffee, and a milkshake. The guy buying looked astounded, but still paid for her meal. She said thank you and he walked away. She sat at a table to eat, but when the men left, she went to other people asking for food AGAIN. 

AITA? Maybe if I said yes and ordered for her myself, she would’ve just gotten a coffee lol

I’m budgeting super strict this year and have been taking advantage of the associate menu a lot. Here are some ways I have mixed it up that might be different than the usual No Bun hoagie salad or whatever else. These should all be FSRA approved as well and your co-workers will not be breaking any rules or adding extra ingredients causing shrink. 
Please feel free to share your own as well. 

**Meatball and Garlic Bread**
4 meatballs in bowl with provolone on top. shorti roll with butter, oregano, parm and garlic aioli and toast it. Free shorti 

**Chicken and Dumplings**
Small chicken corn from the $1 menu and a buttered biscuit. Ask them to put the biscuit in a bowl and then pour the soup on top. > $3 

**Walking Taco**
Get a free chicken or beef steak shorti, hold the roll and have them put it in a bowl with the cheese cut up. Add lettuce, tomato, cucumber whatever you want. Buy a bag of doritos and add the bowl contents to the doritos. >$3 

**Chicken Quesadilla**
Get a 50c cheese quesadilla and 3 chicken strips for 50 cents. Ask them to add the strips to the quesadilla or add them yourself after. 

**Cinnamon Sugar Bagel**
Buttered bagel from deli and use cinnamon and sugar from the coffee island to top it. I usually ask for it in a clamshell and sprinkle a packet of sugar over it and a few shakes of cinnamon or I mix the cinnamon and sugar in a coffee cup and sprinkle over it. Optional add a banana. $1.03 with the Banana

White bread sandwiches are 50 cents, I take one or two home if I have off the next day for a $1 lunch. 

**Ice Cream Sundae for Two**
Two warmed cookies and ask for them each in a bowl. Get a parfait of your choice and put half in each bowl. Cookie Sundae!!! My boyfriend and I do this sometimes, I don’t do this at work but figured I would share. 

Also open to advice on the best ways to freeze/reheat sizzlis. If I’m eating it the next day I’m just going to get the cheese on the side the refrigerate it and microwave it the next morning and add the cheese.

1q2jnke,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessPH/comments/1q2jnke/need_helpideas_with_the_current_market_in_our_city/,Need Help/Ideas with the current market in our city,"I've been operating a Indian Restaurant that'll be 4 years old now in January 5 (yay) but we've been having an issue with the current market here in Cagayan de Oro (siguro hindi talaga sya issue but more like an observation lang). I've found myself educating the people more about what the food is and why its different from other cuisines. Yung most na kasanayan ng mga tao kasi is Middle eastern lang and it's been a struggle with showing them the difference of flavors considering din they are not as adventurous to other cuisines as they'd believe it would be too spicy or it would be too much for their palatte to handle. And mind you, as an Indian who grew up in the country and as a chef who worked abroad (nyc) for 5 years I've already adjusted the recipe to cater to the palette of the Filipinos all the while retaining the traditional process of cooking and usage of the spices all the while bringing with me the knowledge and understanding of customer behavior and palette acceptance from that country. (am i making sense?)

I've done the marketing, we've joined multiple food fest events (we even won the first one and got featured in ABS CBN and [Spot.ph](http://Spot.ph) for 3 years in a row now) and have customers from different cities in the Ph come over and try us out and even ask if they can fly their food back to Manila. but it seems na we are either losing the interest of the local market or there might be something wrong with the marketing. 

Lately we have focused our marketing on using the story telling approach to also educate the people that there really are different variations and techniques in cooking biryanis and Indian cuisine in general and so far, okay naman ang engagements sa social media and conversion sa customers. We have been planning to collaborate with other local vloggers in the area but as much as possible gusto ko sana as organic ang growth sa brand.   
  
The people do enjoy the food and we have been consistent with our flavors naman but the behavior we see the most from our customers or the market are either surprised or they haven't really known na we are here like they just found out about us. And once they do try us out, bumabalik naman din sila. Surprisingly our holiday trays really popped off and got us to our highest number of trays sold so far since we started last december. 

Sales wise, we've also noticed that our sales was mostly from grabfood or delivery based orders instead of walkin and so far okay naman din ang design and actual vibe sa store. We play Indian music, we light up some incense and we have murals in our walls. so its fairly bright and homey naman. The only downside sa new location namin is we only have parking for one vehicle but we are situated in one of the most accessible places in the city and noticed people just walk to us or find their own parking. Like we are so close to everything. Schools, malls, government offices etc. and (like all businesses) we are wanting to have more people to dine in Instead of getting them to order via grabfood because in reality, Grab really does take a HUGE cut in sales. we're talking more than 30-50% at most. 

Just for more context, the food scene in the city mostly comprises of the usual coffee shops, restaurants and the samgyup places with prices ranging from 150-250 some go as far as 400 pesos for a decent meal. We have ours from 150 for a plate of biryani to 450 na rin. Our spices and rice all imported from India and got to these prices as i found an awesome supplier that can send me the goods at distributor price and our serving time typically ranges from 5-10 minutes as I've constructed a process that would serve the food quickly whilst retaining the highest quality possible to hungry people. 

But siguro the biggest thing i've noticed talaga that is affecting our sales and our branding is the social media posts in facebook when other influencers or just people in general sharing those Indian streetfood videos being handled in a very unhygienic way. Even I get disgusted with seeing that but it really hurts the business when we get generalized as well na madumi din kami. Those videos you see are mostly part of the poorest places in India. 

So, the question that has been really revolving in my mind is   
how do we get out of the stigma or generalization or whatever you call it and really just show people that we are here to share our culture. 

Just for a bit more context and backstory, i grew up In cdo moving through different schools because i was bullied for being different and because of the 5-6 thing. Like grabe, even in gradeschool id have my teachers come up to me to ask the number of my parents because they wanted to borrow money was just a bit degrading lang and that even went to college where id have my profs do the same thing.I started the brand while i was in college in 2016, my friends and other peers kept pushing me to sell the food after they kept requesting it for parties or for school orgs gatherings and events and we did our first popup ever sa foundation days ng uni namin and it was a hit ever since, we've had long lines and it was just me myself and i doing the cooking, delivering and setup. fast forward to today, we're still famous when it comes to events pero pag dating na sa dine in medyo matumal na.

 I love filipino food and love this country and cant get enough of it but I love it even more when people are actually curious about our food because I want to change the way how the people see us through our food (its actually also part of our mission and vision sa restaurant) but year after year it seems like an uphill battle with new customers (which is fine kasi thats always part of it but ive realized its draining me a bit kasi no matter how much we explain parang hindi parin makuha)

# TL;DR (for Reddit)

* 4-year-old Indian restaurant in Cagayan de Oro struggling more with **local dine-in traffic** than food quality or pricing
* Food is adjusted for Filipino palate; people who try it **like it and come back**
* Biggest challenges:
   * Low awareness despite years in operation
   * Fear of Indian food being *too spicy / unfamiliar*
   * Negative stigma from viral unhygienic Indian street food videos
   * Heavy reliance on GrabFood (30–50% cut hurts margins)
* Events, pop-ups, and holiday trays perform very well → shows demand exists
* Social media engagement is decent, but **conversion to walk-ins is weak**
* Location is accessible but has **limited parking**
* Market is dominated by affordable, familiar concepts (coffee, samgyup, casual meals)
* Goal isn’t just sales, but **changing perceptions** of Indian cuisine and culture
* Owner feels burned out from constantly needing to explain and educate the market
* Main question: **How do you break stigma and get locals to see Indian food as approachable, clean, and craveable—not intimidating?**

but yeah, I think ive given most information needed but do let me know below if there are other things you'd like to know or i have forgotten to add. also note that i am not here to brag or what not but really genuinely curious about your input and genuinely seeking help.

We can all come together with individual articles or pieces we wanna share or chat about as a group, or we could all collectively choose some book or topic to explore. Maybe it could be in a coffee shop somewhere like once every 2-3 weeks or something. no commitment, no membership, just come as you are.

i think there’s a couple other similar left political reading groups in the area, and i guess my critique is only for those who know this nuance and topic, but they very much make up the authoritarian left (compared to anarchists/anarchist adjacency which is the libertarian left). i’m not really interested in organizing around marxist-leninist literature in Cuba or China or the Soviet Union or random “communist” stuff like that. there is a large history of anarchist and adjacent literature that my intention is to not chase after Marx or Lenin or anything like that. Especially when there’s extensive Black and Brown anarchist histories

I’m a POC anarchist myself and i’m currently researching anarchist literature in grad school too. i’ve been going to punk shows in san bernardino for a little bit and there’s anarchists there too. food not bombs and the folks over at Barrio Fuerza are very cool. they even organized an inland empire anarchist bookfair a while ago. i guess i’m just trying to gauge if anyone would be interested because i have a very large collection of anarchist literature and i want to spread my passion and collection with folks who wanna learn more, and on top that, i want to be around more like minded folks i want to learn from. and i’d love to collaborate with local food not bombs folks too. let me know thanks or just PM me directly",9,1767410693.0,InlandEmpire,3,0.76,False

1q2jkfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q2jkfz/grandma_was_worse/,Grandma was worse,"I never thought I would come back to Grandma’s house. Not after she died, not after the nightmares started. But here I am, sifting through dusty furniture and faded photographs, trying to make sense of the life she left behind. The air smells like mothballs and old carpet, the kind of smell that sticks to your lungs and refuses to leave.


As I move through the living room, a memory hits me, sharp and unwelcome. I am six years old again, small and terrified, my grandmother’s sharp voice echoing as she shoves me into the closet. She said it was for my own good, that I needed to learn patience or manners or something. But I knew better.


Inside that closet, I would sit with the doll. The one she kept propped in the corner. Life size, porcelain face, eyes too wide, too real. I swore it would move when I blinked, a hand shifting slightly, a head tilting just enough to catch me watching. I told myself it was just my imagination. But my six year old self knew.


I laugh nervously to myself and walk down the narrow hallway toward the old guest bedroom. The closet is still there. The door looks the same, scuffed at the bottom, the little brass knob tarnished with age. My heart starts beating faster.


I reach for the handle.


Inside, it is dark. The shape is unmistakable. The doll. My stomach drops. It is standing there, just like I remember, staring at me with that impossible, patient smile.
I take a step forward. My hand brushes the doorframe. The closet door swings shut behind me.


I try to pull it open. It will not budge.


The darkness presses in, thicker than the air outside. My breath comes in shallow, ragged gasps. Then I hear it, a faint creak, like the doll is shifting, turning its head.
I am trapped. And suddenly, I realize I never left the closet in the first place.


My fingernails scrape against the old wood as I yank at the knob. For a sick second I am sure it is not going to open, that I am going to die in this closet with the thing I have feared since I was a kid. Then, with a groan, the door finally gives way and I stumble backward into the bedroom.


The doll falls forward, its porcelain limbs clattering against the floorboards.


It is not smiling anymore.


The once patient face is twisted, jaw open just enough to show faintly carved teeth, its painted eyes narrowed into an expression I can only describe as rage. The lips, cracked with age, look like they are about to split open and scream.


I do not wait to find out. I bolt.


I am halfway down the hall before I realize I am running toward the kitchen. The smell of old spice racks and stale coffee hits me, a smell baked so deeply into the walls it feels permanent. My heart is hammering so hard it feels like the house can hear it.


And then I see it.


On the counter, between a stack of yellowed newspapers and an unplugged toaster, sits a toy I have not seen in thirty years. A thick, hollow plastic Pillsbury Doughboy. Its tiny hands frozen in a mock wave, that stupid little chef’s hat perched on its head.


My knees go weak. Suddenly I am seven again.


I can hear it, even now, the soft pitter patter of plastic feet running across the linoleum at night. The giggle. That high pitched hoo hoo echoing from the dark kitchen while everyone else slept. I used to tell my grandma about it. I would stand there shaking, pointing at it while it laughed and ran in circles around her legs.


She would slap me for lying.


Not because she was cruel, but because she could not see it. To her, the Doughboy was always exactly where she left it, silent and harmless on the counter. She thought I was inventing monsters where there were none.


But I remember the look on her face sometimes, just before she hit me. Confused. Almost afraid. Like she knew something was wrong, she just did not know what.
A sound breaks me out of the memory. A thud from outside. Heavy, like something hitting the wall just under the kitchen window.


I spin, yanking the curtain aside. Nothing. Just the dead yard and the skeletal remains of her rose bushes.


When I turn back, the Doughboy’s head is gone.


It is sitting next to the toy’s body on the counter, separated cleanly as if someone had popped it off like a bottle cap.


And the tiny, hollow body is still standing perfectly upright.


I need to get out of the kitchen. Out of the house. But something inside me says do not run. Maybe it is pride. Maybe it is habit. Maybe it is Grandma’s voice, the one I still sometimes hear in my sleep, telling me fear only feeds things.


I force myself back into the living room, trying to ignore the noise of my own heartbeat. The smell of dust and mothballs clings to everything. I grab a cardboard box from the pile near the sofa and start tossing her knick knacks into it just to keep my hands busy. China teacups. A cracked snow globe. A dozen little figurines she kept on a shelf I was never allowed to touch.


Normal things. Safe things. I cling to the motion like it is a ritual.


As I wrap each piece in yellowed newspaper, another memory bubbles up. Grandma sitting in her chair late at night, chain smoking with the lights off except for the glow of the TV. The smell of coffee always nearby, dark and bitter, even at hours no one should be awake.
She would tell me things back then. Half lullabies, half warnings.


I know how to tie my spirit to an object, she said once, her voice low and rasping. When I pass, I can stay in this realm. Watch over you. Protect you from the ugly things that crawl in when no one is looking.


I thought she was just scaring me, or trying to make herself sound important. She even showed me once. She pressed a hand against one of her little trinkets, a porcelain cat, a silver thimble, and whispered something under her breath. Words that made the air feel tight and wrong.


She said the items were her eyes. Her hands.
Now, packing up these same knick knacks, I notice something. The items are warm. Not warm from the house. Warm like skin.


I drop one into the box and it rattles against the others. I swear I hear something shift in the next room, like a chair being dragged slowly across the floor. Something pacing.
Grandma always said the world was full of things that liked children because they were easy to fool. She said closets were doors and toys were invitations.


She said she would never leave me alone.


She said she would be here when the world turned ugly.


And all at once it hits me. Maybe she was not lying. Maybe she was keeping things busy.


I freeze as I hear it, the soft gurgle of a percolator bubbling in the kitchen. The smell hits me first, thick and dark, almost black, curling through the stale air like it never left.


I step toward the sound, every muscle in my body screaming not to, and push open the kitchen door.


The sight nearly stops my heart.


The doll is sitting in one of the kitchen chairs, its face still twisted with anger, jaw set, eyes burning like coals. The Pillsbury Doughboy sits on the table, headless, its hollow little body rigid, vibrating slightly, like it wants to move but knows better.


And there she is.


My grandmother stands at the counter, cigarette burning down between her fingers, pouring coffee into two mugs like this is any other night. She looks solid, familiar, real. Only her shadow gives her away.


At first it mimics her movements. Then it doesn’t. It stretches too long, bends the wrong way, coils against the baseboards like something alive, something watching the doorways instead of me.


Stop pissing your pants, James, she says, voice low and amused. Come have some coffee.


The doll lets out a sound, a thin, furious whine. The Doughboy rattles once and goes still.


Grandma does not even look at them. But the shadow shifts, spreading wider, blocking the hallway, the closets, every dark opening in the house.


The smell of coffee is intoxicating. Warm. Familiar. Safe in a way nothing else here is. My heart is still pounding, but against all reason, against all fear, something in me steps forward.


Her eyes meet mine. They are the same eyes I remember, sharp and tired and loving in a way that always hurt. But now there is something else there. Something patient. Something that has been standing guard for a very long time.


I realize then the toys were never hers.


They were bait.


And she never left because she could not afford to.
She takes a drag from her cigarette and exhales slowly, the smoke drifting like a warning.


You’re too old now, she says softly. They’re starting to notice you again.


She slides a mug across the table toward me.


Sit. Drink. I’ve been holding them back as long as I can.


And for the first time, I understand.

1q2jk7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfitecGo/comments/1q2jk7i/dark_roast_sourness/,"Dark Roast ""sourness""","I've had my Go for only a few months and in the beginning was super impressed with how consistently I was able to get good shots.  Now I can consistently get bad ones :(

I have a Eureka Oro Mignon Single Dose grinder so grind each shot just prior to loading the basket.  Since a new bag of beans a few weeks back, all my dark roast shots have a sourness to them that seems different to the usual under extraction.  Sometimes I get lucky and add some burnt to the sourness.  
  
I had some medium dark beans and can get a good shot from them and my decaf seems fine too.  I've had 2 different roast dates in the ""dodgy"" bags and have used them when they're at least 12 days old.

I'm using the stock portafilter and stock basket (and have tried an aftermarket straightwalled basket too).  I've tried changing dose from 17.5 and 18g in the stock basket and up to 20g in the other one.  I've tried changing the temperature lower to 87C and 91C from the usual 93C.  I've changed the grind to coarser and finer.  I've even tried preinfusion for 2 seconds. Each change was made one at a time .. I've gone through SO many beans.

I would have thought at least one of the combinations would be ok .. WHY IS IT SO HARD lol.  Using the same settings as the last good shot doesn't work and adjusting a bit either way (finer/coarser) doesn't hit the spot - which is what I ""usually"" do to adjust for new beans.

So what can I do to make this dark roast taste better?  Is it because it takes 8-10seconds for first drops?  If I grind coarser or lower the dose to get first drops earlier the whole shot is then sped up.

Give me your tried and true tips please.

(I'm in Brisbane Australia so ambient temperature can be 27-35C and it can be raining or not at the moment and is most often humid to some degree which means I often have to do micro adjustments day to day anyway.  Beans are Coffee Supreme Boxer with roast date of 15/12/2025. )",1,1767410494.0,ProfitecGo,1,1.0,False

I know how to tie my spirit to an object, she said once, her voice low and rasping. When I pass, I can stay in this realm. Watch over you. Protect you from the ugly things that crawl in when no one is looking.


I thought she was just scaring me, or trying to make herself sound important. She even showed me once. She pressed a hand against one of her little trinkets, a porcelain cat, a silver thimble, and whispered something under her breath. Words that made the air feel tight and wrong.


She said the items were her eyes. Her hands.
Now, packing up these same knick knacks, I notice something. The items are warm. Not warm from the house. Warm like skin.


I drop one into the box and it rattles against the others. I swear I hear something shift in the next room, like a chair being dragged slowly across the floor. Something pacing.
Grandma always said the world was full of things that liked children because they were easy to fool. She said closets were doors and toys were invitations.


She said she would never leave me alone.


She said she would be here when the world turned ugly.


And all at once it hits me. Maybe she was not lying. Maybe she was keeping things busy.


I freeze as I hear it, the soft gurgle of a percolator bubbling in the kitchen. The smell hits me first, thick and dark, almost black, curling through the stale air like it never left.


I step toward the sound, every muscle in my body screaming not to, and push open the kitchen door.


The sight nearly stops my heart.


The doll is sitting in one of the kitchen chairs, its face still twisted with anger, jaw set, eyes burning like coals. The Pillsbury Doughboy sits on the table, headless, its hollow little body rigid, vibrating slightly, like it wants to move but knows better.


And there she is.


My grandmother stands at the counter, cigarette burning down between her fingers, pouring coffee into two mugs like this is any other night. She looks solid, familiar, real. Only her shadow gives her away.


At first it mimics her movements. Then it doesn’t. It stretches too long, bends the wrong way, coils against the baseboards like something alive, something watching the doorways instead of me.


Stop pissing your pants, James, she says, voice low and amused. Come have some coffee.


The doll lets out a sound, a thin, furious whine. The Doughboy rattles once and goes still.


Grandma does not even look at them. But the shadow shifts, spreading wider, blocking the hallway, the closets, every dark opening in the house.


The smell of coffee is intoxicating. Warm. Familiar. Safe in a way nothing else here is. My heart is still pounding, but against all reason, against all fear, something in me steps forward.


Her eyes meet mine. They are the same eyes I remember, sharp and tired and loving in a way that always hurt. But now there is something else there. Something patient. Something that has been standing guard for a very long time.


I realize then the toys were never hers.


They were bait.


And she never left because she could not afford to.
She takes a drag from her cigarette and exhales slowly, the smoke drifting like a warning.


You’re too old now, she says softly. They’re starting to notice you again.


She slides a mug across the table toward me.


Sit. Drink. I’ve been holding them back as long as I can.


And for the first time, I understand.


She didn’t protect me from the monsters by being kind.


She protected me by being worse.",2,1767410373.0,urbanfantasy,0,1.0,False
1q2jhvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q2jhvr/i_hate_my_little_brother_so_much_and_like_nobody/,I hate my little brother so much and like nobody around me gets why,"He does nothing all day he lays on the couch downstairs or sits at his computer ALL DAY every single day right now I have noise cancelling headphones on and I've had them on all day and my head hurts so bad because of them but he refuses to turn down the volume of the YouTube video he's watching or wear headphones and it's on almost full volume we have like an average sized two story house and I'm on the opposite side of the house on the second story while he's on the first and I can still hear it. Me and my mom clean the entire house every day and he still manages to make it look like it hasn't been cleaned in a month every night. The coffee table and dining table are covered in chip bags and trash, the sink isn't completely full of dishes, but that's only because he just leaves them on the counter. My birthday was a couple days ago and I only had a small slice of my cake, my older brother and mom each had one slice and my mom's boyfriend didn't have any, there was more than half left. When I woke up I saw that it was gone and the empty container was put back in the fridge, I asked my little brother about it and he denied eating it but he's the only one who was downstairs that night since he spends all night watching YouTube and eating snacks. Another thing is he won't stop leaving clothes on the bathroom floor (literally covering half the bathroom) and won't do his laundry, throwing his trash on the bathroom floor instead of the trashcan that's conveniently right between the toilet and sink, and leaving the toilet clogged with toilet paper. I've cleaned the entire bathroom so many times and it's disgusting because he just wears his clothes for so long they just smell like sweat. He'll leave the house every once in a while and that's when I'm finally able to clean and have the house smell nice, open the windows, and cook a nice meal without my food being stolen from me. And without having to hear whatever he's watching playing on full volume on the tv. I tried to go downstairs and make some food because I haven't eaten much besides a few light snacks the last few days because I was sick and if I ate anything more it just made me feel worse, he immediately started saying me opening the fridge and stuff was too loud as if he wasn't yelling at me and (still) watching YouTube loud on the TV. I just ended up going back to my room because I don't want to deal with this today especially when I'm getting over being sick. He also never goes into his room, he trashed it and made my aunt clean it when she visited for some reason and uses the living room like it's his bedroom and my entire family is so sick of it my mom tells him every night to go sleep in his room but after she goes to sleep he just goes back downstairs and some people in the house actually want to get up early like me and my mom's boyfriend. He wakes up around 4:30 and I wake up around 4:30-5:00 and I like to make breakfast around 5:30-6:00 after I get ready and it wouldn't be a problem if he didn't yell at me for ""being too loud making breakfast"" and waking him up and he gets more mad when I tell him he could just go to his room and go sleep there instead but he doesn't want to and gets mad at me for not waiting until 8:00 (when we have to leave in just a couple minutes) to get ready. I like to have time to do things in the morning like write or read or crochet or draw after I get ready, also to study in the morning because I actually care about my grades. Meanwhile he just rolls off the couch and puts his shoes on and eats a bowl of cereal and leaves wearing the same clothes he's had on all week. We go to the same school right now but I'm thinking of asking to transfer to a different school where I'll leave earlier and get home earlier (also because it's a more art based school and I've already dedicated most my life to  art wether it's ballet or acting or painting or sculptures or sewing and the school is pretty good for that, also it's a way nicer and prettier building.) so I'll finally get to spend time on my own while being downstairs because my mom and her boyfriend don't get home till later. Meaning I'll be able to actually cook food uninterrupted and maybe crochet on the couch while watching a movie or something because there won't be anyone playing videogames.",1,1767410324.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1q2jgzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q2jgzm/6_months_later_since_my_5_year_relationship/,6 months later since my 5 year relationship.,"Hey everyone. I’m 22 and not exactly sure what I’m looking for here, just wanted to put this out there. My ex and I broke up about six months ago after a five-year relationship. It ended pretty badly — she cheated and had already emotionally checked out before I even realized what was happening. We went no contact immediately and I’ve blocked her everywhere.

I don’t miss her.. we were toxic but she still pops into my head sometimes. Day to day I’m fine, but lately I’m really feeling that “void” people talk about. I’ve been in a relationship since I was 16, so this is the first time I’ve truly been on my own.

I’ve noticed I’m starting to chase the idea of another woman just to fill that space, even though I know that’s not the right move. My social circle feels pretty dead too… most of my friends have girlfriends now and I can’t really relate to them anymore. I’ve never felt this alone before.

It’s Friday night and I want to go do something, but I don’t even have anyone to text. I’ve thought about reaching out to random people I used to barely talk to, but it feels weird and almost embarrassing. I tried online dating, but I don’t have any good photos without my ex in them and I don’t want to force it.

Everyone says to focus on self-development and work, and I do, that’s basically all I do now but I’m starting to lose motivation. I don’t want to watch movies or play games. I genuinely just crave connection. Something as simple as taking a woman out for coffee and talking sounds more appealing than anything else right now.",1,1767410257.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

4:30 PM

When I took the dispatcher position back in my hometown, I didn’t think I would have to deal with the kinds of things I’ve had to deal with today. It is now 4:30 PM Christmas Day as I write this. I’m hoping that I can get this posted before the end of the day so I can warn as many people as possible. You don’t want to be caught unaware of what’s going on right now. 

I am assuming that this is going on everywhere, but I don’t know that for sure right now. Although I am certain that you will agree with my assumption once you have read to the end of this post. Also, please forgive me if I ramble. I am very frantically typing this at the moment, and I may occasionally tangent to relieve stress. I don’t really have time to edit this, and it is a necessary coping mechanism, so deal with it. Please.

For context, I live in a small midwestern town, corn, soy, and grain country. I had just finished college and was experiencing some heavy burnout. I took the job back home, I think, because I needed some newfound sense of direction. Up until that point, I had been following a path laid out for me, not that I hadn’t made my own decisions, but I was making those choices with the eye of others in mind. I didn’t care about that anymore. Local dispatch for my hometown was the first opportunity where I thought I would be helpful, as in helping people, not somebody’s profit margin.

The only problem is I hate cops. I don’t know for certain what the origin of calling them pigs is, but I like to think it has to do with them basically being the state’s clean-up crew. In the sense that pigs served as the mob’s clean-up crew. I ended up taking the job because I knew a few of the cops from when I was a kid, and the sergeant in charge helped me out one time. I thought I could do some good with these personal connections. But now, I don’t know what any single person can do about anything anymore.

My family wasn’t around, so I decided to work Christmas Day at the station. Earlier in the month, it had snowed a ton, but now there was nothing but a thick layer of mist that made everything it touched wet. I hate 100% humidity. It makes my whole body sticky and uncomfortable. Regardless, I was inside quickly enough that it didn’t bother me too much. The sergeant, I’ll call him Bill, and his deputy, Greg, were the only two cops on call that day.

“Well, hey there, Nate, I hope you slept well?” Bill spoke with a deep baritone from under a bristly white mustache. 

“Yeah,” I said, evading the question. I began setting up my desk the way I liked it. I had my police mojo computer on my right and my own personal laptop on my left, which I was planning to watch Queen’s Gambit on.

“Good to hear it. Well, I’ll let you get to it. Me and Greg are gonna go get some coffee. So give us a call if anything explodes.” 

I smiled at him. “Will do.” He gave me a nod and walked away. I felt the rumble of their cruiser as it started. 

During this time, I was the only dispatcher on duty for my area, which was large, but didn’t even have one person per square mile on average. So, I was the lonely watchmen. A skeleton crew was normal, as this day was usually pretty uneventful out here, but I was worried about the fog and car accidents. I decided to raid the break room for snacks. On my way back, I passed by the front door for what would’ve been the second time. I was some distance from it down the hall, but as it perceived me, I felt a shiver run through my whole body. A huge deer, shrouded in fog from the bottom of the neck down, was staring through the clear glass of the front door. Staring at me as I held my bags of chips, cookies, and shit. It didn’t move, but its empty black eyes followed me as I receded towards my little office. I threw everything on my desk, then peeked back down the hall. It was gone.

“What the fuck,” I spat it out as if just then realising what happened. It didn’t look alive, closer to a taxidermied trophy.  

Any thinking I could’ve done was interrupted by a 911 call. I quickly sat at my desk, took a deep breath, and picked it up. “911, what’s your emergency?”

“It’s Earl!” I recognized the voice on the other end.

“Margaret? It’s Nate. Is Earl having another heart attack?” As I spoke, I entered her address and held the mouse over the button that would dispatch an ambulance. 

“Oh, Nate! Yes, he’s… he’s.  OH MY GOD!” I dispatched the ambulance, emphasizing emergency.

“Margaret? Are you okay?”

“He’s dead, he’s dead.”

“It’s okay, Mrs. Adler. The ambulance is already on its way, they’re gonna help him.”

“No, I…I felt his pulse go.” She started crying. 

I radioed Bill, muting the call. “Bill, I just sent an ambulance to the Adler residence. It’s not looking good, so you might want to head over.”

“Roger that.”

I heard Margaret wheezing and moving quickly, then the slam of a door, followed by more crying. “I can’t believe he’s dead. Oh my god, he’s dead.”

“Margaret, Bill’s gonna be there soon, okay?”

“Okay,” she said. Then an almost thunderous knocking.

“Margaret? Is everything okay?” 

I looked over at the GPS map. Bill was eight minutes away. The ambulance was four minutes away. Margaret gave nothing in reply other than a short intake of breath. I heard a doorknob twist and creak. Then a frantic movement and a click. She locked it.

“Margaret, was anyone else in the house with you?”

“No,” she whispered. “I had my finger on his pulse the whole time. That is not my husband.”

“Margaret? Why’d you lock me out?” It sounded like him. I have since googled Lazarus Sydrome but at the time, I assumed this was impossible, which it might as well have been. Regardless, the real thing that scared me was that Margaret didn’t trust it. In this situation, she should be in denial of his death, not of his life. 

“Don’t open the door,” I said. “The ambulance is three minutes away.”

“Margaret! Please! I’ve been to the other side, I can tell you! I can tell! I can tell! I can tell you! Margaret!” I heard a loud bang against the door. “That’s okay. You’ll find out soon enough anyways.” I heard muffled receding footsteps. Time passed in silence. I heard a more distant knock after the paramedics arrived. Then she hung up. I sat there for a moment. I don’t know how long. Another call came in. I answered.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Um… my-my name is Eddy.” The voice sounded like a young boy’s

“Okay, Eddy, what’s going on?”

“Um…a car hit us. Really hard.”

“Do you know where you are?”

“No, it hit on my mom’s side. She’s not moving.” I heard him start to cry.

“Is the driver of the other car still there?”

“He flew.”

“What do you mean?”

“He wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. He hit our car too.” 

I almost said “fuck me” out loud. This was not at all the stress level I was anticipating for the day.

“Who’s on the phone!?” I heard a man’s voice yell.

“Is that him?” He sounded fine. Then I remembered the last call.

“Yeah.”

“Eddy?” I heard a much sweeter voice.

“You stupid fucking bitch!” I heard screaming.

“Eddy, run down the street until you find a street sign okay?” I heard no response. “Eddy?” somebody hung up. “FUCK!!” I yelled. I was beginning to panic. I felt my chest tighten, and I began to cry as I spiraled down thoughts of uselessness. “What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?” I repeated to myself over and over again. Then I wrote this. I’ll let you know if anything else happens out here.

Thank you for reading 

Even though there’s nothing you can do

7 PM

Bill and Greg returned to the station sometime after that and found me in my office with my head in my arms.

“You okay there, Nate?” I looked up into his eyes. He looked tired. 

“Yeah, what happened to Margaret?” He sighed and thought for a moment. Instead of responding, he waved his arm and walked away. I rolled myself and my chair into the hall. “What do we do now?” I asked. The phone rang, and I went back into the office. Bill started walking back towards me. I picked up.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“I’m at Skeeter’s Pub, and there’s a guy with a gun.”

“Okay, is he threatening people with it?”

“Not yet, but him and this guy keep getting at it with each other. They’ve been here since before I got here, so I think they’re both drunk.”

“Alright, a coupleof  officers are on the way.” 

I muted myself as she said, “Thank you.”

“Armed drunkard at Skeeter’s pub” I looked at Bill. I’d never seen him scared like that before.

“Goddamnit, Greg, let’s go. Stay on the phone and keep us updated, Nate!” They left. 

“Ma’am can you get yourself out of the pub?”

“Not without moving past them, I’d rather just stay here.”

“Fuck you!” I heard from a distance. Then a loud pop followed by lots of screaming.

“Oh my god, he shot him,” she was whispering now. “No wait, did he miss?”

“No way,” I heard another voice. “I saw it go straight through his head.”

“What the fuck? He’s getting back up.”

“The man who was shot?” I asked.

“Yeah, he got shot in the head and just got back up. The other guys doesn’t know what to do.” I heard several more gunshots. 

“AHHHH!” A scream followed by a repetitive banging.

“Holy shit, he’s just smashing his face on the bar.”

“FREEZE!” I heard Bill yell. Something wet slid and then dropped onto the floor.

“I think the other guy is dead.” A wet gurgle and a fit of coughing followed. “Uh…I uh…”

“What’s happening?”

“He… got back up. What the fuck!? He got back up like it was nothing!?”

Pandemonium and several more gunshots followed before I lost connection. 

Am I anything but an observer?

Do I have the power to change things?

My shift ends soon

I guess I’ll go home

11AM

Hello everyone, I'm still hunkered down at home. I went back to the station to check on Bill and the guys and they gave me a copy of the police report. They're technically not supposed to do that, but who gives a fuck at this point?

Regardless, here is the report. I changed names, phone numbers, and such, but most of it was left as is. Just so you know, this report is wack. Read at your own discretion. 

[https://imgur.com/a/o2zSEmE](https://imgur.com/a/o2zSEmE)

I might go see Msg. McIntyre. I haven't been to church in a long time, and I'm starting to think this is some apocalypse shit. The more I think about what's happening with just this information, the more I scare myself with the potential implications. Even if the event is localised.

But that's not what has me scared at this very moment.

I had a dream last night. I'll try to remember it as best I can, which, as I’m writing this, turns out to be surprisingly easy.

I woke up and used the bathroom. I was already dreaming at this point, but I didn't know that. When I finished in the bathroom, the warm sun was out. It made me want to have a productive day, so I went to the kitchen and prepared myself a high-protein breakfast.

""Sleep well, honey?"" she asked.

""Yeah, pretty good.""

""What's the plan for the day?"" he asked.

""Hopefully something productive."" I turned around to serve a plate of sausage and eggs, but all I saw was two taxidermied deer sitting at the dinner table. Their legs and arms were malformed so that they sat like humans. I served both of them plates anyway. They didn't eat.

""You okay there, bud?"" he asked. Mouth unmoving.

""Yeah, I just."" My eyes began to sting, and tears formed. ""I just... don't know what's happening."" I put my head in my hands.

""Ohh, that's okay, honey."" I didn't hear her move, but I felt warmer, like she was close to me. ""No one does.""

“It’s too much mom. It’s all too much.”

“I know, honey. It’s okay. Everything will be okay.”

I looked up to see an empty dinner table, except for one occupant at the head to my right. I knew who it was immediately. His head bloomed like a flower, and he took forceful, wet breaths through broken airways. Sputtering blood with each motion, he shook as if in a great deal of pain.

""Ray?""

I woke up. My bed was drenched in sweat. I've been trying to stay calm the whole day. I really miss them. I was breaking down, basically rolling around the floor like I was on fire, until Bear lay on top of me. I'm going to the morning service tomorrow. At the very least, I'll meet people who might know more than me. The fog still blankets everything I can see, maybe a foot away from all the windows. I keep imagining the dark shapes of deer at the border.

8AM

With the wall of white mist still obscuring most of my vision, I drove down the corn-flanked country road. Since I knew the town well, it didn’t take me long to find the church. The parking lot was empty, and the building itself stood as a giant shadow in the fog. I grabbed the go bag I packed and leashed up Bear. 

As we approached the front door, Bear turned around, started panting, and whimpered. I placed my hand on the doorknocker before turning around to see what was behind me. There was nothing but fog. Then I blinked. 

In a perfect semicircle at the edge of the fog were a ton of taxidermied deer, all facing the church door, or me. I began knocking somewhat frantically. McIntyre opened the door and quickly pulled me in as Bear pushed from behind. She then closed and locked the door.

“Nate, my son. I am glad to see you are okay.”

“Same to you.” We hugged each other, which was something we had never done before, but she was always good at figuring out what people needed, and a hug was pretty high on my list. I relaxed a bit after that.

“We have another lost soul seeking refuge.” She pointed to a young girl, maybe eleven or twelve, who was sitting in one of the pews. “She hasn’t spoken since arriving, but she is alone as far as I can tell.” It was at this point that I realized my position in this situation. I’m still getting used to being an adult. My response to this realization was to “man up.” I constantly rotated around the various windows of the church. Even though I couldn’t see shit, I figured this was the best way to make sure no one snuck in. Also, this way I could let someone in if needed, and they wouldn’t have to go through the trouble of knocking. I don’t know, it made sense to me at the time.

10AM

At some point, we heard a distant-sounding scream. It came from behind the church.

“What’s back there?” I asked McIntyre.

“Just the cemetery.” We looked at eachother and acknowledged the fear in both of us. She muttered a silent prayer.

I quietly whispered, “fuck me.” I told Bear to stay near the child. The screaming grew closer until there was a loud thud on the back door, which was out of sight to us in the nave. The thud was followed by wailing and repeated banging.

“Help!” we heard muffled. This stirred both McIntyre and me, and we went down into the sacristy together. We were under the altar then, so there was no light. McIntyre turned on a flashlight, revealing the shuddering door. She didn’t hesitate. She opened it.

“Praise god!” the woman yelled as she almost fell inside. Dull grey light washed over the sacristy. 

I immediately noticed something was very wrong. She was wearing an old, tattered dress that was filthy, along with a bonnet on top of her head, which was in slightly better condition. 

A bonnet?

Even out here, people don’t really wear those anymore. 

I didn’t pursue that thought further as she suddenly barfed up what I can only describe as grave leavings. There were worms, chunks of dirt, and even mushrooms that were attached to the dirt chunks.  Then I saw her hands. I blinked several times in disbelief as I realised the meat of them was gone. There was a point in which the skin just stopped, a red border of coagulated, undulating blood preceded naked bone. Shreds of skin still patched her hands. Scraps clinging. McIntyre’s eyes met mine. I think we were both having the same thought. 

“Ma’am, are you feeling okay?” she asked as she cautiously touched the woman’s shoulder, applying almost no pressure. 

“M…m…m…my…my daughter, my little girl.” She looked straight into McIntyre’s face. “Shhhhhe…she…she was s-s-ssick. Is she okay?”

“Hush now, child, you are in a house of god. All is well.” She signaled for me to close the door, and I did so, trying to make as little noise as possible. The flashlight’s cone remained on the woman like a spotlight.

“A house… of god, yes.” She looked at McIntyre’s garb. Her hands were held out as if they were placed on a table. Like she was trying not to touch anything with them, but the bones were limp, only connected by cartilage. “But you are a woman,” she exclaimed. “What trick is this!” she was yelling now. 

I heard Bear bark from the door on the opposite side. The one we came through. He was standing there watching with the little girl at his side. 

“Maribelle? The woman’s eyes lit up.” The supposed Maribelle looked at the woman with apprehension. She took off, Bear followed her, and the woman desperately rushed towards the door. “Maribelle, my baby, it’s just me!” She stood and began running towards the door. I grabbed one of her arms to hold her in place, but she responded by turning around and slapping me with her free hand. The bare bone hurt like a motherfucker and I think I actually blacked out for a second. Next thing I knew, I had a candlestick in my hand, and I was heading up to the altar with McIntyre right behind me.     

We found the three of them in a standoff, dead center in the nave between the rows of pews. Bear stood between them, growling.

“Come now, Maribelle, tell little pooch to calm down. I won’t hurt you.” She inched closer, much to Bear’s disapproval. “I must take you from these aberrations of satan, child. They seek to corrupt you!” 

She hadn’t noticed me at that point, so, as quietly as possible, I snuck up behind her. When I was close enough, I hit her over the top of the head with the candlestick as hard as I could. She dropped to the floor.

“Again!” not Maribelle yelled at me, rushing over. “Again!” I gave her an odd look, but before I put two and two together, the woman leapt up. Being caught completely off guard, she was able to wrap her bone fingers around my neck. She pressed hard. I tried to let out a scream, but all that came out was a high-pitched wheezing sound. “Stop It!” I could hear the kid flailing against her back. She stopped when Bear let out a really loud bark. I tried to fight her off, but my vision began to blur pretty quick and my legs gave out. Causing the two of us to fall to the floor. 

Just as I was about to clock out, I saw Bear go straight for the woman’s scalp. He bit down on her hair and pulled as hard as he could. McIntyre and the kid grabbed onto him and began to pull as well.

I could see the skin being stretched out further and further away, but she did not seem fazed. In fact, she was laughing. As her hair was pulled out, as the skin began to tear, as the bare white of her skull was revealed, she laughed. Not once did she loosen her grip on my neck or budge. When Bear began biting at her face, I finally passed out. 

I came to in a pile of viscera and blood. I immediately sat up and made a loud gasping noise, then I realized they had actually moved me out of the pile of guts, and I was just sitting on whatever was on my back or soaked into my clothes. Bear had been lying next to me, so he jumped up and started licking my face. Dog saliva is better than dried blood all over your face, so I didn’t fight him for a couple of seconds. 

I stood and noticed McIntyre sitting in a pew not far away. She was humming, and the little girl had her head in her lap, sleeping.

“Is she okay?” I asked. She looked at me oddly.

“She’s fine, are you okay?”

I looked over myself, my neck was sore, but not too bad considering. “Yeah, I think I’m good.”

“Nate.” She looked serious. “You didn’t have a pulse.” I looked at her, confused.

“I died?” 

She nodded.

“Holy shit.”

“Do you remember anything?”

Up until now, I had no memory of the time between Bear eating the woman’s face off and waking up. But as I tried to dig for something, I realized there was a faint memory. No images, no sounds, just a feeling. The feeling that I was somewhere else, somewhere I hadn’t been in a long time, and I was just then realizing I desperately missed. When I told her this, she put her head in her hands and began crying.

“God help us,” she said.

“What’s wrong?”

“Examine what remains, and you’ll see what is to become of us.”

With a dose of reticence, I walked back to where I had been lying. There was blood, pieces of tissue, and internal organs in various states of disrepair. Then I heard her. She wasn’t saying anything, just babbling, but as her head came into view, I saw her eyes shift, comprehending me. She continued muttering as I observed the liquid blood slowly crawling its way back to the head. It moved at a snail’s pace, almost imperceptible. I’m certain her other body parts were moving as well, but since the blood was still liquified, which in itself is odd, its movement was more easily seen. 

“Oh my god!” I shouted as an epiphany struck me. I asked McIntyre for a shovel and went out back to the cemetery that the woman came from. I found her grave, exhumed. The name on her headstone was Maribeth Shirley, 1845-1870. 

My anxiety continued to build as I approached the graves of my mother and father. I don’t know how long I stood there. I already knew the truth, but I didn’t want ot prove it. Eventually, I bent down and put my ear to the grass. I could hear them. They were making a muffled noise. I couldn’t make it out at first, but eventually I came to realize they were wailing.

I know god is supposed to have a plan. I wish I knew what it was. I wish he would tell me whether it would be better to simply leave or to start digging before anyone else gets desperate enough to escape their grave.",1,1767410076.0,u_SpikeSpiegal309,0,1.0,False

4:30 PM

When I took the dispatcher position back in my hometown, I didn’t think I would have to deal with the kinds of things I’ve had to deal with today. It is now 4:30 PM Christmas Day as I write this. I’m hoping that I can get this posted before the end of the day so I can warn as many people as possible. You don’t want to be caught unaware of what’s going on right now. 

I am assuming that this is going on everywhere, but I don’t know that for sure right now. Although I am certain that you will agree with my assumption once you have read to the end of this post. Also, please forgive me if I ramble. I am very frantically typing this at the moment, and I may occasionally tangent to relieve stress. I don’t really have time to edit this, and it is a necessary coping mechanism, so deal with it. Please.

For context, I live in a small midwestern town, corn, soy, and grain country. I had just finished college and was experiencing some heavy burnout. I took the job back home, I think, because I needed some newfound sense of direction. Up until that point, I had been following a path laid out for me, not that I hadn’t made my own decisions, but I was making those choices with the eye of others in mind. I didn’t care about that anymore. Local dispatch for my hometown was the first opportunity where I thought I would be helpful, as in helping people, not somebody’s profit margin.

The only problem is I hate cops. I don’t know for certain what the origin of calling them pigs is, but I like to think it has to do with them basically being the state’s clean-up crew. In the sense that pigs served as the mob’s clean-up crew. I ended up taking the job because I knew a few of the cops from when I was a kid, and the sergeant in charge helped me out one time. I thought I could do some good with these personal connections. But now, I don’t know what any single person can do about anything anymore.

My family wasn’t around, so I decided to work Christmas Day at the station. Earlier in the month, it had snowed a ton, but now there was nothing but a thick layer of mist that made everything it touched wet. I hate 100% humidity. It makes my whole body sticky and uncomfortable. Regardless, I was inside quickly enough that it didn’t bother me too much. The sergeant, I’ll call him Bill, and his deputy, Greg, were the only two cops on call that day.

“Well, hey there, Nate, I hope you slept well?” Bill spoke with a deep baritone from under a bristly white mustache. 

“Yeah,” I said, evading the question. I began setting up my desk the way I liked it. I had my police mojo computer on my right and my own personal laptop on my left, which I was planning to watch Queen’s Gambit on.

“Good to hear it. Well, I’ll let you get to it. Me and Greg are gonna go get some coffee. So give us a call if anything explodes.” 

I smiled at him. “Will do.” He gave me a nod and walked away. I felt the rumble of their cruiser as it started. 

During this time, I was the only dispatcher on duty for my area, which was large, but didn’t even have one person per square mile on average. So, I was the lonely watchmen. A skeleton crew was normal, as this day was usually pretty uneventful out here, but I was worried about the fog and car accidents. I decided to raid the break room for snacks. On my way back, I passed by the front door for what would’ve been the second time. I was some distance from it down the hall, but as it perceived me, I felt a shiver run through my whole body. A huge deer, shrouded in fog from the bottom of the neck down, was staring through the clear glass of the front door. Staring at me as I held my bags of chips, cookies, and shit. It didn’t move, but its empty black eyes followed me as I receded towards my little office. I threw everything on my desk, then peeked back down the hall. It was gone.

“What the fuck,” I spat it out as if just then realising what happened. It didn’t look alive, closer to a taxidermied trophy.  

Any thinking I could’ve done was interrupted by a 911 call. I quickly sat at my desk, took a deep breath, and picked it up. “911, what’s your emergency?”

“It’s Earl!” I recognized the voice on the other end.

“Margaret? It’s Nate. Is Earl having another heart attack?” As I spoke, I entered her address and held the mouse over the button that would dispatch an ambulance. 

“Oh, Nate! Yes, he’s… he’s.  OH MY GOD!” I dispatched the ambulance, emphasizing emergency.

“Margaret? Are you okay?”

“He’s dead, he’s dead.”

“It’s okay, Mrs. Adler. The ambulance is already on its way, they’re gonna help him.”

“No, I…I felt his pulse go.” She started crying. 

I radioed Bill, muting the call. “Bill, I just sent an ambulance to the Adler residence. It’s not looking good, so you might want to head over.”

“Roger that.”

I heard Margaret wheezing and moving quickly, then the slam of a door, followed by more crying. “I can’t believe he’s dead. Oh my god, he’s dead.”

“Margaret, Bill’s gonna be there soon, okay?”

“Okay,” she said. Then an almost thunderous knocking.

“Margaret? Is everything okay?” 

I looked over at the GPS map. Bill was eight minutes away. The ambulance was four minutes away. Margaret gave nothing in reply other than a short intake of breath. I heard a doorknob twist and creak. Then a frantic movement and a click. She locked it.

“Margaret, was anyone else in the house with you?”

“No,” she whispered. “I had my finger on his pulse the whole time. That is not my husband.”

“Margaret? Why’d you lock me out?” It sounded like him. I have since googled Lazarus Sydrome but at the time, I assumed this was impossible, which it might as well have been. Regardless, the real thing that scared me was that Margaret didn’t trust it. In this situation, she should be in denial of his death, not of his life. 

“Don’t open the door,” I said. “The ambulance is three minutes away.”

“Margaret! Please! I’ve been to the other side, I can tell you! I can tell! I can tell! I can tell you! Margaret!” I heard a loud bang against the door. “That’s okay. You’ll find out soon enough anyways.” I heard muffled receding footsteps. Time passed in silence. I heard a more distant knock after the paramedics arrived. Then she hung up. I sat there for a moment. I don’t know how long. Another call came in. I answered.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Um… my-my name is Eddy.” The voice sounded like a young boy’s

“Okay, Eddy, what’s going on?”

“Um…a car hit us. Really hard.”

“Do you know where you are?”

“No, it hit on my mom’s side. She’s not moving.” I heard him start to cry.

“Is the driver of the other car still there?”

“He flew.”

“What do you mean?”

“He wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. He hit our car too.” 

I almost said “fuck me” out loud. This was not at all the stress level I was anticipating for the day.

“Who’s on the phone!?” I heard a man’s voice yell.

“Is that him?” He sounded fine. Then I remembered the last call.

“Yeah.”

“Eddy?” I heard a much sweeter voice.

“You stupid fucking bitch!” I heard screaming.

“Eddy, run down the street until you find a street sign okay?” I heard no response. “Eddy?” somebody hung up. “FUCK!!” I yelled. I was beginning to panic. I felt my chest tighten, and I began to cry as I spiraled down thoughts of uselessness. “What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?” I repeated to myself over and over again. Then I wrote this. I’ll let you know if anything else happens out here.

Thank you for reading 

Even though there’s nothing you can do

7 PM

Bill and Greg returned to the station sometime after that and found me in my office with my head in my arms.

“You okay there, Nate?” I looked up into his eyes. He looked tired. 

“Yeah, what happened to Margaret?” He sighed and thought for a moment. Instead of responding, he waved his arm and walked away. I rolled myself and my chair into the hall. “What do we do now?” I asked. The phone rang, and I went back into the office. Bill started walking back towards me. I picked up.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“I’m at Skeeter’s Pub, and there’s a guy with a gun.”

“Okay, is he threatening people with it?”

“Not yet, but him and this guy keep getting at it with each other. They’ve been here since before I got here, so I think they’re both drunk.”

“Alright, a coupleof  officers are on the way.” 

I muted myself as she said, “Thank you.”

“Armed drunkard at Skeeter’s pub” I looked at Bill. I’d never seen him scared like that before.

“Goddamnit, Greg, let’s go. Stay on the phone and keep us updated, Nate!” They left. 

“Ma’am can you get yourself out of the pub?”

“Not without moving past them, I’d rather just stay here.”

“Fuck you!” I heard from a distance. Then a loud pop followed by lots of screaming.

“Oh my god, he shot him,” she was whispering now. “No wait, did he miss?”

“No way,” I heard another voice. “I saw it go straight through his head.”

“What the fuck? He’s getting back up.”

“The man who was shot?” I asked.

“Yeah, he got shot in the head and just got back up. The other guys doesn’t know what to do.” I heard several more gunshots. 

“AHHHH!” A scream followed by a repetitive banging.

“Holy shit, he’s just smashing his face on the bar.”

“FREEZE!” I heard Bill yell. Something wet slid and then dropped onto the floor.

“I think the other guy is dead.” A wet gurgle and a fit of coughing followed. “Uh…I uh…”

“What’s happening?”

“He… got back up. What the fuck!? He got back up like it was nothing!?”

Pandemonium and several more gunshots followed before I lost connection. 

Am I anything but an observer?

Do I have the power to change things?

My shift ends soon

I guess I’ll go home

11AM

Hello everyone, I'm still hunkered down at home. I went back to the station to check on Bill and the guys and they gave me a copy of the police report. They're technically not supposed to do that, but who gives a fuck at this point?

Regardless, here is the report. I changed names, phone numbers, and such, but most of it was left as is. Just so you know, this report is wack. Read at your own discretion. 

[https://imgur.com/a/o2zSEmE](https://imgur.com/a/o2zSEmE)

I might go see Msg. McIntyre. I haven't been to church in a long time, and I'm starting to think this is some apocalypse shit. The more I think about what's happening with just this information, the more I scare myself with the potential implications. Even if the event is localised.

But that's not what has me scared at this very moment.

I had a dream last night. I'll try to remember it as best I can, which, as I’m writing this, turns out to be surprisingly easy.

I woke up and used the bathroom. I was already dreaming at this point, but I didn't know that. When I finished in the bathroom, the warm sun was out. It made me want to have a productive day, so I went to the kitchen and prepared myself a high-protein breakfast.

""Sleep well, honey?"" she asked.

""Yeah, pretty good.""

""What's the plan for the day?"" he asked.

""Hopefully something productive."" I turned around to serve a plate of sausage and eggs, but all I saw was two taxidermied deer sitting at the dinner table. Their legs and arms were malformed so that they sat like humans. I served both of them plates anyway. They didn't eat.

""You okay there, bud?"" he asked. Mouth unmoving.

""Yeah, I just."" My eyes began to sting, and tears formed. ""I just... don't know what's happening."" I put my head in my hands.

""Ohh, that's okay, honey."" I didn't hear her move, but I felt warmer, like she was close to me. ""No one does.""

“It’s too much mom. It’s all too much.”

“I know, honey. It’s okay. Everything will be okay.”

I looked up to see an empty dinner table, except for one occupant at the head to my right. I knew who it was immediately. His head bloomed like a flower, and he took forceful, wet breaths through broken airways. Sputtering blood with each motion, he shook as if in a great deal of pain.

""Ray?""

I woke up. My bed was drenched in sweat. I've been trying to stay calm the whole day. I really miss them. I was breaking down, basically rolling around the floor like I was on fire, until Bear lay on top of me. I'm going to the morning service tomorrow. At the very least, I'll meet people who might know more than me. The fog still blankets everything I can see, maybe a foot away from all the windows. I keep imagining the dark shapes of deer at the border.

8AM

With the wall of white mist still obscuring most of my vision, I drove down the corn-flanked country road. Since I knew the town well, it didn’t take me long to find the church. The parking lot was empty, and the building itself stood as a giant shadow in the fog. I grabbed the go bag I packed and leashed up Bear. 

As we approached the front door, Bear turned around, started panting, and whimpered. I placed my hand on the doorknocker before turning around to see what was behind me. There was nothing but fog. Then I blinked. 

In a perfect semicircle at the edge of the fog were a ton of taxidermied deer, all facing the church door, or me. I began knocking somewhat frantically. McIntyre opened the door and quickly pulled me in as Bear pushed from behind. She then closed and locked the door.

“Nate, my son. I am glad to see you are okay.”

“Same to you.” We hugged each other, which was something we had never done before, but she was always good at figuring out what people needed, and a hug was pretty high on my list. I relaxed a bit after that.

“We have another lost soul seeking refuge.” She pointed to a young girl, maybe eleven or twelve, who was sitting in one of the pews. “She hasn’t spoken since arriving, but she is alone as far as I can tell.” It was at this point that I realized my position in this situation. I’m still getting used to being an adult. My response to this realization was to “man up.” I constantly rotated around the various windows of the church. Even though I couldn’t see shit, I figured this was the best way to make sure no one snuck in. Also, this way I could let someone in if needed, and they wouldn’t have to go through the trouble of knocking. I don’t know, it made sense to me at the time.

10AM

At some point, we heard a distant-sounding scream. It came from behind the church.

“What’s back there?” I asked McIntyre.

“Just the cemetery.” We looked at eachother and acknowledged the fear in both of us. She muttered a silent prayer.

I quietly whispered, “fuck me.” I told Bear to stay near the child. The screaming grew closer until there was a loud thud on the back door, which was out of sight to us in the nave. The thud was followed by wailing and repeated banging.

“Help!” we heard muffled. This stirred both McIntyre and me, and we went down into the sacristy together. We were under the altar then, so there was no light. McIntyre turned on a flashlight, revealing the shuddering door. She didn’t hesitate. She opened it.

“Praise god!” the woman yelled as she almost fell inside. Dull grey light washed over the sacristy. 

I immediately noticed something was very wrong. She was wearing an old, tattered dress that was filthy, along with a bonnet on top of her head, which was in slightly better condition. 

A bonnet?

Even out here, people don’t really wear those anymore. 

I didn’t pursue that thought further as she suddenly barfed up what I can only describe as grave leavings. There were worms, chunks of dirt, and even mushrooms that were attached to the dirt chunks.  Then I saw her hands. I blinked several times in disbelief as I realised the meat of them was gone. There was a point in which the skin just stopped, a red border of coagulated, undulating blood preceded naked bone. Shreds of skin still patched her hands. Scraps clinging. McIntyre’s eyes met mine. I think we were both having the same thought. 

“Ma’am, are you feeling okay?” she asked as she cautiously touched the woman’s shoulder, applying almost no pressure. 

“M…m…m…my…my daughter, my little girl.” She looked straight into McIntyre’s face. “Shhhhhe…she…she was s-s-ssick. Is she okay?”

“Hush now, child, you are in a house of god. All is well.” She signaled for me to close the door, and I did so, trying to make as little noise as possible. The flashlight’s cone remained on the woman like a spotlight.

“A house… of god, yes.” She looked at McIntyre’s garb. Her hands were held out as if they were placed on a table. Like she was trying not to touch anything with them, but the bones were limp, only connected by cartilage. “But you are a woman,” she exclaimed. “What trick is this!” she was yelling now. 

I heard Bear bark from the door on the opposite side. The one we came through. He was standing there watching with the little girl at his side. 

“Maribelle? The woman’s eyes lit up.” The supposed Maribelle looked at the woman with apprehension. She took off, Bear followed her, and the woman desperately rushed towards the door. “Maribelle, my baby, it’s just me!” She stood and began running towards the door. I grabbed one of her arms to hold her in place, but she responded by turning around and slapping me with her free hand. The bare bone hurt like a motherfucker and I think I actually blacked out for a second. Next thing I knew, I had a candlestick in my hand, and I was heading up to the altar with McIntyre right behind me.     

We found the three of them in a standoff, dead center in the nave between the rows of pews. Bear stood between them, growling.

“Come now, Maribelle, tell little pooch to calm down. I won’t hurt you.” She inched closer, much to Bear’s disapproval. “I must take you from these aberrations of satan, child. They seek to corrupt you!” 

She hadn’t noticed me at that point, so, as quietly as possible, I snuck up behind her. When I was close enough, I hit her over the top of the head with the candlestick as hard as I could. She dropped to the floor.

“Again!” not Maribelle yelled at me, rushing over. “Again!” I gave her an odd look, but before I put two and two together, the woman leapt up. Being caught completely off guard, she was able to wrap her bone fingers around my neck. She pressed hard. I tried to let out a scream, but all that came out was a high-pitched wheezing sound. “Stop It!” I could hear the kid flailing against her back. She stopped when Bear let out a really loud bark. I tried to fight her off, but my vision began to blur pretty quick and my legs gave out. Causing the two of us to fall to the floor. 

Just as I was about to clock out, I saw Bear go straight for the woman’s scalp. He bit down on her hair and pulled as hard as he could. McIntyre and the kid grabbed onto him and began to pull as well.

I could see the skin being stretched out further and further away, but she did not seem fazed. In fact, she was laughing. As her hair was pulled out, as the skin began to tear, as the bare white of her skull was revealed, she laughed. Not once did she loosen her grip on my neck or budge. When Bear began biting at her face, I finally passed out. 

I came to in a pile of viscera and blood. I immediately sat up and made a loud gasping noise, then I realized they had actually moved me out of the pile of guts, and I was just sitting on whatever was on my back or soaked into my clothes. Bear had been lying next to me, so he jumped up and started licking my face. Dog saliva is better than dried blood all over your face, so I didn’t fight him for a couple of seconds. 

I stood and noticed McIntyre sitting in a pew not far away. She was humming, and the little girl had her head in her lap, sleeping.

“Is she okay?” I asked. She looked at me oddly.

“She’s fine, are you okay?”

I looked over myself, my neck was sore, but not too bad considering. “Yeah, I think I’m good.”

“Nate.” She looked serious. “You didn’t have a pulse.” I looked at her, confused.

“I died?” 

She nodded.

“Holy shit.”

“Do you remember anything?”

Up until now, I had no memory of the time between Bear eating the woman’s face off and waking up. But as I tried to dig for something, I realized there was a faint memory. No images, no sounds, just a feeling. The feeling that I was somewhere else, somewhere I hadn’t been in a long time, and I was just then realizing I desperately missed. When I told her this, she put her head in her hands and began crying.

“God help us,” she said.

“What’s wrong?”

“Examine what remains, and you’ll see what is to become of us.”

With a dose of reticence, I walked back to where I had been lying. There was blood, pieces of tissue, and internal organs in various states of disrepair. Then I heard her. She wasn’t saying anything, just babbling, but as her head came into view, I saw her eyes shift, comprehending me.

I've been researching social psychology, communication studies, and human behavior for months now (books, podcasts, research papers, the whole deal) because I kept finding myself replaying cringe moments at 3am. Turns out, most of us are wired to catastrophize embarrassing situations way more than necessary. Our brains evolved to care deeply about social standing because being cast out of the tribe meant death. So yeah, that time you called your teacher ""mom"" in 5th grade still haunts you for a reason, but it doesn't have to control you.

The good news? You can actually rewire how you respond to awkward moments. It's not about becoming perfect or never embarrassing yourself again. That's impossible and honestly boring. It's about developing the skills to recover quickly and stop the mental spiral that makes everything worse.

## 1. Understand that everyone's too busy worrying about themselves

Here's something that genuinely changed my perspective. Most people remember your embarrassing moment for like 5 minutes max before going back to obsessing over their own lives. There's actual research on this called the ""spotlight effect"" (studied extensively by Thomas Gilovich at Cornell). We overestimate how much others notice or care about our mistakes by roughly 50%.

Think about the last time someone around you did something mildly awkward. Can you even remember what it was? Probably not. That's exactly how much other people are thinking about your fumbles.

The book ""The Confidence Code"" by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman breaks this down beautifully. They interviewed hundreds of successful people and found that confidence isn't about never messing up, it's about caring less when you do. Insanely good read if you struggle with overthinking social situations. This book will make you question everything you think you know about self doubt and performance anxiety.

## 2. Own it immediately instead of pretending nothing happened

The worst thing you can do in an embarrassing moment is act like it didn't happen. Everyone noticed. The tension builds. It gets weirder.

Instead, acknowledge it with humor or brevity. Spilled coffee on yourself during a presentation? ""Well, that's one way to wake up"" then move on. Said something accidentally inappropriate? ""That came out wrong, let me try again."" The acknowledgment releases the tension for everyone, including you.

Dr. Brené Brown talks about this extensively in her podcast ""Unlocking Us"". She calls it ""clearing"". When you name the awkwardness, you take away its power. I cannot recommend her work enough for understanding shame and vulnerability. She's a research professor who spent decades studying these exact situations, and her insights are genuinely life changing.

## 3. Develop a 5 second reset ritual

This is practical as hell. When something embarrassing happens, you need a mental circuit breaker to stop the shame spiral before it starts.

I learned this technique from the book ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane. She recommends a physical reset, take a deep breath, relax your shoulders, make eye contact with someone friendly if possible. The physical shift interrupts the mental panic.

You can also try what improv comedians do. They have a rule called ""yes, and"" where they accept whatever happens and build on it rather than fighting reality. Applied to real life, this means accepting ""ok, that just happened"" and immediately focusing on what's next rather than replaying what just occurred.

The app ""Finch"" is actually surprisingly helpful here for building these kinds of mental habits. It's designed for general self care but includes exercises for managing anxiety and developing resilience in social situations. You basically raise a little bird while working on personal goals, sounds weird but it genuinely helps reinforce positive coping mechanisms.

## 4. Reframe embarrassment as a sign you're pushing boundaries

This might sound like toxic positivity but hear me out. If you never embarrass yourself, you're probably playing it too safe. Every comedian bombs sometimes. Every public speaker flubs lines. Every person who's ever asked someone out has faced rejection.

The researcher Carol Dweck calls this a ""growth mindset"" in her work on learning and development. Embarrassing moments are data points, not judgments on your worth as a person. They show you're actually out there trying things instead of hiding.

I started keeping a log of my awkward moments (sounds masochistic I know) but writing them down made me realize how quickly they lose their power. A week later they're funny stories. A month later you barely remember them. ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear talks about this kind of reframing. It's technically about habit formation but the principle applies, small shifts in how you interpret events create massive changes in behavior over time. Best productivity book I've ever read, hands down.

BeFreed is a personalized learning app that pulls from expert sources to create custom podcasts based on whatever skill or growth area you're working on. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it generates audio content from books, research papers, and expert talks tailored to your specific goals. 

For confidence and social skills, you can ask it to create learning plans around handling awkward situations or building resilience. The depth is adjustable, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and actionable strategies. The virtual coach feature lets you customize everything from voice style to tone, whether you want something objective or more conversational. Worth checking out if you're serious about structured self-improvement without adding more screen time.

## 5. Practice recovery in low stakes situations

You can actually train yourself to handle embarrassment better, like a muscle. Start intentionally doing mildly awkward things in low consequence environments. Ask a stranger for directions when you already know the way. Wear mismatched socks to the grocery store. Send a text to the wrong person (nothing too weird obviously).

This is exposure therapy lite. The more you experience small doses of social discomfort and realize nothing bad happens, the less your brain freaks out during genuinely embarrassing moments.

The podcast ""The Happiness Lab"" with Dr. Laurie Santos (Yale professor) has an entire episode on this called ""Don't Think of the White Bear"". It's about how trying to suppress embarrassing thoughts makes them stronger, while exposure and acceptance actually diminishes them. Super interesting neuroscience behind why our instincts about handling shame are usually backwards.

## 6. Remember that authenticity beats perfection

People connect with humans, not polished robots. Some of the most liked people I know are the ones who laugh at themselves and don't take everything so seriously.

There's a reason comedians who share embarrassing stories are so popular. Vulnerability is relatable. Obviously don't trauma dump on everyone you meet, but being willing to acknowledge when something awkward happens makes you more likeable, not less.

The book ""Daring Greatly"" by Brené Brown (yeah, her again, she's that good) explores this concept deeply. She argues that shame loses power when it's spoken. The people who seem most confident aren't the ones who never mess up, they're the ones who've made peace with being imperfect. This is the best book on shame and vulnerability you'll find anywhere.

## 7. Build general confidence so individual moments matter less

When your self worth is built on a solid foundation, individual embarrassing moments don't shake you as much. Work on things that genuinely make you feel capable and competent. Develop skills, pursue hobbies, maintain good relationships, take care of your physical health.

It's not that these things prevent embarrassment, but they give you enough positive self regard that one awkward moment doesn't define your entire identity.

Look, you're going to have awkward moments. We all do. The goal isn't perfection, it's resilience. It's being able to laugh it off, learn what you can, and move forward without letting it rent space in your head for the next five years. That's genuinely the only difference between people who seem unshakeable and those who spiral, they've just practiced bouncing back.",2,1767409710.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

The son of a laborer father and a prostitute mother, Vincent's parents barely had any time for their son, leaving him in the hands of indifferent babysitters who barely gave the boy any thought. School was hardly any better. His teachers paid Vincent little attention even when he did well. As such, Vincent grew up almost completely isolated, causing him to crave attention. He became both a bully and a bully victim, both of which strangely seemed to please him because it meant attention. The only time Vincent got even the smallest amount of attention from his parents was when they attended church. But instead of feeling Gods peace, Vincent grew jealous of God because of all the praise He got and all the wrath He unleashed.

When America entered WW1 in 1917, Vincent tried to enlist under a false form but was denied because of his eyesight which required glasses. He continued to try and enlist under different fake forums and even tried faking good eyesight, but eventually Vincent was arrested for fraud shortly after his 18th birthday. By the time Vincent was released, WW1 was over.

With Vincent having a criminal record, few people wanted to hire him. He spent most of his young adult life doing odd jobs across Richmond, and continued to get little to no attention, driving Vincent's ego up more and more. When television was invented in the late 20's/early 30's, Vincent grew smitten and fascinated with it. The attention people on TV got, that would give him the attention and fame he so desired. Vincent spent decades trying to get a role as an actor for a play or TV show or movie, but no matter how hard he tried, he never got a role.

When Vincent turned 50, as did the 20th century, his fortunes began to turn. In stroke of luck, he landed a job at the channel 6 news... as a weather forecaster. At first, Vincent was overjoyed, but soon learned he had to share the news with another reporter who got more attention because he delivered more important news. With Vincent now no longer in the prime of his life, and not satisfied with his attention, decades of loneliness turned sour and the man finally snapped and vowed to go even farther to get attention.

One day, Vincent invited the reporter for coffee at an address whose route would go past an allyway few people ventured. There, Vincent killed the reporter and hid the body. When the reporter was reported missing and later found dead, Vincent was offered to take the man's role, which he accepted happily. But he treated the woman reporter his predecessor worked with with disdain and even tried to have her fired.

A few years later, the network Vincent worked for aired a talk show which saw more rating then Vincent's reporter job. His jealousy grew again and he planned to once again kill and replace someone. After watching the show's host for a few weeks, Vincent noticed he liked to arrive at the studio early so he'd have more time to mentally prepare for being on live tv. Vincent ambushed the host on the set and beat him to death with his own equipment and even framed a studio janitor for the crime.

Vincent soon became the new host and became a sensation almost overnight. But not even this was enough. Because the previous killings showed Vincent another side he never noticed... he enjoyed killing and watching people suffer. Vincent then realized it wasn't attention he craved... it was power. And there were still those who had power over him and still forced him to share attention. So over the next few years, Vincent murdered his producers and the heads of the other shows on the network just to keep audiences glued to him and him alone, and to call shots in the studio.

As Vincent's power and praise grew, people began nicknaming him ""The God of Entertainment."" But Vincent took this too close to heart and began to actually believe himself a God. Next he went for his next target, the boss of the whole studio, Robert Sinclair. Fearing that another murder could attract too much attention, Vincent tried to persuade Sinclair to give him the studio, but Sinclair refused, starting to suspect that Vincent was not the man he claimed to be. Soon after that, Vincent kidnapped his boss and dangled him on the building and forced him to sign over the studio. Sinclair oblidged, but Vincent was drunk with power and murdered his boss.

But murdering Sinclair ended up being Vincent's downfall. With him juggling multiple responsibilities, Vincent nearly bankrupted the studio. Additionally, people began to suspect that all the murders that cause Vincent to rise in popularity were caused by him and the police began investigating him. Vincent moved the studio to another building and tried to lower his profile by cutting costs. He fired technicians and other people who ensured that sound stages and sets were safe to use and crudely put together his own stage.

Despite the investigations and technical dangers, Vincent's new cult show became a sensation. On his cult show, he used manipulation and brainwashing to make his audience and crew believe that he was a persecuted man and that the world was persecuting his audience with endless slop shows that did the same things over and over again. Additionally as the Civil Rights movement gained more ground and resistance, Vincent attracted white supremacists to his show by vilifying non-white people and that he could lead white people into a brighter future. But eventually, Vincent's cut corners got the best of him when a tv he crudely hung in his studio fell on his head killing him and his audience almost instantly. Vincent was 59. 7 months before his 60th birthday.

Further investigations after that caused authorities to learn that Vincent was in fact a killer and gained his power and influence by killing all who stood in his way and gained more attention. Some even theorized that Vincent was actually assassinated by a friend or family member of one of his victims. Vincent's body was buried in a nameless grave with the tv still on his head, and the world moved on without him. Many decades later, those who had been murdered or survived his reign of terror, were shocked when Vincent, now a demon by the name of Vox, hijacked their Heavenly TV and threatened to kill them all.",1,1767409307.0,HazbinHotel,0,1.0,False
1q2j4bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q2j4bv/relationship_boundaries/,Relationship Boundaries,"Recently, I started dating this amazing woman. 22f, I’m a 23m. We both work at a Dutch Bros coffee shop and have been dating for 5 months now. A little context, I started working there where I met her a little over a year ago. In the time that we were friends, I got my best buddy a job there too as he needed one for college. We all would got for food or drinks after work when we were all simply just friends. Recently, I found that my gf and my best friend would send Tik toks to eachother, A LOT of tik toks to eachother. The same best buddy happens to show up on his off days to make a drink and conveniently show up on the days my gf works to hang out while she’s working (weirdest thing ever). 

   I’ve spoken to my gf about it and she feels remorseful as she didn’t know how that affected me and changed her behavior, but she did explain her side. So I felt bad, on the other hand. My best buddy started to make jokes that i “ignore him” “don’t hang out” “tell your gf bad things about me” and such. He makes a lot of jokes that feel they carry underlying meanings of being angry at me, or my gf. I recently started feeling that he likes her and it makes me feel like a bad friend or a bad bf. Like idk who to accuse or who to question and I’ve felt I need to take my gfs side as she’s completely honest with me and even with a conversation with my buddy it seems like it goes nowhere. I just find it weird that he’s said “it’s mindless scrolling and memes” and that he’s comfortable with her because I’m his best friend and it’s weird if he isn’t the same way with my gf. Or that “they were friends too” before we dated. He also finds ways to pity himself onto either dates with me and my gf or hangouts where it’s just supposed to be us. I will say no but my gf will feel bad and let him come. Idk what to do or say but it’s exhausting me. ",1,1767409293.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1q2j34y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q2j34y/should_i_live_with_my_parents_while_attending/,Should I live with my parents while attending college?,"Background with my family dynamic then paragraphs of situations that make me think i should live on campus.

I(18F) live with my parents, both 37, and my three younger siblings, 13, 11, and 3. (I am purposefully being vague on their genders) I am the oldest. My parents had me young, my dad at 19 and my mom two days before 19. After I was born, my dad finished trade school and became an Automotive Technician. He now runs his own business out of his Polebarn on our property. My mom graduated high school to become a beautician but dropped out right before getting her certificate. She went to college for a couple different things after that, but never stuck with them so she has no degree. She became a stay at home mom and will probably be unemployed forever. She has blamed me for her not finishing college before in arguments.

When I was young my parents fought a lot but as they have gotten older, its not as frequent. 

She doesn't really raise us though. She spends most of her time scrolling Facebook and criticizing us. Like weaponized incompetence. And almost everything brings up her awful childhood and how her sisters hated her for ""no reason"". (I don't think it was for no reason) I theorize that that why she let's my 11 yo sibling get away with everything: because my 13 yo sibling and I don't act as warmly with 11yo, and they remind her of herself as a child. They're becoming an awful person, just like our mom. 

But both of them are like her that way too. The weaponized incompetence. and im really sick of being blamed for their misdeeds. She doesn't scold them, just slightly disappointed variants of their name being said without her looking up from her phone. Meanwhile I could get grounded for a month for getting mad about homework. She doesn't like when I shake my head.

That's another thing, homework. My 11th grade year, I was doing homework from 3:30pm to 11pm every night because of AP classes. And all I got was shit from it. It was always, ""Are you STILL doing that?"" or ""When will you be done , you have to clean this up"" Like she hadn't been the one to convince me to take them. And now that im in 12th grade I can't come home and do homework. I immediately have to clean because she won't while we're at school. She'll brag about the 4 hour long nap she took while we were gone. My dad will come inside around 8pm asking if we got our homework done, and when we say that we havent started, she completely switches up and starts yelling about how shes been telling us to and we just don't listen. She is diagnosed bipolar if you couldn't tell :) and she won't take the medication for it that she purposefully had a brakedown in front of our doctor for.

My youngest sibling is 3, they're still a baby. and babies have tantrums. I have gotten extremely good at distracting/calming them down from tantrums. and i have to use this skill to get my sibling away from my mom because she'll say things like, ""If you don't get them away from me right now, im going to beat them.""

During one of the few yelling matches my parents had recently, my 3yo sibling came with me into the bathroom while I showered, because they didn't want to be alone. They have also called me mom on multiple occasions. They are amazing but i also cant help but worry. After they calling me mom they get really nervous around our actual mom. It like they think they'll get yelled at. 

I have a black cat named Nyx that my mom hates. She is constantly making death threats about him to me, simply for walking through the dining room. Having Nyx has helped my with my depression.

I was getting a sports physical for Tennis at an immediate care center because my doctors office didn't have space for a last minute appt. and i answered all of the mental health questions truthfully (I have diagnosed depression and anxiety) because why wouldn't i? they are doctors, why wouldn't I be honest? they know more than me. Anyway, a doctor came in and told my mom and I that, unless I changed my answers, he would have to send me to the psych place. then he gave me a blank physical. I changed my answers. yes, I know what that doctor did was wrong but the problem is that my mom wasnt at all concerned about me or my answers, just that he had threatened to take me away. 

At cousins birthday parties, my mom makes sure to complain about how ""awful"" her kids are and made sure to tell all of my family members that I had started my first period the day before. 

My 11yo sibling had a phase two years ago during the summer where they faked falling to say they were pushed. Most of the time they were smiling because they thought it was funny. I should note that because it was summer, my dad was working throughout the day and hadnt previously seen them do this bit. Once, they did it in front of me to blame me for pushing them but they were able to keep a straight face. The only other person in the house was my dad who slapped me for it and asked how I liked it. My 11yo sibling was laughing while I tried telling him it was fake. He didn't completely believe me.

Because I lied as a kid I can never be trusted. I could be telling the truth and I'm interrupted and dismissed as a liar. I hate lying, it makes me sick to my stomach. but I could never tell mom that or I would be called a liar again.

My mom has told me that she doesn't like me as much as my siblings because they were all planned, and only my dad planned me. I know this isn't true because my 3yo sibling wasnt planned.

I have diagnosed chronic migraines. At one point, I had them five to six times a week. I don't have them that often anymore(now twice a week) because of my everyday prevention medication. I also have an emergency medication that I take when I have bad migraines. my mom only let's me take it when I cry from the pain, or if my dad says something about that medication. she hid it in her room so I couldn't use it when I needed to.

My mom holds off on making appointments for me and me only. Any other sibling can have a sniffle and shes rushing them to the doctor. But I can have a toothache so bad that I won't eat much because im afraid to chew and she will conveniently forget for a month straight. 

She won't go inside grocery stores, she only uses online pickup. And on the order she will, to keep it under a certain price, take off lunch stuff for my siblings and I, to replace it with random junk. Here's an actual list of things: a cotton candy maker, coffee mugs, a curling iron, and candy. My 13yo sibling and I make bets on whether or not there will be something crazy that shes bought this week. I always win as she always gets some kind of junk.

She will also just come up behind me and spank me. like playfully? idk I don't like it and when I tell her that she always says that she made me and pushed me out of her vagina. so my body is hers ig

Keeping my Duolingo streak helps with my depression too. Today is day 607!!! but anytime I show my parents my dad says that they should take my phone away more so I lose my streak.

I don't know if I should move or stay with my toxic family. My ideal college doesn't allow pets on campus unless its a service animal or potentially a emotional support animal and nyx isn't registered as either. and i don't have enough money saved up for college to stay off campus. I also worry about my youngest sibling. im the best with them and I don't know how I feel about leaving them here without me.

A person who is anti-social in reality MAY be more social in VIRTUAL reality, especially of they can use a voice mask. People can come together in VR and undertake tasks and ADVENTURES together. Skyrim TOGETHER REBORN VR! Come on. Is that all we have? MODS we need to learn the LOAD ORDER for and HOW to mod? e_e

VR is multiple things. Both for individuals and groups. I want some chill friends to hang with, to play games with and to make connections with. We disagree politically? Okay... But is that a deal breaker? Those TRULY in power WANT division, so we don't take up opposition against THEM. Are you going to let them divide us like that? Or will you tell them, ""Fuck you!

1q2izdn,https://i.redd.it/3q7pdjq5u1bg1.png,The Weight of Dust - An Old West Tale,"The sun had branded the earth cruel that summer, and Jacob Winters rode through its aftermath like a man traversing the floor of hell itself. Dust rose in columns behind his horse, a gray mare he'd named Patience for reasons that had made sense once, in another life. The town of Redemption Point lay three miles ahead, though he could already smell it: wood smoke, horse dung, the peculiar sweetness of human desperation.

He'd been a lawman for twenty-three years. Long enough to know that justice and the law were distant cousins at best, often strangers. The star in his saddlebag weighed more than the tin it was stamped from. He hadn't pinned it to his chest in four months, not since the thing in Silver Creek that made him understand why some men drank themselves to death while others simply rode away.

Redemption Point materialized through the heat shimmer like something conjured, all false-fronted buildings and crooked ambition. A sign creaked in the hot wind: Salter's Dry Goods. Another: The Lucky Star Saloon. Jacob dismounted at the hitching post outside the sheriff's office, his knees complaining at the familiar ache of too many miles. Patience nickered softly, her trust in him absolute and undeserved.

Sheriff Tom Bevins was younger than Jacob had expected, maybe thirty-five, with the kind of clean-shaven face that suggested he still believed in things. He looked up from his desk as Jacob entered, and something in his eyes changed, the way a man's eyes change when he recognizes the future walking through his door.

""You Winters?"" Bevins asked, though he clearly knew.

""I am.""

""They said you were the best.""

Jacob removed his hat, turned it slowly in his hands. ""They say a lot of things. Most of it's lies dressed up in hope.""

The story came out in pieces, the way these stories always did. A man named Silas Cord had taken up residence in the box canyon north of town. He had four men with him, maybe five, and a girl. Bevins didn't know if she was there by choice or captivity, but she couldn't have been more than seventeen. Cord had killed two men in Nevada, one in California, and had enough warrants on him to paper a small house. He'd made it clear he would burn the town before he'd hang.

""Why me?"" Jacob asked, though he knew the answer.

""Because you're the only one who might walk away from it."" Bevins paused, then added, ""And because you don't care if you don't.""

The truth of it sat between them like a third man in the room. Jacob had seen his own death so many times in dreams and waking visions that it had become an old acquaintance, something expected. Not feared, exactly, but acknowledged the way a man acknowledges winter coming.

He rode out the next morning before dawn, when the world was still merciful with shadow. The canyon was a wound in the earth, red rock walls climbing toward a sky that promised nothing but more heat. He could see the smoke from Cord's camp before he saw the camp itself, and he knew they'd seen him too. Men like Cord always did. They had predator's eyes.

Cord stepped out to meet him, tall and lean with a face like leather left too long in the sun. His hand rested on the pistol at his hip with the casual intimacy of long acquaintance.

""You're a long way from wherever you should be, old man.""

Jacob stayed mounted, keeping his hands visible. ""Come to talk, not shoot.""

""Talk's cheap. I got nothing to buy.""

""The girl,"" Jacob said. ""Let her go, and we can work the rest out.""

Cord smiled, and it was the saddest thing Jacob had seen in a long time, because it was the smile of a man who'd forgotten how to do anything else. ""There's no working things out. Not for me. Not anymore."" He tilted his head toward the canyon walls. ""You see those rocks up there? That's where my boys are sitting with rifles. You so much as twitch, and they'll put enough holes in you to strain coffee.""

Jacob nodded slowly. ""Probably. But that girl didn't choose this. Whatever you are, whatever you've done, she doesn't deserve to pay for it.""

Something flickered across Cord's face, quick as heat lightning. Pain, maybe, or the memory of pain. ""You know what I deserve, lawman? I deserve to be ten years old again, before my daddy beat the hope out of me. I deserve to have never picked up a gun. But we don't get what we deserve. We just get what's coming.""

The silence stretched between them, measured in heartbeats and the distant cry of a hawk.

""Let her go,"" Jacob said again, quieter now. ""Then you and I can settle whatever needs settling.""

Cord studied him for a long moment, and Jacob could see the calculation happening, the measuring of costs and possibilities. Finally, Cord turned his head and called out, ""Mary! Get your things.""

She emerged from the tent like a ghost made solid, thin and pale with wide eyes that had seen too much. She moved past Cord without looking at him, and Jacob wondered what bargains had been struck, what prices paid in this canyon under all these stars.

""Go on,"" Jacob told her, and she took Patience's reins, climbing into the saddle with the desperate grace of the escaping. She rode without looking back, and Jacob was glad for it.

He turned to face Cord, and both men knew how this would end. It was written in the dust, in the heat, in the tired inevitability of men who'd chosen paths that led only here.

""You really the best?"" Cord asked.

""No,"" Jacob said honestly. ""But I'm still here.""

They drew together, two shots that sounded like one, and the canyon swallowed the echoes until there was only silence again. Jacob fell to his knees, then forward, his cheek against earth that tasted of iron and endings. Above him, the sky wheeled in shades of blue he'd somehow never noticed before, and he thought about the weight of stars, the weight of dust, the terrible weight of every choice that brings a man to die in a place whose name he doesn't even know.

But the girl would make it to town. That much was certain. That much would have to be enough.",1,1767408933.0,Western_Freedom,0,1.0,False
1q2iy27,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q2iy27/a_cloud_is_following_me/,A cloud is following me.,"It’s the damnedest thing.

If I hadn’t just watched it happen, I would swear it wasn’t possible. But I just did.

I first noticed things were… off this morning.

There was a dog. It walked through the fog… and then.. Nothing.

No, I don’t mean I couldn’t see it through the fog. I mean the thing never showed back up. I was watching from my porch as the shepherd mix that had been sniffing around the last couple of days walked its way down into the little dip that forms at the foot of the hill we lived on. It wasn’t uncommon for fog to pool down there this time of year, though this year it seemed particularly thick. It was like I was looking at a solid sheet of white. Like the world had just glitched out in that one stretch of road.

But no matter how long I waited, the dog just never showed back up. And this isn’t a big patch of fog—maybe about as wide as a house. The little valley sits lower than the surrounding hills, resulting in a kind of corridor effect. Just enough that when it rains it basically becomes a shallow pond… or a weird cauldron of fog.

I played it off. Figured the dog had just laid down somewhere in that mess for whatever dog reasons it had. After all, why would I dwell on the odd habit of the local mutt when I had a week off to enjoy? Work had died down for the season, and I’d decided on burning through some saved-up vacation time. I told my dad I already had plans when he called. That was easier than explaining why I didn’t want to be near him anymore.

I wasted the morning with coffee and getting mad at my TV screen as kids half my age repeatedly tanked my KDR. It was after about the fifth round of the same kid talking about my mother while teabagging my corpse that I gave up and decided a nice trek would be in order. Sue me—I like my walks, and the mountains make a nice background.

Throwing on my boots and grabbing my pack, I stepped outside. The fog had cleared by then, and the same boring patch of road and rocky terrain was visible. Trekking my way down, I kept my eye open for the pooch, figuring he’d follow me for a while like usual before losing interest, but… he never showed. Not in the entire walk from the rocky shrubland that was my neighborhood to the local forest with that wonderful, almost cinnamon smell coming off the trees.

It was beautiful out.

Only a single cloud in the sky overhead.

I should’ve thought something about it then. Should’ve noticed that cloud had been floating over me since I left my house.

I spent hours just walking, taking in the sights and smells of the woods I’d probably walked a thousand times by now without issue. I made my way up the well-walked path that led to a nice little cliff edge where I could sit and rest.

That’s when I really noticed it.

As I left the woodline, I realized the little rounded cloud I’d seen what must’ve been a mile or so away still seemed to be directly overhead… and maybe even bigger. Was it sitting so low in the sky that my rise in elevation had actually brought me close enough to make it seem that way?

Still, who would pay any attention to that?

I didn’t think anything of it and went ahead to my usual spot under the lone tree, where a large stone just flat enough to act as a stool rested. I sat down and began eating the basic ham-and-cheese sandwich I’d packed. Earbuds in, audiobook playing, I took in the sights until I saw movement.

A deer.

I admit it—I got a little too excited, giddy to see what seemed to be a lone doe cautiously making her way into the clearing, apparently wholly unaware of my presence. After a couple of minutes of watching her munch away at a small bush, I decided spooking her would be worth a laugh.

I put my fingers to my lips and blew hard. The whistle was obnoxiously loud.

I could already feel the laugh building as I saw her body tighten and her head shoot up to look directly at me.

Then nothing.

Well, not nothing. Just… white.

Like a smoke bomb had gone off, the area where the deer had been standing was blanketed in a thick wall of white. The only sound was a muffled fall, like cloth being dropped over your head.

I sat there and watched. Watched the fog.

Fog that slowly rose up from the ground after only a minute or so of having touched down.

Fog does not just drop like that… right?

The deer was gone. That was made clear as the last wispy streaks of white floated slowly up and away. My eyes naturally fell on the treeline, trying to figure out where it had gone, but it was still. Not a single rustled branch, or the normal crashing and rustling of leaves you’d expect from a decent-sized animal fleeing from a predator.

Just quiet.

I slowly got up, confused, and hesitantly approached the patch of grass not twenty feet away where the deer had been.

The grass had been pushed down. Not necessarily crushed, but definitely disturbed.

My foot knocked against something. A small black lump.

I knelt over and picked it up. It had a small white caterpillar on it, with a little fluffy, silk-like attachment on its rear. I gently brushed it off, watching it fall to the ground and start spazzing out, flopping back and forth like a fish out of water. Once it was out of the way, I looked at what I was holding.

The texture was odd. Smooth. Hollow. It felt almost like plastic.

And then it dawned on me.

This was a hoof. Part of one, at least.

I looked back up at the still-rising cloud of white… and saw something float up past my face.

A little white puffball that rose to join the greater whole above me.

A white mass that sat there.

Not moving with the wind. Not billowing or shifting.

Static.

Waiting.

So I ran. Ran into the treeline, down the path. Legs pumping, lungs burning—by God, I ran. I don’t even really remember being scared, just a strong sense of needing to put as much distance between myself and that place as possible.

By the time I’d gotten two-thirds of the way home, my clothes were soaked. I was coughing, taking rough, gasping breaths. And somewhere in there, I found myself laughing. Not hard—just a short, breathless chuckle.

What was I running from? A damn cloud.

I stopped to catch my breath, just for a moment. Leaned against a sign that marked the edge of town. And looked back.

And there it was. Moving calmly, almost imperceptibly. It had to be moving—how else could it still be there? It wasn’t fast. But it was definitely following me.

And that’s where I am now. Sitting in my home, cloud overhead, with not a single damn idea who to call.

Pest control? A priest? The police?

Anybody else have any problems like this before?",8,1767408837.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I apologize in advance for the lengthy post. 

I’m going to refer to the boy as A. A and I are both baristas at different coffee shops in a small city. We met a little over a year ago from going to each others’ shops here and there and I immediately thought he was cute. Earlier last year, a new coffee shop opened in town that we both frequent. We’ve gotten to know each other pretty well I think, because we usually end up talking until one of us has to leave or the shop closes. 

A has an older brother (29M) who I’ll refer to as B. B also frequents this coffee shop, so I’ve gotten to know him pretty well too. B usually shows up before A does and, of course, I want to be on good terms with the whole family, so I make conversation with him. 

Eventually, I couldn’t get A off my mind and I started going to his shop more regularly to see him. I don’t have his number, so the only way I see him is if we both happen to show up at one of the coffee shops. One day, he invited me to a movie with him, his brother B, and some of his friends because his sister got sick and couldn’t go; he offered me the extra ticket. Of course I said yes and went with them, but the whole night ended up feeling like A was trying to set me up with his brother, B. I was DEVASTATED. I like B. He’s a great guy, but he’s a little too old for me and I’ve been interested in A from the start. I don’t know if I ever did anything to B to make him think I was interested, but I doubt it considering that I am absolutely terrible at flirting. 

However, that movie night was a couple months ago and I have only run into B a handful of times since. I didn’t see A much either until recently, and he seems to be even more talkative/interested in making conversation with me. Now I’m confused and I’m wondering if I got so in my head that I made up the whole scenario with A trying to set me up with his older brother, B. Maybe B was just being extra nice to me? Maybe A is completely oblivious and actually had no idea that his brother was flirting? Maybe I made the whole thing up and literally nothing was going on behind the scenes. I don’t know, but I’m scared to bring it up to A. I am terrified of him thinking I’m creepy for showing up to his coffee shop so I stopped. I am terrified of bringing up the movie and making things even more awkward somehow. And I am terrified of being vulnerable and getting my feelings hurt by a guy I never even dated. (Also, because I’m extremely anxious and paranoid about the situation, I am terrified that he will somehow see this post and know everything even though that’s highly unlikely). 

I know this seems so silly and trivial for a 22 year old to be grappling with but I can’t help it. I’ve tried to push it down and it’s not working. Any advice? Should I say something? Admit my feelings? Or just keep hoping that one day he’ll ask me out?",1,1767408764.0,Crush,0,0.99,False

That changed when I started writing little prompts just to make my own life easier with the boring, repeatable stuff I always put off.

Now I use it for things like:

**Planning my week**

    “I work 40 hours, want 3 gym sessions, and have some family stuff on the weekend. Help me build a schedule that’s realistic.”

**Turning notes into to-dos**

    After meetings or voice notes, I just paste the mess in and say: “Clean this up into a task list, prioritize it, and suggest deadlines.”

**Writing awkward messages**

    “Send a friendly but firm message saying I can’t make it to [event]. Keep it short and polite.”

**Quick meal ideas**

    I’ll say: “What can I make this week with eggs, rice, lentils, and spinach?” → it gives me a week’s worth of meals in 10 seconds.

**No more last-minute gifts**

    “Gift ideas for a friend who’s into design, hiking, and coffee. Budget under $60.”

**Actually understanding adult stuff**

    “Explain how taxes work like I’m 12” → better than Googling 12 blog posts.

I’ve saved about 100 of these prompts into a personal collection that covers everyday life, planning, writing, learning, decision-making — all grouped by use case.

1) It doesn't create focus — it restores baseline

After a dose wears off: fog, restlessness,
You feel like  ""I can't start.""
Then you use again and feel ""focused""... because the withdrawal noise shut up.

It's relief, not a transform.

2) You're training a rollercoaster, not steady performance

Nicotine spikes → crash → crave → ""fix.""

Your day: 110% for a bit, 60% later, repeat.

Deep work hates volatility. Every crash breaks flow state—which takes 20+ minutes to rebuild.

3) It hijacks your reward system**

Nicotine gives you the *feeling* of accomplishment without doing the work.

It's the arsonist-firefighter trick: creates the discomfort, then sells you the relief.


The real tax you're paying:

Cognitive switching cost: Every crash = lost flow state

Time cost; 20+ minutes to get back into deep work
Performance cost**: Constant volatility instead of sustained focus


Try this instead (60 seconds):

Next time you think ""I need nicotine to focus"":

1. Name it: ""This is withdrawal, not a real need""
2. Breathe: 3 slow breaths
3. Move: 10 squats / 60-second walk

You're turning your brain back on without paying the tax.

There's a really nice bar (straight bar) near where I live, that I'v never been to in all the years living in my neighborhood. A month ago, I was on the way to the grocery store, and it started to rain and pour. So to escape getting soaked, I ran into this bar. Lo and behold the bartender there was HOT. Completely my type. Super sweet and nice guy. Unfortunately, I was sure he was straight.

However since I work from home, I decided moving forward once a week I would go work from the bar during happy hour there and see the hot bartender. Just out of pleasure because again didn't think he was gay. The interesting thing is every time I ordered my drinks with him, he seemed nervous, shaky around me, like he was maybe intimidated by me?

My sister came to visit me a couple of weeks ago and one day she decided to go to the same bar with her husband. They had a different bartender, but my sister talked to one of the other bartenders, and it came to her attention that most of the staff is gay.

So the next time I went I decided I'd introduce myself to him. Man, he seemed so nervous when he gave me his name, we shook hands, but then we started to talk. When his shift was over he walked up to me, and shook my hand again and told me it was nice to meet me. I also did start to observe that my sister was right, that indeed the staff was mostly gay, lol.

Anyway, I went today, and when I arrived he was super friendly, not nervous anymore, telling me about his NYE, asked me about mine, he mentioned to me where he lived etc. Again his shift ended while I was there and he said goodbye to me. However, after his shift, I was sitting at the bar just finishing some work, and when I turn around because I heard a noise, who do I catch having coffee and by chance starting at me? Him. We locked eyes and he looked away and then left.

1q2inao,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronicfatigue/comments/1q2inao/help_i_need_to_know_if_this_is_fatigue/,Help... I need to know if this is fatigue🙏🏽,"Hello everyone. Before I start I hope you don't mind that english is not my first language. If you need clarifying about any sentence please tell me!

I recently realized I sleep a lot after outings, when I go to my current classes (5 days/week) I end up sleeping 14 hours on friday nights all the time despite having an ok sleep schedule (around six hours on weekdays, can fluctuate but sometimes if i'm too tired I sleep as soon as I get back home, before 8pm). If I don't sleep as much and have free time I end up taking really long naps (can last four to six hours, at some point in mid 2025 six hours was my average nap time for 6 to 8 hours of sleep, I only had one or two appointments a week for job seeking and mental health and nothing else).

It's the new years holidays and I visited a loved one for a week. I also realized I managed to get up from bed when the person was with me or when I felt a sense of urgency (like going to the bathroom, or at least dishes or cooking to do before they come home from work) otherwise it's really hard to get out of bed. Now it's January 3rd and I've been stuck in bed or sat on the floor with no motivation to get up since I got home on the 28th. I feel so frustrated about many things I want to do with free time (clean up, sort through my stuff, do some homework) but I can't get myself out of bed. Or when I try, I realize i can't do it and I go back in bed.

When I go outside I feel fine but it's when I get home that I feel how tired and strained I got. I remember years ago when I worked 27 hours a week at a school (calm job at the library, mostly sitting down), how extremely tired I was when the holidays came up (I would get home, barely eat, sleep immediately, then wake up as late as possible) and sometimes I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up with a full-time job if I'm so tired with a part-time job...

Another example: I have classes next week at 8:30 am but I'm so tired on a daily basis I start oversleeping and I can't keep up a good sleep schedule. It's 3am as I write this and I want to try to sleep but earlier I slept seven hours, woke up at 9am but stayed in bed, only got up at noon to eat something, and took a nap from 3 to 7pm.

(I also feel so frustrated about having to sleep because I feel like this the most energy I've had today is at this time as I write this, so I feel like I'm wasting so much time away by sleeping...)

Does this sound like I could have fatigue or if not, something else? There is probably a problem here but I don't want to jump to conclusions. I can't tell if it's fatigue or something else, or I'm lazy or if I'm not forcing myself enough or what. I drink coffees and energy drinks and they barely even work.

Sorry if that was a mess to read as I don't write on reddit often. I figured you guys would know about fatigue better. I hope you have a peaceful day.🙏🏽",2,1767408047.0,chronicfatigue,0,1.0,False

last month i went out with someone (24m) that i met through a friend. she thought we’d like each other and gave him my ig, he texted me and we talked for a few days before he asked to meet up for coffee and so we did, and i really liked him. our conversation went so well and i came home moderately excited. every date after that i really felt like i could mesh well with him and became more interested in getting to know him, and i knew he was into me too, since in our second date he said he was interested in me

on our next date he told me he was interested in me and wanted to let me know he wouldn’t be seeing or talking to know anyone else, and that he wasn’t looking for something casual, and wanted to know how i felt about that sort of exclusivity while getting to know each other, which i reciprocated 

anyway, this week on our fourth date he told me that he liked me, and that he wanted to do things right and was really interested in pursuing something, and again, i told him i felt the same and expressed concern considering we haven’t known each other for long at all, & he seemed understanding, we talked about physical boundaries and other things, i said i have a hard time with physical affection since it’s not something im used to, as i have little experience in dating. we tried holding hands and by the end of the night we kissed quite a bit, although he made sure to stop often and ask if i felt comfortable 

on NYE he came by my house and we talked and kissed outside. i like kissing but it’s still kinda new to me, i fear i can’t differentiate between making and effort to get out of my comfort zone and letting my anxiety about these things go, vs. a genuine worry that this is pretty much someone i just met, i just don’t know how much closeness is too fast, and normally when people express much interest in me and i feel like they’re too idealized or not genuine, i can shut it down

there’s things i really like about him, his personality and perspective on many topics, his openness and effort to communicate about my feelings and thoughts, and im sooo interested in getting to know him more, he makes me comfortable, but i don’t know if we’re getting too carried away by some kind of giddiness and we’re just high on it. 

i mean, how do you know something is going too fast, if it feels pretty good and we seem compatible? even if, objectively, you don’t really KNOW that person.

I'd be delighted to have the finished manuscript by the end of the month.

Onto my one downside for the day, I woke up with torturous shoulder pain. It woke me up earlier than usual; I suppose that is one good thing to come out of it. As it is, my shoulder was sudden as bad as it had been in October. I tossed and turned for nearly an hour until I could take it anymore. It is still pinching and stinging me now. I have had to take a painkiller just to be able to raise my coffee mug to my mouth this morning. I'll be taking another in a second.

Normally, I get up first, I empty the dishwasher and put whatever didn't in from the night before. I have no problems with this routine.

My partner will make breakfast/get ready for work/leave the house etc. and will leave their coffee cup on the coffee table, or put them in the sink. Not an issue if the dishwasher is full, but often it's not (because I've already emptied it). So I've started leaving her stuff where she's left it.  
  
She's approached me about it said, ""I noticed you didn't put my cup in when you put everything else in, why wouldn't you just put my cup in too."". So IMO, she's aware she's leaving stuff around the house, so my frustration is, if you know you're doing this, why wouldn't you take the extra minute to put in the dishwasher.

We've recently had a fight because we got out the car and she put her mug in the sink and I asked her if she wouldn't mind putting it in the dishwasher. She said ""I brought it in from the car, I had my hands full and the sink was an easier place for me to put it down, why wouldn't you just put in the dishwasher for me?""

Generally, my partner is a supportive person and has lots of green flags. Before we lived together, they had a clean and tidy flat and is very capable of taking care of themselves etc.  

I'm of the opinion we shouldn't be pitting each other against each other, we're a team. However, I feel like this means I have to pick up a bit of extra work, and if she's aware they don't put their dishes away, instead of being open to a discussion, they're defensive. 

TBH, I've found it a bit of trend that spreads to other aspects/parts of the house. If they're cooking breakfast, they'll often leave things they've used on the bench eg. salt and pepper or tongs. And in the bathroom, instead of putting, say, a moisturizer, back in the cupboard she'll leave it out - so if she's used several products, they'll all just sit out the sink. I put them away in her draw, and then she'll ask where I put her things. So I got a plastic basket and put all the stuff she uses everyday on the bathroom sink so she can see them and doesn't have to take extra time to put it away/look for things etc., but is still just leaving them on the sink - think getting a toothbrush out of the holder and putting in on the sink rather than back in the holder.

I have ADHD and autism, so I know how difficult forgetfulness and order and structure are, but I'm just not sure how to fix this problem. I've made some enquires about getting some therapy together, because I'm getting super angry and resentful and we've been together 10 year now, so it's difficult to continue to improve our relationship while we're stuck on these things.

It is fascinating to think that while some people are just waking up to their first coffee of the New Year, others haven't even started their countdown. Because of the way the International Date Line (IDL) zig-zags through the Pacific Ocean, it actually takes **26 hours** for the entire world to enter a new year: [https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/kiribati-welcomes-2026-first-the-surprising-26-hour-time-zone-contradiction-with-baker-islands-final-countdown-to-the-new-year/](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/kiribati-welcomes-2026-first-the-surprising-26-hour-time-zone-contradiction-with-baker-islands-final-countdown-to-the-new-year/)

*Video*: [https://youtu.be/bebGgIBecvQ?si=Ff84Zg6K5bm8-m8i](https://youtu.be/bebGgIBecvQ?si=Ff84Zg6K5bm8-m8i)

Here is the breakdown of who gets there first and who rings it in last:

*The First to Celebrate:* The very first place to welcome the New Year is **Kiribati** (specifically the Line Islands).

* *Kiritimati (Christmas Island):* This island is in the **UTC+14** time zone. Because the country shifted its portion of the Date Line eastward in 1995 to unify its islands, they now ""jump"" into the future ahead of everyone else.
* *The Next in Line:* About 15 minutes later, the **Chatham Islands** (New Zealand) follow, followed an hour later by the rest of New Zealand, Samoa, and Tonga.

*The Last to Celebrate:* The ""end of the line"" is also located in the Pacific, but on the other side of the IDL.

* *The Absolute Last:* The uninhabited U.S. territories of **Baker Island** and **Howland Island** are the final spots on Earth to hit midnight (**UTC-12**).
* *The Last Inhabited Place:* If you’re looking for where people actually live, **American Samoa** and **Niue** are the final inhabited places to ring in the New Year. They are only about 500 miles away from Kiribati but are essentially a full day behind.

*The ""Time Travel"" Trick:* One of the most popular trivia facts about this geographic quirk is that you can technically celebrate New Year’s **twice**. Because **Samoa** (First) and **American Samoa** (Last) are only about a 30-minute flight apart, you can celebrate midnight in Samoa, hop on a plane, and fly ""back in time"" to American Samoa to do it all over again 24 hours later.
