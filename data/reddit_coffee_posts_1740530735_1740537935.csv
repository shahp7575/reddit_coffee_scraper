I found plenty of info online how this is a legit legal requirement for any business playing music.... But it just feels wrong... I know not everyone is paying this fee.. I'm sure the big chains probably do pay it.... I know it's risky to ignore it.... But it's another cost that the customers aren't aware of that is slowly destroying our small independent coffee shop it's so frustrating at a time where we are struggling so much!

Does anyone have any experience with this process. Is it something I can just ignore forever? Or any work around to avoid needing a license? Any help appreciated!

It's what I went to college for and what I wanted to make a career out of. Unfortunately, the industry (especially in California, where I live) has been in dire straights for the longest time, and I've been out of work for 16 months as of posting. I've been trying to do Doordash as a way to bring in a little money (""not enough"" is better than ""none at all"", I say), but I've had multiple dashes the past few weeks with zero hits, so it's no longer a viable income avenue for me.

  
Around town, I see a lot of listings for a lot of service jobs (Starbucks, Target, Ross, Coffee Bean, Chipotle, etc.), and I want to apply to some of them just to have a job and a consistent form of income again. My only problem is that I'm afraid my resume is too stacked with Post-Production jobs to be attractive to any of these places, and the skills I used on the job aren't exactly the most transferable (I don't think a Chipotle shift lead will care that I oversaw a fleet of footage ingestion workstations or that I know how to use DaVinci Resolve), or that I'm too old to be applying to places staffed mainly by people in their teens and early 20s.

I found a good deal on the La Pavoni Mini Cellini, but there‚Äôs barely any info about it online‚Äîanyone know if it‚Äôs solid?

For grinders, it seems like Eureka Mignon models (Perfetto, Turbo, etc.) are a safe bet, but I‚Äôm open to other suggestions.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for in a setup:

‚Ä¢ Fast heat-up time 

‚Ä¢ Shot timer would be nice

‚Ä¢ Good steaming performance (I like milk drinks)

‚Ä¢ Grinder that‚Äôs quiet, time/weight based, not single dose and works well for both espresso and filter coffee

1iyd3d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1iyd3d9/ive_never_been_seen_as_a_romantic_entity/,I‚Äôve never been ‚Äòseen‚Äô as a romantic entity,"The other week I was having drinks with my gal pals and it kinda struck me out of nowhere how none of them would ever date me. It‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs even a thought that goes through my head at all, I love them in a platonic way but it just struck me as something I never really thought about before. 

Have no issues talking to women and making friends but I‚Äôve never really been considered anything more than that. How does one go about sexualizing/romanticizing themselves to make themselves an entity ‚Äòthat ought to be loved‚Äô? It‚Äôs not even like it feels like I‚Äôm stuck in the friend-zone, it feels like I just don‚Äôt have the intrinsic qualities of something that is loveable. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd be rejected because I wouldn‚Äôt even be seen as an option to begin with, y‚Äôknow what I mean? It‚Äôs like the idea of dating your coffee table. The table is nice, good to have around, and super useful. But would you *love* the table? Probably not. 

On one hand it‚Äôs nice knowing that other people feel safe around you / trust you / want you around but the fact I‚Äôve lived my entire life without being seen in a romantic context is starting to eat away at my ego. I don‚Äôt know what it takes to be ‚Äòseen‚Äô in that type of way. 

It‚Äôs isolating to show up to a gathering where everyone brought their partner except for you. I‚Äôm afraid my peers think less of me because of my loneliness, which then makes me feel the need to isolate further. Getting to 21 years old without even getting to a talking stage feels humiliating. The older I get the more it eats away at me because I know how society sees that as a red flag. My biggest fear is my loneliness being seen as some sort of indictment of my character, I don‚Äôt want to be seen as problematic because I‚Äôm alone. But that being said, maybe loneliness *is* an indictment to my character?

Feel like a jerk venting about loneliness in a romantic context when some people here are desperate for any interaction at all, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been eating away at me for a while. Being unlovable is a very isolating feeling, it feels as if everyone else is in on an inside joke you‚Äôre not in on. It doesn‚Äôt feel like theres anything I can do to make myself lovable, it‚Äôs just an inherent aspect of my identity. Just something a person is born with.

jan 24 I decided to visit my friends like from (iloilo to bacolod) from graveyard shift no sleep.

anw my only plan that time is kunin yung parcel ko from our old house sa bacolod kase Ive ordered something from korea na I forgot na dun pala naka address sa bacolod hindi sa updated which is dapat sa iloilo.. so Im planning to just hang out nalang din with my 1 girl friend(rose) na from bacolod din para sulit din naman gala ko

but my friend rose asked me if we can invite our guy friend(jet) to have coffee with us so I just said yes para atleast we have someone na talkative

forward sa cafe shop jet and I are very close before jet and rose become close (anyway rose have feelings with jet and he knows it lol) then jet out of sudden mention our other girl friend(dianne) just told me na dont post anything sa story ko sa ig so dianne wont see it, but Im the person who dont mind it

so I chat dianne and told her that I am with jet and rose and that time I didnt know pero the format ng chat ko sa kanya is ""hagad ya kami kape""(inaya nya kami mag coffee)
I really dont know pero I didnt mind this message kase sabi lang ni dianne sa chat with me is just ""ok enjoy""

me and jet and dianne are the original trio like we are always together before we separated our path because me and dianne decided to grab higher opportunities with different company so only jet lang ang naiwan sa old company namin, but even before they always hang out together na sila lang dalawa like jet and dianne lang and I dont mind because I am married with kids and working mom so its really hard sometimes to join them, so I dont really mind them hanging out just two of them 

so eto na nga dianne message me just out nowhere with ""I thought jet is the one who asked you to have coffee with him?""
I was like.. huh? then I remember maybe she is talking about that day na we had coffee pero kase its like a month ago na so like out of the blue?
pero as what Ive said Im not the person na dont care and dont plan to explain anything
then she send a new message again saying
""I dont get it why you have to lie that jet is the one who asked you to have coffee when you're the one who asked him?""
lol how did I lie?? I get it mali ko na I send her a message that day na saying jet is the one who asked us, but HOW CAN SHE LIKE HOW COULD SHE TELL ME NA I LIED TO HER! its not even intentional or mean to tell her that, pero my point is whats with her na kailangan nya mag sabi na I lied and why do I need to explain when I dont even mind them going out before without me????? she is just friend? it's clearly obvious that she is being jealous!

1iyd1kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1iyd1kv/why_does_the_breville_bambino_espresso_machine/,Why does the Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS deliver exceptional quality? A detailed review of this compact espresso maker,"The Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS has been my go-to for brewing espresso at home for the past few weeks. As someone who enjoys experimenting with coffee, this compact machine has impressed me in many ways while also exposing a few areas for improvement. Designed for coffee enthusiasts who crave barista-quality results, the Bambino promises a lot‚Äîand it mostly delivers.

**Design & Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the Bambino exudes elegance. Its brushed stainless steel exterior gives it a sleek and modern look, fitting seamlessly into my kitchen setup. Measuring just 13.7"" in depth and 6.3"" in width, it takes up very little counter space. This compact size is a blessing for small kitchens or apartments. However, I noticed that some of the components, like the tamper, feel a bit lightweight, almost bordering on flimsy. Despite this, the machine remains sturdy and well-constructed.

**Features**

This espresso maker is loaded with features that cater to both beginners and seasoned coffee lovers. The automatic steam wand, for instance, is a standout. It allows you to adjust the milk temperature and texture, making it easier to create microfoam for latte art. The low-pressure pre-infusion ensures even extraction, while the digital temperature control (PID) maintains the optimal brewing temperature. One feature I found particularly exciting is the thermojet technology, which heats up the machine in just three seconds. Gone are the days of waiting for your coffee maker to warm up!

[Check Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0b1jppg2l/)

**Brewing Performance**

The Bambino is a powerhouse when it comes to brewing espresso. I experimented with both single and double shots, and the results were consistently robust and flavorful. The 54mm portafilter ensures full-bodied espresso, a feature I really appreciated during my taste tests. However, the lack of a built-in grinder means you‚Äôll need to invest in a separate one, which adds to the cost and counter space requirements.

**Coffee Quality**

The quality of coffee produced is stellar. I tried various beans and grind sizes, and while it took a bit of trial and error to get the perfect shot, the Bambino consistently delivered rich, aromatic espresso. The digital temperature control played a huge role in maintaining consistency, which is vital for achieving that perfect cup.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

Milk frothing is where the Bambino truly shines. The steam wand is automatic yet customizable, allowing you to adjust the milk‚Äôs texture to your liking. I managed to create smooth microfoam that enhanced my lattes and cappuccinos. The wand‚Äôs power is surprisingly strong for such a small machine, making it a joy to use. My niece even tried her hand at frothing milk and was thrilled to successfully make her first latte art!

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The water tank, while compact, holds a decent amount of water for multiple shots. Positioned at the back, it‚Äôs detachable and easy to refill. However, its location can be a bit inconvenient if the machine is placed under low-hanging cabinets, as you‚Äôll need to pull it out to access the tank.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

One of my favorite aspects of the Bambino is its user-friendly cleaning process. The drip tray and portafilter are easy to remove and wash. The machine also features an automatic cleaning cycle, which can be activated with the press of a button. However, the small drip tray fills up quickly, requiring frequent emptying‚Äîa minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

Thanks to the thermojet heating system, the Bambino is incredibly energy-efficient. It heats up in mere seconds and powers down automatically when not in use. As for noise, it‚Äôs quieter than many other espresso machines I‚Äôve used, which is a bonus for early mornings when the rest of the household is still asleep.

**Warranty & Support**

Breville offers a one-year limited warranty for the Bambino. While I haven‚Äôt had to contact customer support yet, the warranty provides some peace of mind. The included interactive setup guide through the Tilt app was also a helpful touch during the initial setup.

**Advantages**

* Heats up in just three seconds, saving time in the mornings.
* Compact size makes it ideal for small kitchens.
* Automatic steam wand simplifies milk frothing for beginners.
* Consistently produces rich, full-bodied espresso.
* Easy-to-use controls and quick cleaning process.

**Shortcomings**

* No built-in grinder, requiring a separate purchase.
* Some parts feel less durable, like the included tamper.
* Small drip tray needs frequent emptying.

**Competing Products**

When comparing the Breville Bambino to other espresso machines in its category, a few alternatives come to mind. The De'Longhi Dedica is another compact option with a similar price range, but it lacks the advanced milk frothing capabilities of the Bambino. On the higher end, the Gaggia Classic Pro offers more robust construction and manual control but takes up more space and lacks the Bambino‚Äôs rapid heat-up feature. If you value quick setup and ease of use, the Bambino is a clear winner.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its features and performance, the Breville Bambino offers excellent value for its price. It bridges the gap between entry-level and professional espresso machines, making it a worthwhile investment for coffee enthusiasts. While the absence of a built-in grinder is a drawback, the overall quality and convenience justify its cost.

1iyd049,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1iyd049/can_waterdrop_wdg2w_reverse_osmosis_system_really/,Can Waterdrop WD-G2-W reverse osmosis system really transform your water quality? A detailed review for those considering this tankless water filtration system,"Testing the Waterdrop WD-G2-W reverse osmosis system in my own home has been an enlightening experience. With its innovative tankless design and advanced filtration technology, this under-sink water filtration system boasts compact efficiency and promises to deliver cleaner, purer water. My expectations were high, but I was also curious about any potential drawbacks. Here's my take after using it extensively.

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

The composite filtration system in the Waterdrop WD-G2-W is quite impressive. It combines multiple layers to target a wide range of contaminants, including TDS (total dissolved solids), PFAS, PFOA, PFOS, and more. I tested the water quality using a TDS meter, and the results were consistently around 10-15 ppm, down from my city water's 140 ppm. That‚Äôs a dramatic improvement! The water tastes crisp, clean, and honestly, better than bottled water. Knowing that harmful chemicals and heavy metals are significantly reduced gives peace of mind, especially when preparing food or making beverages.

**Ease of Installation & Use**

Installing the Waterdrop WD-G2-W was surprisingly straightforward. I‚Äôm not a professional plumber, but the instructions were clear, and the connections fit securely. The twist-and-pull design for replacing filters is a blessing‚Äîno wrestling with tight cartridges! However, you will need an electrical outlet under your sink, which might require some adjustments in older homes.

One hiccup I encountered was drilling a hole in the countertop for the faucet. If you don‚Äôt already have a pre-drilled hole, this might be a task for a professional. Luckily, my countertop had a spare hole from an old soap dispenser. The process of replacing filters is quick and mess-free, taking less than five minutes.

[View Waterdrop WD-G2-W sale info on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b082cz9xz9/)

**Flow Rate & Performance**

The Waterdrop WD-G2-W delivers a flow rate of 0.28 gallons per minute, which means you can fill a glass in about 12 seconds. While this may not sound lightning-fast, it‚Äôs definitely an upgrade from my old tank-based RO system that required pre-filling a tank. However, there is a slight delay before the water reaches its optimal purity if the system has been idle. A small trade-off for the tankless design, but something to keep in mind.

**Capacity & Suitability**

With a daily capacity of 400 gallons, the unit is suitable for families or households that consume a lot of drinking water. It‚Äôs also a great choice for avid cooks or coffee enthusiasts like myself. Instead of constantly buying and storing bottled water, this system provides a continuous supply of filtered water right at your sink.

**Features**

One standout feature is the tankless design. Not only does it save a significant amount of under-sink space, but it also eliminates the risk of bacterial growth that can occur in traditional RO tanks. The compact design fits snugly under my sink, leaving room for cleaning supplies. The system also boasts a 1:1 pure-to-drain ratio, which is more efficient than many competitors that waste up to three gallons for every gallon filtered.

Another feature I appreciated is the quiet operation. Although the initial filtration process produces a soft hum, it‚Äôs not intrusive. My previous system sounded like a small jet engine, so this was a welcome change.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

The filters in the Waterdrop WD-G2-W have a lifespan of 12 months, depending on usage and water quality. While the replacement filters are a bit pricey, the convenience and performance make up for it. Plus, the system provides a reminder when it‚Äôs time to change the filters, so there‚Äôs no second-guessing.

**Certifications**

The Waterdrop WD-G2-W is FCC listed, which underscores its safety and reliability. It‚Äôs reassuring to know the materials used are lead-free and meet strict quality standards. For those concerned about health and safety, these certifications are a significant bonus.

**Warranty**

The product comes with a one-year warranty, which is standard for most filtration systems. I haven‚Äôt had to use customer service yet, but other reviews suggest that Waterdrop is responsive and accommodating.

**Good Points**

* Compact, tankless design saves under-sink space.
* Excellent water quality with reduced TDS and contaminants.
* Easy installation and quick filter replacement.
* Quiet operation with eco-friendly water-saving features.

**Areas for Improvement**

* Water takes a moment to reach optimal purity after being idle.
* Requires an electrical outlet under the sink.
* Replacement filters are on the expensive side.

**Alternative Offerings**

Comparing the Waterdrop WD-G2-W to similar systems like the APEC ROES-PH75 or the iSpring RCC7, the tankless design is a game-changer. Traditional systems with tanks are bulkier and prone to bacterial growth, which the Waterdrop avoids entirely. While the APEC system includes a remineralization filter for adding healthy minerals back into the water, the Waterdrop focuses on pure filtration. If you‚Äôre short on space or prefer a modern, streamlined design, the Waterdrop system outshines its competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**

While the initial investment might seem steep, the system‚Äôs efficiency and long-term savings on bottled water make it worth every penny. The 1:1 pure-to-drain ratio ensures minimal water waste, which is not only cost-effective but also eco-friendly. Given the durability and performance, this system offers excellent value for the price.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I had been having issues with very inconsistent brewing. Grind and quantity adjustments were helping little to correct the inconsistent brewing and we always use fresh beans, maintainn the infuser o-rings, etc. Ultimately replaced the infuser and brew consistency immediately improved.  
Now about a year later I see the same exact spot on the infuser is broken. Coffee quality has gotten inconsistent; watery pucks, machine sometimes locks-up as if insufficient pressure to brew. **Any ideas as to why this collar is breaking off the infuser twice?**

The transmission assembly seems to be a bit loose, but not sure how tights it sits in the machine. I don't see any obvious issues of wear in the track and it's hard to inspect the transmission much even with the machine opened. Wondering if some misalignment with the transmission could be creating this issue with breaking the infuser?

1iyctar,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1iyctar/my_work_colleague_has_bpd_and_i_love_her_what/,My work colleague has BPD and I love her. What should I do?,"Hi everyone!  I wanted to start by saying I do not have BPD, but I understand it well since I was in a three year relationship with someone who had it over 10 years ago.  This is going to be a long post, so I apologize in advance, but it is necessary for me to tell the whole story in order to get proper advice.  Let's begin.

I work for a large company in public relations.  I've worked at this company now for 7 years and it's a great job.  About 3 years ago, this lovely woman (who I'll refer to as ""The Colleague"") began working in the office down the hall.  She seemed shy, didn't talk to most people at work, but was an incredibly creative problem solver.

On one of her projects, she made some mistakes and another coworker made some negative comments toward her.  That day when I entered the break room, I found her crying over her lunch.  She explained to me what had happened and she thought everyone at work hated her.  I told her she is wonderfully creative,  does an excellent job, and it's okay to make mistakes.    She cried more, but thanked me for my kind words.

Over the next few months, she would regularly go out of her way to see me.  She'd come into my office to talk.  She kept asking if we could be friends.  I didn't agree right away because at the time, I was dating someone who had strong negative feelings toward the idea of me having female friends.  Eventually, that relationship didn't work out and my girlfriend broke up with me.  After many months of The Colleague being persistent, I agreed to be her friend.  She gave me a hug.  

Over the next few weeks, she kept asking me if we could meet outside of work.  I was lonely and didn't mind the friendly companionship, so I agreed to meet her at a coffee shop.  There, we talked for over four hours.  It was almost like we were old childhood friends, but this was the first time I was getting to know her.

We talked constantly after that at work.  She came into my office more frequently, and we'd often share our interests with one another.  It was like she loved everything that I loved.  A few weeks later, I asked her if she'd like to go to a carnival with me.  She gave me a really big hug and said, ""YES!"".  She seemed very excited about it.

We had an amazing time together at the carnival.  We are funnel cakes, played games, and watched the circus performers do flips.  It was so much fun!  We talked about her hobbies, pottery she was making, and her love of music.  She even bought a milkshake for me.  It was very kind.  At the end of the night, I walked her back to her car, she gave me another huge hug, and that's when something confusing happened for me.

She looked me straight in the eye and said, ""Please keep being my friend.  You are the best friend I've ever had"".

The reason this confuses me was that I had no intention of dissolving this friendship.  I wasn't sure why she needed that reassurance, at least at the time.

Things continued to be good between us at work, but began getting a little flirty on her end.  She would casually brush up against me a lot, tell me dirty jokes and then punch me in the arm when I laughed, and send me pictures of erotic memes.  She began texting me non-stop.  I'd always respond, but sometimes I was in a meeting and couldn't respond quickly.  She approached me one day after one of these meetings and told me it annoyed her that I was too busy to respond.  I apologized, but explained that I had no choice while in a meeting.  She stopped talking to me for a few days.  I still really liked her and couldn't understand why she would stop talking to me when before, she was so excited to be around me all the time.

Eventually, she started following me in the office again.  One day, she pulled me into a break room, gave me a giant hug, and invited me to dinner at a delicious Japanese restaurant.  Since our last two outings were great, I agreed to go.  It was wonderful.  We had the most intimate conversations over dinner.  We talked about past relationships and why they failed.  We talked about love.  We talked about sex.  We talked about life lessons we've learned and dreams we wanted to accomplish.  It was more intimate than any conversation I've ever had in any relationship I had ever been in and this wasn't even an official date.  We were just a couple of friends out for a nice dinner together.

After the meal, we went for a walk through the city.  We saw the harbor lights and talked about being lost in their beautiful glow.  At that moment, she looked at me with the most dreamy stare and went in for the longest hug I had ever experienced.  It lasted at least five minutes, but seemed like and eternity.  

During the hug, she said, ""Please promise you'll never leave me.  Everyone leaves me.  I think you're different, but I'm afraid.""

I don't know why I felt the feelings that I felt in that moment, but my heart couldn't say no.  She then looked at me like she wanted me to kiss her.  Normally, I wouldn't have thought twice, but this was not a date.  It was something else.  At that time, I wasn't sure what, but I knew I was feeling things toward her that I've never felt before.  The beginning of what I thought was a true twin-flame.

The next day at work, it was difficult to focus.  I couldn't stop thinking about how strangely surreal the night before was.  I was weighing a lot of thoughts surrounding what I should do.  Should I ask her out?  Will it be weird because we are work colleagues?  Is she feeling the same things I'm feeling?  After work that day, we walked out to the parking lot together.  She was flirting with me the whole way.  I thought that if she is flirting, she must want to go out on an official date!

I made the decision to ask her out properly.  Her reaction was visceral!  There was fear in her eyes.

She said in a terribly frightened voice, ""No!  Not you!""

I told her I thought we had chemistry and that we connected on a deeply personal level.  She slapped me and told me very angrily that she couldn't be in a relationship and that everything she touches get ruined.  She said she didn't want to ruin me too.

After that, she became very distant.  She avoided talking to me, stopped responding to my texts, and no longer invited me out.  She went an entire month of no contact with me.  I was so confused.  I really thought there was something there.  However, I made a promise.  I promised I would be there for her, so I didn't give up.  The more I pushed in, the more she pulled away.  Eventually, she told me in a way I could understand that being there for her meant that she needed to pull away.  I backed off, but just sent occasional reminders that I still cared.

Months later, things seem to have normalized.  We still talk at work, but not much more beyond that.  The  intermittent flirty exchanges still sometimes happen and I think and hope she still knows how I feel.  She would sometimes compare me to other friends in my presence.  I understand now that she does this not because she wants to make me feel bad, but because she doesn't want to lose me.  It's a test to see if I'll stay.  

During all this time gone by, I put the puzzle pieces together.  I understand more than the average person about BPD, but I need some perspective from others that know it first hand.  What should I do?  I really do care about her.  She is amazing in so many ways.  I know she feels terrible inside.  I know she is hurting.  I would hug her in the dark and tell her everything going to be okay if it could heal her pain even for a moment.  Should I give her time?  Should I ask her out again?  I will never know if she is truly my twin-flame unless I try.  I'm willing to try.",1,1740536469.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False
1iycsn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/1iycsn2/recently_diagnosed_hsv2/,Recently diagnosed HSV-2,"38yr old male, recently diagnosed with HSV-2 officially 48 days ago (Jan 7) but have been having symptoms since a week after my first Initial encounter with the person I suspect passed the infection on to me, which has been on-going since 103 days ago (Dec 12)

I‚Äôve been tested for chlamedia/ gonorrhoea, and had my blood work pulled for pretty much everything you can think of which is when they found the HSV-2 igg. (That‚Äôs literally all the info they gave me)

My symptoms from the beginning have been extreme itching in the genitalia area, and severe burning in the shaft of my junk. But no outbreaks or anything has occurred this whole time. Truthfully I woulda suspected it to be chlamedia‚Ä¶

So I have been only experiencing extreme itching and a general feeling of discomfort 24/7.
It‚Äôs amazing how little the doctors understand this infection, so I am completely stumped. It‚Äôs making me begin to wonder if:
1. I‚Äôve had this already in my system for a very long time and just didn‚Äôt no, looking back thru life there a little signs here and there, but impossible to know.
2. Maybe I have something else going on?

Prior to learning I was HSV-2 positive from the bloodwork the hospital took, I ran 3 long rounds of antibiotics for chlamedia and ghonorrhea, and thought maaaaybe I built an immunity to them and that‚Äôs why my results were coming back negative, but who knows and maybe the treatment just wasn‚Äôt working to kill the STI.

Now I‚Äôm in a constant state of itching around the testicals, and penis shaft with a weird on/off burning inside the head of the penis this is driving me absolutely nuts. The itching is what is killing me the worst. It just doesn‚Äôt go away. Sometimes when I sleep it will turn off for a but usually wakes me in the night badly. It‚Äôs not until I wake up and have a coffee and get active and go to the gym that it reignites and gets overwhelming again for the day.

And I have a tight feeling in between my thighs (inside legs) on either side of my gentials but in my legs that are always feeling tight like an infection (which I‚Äôm sure it is) the doctor originally reported when he first suspected I had this that my lymph nodes on either side of my gentials were swollen which is another common sign he told me‚Ä¶

Has anyone other guys out there experienced any of this? Again- NO outbreaks but seems like non-stops side effects. I don‚Äôt see much guys talking on here‚Ä¶

I also did a 10 day run of Valacyclovir (4 pills/ twice daily) at the very start of being diagnosed on Jan 7th 2025, and am now on a permanent dose of x2 Valacyclovir daily for life just to be careful. Doesn‚Äôt seem to really help or do anything.

I also took that L-lysine stuff at first for a few weeks too. But didn‚Äôt really get any results either.

Any input helps as I‚Äôm completely lost‚Ä¶",1,1740536413.0,Herpes,1,1.0,False

I used to go on long hikes, golf, ski, etc. I had two healthy pregnancies and worked as a bedside nurse up until a week before giving birth without an issue. When I was pregnant with my second, I hiked with my first on my back. I am a bedside med-surg nurse and I never had a problem working 4 (12-hour) shifts in a row! And then I would go golfing after my 4th shift. I would commonly work overtime and spent my days off being active. Nothing ever stopped me before now! 


A year and a half ago I had horrible pelvic pain that sent me to the ER (I‚Äôm not one to go to an ER for anything but I couldn‚Äôt walk.) ER did a pelvic ultrasound to make sure my mirena IUD was in place- it was- and a UA. Everything negative. I followed up with my GYN who did swabs, again negative, and they told me everything was fine. Pain went away so I just kept going. I‚Äôm not sure if this incident has anything to do with my current symptoms but they became noticeable shortly after. 

It all started with this low-grade exhaustion. I would need more coffee to get through my day. The exhaustion started getting worse slowly. Over the summer, I had difficulty driving long distances and needed several cups of coffee to get through one shift. I was exhausted after 2 shifts in a row and could no longer do overtime. Over the summer we went on a family vacation, I had a difficult time driving the long distance, a trip I have made several times alone before. By the end of the summer, I was having a difficult time just doing basic things (shaving, doing my nails and hair, tidying the house, etc.) but figured it was just stress and a lack of sleep. 


In the fall, more symptoms started becoming noticeable. Numbness and tingling of my hands, especially when I held them up to type or drive. They would also turn pale or blue at times. Hair loss- I got a large bald spot on the front of my head. My nails were brittle and started breaking. Lightheadedness especially when I would bend down to pick something up. Shortness of breath on exertion at times. I went to a doctor who ran basic urine and blood tests. All negative except low vitamin D. She told me I was just depressed and didn‚Äôt run anything else. 


I started taking a vitamin D supplement that helped for a few weeks but now the symptoms are worse than ever! I can barely get through the day. I spend most days on the couch. If I eat something fatty, I feel like I‚Äôm drugged for over 24 hours I can barely open my eyes or stand up. It‚Äôs hard for me to stand up even long enough to wash my hair. I am so exhausted all the time! I need caffeine pills, supplements and healthy foods just to stay awake. Forget about doing anything productive! I feel like I can‚Äôt even watch my kids at this point. My fianc√© is sacrificing his business to do all the cooking, cleaning and childcare right now but this can‚Äôt continue for much longer. After I work 2 days in a row I‚Äôm bedbound the next day. 


Over the last couple of weeks my symptoms started to scare me with the addition of incontinence- both bowel and bladder. I don‚Äôt even feel like I have to go or notice that I went. It happened maybe 6 times in the last month. My migraines are also getting worse. I ate one bad meal and slept for most of the next day. I looked like I took Benadryl- that‚Äôs how zonked out I was from that one meal (a burger and fries.) 


I found a new doctor that wants me to do a sleep study and autoimmune tests (haven‚Äôt went to the lab yet but will soon.) I just want someone to point me in the right direction. What kind of specialist should I see? What kind of tests should I have done? What supplements should I take to get through the day while I wait for tests? Any idea of what this could be?

Grace was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 26 birthday growing up in a small town with a big city feel to her. But to Grace it was her home but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that she would ride her bike through towns streets. 

Weaving in and out of cars passing by them feeling free from the world around her feeling the wind blowing wildly through her long brown hair. Racing as the excitement showed in her smile saying it all. Making her through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed by.

With Grace having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement mainly it was just them watching out for her own safety. Grace was just your typical young green eyed girl who liked her shredded jeans tee shirt and hoodie living her life her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Grace being the girl that she was never backing down from a challenge, found herself racing through the streets along with one or two others.

Not to say that one didn‚Äôt catch her eye from time to time his name was Hector‚Äô Hector was a guy that charm on a dime. Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match especially on a bike.

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Grace‚Äô whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them.

Knowing that Grace a well to do girl, finding himself with Grace leaving him with a glance and a smile as Grace left him looking. 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‚ÄòQuicksilver‚Äô riding her bike faster and farther each day.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Grace needed it be. For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go forever dodging in and out of front of cars. As always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Grace was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life. More then often finding herself thinking about her life For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life  it felt as if she was living someone else‚Äôs life other then her own. 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. Often finding herself dreaming of a life being on her own making her  own way in life on her bike.

Often finding herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Grace found herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Grace for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget.

To relax, to think about her life thinking about her life growing up for she didn‚Äôt have any family or many friends. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself competing against if not in the city streets or here on one of the many trails. Grace found that life for her was there in the mountains with her bike outside of her hometown. But as the day grew long with Grace setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Grace loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else‚Äôs. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

‚ÄúIf I am not me then who am I ‚Äú

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Grace was never in the town that she grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Grace rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Grace that was her Life on her bike loose and fast racing with the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it‚Äôs many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby‚Äôs of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Grace herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn‚Äôt wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Grace had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Grace and Hector to a race, but not just any race a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Grace and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. 

 just laying there losing their selves in the moment laying there up under a star lit sky. 
But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Grace and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Grace trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Grace then stopping to check as Hector then motioned to her saying to her

‚ÄúGo! Go get ‚Äòem Grace! You got this!‚Äù

And with that it wasn‚Äôt too long before Grace had caught up to them, for Grace knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Grace then a hard look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Grace had won the race.

Later that evening Grace and Hector would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Grace just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector then saying goodbye to Grace as he then headed back to town leaving Grace there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Grace then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Grace had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Grace began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? For as far back Grace could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Grace set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Grace laid there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. laying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. The same dream the same dream that Grace had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Grace would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she lived From the town that she lived in. But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone called her Chloe. 

Suddenly waking up to the morning‚Äôs light putting her hands up to her head Grace just set there stunned. Thinking to herself on how real that dream was for unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! Still visibly shaken as Grace looked around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Grace began to scream a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 ‚ÄúHello Grace it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you‚Äù 

With a feeling of relief coming over Grace, Grace then replied with 

‚ÄúThen why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI know all about you Grace, I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek‚Äù 

With Grace then replying 

‚ÄúAnswers to what? What answers do I seek‚Äù 

‚Äú Dreams, Grace your dreams.‚Äù 

As Grace just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Grace just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

‚ÄúIt is you Grace and it is not you‚Äù

More confused then ever Grace just replied by saying 

‚ÄúMe! How‚Äù 

Just as the man then slowly approached Grace standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

‚Äú In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut now in this Life you are her and she is and you are not. For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life‚Äù 

with Grace then replying 

‚ÄúIs this Heaven then and are you an Angel?‚Äù 

With a smile the man just simply said 

‚Äú I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Grace! And this is your Life the Life that you ask for‚Äù 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Grace

 ‚ÄúThe dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFor do not look at what was then, just look at what is now and what is to come for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!‚Äù

‚ÄúNow go and Live your Life Grace for Life is what has been granted to you‚Äù 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Grace. Standing there looking out over Angels Ravine Grace couldn‚Äôt help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then memories of her dreams of the girl was now fading slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come a Life of whatever was to come for Grace. 

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now it was her town her home her Life. With Grace now leaving Angels Ravine making her way home finding her usual self racing to beat her own best time.

Grace finding herself making her way through once more through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was going to ride into Life into her Life Living a Life of what she made it.

TLDR - Over the last month I‚Äôve had multiple conversations with my bf expressing my frustration with things he does that feel disrespectful/inattentive to me. Then on Saturday he blows up on me saying I‚Äôve been neglecting him/not showing enough affection over the last few weeks. Is this manipulation? How can I be expected to be affectionate when I‚Äôve been trying to explain to him why I‚Äôm struggling to be?

‚Äî-

Over the last month there were a few conversations where I shared my frustration over a lack of date nights and that he often ignores me for his phone or video games. I feel disrespected and it‚Äôs been hard to show the same level of affection and enthusiasm for my relationship. 

The last few days things have gotten kinda dark. Friday night was good with him, but I fell asleep on the couch and woke up to him rage cleaning. I keep the place pretty clean so I thought he was just mad that things weren‚Äôt as tidy as usual. He insisted nothing was wrong but couldn‚Äôt even look at me. It was so tense that I got so much physical anxiety that I had to leave and get a coffee until he left. 

Later, he comes home from his workout in a great mood and acts like nothing happened earlier. We get groceries and things were normal for a few hours. I end up asking him, ‚Äúhey this morning seemed like something was up, I wanted to check in if you wanted to talk about anything?‚Äù And he immediately gets mad, and admits that he was mad/annoyed with me earlier. 

He said  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say, I don‚Äôt want to talk about it, it‚Äôll just make things worse‚Äù. Then he went to bedroom and wouldn‚Äôt talk to me. There was so much tension again that I went back to my car and sat there for 2 hours before he left again. Later that night, he calls me while he‚Äôs with friends and is being overly nice and giving me all these compliments. It feels like he‚Äôs playing a game with me. 

The next day, he comes home and sits at his desk huffing and puffing with his head in his hands at his desk. I didn‚Äôt say anything because it felt so passive aggressive. He ends up admitting that he is mad at me because I fell asleep on the couch and I haven‚Äôt been affectionate enough to him in the last few weeks. Even though I came to him multiple times to explain he‚Äôs doing things that are making it harder for me to be affectionate. 

Wtf y‚Äôall. Today he‚Äôs acting like everything is sunshine and roses but I am still uncomfortable about everything and can‚Äôt just flip a switch that everything is ok. I told him that his refusal to communicate with me and not telling me what was wrong for multiple days felt manipulative.

Am I cooked?,"Obligatory long time lurker, first time poster. Sorry for any spelling or grammar errors, im emotional and numb all at once.

Feb 2024 I met my boyfriend (29M) on a dating app. We clicked andunderstood each other on a very deep level and made it official 1 month later.

When we first met, he did not have a job but was looking in his field. He had been looking for 6 months prior but said that having a full time job he hates will ""kill his soul"".
I had a full time job paying me 4k. When we got together, I took on an extra part time job for $16/hr for 3 days a week so that I could spend more on him.

April 2024 the place I was working at closed down, but I still had a part time job. He was still at status quo.

End May 2024, I stopped working and decided to take a break to evaluate my career choices. I also started making content on tiktok and it was taking off. I have begun a home business to try my hand at entrepreneurship. He was still at status quo.

At this point after 3 months of dating, I had a breakdown and asked him to please start paying for my meals. We have always had simple cheap meals but he insists that a girl expecting a free meal is a red flag. I told him I have begun to avoid meal times with him and I do not feel his affections because of this. He obliged and was sincerely apologetic that he made me uspet.

August 2024, Both of us were in a bad living situation and decided to move out and get an apartment together. 

At this point his savings are nearly drained but I still have a substantial amount. I have periodically paid for his protein powder or in game purchases because gifts are my primary love language.

September 2024, I ditched my home business and set out to find a full time job to pay for rent and living expenses. At the same time, he delved deeper into business and was trying to help a friend's marketing agency take off with his expertise.

December 2024, I am pulling an income of 3k a month and he is bringing home nothing. The business partner he is working with has convinced him to trust the process and reinvest in the business.
I periodically give him a bit of money and make sure his meals are taken care of.

I tell him he needs to start bringing in money. It has been 3 months since we moved in together and he is not contributing. In the past 3 months I also had several breakdowns over him not doing chores, then doing chores poorly, then not doing chores regularly. 

Each time I have to communicate to him exactly how and what needs to be done and I spell out my mental load and how it is drastically skewed on my end. He lacks initiative but is understanding and changes his behaviours for the better, but only after I have had a breakdown each time.

End December 2024, financially, nothing has changed since we first met other than both our savings being completely drained. I am struggling to keep us and out 2 cats afloat and have resorted to drinking coffee and eating biscuits as a meal to save money. 

On the side I am still selling cakes and pastries but i send the money to my boyfriend because I'm worried about what he does for his meals.

January 2025, my boyfriend got his friend (27M) to move into the extra room, paying $800 a month. While it is a relief that rent is being supplemented, I have gotten paid a bit more at work and tell my bf to take the $800 for his food/gym/business plans.

Feb 2025, my boyfriend has a falling out with his business partner. He has worked for free for 4 months with nothing to show for it. I essentially told him to choose between me or this terrible ""business partner"". He walks away from him and starts posting content which brings him revenue.
He asks me for $600 to work on his side business which has substantially more potential and is already making profit. I give it to him.

On my end I found a job that would pay be 62% more than my current place. With budgeting I can now breathe a little better. I am still paying for everything.

End Feb 2025, yesterday, I found a part time job near our place paying me $10/hr. I can work on the weekends after my new job. With this i can finally save $1000 a month.

Financially there is still nothing from him.
I don't know what kind of money he is making (he takes on projects on a free lance basis), i dont know when the money is coming in, where it is going. I know nothing of his plans, career and financial-wise. He does not have initiative in offering up information. I have to ask him specific questions or have breakdowns for him to realise that I need a lot more from him.

Yesterday I finally drew very clear boundaries:

1. Your friend's $800 rental money will be going to me.

2. Whatever money I make will go into rent, the cats, and myself. You are no longer part of the equation.

3. You are to log every cent of your income and expense on a spreadsheet for me to get reassurance.

4. I will still buy groceries when we are running low but I will no longer make food for you.

5. If we do go out to eat, we will pay for ourselves. Otherwise we will settle our own meals (he can eat 3 times of what I do).

6. I expect you to do most of the chores around the house in lieu of rent.

7. This is no longer ""our"" place. This is my place and you're living here rent free and I will treat you as my boyfriend who is simply visiting me everyday.

8. When you are financially stable and can contribute to the rent, we will re evaluate boundaries.

TLDR; im tired of mothering my boyfriend. I am still trying to work out this relationship so please don't tell me to break up. Chat, am i cooked?

I just recently met a girl from a dating app. We have gone on a few dates so far and IMMEDIATELY gained a strong connection.

We both have been single for a few years, and firstly went on a very laid back coffee date that led too closing down the shop and eventually sleeping with each other that night. 
Went on two more dates and today I went over to her place for dinner and you know what after. (Not in a scum bag way, the s*x is great and we‚Äôve both talked about it being that way due to our personalities matching so well too)
She is exactly my type looks and personality wise, honestly someone I could see myself being with for a very long time.

However, today when we were laying in bed she finally confessed to having two kids (9 and 12). She had them when she was young, got divorced when they were only a few years old, and decided to have her parents raise them along with the ex‚Äôs parents. 
She then proceeded to say that she has always been in their life, and they do consider her their mother and love her as one, despite not living with her. I believe some mental health issues and not best career choices in her younger life caused this. 
She just left me with that, and was very shameful about it and asked me to take the time to process that and if I wanted to continue to talk to her then let her know. I could tell she was preparing for it to end right there and was almost in tears saying she would understand either way. 

I have a good career in teaching so truly enjoy kids, and see a future with this women but I‚Äôll be honest it scares me to death. Since I have not really had a push for kids of my own right now.


My friends have always joked that I‚Äôd be a good step dad (due to my past life as a bartender and having my share of moms to take home lol) but also just how great I am with kids in my career, But jokes aside, I‚Äôm scared as fuck to continue but know me and this girl could really be together for a while. 
And she said that for the future the kids would still live with their grandparents and she is happy with that being the case.

üî• **Key Insight**: Happiness isn‚Äôt a destination‚Äîit‚Äôs a skill you build through daily habits. According to Yale psychologist Dr. Laurie Santos, **‚ÄúHappiness is a leaky tire‚Äîit takes constant work to keep it filled.‚Äù** Here‚Äôs how to start filling yours:  

---

### üß† **What We Get Wrong About Happiness**  
Our brains are wired for survival, not joy. Evolution gave us a ‚Äúnegativity bias‚Äù to spot threats, but modern life hijacks this, leaving us stressed and scrolling instead of present and connected. The good news? **You can rewire your brain for happiness with small, science-backed actions.**  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **5 Strategies to Boost Happiness by 5-15%**  
1. **Prioritize Social Connection (Even Micro-Moments)**  
   - Talk to strangers, compliment a barista, or text a friend. Studies show even small interactions reduce loneliness and boost mood. *‚ÄúNobody waves first, but everybody waves back.‚Äù*  

2. **Invest in ‚ÄúTime Affluence‚Äù**  
   - Use money to buy time (outsource tasks, order takeout) and reframe saved time as a gift. *Time confetti* (5-minute gaps) adds up‚Äîuse it mindfully instead of scrolling.  

3. **Practice Gratitude & Savoring**  
   - Write 3 daily gratitudes or mentally note blessings. **Hack:** Imagine losing something/someone you love, then appreciate it anew. Savor small joys (your morning coffee, a sunset).  

4. **Replace Self-Criticism with Self-Compassion**  
   - Treat yourself like a friend: Acknowledge struggles, normalize them (‚ÄúThis is human‚Äù), then ask, *‚ÄúWhat do I need right now?‚Äù*  

5. **Limit Phone Use**  
   - Phones drain presence and joy. Try Dr. Santos‚Äô **‚ÄúW.W.W.‚Äù hack** before unlocking: *What For? Why Now? What Else Could I Do?*  

---

### üö® **Myth Busted: Money ‚â† Happiness**  
Beyond covering basic needs (~$75k/year), income has *zero correlation* with joy. Wealth often means less free time and more stress. **Happiness grows from how you spend your time, not dollars.**  

---

### üí™ **Your Homework (From Dr. Santos‚Äô Classroom)**  
**This week, give 3 genuine compliments** (to strangers, coworkers, or loved ones). Notice how it lifts *their* mood‚Äîand yours. *‚ÄúKindness is a happiness two-for-one.‚Äù*  

üéØ **Why This Works**: These habits combat our brain‚Äôs negativity bias, build resilience, and create lasting neural pathways for joy. Progress isn‚Äôt about going ‚Äú0 to 100‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs about consistent 5% gains.  

**Your Turn**: Which strategy will you try first? Drop a üéØ in the comments if you‚Äôre committing to one (or tag a friend to join you!). Let‚Äôs fill those leaky tires together.

Captain Henry Donnager expected a quiet career babysitting a dusty relic in Area 51. But when a test unlocks a portal to a world of knights and magic, he's thrust into command of Alpha Team, an elite unit tasked with exploring this new realm.

They join the local Adventurers Guild, seeking to unravel the secrets of this fantastical realm and the ancient gateway's creators. As their quests reveal the potent forces of magic, they inadvertently entangle in the volatile politics between local rivalling factions.

With American technology and ancient secrets in the balance, Henry's team navigates alliances and hostilities, enlisting local legends and air support in their quest. In a land where dragons loom, they discover that modern warfare's might‚ÄîHellfire missiles included‚Äîholds its own brand of magic.

**Chapter 35: Delegation**

\-- --

The moment they‚Äôd pulled¬† into Armstrong, their unconscious passengers had become the medical team's problem. Dr. Perdue and her staff had taken one look at the Seekers‚Äô vitals and whisked them straight into the ICU ward. They set them up with IV fluids, electrolytes, glucose ‚Äì basically everything modern medicine knew about treating severe exhaustion, even if the root cause was more paranormal than physiological. Their bodies would have to recover the old-fashioned way while whatever metaphysical batteries they had slowly recharged.



Getting word to the Guild had been next on the checklist. Their new aethergraph operator had raised an eyebrow at Henry‚Äôs message about possessed adventurers and haunted Baranthurian tech, but she‚Äôd gotten it through. The response had been about what he‚Äôd expected when reporting that kind of situation ‚Äì Guildmaster Taldren himself showing up within the hour and clerk Mira at his side, ready to verify their advancement quest‚Äôs completion.



Watching Taldren and Mira take in the medical wing was its own kind of entertainment. They‚Äôd handled themselves well enough through the security checkpoints and ID verification, but the ICU was something else entirely. The steady beeping of cardiac monitors, the soft hiss of oxygen, the screens displaying vital signs in real-time ‚Äì it was probably the closest thing to walking into a Baranthurian facility they‚Äôd experienced outside of ruins. Mira kept sneaking glances at the equipment while trying to maintain her professional demeanor. Even Taldren couldn‚Äôt quite hide his fascination with the pulse oximeter clipped to one Seeker‚Äôs finger.



‚ÄúThey're doing just fine ‚Äì stable vitals, responding well to uh‚Ä¶‚Äù Dr. Perdue glanced at the IV bag, ‚ÄúThe uh, ‚Äòregenerative‚Äô fluids and nutrient support.‚Äù



The way she spoke mirrored that reassuring tone doctors usually used with worried families, but the way she kept glancing at her tablet and data feeds told a different story. ‚ÄúThe mana depletion is severe, but we‚Äôve managed to orally administer some mana potions at Archmage Kelmithus‚Äô advice. I‚Äôd strongly recommend keeping them here under observation until they're fully recovered ‚Äì we have the facilities to monitor them properly, and we can ensure they receive optimal care throughout the regeneration process.‚Äù



‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶‚Äù Taldren trailed off, watching the pulse oximeter like it was some kind of miniature scrying crystal. Guy was trying real hard to look like advanced medical tech didn't faze him, but his curiosity kept winning out. He sighed, ‚ÄúI daresay it shall suffice. Their kin shall no doubt wish to visit, but if the Archmage himself deems this fit, who am I to question such wisdom? Let it be so.‚Äù



Mira moved to check the table where Henry had stacked the Seekers‚Äô Guild IDs earlier. Made that part easy for them at least. ‚ÄúSir Taldren, these‚Äôre the ones we‚Äôve been lookin‚Äô fer, aye. They‚Äôve seen their share o‚Äô trouble, poor souls, but there‚Äôs no mistakin‚Äô ‚Äòem.‚Äù



‚ÄúGood, good. That‚Äôs one matter settled, then,‚Äù Taldren said, shifting his gaze from the unconscious adventurers to Henry. ‚ÄúYou made mention, I believe, of a Baranthurian artifact in your aethergram. Has it aught to do with their present plight?‚Äù



Henry nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be the Soul Cage. Turns out the Baranthurians built ghost traps. The Seekers found the thing right where they were supposed to, but managed to skip right past the warning labels when they tried prying it open. Broke the containment seals and got a face full of those Lesser Specters. We‚Äôve got the thing under containment. It‚Äôs all yours.‚Äù



Taldren gestured for him to lead the way. The containment lab wasn‚Äôt far ‚Äì just past two security checkpoints manned by MPs who‚Äôd clearly been briefed on their unique visitors. Standard procedure, but Henry noticed Mira eyeing their M7s with the same fascination she‚Äôd shown the medical equipment.



The research team had assembled in force ‚Äì Dr. Anderson, Dr. Lamarr, and a handful of their staff scientists clustered around monitors and instruments. Kelmithus stood slightly apart, watching the Soul Cage through the mesh of a Faraday cage.



¬†Inside, the device sat on an isolation platform, the crystals pulsing with an eerie red-green-blue glow. At least the ghosts were still in there. The sooner they got this thing cleared for transport to wherever the Sanctum Arcanum stored their dangerous magical artifacts, the better.



‚ÄúRight then, I've documented what we found when securing it,‚Äù Dr. Anderson said, handing Taldren a sealed folder. ‚ÄúParticularly the damaged mounting brackets and how the Seekers‚Äô attempts to remove it compromised the containment. Needless to say, the Sanctum Arcanum ought to avoid what they did. As long as the crystals stay properly aligned, the entities *should* remain contained. Just... try not to drop it, eh?‚Äù He finished with a nervous chuckle.



‚ÄúThat... mesh cage,‚Äù Taldren said, brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWill it complicate the transfer?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, we can remove it,‚Äù Dr. Lamarr said. ‚ÄúIt was just a precaution for our examination. We can help your transport team with the handoff.‚Äù



‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù Taldren nodded. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve a carriage waiting outside. Miss Lenton, if you would summon the Sanctum Arcanum‚Äôs men and oversee the transfer?‚Äù



‚ÄúAye, Guildmaster.‚Äù She turned to Dr. Anderson. ‚ÄúMight we borrow some o‚Äô yer folk to help with the movin‚Äô?‚Äù



As the researchers began coordinating with Mira on safely transferring the Soul Cage, Taldren turned to Henry and his team. He pulled a small journal from his robes, flipping through its pages. ‚ÄúNow then, to business. The conditions of your advancement quest were to find the Seekers and assess the cause of their disappearance. Both lie before me, accompanied with notes that are, I must say, admirably thorough. And the Seekers themselves ‚Äì they are alive and stable. Given what they faced, this is no small feat. Your primary task is accomplished, and well at that.‚Äù



Behind him, Dr. Lamarr directed some of the lab techs as they carefully dismantled the Faraday cage. Mira had left and returned with two robed figures ‚Äì Sanctum Arcanum mages by the look of their insignias ‚Äì with a pair of very alert MPs shadowing their every move. They seemed a bit tense over the newcomers, but relaxed a bit when the mages started wrapping up the device with some sort of tarp. Looked like base security was just as happy as he was to get the haunted Baranthurian tech off their hands and into somebody else‚Äôs problem pile.



‚ÄúFurthermore,‚Äù Taldren continued as he jotted down some notes, ‚Äúyou have seen their original mission through to its end. The artifact, for all its troublesome properties, is now in hand.‚Äù He closed his journal. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve well proven the mettle of Tier 7 Adventurers. For now, take your rest. Return to the Guild on the morrow. We shall have your rewards and documentation ready ere the clock strikes noon.‚Äù



‚Äì ‚Äì



Taldren‚Äôs suggestion for rest was a nice thought, but reality had other plans. Dwyer had already scheduled them for an early morning intel brief on the Ovinne situation. Between that and the noon Guild appointment, their day was gonna be packed tight with PowerPoint, paperwork, and probably a whole lot of shopping once they had those lumen rewards in hand.



The briefing room was already packed when they arrived. General Harding sat front and center, Ambassador Perry beside him with his aide taking notes. The Stryker crew had grabbed the back row, probably planning to catch some sleep during the political portions. That CIA guy, Dwyer, stood near the podium checking something on his laptop, while Captain Sinclair arranged her notes at the front.



Henry took the thermos of tea Sera had brought ‚Äì some Gaerran blend that actually beat coffee for caffeine content ‚Äì and found seats with his team near the front. The projector cycled through Reaper reconnaissance footage, overlaid with local maps from Guild cartographers. The drones had done good work updating the older charts, especially where winter had changed the terrain around the trade road. Most of the mountain passes were still obscured by heavy cloud cover, though ‚Äì typical January weather up there. Clear skies in the Ovinne range were about as rare as a Tier 1 adventurer with common sense.



Harding cleared his throat, and the quiet murmur of conversation died down. ‚ÄúCaptain Sinclair, you have the floor.‚Äù



‚ÄúRoute to Krevath is 144 miles, following the main trade road,‚Äù she began, laser pointer tracking their path. ‚ÄúFour-lane compacted earth, well-maintained. Think I-35, minus the asphalt. Enstadt's another 177 beyond that.‚Äù She highlighted several points along the route.¬†



‚ÄúWe'll be running a seven-vehicle convoy,‚Äù Sinclair continued, bringing up the formation diagram. ‚ÄúStryker takes point, followed by our security personnel. Ambassador's MRAP and the MTVR in the middle, with Alpha Team‚Äôs vehicles providing close escort. Sheriff UGV brings up the rear guard.‚Äù



The next slide showed their comms setup. The image showed an aerostat floating above Armstrong Base. ‚ÄúTCOM gives us 250 miles of coverage from here, courtesy of the planet‚Äôs increased size. Your vehicle radios are good for 90, maybe 120 depending on magical interference. We‚Äôll have one MRAP designated as runner if we need to relay back to base.‚Äù She clicked forward again. ‚ÄúISR support from rotating Reapers and Global Hawks for continuous route mapping, monitoring, and comms, but remember ‚Äì no armed air assets. You‚Äôll get that after the Ambassador works his magic, hopefully. Too late by then, I know, but it‚Äôs a limitation we have to deal with.‚Äù



Her comment earned a few restrained chuckles.



Then came the timeline. ‚ÄúDeparture‚Äôs set for 0600 two days from now. That gives us tomorrow for final prep and equipment checks. Weather forecast‚Ä¶‚Äù She clicked through a series of thermal passes showing the cloud patterns. ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs an active snowstorm along the route. Manageable even without envirosuits, but it may upgrade to blizzard conditions near Krevath. Road‚Äôs getting regular clearance from standard caravan traffic, but that just means the roads are going to be usable.‚Äù



Henry studied the forecasts. The Ovinne Mountains made Alaskan winters look like a day at the beach. Even with the trade road getting maintained, they‚Äôd be facing white-out conditions if that storm picked up. Still, they had the vehicles for it ‚Äì assuming the MTVR‚Äôs chains held up on those compacted earth roads.



Dwyer stepped up as Sinclair wrapped the route brief. The guy looked tired ‚Äì probably spent half the night coordinating with the Guild‚Äôs information network to piece together the latest updates from Krevath. ‚ÄúSituation‚Äôs getting complicated up there,‚Äù he began, switching to imagery of the town. ‚ÄúKrevath‚Äôs normal population is about eleven thousand. They're currently housing around eight hundred refugees from outlying settlements in a makeshift camp outside the walls. Guild estimates we‚Äôll see that number climb past a thousand by the time we arrive. Several nearby villages are already evacuating ahead of the weather and increased monster activity.‚Äù



The drone footage showed the camp clearly ‚Äì a hodgepodge of tents and temporary structures cordoned off by earthen barriers. Local mages must have raised those walls, given how uniformly they curved around the settlement. It was the best move they could‚Äôve made to protect those refugees, even if it did make the place look like a medieval FEMA camp.



‚ÄúThere are multiple factors driving the displacement,‚Äù Dwyer continued. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing increased monster activity throughout the region ‚Äì likely a combination of seasonal migration and disruption from the Elemental Dragon. Mithril Order and other Clans are trying to coordinate defense, but they‚Äôre spread thin.‚Äù He clicked through several thermal images showing various creature types.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôve identified several new mid-to-high tier species in the mix. Crystallons: armored carnivorous horses with crystal growths, Tier 7 minimum. We think they can take as much a beating as a Bradley but are a helluva lot more mobile. And they can use magic. Durnasks ‚Äì imagine an armadillo but with porcupine spikes. Tiers 5 through 7; easy pickings. Just don‚Äôt let any get too close. Then the Bralnors: basically gorillas in natural rocky armor. The weakest bralnor can pretty much go toe to toe with a Minotaur Chieftain, so watch out for them. And of course, we‚Äôve also got the usual suspects ‚Äì goblin raiders, hobgoblin platoons, fenwyrms, and so on. They‚Äôre hitting refugee columns, which is driving more people toward the larger settlements.‚Äù



The next slides showed an aerial perspective of the defensive situation. Looked rough ‚Äì the town guard must be pulling double duty between monster threats and managing the growing refugee population. According to the Guild, even with Mithril Order support, they were stretched to their limits. Half their resources were tied up just keeping the camp secure and stopping the goblins from picking off stragglers.



Dwyer gestured to Perry. ‚ÄúMister Ambassador, would you like to cover the aid package?‚Äù



Perry stood. ‚ÄúThe MTVR‚Äôs got humanitarian aid for the town, on top of our own supplies. We‚Äôre bringing in aid from the Guild and the Sonaran government ‚Äì healing potions, warming charms, mana crystals. Plus our own contributions: tents, thermal blankets, preserved rations, water, medical supplies. Our objective, outside of getting to Enstadt in one piece, will be to get these supplies to the town.‚Äù



He trailed off, leaving the implication unspoken. These people needed help, but damn if they weren‚Äôt gonna take advantage of that and show Ovinnegard just what great neighbors they could be. It was kinda fucked up, in a way.



Ryan raised his hand. ‚ÄúWe gonna be runnin‚Äô escort for them refugee caravans too, ain‚Äôt we?‚Äù



Perry nodded. ‚ÄúIf possible, yes. But we shouldn‚Äôt see any more incoming refugees by the time we get there, right?‚Äù He turned to Dwyer and Sinclair for clarification.¬†



‚ÄúEh, 90%,‚Äù Dwyer responded casually.¬†



‚ÄúAny other questions?‚Äù Sinclair asked.¬†



They had none.



‚ÄúAlright, then. You have Guild business in a couple hours, I believe. Get your gear sorted by tomorrow. Wheels up at 0600 two days from now.‚Äù



They had a lot to do before then. Guild ceremony first to get their promotion and officially add Sera to their Party, then hitting the market district for supplies they couldn‚Äôt get from the quartermaster. Maybe grab lunch at that restaurant between Red Sail and Spellbound ‚Äì apparently the chef there had the luxury of trying cheeseburgers at the base and had put his own spin on it with cav meat. Then finally, back to base to requisition their gear and help load the MTVR.

1iybtc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1iybtc2/why_does_the_breville_bambino_espresso_machine/,Why does the Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS deliver exceptional quality? A detailed review of this compact espresso maker,"The Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS has been my go-to for brewing espresso at home for the past few weeks. As someone who enjoys experimenting with coffee, this compact machine has impressed me in many ways while also exposing a few areas for improvement. Designed for coffee enthusiasts who crave barista-quality results, the Bambino promises a lot‚Äîand it mostly delivers.

**Design & Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the Bambino exudes elegance. Its brushed stainless steel exterior gives it a sleek and modern look, fitting seamlessly into my kitchen setup. Measuring just 13.7"" in depth and 6.3"" in width, it takes up very little counter space. This compact size is a blessing for small kitchens or apartments. However, I noticed that some of the components, like the tamper, feel a bit lightweight, almost bordering on flimsy. Despite this, the machine remains sturdy and well-constructed.

**Features**

This espresso maker is loaded with features that cater to both beginners and seasoned coffee lovers. The automatic steam wand, for instance, is a standout. It allows you to adjust the milk temperature and texture, making it easier to create microfoam for latte art. The low-pressure pre-infusion ensures even extraction, while the digital temperature control (PID) maintains the optimal brewing temperature. One feature I found particularly exciting is the thermojet technology, which heats up the machine in just three seconds. Gone are the days of waiting for your coffee maker to warm up!

[Check Breville Bambino Espresso Machine BES450BSS price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0b1jppg2l/)

**Brewing Performance**

The Bambino is a powerhouse when it comes to brewing espresso. I experimented with both single and double shots, and the results were consistently robust and flavorful. The 54mm portafilter ensures full-bodied espresso, a feature I really appreciated during my taste tests. However, the lack of a built-in grinder means you‚Äôll need to invest in a separate one, which adds to the cost and counter space requirements.

**Coffee Quality**

The quality of coffee produced is stellar. I tried various beans and grind sizes, and while it took a bit of trial and error to get the perfect shot, the Bambino consistently delivered rich, aromatic espresso. The digital temperature control played a huge role in maintaining consistency, which is vital for achieving that perfect cup.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

Milk frothing is where the Bambino truly shines. The steam wand is automatic yet customizable, allowing you to adjust the milk‚Äôs texture to your liking. I managed to create smooth microfoam that enhanced my lattes and cappuccinos. The wand‚Äôs power is surprisingly strong for such a small machine, making it a joy to use. My niece even tried her hand at frothing milk and was thrilled to successfully make her first latte art!

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The water tank, while compact, holds a decent amount of water for multiple shots. Positioned at the back, it‚Äôs detachable and easy to refill. However, its location can be a bit inconvenient if the machine is placed under low-hanging cabinets, as you‚Äôll need to pull it out to access the tank.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

One of my favorite aspects of the Bambino is its user-friendly cleaning process. The drip tray and portafilter are easy to remove and wash. The machine also features an automatic cleaning cycle, which can be activated with the press of a button. However, the small drip tray fills up quickly, requiring frequent emptying‚Äîa minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

Thanks to the thermojet heating system, the Bambino is incredibly energy-efficient. It heats up in mere seconds and powers down automatically when not in use. As for noise, it‚Äôs quieter than many other espresso machines I‚Äôve used, which is a bonus for early mornings when the rest of the household is still asleep.

**Warranty & Support**

Breville offers a one-year limited warranty for the Bambino. While I haven‚Äôt had to contact customer support yet, the warranty provides some peace of mind. The included interactive setup guide through the Tilt app was also a helpful touch during the initial setup.

**Advantages**

* Heats up in just three seconds, saving time in the mornings.
* Compact size makes it ideal for small kitchens.
* Automatic steam wand simplifies milk frothing for beginners.
* Consistently produces rich, full-bodied espresso.
* Easy-to-use controls and quick cleaning process.

**Shortcomings**

* No built-in grinder, requiring a separate purchase.
* Some parts feel less durable, like the included tamper.
* Small drip tray needs frequent emptying.

**Competing Products**

When comparing the Breville Bambino to other espresso machines in its category, a few alternatives come to mind. The De'Longhi Dedica is another compact option with a similar price range, but it lacks the advanced milk frothing capabilities of the Bambino. On the higher end, the Gaggia Classic Pro offers more robust construction and manual control but takes up more space and lacks the Bambino‚Äôs rapid heat-up feature. If you value quick setup and ease of use, the Bambino is a clear winner.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its features and performance, the Breville Bambino offers excellent value for its price. It bridges the gap between entry-level and professional espresso machines, making it a worthwhile investment for coffee enthusiasts. While the absence of a built-in grinder is a drawback, the overall quality and convenience justify its cost.

1iybrcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/innervoice/comments/1iybrcf/brainstorming_ways_to_play/,brainstorming ways to play,"I've been thinking a lot lately about the relationship between play and creativity. And what's the difference, really.  

I've tentatively come to the conclusion that play is about trying stuff with no particular goal or outcome in mind. Play is about the experience of it, or ""just to see what happens"". I think play is a way to get a range of experiences that can then act as raw material for your creativity. 

- What happens if you jump in the puddle with both feet instead of just one?

- What happens if you add a sprinkle of cinnamon to your coffee?

- What happens if you draw with a sharpie instead of a pencil?

- What happens if you waterproof your piano and put water inside it? lol (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38VG3oaY4OQ )


And I've (tentatively) come to the conclusion that creativity is about playfully approaching a goal. 

- I want to keep warm - I can wrap a sheet around me or I can knit a sweater that has a pattern of twisted stitches in it. The sheet is more efficient, but the sweater is more satisfying on multiple levels.

- I'm hungry but I'm tired of eating the same thing. What if I put black beans in my mac and cheese? Or sausage in my mashed potatoes? What if I roast my broccoli instead of steaming it?

- An example from real life: My partner plays drums in a rock band and ends up with broken drumsticks on a regular basis. I have a garden. Hey! I can use his broken drumsticks as garden stakes! It turns out I can also slip my PVC pipe ""hoops"" on the drumsticks to anchor them in the ground (the hoops support plastic for when it's cold, and old bedsheets when the sun is too intense).  


**Why don't adults play freeze tag or Red Rover?**

So I've been doing a deeper dive into the idea of ""movement play"" as a solution for ""working out is boring but I need to get more cardio"".  Combine this with the idea of the Artist Date as a time to feed your inner child artist. 

Movement is art. Google for videos of butoh, boogie woogie, belly dance, shaolin, parkour, copoeira. Why do we reserve movement for ""classes"" -- why not just have fun?

**Some ideas to explore**

I was originally inspired a few years ago by GMB's videos on youtube. Here's one, of a mom with young kids, approaching fitness in a playful manner:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOu-cpL88T4

And I found this guy, who approaches movement as more of an art (though most of his videos do demonstrate a fair amount of strength and fitness!) which is what inspired me recently to pick up this idea again: https://youtu.be/ovS42Bmg4lM?si=5CreiN67_CzGBwgp

But a good place to start, is to be a kid again with this deceptively simple and fun dance:  https://youtu.be/K-v4WukyU0o?si=nx_lUzcy5bdEgIN6

Started Mounjaro with .5 dose and progressed to my current dosage of 12.5. I was able to get off insulin fairly quickly. Then in September I got off metformin.

Advice

Don't be fearful of side effects. Just remember that people who have bad side effects are more likely to post about them than those of us who don't have them.

My side effects:
Obviously weight loss. A good side effect.

Initially I had very, mild nausea. Noticeable only if I was just not doing or thinking of anything. Went away in 2-3 weeks. Every once in awhile it came back after a meal. Interestingly not a big meal but a basic meal like a baked chicken thigh.

Hair loss. My hair has thinned out big time. Luckily nowhere near bald, but much thinner.

I'm much colder now. I wear an undershirt and heavy wool sweater in addition to a flannel shirt. I used to sleep in the nude under my heavy down comforter. Now I need pajamas.

Probably lost some muscle mass.

On the 12.5 dosage I've noticed my bowels are moving slower. Which for me is a good thing. I had anal cancer and a lasting side effect of irradiating my anal canal was occasional need to go and not getting to the toilet in time. At 12.5 (I also stopped metformin at the same time so that might get the credit) while the first BM can be on the urgent side, I have no problem getting to the toilet. If I was in the middle of a walk might be a problem, but after drinking coffee and reading the news, no problem.

Not sure of the cause and effect, but I'm eating healthier. Lot more veggies and grapefruit. I've gotten back into baking bread, at least half the bread is whole wheat. I actually make sandwiches with only 4 ounces of deli meat (yes I know).

Advice.

Probably first have a plan on how to eat healthier. I just fell into what I've been doing which was to eat less because I wasn't hungry.

Take before pictures. One in the nude or close to it for your own personal use. You will not see your weight loss. We all keep seeing ourselves as fat even when we've lost significant weight. This will help you see the real difference. Then take before shots that you can share.

Exercise.

Okay so I think I finally convinced myself to try this bc things have been getting so overwhelming lately and my anxiety is really affecting my daily life now and I can‚Äôt do this any longer. 

I‚Äôm just nervous bc this is the first time I‚Äôm taking any meds, I spoke to a friend who just started taking it and she kindve helped convince me along with my therapist. 
My dr told me to take 1 tablet a day for a month and come in to see her in 2w-1 month, to see how it‚Äôs going and then at 1 month take it twice a day. I know I should have asked her this but I got the call when I was with my family and I‚Äôm not comfortable with them knowing (except my mom), so I just got the basic info.  But I wanted to know what time would u typically not take it for that day anymore? I‚Äôm going to take it every morning around 630ish (bc I have clinical) but say in the long run on a Saturday I sleep late one day (which doesn‚Äôt really happen but u don‚Äôt know lol) would taking it at say 12 be late and skip the day? Or still take it? Also, I know people say not to drink on it and some say there fine but just monitor yourself bc you get drunk quicker and stuff, but I‚Äôm going to a dinner with friends from clinical next week and I‚Äôd like to have a drink, but since it‚Äôs in like the first like week or so should I not?? Also caffeine should I completely cut it out?? Or wait to see how I react first for a few weeks then add it back in? I don‚Äôt drink that much anyways but I could definitely cut on the energy drinks so maybe this will help me stop, but sometimes a coffee is nice. I‚Äôm really hoping this works bc my anxiety is bad lately and seeing bad reactions to it is making me more nervous but my therapist said it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try and won‚Äôt know how you react to it unless you do.

#INTRO (tl;dr ‚Äì skip to examples of fallacy & bias or the last section)

We all know that Kurt Cobain was much more a figurative lyricist than literal. I chose the line from ‚ÄúAll Apologies‚Äù because that song means something to me. Though I won‚Äôt force that meaning onto what Kurt wrote, shared, and meant with this song; nor onto you.

In /r/Seattle, we know the side we stand on. I‚Äôm not a Nirvana historian, but I internalize that Kurt‚Äôs use of ‚Äúgay‚Äù in 1993 included more than sexual orientation. It‚Äôs the marginalized communities, individuals, and any other person whose existence is questioned simply because of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù they are. Also, if I recall correctly ‚Äì Kurt just wanted to annoy homophobes.

I‚Äôm just a person who lives in Seattle. I‚Äôm lucky to have an education and the privileges afforded me ‚Äì earned or not ‚Äì but I am not special. I‚Äôve been teaching various topics for about 25 years. It‚Äôs something I love to do, and I am ‚Äì once again ‚Äì lucky to do something I love with topics that interest me. I am passionate about anti-discrimination. My battles are fought in my career and can be personal in that context. Because if you take a checklist of the protected classes in Washington‚Äôs anti-discrimination laws, I fall into several. But I am not special, just as no one else is special. I‚Äôm just as unique as everyone else. I apologize for the clich√©, I don‚Äôt like cliches, they‚Äôre old hat.

Donald Rumsfeld (yes, I know ‚Äì not the best person to quote) once said something that really resonated with me. To paraphrase, ‚Äúunknown unknowns‚Äù can be the most difficult to deal with. Many years later, I studied a legal scholar who compared writing improvement to the four stages of competence. These two ideas inspired a lot of training that I do. It‚Äôs nothing new, but I teach others to synthesize information and apply it to new circumstances. Not the ‚Äúhow‚Äù or the ‚Äúwhat,‚Äù but the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù Something I don‚Äôt think AI can ever do . . .

Now, as to the abrupt and horrible things happening in the US under the current administration.

#FOUR STAGES OF COMPETENCE

1. Unconscious Competence ‚Äì This is about intuition. No one is born with hate. Many humans unconsciously grow to know that love > hate; acceptance > rejection; inclusion > ostracization; equity leads to equality. Not a lot else to say here ‚Äì this is a goal for humankind. For these people, being an ally and treating others as they want to be treated is as easy to them as is breathing.

2. Conscious Competence ‚Äì Most everyone, like me, have unconscious or implicit bias. We work actively to be self-aware, vulnerable, understand others, and learn at any opportunity. Others may have overtly discriminated, but have grown. Never fault someone for this. Humans can accept new information and change their opinions and views. It‚Äôs learning, it‚Äôs a positive trait, it‚Äôs evidence of critical thinking.

3. Conscious Incompetence ‚Äì These are the trolls, the rage-baiters, people who don‚Äôt care that they are wrong, the conservative politicians at the forefront of this climate of hate, and anyone else who (I believe) knows right from wrong, but ignores it. Do not engage with these people. You will never convince someone, who knows they are wrong, to change their view. They sit on TV and claim as fact that refugees eat pets, and will never change their mind even with overwhelming evidence. They cannot think for themselves, and their worldview is not in line with reality.

4. Unconscious Incompetence ‚Äì These are who we need to reach. Speaking objectively and without malice, these are the people that need to develop and practice critical thinking skills. These are the people who ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt know.‚Äù There is no fault here, at least in my mind. It‚Äôs very important that we distinguish this stage from conscious incompetence. The approach to help these people includes providing the issue‚Äôs substance and hoping to get them to at least understand it; and secondly, helping them identify flaws in logic and cognitive bias. Horse and water clich√©, blah blah blah‚Ä¶

#EXAMPLES ‚Äì LOGICAL FALLACIES & COGNITIVE BIAS

A **fallacy** is a flaw in reasoning. Used purposely, they can be manipulative tricks or illusions of thought. It is a way to make an argument appear to be valid if the fallacy goes unnoticed. One critical point however ‚Äì an argument or position is not wrong simply because it contains a fallacy (the ‚Äúfallacy fallacy‚Äù). You can do the math wrong, but still get the right answer.

A **cognitive bias** is our animal brain using shortcuts (‚Äúheuristics‚Äù) that end up making our thinking irrational. It can also be a reaction when exposed to thinking that challenges our view. In most circumstances, it‚Äôs your subjective perception or construction of reality. Being self-aware, questioning your conclusions, evaluating evidence, asking ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm wrong?‚Äù These are hallmarks of a critical thinker challenging their biases.

###Strawman Fallacy ‚Äì

* Misrepresenting someone‚Äôs argument to make it easier to counter or attack.
* Person A ‚Äì ‚Äúthe right to body autonomy should not be questioned, it‚Äôs an inherent and inalienable human right.‚Äù
* Person B ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy are you an advocate for the murder of children? Everybody knows murder is wrong.‚Äù

###Slippery Slope Fallacy ‚Äì
* Because one thing (X) happens, another (Y) will happen as a consequence. This shifts the focus from the argument of (X) to (Y), where (Y) was not under discussion and is easier to attack.
* Person A ‚Äì ‚ÄúIn discrimination law, ‚Äòsex‚Äô also means gender identity and sexual orientation.‚Äù
* Person B ‚Äì ‚ÄúBut what about the children? I don‚Äôt want men in the girls‚Äô bathroom, I don‚Äôt want groomers! What‚Äôs next? People marrying their pets?‚Äù

###Ad Hominem Fallacy ‚Äì
* Attack the person, not the argument.
* Person A ‚Äì ‚ÄúRefugees and immigrants are part of what makes our country great! I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre separating children from their families and questioning people‚Äôs citizenship.‚Äù 
* Person B ‚Äì ‚ÄúSnowflake.‚Äù

###Tu Quoque Fallacy ‚Äì
* Whataboutism.
* Person A ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unconstitutional to halt gender affirming care.‚Äù
* Person B ‚Äì ‚ÄúWell, Washington violates their Constitution, too.‚Äù

###The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy
* Cherry-picking.
* Person A ‚Äì ‚ÄúVaccines do not cause autism. It‚Äôs been proven over and over again in peer-reviewed scientific papers.‚Äù
* Person B ‚Äì ‚ÄúYes they do, one study proved it.‚Äù [editor‚Äôs note: we all know that paper was withdrawnüòä]

###Fundamental Attribution Error Bias
* You judge others‚Äô character, but not yourself ‚Äì only your circumstances.
* ‚ÄúThe only moral abortion is my abortion.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI pardoned ‚Äòheroes‚Äô wrongfully imprisoned, he‚Äôs corrupt and pardoned corrupt family members.‚Äù

###Self-Serving Bias
* My failures are caused by others, I am personally responsible for my successes.
* ‚ÄúI pulled myself up by my bootstraps, it‚Äôs the illegal immigrants who cost me my job.‚Äù

###Sunk-Cost and Backfire Effect Bias (two that I think are similar)
* When challenged, or when something already figuratively cost you something, you irrationally cling to a belief or believe it even stronger.
* For this one ‚Äì holy shit ‚Äì it‚Äôs how much more support ass-in-chief gets the more horrible everyone learns he is and the more horrible things he does.

###In-Group and Groupthink Bias (two more that are fairly similar)
* This one is arguably the animal-brain working for our protection. Unfairly favoring who you identify with, letting the social dynamics of a group come to ‚Äì let‚Äôs say ‚Äì less than optimal solutions. This was the Challenger disaster. It‚Äôs a strong bias that causes people to cling to the in-group for fear of being pushed to the out-group or are uncomfortable dissenting because of fear.
* If you recall the Harris / Walz commercials speaking to women to vote in their interests, this was done to overcome this bias.

###Survivorship and Declinism Bias (and another two)
* This is the pair I absolutely despise. When it comes to human rights or anti-discrimination, this causes people to think everything‚Äôs new or everything‚Äôs getting worse. They ‚Äúfeel‚Äù everything was better back in the day, and any attempt to change the status quo is an affront to the world as they believe it to be, and further - discrimination against them. It shows lack of deductive reasoning, inability to accept humanity‚Äôs past failures, and ignorance as to why people simply exist today.

* *Why do so many kids have autism now? How come everyone is on ADHD medication now?* They‚Äôve always been here. Now they‚Äôre not institutionalized or lobotomized; now science has progress enough that we can distinguish and diagnose; they‚Äôve always been able to live fulfilling lives, and we now have the ability understand and support our fellow humans. Autism and ADHD has existed for as long as modern humanity.

* *How come everyone is transexual / non-binary / gay / bi-sexual / lesbian / questioning?* And the list goes on to include everyone. Well, we‚Äôve always existed as humans together. Police don‚Äôt storm ‚ÄúStonewalls‚Äù anymore, AIDS was addressed, they are not murdered by the state anymore (unfortunately, not world-wide, and of course there is still hate crime), and the list goes on here, too. We‚Äôve progressed as a society, more than ever ‚Äì people are being accepted for who they are, and not marginalized because of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù they are.

* *COVID is just the flu. I had it, and I am fine. We made it through the bubonic plague!* Well, yes ‚Äì we‚Äôre here, but millions died.

* An awful, awful bias.

#ALL IN ALL IS ALL WE ARE - What can we do?

I know this is reddit, and arguing online is futile. But every once in a while, you spot something. You see immature or underdeveloped thinking, honest but incorrect beliefs, or something that just intuitively seems to suggest the person behind the keyboard may be able to come around.

Likewise, we all have a circle of people. Some more than others, but there‚Äôs family, friends, coworkers, the regulars you see at your favorite coffee shop, and even the strangers on the bus with you. Observe, react, be an ally. Callout unconscious incompetence. Learn when another is willing to engage in discussion. We can be there for each other, but each in our way. Most of all though, be safe.

As for me ‚Äì I will keep working, advocating for the protected classes I serve in my employment. I will point out every flaw in a person‚Äôs argument, and dismantle any excuse for abuse against another. I write to do that ‚Äì sometimes better, sometimes worse. I will also keep supporting the organizations I believe in.

Most of all though, I will practice. ‚ÄúArguing‚Äù is a huge part of my job, it‚Äôs what our judicial system is based on, and I believe in it. The conscious incompetent are baseballs in a batting cage. They come at you a little different each time, but I use my fallacy/bias bat and my athleticism of facts. Some of that practice is around here on reddit. My hope is that there is a lurker, a contributor, or really anyone who happens by and learns something.

That is what I will do. What will you do?

>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt play though, when I play shows I play those like play-doh, and I‚Äôm paid though‚Äù - Shad

>‚ÄúAs time goes by, in this give and take; as long as I learn, I will make mistakes‚Äù ‚Äì Beastie Boys

> ‚ÄúI will hold the candle; ‚Äòtil it burns up my arm; oh, I‚Äôll keep takin‚Äô punches; until their will grows tired‚Äù ‚Äì Pearl Jam

I (28M) have had a crush on this girl (24F) at work for months. We work in the same office space but for different companies. We‚Äôve never really had a personal conversation, just the usual ‚Äúhello,‚Äù ‚Äúgoodbye,‚Äù and occasional smiles.


Back in Nov-December, she was the one who seemed to start things. She‚Äôd stare at me frequently (once staring at me like 5 times in not even 5mn), smile and even came to my office door (without any real reason) just to say, ‚ÄúHappy holidays‚Äù before Christmas. At that point, we had never really spoken. Note that she doesn‚Äôt speak at all to any other people from my company.

Over the months, we‚Äôve had so many moments‚Äîeye contact, glances, double glances, even blushes at some point/slight awkwardness when crossing paths. It wasn‚Äôt just in my head; even some coworker noticed.

But despite all that, we never really talked.

I got the impression that she‚Äôs quite reserved, especially around me. Even in december there was a week where she would stare at me for prolonged period of times, then a week where she would act like I don't exist (literally), and then the last workday of the month she went to greet me happy holidailys just before leaving, out of the blue. WTF

So onemonth ago I went to see her and introduce myself, asking what job she does. She basically did the same stuff. I thought it was awkward, but since then she's been greeting me everyday, sometimes even when I don‚Äôt really notice her.

A couple of weeks ago, I randomy heard her coworkers saying that she was sick for a week, so I sent her a quick ‚ÄúHope you feel better, get well soon"" kind of message on Teams. She took six days to reply with a simple, ‚ÄúHey ! Thank you very much that's nice of you‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt cold, but it wasn‚Äôt particularly warm either. Note that at this point it was probably obvious to her I had a crush. We‚Äôre on the same network but I had to dig to find her profile.

That response made me doubt everything, but at the same time, she kept initiating ‚Äúhellos‚Äù and ‚Äúgoodbyes‚Äù after she came back to the office, even making eye contact with me randomly and smiling.

So, last week, I finally decided to break the cycle and sent her a message on Teams, inviting her for a casual coffee. I phrased it in a super low-pressure way, even giving her an easy out.
I wanted to invite her IRL, but considering the workplace, it's very hard to not be around coworkers, and people in both companies really don‚Äôt talk a lot to each other, I'd even say there are casual beefs lol.


The problem now:

It‚Äôs now been 4 days, and she hasn‚Äôt opened or responded to the message.

She‚Äôs been acting normal at work, but the unanswered message is just there.


What I don‚Äôt understand:

If she‚Äôs not interested, why not just say ‚Äúno‚Äù politely? I literally gave her an easy way to decline, saying that if she doesn‚Äôt really have the time there is no problem.

If she is interested, why ignore the message?

Could she just be avoiding it because she doesn‚Äôt know what to say?

Am I overthinking, or is she just not interested and avoiding rejection altogether?
There is some part in me that tells me I was just imagining stuff all along, but then the rational part in me CANNOT think that she wasn‚Äôt interested in some way or another.

I don‚Äôt want to create awkwardness, but the silence is making things weird. Should I just let it go? How should I act if she never replies? Would appreciate any insights.

And btw, I'm happy I did this move if anything. Kinda relieved, despite everything. Surely the fact that we work at the same place but not the same company doesn‚Äôt make the thing completely unbearable, it's just awkward and frustating.",2,1740531742.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I had a best friend from the ages of 16-20. We were closest as teens and toward the end it felt like I was forcing things. I realized at the very end of our friendship that if I stop hitting her up, she‚Äôll never reach out. I was right. I guess we needed our early 20s to discover ourselves because she had a whole new friend group. Now we‚Äôre both in our mid 20s and she recently refollowed my social media. Because of this I said hey how are you. Long story short we noticed we‚Äôre both part of the same community group and we met up for coffee after the group met. The group is fairly large/ has different locations so I didn‚Äôt realize she was part of it before. 


After this she said it was fun let‚Äôs do it again. We never did anything after. I tried to ask her if she‚Äôs free and she said she is. It was vague and I worried she didn‚Äôt want me to overstep like last time. I didn‚Äôt have many friends in the past so I‚Äôd message her a lot but she never said it bothered her but I think it did. I tried to kinda ask in current time but she brushed the topic away, she made some references to past jokes and memories and how we should do stuff in the future. 

I was gonna reach out but her social media was de activated. I recently noticed she came up on people you may know, but a new account. She follows some people but idk. I‚Äôm not opposed to a friendship and I‚Äôm not keeping score of who asks who to hang out I just got really anxious and agoraphobic in recent years so it‚Äôs impacting me too.

You read that right‚ÄîAI is no longer just a subplot in your tech courses; it‚Äôs taking center stage. Starting this fall, students can dive headfirst into the intricate world of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and all the baffling marvels in between.

And yet, while AI majors are about as common as a unicorn sighting, Carroll University's move indicates a growing trend‚Äîeducational institutions are arming future workforces with tools that may one day outwit, outsmart, and maybe even out-employ us. The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire is following suit, planning its own AI major for next fall. Clearly, the academic landscape is evolving faster than you can say ""neural network.""

Of course, for those scanning the horizon for a high-tech haven to hone their skills, Milwaukee is starting to look like ground zero with offerings popping up like mushrooms after the rain. Waukesha County Technical College, for one, has already paved the way with a two-year AI degree. Even Milwaukee School of Engineering is getting in on the action with new AI certificates.

So, while AI majors might still be the rare species in academia, they‚Äôre certainly gaining ground. It makes you wonder‚Äîhow long before having a degree in AI is as ubiquitous as your morning coffee?

1iyb1r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1iyb1r3/wtf_even_is_mental_load_is_my_marriage_fucked/,WTF even is mental load? Is my marriage fucked?,"**Background**: We are 41M and 42F, married for 17 years.  2 boys, 6 and 9.  I'm AuDHD (unmedicated because my BP doesn't handle stims well and the non-stim meds do jack shit for me) and she has diagnosed anxiety and depressions issues (also medicated).  I work in a full time office job with an hour commute on each end and make an objectively high salary to anyone aside from wall street or silicon valley types.  She has her own small bookkeeping business, roughly 25 hours a week WFH and brings in roughly 1/3 of what I do.  I make enough that she could be a SAHM, which she was until our youngest was in pre-k, but her income allows us to go on more vacations and save more aggressively for retirement.  First world problems, I know.

Since any post by a man ends up with the comments accusing them of not doing enough around the house or with the kids, here‚Äôs my list:

* I cook dinner 60-70% of the time (and only enjoy the 20% of the time that it‚Äôs on the grill or smoker).  I wash dishes 90-100% of the time, even when she cooks, and she‚Äôs an objectively messier chef than I am.  I‚Äôm nearly always the one to unload the dishwasher as well.
* I do everyone‚Äôs laundry, though I don‚Äôt fold hers.  I fold my own, and I fold the kids around 60% of the time.
* I make the kids their school lunches every night before I close up the kitchen and turn in upstairs.
* I handle all after-school sports, including practices, games, and occasional coaching.  I‚Äôm an engaged dad and constantly play catch, wrestle, ride bikes, etc. with the kids plus occasional coaching.
* We have a cleaner that handles deep cleans every 2 weeks, but I‚Äôm generally the one who ensures the floor is picked up so at least the Roomba can run twice a week.  I keep my side of the bathroom sink clean as well as the kids' bathroom counter.
* I handle reading and bedtime with the kids every night.
* I make sure she has a hot coffee in her thermos the way she likes it before I leave the house every morning.
* I‚Äôve screwed up one birthday in nearly 20 years of being together, I normally knock it out of the park.  I do the same for Christmas, Mother‚Äôs Day, Valentine‚Äôs Day, etc.  Meanwhile mine are generally treated as an afterthought.
* I plan dates, arrange for babysitters, and show up with flowers unannounced regularly.
* I help her avoid anxiety triggers, i.e. going into a bar to get her credit card the next day that she left after a night out, or calling in literally any take-out order we‚Äôve made ever
* I‚Äôve planned the kids‚Äô birthday parties for the past 3 years.

What I don‚Äôt do:

* Handle the calendar.  She insists on keeping a paper calendar, which does fuck all for me when I‚Äôm at work, so I always have to call an ask about scheduling literally anything.
* Pay the bills, she‚Äôs better at handling the money as a bookkeeper.
* Earn enough money apparently (see the issue below)
* I had issues setting boundaries with my mom in the past due to childhood trauma and AuDHD making it hard for me to respond, but those have been handled for years.
* plan the vacations.

My lone bit of ‚Äúme time‚Äù is working out and occasional video games.  I‚Äôm also in objectively great shape for someone my age, and I hit the gym 6 days a week, waking up at 4:45AM in order to do so without impacting anybody else in the family‚Äôs schedule.  With my commute to work I‚Äôd have to leave before the kids are up for school regardless, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd be helping out with breakfast if I skipped the gym.  My gaming consists of maybe 2 hours of Switch per week, though I might have a Sunday afternoon binge once a month.

**The issue**: It just seems like whatever I do, it is *not ever enough,*  and however much I do and where my mental state is ignored ‚Äì I just need to WoRk HaRdEr.  I only get comparisons to her friends who have husbands that out-earn me or have significant family money backing them, where their wives are almost literally kept women. It doesn‚Äôt help that her dad was out-earning my current salary by >$100k in the 90s, so her she grew up watching her mom want for nothing as well.  Any time I take time for me, I‚Äôm accused of taking her for granted and not respecting her mental load and that she doesn‚Äôt *so much*.  I just don‚Äôt see it.  I‚Äôm not going to re-type what I already put up there, but suffice it to say I think I do more than my fair share.

To add on to the mental stress I‚Äôm under, I‚Äôm working on finding a new job since my current contract is up this summer, so anytime I‚Äôm not working on everything else, I‚Äôm networking, applying for things, upskilling, etc.  Being the breadwinner, I know I literally cannot gap my work, as we‚Äôre not anywhere close to being able to survive on her income.  Any time I try to bring up how much I actually do I feel like it falls on deaf ears.  She just points to her mental load because she takes the kids to the doctor/dentist, handles parent teacher conferences, be home when a contractor shows up (that I have to call and schedule even though she controls the calendar), etc.

I feel like she‚Äôs spent too much time in FB mom groups and has internalized all of the horror stories of shitty husbands with women carrying the load, and she‚Äôs using the ‚Äúmental load‚Äù term as a cudgel to end any argument into my mental well being in the marriage.  I‚Äôm not the best at expressing my feelings (AuDHD), particularly in the moment rather than having the chance to write them out like I am here, so I‚Äôm sure that impacts my ability to be heard, but I‚Äôm not sure.  To add insult to injury, I can‚Äôt remember the last time she‚Äôs initiated sex, though it‚Äôs not exactly a dead bedroom at 2.5x per month, but god it would feel good to feel actually desired every now and again, and yes, I make sure she gets hers before I get mine in the process.  I think her resentment about us just being upper-middle class and not rich is overshadowing everything else.

I know it sounds like I‚Äôm dragging her pretty hard here, but I do love her.  She‚Äôs a genuinely nice person, a good mom, but I feel like she has a blind spot for me specifically. I‚Äôm at a point where I just want to feel appreciated and heard, but I‚Äôm not getting that and can‚Äôt figure out how to make her get it.  I‚Äôm not ready to throw in the towel yet, but I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to keep this up either. Thanks for letting me vent.",4,1740531271.0,Marriage,13,0.7,False

Guess what? You can. It's time to ditch the limitations of your perceived reality and step into a universe of infinite possibilities.

Tom Campbell's My Big TOE framework suggests that reality is a virtual construct, and your consciousness isn't confined to this physical world. You're a multidimensional being with the ability to project your awareness into other realities.

Ready for an interdimensional coffee break? Here's how to make it happen:

1. **Set the Scene:** Imagine a cozy cafe, unlike any you've seen before. Maybe it's nestled in the heart of a bustling alien city, or perhaps it overlooks a breathtaking nebula. Picture three of your extraterrestrial friends waiting for you, each with their own unique appearance, personality, and captivating stories to tell.
2. **Project and Control:** This isn't just a daydream; it's a reality you can access. Project your awareness into this scene. Feel the weight of your alien-designed chair, the warmth of the cup in your hand, and the hum of conversation around you. Take control of this version of you, just as you control your physical body here.
3. **Engage and Explore:** Strike up a conversation with your ET companions. Ask about their culture, their technology, their favorite nebulae to visit. Maybe even suggest they take you on a tour of their world. Feel the connection, the camaraderie, and the thrill of experiencing this new reality firsthand.

**More Than Just a Daydream:**

This isn't just a fun exercise; it's a glimpse into your true potential. You're not limited to observing other realities; you can actively participate in them. Your human body is just one tool you use to interact with this particular reality. You have other versions of yourself in other realities, ready to explore and experience.

So, why settle for just one reality when you can have them all? Share your interdimensional adventures in the comments below! Let's break free from the confines of our perceived world and unlock the limitless possibilities of the multiverse together.",3,1740531125.0,TomCampbellMBT,0,0.81,False

***Tuesday***

‚ÄúMason‚Äôs family has a nice setup here,‚Äù Skylar said as they passed over the final cattle grid and entered the space dedicated to the main house. It was night and day between the two areas, with a gorgeously manicured lawn on the house side and long grass meant for pasture on the other.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very rural,‚Äù Angus agreed tactfully.

The main house was two storeys, with the largest wrap-around veranda that Skylar had ever seen to double the floor space on the first floor that sat three steps above ground level. White latticework was installed behind the steps, probably to keep animals from hiding under the house, and white-painted wooden spindles created a waist-high balustrade. The walls were also white, except for the red brick in the corners of the building, the chimney, and as a background accent for the bright red double front doors. Beige shutters framed each of the eight front-facing windows.

As Angus pulled up outside the house, one of the two front doors opened, and a teenager, most likely Mason‚Äôs little sister, came running to the edge of the veranda.

Of the three men that were following them, only the motorbike crossed the cattle grid to come into the homestead, and only after whoever was riding it waited long enough to pick up one of the two horse riders. The other rider stayed behind to secure the reins to the fence before jogging the rest of the way.

Skylar realised that the person getting the ride was much older than she‚Äôd first thought, especially when the motorbike pulled up behind them, and the passenger used the rider‚Äôs shoulders to lift himself from the seat.

Leaving the air-con on for Spike, Angus and Skylar exited the car together, with Angus coming around to stand alongside Skylar while everyone else regrouped at the foot of the stairs. Their poise had them almost in a defensive line, and Skylar certainly hoped Angus didn‚Äôt take it that way.

The older man tipped back his worn cowboy hat to look at them.

‚ÄúWe were told you were expecting us,‚Äù Angus said to break the silence. He reached out his hand to the older man, who Skylar guessed was Mason‚Äôs grandfather. ‚ÄúAngus.‚Äù

‚ÄúDustin,‚Äù the old man replied, shaking his hand. He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. ‚ÄúThis ere‚Äôs me grandson Bill, ‚Äôn Mason‚Äôs pa, Todd.‚Äù

Mason‚Äôs father had been the one securing the horses, so he‚Äôd also been the last to shake hands with Angus.

As Todd stepped back, Angus curled his arm around Skylar‚Äôs waist. ‚ÄúAnd this is my wife, Skylar.‚Äù It flowed so easily from his lips that Skylar wondered how many times he‚Äôd said it in relation to Coraltin.

Dustin had been in the process of reaching for Skylar when he paused, and even Mason‚Äôs father stiffened. ‚ÄúAs in Mason‚Äôs vet-boss from the city?‚Äù the older man asked with his head cocked to one side, proving there was nothing wrong with his mind despite his advanced age.

Skylar realised she was going to have to think quickly. Despite having the option to lie about who she was, she knew if they ever met her down the road as Mason‚Äôs boss, it would make things incredibly difficult for all concerned. ¬†‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm still technically on my honeymoon at the moment, so Mason asked if we would swing in on our way past to drop off Spike.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoneymoons,‚Äù the older man snorted derisively. ‚ÄúNo time for that slicker nonsense ‚Äôere.‚Äù

Ben grimaced, then moved past his grandfather to take her hand in his, adding the other to the handshake to instil his sincerity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you ‚Ä¶Mrs‚Äî?‚Äù

*Yeah, right.*¬†As if she was going to admit her marriage could technically revert her name to Nascerdios. ‚ÄúJust Skylar, please. I‚Äôm not changing my last name.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Dustin asked, appalled. ‚ÄúHow else are people meant to know y‚Äô ain‚Äôt single no more?‚Äù He then looked at her left hand. ‚ÄúSpecially when y‚Äô ain‚Äôt wearin‚Äô no weddin‚Äô ring neither.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey open their mouths an‚Äô ask, Gramps,‚Äù the teenager replied from the veranda.

The patriarch of the family swung side-on and scowled up at her. ‚ÄúI knew there weren‚Äôt nuthin‚Äô wrong with you, missy. Time of the month, my ass. Get your tail back to your less‚Äôns ‚Äôfore I find somethin‚Äô better for y‚Äôall to do.‚Äù

While the teenager promptly disappeared back inside, Todd took Skylar‚Äôs hand and repeated his name in case she hadn‚Äôt caught it the first time. The man‚Äôs face was almost as weather-worn as his father‚Äôs behind him, but there was a kindness in his eyes that Skylar had seen every time she looked at Mason.

‚ÄúI just wanted y‚Äô to know, we really appreciate everythin‚Äô y‚Äôve done for our boy. He‚Äôs a good, strong young man with a smart head on his shoulders. Mebbe he gets a little bit too full of himself at times an‚Äô his mouth gets him int‚Äô all sorts a‚Äô trouble, but his heart‚Äôs always been in the right place. Just don‚Äôt let him get away with too much, and if he gives you any hassles, give us a call. We‚Äôll sort him out.‚Äù

Skylar started to understand where Mason got his motormouth from and swallowed her amusement as she returned the handshake. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind, Mister Williams, though I doubt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúTodd, please. Call me Todd.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, for goodness sake, what kind a‚Äô mann‚Äôrs y‚Äôall call this, leavin‚Äô our guests out here to cook in the sun!‚Äù¬† a new, more mature female voice called from the veranda, and when Skylar looked up, there was an older woman with the same size, stature and waves of sun-bleached light brown hair as Mason standing in the open doorway. She stepped out and closed it behind her, wiping her icing powdered hands once more on the thin apron she wore around her waist. ¬†

Todd let go of Skylar‚Äôs hands and joined the woman when she came down the stairs, though he kept over a foot of distance between them out of habit. All the men did, and Skylar guessed decades of living together had taught them not to touch her while they‚Äôd been out working, and she was prepping food.

‚ÄúJune, this is Skylar Hart and her husband, Angus. Skylar, Angus, this is Mason‚Äôs mother, June.‚Äù

June Williams balked for half a second, then smiled broadly and wrapped Skylar up in a huge hug. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs so wond‚Äôful to meet y‚Äôall,‚Äù she said, pulling back long enough to squeeze Skylar‚Äôs shoulders. ‚ÄúMason didn‚Äôt say it were you comin‚Äô, but please, do come in. I‚Äôve just finished icin‚Äô a lavenda‚Äô cake an‚Äô I made a batch of Scotcheroos that‚Äôve just set up. There‚Äôs also tea, green tea and coffee, since I weren‚Äôt sure what y‚Äôall tastes would be.‚Äù

Skylar had no idea what either of those foods tasted like, but the three men's appreciative breathing and straightening expressions suggested they were highly prized. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to, thank you.‚Äù

Bill moved as if he had every intention of entering the house, but his uncle (Skylar assumed Todd was his uncle since he was Dustin‚Äôs grandson and Mason had no brothers, only one sister) grabbed him by the back of his flannel shirt and hauled him back towards his bike.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt eat ‚Äôtil we‚Äôre done,‚Äù Dustin said in agreement. The oldest of the three generations then tipped his hat to Skylar and Angus and said, ‚ÄúPleasure meetin‚Äô y‚Äôall.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou c‚Äôd stay here if you want, Pa,‚Äù Todd said in earnest. ‚ÄúMe ‚Äôn the boys can finish patchin‚Äô up the north fence. Y‚Äôve been goin‚Äô at it since four this mornin‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs‚Äôve you,‚Äù Dustin growled at his son.

‚ÄúYeah, but I ain‚Äô goin‚Äô on nine‚Äôy eetha‚Äô.‚Äù Todd‚Äôs expression softened. ‚ÄúCome on, Pa. Y‚Äôr s‚Äôpose to be retired. Go ‚Äôn take a load off.‚Äù

Suddenly the motorbike engine kicked over, and Bill swung his bike towards the front drive, dropping it into gear and taking off the way he‚Äôd come.

Dustin snorted at his vanishing back.

‚ÄúLeave ‚Äôim be, Pa. He ain‚Äôt stupid enough t‚Äô hang around while we try ‚Äôn talk some sense int‚Äô ya.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop badgerin‚Äô me, boy!‚Äù Dustin snapped. ‚ÄúIf I feel like it, I‚Äôll stay f‚Äôr a bite ‚Äôn join y‚Äôall on the fence line shortly.‚Äù

Todd nodded with a knowing smile, and Skylar could guess why. Dustin may be from an era that didn‚Äôt know how to stop, but at his age, once he did, stiffness would set in, and he wouldn‚Äôt be in any shape to start again until he‚Äôd had a good night‚Äôs sleep. Todd then looked at Angus and Skylar and repeated the same brim tap his father had used. ‚ÄúPleasure meetin‚Äô y‚Äôall,‚Äù he parroted with a warm smile.

‚ÄúLikewise,‚Äù Skylar grinned back.

June slid her arm through Skylar‚Äôs and led her up the stairs first. Angus and Dustin fell in behind.

‚ÄúI tell y‚Äô, getting‚Äô old‚Äôs one a‚Äô the worst things about livin‚Äô so long,‚Äù Dustin griped in a lowered voice that June obviously wasn‚Äôt meant to hear.

‚ÄúDying young would be worse,‚Äù Angus countered.

‚ÄúWait‚Äôll y‚Äô get to my age, son. Then y‚Äôll see.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait‚Äôll you get to mine,‚Äù Angus countered, and Skylar could practically feel his mischievous grin behind her.

She rolled her eyes and shook her head.

# The Quiet Resistance

Professor Eleanor Harlow never meant to become a revolutionary. She'd spent forty-three years teaching in the same brick building at Covington College, wearing the same three cardigans in rotation until they frayed at the elbows. She'd always considered herself unremarkable‚Äîa woman who collected teacups, who still wrote letters to her sister in Michigan on monogrammed stationery, who couldn't properly program her thermostat.

When the government changed, she'd initially continued her routines: toast with marmalade at 6:15 AM, the walk to campus with her canvas tote bag swinging against her hip, office hours where she'd perch on her squeaky chair and dispense advice about comma splices.

The surveillance drones appeared in her seventieth year, hovering outside her office window like peculiar birds. Eleanor found herself tilting her head at them as she might at a puzzling student essay. They were there the morning she received the directive: **all syllabi required pre-approval from the Department of Educational Integrity.**

She pressed the paper flat on her desk with hands spotted like a speckled egg, smoothing it as she might a tablecloth before company. The radiator in her office hissed and clanked, maintaining its decades-old argument with winter.

""Well,"" she said to no one.

""We're discussing Orwell today,"" Eleanor told her Advanced Composition class, noting the government monitor in the back row, a young man who reminded her oddly of her nephew‚Äîthe same habit of clearing his throat before typing something into his tablet. ""But I'd like you to consider how his insights might apply to historical examples beyond the Soviet context.""

The classroom had that particular Wednesday afternoon smell‚Äîdamp wool coats, coffee, the faint chemical tang of whiteboard markers.

After class, she approached Maya, a quiet girl who wore the same green scarf every day, wound three times around her neck like armor. ""Your essay on rhetorical analysis was excellent. I'd like to offer you a spot in my writing workshop.""

The ""workshop"" had begun almost by accident, with a few students who lingered after class, then continued discussions in Eleanor's living room, sitting on her mismatched furniture beneath the faded landscape paintings her mother had left her. The group grew to twenty-three. Eleanor served her grandmother's gingersnaps on chipped plates and, almost without intending to, they began documenting the regime's abuses.

""It's the small details that matter,"" Eleanor explained, stirring her tea with the silver spoon her ex-husband Thomas had once given her for their anniversary. ""Not just the big arrests they try to hide, but the little changes‚Äîthe bakery that closed because the owner said the wrong thing, Mrs. Abernathy's son who didn't come home from university.""

The students sat in her living room beneath the lamp with the crooked shade, some on cushions on the floor because there weren't enough chairs. Outside, a neighbor's wind chimes punctuated their conversation with tinkling discord.

Eleanor had collected histories of Chile, Poland, South Africa, ordering them from the campus bookstore before such books were restricted, reading them late into the night with her glasses sliding down her nose. ""It's like sorting laundry,"" she told the group. ""We separate what's true from what isn't.""

Maya held up her phone. ""They've blocked another three news sites today.""

Eleanor reached into the cabinet where she kept her late mother's recipe box, pulling out pamphlets hidden behind index cards for pound cake and pot roast. ""Then we use paper,"" she said. ""Just like passing notes in class.""

The network grew like a patchwork quilt‚Äîpiece by piece, pattern by pattern. The university librarian who lived with seven cats in a Victorian on Elm Street. The retired reporter who ran the hobby shop downtown and knew everyone's business. The mail carrier who had delivered to the same routes for thirty years and could track where people had gone.

Eleanor recorded testimonies at her scratched kitchen table, offering tea and patience while survivors talked. She kept the records in an alphabetized filing system because proper organization had always mattered to her. When they uncovered the regime's financial dealings, it was because someone noticed a recurring decimal point in an obscure budget report‚Äîthe kind of error that Eleanor had always circled in red on student papers.

They came for her on a Tuesday morning. Eleanor had just watered her African violets and was considering what to make for lunch. The officers tracked mud onto her foyer carpet, and she very nearly asked them to wipe their feet.

""Professor Harlow, do you understand the charges against you?"" the judge asked. Eleanor noticed he had the same slightly crooked collar that her colleague Professor Winters always had‚Äîthe sign of a man who dressed without a mirror.

""I understand that documenting truth is not a crime in any just society,"" Eleanor replied, thinking about the plants in her apartment that no one would water, the students who would wonder where she'd gone.

In prison, she taught three fellow inmates to read, organized the meager library by subject, and kept mental notes on the guards' rotating schedules. Her absence became a presence in the movement she'd inadvertently created. People who had never met Eleanor Harlow began doing what she had done‚Äîwatching, recording, remembering.

Three years later, Eleanor stood at a podium on the university quad, leaning slightly to compensate for the hip that had never quite healed after her time in prison. She wore her best cardigan‚Äîblue with pearl buttons‚Äîand had pinned her white hair in a bun that morning with shaking fingers.

The provisional government had asked her to speak at the Day of Restoration ceremony. Eleanor had drafted seven versions of her speech, then discarded them all for being too grandiose. In the end, she'd written something simple on a recipe card.

""I'm not sure how I ended up here,"" she told the crowd, adjusting her glasses. ""I was only doing what my mother taught me to do‚Äîtell the truth and keep good records.""

She looked out at faces she recognized and many she didn't. Former students who now ran newspapers and government offices. The baker who had reopened her shop. Mrs. Abernathy, whose son had finally returned home.

""Writing things down matters. Not because words themselves have power, but because they connect us to each other. They remind us what's real."" She paused to turn her recipe card over. ""When we agree on what's real, we can begin to fix what's broken.""

The applause surprised her‚Äîit seemed excessive for such a simple thing.

Afterward, Eleanor declined three dinner invitations and walked home alone, wanting to check on her apartment. The key still stuck in the lock the way it always had. Inside, someone had watered her plants. On her kitchen table sat a box of student essays waiting to be graded, a reminder that ordinary life continued alongside extraordinary events.

She put on the kettle for tea, opened her grade book, and uncapped her red pen. There would be time for everything else tomorrow.The Quiet Resistance

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.
