1ky73mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ky73mo/an_acquaintance_trauma_dumped_out_of_the_blue/,An acquaintance trauma dumped out of the blue,"So I met this girl at a work-related placement that lasted about 2 weeks in February. We weren't placed together, but would occasionally bump into each other on breaks or while grabbing a coffee. On the last day of our placement we had a long chat for a few hours about our career history and goals, and went our separate ways. Since then, we've spoken on the phone twice and messaged a handful of times. We've not met in person since February. Basically, I don't consider her a close enough friend for her to share intimate details of her life to me and I only think of her as a colleague.

This morning I was on my phone and out of the blue, she sends me this paragraph of a traumatic event that happened to her last week that involved an assault. Obviously I feel terrible for her and wish her the best but I haven't responded to her yet because I've no clue what to do with this information. she doesn't ask for advice or anything in this text, she just told me that it happened. We don't currently work together and we have never spoken about anything except work before.

My question is, how do I address this? I've had issues in the past with friends over sharing when I've been unprepared to receive someone else's trauma, but this was with close friends so it was easier to talk to them about it. I'm just so confused as to why she would tell this to me of all people, surely there are other people in her life that are close enough for her to unload this type of thing onto?? It made me so uncomfortable to just be told about something so terrible first thing in the morning by someone I barely speak to.",1,1748513471.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1ky732q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amenorrhearecovery/comments/1ky732q/success/,Success :),"Hi all, yesterday I got my period, being all in since 3-4 months ago. I had lost it in March of 2024 due to disordered eating. I had regained it in July of that year due to gaining some weight after having extreme hunger, but lost it because I continued with my ways, eventually joining the gym and going overboard. Initially, I thought it was just stress (which may be partly true because I had some traumatic events), then I got diagnosed with PCOS by my first doctor (which made my actions even more disordered, going harder in the gym and losing myself completely). I finally did visit another doctor in January of this year and he told me my endometrium is too thin to have a period. Initially, I opened up about just my anxiety problems and he told me I need to chill out and come back in a while and see how I am doing. At that point, I had been gaslighting myself very hard, that it's just chronic stress, that I had PCOS, that I have other problems... Never once addressing the main issue. The second time, he presribed me progesterone to trigger a bleed and wanted to put me on 6 months birth control. I bought them and they have been sitting in my bag for three months because I refused to take them. 

I will tell you what I did - but take it with a grain of salt, we don't all have the same organism and what my body needed might not be the same that yours needs - although the same two points stand - eating more and exercising less.

¬∞ When I started, I had extreme hunger, eating every 1-2 hours, stuffing food in my face because it felt like my life depended on it. My body was RAVENOUS.

¬∞ Continued weight lifting for a while. I did not want to see my body changing and all the work I put in to just fade away. 

¬∞ My hunger subsided but I made sure to eat extra. Sometimes even past fullness but not so uncomfortable that I felt sick. 

¬∞ I tried to keep my blood sugar stable, eating balanced and nourishing meals BUT I never said no to any fast food, chocolates, muffins, crisps... Anything that I had been restricting. For a while all I wanted to eat was pastries and so I did. The cravings subsided after a while.
 
¬∞ I ate every single time I was hungry, whether it be boredom or actual hunger. If I felt a little bit hungry I ate whatever and however much I was craving for.

¬∞ I ate as soon as I woke up because I'd wake up extremely hungry and still do.

¬∞ I cut out coffee. Personally I don't think this is necessary for all but coffee was aggravating me and making it harder for me. 

¬∞ After a while, I had to reduce exercise because I had exams, I had no time to go but what I found out is that I was repulsed. When I had time, I did not want to go. Emotionally, it made me anxious and deep down I knew that it's not good and it might be hindering my progress. So I stopped. It was fine for the first few weeks, then I got scared about my body, the way it was gonna look with no muscle and extra fluff and my brain was SCREAMING at me. But I chose to ignore it and do other stuff instead. I stopped 7 weeks ago.

¬∞ I took calming herbal meds for panic.

¬∞ THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I DID: I worked on my body image issues, where they stem from, why I am doing what I am doing, what is missing in my life - fixing this helped me not only with my relationship with food but my overall outlook on life. I stopped running everywhere, doing everything, aiming for perfection in every aspect of my life. I am not perfect but I try to keep myself in check. I journaled, researched, did art, read more.. anything that made me feel good and made me relax and put the pieces together.

I felt very responsible and wanted to take responsibility for this, and so I did. It was so uncomfortable, I cried ALOT, got agitated alot, had countless fights with those around me - until one day it clicked and things fell into place mentally for me. The physical stuff followed. Yes, I did gain weight and now I don't care anymore because my body is cycling again which is the most important for me. All the other stuff is just secondary.

Thank you to everyone on this subreddit, you guys are great :) I know how isolating it is and I'm sure you all do too - that's why I think this subreddit and other support groups are so so so important. Never hesitate to reach out to people who understand you. My DMs are open if you want to talk about it, ask me some questions or just whatever!

1ky72y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/underTheSurfaceis/comments/1ky72y8/figured_out_why_some_compliments_feel_genuine_and/,Figured out why some compliments feel genuine and others don't,"Ever notice how sometimes a compliment can hit you straight in the feels, but other times it feels like they're just blowing smoke? üôÉ I've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially because I had an encounter this weekend that left me scratching my head.

So, I'm at this coffee shop, right? Just relaxing with my latte when this dude tells me he loves my hoodie. Now, I've been told that before and it usually feels nice, but this time it felt weirdly flat, like he was just being polite or something. It got me wondering... what makes the difference?

Later that day, my friend complimented my laugh. She said it makes people happy even on their crappiest days, and that got me all warm and fuzzy inside. It was kinda striking just how different the two comments felt, even though they both seemed sincere in the moment. ü§î

I wonder if it's all about context or maybe the relationship you have with the person? Like, when my friend said it, I could sense a shared history and understanding behind her words, which made it feel so much more... real? Could it be that genuine compliments carry some unspoken backstory that enhances their impact? And when that's missing, it just falls flat?

I'm starting to suspect it might also tie back to past experiences. Maybe certain types of praise remind me of encouraging moments from my childhood or something. Who knows, maybe the hidden piece is all about trust and connection, or even how we perceive the sincerity behind someone‚Äôs intentions.

Anyway, I guess it‚Äôs one of those mysteries of human interaction that keeps things interesting. I'm curious to hear if anyone else has noticed a similar vibe in their own lives. üéà",2,1748513399.0,underTheSurfaceis,0,1.0,False

This is a video of Barista Alan Jarrar dialling in 3 different coffees and in my view is the best dial in video on YouTube.

What to note from this is that;

1. He doesn't change his dose or water temp throughout the video. He keeps it simple 
2. He starts each shot with a goal - ""I'm looking for Xg in X seconds - He doesn't make these up, he bases it in the coffee he's using. This is the perfect illustration of why dialling is espresso is a dynamic skill that takes experience to get good at.
3. He tastes everything and makes adjustments based on taste, not on failure to hit arbitrary metrics. Again, this showcases why experience is required and how much there is to learn in espresso.
4. He sets a new goal based on the taste and adjusts to achieve it. Again, he's not just saying, ""too fast, needs to be slower"". He's tasting and asking what's missing.

It's just a great live example of what dialling in espresso actually is. Also a great reminder that if you don't taste a shot, you can't say what needs to change.",3,1748513049.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1ky6zmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ky6zmx/many_consumer_products_are_the_outcome_of/,Many consumer products are the outcome of exploiting the environment and people in the global South,"According to phys.org:

These ways of managing people and nature continue to this day. Many industries still rely on the extraction of natural resources at low cost and in large quantities in the countries of the global south.

Rubber is not the only resource whose exploitation dates to the Industrial Revolution: palm oil, sugar, coffee and cocoa have also had, and still have, an impact on the forests of the global south and are based on the work of local people. The exploitation of these resources is also often the fruit of colonial history.

According to fool49:

The developed world has been taking advantage of the developing world, to extract resources, like rubber and sugar. Destroying their environment and communities. This started with the industrial revolution, and continues today. Especially in South America, Asia, and Africa. These countries should take back ownership of the plantations and mines, from private foreign companies, and form global cartels. So they can negotiate higher prices for their commodities, and protect their land and people.

The success of the Western capitalist model, is built on subjugation of the people in the global south. And deforestation and pollution of their local environment.

1ky6y8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ky6y8a/ive_been_working_as_a_photographer_for_stock/,I've been working as a photographer for stock photos and I think the models don't exist,"I have been working as a free-lance photographer on and off since I was in high school. It started off as a way to make money on the side but as my portfolio casually grew I began to land bigger jobs.



Now I am a college graduate and I have been pursuing a professional photography career more seriously. For the past few months I have been doing jobs for companies that produce stock footage and photos.



Funny enough, I had never considered there was really a market for that, but thinking about it now, I suppose it makes sense. However, I had an experience with one of the subjects of a recent shoot that has turned me off of doing any jobs for a long time. Just thinking about what happened to me is making me feel nauseous and just anxious, but I have to share it. It is just so damn strange.



For the past few weeks I had been doing shoots with a group of models at a studio in my area. I never understood the prompts for the photos, but I never questioned it because I was being paid. I took photos of the models in generic clothes doing various poses, holding random objects, and acting out oddly specific scenarios. I always wondered who were the people buying these stock images and why?



On the last shoot, about a week ago, one of the models approached me afterwards and very forwardly asked me to dinner. She was wearing a grey t-shirt with blue jeans and brandless white tennis shoes. Her hair was tightly pulled back in a ponytail, and now that I think about it, I cannot recall much of her facial features. I just remember thinking she was an attractive and kind woman.



The way she spoke to me was a bit odd however. Her phrases were very short, uninteresting, and unnatural, but I assumed maybe it was just because of the odd nature of a stock photo shoot. I always thought there was something kind of eerie about the lifelessness of the photos we took. They were all completely devoid of any human elements. It was almost like the people in the photos we took were not meant to be seen as real.



Anyway, I obliged because, honestly, since college I had not dated much. She gave me her number, and that was the first real odd thing I noticed about her. The area code was not the same as the area code we lived in, and looking the code up, I could not find for which state the area code was for. It was seemingly for a non-existent state.



I sent her a text when I got home to confirm her number.



‚ÄúHey, this is Blake. Is this Jane?‚Äù



She only took a few minutes to reply.



‚ÄúHey, Blake. This is Jane. How does dinner at my place this Friday sound? Does 7pm work?‚Äù



I was kind of thrown off by the idea of having dinner at her place, but I reasoned that was not such a weird thing, and I honestly found the idea endearing. I confirmed the plans and after that we did not text much.



Eventually Friday came and I asked for her address, which she provided, and before I knew it I was making the drive. She lived a surprising distance outside of town and when I put her address into maps, the name kept coming up as a set of coordinates.



The drive was eerily quiet, even with the radio playing. As I followed the maps, the whole atmosphere seemed off, but I did not think much of it.



When I got to her street I noticed the street was not on the map on my phone. Where there usually was a gray line, indicating a road, there was just a blank area. Yet, I saw a road, and populated houses lined it orderly. The street honestly looked a little out of place, because the surrounding houses were all spaced out and it was a pretty sparsely populated area. I just assumed maps had made an error, and turned onto the street.



Her house was at the very end of the street in a cul-de-sac. It was modest, one story, and slightly beige-colored with dark shutters. The lawn was kept, and a symmetrical flowerbed bordered the walkway up to the porch.



I texted her to let her know I was here.



‚ÄúCome on in. I‚Äôm excited to have you.‚Äù



I walked up to her front door and knocked. A light was on in the living room, and although not trying to be intrusive, I took a glance at the living room through the window.



It looked like the set of a stock photo shoot.



‚ÄúJust come on in. I will be home soon.‚Äù



She was not home? I found that immediately strange, and did not want to go inside but reluctantly I entered. The door was unlocked.



Her house was so strange. I got a better look at the living room. A blue rug, a coffee table with nothing on it, a navy couch with a lamp in the far corner. There was a TV stand, but no TV.



The walls. A sickening gray with framed photos. I looked closer at them, and realized they still had the placeholder photos in them.



To the left of the entryway. A room with a dining table. A singular house plant in the corner. Sitting on the center of the dining room table was an empty bowl.



The whole house smelled like the warehouse section of a supermarket. At this point I was starting to feel uneasy. I decided to take a seat on the couch.



Somewhere in the depths of the house I heard a clock ticking hypnotically.



I did not even get on my phone to pass the time waiting for her, I just sat there soaking up the entirely strange house, devoid of any personality. I stared at the pointless TV stand. The sun was starting to set.



She sent me a text.



‚ÄúHey, Blake. This is Jane. How does dinner at my place this Friday sound? Does 7pm work?‚Äù



What? I chalked it up to a messaging error.



‚ÄúHey, Blake. This is Jane. How does dinner at my place this Friday sound? Does 7pm work?‚Äù



Something about the second time seeing the message was too much. I went to the living room window looking out it, hoping to see her car headlights heading down the street.



Her car was in the driveway and it was off. I remembered, it had been there the whole time. I then was overcome with the horrible feeling of eyes on my back. A chill coiled up my spine and I immediately felt sick. I turned.



Through the living room was a side hallway. She was standing there. Although shrouded in darkness, I knew her eyes were fixed on me. The feeling was so malicious, so menacing, I began to heave. I left frantically out of her front door, I got to my car, and got the hell away from her house.



As I was pulling out of her driveway, I saw her figure move past the living room windows with an uncanny speed, yet her body remained stiff. She was at the front door, looking through the glass. Her eyes had never left me.



I actually ended up driving to a friend's house to stay the night. He was very kind to have me on such short notice, and I explained everything to him. He‚Äôs a good friend for not thinking I am crazy. In fact he helped me search for her socials using the photos from our shoot as a reference.



We did find her. We found the whole damn group of models. We could only find their photos on one website though, and just thinking about it makes me queasy.

Yesterday I got one final message from her.

150 years ago, as today, the East African Arabica bean was prized for its superior flavor. Yet its vulnerability to rust disease drove planters to seek hardier and, in effect, less aromatic alternatives. West African Liberica was initially seen as the solution‚Äîbut it was the Central African Robusta that ultimately reshaped global production due to its resilience and yield.  
  
By the late 1800s, Brazil had already become the world‚Äôs leading coffee producer, followed by the Indonesian archipelago, India, and parts of Central America. Notably, key players today‚Äîlike Kenya, Vietnam, and Peru‚Äîwere not yet part of the global supply chain.   
  
As with other global commodities of the 19th century, merchants and travelers wrote extensively about where the best and worst coffee came from. Some of those stories are the basis for this map.

1ky6xdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeCommunity/comments/1ky6xdi/cloud_hosting_vs_dedicated_hosting/,Cloud Hosting vs Dedicated Hosting,"Your website traffic is climbing, your team is growing, and suddenly you're faced with a decision that could make or break your online presence. Should you go with cloud hosting or stick with the tried-and-true dedicated server route?

I've been down this road myself, and let me tell you ‚Äì it's one of those decisions that keeps you up at night. You're not just choosing a hosting solution; you're essentially picking the foundation that'll support your entire digital empire. Make the wrong choice, and you could end up with a slow website, frustrated customers, or worse ‚Äì a hosting bill that makes your accountant cry.

But here's the thing that most people don't realize: there's no one-size-fits-all answer. What works for your buddy's e-commerce store might be completely wrong for your SaaS startup. The hosting landscape in 2025 has evolved dramatically, and the lines between cloud and dedicated hosting have gotten surprisingly blurry.

So grab a coffee, get comfortable, and let's dive deep into this hosting battle royale. By the end of this post, you'll know exactly which option fits your business like a glove.

# Understanding the Basics: What Are We Actually Talking About?

Let's start with the fundamentals because, honestly, the hosting world loves throwing around fancy terms that can leave your head spinning.

**Cloud hosting** is like having access to a massive pool of computing resources that you can tap into whenever you need them. Instead of being hosted on physical hardware that's solely used by you, they reside in a shared ""virtualized"" environment that's managed by your cloud hosting provider. Think of it as the Uber of hosting ‚Äì you get premium resources without owning the actual hardware.

The magic happens through something called virtualization. Your website sits on multiple interconnected servers, which means if one server decides to have a bad day, another one immediately picks up the slack. It's like having a team of backup dancers ready to jump in if the lead performer trips.

**Dedicated hosting**, on the other hand, is more like owning your own personal race car. A dedicated server is a physical server that is purchased or rented entirely for your own business needs. Every single resource on that machine ‚Äì the CPU, RAM, storage, bandwidth ‚Äì belongs to you and you alone. No sharing, no compromising, no weird neighbors using up all the bandwidth streaming Netflix.

The key difference? Cloud hosting gives you flexibility and shared resources, while dedicated hosting gives you raw power and complete control. It's the difference between renting a luxury apartment in a high-rise versus buying your own house.

# Performance Showdown: Speed, Power, and Reliability

Now let's talk about what really matters ‚Äì performance. Because at the end of the day, nobody cares how cool your hosting setup sounds if your website loads slower than molasses in January.

When it comes to raw performance, dedicated servers usually take the lead. This makes sense when you think about it ‚Äì you've got exclusive access to all the server resources. No other websites are competing for CPU cycles or hogging the RAM. It's like having a private highway during rush hour.

But here's where it gets interesting. Cloud hosting has seriously upped its game in recent years. Unlike shared hosting, where resources are divided among many users, Cloud VPS provides dedicated resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. This ensures that your website or application maintains consistent performance, even during peak traffic.

The reliability factor is where cloud hosting really shines. Cloud VPS services are typically built on a network of interconnected servers. If one server goes down, another seamlessly takes over, ensuring high availability and minimal downtime. With dedicated servers, if your hardware fails, you're basically stuck until it gets fixed or replaced.

Here's a personal example: I once had a dedicated server that crashed during Black Friday (Murphy's Law, right?). While my hosting provider scrambled to fix the hardware, I watched potential sales disappear. Meanwhile, my friend running on cloud hosting didn't even notice when one of his underlying servers failed because the system automatically shifted everything to healthy servers.

However, for applications that demand absolute peak performance ‚Äì like high-frequency trading platforms or massive gaming servers ‚Äì dedicated hosting still holds the crown. If performance is critical for your business, dedicated servers are the preferred choice, offering fast processing and direct data access.

# The Money Talk: Breaking Down the Real Costs

Let's be brutally honest about costs because this is where most people get caught off guard. The pricing models for cloud and dedicated hosting are completely different animals, which makes comparing them tricky.

**Cloud Hosting Costs:** Cloud hosting typically uses a pay-as-you-go model. The pricing plans for Hostinger cloud hosting cost $7.99 to $29.99/month, but this can vary significantly based on usage. Here's what you need to consider:

|Resource|Typical Cost Range|
|:-|:-|
|Basic Cloud VPS|$10-30/month|
|Mid-tier Cloud|$30-100/month|
|Enterprise Cloud|$100-500+/month|
|CloudWays Managed|$11-35/month starting|

The beauty of cloud pricing is that you only pay for what you use. Traffic spike during a product launch? The cost scales up. Quiet month? Your bill shrinks accordingly. But here's the catch ‚Äì heavy utilization costs with a popular cloud host can exceed the costs of dedicated servers over time.

**Dedicated Hosting Costs:** Dedicated servers work differently. Dedicated hosting prices are the highest, ranging from $80-500/month. But unlike cloud hosting, you know exactly what you're paying every month.

|Server Type|Monthly Cost Range|
|:-|:-|
|Entry-level Dedicated|$80-150/month|
|Mid-range Dedicated|$150-300/month|
|High-performance Dedicated|$300-1000+/month|
|Enterprise Dedicated|$1000+/month|

The hidden costs matter too. With dedicated hosting, you might need to budget for:

* Hardware replacement and upgrades
* Technical support (unless it's managed)
* Backup solutions
* Security software and monitoring

Cloud hosting usually includes most of these services, but you'll pay for them through higher per-resource costs.

I learned this lesson the hard way when I switched from a $200/month dedicated server to what I thought was a $50/month cloud solution. After three months of heavy traffic, my cloud bill hit $380. Ouch.

# Scalability: Growing with Your Business

This is where cloud hosting absolutely crushes the competition. If your business experiences variable traffic, cloud hosting allows you to scale resources up or down based on real-time needs.

Imagine you're running an online store and suddenly your product goes viral on TikTok. With cloud hosting, your server automatically scales up to handle the traffic surge. You might pay more that month, but your website stays online and continues making sales. With dedicated hosting? You're probably scrambling to upgrade your server while watching potential customers bounce off your overloaded site.

Dedicated servers require careful planning and additional resources for upgrades, potentially leading to downtime. When you need more power, you either have to physically upgrade your existing server (which requires downtime) or migrate to a new, more powerful machine (which requires even more downtime and planning).

But here's a nuance most people miss: if your traffic is consistently high and predictable, dedicated hosting can actually be more cost-effective for scaling. You're not paying premium prices for the flexibility you don't really need.

# Security and Control: Who's Really in Charge?

Security is where things get really interesting, and where personal preference plays a huge role.

With **dedicated hosting**, you're the master of your domain. You control every aspect of security ‚Äì from the operating system level up to the applications. This is fantastic if you have specific compliance requirements or unique security needs. You can customize firewalls, install whatever security software you want, and lock down the server exactly how you prefer.

But here's the flip side ‚Äì you're also responsible for maintaining all that security. Miss a critical security patch? That's on you. Misconfigure a firewall rule? Also on you.

**Cloud hosting** takes a different approach. With isolated environments, your data and applications are better protected from potential threats. Enhanced security features, such as dedicated IP addresses and the ability to install custom security software, further safeguard your operations.

Most cloud providers handle the underlying infrastructure security, which means they're patching servers, monitoring for threats, and maintaining physical security at their data centers. You still need to secure your applications and data, but the foundational security is handled for you.

It's important to understand whether your business's security plan requires a single-tenant environment. If you're handling extremely sensitive data or have strict compliance requirements, the isolation of dedicated hosting might be non-negotiable.

# Management: DIY vs. Managed Solutions

Here's where we need to talk about the elephant in the room ‚Äì technical expertise. Both cloud and dedicated hosting can be self-managed, but they require different skill sets.

Managing a dedicated server is like being a car mechanic ‚Äì you need to understand how all the parts work together. You're responsible for:

* Operating system maintenance and updates
* Security patching and monitoring
* Hardware troubleshooting
* Performance optimization
* Backup management

Cloud hosting management is more like being a race car driver ‚Äì you focus on performance and optimization while someone else handles the mechanical details. The cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure, but you still need to manage your applications and data.

This is where managed hosting solutions really shine. Companies like CloudWays bridge this gap by providing managed cloud hosting that handles the technical complexity while giving you the benefits of cloud infrastructure.

# Real-World Use Cases: When to Choose What

Let me share some real scenarios to help illustrate when each option makes sense.

**Go with Cloud Hosting if:**

* You're a growing startup with unpredictable traffic
* You need to launch quickly and iterate fast
* Your team lacks deep server administration skills
* You want predictable monthly costs that scale with usage
* You're building a SaaS application with variable user loads

**Choose Dedicated Hosting if:**

* You're running resource-intensive applications (like video processing or large databases)
* You have consistent, high-traffic levels
* You need maximum performance and can't tolerate any resource sharing
* You have specific compliance requirements that demand dedicated infrastructure
* You have the technical expertise to manage servers effectively

**Real Example:** One of my clients runs a video streaming platform. They started with cloud hosting, but as their user base grew to millions of hours streamed monthly, the cloud costs became astronomical. They switched to dedicated servers and cut their hosting costs by 60% while actually improving performance. But their smaller competitors who have sporadic traffic? They're still better off with cloud hosting.

Another client runs an e-commerce site with massive seasonal spikes during holidays. Cloud hosting lets them scale up their resources during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, then scale back down during quiet periods. This flexibility saves them thousands annually compared to paying for dedicated resources they only need 10% of the time.

# CloudWays: The Sweet Spot Solution

Now, let me introduce you to what might be the perfect middle ground ‚Äì CloudWays. This is where things get really interesting because CloudWays essentially gives you the best of both worlds.

Cloudways turbocharges your digital agency, eCommerce store, or online business with a fast, secure, and simple cloud hosting platform, backed by 24/7 support. What makes CloudWays special is that they're not just another hosting provider ‚Äì they're a managed platform that sits on top of major cloud providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, Google Cloud, Vultr, and Linode.

Here's what this means for you: You get the scalability and reliability of enterprise cloud infrastructure, but with the simplicity of traditional hosting. Cloudways pricing starts from $14/mo. Affordable cloud hosting plans built on top of DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, and AWS cloud providers.

**Why CloudWays Makes Sense:**

* **Managed Infrastructure**: They handle all the server management, security patching, and monitoring
* **Multiple Cloud Options**: Choose from 5 different cloud providers based on your needs and budget
* **Easy Scaling**: Scale resources up or down with a few clicks
* **Developer-Friendly**: Built-in staging environments, Git integration, and performance monitoring
* **24/7 Support**: Expert engineers available around the clock

Cloudways uses five IaaS providers for server deployment. Pricing changes are per the backed cloud Provider. This flexibility means you can start with a budget-friendly DigitalOcean setup and move to AWS or Google Cloud as you grow.

The pricing is transparent and fair. For example, CloudWays DigitalOcean standard server pricing starts at $10/Month, and their premium server starts at $12/Month. With a standard DigitalOcean server, you get 1GB RAM, 1 Core Processor, 25GB SSD Storage, & 1TB Bandwidth.

What I particularly love about CloudWays is their real-time billing. If you run the server for less than a month, you will be charged only for the server running hours. This makes testing and development incredibly cost-effective.

# 2025 Trends and Future Outlook

The hosting landscape is evolving rapidly, and 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. Gartner projects that worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services will hit nearly $600 billion, up from $500 billion in 2023.

**Key Trends We're Seeing:**

1. **Hybrid Approaches**: Hybrid hosting solutions are becoming increasingly popular ‚Äî combining the strengths of both approaches. You might run critical applications on dedicated infrastructure while using the cloud for backups or non-essential services.
2. **Edge Computing**: More businesses are pushing computing closer to their users, which is blurring the lines between cloud and dedicated hosting.
3. **Sustainability Focus**: Environmental concerns are driving more companies toward cloud solutions that can optimize resource usage across multiple tenants.
4. **AI-Powered Management**: Automated scaling, security, and optimization are becoming standard features rather than premium add-ons.

The bottom line? The future isn't about choosing between cloud or dedicated hosting ‚Äì it's about choosing the right mix of both for your specific needs.

# Making Your Decision: A Simple Framework

Here's a straightforward framework I use when helping clients choose:

**Start with these questions:**

1. Is your traffic predictable or highly variable?
2. Do you have the technical expertise to manage servers?
3. What's your budget for both initial setup and ongoing costs?
4. How critical is maximum performance vs. flexibility?
5. Do you have specific compliance or security requirements?

**If you answered:**

* Variable traffic + Limited expertise + Flexible budget = **Cloud Hosting**
* Predictable traffic + Technical expertise + Performance-critical = **Dedicated Hosting**
* Want the best of both + Prefer managed solutions = **CloudWays or similar managed cloud**

# The Bottom Line

Choosing between cloud hosting and dedicated hosting isn't really about picking the ""better"" option ‚Äì it's about picking the right option for your specific situation. Both have their place in the hosting ecosystem, and both can be the perfect choice depending on your needs.

Cloud hosting excels when you need flexibility, quick deployment, and don't want to deal with server management. Dedicated hosting wins when you need maximum performance, have predictable resource needs, and want complete control.

But here's my honest recommendation: if you're unsure, start with a managed cloud solution like CloudWays. You'll get the benefits of cloud infrastructure without the complexity, and you can always migrate to dedicated hosting later if your needs change. The flexibility to scale and the peace of mind that comes with expert management make it an ideal solution for most businesses in 2025.

Remember, your hosting choice isn't permanent. As your business grows and evolves, your hosting needs will too. The key is choosing a solution that gives you room to grow and the flexibility to adapt. Whether that's cloud, dedicated, or a managed hybrid approach, make sure it aligns with your current needs while keeping future possibilities open.

The hosting wars between cloud and dedicated aren't really wars at all ‚Äì they're just different tools for different jobs. Choose the right tool, and your business will thrive regardless of which path you take.",1,1748512817.0,NoCodeCommunity,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúElla, hurry up or you‚Äôre going to be late for school!‚Äù This is the second time my mother has yelled upstairs for me, but I just sit here, on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall.

I tell myself that it‚Äôs going to be a good day, but who am I kidding? I haven‚Äôt had a good day at school in two years. Only six more months left of my senior year, and then it will be all over. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it yet, and that‚Äôs the most messed up part. I‚Äôm eighteen years old, about to graduate high school, and I have a full scholarship to pretty much any college I want to go.

My name is Ella Baxter and I‚Äôm a nerd who has no friends, I never break any rules, and I have a deep need to please everyone, but myself. I haven‚Äôt always been this way, but circumstances bring on change, and for me, it was not for the better. I used to have a lot of friends; two of them being my best friends, Amy and Bree. We were inseparable throughout middle school and junior high. It wasn‚Äôt until the beginning of sophomore year when I had to distance myself from everyone in my life except for my family.

‚ÄúHoney! Are you coming down or not?‚Äù Once again, my mother‚Äôs voice reaches me. Sighing, I reach down, grabbing my backpack, and head down before mom has a coronary.

I paste a smile on my face as I round the corner to the kitchen, where my younger sister and brother sit with a bowl of cereal. Eli, my nine-year-old brother has his bowl tipped back as he slurps the milk out. Meanwhile, my fifteen-year-old sister, Elise, is dripping milk on the table every time she spoons the cereal into her mouth because her eyes are glue to her cellphone. This is an everyday occurrence in the Baxter household.

I roll my eyes and lean down, giving my dad a kiss on his cheek, ‚ÄúGood morning, daddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning, sweetie, did you oversleep again?‚Äù His concern for my wellbeing is written all over his face. I‚Äôve always been his little girl, and it shows in the way he babies me over everything. I don‚Äôt complain though, because I need all the love and attention that I can get these days.

‚ÄúNo, daddy.‚Äù I don‚Äôt add anything else, but I do smile at him. I could have lied and made something up, but again, I‚Äôm a goodie goodie; I would never lie to my parents. He only hesitates a moment before going back to his newspaper.

Taking my seat beside my dad, my mother sets my two slices of peanut butter toast and a banana down in front of me. Unlike my siblings, I‚Äôm not a fan of cold cereal. I prefer something more substantial in my stomach before starting a grueling day at school.

‚ÄúThis is the third day in a row that I had to holler for you to come down more than once, Ella,‚Äù Mom takes her place across from me, on my father‚Äôs other side, as she sips her black coffee, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt make it a habit, my throat is starting to hurt.‚Äù

My father chuckles behind his paper, earning himself a slap on the arm from his wife, ‚ÄúBehave, Ethan!‚Äù

I‚Äôve been around my parents enough to know how they are. They are both in their early forties, and still have their good looks. Unfortunately, they also still have a high sex drive, so I can only imagine what my dad‚Äôs chuckle was insinuating. Being around them every day, you get used to it. Besides, I think it‚Äôs so cute that, even after all these years, they are still madly in love with one another. I hope I find a love like theirs in my lifetime.

‚ÄúOh! Before I forget,‚Äù Mom turns back to me, ‚ÄúI have a PTA meeting at Eli‚Äôs school this evening. I‚Äôll have a casserole in the oven but will need you to make sure your brother and sister eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, no problem.‚Äù My mom is always volunteering here and there, and she is the head of the PTA, so she is always busy with that. ‚ÄúWill you be home for supper, dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, honey. I have a meeting with a client, and it may run late. Just put a plate in the warmer for me if I don‚Äôt make it in time.‚Äù I nod. My dad is a partner at his Law Firm, so it‚Äôs no surprise when he doesn‚Äôt make it home on time. Sometimes my mom will bring dinner to him and his client if the meeting runs over.

Finishing up the last of my breakfast, I take my plate to the dishwasher and then scoop my bag up, ‚ÄúThe train is leaving!‚Äù I call out to Eli and Elise. Driving them to school every morning is our little morning ritual. It‚Äôs the only time that we get with each other these days. Elise is always busy with her friends, now that she‚Äôs a freshman, and Eli locks himself in his room and plays video games all evening.

As soon as we get into the car, Elise cranks up the radio, and our morning karaoke session begins. Ed Sheeran‚Äôs song, Shivers, my sister‚Äôs favorite song, is playing, and she squeals. She starts to dance as she belts out the words, and I can‚Äôt help but to laugh as I watch her strawberry blonde curls bounce around. Her blue eyes sparkle when they find mine, and she gives me a big smile. Unlike some sisters, we actually get along very well, but it‚Äôs times like this that I envy her innocence. I hope she never has to experience a day of what my life is like, because I‚Äôm afraid it may break her.

The second bell that starts the first class of the day is about to ring as I slam my locker closed. With my laptop bag slung across my body, I quickly make my way to my first class before anybody can stop me. Mr. Miller, our math teacher, sits at his desk, shuffling through papers while we all file into the room. I breathe a sigh of relief once my butt touches my chair, knowing that for the next ninety minutes, I‚Äôll have some semblance of peace.

Unfortunately, Mr. Miller had us working on our next assignment, which kept me busy through the whole class, and before I know it, the bell rings. Packing my laptop away, I turn to leave and accidentally bump into someone, I curse under my breath when I see who it is.

‚ÄúWatch where you‚Äôre going, nerd!‚Äù Kaylee Simpson glares at me as though I had done it on purpose.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.‚Äù She mimics and then shoves past me, ‚ÄúHow about you accidentally jump off a bridge?‚Äù Her friend, Callie, snickers at her lame attempt to insult me as they walk out.

Bumping into the captain of the school‚Äôs dance team first thing in the morning pretty much tells me exactly what kind of day I‚Äôm going to have. Kaylee doesn‚Äôt even know why she hates me so much. We used to be acquaintances, not really running in the same crowd, but still talking between classes and outside of school. Now she treats me like the dirt under her feet. Like everybody else, she dropped me like last season‚Äôs fashion line two years ago. One Friday night we were talking at a friend‚Äôs party, and then come Monday morning, Kaylee and most of the senior class started to ignore me. It had only taken about a week, and then the rest of the school abandoned me as well.

Naturally, I asked, ‚Äú*Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?*‚Äù

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

1ky6w43,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpertSays/comments/1ky6w43/ninja_creami_ice_cream_gamechanger_or_overrated/,Ninja Creami: Ice Cream Game-Changer or Overrated Blender? A Full Consumer Breakdown,"The Ninja Creami took over TikTok with a promise that felt too good to be true: ‚ÄúTurn almost anything into ice cream at home.‚Äù Overnight oats? Protein shakes? Leftover coffee? Just freeze it in a pint and let the Creami do the work.

But behind the flashy videos and viral recipes, there‚Äôs a real question:

**Is the Ninja Creami worth buying or is it just a loud, bulky, single-use gimmick?**

Let‚Äôs break it down fully, in real terms how it works, how it *actually* performs, and what real users are saying.

#  What the Ninja Creami Actually Does

The Creami isn‚Äôt a traditional ice cream maker. It doesn‚Äôt churn a cold liquid into a frozen dessert the way a machine like the Cuisinart does.

Instead, here‚Äôs how it works:

* You mix your base (could be milk, protein shake, fruit puree, yogurt, etc.) and pour it into a pint container.
* You freeze that container **solid** usually for 24 hours.
* Then, you ‚Äúspin‚Äù it in the Creami, which uses a sharp, high-speed blade to shave through the frozen block until it becomes smooth, scoopable, and creamy.

This process isn‚Äôt churning  it‚Äôs **micro-shearing**. And it‚Äôs surprisingly effective. It can take a block of frozen protein shake and turn it into something that feels like gelato.

But it comes with some quirks.

# Freeze-Then-Spin: A Strength and a Weakness

The 24-hour freeze time is key. You can‚Äôt just make a base and enjoy it 30 minutes later. If you're craving ice cream *now*, the Creami isn‚Äôt going to help.

This delay is the biggest drawback for new users especially those used to instant gratification.

However, once you get in the rhythm of always having a pint or two in the freezer, the system becomes much more convenient. You can prep three or four pints ahead of time and mix-and-match when the craving hits.

That said, it‚Äôs not fast. A full spin cycle can take several minutes, and the noise  more on that later  isn‚Äôt subtle.

#  Texture: Can It Really Compete with Real Ice Cream?

This is where the Creami surprises people especially with the right base.

If you use high-fat, dairy-heavy recipes, the result is almost indistinguishable from soft-serve ice cream. Even lighter recipes almond milk, oat milk, or yogurt can get remarkably close to sorbet or frozen yogurt textures.

But consistency depends on:

* Your base (thicker = better)
* The freeze duration (too short = icy shards)
* Whether you use the **Re-spin function**

Many users need to run their pint **twice** to get the full creamy texture ‚Äî once for initial shaving, and again to refine the mix. This is especially true for high-protein or low-fat mixes.

# High-Protein Ice Cream: A Real Use Case, Not a Gimmick

Here‚Äôs where the Creami becomes more than a fun gadget: people use it to make **protein-packed desserts** that would otherwise taste chalky or bland.

By freezing a protein shake with a banana or Greek yogurt and spinning it, you can make a dessert that tastes like a cheat day  with 40g of protein and zero added sugar.

This makes it especially popular among:

* Fitness enthusiasts
* People on high-protein or low-sugar diets (e.g. bariatric patients)
* Diabetics who need dessert alternatives

It‚Äôs not just about fun  for some, it‚Äôs a legit nutrition tool.

#  Noise and Build Quality: Not Exactly Subtle

One of the biggest complaints about the Creami is **noise**. When spinning, it sounds closer to a NutriBullet than a countertop ice cream maker. It‚Äôs loud, mechanical, and not something you‚Äôd use during a phone call.

The machine itself is solidly built but **bulky**. It takes up counter space and only does one thing ‚Äî spin pints of frozen mix. If you have a small kitchen, this could be a dealbreaker.

Also, the machine uses **proprietary pint containers**, and people often want extras to batch-freeze. Ninja sells these separately, but they‚Äôre often overpriced or out of stock.

# Is It Worth the Price?

The standard Ninja Creami retails around **$199**, while the deluxe version runs closer to **$229‚Äì$249**. For a single-purpose machine, that‚Äôs a lot.

But for many users, it‚Äôs not about replacing store-bought ice cream , it‚Äôs about **control**.

You control the:

* Sugar
* Fat
* Protein
* Ingredients (no gums, no corn syrup, no allergens)

For families with dietary needs, food allergies, or athletes with strict macros, this level of control is worth the price. But if you just want something cold and creamy every now and then? A $5 pint from the freezer aisle is still simpler.

#  The Learning Curve and Community Hacks

Like the Dyson Airwrap, the Creami has a learning curve. At first, it‚Äôs easy to make overly icy or bland desserts. But once you start experimenting ‚Äî and tap into Reddit, Facebook groups, and YouTube recipes ‚Äî the potential expands fast.

People are using the Creami to make:

* Protein ice cream from Fairlife shakes
* Keto frozen coffee
* Avocado-based mousse
* Fruit-only sorbets
* Boozy slushies and ‚Äúadult desserts‚Äù

The DIY creativity is half the fun.

#  Is It a Gimmick or a Keeper?

**The Ninja Creami is not for everyone.**

If you're a casual ice cream fan who enjoys a treat once in a while, this machine is overkill.

But if you're someone who:

* Likes experimenting in the kitchen
* Has dietary restrictions or fitness goals
* Enjoys controlling ingredients
* Doesn't mind a bit of prep

...then it might be one of the most fun, flexible, and useful appliances you'll own.

About one week ago, I sync'ed my iphone to my computer to back it up. In the process of syncing the iphone on itunes, it proceeded to delete my 6000 songs that I've been building since 2011. It deleted my ringtone and alarm which had also been songs as well. However the most irritating part is having to wake up to the default alarm as I do not remember the name of the song or the lyrics. So I need assistance to find the name of this song.  
  
I have tried humming the start of the song into the google search, asked chatgpt to find my song based on my criteria and tried multiple apps to find this one song - and no luck, so I have turned to find help here. 

Some criteria that could help find the name of the song:   
Japanese song released between 2011‚Äì2020

* Performed by a female solo singer with crystal clear, high pitched vocals
* Slow and melancholic tone of song
* Original song (not a cover)
* The word ""Â§¢"" (yume) appears in the first few lines of the lyrics

150 years ago, as today, the East African Arabica bean was prized for its superior flavor. Yet its vulnerability to rust disease drove planters to seek hardier and, in effect, less aromatic alternatives. West African Liberica was initially seen as the solution‚Äîbut it was the Central African Robusta that ultimately reshaped global production due to its resilience and yield.  
  
By the late 1800s, Brazil had already become the world‚Äôs leading coffee producer, followed by the Indonesian archipelago, India, and parts of Central America. Notably, key players today‚Äîlike Kenya, Vietnam, and Peru‚Äîwere not yet part of the global supply chain.   
  
As with other global commodities of the 19th century, merchants and travelers wrote extensively about where the best and worst coffee came from. Some of those stories are the basis for this map.

However, playback is a catastrophe, unviewable, bitrate should be >200Mbps and a Coffee Lake GPU for transcoding is installed.

My gutt feeling is that the Plex iOS client is playing original 4k stream. I dont want to force transcoding on the Plex Media Server as i also use it on good TV screens and not impact my experience.

I would love to force the iOS Plex client (ultimately AppleTV shall be used) to rewuest a transcode to 1080P (i tried that but that's stuttering as well - only setting that was acceptable was 320P).

I know it‚Äôs unpopular, but I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about Christopher Hayden and the role he plays in Lorelai‚Äôs life ‚Äî and the more I rewatch Gilmore Girls, the more I believe that Christopher was always her most honest match. Not the safest, not the steadiest ‚Äî but the most real. I really think he gets a bad rap in this community that while somewhat deserved, should really be tempered. He really loved Lorelai and he really tried to be a good partner. And he really wasn't that far off!

He wasn‚Äôt perfect. He made mistakes. But he shares something with Lorelai that no one else ever could: a whole life.

I've watched the show about 30 times (really) and I've gone back and forth about him, but lately I'm thinking that he's totally underrated. 

---

1. They grew up together ‚Äî and survived together

Chris and Lorelai didn‚Äôt just date in high school. They escaped a world together. The rules, the pressure, the coldness of high society ‚Äî they both ran from it, just in different directions. And in that shared history is a bond that‚Äôs layered and lived-in in a way no other relationship on the show touches.

üì∫ Example: Season 2, Episode 6 ‚Äì ‚ÄúPresenting Lorelai Gilmore‚Äù
Christopher shows up for Rory‚Äôs debutante ball and seamlessly fits into the Gilmore world and rebels against it. He‚Äôs part of the same story Lorelai‚Äôs been trying to rewrite her whole life.


---

2. He sees her past ‚Äî and doesn‚Äôt hold it against her

Unlike Luke or Max, Christopher never tries to ‚Äúfix‚Äù Lorelai. He doesn‚Äôt judge her for being a single mom. He doesn‚Äôt see her sarcasm, impulsiveness, or coffee addiction as things to temper. He sees her exactly as she is ‚Äî because he knows her, down to her bones.

üì∫ Example: Season 2, Episode 3 ‚Äì ‚ÄúRed Light on the Wedding Night‚Äù
Their conversations have an emotional shorthand no one else gets. Lorelai is vulnerable with him in ways she rarely is elsewhere ‚Äî because he remembers her before the independence, before the inn, before Rory was even born.


---

3. He failed, but he tried ‚Äî and that‚Äôs more human than perfect

Christopher is one of the few characters in the show who grows by failing. He messes up ‚Äî missing years of Rory‚Äôs life, acting out of jealousy, reacting impulsively. But he always comes back and owns it. He doesn‚Äôt retreat into pride. He hurts ‚Äî openly. That kind of emotional transparency is rare in Stars Hollow.

üì∫ Example: Season 7, Episode 13 ‚Äì ‚ÄúI'd Rather Be in Philadelphia‚Äù
His reaction to Richard‚Äôs heart attack isn‚Äôt selfishness ‚Äî it‚Äôs fear of never being accepted, of being the outsider again. That‚Äôs not a villain. That‚Äôs a deeply insecure, deeply human man.


---

4. He always loved her ‚Äî even when it wasn‚Äôt enough

Christopher‚Äôs love for Lorelai is constant, even when messy. He never stopped seeing her as his person. Not the fantasy version of her. The real one. And that‚Äôs something she needed more than she realized.

üì∫ Example: Season 5, Episode 3 ‚Äì ‚ÄúWritten in the Stars‚Äù
He wants to be there for Rory. He offers to pay for Yale. Not to control ‚Äî just to support. Because he loves them both, even if he doesn't always know how to show it right.


---

5. With Christopher, Lorelai could be young again

There‚Äôs something about Lorelai when she‚Äôs with Christopher ‚Äî lighter, freer, more spontaneous. He reminds her not just of where she came from, but of who she used to be. And sometimes that‚Äôs exactly what someone needs. Not a savior. Not a fixer. But someone who remembers you ‚Äî and still wants to be there.

üì∫ Example: Season 2, Episode 10 ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Bracebridge Dinner‚Äù
The way they laugh. The sleigh ride. It‚Äôs not epic romance. It‚Äôs familiar. It‚Äôs real. It‚Äôs home.


---


TL;DR:

Christopher wasn‚Äôt perfect. He was flawed, impulsive, emotional ‚Äî and so was Lorelai. But he loved her fully, deeply, and forever.
Not with conditions. Not with control. But with hope ‚Äî and heart.

He may not have been the fairy tale ending. But maybe, he was the love that was most real.

---

Team Christopher? Maybe not always. But maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ he made more sense than we ever gave him credit for. üíôüì±

**Before I begin, I‚Äôd like to kindly ask that if you hold negative views about same-sex parenting or feel the need to express homophobic opinions, please refrain from commenting. This is a vulnerable and personal situation, and I‚Äôm genuinely asking for help, not hate.**

**I'm dealing with an issue and hope your insights can help me. Sorry in advance, this turned into quite a long story. I'm using a throwaway account for privacy reasons (also, not a fake AI-account for those wondering!).**

Five months ago, my partner (32F) and I (29F) became mothers to our beautiful son. My partner was the one who carried the pregnancy. I feel incredibly lucky that we‚Äôre able to become parents as two women, I know that‚Äôs not something to take for granted. At the same time, it comes with unique insecurities. I sometimes fear that people don‚Äôt see me as a ‚Äúreal‚Äù mom, or worse, that my sons sees me that way. We discussed these fears before and during the pregnancy, and I always felt supported by my partner. Important to note: it was never part of the plan for me to carry our child. I‚Äôve always wanted to be a mother, just not in the physical sense of carrying a child.

The birth went beautifully and without complications, and my partner recovered quickly. It was the most beautiful moment of my life. I was so proud of how my wife handled it, and we felt closer than ever. I also felt very connected to my son. He‚Äôs my pride and joy and I love him to bits.

When our son was born, my partner became extremely protective. In the first few weeks, almost no one was allowed to touch him. I understand that this can be driven by hormones, an instinct stronger than yourself, but it created some difficult situations. At every visit, my wife was the one holding our baby while I served coffee. When my parents came over, I wanted to hold him, but my wife held on to him and I had to ask directly. Even then, she handed him over shortly and reluctantly. My parents weren‚Äôt allowed to hold or really touch him, which hurt, especially because my mother-in-law had held him dozens of times and had been there the day he was born. The nurse holding him was also never an issue. For context: my wife has a good relationship with my parents.

My mother-in-law came over every day for a couple of weeks. I truly appreciated her, she did the shopping, but at some point, I started missing my own people. My mother-in-law would often lie in our bed holding our son in her arms while I had to keep my loved ones at a distance. One day I even hold him less than my mother-in-law. I also noticed in those early weeks that my wife sometimes struggled to hand our son over to me. Again, I get that hormones may play a role, and I didn‚Äôt want to force her into anything she wasn‚Äôt ready for. But it hurt, I felt alone. I shared this with her at the time.

A few weeks later, I returned to work. I have two jobs, and sometimes work late into the evenings, so it was tough. I stopped soccer practice to spend more time with my son. But overall, things were going well. Our son was thriving and the most happy and healthy little boy, and we were all in a good place.

Meanwhile, y wife rarely left his side. She breastfeeds and didn‚Äôt want to try bottle feeding, afraid he‚Äôd start rejecting the breast. That meant she had to be home all the time, and there were never moments where it was just me and our son. The longest I‚Äôve been alone with him is about two hours, and that‚Äôs an exception. I sometimes found that hard, especially since I was away from home so much, but I accepted that it was just how things were for now.

That‚Äôs why I was really looking forward to my three weeks off when my wife was scheduled to start working again (three days a week, from home). I thought it would finally give me some real one-on-one time with our son. I was also going to take care of him every Tuesday from then on, as I have the day off and she‚Äôd be working.

But my wife felt huge resistance about returning to work and wasn‚Äôt feeling well emotionally in the weeks leading up to it. Since then, breastfeeding has become a struggle. Where our son used to feed calmly, now it often involves crying and frustration. Sometimes he feeds well, but usually not. A lactation consultant came and explained that he compensates by drinking more at other times, so he‚Äôs not lacking nutrients, and the issue with the breastfeeding to be related to her stress.

During those three weeks, my wife didn‚Äôt end up working at all. She spiralled into a rabbit hole about breastfeeding. It was all she could think and talk about. She spent hours Googling and researching. It was incredibly stressful, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells. To restore her milk supply, she needed a lot of skin-to-skin contact and I couldn‚Äôt bottle feed, so again, I was sidelined. I did everything I could to support her, massages, housework, listening, giving her space.

But yesterday, something broke something in me. First, she micromanages a lot. I wanted to dress our son. For months, my wife has chosen all his outfits. Anytime I suggested something, she‚Äôd reject it, not because it wasn‚Äôt practical, but because she didn‚Äôt like it. We had talked about it, and I was finally ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to choose an outfit. When I showed it to her, she made a face. Although it seems small, it really hurt.

Later that day, our son had a short daycare visit (not his first). I was supposed to pick him up with my mom, but my wife insisted on coming too. We were called earlier that day, he was upset and needed to be picked up. My mom was about to arrive, so my wife went alone. When she got home, holding our son, I wanted to cuddle him. I asked if I could, but my wife refused and said she needed it. My mom looked visibly taken aback. A bit later, I was allowed to hold him, but again, it felt reluctant. I told my wife this didn‚Äôt feele okay. She replied that she ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt held him at all‚Äù, even though she was the one who picked him up. Later, she said she just *can‚Äôt* act differently in those moments, her feelings are too overwhelming.

Yesterday, breastfeeding went badly again. My wife had a breakdown and decided to take leave from work until August (she doesn‚Äôt want to bottle feed). That moment triggered a flood of emotions for me: worry for my wife‚Äôs wellbeing and the ongoing feeding issues, disappointment about losing my time off, fear that I still won‚Äôt get meaningful time alone with my son, and the deep insecurities that all of this brings.

I felt overwhelmed and very sad. I shared my feelings and some of the examples from this post. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm reaching out to you: my wife says she understands, but also says she has no control over it (though she promises to try). She also says it‚Äôs all in my head, that I *may* feel this way, but that it‚Äôs not how it *really* is, and that different parents just have different roles. She also told me it‚Äôs unfair of me to bring this up right now, that she needs to relax for her milk supply, that she can‚Äôt use this right now, and that I shouldn‚Äôt talk about it because it adds to her stress. I understand that, but I can‚Äôt not talk about it and act like nothing happened. I still feel sad and she notices.

So, because of a buildup of all these small things, and the way my partner reacts when I address them, I feel unacknowledged and not like an equal parent. Am I overreacting?

Am I The Asshole For Mentally Checking Out?","Hello , everyone . This is my first ever post on reddit ever , this is how you know I must've reached a level of low haha . I do apologize if this is all over the place , the nerves of being open to a public platform and it's the first time I ever told anyone about this situation . So , let's get into the nitty gritty , yeah ?

So , I , 22F , met my best friend Lae 21F about 10-9 years ago . We are long distance friends , met on a social media app and have been glued to each other ever since . I noticed I had feelings for her about 1-2 years ago when she came to me saying she has a crush on some guy , I instantly became jealous , I know what you may be thinking , ""Crow , it's probably you're afraid of her abandoning you."" . Yes , I thought so too , before I shamelessly and stupidly confessed to her my feelings (very poor may I add as I'm not good at expressing feelings) . I let those feelings simmer for days , I wanted to make sure if what I was feeling was fear or if I really liked her and wanted something more than friends . This is my first real friendship after all and I didn't want to ruin that , but , after all the simmering and letting the feelings eat me up. I told her how I felt , and as you read the title , she didn't feel the same , her reasoning was mentally she wasnt ready , shes not into long distance . Reasonings I understood . Though my soul was crushed, even thinking about it today I can feel my heart wrenching at what I felt ; I really really liked her , I love her humor , her smile , her laugh , how she's passionate about her interests , how she's every single bit of herself and isn't shamless about it . But , after so many rejections in my life , a girl like me surely knows how to take it . So I thought , it ate me up more as the months went on and I fell into a deep mental spiral of suicidal thoughts and the constant feeling of ""You're not good enough,  look at you , not even someone you known for so long would want you."" and looking back , it was honestly very pathetic of me . But , we moved on , I moved on like everything was fine . I had doomer thoughts,  you know the whole venting of ""I'll never find love"" , ""love isn't for me"" , ""love is stupid and I don't want it"" the whole thing . She picked up on this and a few months later , she told me , she didn't mind the idea . That she spent some time looking at my photos on insta , even remembering the day they were posted , how she could imagine us doing our dream together and getting coffee etc. etc. I can't remember that conversation as a whole , I just knew it was endearing and very sweet . But , the same things came back up ; far distance , didn't want to do long distance , mentally not ready , didn't want to ruin our friendship. All these things , I very well understood,  and I didn't want to push and shove . I gave up on that topic , I didn't like talking about it and I just wanted to move on . Get peace , I didn't want to have my heart stomped on any more by someone who's meant to love me even if it is platonically.  I just wanted things to go back to what it used to be and somewhere in those months,  I become numb,  lost the feeling as a whole . My brain sometimes does learn itself to bury the feelings that hurt and make me no longer feel and that's how I been for all this time . Auto pilot , work , talking with her , gaming with friends . The usual , just with no emotions attached to any of it . Until a while ago we got into a 2-3 day argument over me just feeling low about myself not being ""attractive"" enough to audition for a role on a show , she went on a rant about how she thinks we shouldn't care about what others think and that we're all unique and that's beautiful.  I told her I understood but I don't see myself as the insta model pretty , I'm just dull and unique in lower level attractiveness . This is when she told me, aired out if you will, that she believes that I was suicidal and gave up on love cause of her . Blaming herself for my mental pain,  which , in some parts of honesty,  yeah . She did cause it , but , it wasn't all her . It was everything , guys didn't want me , girls didn't either , failed attempts and one failed relationship cause I was loved bombed and another was a wlw relationship but it was toxic and really messed me up to make me fall into this hole of never being good enough . But , the thing that bothers me about this is , before hand , it was never brought up , I never brought it up , her rejecting me , I moved on . I didn't want that anymore , I didn't want to deal with that any more , I told her,  I'll always love her , simple as that and i accept she would never love me in the way I do for her . She's extremely private,  never talks about her family to me , always about herself , which is why I fell for her . I got to know all of the things that made her for beautiful and yet , I guess I showed for nothing in her eyes and heart. And now , im settling for the no emotions approach towards her . I know she'll eventually ask me what's wrong cause trust me she always knows . This whole situation has been now eating up at me now as I became restless on a work day and decided to come here to see if any one can decrypt this absolute mind screw up this is. I want to go to people who don't know us and who can give unfiltered opinions . Is there anything I can do or say? Any good conversation topics we can talk about to have us put a pretty tombstone on this 6 foot grave ? Anything will be appreciated and I apologize again for messy writing,  no sleep and hyper thoughts are a recipe for messy writings. ",2,1748512034.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I listen to all their songs including OSTS and everything.. you name it. Not biased, I promise.

(Sorry for shading your song if it happenedüòÖ)

**Ice Cream Cake - The 1st Mini Album (2015)** *9/10    Worst Song: ÏÇ¨ÌÉï (Candy)*

Only reason it's a 9/10 is because 'ÏÇ¨ÌÉï (Candy)' isn't all that memorable but is still a great song and NOT A SKIP but it's a great start to a GREAT group.

**The Red - The 1st Album (2015)** *8/10    Worst Song: Don't U Wait No More*

Don't U Wait No More doesn't really catch my attention

Time Slip was a bit boring

Not a bad album but all songs weren't perfect but  'Campfire' is there and that's on top 5 of my favorite Red Velvet songs EVER!

**The Velvet - The 2nd Mini Album (2016)** *10/10    Worst Song : Light Me Up (Not A Bad Thing Just Overplayed It)*

Great songs all memorable, my most played Album/ Mini Album by Red Velvet and my favorite song on it is either 'Cool Hot Sweet Love' or '*Ïû•ÎØ∏ÍΩÉ Ìñ•Í∏∞Îäî Î∞îÎûåÏóê ÎÇ†Î¶¨Í≥†(Rose Scent Breeze*)'

AWESOME release and my FAVORITE release by them.

**Russian Roulette - The 3rd Mini Album (2016)** *9.5/10    Worst Song: Fool*

Really great Mini Album with great songs that are really catchy that feel like retro vintage diner-like tunes. LOVED 'Lucky Girl' and all the songs there but 'Fool' wasn't really the best on track list!

**Rookie - The 4th Mini Album (2017)** *9*.2*/10    Worst Song: Little Little*

Great release but the Wendy solo and 'Little Little' weren't all that memorable, still prefer the solo more than 'Little Little' and I don't really get the shade to the solo but not a bad release.

**The Red Summer - Summer Mini Album (2017)**¬†9.7*/10    Worst Song: Zoo*

Love fun tracks which doesn't mean 'Zoo' is the worst song but I loved all the others and 'Hear The Sea' was a MASTERPIECE, LOVE LOVE LOVED IT. One of their best releases up to date!

**The Perfect Red Velvet - The 2nd Album Repackage (2018)** *10/10    Worst Song: Doesn't Exist*

Best release to K-POP in general other than 'Angel's Knock - The First Album' by AOA in my opinion. All songs were memorable and catchy, the best song has to be 'About Love' just really catchy and easy to listen to :)

**Summer Magic - Summer Mini Album (2018)**¬†*9.5/10    Worst Song: Mr. E*

When I listen to 'Mr. E' I feel like I'm listening to 'Parade' and that's not a bad thing I still like it but I just don't think it's the best.. 'Hit That Drum' is an AWESOME song and my 4th favorite Red Velvet release EVER. Very GREAT..

**RBB - The 5th Mini Album (2018)** *9.7/10    Worst Song: RBB (Really Bad Boy)*

Great release has 'Taste' in the release and is very memorable and easy to listen to, I'm not shading the title track I just think it has no competition against the side tracks.

**‚ÄôThe Reve Festival‚Äô Day 1 (2019)** *8.9/10    Worst Song: Parade*

All the Reve Festivals they have released are to me their worst releases but that's not a bad thing because all their releases are GREAT. Loved 'LP' and 'Parade' just sounds like a redo of 'Mr. E'

**‚ÄôThe Reve Festival‚Äô Day 2 (2019)** *8.9/10    Worst Song: Jumpin'*

'Jumpin' Didn't feel IN PLACE neither did 'Eyes Locked, Hands Locked' but I just think 'Jumpin' wasn't as memorable as all the others.. I mean none of the songs here had a competition to 'Carpool' which is one of their best songs ever.

**‚ÄôThe Reve Festival‚Äô Finale (2019)** *9/10    Worst Song: Psycho*

I've heard 'Psycho' who knows how many times and it just doesn't feel the same any more.. But 'La Rogue - Special Track' is just a delicacy... It's untouchable. That song has a special place in my heart. This release was great but not as good as past releases.

**Queendom - The 6th Mini Album (2021)** *9.6/10    Worst Song: Queendom*

'Queendom' isn't a bad song it's just most of the time TT (Title Tracks) can never compete with side tracks.. Like try competing with 'Better Be' you can't. That song is just so GREAT and all the other songs are SO GREAT.

**'The Reve Festival 2022 - Feel My Rhythm' (2022)** *9.8/10    Worst Song: Rainbow Halo*

'Rainbow Halo' felt really childish and not too great to me but it's still a great song and 'Good, Bad, Ugly' is their 5th best song ever. I mean the instrumental, lyrics, vibes... Sent from the gods. Other songs here are JUST AS GOOD.

**Bloom (2022)** *8.5/10 (Worst Release)    Worst Song: 'Cause it's you*

Some of the songs are good some are okay... Maybe one skip in album which is well, the worst song. Best song is 'Swimming Pool' it's just so fun and feels JUST LIKE SUMMER. If you would've put that in Red Summer it would be a full on 10/10. Other than that some of the songs either feel not too great or just something I don't vibe A LOT with. My least streamed album on Spotify only 2k minutes (WHICH IS NOTHING COMPARED TO OTHER RELEASES)üòÖ

**'The Reve Festival 2022 - Birthday' (2022)** *8.7/10    Worst Song: Celebrate*

'Celebrate' felt too short and felt like a ""You're going somewhere.."" to a ""Go girl give us nothing"" type of song, really good song for when I want to feel calm and chill but on a GOOD DAY 'ZOOM' is on BLAST.. Good release, not the best.

**Chill Kill - The 3rd Album (2023)** *10/10 (2nd Best Release)    Worst Song: Bulldozer*

Even though Bulldozer isn't the best song it's still not a skip and I LOVE IT, it just doesn't compete with the other songs.. 'One Kiss' 'Nightmare' 'Underwater' and 'Iced Coffee' are some of their best releases with 'Underwater' at number 2. Really memorable and great work..

**Cosmic (2024)** *9.9/10 (3rd Best Release)    Worst Song: Sweet Dreams*

Sweet Dreams was GREAT but just isn't as good as other songs here.. 'Bubble' is their BEST SONG EVER.. and 'Last Drop' is their 3rd best. This release has GREAT VARIETY even with just a few songs. Red Velvet's discography up to here makes me question fans who only listen to TT (Title Tracks) because they're sooo missing outüòÖ



**EXTRAS (IRENE & SEULGI)**

**Monster - The 1st Mini Album (2020)** *9/10    Worst Song: Uncover (Sung by SEULGI)*

'Diamond' 'Feel Good' and 'Jelly' are such great songs but 'Uncover'... Just isn't, it feels really slow.. I definitely have streamed it plenty of times especially in my playlist that isn't full of full artist discographies where I have MOOD playlists. It's in my slow/calm one. GREAT RELEASE.

**TILT - The 2nd Mini Album (2025)** *8.9/10    Worst Song: Trampoline*

'Girl Next Door' and 'Irresistible' were such GOOD songs. Some other songs didn't sound AWESOME but they were okay or great. 'TILT' was so good I was honestly surprised at how good it was. I do recommend listening to the releases from their sub-unit!

  


**Solo Projects**

**Hello - Special Album (2021)** *9/10    Worst Song: If Only*

'If Only' is a good song but it wasn't the best.. Songs like 'Day By Day' and 'Je T'aime' are really good ones that I REALLY did LIKE. Truly a special album and was better than I expected (WORTH THE LISTEN)



**28 Reasons - The 1st Mini Album (2022)** *9.9/10    Worst Song: Bad Boy, Sad Girl*

I really liked all the songs and worst song doesn't matter I just didn't think this song was a Perfect 10 (reference intended) REALLY MEMORABLE and has great variety.. 'Los Angeles' and 'Anywhere But Home' felt just like home when I heard them.. 'Anywhere But Home' truly made me cry..

**Accidentally On Purpose - The 2nd Mini Album (2025)** *8/10    Worst Song: Rollin' (With My Homies)*

Not something I would listen to on loop like I do with some other releases, but definitely something I'd listen to once a day. Some of the songs felt out of place or not too bright or maybe even a bit boring.. (Sorry I had to say it I REALLY DID) not all that memorable. Worst release that isn't Red Velvet

**Like A Flower - The 1st Mini Album (2024)** *10/10 (IF WAS POSSIBLE WOULD BE 4TH BEST RELEASE BUT I DON'T WANT TO MERGE FULL GROUP WITH SOLO/ SUB PROJECTS)    Worst Song: Does Not Exist*

Best solo release and it just made sense.. I LOVE 'Strawberry Silhouette' and 'Winter Wish' good variety of slower songs, and the TT (Title Track) was great and really made me 'Sing in the shower' (IYKYK) EXTREMELY MEMORABLE AND RECENT ALBUM..

  
**Like Water - The 1st Mini Album (2021)** *8.7/10    Worst Song: Best Friend (with SEULGI)*

'Best Friend (with SEULGI)' is lyrically great and IS WHAT I EXPECTED, because I song like such wouldn't be all party party/ upbeat or dancy. But it wasn't the best.. 'The Road' is a masterpiece and is one of the best songs in the entire world.. 

**Wish You Hell - The 2nd Mini Album (2024)** *9/10    Worst Song: Wish You Hell*

'Wish You Hell' (THE TITLE TRACK) was different than I expected and not the best song.. 'Queen Of The Party' on the other hand is THAT GIRL... Loved that song and always will... 'His Car Isn't Yours' was VERY SURPRISING IN A GOOD WAY. That song was honestly a breath of fresh air..

  
**Worst Single - Rebirth (2017)** *7.7/10*

Not all that.. Not really much words except for it feels a bit boring at times.

**Best Single - Be Natural (2014)** *10/10*

Very old vintage GOOD feel, very sexy feel. A very 'high heels' song if you know what I'm saying. This song makes me feel like THAT B!TCH to be honest.. The vocals are awesome and it's Red Velvet's BEST SONG tied with 'Bubble' (Yes I can't decide)

1ky6l2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/1ky6l2u/my_random_suggestions_since_returning_after_more/,My Random Suggestions (Since returning after more than a year),"Felt the need to scratch a particular itch this game fills and decided to fire it up again. I don't think I've played since it was still in Alpha. Trader Joel used to be the first trader you went to in the Navezgane map and had a different voice. (And holy hell, I don't think the current one's an improvement). I also want to note that I don't really have any expectations for this being implemented and admittedly have no idea how easy or hard any of this would be to add. Anyway, just some ideas that have popped into my head as I was playing and some held over from the past:

* **Foods:** General stuff I'd like would be for some more recipes, I know others might disagree but I wouldn't mind ones that are redundant for their tier. Some I can imagine would be:
   1. Ramen - Made with Miso Soup, Meat, Cornstarch (for the noodles), and egg
   2. Canned Tomato Sauce
   3. Powdered Dairy (can be added to coffee or blackstrap coffee to increase their bonus. Or something. Maybe add snow and make iced lattes?)
   4. Cheese Product (I think you can see where this is going)
   5. Pizza - Canned Tomato Sauce, Corn Meal, Cheese, Meat
   6. Fresh Sham Sandwich - Sham, cornmeal, and water (fresher, more filling, and no chance to crap yourself)
* **Creatures:** I'm not sure how to expand on the zombie ranks without just aping left 4 dead, and to that end I don't know if that sort of thing could legally be done. (I guess no one can copyright 'Zombie, but also The Hulk. And we basically have boomers) But outside of that I had some other ideas like wildlife.
   1. Raccoons - Raccoons will normally be as elusive as deer or rabbits, running from the player than sticking around, but they'll sometimes keep nearby and loot loose items dropped, so be careful if you're trying to juggle your inventory.
   2. Zombified Deer - Really they wouldn't behave much different from regular deer, even zombie infection not changing their temperament. But they are gaunt, creepy as hell, and drop rotten meat instead of normal meat when knifed. They do make noise (also creepy) and can attract other zombies/increase the 'heat' in your area though if you leave them around for too long.
   3. Bat Swarms - A flock of infected bats that don't do much damage, but when they start to attack you that envelop your vision and cause vision sway, requiring you to take swings in melee or fire your gun to fend them off which might leave you vulnerable and blind to other zombies.
   4. Death Cultist - I know they're working on bandits, but maybe this could be a simpler step: basically, some survivors just kind of 'lose it' and see the zombie infection as a good thing and heralds of the dead. They're mostly still human (albeit having been infected) and wear tattered, bloody robes and use melee weapons (probably just bats, pipes, planks of wood), if you don't headshot them, they drop their weapon 'revive' as a full zombie.
   5. Settlers - Not really a true entity, in my mind these would be ambient NPCs living at Trader bases to show it's part of a the greater White River settlement and you're not necessarily the only people there. Possibly easiest way is to remodel trader areas with some small, locked cabins and you can see the settlers inside, minding their own business and effectively cannot be interacted with. If we were allowed to go further, maybe after completing certain jobs like supply runs for a trader, they might also give you something for free (usually food or water in thanks), maybe have in some settlements one be a medic who can heal you for dukes, and even have some of these settlers 'posted' in guard towers, shooting zombies that get too close.
* **New Traders:** Kind of iffy, but figure even on Navezgane map, individual biomes are large enough you could justify an extra trader or two. Had an idea for some
   1. Trader Sue - Formerly a Waitress and now defacto owner, operator, and trader of Suzie's Diner (formerly Jock's). She runs a modest trading post out of an old truck stop diner and gas station and specializes in food, an older and more mature woman still wearing her 50's-style waitress getup. In the default map she's spawn in far east of the Pine Forest.
   2. Trader Tek - Living out in the wasteland, Trader Tek is a bit of a mad scientist who suffers people to help him further enable his experiments. Insists he be called 'Doctor' (his 'PhD' is even more questionable than Jen's), but no one calls him that, and specializes in science and mods. Wears some sterotypical mad scientist garb, ratty, dirty, and tattered but whether its from surviving the apocalypse or just his experiments is anyone's guess.
* **New Difficulty Mechanics:** I play on a super easy setting, so take some of these ideas with a grain of salt but I think it could be neat for some people.
   1. Food Spoilage - No more hording those pots of meat stew or expecting that blueberry pie to stay good in your pocket forever! Now all food has a built in timer it will count down from upon being first accessed/crafted that will allow it to be edible for so many in-game days and, if not consumed, it becomes a lump of spoiled food. It's theoretically still edible but expect dysentery.
   2. ""Storm's A'comin'!"" - Basically on the day of a bloodmoon, Traders will be closed for the full day of and day after the Bloodmoon. Possible additional difficulty modifier including any quests you have from a trader automatically fail if you do not do them before they close up for the Bloodmoon Horde.
* **Sanity Mechanic:** Could also be an optional difficulty, but basically under certain circumstances, your character is more or less prone to various sanity effects. The Sanity 'meter' would not be a visible bar like health and other things, but the gist would be like:
   * Things that reduce your sanity:
      * Being at low health
      * Being hungry/thirsty
      * Having a concussion
      * Night time
      * Fighting a certain number of zombies at a time (number to be determined)
      * Recently dying
      * Being at over 50% infection
      * Being in the Wasteland biome.
   * Things that restore sanity:
      * Critical hits on enemies
      * Consuming food/drink that restores over 25 points of hunger and thirst (A hearty meal)
      * Beer and any of the 'Grandpa's' drinks except the 'Forgitin' elixir'
      * Being near a lit Campfire, forge fire, or Chemistry station
   * Sanity Effects: (what everyone is interested in seeing)
      * Hearing whispered voices
      * Slight sway in the camera at the edges of the screen
      * Ammo count 'glitching'.
      * Finding items in containers that don't exist
      * Dead bodies (the ones that aren't just sleeping zombies) staring at you
      * Hallucinatory Zombie attacking you
      * Hallucinating the Bloodmoon.
      * Seeing a Trader sign in the distance (unique to desert biome)
      * Compass icons disappearing
* **Miscellaneous**
   1. Maybe an alternative top tier blade that's like a proper sword? That'd be nice. 
   2. Alternate models for Crafting Stations so we can have a range or those iron furnaces for cooking.
   3. For crafted cabinets, fridges, etc. to all have storage capacity equal to the crates. I know it's not realistic but it's annoying how in about every survival crafter I play, storage options are limited and don't offer more aesthetically pleasing options for homes.

# Key Elements of Modern Luxury Living Room Design 

https://preview.redd.it/f5yx7h6gwo3f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3963af5ce68d4062e7346d5c3bcdc122126eeebf

Creating a luxury living room that reflects modern trends requires an understanding of its defining features. One essential aspect is the use of high-quality materials. Designers often select premium fabrics and finishes, such as velvet, silk, or natural woods, to evoke sophistication. Coupled with exceptional craftsmanship, these choices add an element of durability, ensuring the space not only looks beautiful but also stands the test of time.

A sophisticated color palette plays a pivotal role in setting the tone for the luxury living room. Neutral tones like whites, grays, and beiges serve as ideal backdrops, while deeper hues, such as navy or emerald green, can be incorporated in accents to create a sense of depth and richness. Choosing the right colors enhances the overall aesthetic and promotes a calming atmosphere, which is essential in a modern luxury space.

Exquisite furniture pieces are another hallmark of modern luxury living rooms. The best interior designers in Dombivli curate furniture that reflects both comfort and style. Consideration is given to each piece, ensuring they are not only visually stunning but also functional and comfortable. Statement sofas, unique coffee tables, and elegant accent chairs can elevate a living space, making it inviting without compromising on sophistication.

Artful decor and accessories are integral to enhancing luxury. This can include carefully selected artwork, elegant vases, or curated decorative objects that add personality to the room. Additionally, lighting plays an essential role in highlighting these features; strategic placement of fixtures creates ambient lighting while accentuating key design elements.

Space utilization is fundamental in a luxury living room. Thoughtful layouts allow for fluid movement and encourage the gathering of family and friends. Lastly, smart technology integration ensures that modern conveniences coexist seamlessly within the design, showcasing the essence of contemporary luxury living. The fusion of these elements results in a polished, sophisticated ambiance that resonates with modern trendsetters seeking luxury in every detail.

# Color Trends in Luxury Living Rooms 

https://preview.redd.it/kjyit7ohwo3f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6c3cf5e8781fd6d767a92cf58aa2ce5b9a7c532

In the realm of luxury living room designs, color plays a pivotal role in establishing ambiance and elevating the aesthetic appeal of a space. Contemporary trends highlight the versatility of color schemes, which not only cater to personal preferences but also reflect broader design movements. Neutral tones remain a foundational choice, providing a serene backdrop that enhances the overall elegance of a room. Shades such as beige, taupe, and soft greys allow for flexibility in decorating as they can easily complement various furnishings and decor styles.

Choosing the right furniture is pivotal in creating a luxurious living room that embodies elegance and comfort. As you embark on this journey, consider the overall style you wish to achieve. Various aesthetics, including modern, minimalist, and traditional, each offer unique characteristics that can define your luxurious space.

In a modern living room, sleek lines, and soft textures can create an understated elegance. Opt for furniture pieces that are streamlined yet functional, such as a low-profile sofa paired with a minimalist coffee table. Accessible options like modular furniture not only provide versatility but also align perfectly with contemporary elegance. Alternatively, those leaning towards a more traditional design might find rich materials, intricate patterns, and classic silhouettes more appealing. For instance, a grand sofa accented with ornamental details can serve as a stunning focal point in your living room.

Regardless of the style, comfort should always rank highly on your list of priorities. It is essential to select pieces that offer both visual appeal and functional comfort. For instance, ergonomic chairs with quality upholstery can provide the necessary support for extended seating. Additionally, opting for high-quality materials can ensure longevity, making your investment worthwhile over time.

When selecting statement pieces, such as a luxury coffee table or unique accent chairs, consider their presence within the room. These items can contribute significantly to the ambiance.

In contemporary luxury living rooms, the integration of technology has become an essential aspect of design.

Smart home systems are at the forefront of this evolution, offering seamless control over lighting, temperature, and security. By incorporating these systems, interior designers in Dombivli can create spaces that not only look sophisticated but also provide convenience and efficiency.

One important consideration is the installation of advanced audio-visual setups.

This allows homeowners to enjoy a cinematic experience while ensuring that the design remains polished and coherent. When seeking the best interior designers in Dombivli, it is essential to find professionals who understand how to merge technology with luxury aesthetics effectively.

Luxury interior designers in Dombivli often focus on sourcing products that align with modern environmental standards while providing high-end functionality.

# Art and Decor: Making a Statement 

https://preview.redd.it/nna4ejamwo3f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3733af30f44f1e1ed6c8c3c83ebc8ca0e5c850a9

In luxury living room designs, the choice of art and decor plays a pivotal role in shaping the overall atmosphere and elegance of the space. Art is not merely an accessory; it is a form of expression that reveals the personal aesthetic of the inhabitants. Selecting the right artwork and decor elements can transform a conventional living room into a sophisticated sanctuary that resonates with the taste of its owners.

When approaching the selection process, it is essential to consider pieces that reflect individual preferences while complementing the existing decor. This involves choosing artwork that aligns with the room's color scheme and style. For instance, a contemporary space can benefit from abstract paintings, while classic interiors may call for traditional landscapes or portraits. The choice of art not only adds visual interest but can also enhance the emotional connection to the space, creating a more inviting environment.

Placement of art is equally crucial in elevating the aesthetic value of luxury living rooms. Art should be displayed at eye level, allowing viewers to engage with it fully. Grouping smaller pieces can create a dynamic gallery wall that draws attention, while larger standalone artworks can serve as focal points. Custom framing is another aspect that should not be overlooked; well-chosen frames can enhance the artwork's beauty and tie together the room's decor. Luxury interior designers in Dombivli often recommend integrating complementary decor elements, such as decorative vases or sculptures, that resonate with the artwork, thereby creating a cohesive look.

Ultimately, the goal of integrating art and decor in a luxury living room is to create a space that is not only visually stunning but also deeply personal. Engaging the expertise of the best interior designers in Dombivli can help in navigating the myriad options available, ensuring that every element speaks to both luxury and individuality.

# The Role of Textiles in Luxury Design 

https://preview.redd.it/c0t3qxrnwo3f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb14a63faea365b6b58bc603c9ce25ff9703428b

The choice of textiles plays a pivotal role in creating an atmosphere of luxury within modern living rooms. Interior designers in Dombivli understand that the right fabrics not only enhance aesthetics but also elevate the tactile experience of a space. Rich materials such as velvet, silk, and cashmere are particularly favored in luxury design due to their opulent textures and inherent visual depth.

Upholstery is one of the first areas to consider when designing a high-end living room. Selecting the best interior designers in Dombivli ensures that the right fabrics are chosen for sofas and chairs, transforming simple furniture into elegant focal points. Velvet, for instance, adds a sumptuous feel while reflecting light in a way that brings spaces to life. When coupled with contrasting textures, such as leather or nubby weaves, it creates a sophisticated interplay that draws the eye.

Window treatments are another critical aspect where textiles contribute to a luxurious atmosphere. Luxury interior designers in Dombivli emphasize the use of flowing silk or soft linen curtains, which not only frame views beautifully but also provide an aura of refinement. Integrating these textiles enhances the overall color palette of the room, allowing natural light to filter through in the most flattering manner.

Area rugs are often the unsung heroes of a luxury living room. The top 10 interior designers in Dombivli frequently recommend using hand-knotted or high-pile rugs to anchor furniture arrangements and add layers of comfort. A plush rug can instill warmth underfoot while tying together various elements of the decor. Additionally, throw pillows crafted from luxurious fabrics can provide an easy method to refresh the room's look, allowing for seasonal updates without a full revamp.

In conclusion, the thoughtful selection of textiles is essential for crafting a high-end living room that exudes luxury. By focusing on premium materials and their thoughtful integration, a space can achieve both elegance and comfort, appealing to modern trendsetters who seek a sophisticated lifestyle.

# Creating an Inviting Ambiance with Lighting

Creating a luxurious living room requires more than just high-end furniture and d√©cor; it is essential to consider how lighting can influence the overall atmosphere. The right lighting not only highlights the beauty of your space but also creates an inviting ambiance that makes guests feel welcome. Different lighting options can achieve this, including chandeliers, recessed lighting, and floor lamps. Each type of lighting serves a distinct purpose and can significantly transform a room.

Chandeliers often serve as a statement piece in luxury interiors. A well-chosen chandelier can draw the eye upward, making the ceiling appear higher while adding a touch of elegance to the living room. Whether you opt for a classic crystal design or a modern metallic fixture, chandeliers are undeniably one of the best interior designers in Dombivli‚Äôs recommendations for any opulent space.

Recessed lighting is another fantastic option for creating a sophisticated look. These fixtures are fitted into the ceiling, providing a clean, streamlined appearance. They can be strategically placed to highlight artwork, architectural features, or specific zones within the room, ensuring a well-lit yet unobtrusive environment. This flexibility allows homeowners to control where the light falls, enhancing the design elements without overwhelming the space.

Floor lamps can also play a crucial role in layering light within the living room. They add a soft glow and can compliment other light sources effectively. Opting for [**luxury interior designers in Dombivli**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-dombivli/)¬†to select the right floor lamp can result in a more cohesive visual narrative throughout the room.

# Best Sweetener 2025: Reviews & How to Choose

The quest for the perfect sweetener is a journey many health-conscious individuals and those managing specific dietary needs undertake. Equal, a renowned brand of artificial sweetener, has been a staple in households and food products for decades. As tastes evolve and research advances, it's essential to re-evaluate its place in the modern sweetener landscape. This review provides a comprehensive look at equal sweetener, exploring its features, benefits, considerations, and how it stacks up against its competitors, guiding you towards the best sweetener choice for 2025.

[[Explore Top Rated equal sweetener on Amazon.]](https://blog.trendsupplier.com/clearance-section/?kw=equal sweetener)

## Key Features Analysis

Equal sweetener offers several features that make it a popular choice for many consumers.**Aspartame-Based Formula:** Equal derives its sweetness from aspartame, a low-calorie artificial sweetener.Aspartame is approximately 200 times sweeter than sugar, allowing for a considerably reduced caloric intake when used as a sugar substitute. Its concentrated sweetness means only a small amount is needed to achieve the desired flavor profile,making it a cost-effective option for sweetening beverages and foods.

**Convenient Packaging:** Equal is available in various formats, including individual packets, tablets, and bulk canisters. The individual packets are highly convenient for on-the-go use,allowing users to easily sweeten thier coffee,tea,or other beverages while traveling or at work. The tablet form is ideal for those seeking a precise dosage, while the bulk canisters are suitable for home baking and cooking.

**Low-Calorie Composition:** As aspartame is used in minimal quantities, Equal sweetener contributes negligible calories to a serving. This is a significant advantage for individuals who are trying to manage their weight or reduce their overall calorie consumption. The near-zero calorie count allows people to enjoy sweet-tasting foods and drinks without the guilt or impact on their daily calorie intake.

**Suitable for Individuals with Diabetes:** Aspartame, the key ingredient in Equal, generally has minimal impact on blood glucose levels. This makes Equal a suitable option for individuals with diabetes who need to control their sugar intake. It provides a sweet taste without causing a rapid spike in blood glucose,making it a valuable addition to a diabetic-friendly diet.

Key features of the Equal Sweetener include:

* Aspartame-based formula
* Convenient packaging
* Low-calorie composition
* Suitable for individuals with diabetes

## core Benefits

Equal sweetener provides several key benefits for consumers seeking a sugar choice.

**Weight Management Support:** By offering a virtually calorie-free sweetening solution, Equal can play a supportive role in weight management efforts.Replacing sugar with Equal can significantly reduce overall calorie intake, aiding in weight loss or maintenance. As an example, substituting sugar in a daily coffee routine with Equal can save a substantial number of calories over time.

**Blood Sugar Control:** For individuals managing diabetes or pre-diabetes, Equal offers a safer way to enjoy sweet-tasting foods and beverages without the adverse effects of sugar. Because aspartame has a minimal impact on blood glucose levels, it allows for better control over blood sugar spikes. This is especially beneficial in maintaining stable energy levels throughout the day.

**Tooth Decay Prevention:** Unlike sugar, aspartame does not contribute to tooth decay. Sugar provides a food source for oral bacteria, leading to the production of acids that erode tooth enamel. By using Equal as a sweetener,individuals can reduce their risk of cavities and other dental problems,contributing to better overall oral health.

## FAQs Section

**Is Equal Sweetener safe for consumption?**

Yes, aspartame, the primary ingredient in Equal, has been extensively studied and approved by regulatory agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Food and Drug Management (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). These agencies have concluded that aspartame is safe for consumption when used within acceptable daily intake levels. Though, individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder, should avoid aspartame due to their inability to properly metabolize phenylalanine, a component of aspartame.

**Can Equal Sweetener be used in baking?**

While Equal can be used in some baking applications, it's critically important to note that aspartame may lose its sweetness when exposed to high temperatures for extended periods. Therefore, it's best used in recipes that do not require prolonged cooking or high heat. For baking, it's often recommended to use Equal in combination with other sweeteners that are more heat-stable or to choose a different type of low-calorie sweetener altogether, specifically designed for baking purposes.

**What is the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of aspartame?**

The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for aspartame has been established by regulatory agencies to ensure safe consumption levels. The FDA has set the ADI at 50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day. This means that for a 150-pound (68-kilogram) person, the ADI would be 3400 milligrams of aspartame per day. This is considered a very conservative level,and it's highly unlikely that an average person would exceed this intake through normal dietary habits.

## Competitor Comparison

To determine the best sweetener for 2025, consider Equal alongside its competitors.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### Equal
- **Sweetening Agent:** Aspartame
- **Calorie Content:** Virtually zero calories
- **Heat Stability:** Less stable at high temperatures
- **Taste Profile:** Tastes similar to sugar but may leave a slight aftertaste for some

#### Splenda
- **Sweetening Agent:** Sucralose
- **Calorie Content:** Virtually zero calories
- **Heat stability:** More stable at high temperatures
- **Taste Profile:** Sweet taste, generally considered to have less aftertaste than aspartame

#### Stevia
- **Sweetening Agent:** Steviol glycosides (from the stevia plant)
- **Calorie Content:** Virtually zero calories
- **Heat Stability:** Generally stable at high temperatures
- **Taste Profile:** Can have a slightly bitter or licorice-like aftertaste

### Key differences Summary

Equal's key advantage lies in its long-standing presence and familiarity for many consumers. Splenda, with its sucralose base, offers better heat stability, making it more suitable in baking applications. Stevia, a natural sweetener, appeals to those seeking plant-based alternatives but may not be palatable to everyone due to its unique aftertaste. For users prioritizing taste and a classic sugar-like experience, Equal remains a solid choice. However, Splenda might be a better option if heat stability is crucial, and Stevia could be considered by those seeking a more natural alternative.

Its negligible calorie content allows them to enjoy sweet tastes without the added calories of sugar. This makes it a practical addition to their daily diet and lifestyle.**Individuals with Prediabetes or diabetes:** People with diabetes or prediabetes benefit from Equal as it has minimal impact on blood sugar levels. This supports their efforts to manage blood glucose and enjoy sweetened items without the risks associated with high sugar consumption. It offers a valuable way to make dietary modifications that improve health outcomes.**Those Seeking a Budget-friendly Option:** Equal often provides a cost-effective alternative to sugar and certain other sweeteners.

## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

When considering Equal sweetener, assess your specific priorities regarding sweetness, heat stability, and aftertaste preferences. If you need a familiar sweetener for beverages and are on a budget, Equal is a viable choice. However, for baking purposes or if you prefer a different taste profile altogether, Splenda or Stevia might be more suitable options.

Equal remains a frequently selected sweetener in 2025, thanks to its established reputation, low-calorie content, and affordability. Its accessibility and relative safety for most individuals, particularly those managing diabetes or weight, continue to make it a convenient option.

1ky62e4,https://i.redd.it/b5t0a3t3so3f1.jpeg,The only post you‚Äôll need to read to PASS the FE Civil exam - i promise.,"* I‚Äôm aware that the post is long, but kindly read it - i wish everyone will pass and this is all what you need i promise, be committed, have discipline & don‚Äôt procrastinate- your future depends on it. 

Well, i passed and here‚Äôs what i did & im +95% positive it will work for everyone who follow these exact steps:

Full study stage will take you 3 months if you spend 1.5 hours daily with two days break. You might be faster. 

Part one: Study Material (in correct order):

1- Mark mattson videos.

Printout the questions and solve with him every question - if there is anything you dont understand screenshot the questions and go to your dear friend Chatgpt, upload the questions and ask it to solve and explain it to you like a 11 years old. It just works perfectly and the information will stuck in your brain for too long because of the real life scenario it builds to make you understand the problem. 

2- islam 800 (doesn‚Äôt matter what version you‚Äôll get).

The reason is because there are 800 questions in this book but from my experience as a two time FE civil taker, you‚Äôll get 1-2 similar questions from the full 800 questions in this book - but the reason why its a valuble resaource is because it makes you so muh familiar with the handbook - it goes thourughly to all the equations in the handbook and you‚Äôll know when to use each one of them and where to find it - extremly helpful ! 

- at this point you refreshed your memory with the mark mattson videos & got familiar with the handbook and all the question materials and equations you will use - 

3- PrepFE.

Subcsribe for a month & start spreading your referral link on reddit - i paid for one month and got 8 months for free from referral links.
PrepFE is amazing if you used it correctly, and i‚Äôll show you how.

Start by taking categorized exams - each day a different gateroy and aim for +35 questions for each category. At this time you just want to get familiar with the questions and how they look because the presentation are very similar to the real deal.

After finishing all of the categories you need to start taking the 25 questions exam (no time limit) - at this point i aimed for 1 exam a day because in this stage you need to review every single question you got wrong and learn it all over again to make sure you‚Äôll surely solve it the next time you see it. Keep taking thes exmas until you average score on 65% and more.

After getting the 65% mark you need to start taking the timed exams (20 questions - 1 hour). I took once daily as well with reviewing every question i didnt know and aimed for higher avergae everytime - at this point you‚Äôll be familiar with making educated guesses and get the right answer 50% of the time even if you dont know the solution. Keep hitting the timed exams until you average 70% or more every single time. 

By reaching to this point you probably must solve +1000 question on PrepFE in total to get all the tricky ideas and units tricks and everything.

4- purchase the NCEES interactive 50 questions exam.

This is the most amazing resource to wrap up all the studying you did. Now trust me on this one - i recomment you to solve it with unlimited time the first time (preferably before the exam in two weeks because this will be your last studying material) - i solved it in 3 days - i took my time and kept trying with each question because ei wanted it to stuck on my brain. I got 54% the first time. Then i took two days only reviewing the questions i didnt solve correctly. After that i took two days break and went on solving the exam but this time i put the timer on and solved it fully withing the time limit and i got 87% - same thing i rested for one day and then re took it timed and got 94% - at this point i practically memorized the questions and got familiar with the exam concepts and tricks.

- at this point i FELT ready - 

I kept solving one timed exam per day on PrepFE until the day before the exam, i took it as a brain break and didnt do anything. 

Part two: Exam day.

My exam was at 9 AM - i slept at 10 the day before, woke up at 5 AM, drank a cup of coffee and a banana after it (bananas are great from exam day). Took a shower and got ready and reached at 8 AM to the testing center.

What to get with you? 

1- Calculator.
2- ID/passport.
3- NCEES exam confirmation letter.
4- MOST IMPORTANTLY - a protein bar. Choose one that is high in fibers and contain ZERO sugars - sugar will spike you up for an hour and then crash you to the ground. 

Now for the fun part: NCEES is vogue in this one but i‚Äôll help you out, please read this part carefully as its the part that will make you pass if done correctly and will make you fail if done wrong - this is the JUICE. 

Strategy & understanding the exam time limit. 

Exam time: total time for the exam is 5 hours & 20 minutes (AKA 320 minutes) 
You have two sections during the exam, the morning session and the afternoon session.
Here is the fun part that NCEES wont tell you..

THE TIME WILL KEEP GOING IF YOU DIDN‚ÄôT SUBMIT THE FIRST SECTION. 

Read it again & again & again. 
This is the cause for the high failing rate - no one tells you that you need to manage your time between section 1 and section 2 and no one tells you that whatever time remaining in section 1 will be added on section 2 and whatever time passed after section one‚Äôs designated time will be DEDUCTED from section 2. 

- i‚Äôll tell you exactly what to do to save a lot of time - 

Strategy:

The first thing you do is remind your self that you only have 160 minutes for the first section. Whatever happens DO NOT exceed the 160 minutes mark trust me. Section 2 is 25% harder. 

- by the way, wear the ear plugs they give you, it will separate you from the world around you and keep you focused -

Now, the correct strategy to solve this exam and please commit to it or else you‚Äôll increase your chance of failing. 

Immediate flag of the following:
1- a question you haven‚Äôt seen before & dont know where to look it up. 
2- a question you are familiar with but not sure if you can solve it correctly the first time.
3- a question you are familiar with BUT it will take you +3 minutes to solve. (Flag it flag it flag it) 

One more thing, dont get stressed from the first 5 questions, they usually put them hard questions to stress you out, flag and keep going. 

At this point you are going smoothly with the exam, you‚Äôre solving the 1-2 minutes questions and life is good. 
After you complete all the 57 questions in the first session and you solved all the things you are sure of its time to get back to the flagged ones. 
Start with the questions that you‚Äôre familiar with but it will take you +3 minutes to solve. Solve them and then go back to the secod type - familiar but not sure how to solve from the first time - keep trying to solve it (make and educated guess if you didnt know how solve within 4 minutes) and keep going . Never stay on one question for more than 5 min, its not worth it. 

By the way, whatever question you go back to it solve it correctly remove the flag mark on it so you can count later how many you are sure of - will help you mentally. 

Now the first category of flagged questions- allow yourself 2 minutes for each if you didnt know how to solve it keep it flagged and choose one the letters ( A - B - C - D ) whatever you choose at this point you need to be committed with if you choose B then all the flagged questions that you dont know you‚Äôll put them B and so on. One will wonder why is that? Its because if you‚Äôre choosing one letter everytime then the percentage of getting a correct answer is 25%!! So please do it and be commited to it. ( statistically, B have higher percentage of around 28% correct answers ü§´) 

If you did this strategy, i guarantee you you‚Äôll have a minimum of 15 minutes extra time on the clock before you need to submit ( remember NCEES doesn‚Äôt stop the time for you - you need to do submit it yourself ) .

Submit and TAKE your 25 minutes break - drink some water - EAT your protein bar ( you‚Äôll need it for session 2 ) - and please please please don‚Äôt smoke during this break, I‚Äôm a smoker myself as well but its not good to smoke it will relax you and loosen your focus - wait till the end of the exam it will taste much better i promise. 

Second session will be the same strategy as part 1, flag and commit to flagging and choosing only one letter when you don‚Äôt know the answer don‚Äôt mix up the letters. 

Aim for +33 correct questions out of 57 in part one ( its easier ) & +23 correct question out of 53 in part two, should be enough for passing if used with this strategy.

Good Luck to all of you & i wish the best for every single one of you - engineers are the pillars to any country, believe in yourselves and be proud always with the outcomes - you got this!!!

1ky5sgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ky5sgb/my_partner_invalidated_my_experience_with_rape/,My partner invalidated my experience with rape and I don‚Äôt know what to think,"For context, my partner was raped repeatedly as a child, which I‚Äôm sure has a lot of influence on their opinion of what that word entails. When they told me about it, I was grateful that they were able to open up about their experience with me, and I showed them love and support. I did not share my own experience with them until years later, but when I did, they told me that what I went through wasn‚Äôt considered rape and I‚Äôve never known what to think about it since then. I‚Äôve gone back and forth on whether or not I am fully to blame for what happened, or if I truly was taken advantage of. I‚Äôll share my story with you now.

This happened back when I was 23 or 24, I‚Äôd recently moved to a new town and didn‚Äôt know anyone in the area, aside from a couple family members. I started a new job and became friends with a couple coworkers around my age. They would invite me to come hang out with them at the local bars during our time off where they would go all out and drink till they were sick, and they knew a lot of the people who frequented these places.

I‚Äôm extremely introverted, my idea of a good time with friends is staying at home playing video games or watching movies. I‚Äôm not against drinking by any means, but partying and being out on the town and socializing with tons of people while getting wasted just isn‚Äôt my idea of a fun time. Over time, I started declining their offers to go out more regularly and every time I did, they would guilt trip me and complain about how I never wanted to hang out with them.

On the night of the incident, it was one of my friends‚Äôs birthdays, so I didn‚Äôt feel like I could reject their offer to go out that time. The plan was to hit up every bar we could to get them free birthday shots. At one of the bars, we ran into this guy who they knew but I had never met. He was charming, and started doing card tricks and telling jokes and kinda just inserted himself into our group and followed us to the next bar we went to. I was pretty tipsy at this point and mentioned to one of my friends that I thought he was kinda cute, and they apparently told him what I‚Äôd said without me noticing, because he suddenly started paying a lot more attention to me. The night went on and we all got more and more drunk, and this guy eventually asked me to come home with him. I said no, but he kept insisting that nothing would happen, he just wanted to make sure I had a ‚Äúsafe place to stay that night‚Äù. My friends found out about his offer and started peer pressuring me into going home with him saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a great guy, you should have fun, live a little etc.‚Äù Eventually I was coerced into agreeing to go with him. I still didn‚Äôt want to, I knew it was a bad idea, but I was too drunk to think rationally, and I didn‚Äôt want to be judged for going against everyone‚Äôs persuasions. When we got to his place we immediately went to bed, and at this point I was starting to feel physically ill and just wanted to sleep, but he kept groping me and wouldn‚Äôt listen when I said no, and would continue even after I would try to push him away. This went on for a long time and eventually I just caved in and let him do whatever he wanted, but I hated every moment and just wanted it to end. After he was done we fell asleep and I woke up a couple hours later feeling slightly more sober but extremely sick. Everything that had happened hit me all at once and I felt so disgusted with myself and just wanted to puke and then curl up in a ball of despair, but more than anything I wanted to be HOME! I got dressed and looked for my phone but I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere. I tried waking him up to ask him to call a taxi for me, but he just grunted and went back to sleep. After looking everywhere for my phone with no luck, I just left and decided I would try to find a business that was open where I could use their phone. It wasn‚Äôt light outside yet and I had no idea what time it was. I just walked down the street sobbing, pepper spray in hand, hyper vigilant of everything and everyone around me. I was so overcome with emotions and felt so vulnerable. At one point a guy started walking behind me and I started to panic, and turned around and told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt let you walk behind me‚Äù. Poor dude was probably so confused and shocked, just out for an early morning stroll only to have this random hysterical woman call him out for minding his own business. He didn‚Äôt say anything, but he did immediately cross the street and kept his distance. Eventually I walked by a restaurant that wasn‚Äôt open yet, but there were lights on and I could see people inside, so I went to the door and knocked. The employees were so incredibly sweet, they let me in, let me use their phone, and asked me if I wanted any coffee or water, and just genuinely made me feel less scared and alone in that moment. Eventually I made it home and had to tell my family what happened and apologize for losing my phone (we put up posters later the next day, and it was returned to me thankfully). My family were super concerned and also livid at me for not contacting them to have them come take me home. My sister said (half jokingly) that she was going to tattoo her number on my arm so I could call her any time day or night if I ever needed a ride. Honestly it had never occurred to me to contact them that night. The combination of alcohol, peer pressure, losing my phone, and it being the middle of the night I guess just made my brain not even consider them as an option.

So that‚Äôs the story of one of the worst nights of my life. The cherry on top was during my next shift at work and my coworkers asking me how it went, and when I told them about how awful it was, they had the audacity to make it seem like I was overreacting, and that it was no big deal. Needless to say I didn‚Äôt remain friends with them for much longer after that.

Anyway, after sharing that experience with my partner they told me I wasn‚Äôt raped because technically I consented by giving in and allowing it to happen. I know I made a lot of bad decisions, and put myself in a very avoidable situation. It was a combination of inebriation, peer pressure, and naivety, but I still believe I was taken advantage of, but maybe that doesn‚Äôt mean the same thing. Let me know your thoughts.

FYI, this happened over 10 years ago, so some details I may have forgotten, but I have learned and healed from the experience. I have been receiving regular health care for the past 5 years to help with my diagnosed mental illnesses and am slowly learning how to manage my issues. I also do not hold my partner‚Äôs opinion against them, I love them all the same, I‚Äôm just curious what others think. Thank you for reading.

I (24f) live with my mother and my older sister, i have an older brother as well, who lives away from us. My mother and I have had a very tense relationship for the past 4-5 years, and its only getting worse. I used to be very open with both of them, but now I just honestly never tell them much, especially my mom. I work two jobs, along with university. My first job is the actual full-time job (8hr shift, 6 days a week regular), i make between 650e and 750e a month, depending on how much I work, and I recently started working a second job, once a week, maybe twice, only nights which pays around 40e per shift. Both of these jobs bring in quite an amount, seeing as I live with two other people who also work and earn money, albeit a bit less than me.

My biggest issue with my mother is the fact that we simply cannot understand each other, or one of us refuses to. She, in my opinion, has a much closer relationship with my sister, they talk and hang out a lot, call each other while at work and such, but never think to even text me while I am at work. I often feel very left out, whenever I sit with them and just listen to them talk, it feels like they don't even notice I am there, I get interrupted when I say something, and then I just lose interest to repeat it when its my chance to talk again.

I started working when I was 19 and have stayed at the same job since then, the shifts are kinda messy but I don't mind it that much, because I always make time to see my friends after work, to go somewhere, I always make time if I want to do something. Recently, my mother has been a bit cruel to me, in multiple ways. Never physically, not anymore, but it often feels like she just doesn't care about me? I complained about my issues with her to my father and to my older brother, and they are both aware of everything. My older brother has this idea of helping us clear our stuff up, but at the same time, feels like we are just both very childish. They both say that I need to move out, that it would be a start. I planned on moving out, and last year in December, I told my mother and sister that, and my mother exploded. Claimed that I was taking away her parental rights, that she will remain a baggage for my older sister, implying that I will never talk to them again, never visit them again, never help in any way, be it financially or otherwise, and thats just not true. But I also feel like I need to move out, not just because I want to, but because I also feel like its a better option for us, to save what little relationship we have left. My sister understands me, she tries to explain that stuff to my mother, but she just refuses to. Whenever I go somewhere after work, i.e. go somewhere with friends, go out with my boyfriend, god forbid sleep over at his place, my mother claims that I am just a visitor in my own home, someone who just comes over to sleep. In the past few months, I have spent a bit more time out of my house, either sleeping over at my bfs, or coming home late, I guess to avoid confrontation. My mother now makes me feel like I cannot even ask for advice from someone else, not even my older brother, because she claims family business should stay at home, but I just feel so alone and I want someone to hear my side, to see my side.

The topic of money recently came up again. I make quite a lot of money, for our standards, and even if I lived alone, I would be fine. I have started looking for an actual job, something serious, in the past few months, something where I can use my knowledge of different languages, but I haven't found anything yet.
I wanted to move out, to live with my boyfriend (he now lives not even 5mins away from me) but my mother was greatly offended at that, and has guilted me by saying that they will also need to move, as they cannot afford this place without me. Even though I said that I will and want to still help with paying rent and such.
I recently expressed the desire to go to the gym, and I decided I can afford it, honestly, seeing as its less than 25e a month. I have, for a long while, felt like I explicitly work just to give them all the money, and nothing for me. I would have to ask them for money for the bus, for money to get coffee with friends, for anything. I decided recently to just keep something for myself every week, and still contribute to expenses. Even that is horrific to my mother, who acts as if there is no money for anything once I take even 15 fucking percent. 

I told both of them, a few years ago, that I need help. I have been struggling with mental health for a long time. I tried to commit suicide once, when I was younger, but didn't go through with it because of my friends who helped me. I feel horrible most of the time, I am zoned out most of the time, I sleep horribly, I am always just worn out, sad. I have moments where I wonder how to try again, how to make it work this time and be done with everything. My boyfriend is the one person that makes me honestly smile, just by being next to me. I have amazing friends,, people who mean the world to me, people who keep me alive. I told my mother and sister that I need professional help, and what I got in return was: ""You saw all your mental health problems on those tv shows you watch."" and ""You have no right to feel this way, you are only 24, what can I say, at this age, when I have actually experienced problems?"". Those two sentences stayed in my head since then, and I can't stop thinking about them.

We are now very tense, I spend maybe two or three nights at home, most I spend with my boyfriend. I love both of them, more than anything in this world and I always will. I cannot say that I haven't been cruel in my actions, that I have never pushed them away, that I have never done wrong by them, but I also cannot say that I deserve this.
This is a somewhat condensed version, there is a lot more but I feel like it would become too long, but I can answer anything additional. I just need advice, opinions about the whole situation.",1,1748508011.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I put a lot of work into this John Keal for Brown Saltman bench/coffee table and found comps online at other Los Angeles MCM furniture dealers for 3k plus. I usually assume those prices are a little over the top so I put in on Facebook for $1499 just to see what happened‚Ä¶nothing. I took some better pictures and decided I would be happy to sell it realistically for $450, so I listed it for $595. It would still be a big profit for me and I thought it would sell faster. Within minutes someone contacted me and asked to put down a $200 deposit, and sent it via Venmo right away. I was stoked, they said they were happy to pay full price for a refinished piece. I checked their Facebook Marketplace account and have found they are a huuuuge mcm furniture reseller of way higher priced pieces. I‚Äôm feeling sad, I was so excited and proud to have sold my first piece but feel like I sold too low. Maybe those $3000+ comps are real and I just don‚Äôt know enough yet and I should‚Äôve sat on it a while.

(After all, when have my Amazon browsing habits suggested an interest in replacement side mirrors for an ATV I don‚Äôt own‚Ä¶? My RFY has been so head-scratching with days of literally nothing I would want.)

So as a casual experiment, I made a new public Amazon wishlist and just started STACKING it with all my dream stuff. I recently had a friend get a mini tabletop smokeless fire pit as a gift and I thought ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs fucking cool,‚Äù so on the wishlist it went. I like home decor and trying to get my shit better organized, on the list went a million organizers. (Along with small appliances, coffee gear, home decor shit and more.)

A day later, I accidentally wake up alarmless for my monkey brain‚Äôs 4am ‚Äúomg FOMO‚Äù RFY check (this is all still very new and novel) and there are THREE different tabletop fire pits and a two-tier shelf organizer in my RFY. 

Not incredibly high value items or anything but they‚Äôre literally specifically dupes of things on my Amazon wishlist, so very high value to *me‚Ä¶* and that feels just too on-the-nose to be pure coincidence. üò±
