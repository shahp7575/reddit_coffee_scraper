I'm upgrading to my very first espresso maker at home. I visited a store near my place in Switzerland and the following two models caught my eye -

1. Ascaso Uno Paid (~1400 EUR)
2. Lelit Victoria (~1000 EUR)

I've heard of Lelit as a silent lurker recently on this sub. Ascaso seems quite modern and well made but it's a new name for me. Wife loves the Ascaso design, and the ease of filling water.

My requirements are the best espresso I can get for my money, ease of use for someone who's getting into this game purely as a beginner enthusiast. I don't need hot water necessarily but do need steam.

So, please advise me on which one you'd prefer and why, and if I should actually consider something else, or go yolo and buy a Bianca which is slightly over my budget.

Do you also have a recommended grinder under 500$ ?

No apology.

I fell back to sleep almost immediately  for 4 hours (I didn‚Äôt get up until noon!) which is a win for me these days.

I have had weird chronic inflammation in my right jaw that has not gone away for months despite trying anti-inflammatory diet, NSAIDS that were so strong they made me sick, muscle relaxers and acupuncture.

They did not warn me about any potential side effects all they instructed me to do was to avoid coffee while I was on the steroids cause it might make me jittery. I had to call them Day 7 of the 13 day course because I was so sick digestively from the medication as well as having very bad palpitations, not sleeping more than 3 hours a night, shaking and just generally feeling unwell I had to miss multiple days of work.

What I Had:

I had Blood & Bourbon Cocktail, the Potato Taquitos, Truffle Garlic Fries, and the Short Rib Grilled Cheese. The Blood & Bourbon is Marker‚Äôs Mark, blood orange, Averna, Peychaud‚Äôs Bitters, and Luxardo Cherry Syrup. The cocktail was nice and well balanced between sweet and smokey with a kiss of bitters. The Potato Taquitos are mashed potatoes and mozzarella taquitos, plated on a heaping of guacamole, chile de arbol salsa, topped with queso fresco and micro cilantro. Cool vegetarian take on taquitos that worked really well ‚Äì the taquitos were fried nicely and the flavors all melded well together with the queso fresco tying it all together. My only note is that the guac tastes like the prepacked stuff from Costco, you know the one, lacking a fresh flavor and with too much lime to keep it from browning. 

[Short Rib Grilled Cheese](https://preview.redd.it/vw1rz2wsrosd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89eb3455ee1254c5be2fc9f766ebd7e08301b686)

The Short Rib Grilled Cheese is a cheese blend, caramelized onions, shredded short ribs, Fresno chili, chipotle aioli, all on toasted sourdough with a side of tomato soup (for dipping). Wow, this sandwich is packed with meat, cheese, and onions on perfectly toasted bread. The chipotle aioli gives a little kick that I thought was coming from the tomato soup, either way, the sandwich is great on its own, but when dipped in to the slightly viscous tomato soup, everything in concert with on another, makes for an amazing bite! The side of Truffle Garlic Fries were alright, not enough garlic of truffle oil to be more than hints against the potato-y strength of the beer battered fries. Still good, but definitely made for someone who isn‚Äôt a garlic lover.



Would I Have It Again:

Yes. It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve been to 1865, the last time I was here I didn‚Äôt have the best experience and while they offer a lot of trendy cuisine, it‚Äôs all routed through the lens of a craft eatery when I want something more authentic and down to Earth (which is my hang-up, not their‚Äôs).

I‚Äôve been diagnosed T2 for about 4 years now and also have ADHD, & probably apnea (getting a sleep study done this week). 
In that 4 years, my most common medication cocktail has been 200mg modafinil at 7am, 5mg adderall at noon, 5mg adderall at 4pm, and 20mg lexapro at night. More on this later. 

I used to be SO good about setting a nighttime routine and having good sleep hygiene. However about 6 months ago I picked up a 2nd job waiting tables on the weekend out of financial necessity. That means for 6 months I‚Äôve been working from 4pm - 2am Saturdays and 10-4pm Sundays (sometimes later) which very obviously messes with my sleep schedule. 

About a month ago, my modafinil just completely stopped working and I was falling asleep any time I was sitting down. This has lead to coffee and sugar free redbull addictions which aren‚Äôt great given that I‚Äôm on 2 stimulants. Went to my psych and my sleep specialist and now I am on 250mg armodafinil, 10mg Wellbutrin, and 20mg lexapro. This has been phenomenal for my depression, but my adhd and narcolepsy have been unaffected, even with the stronger stimulant. This leads me to believe my issue is solely my sleep schedule. 

Cut to earlier this week, I was laid off from my main job (budget cuts) and will be losing my health insurance at the end of the month. 

I have picked up extra shifts waiting tables while I look for a new job but mostly I am wondering what kind of sleep schedule works for people who serve at bars/bartenders/anyone who has a late night job? 

Do I set a routine for the 4pm-2am schedule while I‚Äôm looking for another main job? Or do I stick to a 10-7 sleep schedule on the days I am able?

Hey all. I‚Äôve been made aware by a mutual friend that one of my old friends posted on here about 2 hours ago about not calling me by my nickname. This is my side of the story. 

So, I (21M) and my friend, let‚Äôs call him Jim, (21M) met back in preschool when we were about 6 months old. We attended the preschool together until we both went to primary school at 4y/o, (we went to the same primary school) where we remained close friends. Over the several years we knew each other we developed a very close bond, becoming literally inseparable and always having sleepovers and play dates. He moved to the other side of the town towards the end of Year 6, and his parents decided to send him to a secondary school that was closer to him than the local one by my house, meaning we went to different secondary schools. We made different friends at different times and gradually lost contact over the next 5 years following. One of my friends that I made in year 7, who is now my best friend, let‚Äôs call him Oliver, actually has a speech impediment. This means he finds it very difficult to pronounce my name, Dominic. Due to his struggle saying my name, I now have the nickname Dom. I'd never realised that Dom was short for Dominic, and I started liking the name, which is why I now prefer being called Dom instead of Dominic. Oliver stayed with me by my side throughout the whole time we spent in secondary school, even when I was going through a pretty bad time mentally, which Jim still doesn‚Äôt know about. Following us all finishing school around 5 years ago, i managed to get back into contact with Jim. We met up at a local coffee shop and talked about life and what had been going on in each other‚Äôs lives. I told him about Oliver and his speech impediment, and that I prefer being called Dom. Jim didn‚Äôt take this well. He told me how I sounded like someone he didn‚Äôt know, how I was now a stranger, how he couldn‚Äôt shake off the habit of referring to me as ‚ÄòDominic‚Äô. To his credit, he cooled down a bit and for about a week following our meet-up, he did actually refer to me as ‚ÄòDom‚Äô, with the occasional accidental ‚ÄòDominic‚Äô. This didn‚Äôt last long. After this week or two, Jim said he ‚Äúcouldn't do this anymore‚Äù and how I ‚Äúwas acting irrationally‚Äù and that I should just let being called ‚ÄòDominic‚Äô slide. We ended up quarrelling for about 30 minutes at my place and he stormed off to his apartment (we live 10 minute walks away from each other). I‚Äôm not speaking to him anymore because of this, and he‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm being an unreasonable arsehole and that I should apologise. AITAH? ",1,1728157887.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I'm sorry but I didn't like him in their first appearance and I still do not. Rob seems to demand a level of authority and respect that he hasn't really earned. He and Tennie are both very deliberate with their wording on camera and it comes off as very inauthentic, so I know things are much more troubled than these two present. Rob is so calculating, but honestly so is his bitch of a mother. I do wonder if she and Rob are enmeshed, or if Kate is lazy and wants to live off of her son and therefore resents Tennie and her kids because Rob cares for them financially. Not to condone violence, but with the way Kate was shooting daggers with her eyes and making snarky little comments, I hope that Tennie got one good punch in. And I hope Cheyenne and Nehemiah get bored one afternoon and decide to throw the house cameras out the window.

It is interesting to see how Britney and Bianca are about the same age, but Britney seems years more mature than the latter (not to say that Britney hasn't had immature mindsets in the past). I feel for them about not getting the travel pass approved to Texas, but clearly they did not have all their ducks in a row, as Kerok stated, because getting approved to relocate is one of the ducks! Also, was Britney wearing silk pajamas to the mechanic shop...?

I hope that we only get like one more episode of Bianca because her behavior isn't cute or amusing. I'm willing to bet that she grew up spoiled and that she left her parents house because she wanted to continue to continue acting like she is smarter than everyone and to be a spoiled brat on her terms. I'm not crazy about Daniel, but he did handle that coffee/manipulation conversation with maturity and I hope that he nopes out of the relationship sooner than later. She clearly is only with him anyway because of his looks (her words--I respectfully disagree) and she even complained about that!

I hope that Kim's older son is not Joey's. He doesn't deserve to have two absolute zeros as his parents. And side note; I feel like the more we hear from Joey's mom, the more I feel like she is only supportive of Kim and Joey's relationship because she is sick of his shit and the rest of his family (except for his niece) have no contact with him.

We are of course devastated but thankfully the doctors caught it very early and it seems that it will be able to be treated easily.


However, something strange has been happening since then.

Right when we got the diagnosis in the hospital my wife was handed some pamphlets about how husbands will leave as soon as their wives show even a hint of cancer. It was like pamphlets that talked about resources and such available to ill women whose husbands leave.
When I innocently told the nurse that my wife didn‚Äôt need them she looked at me with disgust and then took my wife‚Äôs hands and gently reminded her to keep these brochures and not to be ashamed to reach out for help.
Okay that was strange but maybe it happens often enough that this is necessary. Also the nurse definitely gave me big misandrist vibes (she was rather unattractive).


The strangeness continued when my coworkers and friends found out about this. Every male friend and acquaintance I have immediately high fived me upon hearing the news and asked me if I had already begun the divorce proceedings or if I‚Äôd rather look for a mistress first so I don‚Äôt end up being single and neglected while I divorce my wife.

Some even confessed to *giving* their wives cancer so that they could be justified in leaving them. I am not sure how they did it precisely but we do work at a nuclear power plant so I assume some light dusting of uranium in the wife‚Äôs morning coffee or something.


But the worst is that my in laws contacted me and let me know that they are 100% on my side if I decide to leave my wife and that her much younger and more attractive (and cancer free) sister would be ready to move in as soon as I kick my cancer stricken wife out of the house.


Listen guys I will be completely honest. I am a good man. But it has been a week now since we found out and quite frankly my wife has not been giving me a lot of sex or even romantic affection. 
I try to not let outsiders influence my relationship too much (that‚Äôs why I post about it on reddit) but I have been thinking more and more about this since all these people brought it up to me.

I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+. Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something super serious, nor am I looking to relocate or anything like that. 

If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Tell me a bit about yourself! I will ignore any single word responses - ‚Äúhey‚Äù does not start a conversation. ",3,1728156416.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

","So for a bit of context about 4 years ago I had a huge crush on this guy and I think the feelings were reciprocated. Whilst nothing ever actually happened I think we both knew there was always something there. Anyway, after we finished college and moved back to different states we naturally drifted apart. We‚Äôd still send the odd ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù Text a couple of times a year but that spark wasn‚Äôt really there anymore. I also now have a boyfriend, who I‚Äôve been with for three years. So my problem is my old crush has recently reached out asking if I wanna go for a coffee, as I‚Äôve now moved for a job and live in the same state as him. Part of me wants to go as I‚Äôm genuinely interested in how he‚Äôs doing but part of me feels like I‚Äôm betraying my boyfriend. As much as I‚Äôd plan on telling my now boyfriend I was going to see him and I‚Äôd be very transparent about my relationship status with the old guy, I‚Äôm still aware of the feelings I used to have and how strong they were. I guess part of me is worried they‚Äôd return if I saw him again‚Ä¶

Any guys help would massively be appreciated as well, do you think he genuinely might just be asking for a ‚Äúcatchup‚Äù or do you think there‚Äôs some ulterior motive and he‚Äôs thinking now we‚Äôre a bit older there might be a chance for us??? 

Note-I‚Äôll also throw it out there my current boyfriend has an EXTREMELY relaxed attitude about girl/boy friendships so much so he even has a girl best friend and loads of other close girl friends, so part of me is thinking maybe I should just go for it as he has a lot of girlfriends??

1. **SAP Noob**: Thinks ""SAP"" is something you collect from trees. Struggles with the SAP GUI, occasionally wonders if it‚Äôs frozen or if that‚Äôs just how it is. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an ABAP?‚Äù
2. **T-Code Explorer**: Has a cheat sheet of common t-codes and can navigate SAP Fiori apps with only moderate confusion. Knows the difference between ECC and S/4HANA but still calls Basis for help... a lot.
3. **Config Dabbler**: Has dabbled in SPRO and feels like a wizard setting up a company code. Gets a thrill out of ticking checkboxes in IMG and occasionally talks about ‚Äúenhancements‚Äù like they know what they mean.
4. **Module Wrangler**: Specializes in one SAP module like MM or SD and loves dropping acronyms in conversations. ‚ÄúOh, yeah, just change the condition type in the pricing procedure and you‚Äôll be golden.‚Äù
5. **ABAP Whisperer**: Can tweak custom reports in ABAP without breaking a sweat. Prefers talking in tables like MARA, BSEG, and EKPO. Debugging is their cardio. Might have written a custom Z program or two.
6. **Transport Guru**: Has moved transports across clients more times than they‚Äôve had coffee. Feels no fear staring at a transport request log in STMS and knows how to deal with TR conflicts like a pro. Can recite the sequence of DEV-QA-PROD in their sleep.
7. **Fiori Designer**: Gets a dopamine hit from customizing Fiori tiles and creating slick dashboards with KPI tiles. Talks about OData services and CDS views like they‚Äôre casual small talk. Thinks SAP Fiori Elements are ‚Äúkinda cute.‚Äù
8. **S/4HANA Sage**: Has fully embraced the world of S/4HANA and preaches the benefits of HANA‚Äôs in-memory database to anyone who‚Äôll listen. Considers SAP Activate and Best Practices sacred texts. Smirks whenever someone mentions the old SAP ERP days.
9. **Integration Ninja**: Fluent in SAP PI/PO, and possibly some weird combination of middleware that shouldn‚Äôt work but does. Connects SAP to third-party systems with SOAP and REST APIs like it‚Äôs no big deal. BAPI, RFC? They‚Äôre on it.
10. **SAP God-tier Architect**: Designs end-to-end global landscapes that span multiple SAP modules, integrates legacy systems, and ensures smooth rollouts. Can optimize complex pricing procedures while fending off change requests from a CFO.

So I (28F) have been seeing this guy (29M) for over a month now. He DM'd me on Insta and quickly after asked me out on a date. On the first date he was quite open about looking for something more serious and told me he's not usually DM-ing girls like this, that he ended a long relationship half a year ago and I seemed really nice and charming and he wanted to meet me. 

We have went on 4 dates now, and dates are going really well. He asks me a lot questions about myself, we are very comfortable with talking about our lives, families and interests, jobs etc., we usually go on walks or for coffee or drinks. He even made a suggestion of going on a day trip to a city few hours away. 

The thing is, we don't text, almost at all. He seemed to put more effort in texting around first 2 dates, he would ask me about my day, send me memes, but now that's literally once a week. I started trying to continue the conversation, but he would leave me on delivered for several days. We also see each other once a week, while first 2 dates happened in the same week. Last date was few days ago, and the one before that was 2 weeks before. This kind of makes me feel like he is losing interest because we live 15 mins from each other and he's currently unemployed (have to make it clear he only recently left his job and is currently interviewing for other jobs lol). He did suggest seeing each other again next week.

I do admit I can appear a bit reserved because I haven't dated in a long time, but I am starting to get more comfortable around him, I even initiated the first kiss. But even with this, I feel like I still haven't really ""broken the ice"" because he is still very cautious when leaning for a kiss which only makes me nervous and I panic not knowing if he wants a kiss on the cheek or an actual kiss lol Which I guess then makes me look like I'm avoiding the kiss and he moved away and said ""it's fine, I'm not going to force you into it"" and I tried to explain he confuses me. 

I really like him, but don't want to open up about my feelings if he's not that interested, should I just move on or try to talk to him about, but I also don't want to seem clingy or like I'm already complaining?",3,1728155292.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

I am thinking of FIREing soon, and I find myself often thinking that if I feel a need for a little extra cash, I could just pick up some holiday work at Target, or work for the REI Co-op across the street.  And in some sort of romantic way, it sounds like it could be fun.  

But then I think back to the retail and customer service jobs I had in my teens and early 20s (McDonalds, supermarkets, call centers)...which all kind of sucked. I mean, my experiences weren't all bad.  But most of my good memories are of spending time with fun coworkers.  Dealing with customers was often difficult, and my sense is that retail workers have it worse since the pandemic. 

So is this really a viable backup option? I mean, if I'm unhappy at my current office job, isn't it likely that I wouldn't be happy at some type of retail job? 

BTW, I realize this would sound privileged and obnoxious outside of a FIRE sub.  Obviously people are often in a situation where they need to get a job anywhere so they can bring in some income, and I feel a lot of empathy for that situation. ",41,1728155188.0,Fire,22,0.96,False

So the last couple of days have been wildly emotional for me. I have a partner who is mad that I went on a bender. I have told her that I have AUD.  
I guess because she doesn‚Äôt know much first she suggested moderating and not getting drunk. Anyway hey let‚Äôs just go against what every single episode of intervention etc says. 

Anyway fast forward to today. Day 5 and she says because I have no way of knowing if you will be blind drunk or not. You can‚Äôt be in the room. Normally I don‚Äôt mind I just use the guest room to rest. But today the nanny was ironing in there and I just wanted to take a nap. 
So I left and spent the day driving around eating decent food drinking coffee coke and sparkling water. 

Now I get back home and who has been busy drinking. Leaves a bottle of wine under the counter that‚Äôs half consumed. 
I mean honestly I saw it and instantly my mind was like one sip. But sober October is so important to me I walked away. 

I don‚Äôt know if she just doesn‚Äôt understand AUD. But the voices in my head are saying oh well no ways you could possibly get caught today she has had a tonne already. 

I know my sobriety is my own, but cut me a break. I guess I just wish she could calm down so I could talk to her a little more. I don‚Äôt expect her to change her lifestyle on account of me.

1. DP is a 100% normal disassociation symptoms that gets triggered by your brain when the sympathetic nervous system (fight, flight or freeze response) is triggered. It usually lasts around 60min or until the threat is gone and tour brain signals your body that the treat is gone so the sympathetic nervous system can switch off. 

2. Long term DP: if your DP lasts for longer than 60minutes this means your brain identified something internal as a threat (Like lack of oxygen in my case). I thought I was having a heart attack because my heart started racing and my brain triggered a fight or flight response because it thought surely this guy is in trouble because he is hyperventilating (short breathing) and his heart is pulsing wildly. 

3. When my heart rate went down the DP stayed. So the only other threat my body identified that night was my hyperventilation (shallow breathing). When you hyperventilate less oxygen reaches your brain. This can trigger a fight or flight response because your brain is hyper aware and fragile at that stage so It perceives the lack of oxygen as a threat. 

4. In my case I was hyperventilating and I had low Haemoglobin in my blood (the stuff responsible for transporting oxygen to the brain). So it had a double effect on my brain oxygen. Even after hundreds of test and oximeter tests no doctor ever picked this up. 

5. My DP went away when I solved the following equation:    Anxiety + Low oxygen to the brain + traumatic event = Long term DP

I wish I knew this sooner instead of just ignoring it. 

The Cure: 

1. Re train your body to breath properly (start taking deep breaths again (Diaphragm breathing)
2. Do progressive relaxation meditations 
3. Re build your haemoglobin levels to transport more oxygen to the brain ( Iron supplements, 20 min of cardio, carnivore diet) 

Edit: Supplement List 
- Liposomal Iron (100mg pd)
- Vitamin B12 and Folate (combo) 
- Hight dose Zinc 
- Magnesium Glycerinate
- Diet (Carnivore & Keto Diet) 
- Omega 3 (raw salmon oil) 
- 1.5 L of water per day with electrolytes

Eliminate Immediately until you are 80%+ cured: 
- Any stimulant (Coffee, Caffeine, Smoking, Alcohol, Energy drinks) 
- No Sugar

The first thing I do is check the tracking website, and I realize that almost all the other riders pushed through the first night without sleeping. That surprises me. Because it‚Äôs my first race and I have no experience, my plan was not to rush things at the beginning. This decision will later come back to me. I quickly pack up my things, carry my bike down the stairs, and set off on the first day. The route starts flat, passing through Belgium, then the Netherlands and then crossing into Germany near Aachen. At this point in the race, two main groups have already formed. In the months before, I decided to take a flatter but longer route through Germany. At 17:00 pm, it‚Äôs time for lunch, so I grab 5 burgers, fries, ice cream, and coffee at Burger King. After that, I hit the only climb of the day, heading towards Wiesbaden. Everything still feels familiar at this point, and I believe I made the right choice with this route. At 23:00 pm, I stock up on cola and snacks at a sp√§ti. For this night, I had already planned a good sleeping spot in advance, but to reach it, I‚Äôd have to ride until early morning again. So, I decide not stick to my sleep plan and look for a place to sleep on the go. Because I can‚Äôt find anything suitable in the next hour, I check Google Maps again and find a playground with a roof. When I get there, there were still people around. So, I move on to a second spot, but it‚Äôs full of mosquitoes. Not a great place for a quiet sleep. So, I continue on to a lake with a shelter. I arrive there at 1:45 am.

This happened when our first baby was born and it's happening again. I went to so much therapy to deal with PPD last time, but I don't think this is in my control at all. My husband is literally doing the bare minimum but thinks he's going above and beyond and it's driving me insane. We finally got past him having his parents over for our first 2 days home against my will and we had a few good days but yesterday and today have been a nightmare.

For example. I've been taking nights every night since we got home from the hospital (baby is 2 weeks old now). The last 2 nights LO hasn't slept well at all and by 3am I needed just an hour of sleep so I tagged my husband in. He spent 2 hours with our newborn and after that I went back because I had to feed him. In the morning, my husband put 2 pieces of bread on a plate and a Kuriig coffee, and took our toddler outside so he wouldn't be banging on my door so I could 'sleep'. They were outside from around 730am-930am, which is my routine with toddler on any given day (I'm a SAHM). Later on I cleaned the house because it's disgusting and I cooked dinner because I need some actual nutrients and not takeout again. I did this with the baby in the wrap and my husband was playing with our toddler and toddler also took a 3 hour nap. Being 2 weeks postpartum I know this is a dumb idea but we have no outside help and I can't live in the filth anymore. When we sat to eat my husband ate his whole meal and didn't say anything. I'm not expecting a lot but literally a simple 2 word 'thank you' would have made my entire day. I said jokingly 'thanks (my name)!' and he said oh yea thank you. That started an argument that I 'stole his thunder' because he was going to say it. He said he has a lot on his mind including stuff for work which I don't have to think about since I don't work (SAHM).

We have talked at length before about how I need to ask for what I need instead of thinking he'll read my mind. But literally every time I do, he gets annoyed at me. I had to hand him the baby so I could use the bathroom, which spurred an eye roll and mean comment that made me feel so selfish for needing to just use the bathroom for 30 seconds. Then I'm sitting with the baby trying to get him to nurse and my husband comes over with a coffee for himself and didn't think to ask if I want something to drink. Then the final straw for me was our baby woke up screaming and I was trying to nurse him again (feeding issues) and realized I forgot a burp cloth. He was sitting on the couch on his phone and I said in the nicest way I could think of as to not damage his ego, would you mind getting me a burp cloth when I'm feeding him, I always forget to grab one and it'd be helpful if you can take care of that for me. He rolled his eyes and got it for me but then had this huge smirk. I asked why he's doing that and he said I asked it in a really rude way. That kind of set me off because I went out of my way to ask as nicely as possible.

It seems like if I don't ask for help, I get blamed for assuming he'll read my mind. But if I do ask for help, I get cursed at, talked down to, and made to feel like I'm asking for way too much. I brought this up to him and his response was to list all the things he did for me yesterday and today, including 'making me breakfast' (2 slices of untoasted bread on a plate). I don't think he grasps that having had a baby 2 weeks ago, I'm still healing and bleeding way more than I should be still because I'm up cooking and cleaning for him.

I don't know what to do. The only thing I can think of is to completely stop asking for help and basically live like a single parent. I don't know when it's safe to ask for help and when it will be thrown back in my face. He tried to apologize but it's the same thing I've heard over and over and it means nothing anymore. I feel sick because the first things our baby is hearing of my voice is me arguing with my husband.",1,1728154645.0,beyondthebump,3,1.0,False

1fwxijn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fwxijn,Transcontinental Race No. 10 // recap // day 1,"After about 2 hours, the night is already over. The first thing I do is check the tracking website, and I realize that almost all the other riders pushed through the first night without sleeping. That surprises me. Because it‚Äôs my first race and I have no experience, my plan was not to rush things at the beginning. This decision will later come back to me. I quickly pack up my things, carry my bike down the stairs, and set off on the first day. The route starts flat, passing through Belgium, then the Netherlands and then crossing into Germany near Aachen. At this point in the race, two main groups have already formed. In the months before, I decided to take a flatter but longer route through Germany. At 17:00 pm, it‚Äôs time for lunch, so I grab 5 burgers, fries, ice cream, and coffee at Burger King. After that, I hit the only climb of the day, heading towards Wiesbaden. Everything still feels familiar at this point, and I believe I made the right choice with this route. At 23:00 pm, I stock up on cola and snacks at a sp√§ti. For this night, I had already planned a good sleeping spot in advance, but to reach it, I‚Äôd have to ride until early morning again. So, I decide not stick to my sleep plan and look for a place to sleep on the go. Because I can‚Äôt find anything suitable in the next hour, I check Google Maps again and find a playground with a roof. When I get there, there were still people around. So, I move on to a second spot, but it‚Äôs full of mosquitoes. Not a great place for a quiet sleep. So, I continue on to a lake with a shelter. I arrive there at 1:45 am. The whole process cost me a lot of time and I‚Äôm determined that it won‚Äôt happen again.

1fwxhwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1fwxhwr/thoughts_on_2024_coffee_festival/,Thoughts on 2024 Coffee Festival,"Hello! My family and i returned from the coffee fest and I have to say i was pretty disappointed. I've been attending since 2021 (technically 2020 but they did a take home box). Most years my daughter (who is now almost 6 and does not drink coffee) and boyfriend have joined me. This year, they changed the venue to the Franklin County Fair Grounds since the Ohio Village is getting renovated. Below is just my feedback but what did anyone else who went think?

The pros:
- I love the color story for this year's mug
- the vendors were super nice, as always
- they had a tattoo pop-up shop (I had to fight myself to not get one but I'm poor)
- lots of space to walk
- tons of food options (way more than years prior)
- lots of seating by the food trucks

The cons:
- getting there was confusing due to no signage (I live in Hilliard and trying to get there was a mess)
- more merch vendors than coffee vendors to where it was noticeable
- little to no kid friendly activities (I know this isn't a kids event, but the other venue at least has a playground, and a ton of people bring their kids to this event)
- venue lacked charm like the ohio village (my opinion and not much they can do about this one)
- they overstuffed the indoor areas with vendors to where it was hard to get around 
- lack of seating anywhere outside the food area

Overall the most disappointing thing was the lack of coffee. We felt like we had to search for it between the other merch vendors. We ended up staying only for 40 minutes. In that 40 minutes we sampled pretty much every coffee vendor (we did not sample the fig coffee or silver bridge). I probably won't attend again if they keep it at the fair grounds.

Should I (34F) tell him that he needs to start helping before he gets fired? If I must tell him, how do I do it so he knows we're upset because of his behavior and not his autism?","Hey! I need some advice on if I should tell a coworker at the retirement home where we work who uses his diagnosis to shirk his chores that we're tired of his behavior and how I can say it so it doesn't sound offensive? This is going to be a long one and I'll include a TLDR at the end.

Apologies if this isn't the best sub but I'm out of ideas of where to post.

For the record: his autism is¬†***NOT***¬†the problem.

We have another coworker who also has autism (I'm calling him Kevin, 19M). Kevin needs more time to get stuff done and you have to show him how to do something a couple of times when he's learning how to do something. But he's a hard worker, is the first to volunteer to take out the trash or clear the tables or mop the floor or whatever we need and he is thorough. He's also a friendly and cheerful sort who knows everyone's drink order by heart and has them ready as they're entering the dining room. Kevin is very popular with the residents as well as the rest of the workers. I told Kevin (and I meant it) that he was one of my favorite coworkers because he always had a smile on his face and isn't afraid to help. He was grinning the rest of the day.

I can work with Kevin and good workers until the cows come home.

The coworker in question (let's call him John) is the total opposite. He does everything and anything he can to not do his tasks. Earlier today, he complained to our boss that he can't do dishes or wash the tables after meals because ""the water dries out my hands and the sensation hurts my hands"" (we have unscented lotion available for our dishwashers for that reason and I know he knows about it because he showed me where it was my first day). Boss (75M) and I just gave each other an exasperated look and later Boss told me he wanted to sarcastically ask John how he was able to take a shower every day.

John is supposed to help keep our coffee pots full and our creamer bowls stocked in addition to the cereal dispensers (we have them out so the residents can have cereal if they don't want to have what we are serving for the day) and the bread boxes for toast (we also have them out so they can have toast). Every single time I work the dinner shift and John's been on the clock, I have to restock the creamers and brew more coffee. Everything needs to be done before dinner so we can get right to serving it as the cooks are off at 3PM (Dinner is served at 4 PM).

When John isn't working, he's on his phone. When one of us asks him for help, he grumbles and gets up and puts in a half hearted attempt that we usually have to end up fixing later. One time I asked him to go to the cooler downstairs and get two gallons of milk so we'd have enough for supper. He said he would and left. I returned to what I was doing and twenty minutes later, he said he was done for the day (which he was). I asked him if he got the milk like I asked him to. He said ""oh...no...I didn't...autism brain"" and promptly left without offering to get the milk. I had to run down and grab them so there'd be milk ready, which took time out of the things I needed to do.

I normally work nights and weekends (when John is off) so I don't have to deal with him much. However, there's been a few times when we're shortstaffed in the kitchen and I get called in. I'm okay with it because it's more money and because I like my coworkers for the most part.

Or rather, I was okay with it.

Two days ago, I found out from one of the housekeepers (42F, who was sent to get me as I live on the property) that we were short one person (we need two helpers in the kitchen in addition to the cook to ensure meals are served promptly and everything is done). I needed the money so I went downstairs to the kitchen to pitch in.

I get there at 10:30 AM. Lunch is to be served at 11 AM. John is on his phone as it's his break. I ask him what needs to be done...and he tells me that the bathrooms on the first floor hadn't been cleaned (the kitchen assistants clean them between breakfast and lunch. One takes care of the bathrooms on the second floor and one takes care of the bathrooms on the first floor. And these are pretty good sized bathrooms).

I asked him in a kind voice when the other kitchen helper went home (sometimes it happens). He told me he had been by himself since that morning and that he had called me. I asked why he didn't leave a voicemail or text. He said ""they make me uncomfortable"". I asked him why he waited until the last minute to send one of the housekeepers up to get me. He told me ""I don't know"". And I asked ""How am I going to get four bathrooms clean in half an hour?"" Again, he said ""I don't know"" and went right back to his phone.

I checked the bathrooms and thank God all that needed to be done was to take out the trash. If one of them had been a disaster zone, we would've been late serving lunch because I would've been cleaning that up instead of helping in the kitchen.

At that point, I was done. I have been dealing with his laziness since February and I didn't want to be taken advantage of anymore. So I told my other coworkers and Boss that unless and until John starts pulling his weight in the kitchen, I wasn't helping out in the mornings anymore.

A couple of my coworkers were upset about it (one, 28F, because she's friends with John and the other, 45M, because he's got to deal with John by himself now). But the others (and more importantly, Boss) were supportive. The Boss said he was going to talk to John about his behavior (he's gotten reports from other workers too about John's behavior) but that he understood.

There's a whole bunch of other issues with John but the main issue is him using his autism as an excuse to not work.

I have a brother and several family members who have autism. I know it can be difficult. I'm willing to help come up with solutions or swap chores if it makes your working life easier. But at least show that you are willing to put the effort in. I don't think that's much to ask for.

The Boss is a fair man who will give you the last dollar in his pocket if you needed it but he's can be blunt. Not mean. But blunt. I'm worried that John will take the upcoming lecture not very well and will take every opportunity to complain (mainly to me because I seem to be the coworker people come to with problems and I'm generally okay with that). I also know that John is on thin ice and will get fired if he doesn't shape up. The Boss has given him too many chances.

I may have my issues with John. But the economy is in bad shape right now. If I didn't have this job, I'd probably still be living in my car and wondering where my next meal was coming from. Having autism makes it rougher to find and keep a good job, especially when you don't know what the problem is. Being homeless for almost 2 years was absolutely terrifying and I don't want to subject anyone to that. Even John.

So for my question: if John complains to me about the lecture, should I tell him that the issue is his actions and that he's burning his bridges? And if I should tell him, how should I do it so he knows the issue is his behavior and not his autism?

Any advice would be helpful, please and thank you.

TLDR: Coworker uses his autism diagnosis to shirk work and is on thin ice at our job. Should I tell him when he complains to me that the issue is his behavior NOT his autism or should I let him get fired and risk not finding a better job as a result?",0,1728154413.0,autism,7,0.25,False

My husband sees it as him trying to help me be the best I can be, giving me everything I need to be successful. I have examples on previous posts that contradict that. When I told him about it being emotional abuse, he said it's the classic American feminist mentality that my therapist is instilling in me, and there are two sides to the tortilla. He said he's always been here for me and wants nothing but the best for me.

Anyway, today there was another 2 hour lecture (he expressed his feelings for literally 2 hours). Usually it makes me sad. He mentioned divorce ( not him divorcing me but me divorcing him). He didn't get a reaction out of me at all like he usually does (sad and mad).

So after the conversation he acted very differently. He acted nice.

When was that last time he invited me out to do something, besides a coffee? (Maybe April?)
Now suddenly that my parents are coming up for a week, he cares about what I'm doing?

 Today he wanted to get coffee with me. The last time he asked me to get a coffee was at least 2 months ago, probably more. 

Tomorrow, he knows I have plans with my parents...for at least church and lunch. Now, he asks, ""what are you doing tomorrow in the afternoon? I'm in the mood to play pool. Just you and me.""

Hmmmmm, why now suddenly that my parents are coming up? Plus he already said he's going to go to church and possibly lunch with his friends (his own church with his single, younger, friends who are male and female). Now suddenly he wants to change my brakes (one has been shot for 3 weeks) and cut the grass. He'll say its because he didnt have time and money before, but are we sure? Are you sure it isnt because of my parents? Does he not want them to see how it really is?

Why is he now talking to me more today after the original 2 hour conversation...and subtly complimenting me or saying what i want to hear (our son is really interested in basketball. Maybe we can go to the ymca and you can teach him. I told him im not very good at it, but that you are.""

""This chili is really really good. Make sure you dont give it away when everyone's done. If there's any leftover, i want it.""

He would say its all a coincidence. But i wonder if there is some subconscious manipulation

1.	Atomoxetine/Strattera: Surprisingly worked almost immediately and lasted all day. Felt more like a stimulant than actual stimulants. It suppressed my appetite, raised my BP, and made me anxious. And if I missed a dose I got super irritable. It also gave me a ‚Äúfloppy noodle,‚Äù so had to stop despite being super productive.

2- Concerta: Great for hyperactivity, which is my main problem. Helped with focus too but sometimes put me in hyperfocus on the wrong stuff. Didn‚Äôt last all day like Strattera and was super dependent on what I ate. Unfortunately it is expensive and hard to find.

3- Modafinil/Armodafinil: Just kept me awake and more hyper. No physical effects, like super coffee without the jitters. Still prefer energy drinks‚Äîtastes better and easier to control.

4- Bupropion: Better than nothing. Made me emotional at first, but subtle for ADHD. Great for binge eating though‚Äîonly this and Atomoxetine helped with that.

5- Adderall: Honestly, not a fan. Made me sleepy and killed my appetite for a while, but then it bounced back, making my binge eating worse. I think it was too effective at reducing my hyperactivity‚Äîsitting still for long hours made me tired. I was super productive, even more than on methylphenidate, but I didn‚Äôt like the personality change or feeling extra calm (aka sleepy/tired).

6- Ritalin IR: My favorite so far. Like Concerta, but doesn‚Äôt last as long, so I can break out of hyperfocus before wasting a whole day. Milder comedown than Adderall and doesn‚Äôt flatten my personality. Can still get sidetracked (like writing this post when I should be studying)

7- Honorable Mentions:
7.1) Pre-workout: Bad idea due to crazy anxiety, palpitations, and a worse crash than Adderall.
7.2) L-Tyrosine: Subtle but decent. Maybe placebo, but no harm in trying.  ",12,1728153778.0,ADHD,29,0.8,False

¬†

Jake began the process of recovering his wife and daughter from the planet. As the ship traveled through the sky on its descent, Jake saw that the world he had left behind was nothing like the one he was returning to. Even from the sky, it was clear that order and contentment had been replaced with frustration and panicked chaos. As Jake flew overhead, he witnessed people bleeding out in the streets. The men had forsaken common politeness for women and children in society. He watched a group of plain-clothed individuals ripping a bag of what he assumed were canned goods from the arms of a mother as she stood in front of her young son. The only things that seemed to matter to people were themselves.

Jake wondered if people even cared for their closest family members anymore or only when it was convenient for them.

The once vibrant, orderly, and shiny cities were a sharp contrast to what he was seeing. Their former glory of only a few months prior was nowhere to be seen now. While some buildings were unaffected, others had been brought to the ground by fire. Jake would soon find out that these fires were a result of the almost nightly riots and the wrecking balls that had been commandeered to search for resources.

Jake‚Äôs Meso ship silently approached his home high above the burning city. It was just before dawn when he brought the ship up against the large window in his living room. Mara and the girls were no doubt in the back of the apartment, just waking up. He thought she might be planning what kind of coffee would help her start the day but, little did he know, resources like coffee had become a luxury. Dawn lay in her mother‚Äôs bed, half awake and thinking of the day her father would return. With nothing but the reinforced steel door in the lobby ‚Äî as well as the security courtesy of Jake‚Äôs platoon ‚Äî protecting them from potential rioters, the girls had become anxious about sleeping alone. While Mara had often walked them back to their rooms in the middle of the night if either of them had had a nightmare, she had allowed them to sleep in her bed since Jake‚Äôs disappearance.

An opening appeared in the side of the Meso ship and Jake emerged. He rapped on the window and called out his wife‚Äôs name. It took several attempts until she bounded the corner into the living room and gawped at Jake.

‚ÄúJake?‚Äù she said under her breath.

Mara stared at her husband, who was completely covered in a golden-brown suit from head to toe. Jake held out his right hand and the plate-glass window melted away. Jake walked from the ship and into his living room as his head emerged from the Meso skin.¬† Mara jumped into Jake‚Äôs arms and embraced him, kissing his cheeks repeatedly as tears welled up in her eyes.

As Jake walked in, Grant stood in the street and looked skyward toward the Meso ship. He tapped his companion on the shoulder and pointed to the ship. From this angle, they could see an oval-shaped hole in the window in front of the ship.

‚ÄúHead back to base,‚Äù Grant instructed the man, named Kevin, referring to his cabin. ‚ÄúGet the rest of the gang and whatever weapons you all can carry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù she asked, pulling away angrily. ‚ÄúHow could you leave us? They are killing women and children out there! A plane fell out the sky. We‚Äôve had to ration food. The girls are traumatized. How could you just disappear and walk back in here?‚Äù

‚ÄúMara,‚Äù Jake spoke calmly.

‚ÄúAnd did you just climb out of a spaceship? And what are you wearing?‚Äù Mara rambled, her voice blubbering like a child.

‚ÄúI will explain everything. I need you to compose yourself,‚Äù Jake continued speaking calmly.

Mara nodded and hugged her husband again.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get the girls,‚Äù he said, leading Mara down the hallway.

As they reached the girls‚Äô bedroom, Mara said, ‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then, she led him to their bedroom.

‚ÄúNightmares?‚Äù he asked as he looked at his girls all snuggled up in his bed.

‚ÄúNightmares, daymares, and everything in between,‚Äù Mara replied.

Jake‚Äôs heart sank, but he was relieved to see them all alive. Now, he had the opportunity to get them out of there. As they gently woke their girls, they began screaming in excitement. It took several moments to calm them and, when they eventually did, it was off to the kitchen. Jake insisted that they would need to eat before they could leave. The journey would be long. While Dawn and June would follow their father anywhere and looked at every trip with him as another adventure, Mara was very reluctant to leave everything she knew behind.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing left here, love,‚Äù Jake said.

But Mara couldn‚Äôt wrap her head around traveling to a totally new world. She was no fool. She could see the death and destruction out her windows and all around her and yet the thought of leaving saddened her. Jake had become frustrated with his wife. He had always tried to shield her from his work life to protect her from the evils that be. But he had begun to feel disappointment toward his wife for the first time since they had met. Part of Jake wanted to leave her behind but he knew that Mara was a good person and that she was likely just scared. He realized that she had probably experienced a great deal of trauma on her own for the last eight weeks.

Meanwhile, Grant and his crew had overpowered the sentry at the lobby door and gained entry into Jake‚Äôs building. Jake didn‚Äôt know it yet, but his presence had inadvertently attracted these rebels. The elevators haven‚Äôt worked in well over a week and they were forced to climb the stairs to the 33^(rd) floor.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to go,‚Äù Jake said almost instinctively as he took Dawn‚Äôs hand and then June‚Äôs before he headed toward the Meso ship. If nothing else, he was going to get his daughters on board. If he had to head back and carry his wife out kicking and screaming, that is what he would do. Jake lifted each of his daughters over the small gap between the window and the ship. He placed them inside and, as soon as their feet and left hands touched the walls of the ship, it began to envelop them in skins. Dawn thought it was cool at first. That was until the skin came up to her face. Then she began to panic.

‚ÄúBe still, Dawn,‚Äù June scolded.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù Dawn whimpered.

But it was too late for tears. The process was so quick that before Dawn‚Äôs panic could set in, she was totally engulfed. She was able to see and breathe effortlessly even though she was totally covered by the life-support skin of the ship. Mara darted in and out of each room adding items to the armful she was walking around with and Jake breathed a sigh of relief to see that his wife had seen reasons and was rearing to leave. Family pictures, Grandma‚Äôs recipe book, and a couple of her favorite collectibles were a few of the items that Mara grabbed as she bobbed around the apartment. She exited each room with a pause and a swivel of her head to see if there was anything important she had forgotten.

Exhausted from the climb up 33 flights of stairs, Grant‚Äôs men exited from the stairwells and proceeded to search the floor for the apartment. They knew what floor it was, but they would need to break down each door on the east end to figure out which one it was. And that‚Äôs what they did. Jake could hear the screams of desperate motivation as Grant ordered his people to find the unit with the ship.

‚ÄúTwo doors left!‚Äù Grant shouted.

Mara walked toward Jake ‚Äî her arms filled with the remnants of her old life. She began taking the final step toward the ship when, without warning, Jake grabbed her by the arms and pulled her in at lightning speed, causing some of the precious belongings to fall all 33 stories to the ground below them. Jake barked at Mara to get into the ship. She was completely taken aback and confused. But just as her anger bubbled up, she heard the door get kicked in behind her. Jake shoved her past him and turned to block the men‚Äôs line of sight to his family.

Grant barreled toward them, staring at the golden brown figure that was Jake and the black shadowy blur of the ship behind him. Grant raised his weapon and fired several times at Jake as he turned to enter the ship. He stumbled forward as several rounds struck him in the back. But the opening in the ship closed. The shadowy blur became complete and the ship silently rose into the sky.

Three years ago, I was staring at a 14% A1C thinking, ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be it.‚Äù Fast forward to today‚ÄîI‚Äôm down to 6%, aiming even lower. It‚Äôs been a journey, and let‚Äôs be real: managing Type 2 diabetes feels like a full-time job.

Tracking glucose levels, planning meals, remembering meds - it‚Äôs overwhelming. I got tired of juggling a million things and thought, *there has to be a better way*.

So, I decided to build it.

**Introducing GlucoBuddy**

I‚Äôm creating an app to make diabetes management less of a hassle:

‚Ä¢ **Effortless Glucose Tracking:** Syncs with your CGM or lets you log manually without the fuss.

‚Ä¢ **Personalized Low-Carb Meal Suggestions:** Because eating healthy shouldn‚Äôt be boring.

‚Ä¢ **Activity & Sleep Monitoring:** Keep tabs on what affects your levels.

‚Ä¢ **Medication Reminders:** Never miss a dose again.

‚Ä¢ **Community Support:** Connect with folks who get it.

I‚Äôm building GlucoBuddy from my tiny apartment, fueled by coffee and a desire to make life easier for all of us dealing with this.

**Why am I sharing this?**

Because I believe in the power of community. Your feedback can shape GlucoBuddy into something truly helpful. It‚Äôs not about selling - it‚Äôs about solving a problem we all share.

**Want to be part of it?**

Early access is coming soon. If you‚Äôre interested, drop your email at [glucobuddy.health](https://glucobuddy.health/). No spam - just updates and maybe a few bad jokes.

1fwx413,https://i.redd.it/l5p8810efzsd1.jpeg,Zino Platinum Crown Double Grande Turbo (7.5 x 50). Worth every penny!,"This was gifted to me by a close friend about six months ago, so it has had plenty of resting time.

I've been a big fan of the Scepter series for a while, but this Crown is a completely different animal. While the Scepter has spice and some rough edges at times, the Crown is velvety smooth. And where the Scepter is consistent and balanced, I find myself constantly surprised with the frequent transitions in the Crown. Nuts, flowers, cedar, baking spices, sweet cream, light coffee, molasses, honey, salt, herbs, earthiness, leather, all in a shifting palate. 

Construction is what you'd expect out of a Davidoff. The cigar is tightly packed with a smooth wrapper with some visible veins and no seams. The draw is slightly snug and needed a bit of coaxing before lighting, but not plugged. The burn has been dead straight. Strength is medium-minus at best, though there's a definite nic hit in the first half that wanes by the second half (or maybe I got used to it). 

Despite its length, it smokes a lot faster than I expected. I'm 70 minutes into the smoke, and am just hitting the last third. I anticipated this to be about a 90 minute smoke. But by the final third, everything slows down! Another transaction occurs as a little white pepper and a mineral note show up in the background. The flavors I mentioned previously are all there, just intensified. Smoke production became copious and coated my mouth with a pleasing creaminess. With the tar buildup slowing the burn rate, I'm now almost two hours into the smoke with 2"" still to go!

As far as pairing is concerned, this would pair well with a nicely aged cognac or other lower ABV spirit. I wouldn't pair it with anything cask strength as the liquor might overpower the cigar. But it also pairs well with a sweet non-alcoholic liquid. Since I'm smoking this in the morning, I had it with my morning tea. It was an excellent pairing.

So, is this worth $50? In a word, yes. Though I mentioned common flavors, there's a certain indescribable quality about the smoke that I don't get from other cigars. And with the constant transitions, the cigar is full of surprises! That said, like other ultra-premium cigars, this cigar is all about subtlety and nuance. It's not bold in the slightest. This isn't something I'd smoke following a much bolder cigar. You need a clean palate to appreciate what it has on offer.

Based on this experience, I will look for sales and get a couple more. They occasionally go for $35 apiece. Still expensive, but worth having a couple or a few on hand.",6,1728153423.0,cigar_refuge,1,1.0,False

I found myself by chance with a

* Gaggia Macina/A
* Gaggia MDF
* Eureka Mignon
* Eureka Silenzio

at home, and I need to decide which one to keep for espresso. Suggestions?

=Long Story=

A couple of years ago, I bought a used Gaggia Espresso machine to make espresso at home. I didn't know then that I couldn't use just any grinder, but I needed one specific for espresso.

I started my research, but I couldn't invest any more money, so I put the machine in the basement.

Last week, I decided to look for a used grinder. Browsing classifieds, I found a Gaggia Macina/A. This grinder has the same style as the Gaggia Espresso, so I thought, ""Why not? They would look cool together"" and bought it. But it's not particularly good, and it makes a mess.

Two days later, I saw another person selling two Eurekas marked as ""not working"" for 50‚Ç¨. I thought I could have a look at them and at least understand the inside of a grinder without risking ruining them.

Turns out that this person has a bar here in Italy, and he used the Eurekas for decaffeinated coffee, but they suddenly stopped working and he didn't have interest in fixing them (coffee suppliers often provide new machines free of charge to bars).

I bought them, and he asked, ""Why are you buying these machines?"" I told him I wanted to have a look inside, and he said, ""Then I have this one I don't use anymore as well. Do you want it?"" (the Gaggia MDF).

So this morning, I started disassembling all the grinders, and long story short, all of them work!

They were gross inside, with years of ground coffee stuck in the burrs (I couldn't turn them by hand, it was like cement).

Now, I went from having zero grinders to four, and keeping them all doesn't make sense (my wife already threatened me to keep just one in the kitchen üòÖ)

What would be the best one to keep for espresso? What should I take into consideration? Should I throw them all?

Any suggestion would be more than welcome!

1fwx2ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1fwx2ti/severe_suicidal_thoughts_day_two/,Severe suicidal thoughts - Day two.,"Good afternoon everyone.

Before I begin, I am fine. I am in control and I know these feelings are artificial. I don't own a gun or anything and I'm going to sleep these vile feelings away as soon as I click post. I also called my Doctor and they confirmed I should stop taking the medication and get some rest. 

I started Qelbree at 100mg as of two days ago. After my first day I noticed I didn't procrastinate hardly anything. If I thought about something I did it. I still more or less had to force myself to do things, but it was immensely easier to stay on task but I did notice my heart rate was a little crazy so I stopped drinking coffee to help compensate. 

Fast forward to today and I was busy cleaning up a resume when I got a bit dizzy and my heart started acting up again. I ignored it. I then noticed I was feeling strangely overwhelmed by the most mundane things like bills I might have forgotten or if I have enough laundry soap in my closet then in the space of a few hours I found myself pacing frantically in my living room with the most sheer panic I've felt in...well, maybe ever. 

The urge to do something drastic to fix this...nebulous..vague feeling of panic is intense. Funny thing I've also stopped blinking for the most part. Talk about whacky. I know I sound calm and such but this has been a rough afternoon. Thankfully the whole thing has left me exhausted so I'm going to sleep through all this nonsense until this stuff is out of my system. 

The only reason I chose to post this is in case someone has a severe reaction like mine and needs reassurance. I have experience with mental medication making me feel bizarrely but maybe this is someone's first time and they cannot tell the difference between their thoughts and the chemical. 

Even knowing it comes from my medication it is still difficult to parse the difference, I'll be honest. But I'm sleepy as hell so I'm going to have a nap and drink some water.  ",1,1728153328.0,qelbree,0,1.0,False

First update: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothetical_AITA/comments/1fopf2z/update_haita_for_abusing_my_dog/

Okay it's been a hecktic few days. My gf relllied to my text asking to meet up. I agreed because I thought we could finally reconcile. We agreed to meet at a coffee shop in my area. I got there at 1pm yesterday afternoon, the time we said we'd meet. She didn't show up, and at 1:15 I was ready to just head home. That was when she came in with FOURfriends walking in behind her. None of them were our mutual friends besides gabby who came in last. I asked her why they were there, as I thought we would have a private conversation. She said she needed them for ""support"". Maybe I should have left right then, but I was still holding out hope we could get past this. I asked her if she wanted to talk first and she nodded. She started talking about how when she saw me shove the dog off my chair and yell at her, she felt like she saw me in a whole new light. She felt like I was hiding this abuser side of myself to ""lure her in until marriage."" (Her words)  I know her Last boyfriend boyfriend abused her (physically--hitting, pushing, punching) And she said he seemed like a nice guy at first too. I started to feel really simpathetic and guilty. I knew her ex was abusive but I didn't really think about it being related to this. Of course it could have been triggering to see me yell and shove my dog. 

I told her that I understood where she was coming from, but if we are in a relationship she needs to trust me. Her face went from kind and soft to rage in seconds. She stood up and screamed at me ""how can I trust someone who abuses his own dog and doesn't even feel bad about it?""  I was taken aback and started apologizing. She started to calm down, and asked if I would ever do that to my dog again. I said yes, if my dog jumped on me repeatedly, I would discipline her. My girlfriend started screaming at me again. She said I was abusing my dog and everyone here can see it. I was angry at this point and yelled back that no one was in her side, they were just pretending to be because she's crazy and would probably hate them if they didn't go along with her. She seemed shocked, and said that wasn't true. I asked gabby point blank in front of her. She said no, she didn't agree with my gf. I asked each of them and they all sheepishly said they agreed with me. Even Tracy didn't say she agreed with my gf, but that she was ""undecided"". Everyone left pretty soon after that, including me. 

Gabby texted me the next day, and told me that since our meeting at the cafe, all of my gfs friends have kind of abandoned her. When she tried to yell at them for disagreeing with her, I guess they had just hat enough and snapped back that she was delusional. My girlfriend texted me yesterday asking to get back together and saying that everyone abandoned her and I was all she had left. I told her I was pissed about everything that happened, and she said I was right and she wouldn't make a big deal of it again. She said it just brought back a bunch of awful memories of her ex. I said I understood, but I wasn't sure if I could get back together with her. She told be to take all the time I need. I really need your advice--should I look past this at get back with her??

1fwx03a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1fwx03a/creatine_performance_mushrooms/,Creatine & performance mushrooms,"The following is my experience with 2 products that have recently made a huge positive impact on my daily life both at home and at work. I don‚Äôt know all the science behind why, and hopefully some of you can enlighten me.

I‚Äôve always struggled with some form of ADHD whenever I had to sit still in school or at a desk job. Never diagnosed, because if I‚Äôm not sitting behind a desk I‚Äôm perfectly fine. I can go on and on with the frustrations it has caused me in my professional career since I have a stressful corporate desk job, but I‚Äôm sure many of you already know what it‚Äôs like. 

I‚Äôm not on any sort of medications at all and currently take the following vitamins daily: Pure Encapsulations ONE multivitamin, Thorne D-5000 and Thorne Vitamin C.

Ever since the pandemic, I‚Äôve worked from home 3 days a week. For the last 2 years, I‚Äôve been grumpy and short tempered and I don‚Äôt know why. It‚Äôs out of character for me because I‚Äôve always been ‚Äúfun parent‚Äù, always laughing and in a good mood. I‚Äôve been snapping at my kids if they were making too much noise, whining or arguing with each other. In the past I‚Äôd let them work out their frustrations and/or talk it out with them but that somehow changed and I could feel my blood boiling at the slightest inconvenience/disturbance while working. My wife would mention that I seem like I‚Äôm always frustrated and in a bad mood and that‚Äôs not like me. I didn‚Äôt know why or what changed. I still don‚Äôt.

About 6 months ago I started taking Laird Hamilton‚Äôs Performance Mushroom product after hearing about it in the Shawn Ryan podcast. (I also switch back and forth between that and his mushroom coffee creamer because I like the taste.) It‚Äôs a mix of Lions Mane, Chaga, Cordyceps and Maitake. Prior to this, I‚Äôve tried numerous over the counter products like Alpha Brain and didn‚Äôt notice anything at all, so I didn‚Äôt have high expectations. As soon as I started the performance mushrooms I immediately felt a change on day 1. My mind was calmer and I didn‚Äôt feel like I had 500 browser tabs open in my brain. My libido took a big hit, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing for me. A cool breeze could put me in the mood and my wife would joke that I must have strong caveman DNA because I‚Äôd be ready to go if she even smiled in my direction. The mushroom has slowed that down drastically. Everything works fine so I‚Äôm not complaining. Mentally, I‚Äôd describe it as having a really rough idling motor that‚Äôs got misfires and then adding the mushrooms really quieted it down and had it running smoothly. That‚Äôs the difference it made for me mentally.

A month ago I started taking creatine (adding it to my coffee with the performance mushrooms) and I feel like I‚Äôm back to my old self. I knew it helped with cognitive function which is why I wanted to take it. I don‚Äôt know what exactly it did, or does, but my wife and kids also brought up how I‚Äôm not grumpy anymore and seem like my old self again. Also, I‚Äôm able to focus on my work without constant distractions and can multi-task/switch gears and go right back to what I was originally working on where before this I‚Äôd go off the rails like a squirrel at the slightest distraction and could never find my way back to what I first started doing. 

Summary: somehow creatine fixed my recent short temper and grouchiness as well as my ability to focus on work. Performance mushrooms also helped a lot. I feel like my old self in terms of my mood and happiness. I don‚Äôt remember ever being able to focus and complete work tasks like I have now.

How to overcome my anxiety?,"I want to start off by saying I am diagnosed with General Anxiety and Panic Disorder.

A little context: Two years ago, I quit my job as an Ice Cream Server because my coworker was giving me anxiety and panic attacks due to the way she was treating me. The bosses were great, the customers were good, and my favorite coworker was also quitting. It took a lot for me to quit the job because when I was about to quit my husband (35/M) decided to tell me he might need help financially one day and I was riddled with guilt because he has been the one financially supporting us both for years. I decided to try my hand at full time streaming video games on Twitch because he has been doing so for a living and we were able to compromise that as long as I work hard streaming he‚Äôd be okay with this being my job.

Fast forward to now, his gaming organization decided to let him go so he‚Äôs making significantly less money to able to continue financially supporting us both. He said the best case scenario is if I find a better job with a stable income so I can help contribute. 

I originally wanted to try being a barista but I‚Äôve applied to 10+ local Starbucks and other coffee shops but I haven‚Äôt heard back. The only one that responded was Target as a fulfillment expert. Tomorrow‚Äôs my orientation.

How do you guys handle getting into the working world long term on a day to day basis? What happens if you get panic attacks and anxiety at work, how do you compose yourself or handle the matter? 

I really don‚Äôt want to screw this up because my husband needs my help and I worry what if I end up wanting to quit every job I get because of anxiety or panic attacks. To be fair though.. my last job was the first time it has given me panic attacks like that so realistically it may not even happen. 

I‚Äôve been coddled by my parents and had the luxury of living rent-free basically my entire life so now I‚Äôm dealing with the consequences of finally needing to face the real-world. 

Please be mindful. Try not to give me harsh judgements because I‚Äôm sure whatever you‚Äôre thinking I‚Äôve probably already said to myself a lot of times. I only want genuine advices on how to overcome this chapter of my life that I should‚Äôve overcome and conquered years ago.

I've been drinking ""good"" coffee (aka coffee I like) for a long time now and I love it, coffee is my favorite drink. I've got a V60, an Encore, scale, kettle, etc, and it does pretty much everything I need it to do.

Though in spite of that I still struggle to deal with the caffeine content. If I drink tea, even black tea, I don't quite have these issues but with coffee I do. If I have 8oz I'll generally feel okay for an hour or so and then I immediately get sleepy - if I have anything more than that (and I typically do) my brain gets all fogged up, I hyperfixate and my anxiety goes through the ROOF. Like I'll strugle to function socially when I've had a full cup of coffee, constantly on edge, etc, it's stupid. And then like an hour or so later I'm getting headaches and feeling exhausted, I don't get it. All of that just from about 12oz of coffee.

And it's strange because I do have a tolerance to caffeine: I've been drinking 2-3 cups a day for quite awhile now, multiple years at this point. And it really sucks too because I would love to drink more coffee, it just turns me into a mess.

So is I dunno, does it sound like there's something I'm missing here? Am I overestimating how much the average coffee enthusiast drinks a day?  I would be curious to hear your guys' thoughts. I've never really had ""good"" decaf so maybe that's an option but.. it never seemed to taste the same.

Here's the writing:
PROLOGUE

I am hopelessly lost in a dreamscape, my own little halcyon realm, where the mockingbird and I finally come to armistice. Softly I hear the pitter-patter of fae-feet like an echo, and my dream distorts. Wraiths disperse, voices still, and all lively things wither.
Not this early‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt wake me now.

More pitter-patter, and he struggles his way up the shelf. All is quiet, and like clockwork I am promptly roused from my rest as a book falls off its shelf with a loud thud. Shall I open my sleep-heavy eyelids to meet a sheepish gaze? Instead, I just sigh.

‚ÄòSorry‚Ä¶‚Äô comes the apology, whispered as the culprit hurries away with his find. Ever raucously dragging the hardcover along. Another sigh from me, and a rather bereft one at that, for my book.

Languorously I move my weary carcass to the side of my bed, letting my feet touch the floor scantily. Running a hand through my tousled hair I squint my eyes, how is any living being capable of finding mornings enjoyable? While I ponder and process the existence of daylight, I feel my way to the kitchen with short, listless steps and half-opened eyes.

‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶ who woke you from hibernation?‚Äù 

I muster up a glare to my cohort and source of sarcastic banter. ‚ÄúTake one good guess. No, daybreak be not the answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm, let me think a little... was it perhaps a pesky little thief, such as the one passed here shortly with a book of your collection?‚Äù Kai laughed, looking in the direction of said thief, ‚ÄúPerhaps the Scoundrel that be Feran?‚Äù

One dismayed look from me confirmed his guess, and I seek out the kettle for coffee.

‚ÄúBe the clock ticking, or has it come to standstill?‚Äù He enquires absentmindedly, little bothered with my woes.

‚ÄúSharp as a marble, aren‚Äôt you? Thinking I would possess this knowledge or a guess thereof.‚Äù I reply, stirring the mixture of black bitterness. ‚ÄúIts time doesn‚Äôt change the fact of discarding it.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill‚Ä¶ try to hurry. If only you didn‚Äôt avoid the daylight as if it‚Äôs the plague‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh dear, angry little early bird now, are we?‚Äù I raise an eyebrow and glance at him. ‚ÄúOr just morbid curiosity, I wonder.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither.‚Äù He replies, walking away to the door.

Why the haste‚Ä¶ cadavers can‚Äôt run away. I think to myself, taking a big swig of the burning brew before sauntering to the door. ‚ÄúLet us be gone, before more of your gibberish meets my ear.‚Äù I motion to the door.

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù Feran inquires, running to the door. ‚ÄúCan I come with?‚Äù

Kai glares at him, crossing his arms. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt going anywhere of interest to you. And you know you can‚Äôt come with.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Feran sulks, pouting. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have a book to read?‚Äù I glance at him contemptuously, opening the door and stepping outside.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ but I want to go with.‚Äù Feran retorted.

‚ÄúSad, you‚Äôll have to stay behind this time.‚Äù Kai shooed him back as he closed the door. Feran mumbled angrily to himself, rambling as he trudged off to his book.

‚ÄúLovely one to deal with.‚Äù Kai muttered to himself, walking at a swift pace to catch up since I‚Äôve already started walking along the path. Nothing quite likes the smell of rain as the sun shone idly here and there, though still a bit bright to me.
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs turn is it this time? Surely you are the chosen.‚Äù Comes an interruption to my thoughts.

‚ÄúWho, me? Couldn‚Äôt be.‚Äù I keep my eyes on the ground as I walk, observing the florae. ‚ÄúSurely, you speak absolute malarkey.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, fellow speaker of nonsensical words, I speak great truths.‚Äù He intones, blithely following my steps.

‚ÄúThen the task be mine, if that would so appease you.‚Äù We walk further in silence, enjoying the rare sunlight as it radiates its glimmers through the trees. Vivid colours these, too bright actually. Yet still scenic. When we draw near, Kai finds himself a place to bask in the rays, while I am off to do more grim things.

‚ÄúTry not to take your merry time.‚Äù I hear him faintly as I pick my way down precarious footholds. As if I have any intention of listening.
I am soon lost in the duskiness of ferns, moss, and other such foliage which flourishes in wan light. Oh, the earthy ambience‚Ä¶ and coppery blood.
Here, in the ghoulish caverns so slightly buried in earth, I nimbly approach a cold figure. Broken cadaver, I think to myself as I observe its lifeless form. Soon to be nothing more than mere dirt under the feet of the living.

He is the oldest of four children and his mother raised him by herself as a teen mother at 19. His three younger siblings are from his stepdad who his mother was married to since he was around 6 years old though in the past two years their relationship had fallen apart and are now getting divorced, the stepdad is kind of a scumbag and since they are not legally married, he is only giving her the bare minimum for their kids (to my knowledge). Since the divorce and the leading up to it my boyfriend feels it is his job to take care of his mother and siblings which I understand but at the same time he works barely partime getting only a few shifts a month if even and is a struggling university student in one of the most expensive cities in the world and is biting off way more than he can chew. Just a few examples of this:
Before his mother and stepdad divorced he came into a bit of money, around 600 or so which he used all of to buy gold for his mother (upon her request) and was left with nothing for himself. At the same time I also had come into a bit of money though significantly less than what he had which I ended up having to spend on all our dates, days out, food, drink for the both of us as well as sending him money for himself everytime he went out with his friends so l essentially blew through the small chunk of money I got, as well as my savings and income from my at the time job because he couldn't afford atleast a cup of coffee because his mother wanted gold. This left me starting university with no job and nothing in my pockets because I was providing for myself, my groceries, clothes going out etc as well as his (im also only
18) yet when his mother needs something none of that matters. I was always fond of his mother but this incident never sat right with me especially when 600 isnt even a crazy amount of money for a teenager its literal chump change and she knew he had no income at the time yet still demanded on him spending it on her, ontop of that she promised his grandmother gold on his behalf without him knowing or having the money to get it for her, which I also found incredibly inconsiderate. Since the divorce he has gotten a job and it has only gotten worse.
He pays gas and electricity which i think is reasonable, but on top of that he's paying for her phone bill as well as giving her 400 pocket money and leaving himself with essentially nothing and also buying groceries for the house and ordering takeout. Now hes talking about getting a different job with regular shifts and moving his mum and siblings out of the country, paying 1.7 k a month for their rent and living expenses in whatever country, as well as getting himself a student house and paying for groceries, rent, bills as well as entertainment or going out which i think is delusional for him to even think he'd make that much in a month at 18 but even if he did I feel as if he's doing more than he needs too and is acting like her husband instead of her son. From my perspective its disgraceful that shes even allowing him and expecting him to do this much knowing he barely gets any shifts, its her role as a mother to be providing for him and taking his needs into account not expecting him to sort it all out for her. I told him this aswell as to be realistic and stop acting like her husband and playing house with her which pissed him off and he ended the conversation clearly not willing to see it any other way.

China is gambling their next 8-10 years of development on this bull run (though we expect US to interfere and try to fk it up).

When US was increasing interest (not for bullshit dual mandate, but for liquidity drain, sucking money from world to bankrupt countries so US can cheaply acquire their key assets, this played out many times in history), China couldn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt inject any liquidity into their markets (the money would simply ‚Äúrun away‚Äù to US and buy bonds or invest in USD related things).

Now with Feds just beginning to decrease rates (because while it bankrupts other countries, it hurts US internally as well), it‚Äôs China‚Äôs only chance this decade to heat up a market and regain trust of their own people (who spend nothing, don‚Äôt push economic growth, but have 300 trillion rmb or 42 trillion USD in savings), as well as regain trust of foreign funds (based on Hong Kong stock market, it‚Äôs working), so the heated stock market‚Äôs capital can then distribute across other sectors of China for stimulation of BOTH business development and consumer spending (of those 42 trillion USD in savings), resulting in a kick start, and in the beginning of another 8-10 year development cycle.

(China also just fired the ONLY successfully tested intercontinental ballistic missile, that CANNOT be intercepted (too fast, all interception missiles will simply chase it forever), and capable of carrying nukes, and can accurately hit anything on EARTH in 20 minutes, a week ago, to show the world China is not to be fucked with, and your capital is safe here.) 

After China stocks are up, capital will be shifted toward real estate for stabilizing and finally soft landing (so China doesn‚Äôt become another Japan), then shift towards technology to race with US, then industrial, then consumer, etc. for a total national industrial upgrade, all for the preparation of anchoring RMB as global currency.

And something about Chinese bull markets, it‚Äôs not a stable U.S. bull, it‚Äôs fast up, fast down, but up ALOT, and down ALOT. With this bull being the only bull after ~75% of Chinese population (750m people) uses Douyin(TikTok), the social media news spread paired with this 1 week holiday time for catching up with news, preparing funds, and opening stock accounts,
will send the stock market to the fking moon in a week.

Spoke to my friend who works in China Securities (biggest security company in China), she said the sales department (account opening department) of Chinese security companies in the observable history has never worked overtime, but is now open 24/7 to open accounts, we are expecting more than 20 million new stock accounts by Tuesday of China (10/7/2024 Monday of USA), and they are all LOADED.

(Chinese ETFs on US exchange: (e.g. ASHR, KSTR, CQQQ, KWEB, MCHI, CXSE, etc. etc‚Ä¶)) these all track Chinese stock groups or indexes, they are all going to the fking moon.

Chinese people are insane when it comes to quick profit, they‚Äôre taking out loans against their homes and cars as of NOW, and 10x leveraging into the stock market. The only problem right now, is stock market in China pauses for the day after reaching 10%, 20% or 30% increase (depending on which sector) in a day, meaning, they won‚Äôt even have the chance to enter the market, if that 10% jump up is instant.

Which neighborhoods should be on our TO shortlist (assuming we could afford them)?

Ideal neighborhood: 
- Walkable to amenities (e.g. groceries, gym, pharmacy, restaurants, coffee shops, and maybe some music venues or theaters)
- Sensible commute by car (30ish minutes each way to Scarborough area is fine, 1+ hour each way is too much)

- Accessible to arts and culture (we enjoy live music, comedy, talks/lectures, etc.)

As I cycle through the winding lanes of Essex on crisp Sunday mornings, the dewy air filling my lungs, I often find myself contemplating what it would be like to share these simple yet profound moments with someone special.

I'm a 36-year-old engineer by trade, though that barely scratches the surface of who I am. My colleagues know me as the one who always has a witty quip ready, usually delivered with a raised eyebrow and my best attempt at a Hugh Grant-esque charm (though I'd like to think I'm slightly less bumbling).

When I'm not designing solutions to complex problems at work, you'll likely find me in one of two places: either on my beloved carbon fiber road bike, chasing the horizon through the Essex countryside, or nestled in my cozy home office, embarking on epic gaming adventures. There's something magical about losing yourself in a beautifully crafted video game - it's like interactive storytelling at its finest.

I'm passionate about the little things in life: the perfect cup of Earl Grey, the satisfying click of a mechanical keyboard, the way the sunlight filters through morning fog on an early ride. I'd love to find someone who appreciates these small wonders, who understands that romance isn't just grand gestures, but also quiet moments of shared understanding.

I'm looking for someone who can match my enthusiasm for life, who isn't afraid to be a bit silly, and who might want to join me for both virtual adventures and real-world explorations. Maybe we could start with a coffee and end up planning our next cycling route together? Or perhaps you'd like to teach me about your own passions - I'm always eager to learn and share experiences.

They say engineers aren't typically romantic, but I'd like to think I break that stereotype. After all, isn't love itself a kind of engineering - a perfect balance of chemistry, timing, and careful design?

About you: I'm open to connecting with someone who brings their own unique perspective to life. Age isn't as important as authenticity and a genuine desire to build something meaningful together. Bonus points if you can appreciate both a good book and a good game, or if you're willing to learn why I find both so captivating.

We got a ton of bulk items too big for bagging and 15 giant contractors trash bags full of litter off the Trail.  Among the hundreds of pounds of trash we picked, we found a whole  wheelchair, a PS4 with remote, multiple syringes, and even a buttplug. You name it we picked it up off the trail. Today was a major success, and I'm already VERY excited to see you all at the next one!

I'm a photographer, albeit not by profession, and recently relocated to Luxembourg. I'm looking for people who'd like to model for portraits. No prior experience is needed.

The only requirement is being of age. In exchange for your time, you'll get all the pictures we decide to keep. I'm happy to answer any questions or to meet over a coffee, to get all the details right and ensure it's fun and productive for everyone.

If interested, please DM!",1,1728152137.0,Luxembourg,1,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt understand why, the drop-off went fine, I handed the coffees to the lady and she seemed nice, she was smiling the whole time.

I can‚Äôt help but think they just ripped me off., this sucks.
