1oymkrr,https://www.wbtv.com/2025/11/15/federal-officials-confirm-officers-have-begun-charlotte-immigration-enforcement/,Federal officials confirm officers have begun Charlotte immigration enforcement,"Federal officials confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city had begun as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

- “Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”

- Local officials, including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles criticized such actions, saying in a statement they “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

- “We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,” said the statement, also signed by County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed

- The federal government hadn’t previously announced the push. But Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said earlier this week that two federal officials had told him that Customs agents would be arriving soon. Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

- Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino — a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte — said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulling people over since Friday.

- “Basically what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said. “I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and Border Patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.”

- Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work when he saw Border Patrol agents chasing people.

- “I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,” he said.

- Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground.

- “I told them, ’I’m an American citizen,” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn’t believe I was an American citizen.”

- After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said he was finally allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship. Aceituno said he had to walk back some distance to his car. He later filed a police report over the broken glass.

- In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton’s front yard on Saturday morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One agent tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They didn’t respond, and the agents left in a gray minivan without making arrests.

- “This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we’ve got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They’ve broken no laws, and that’s what concerns me,” Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone, told The Associated Press.

- “It’s an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,” the 73-year-old said.

- Amid reports that Charlotte could be the next city facing an immigration crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed, but the contractor decided to go ahead.

- “Half an hour later he’s in our yard, he’s working and Border Patrol rolls up,” she said. “They’re here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there’s just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.”

- Local organizations sought to prepare for the push, trying to inform immigrants of their rights and considering peaceful protests. JD Mazuera Arias, who won election to the Charlotte City Council in September, was one of about a dozen people standing watch Saturday outside a Latin American bakery in his district in east Charlotte.

- A nearby bakery was closed amid word of the possible immigration crackdown, he said. The government action was hurting both people’s livelihoods and the city’s economy, he said.

- “This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?” he asked. “This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants, but for U.S. citizens.”

- President Donald Trump’s administration has defended federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

- But Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said Friday that the vast majority of those detained in these operations have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.

- He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” they see and notify local law enforcement about it.

- The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department had emphasized ahead of time that it isn’t involved in federal immigration enforcement.",2,1763301953.0,Defeat_Project_2025,1,1.0,False

1oymh0c,https://i.redd.it/8j4dajh7lm1g1.jpeg,The Ultimate Nutella Tiramisu,"

This recipe swaps out the traditional cocoa powder for a generous layer of Nutella, adding a deep hazelnut and chocolate flavor that pairs perfectly with the coffee and mascarpone.

Yield: Serves 9-12
Prep Time:30 minutes
Chill Time:6 hours (or preferably overnight)

---

Ingredients

For the Coffee Soak:

· 1 ½ cups (355 ml) strong brewed coffee or espresso, cooled to room temperature
· 2 tablespoons coffee liqueur (like Kahlúa) or dark rum (optional)
· 1 tablespoon granulated sugar

For the Mascarpone Filling:

· 3 large egg yolks
· ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
· 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
· 16 oz (450g) mascarpone cheese, softened at room temperature
· 1 cup (240ml) heavy cream, cold
· 1 jar (13 oz / 370g) Nutella

For Assembly:

· 24-28 Ladyfinger cookies (Savoiardi)
· ½ cup (about 50g) toasted, chopped hazelnuts, for garnish (optional)

---

Instructions

1. Prepare the Coffee Soak:
In a shallow bowl wide enough to dip a ladyfinger,combine the cooled coffee, coffee liqueur (if using), and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.

2. Make the Mascarpone Filling:

· In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and ½ cup of sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water (double boiler), making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Whisk constantly for 5-7 minutes until the mixture becomes pale, thick, and hot to the touch. This step pasteurizes the eggs.
· Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Let it cool for 10-15 minutes.
· In a separate large bowl, use a hand mixer or whisk to beat the softened mascarpone until smooth and creamy.
· Gently fold the cooled egg yolk mixture into the mascarpone until just combined and smooth. Be careful not to overmix.
· In another chilled bowl, whip the cold heavy cream until it holds stiff peaks.
· Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture in two additions until no white streaks remain. Your filling should be light and fluffy.

3. Assemble the Tiramisu:

· First Layer: Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for 1-2 seconds per side. You want them moist but not soggy and falling apart. Arrange a single layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x9 inch (or similar 2.5-3 quart) dish.
· Second Layer: Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the ladyfingers.
· Third Layer: Now, for the star of the show! Spoon generous dollops of Nutella (about half the jar) over the mascarpone layer. Use a spoon or offset spatula to gently spread it into an even layer.
· Repeat: Create another layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers, followed by the remaining mascarpone cream.
· Final Touch: Warm the remaining Nutella slightly in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to make it easier to drizzle. Drizzle it artistically over the top layer of mascarpone cream.

4. Chill and Serve:

· Cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, but overnight is highly recommended. This crucial resting time allows the flavors to meld and the ladyfingers to soften perfectly.
· Just before serving, sprinkle with the toasted chopped hazelnuts for a delightful crunch.

---

Chef's Tips & Variations

· Egg-Free Option: Omit the egg yolk and sugar cooking step. Simply whip the heavy cream with the ½ cup of sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the softened mascarpone.
· Alcohol-Free: Simply leave out the coffee liqueur. The dessert will still be fantastic.
· The Ladyfinger Dip: The key to the perfect texture is a quick dip. If you let them sit too long, they will become mushy and make the tiramisu watery.
· Softening Nutella: If your Nutella is very thick, gently warming the entire jar in a bowl of warm water (without getting water in it) will make it much easier to spread.
· Make it a Cake: You can also assemble this in a 9-inch springform pan for a beautiful, sliceable cake presentation.
· Storage: This tiramisu will keep beautifully in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 3 days.

Enjoy your incredibly delicious, crowd-pleasing Nutella Tiramisu

Hi! It’s me, again. Hahaha! Di ko na alam pang  beses ko nang magpost dito. 

But, obviously still haven’t found the one yet. May dadarating paba para sa akin, Lord?!! Hahaha. Eme

So I recently moved to the city, in Makati specifically. And I would like to find someone na kasama kong mag gala on my free days. Just wanna get more familiarized with the area. Let’s visit coffee shops, restaurants, museums, I also have a little background on jogging so we can do that as well. 

Before anything else, here are some things about me:

- 29 F (cancer bb ♋️)
- Single, of course. Been single for 10 years now, wow right?!!! 
- 5’2 84kgs (yes, I’m a plus size gurlie)
- As I mentioned above, just recently moved here in Makati, for work. 
- working 6 days a week, so I am hoping to meet someone who can respect and understand na mahirap ang schedule ko but who is still willing to date(?) me HAHA
- may sense kausap (according sa friends and past men who I dated) matalino daw ako kausap sabi nila HAHA. We’ll see about that
- culinary arts graduate, so yeah di kita gugutumin. Eme! HAHAHA
- naglalaro ML. Pero Miya at Angela lang alam. HAHAHAHAHA
- Into sitcoms. Currently rewatching FRIENDS, and si Monica palang nabibili ko sa Happy Meal ng Mcdo 😩

Enough about me, so here’s some of my preferences:

- 30 to 40 years old (yes, I’m into older men) 
- pero utang na loob yung wala namang sabit. - single. not married. If ever married, yung annulled na sana and on good terms with the ex wife
- working, kasi tbh gusto ko lang din nang may mang spoil sakin HAHAHA
- clingy. But not too much. Just the right balance of malambing and clingy
- 5’6 and above height, yes may preference ako sa height 🥺
- kakampink 🌸 (I am strong with my political views, kaya this is important)

So I guess that’s it? Baka wala na tayong mai-topic kapag nilagay ko lahat rito. HAHAHA

Social situations drain me, meeting new people feels exhausting, and putting myself out there romantically is something I overthink endlessly. I’ve always wanted a connection that feels natural and slow, but dating apps and social expectations seem to run on a completely different energy than mine.

When I try to talk to someone I like, my mind goes blank, and I end up overanalyzing every message or gesture. Small things, like asking someone out for coffee, feel like monumental tasks. And yet, I crave intimacy and understanding, but it seems like everyone else is more confident, more direct, and more willing to chase after people.

Sometimes I wonder if my introversion is a barrier or just a part of who I am. I like deep conversations, quiet moments, and really getting to know someone before anything else. But the world of dating feels fast, loud, and superficial, which makes me feel even more invisible and unsure of myself.

I guess I’m looking for advice, or maybe just someone who understands how complicated dating can feel when your energy is quieter than the world around you. Does anyone else feel like dating is designed for extroverts, and if so, how do you navigate it without losing yourself?",1,1763301557.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

I can’t tell whether she’s interested or if she’s just an outgoing, flirty person in general.

We’ve seen each other six times and talked for maybe 30 minutes in total. Spoke about things outside of the gym, and she shows some interest in my personal life too. We spoke very briefly about our delicate family situations. We also joke a bit with each other and I tease her.

She attends these classes and works at the gym reception too, lets me in for free and told me twice that I can message her before coming so she’ll let me in again. She also often offers me free coffee and snacks from reception.

She also added me to her instagram close friends. I noticed she sometimes re-watches my stories, and once messaged me to ask if I was going to a class later that week, a few hours after our message conversation had ended.

Besides handshake and small shoulder hug at end of sessions (everyone does them as respect), where she seems shy. Touch barrier still exists between us, I tried to break it but wasn’t confident and she left the conversation after, could be cause it was during the water break and we had to go back.

Here’s the confusing part: she’s very flirty with a lot of guys at the gym. She jokes around and touches my friend (who has a girlfriend). She has that naturally extroverted, social vibe that makes it hard to tell where the line is between friendliness and actual interest.

Today, before training, she invited me to go swimming with her and her friend (F) after the session. I didn’t really commit because I wasn’t sure if it was a friendly invite or something more. During the break, she brought it up again — basically inviting me twice.

Did I mess up by not going? And would you say she likes me back or does she see me as her friend and nothing more at this point? Im pretty sure she knows I like her.

So… me and my friends, all final-year MBBS students, were going through constant caffeine crash cycles. The jitters, the anxiety, the uncomfortable dip after coffee or energy drinks. We study all this in FMT, but facing it ourselves hit differently.

We started experimenting with different things that could help. That’s how we discovered matcha. It’s actually great, but honestly… we really couldn’t get used to the taste, and getting clean-label matcha in India isn’t easy.

Currently, we’re researching caffeine and L-theanine along with our institute’s pharma faculty. Maybe, if the writing turns out well, we might even publish a small paper since it’s our first research project. We tried L-theanine with coffee in proper, scientifically established ratios (lots of research already shows their synergy and alpha wave effects, but I won’t go deep here or this post will become too long).
But surprisingly… it worked. A lot.
We made our friends try it too, and they felt the same effects.

Around the same time a mental health survey team came to our campus. After interacting with them, we realised how common mental fatigue really is among medicos and far more than we expected.

So guys…
We’ve been thinking. Maybe we can’t eliminate mental fatigue fully, but one major reason behind it is definitely high uncontrolled caffeine intake and the crashes that follow. That part we can address.

We’re thinking of building something genuinely helpful, maybe even a brand, but a community driven one. Everyone studies differently, everyone’s brain works differently, so the needs of the community should be shaped by the community itself.

We’ve been formulating for the past three months, and honestly, finding the right proportions is tough. We don’t want to rely on artificial stuff. So we’re using natural ingredients only, like real fruit or flavour powders, because at the end of the day, non-maleficence is a principle we can’t ignore.
Alongside that, we’re reaching out to manufacturers, asking for caffeine analysis reports, talking to an L-theanine supplier (Suntheanine), and trying to understand the cleanest possible way to do this.
At the end of the day, we’re medicos, still learning.
All I know is that in our field, caffeine crashes are real and common.

We want to keep things minimal. No gimmicks like ashwagandha or focus herbs that take days to weeks to show effect. Just evidence-based stuff with full transparency and lab reports.

Many people around me say doctors shouldn’t do anything outside treatments, but honestly, if every other field is innovating, why can’t we?

You know those shops where everything smells like old pages and bad decisions? Anyway, she was standing on her tiptoes trying to reach a book on the top shelf.

I tried to be smooth. I really did.

I walked up and said, Need help?  
She said, Yes, please.  
And that’s when I made the biggest mistake of my week.

Instead of grabbing the book normally, I tried to jump a little to look taller (don’t ask), misjudged the height, smacked the shelf with my wrist, and somehow knocked down *three* books, none of which were the one she wanted.

She stared at me like I just performed the worst magic trick ever.

I said, I swear I’m usually taller than this.  
She laughed so hard she had to put her hand over her mouth.

Eventually, I got the book for her by actually climbing a tiny step ladder that was literally right next to us the whole time. She pointed at it and said, You know this exists, right?

I told her, I saw it, but my pride refused.

She laughed again, and honestly, I think that’s when I got brave enough to keep talking. We ended up chatting in the aisle for like 20 minutes about books, movies, and the fact that I should probably never work in a library.

Before she left, she said, Thanks for rescuing the book… and attacking the shelf for no reason.

Then she added, You seem fun. Want to grab coffee sometime?  
And gave me her number.

So yeah, my attempt to impress her failed spectacularly, but somehow… I guess it still worked?

I’m meeting her next week.

I dropped out of college almost ten years ago, but a few years back I restarted my life and finally completed my degree. Right now I’m focusing on growing in my career. If things go well, I want to retire early, live on my own farm, grow my own food, travel, and stay close to nature.

I’ve never been into drinks. Haven’t even tried tea or coffee. Mostly vegetarian. But I do want to try alcohol once someday, with someone special, just for the memory.

I used to enjoy living alone because it gave me complete freedom and I didn’t have to fear or answer to anyone. Another reason was that I used to think you needed to be exceptionally talented or skilled to have close friends or family. Over time I realised that’s not really true. Being around people, whether it’s family or friends, brings its own kind of comfort and happiness.

A partner is a whole different thing though. Everyone else has their own life, but a life partner is someone you choose to live and grow with through the good and the bad. There will be differences, but that’s what makes it real.

Humans are born with few fears. Everything else we like or dislike is something we pick up from what we see and experience. When two people connect deeply, they naturally change and adapt to each other without even trying. Ideally, having a partner is like having another version of yourself. If you like each other for who you are, things evolve naturally.

An extreme example would be this: if someone ever thinks about doing something wrong, like cheating, they usually talk it out with themselves in their own head first. Now imagine having that same level of honesty and freedom with your partner, where you can talk about anything without fear or judgment. That’s the kind of bond I’d want to build.

The exemptions retroactively took effect at midnight Thursday.

Am I doing things correctly, and what is she doing?","I went through a breakup last year. I went no-contact for a month, then I saw her, invited her for coffee, and confidently told her that I wanted to get her back. And it actually worked. Not immediately—at first she said she didn’t want a relationship—but gradually she started to come back. She was the one texting me, initiating things, and I just let her take the lead. I pulled back, and it worked. After about a month we got back together.

We spent a year together, but now we broke up again.
This time because we have different values and goals. She’s focused on her career, and I’m more family-oriented. We barely spent time together—we would see each other maybe five times a month. She wanted to move into an apartment; we’re both students finishing school, and I told her we should survive one more year in student housing and then move in. She said no.

Now some things have been happening that confuse me.

She suggested we stay friends—which I refused. We’ve been no-contact for a month now. But she reacted to my Instagram story with a heart emoji from a place we both like. When she saw me in person, she couldn’t even open her door properly, maybe she was nervous. I just said “Hi” and kept going. She looked at me, smiled, and asked if I was going to work (I found a part-time job, just like she wanted me to so I could “move forward”). I told her no, that I was going to deal with my internship.

She also texted me on my name day, and it felt nice. I don’t think she’s over me. She once told me she wouldn’t go for a third chance and that she didn’t want to hurt me—but she said that one week after the breakup, when we were just exchanging our stuff. Now her behavior seems different.

At the beginning she even sent me some Reels, but now she stopped and is holding herself back. On the day of the breakup, she apologized twice for her decision. The day after, I went to talk to her and told her I respected her decision, but that I would still give it another try. She didn’t say anything to that. When I was leaving, I kissed her on the forehead and she said, “What are you doing? Friends don’t do that.” And I said, “Then take it as a closing point for the conversation. I’m going to make money now.”

She asked me how I planned to show her that I can change if I don’t want to stay in contact with her. I said, “I don’t know, you’ll see.”

Now I’m just posting normal Instagram stories—nothing sad, nothing aimed at her. Just my life: work, school, and one picture in the elevator where I was dressed well. One photo from the cinema. And the scenic view where she reacted with a heart.

We just met, and yet I find myself replaying the moments like scenes from a quiet film. It started with a joke, but what stayed with me was the way you filled the space - not just with words, but with presence. Your perfume lingered in the car, sweet and strong, like a scent that didn’t ask to be remembered but was anyway.

The night before, we talked. I didn’t want it to end. I felt like you didn’t either. And even when it did, you still messaged me. I told you to sleep, even though I wanted more of you. That’s how I knew I cared, when I chose your rest over my longing.

I woke up before my alarm just to wish you luck. I don’t do that often. But something about you made me want to show up, even in small ways.

You were tired, but you still met me. I was nervous, unsure, but you made it feel okay. You talked, and I listened - grateful for the noise, because my head was blank. I didn’t say much, but I felt a lot.

We got coffee. I parked instead of driving through. I wanted more time. I wanted to sit beside you, but I didn’t ask. I wasn’t sure if I was allowed to want that.

I said I just wanted to be friends. Maybe I meant it. Maybe I was protecting myself. But now I’m here, wondering why I keep seeing possibility. Is it your charm? Or is it me, always searching for something to hold?

1oym1fc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oym1fc,Seeking guidance - Adding inverter into an existing system,"Greetings gang,

I'm seeking guidance and input from you on my solar setup I'm about to pull the trigger on.

   I had installed into our home about a decade ago a 240V generator port that runs to a separate panel where our circuits are that I wanted powered when we have a power loss.  It's running circuits like lights, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, internet/tv, a few fans and the garage doors.  The panel itself (see pic below) has a manual transfer switch to swap over to generator input when required.

   Just after hurricane Helene, I made the decision to go solar in my emergency preparedness.  Here's my plan, and I want you guys to provide insight, guidance and input on.

   I'm considering buying a 6500W Sungold 120/240 Split Phase all-in-one inverter and tying it directly to the generator input.  I've got a few (5) 400W panels I'll wire in as well.  Plus, I'm looking at a 5kWh wall mounted battery.  Total cost for the inverter and battery is about $1400 after all the tax credits and such.  (I can't pass this deal up...the tax credit disappears in a few weeks!)

   This setup would give me a starting point that I can build on.  It's not a long-term solution and I know that 5kWh of battery isn't enough to last for days when the power goes out, but it's a start.  I also have a small EcoFlow Delta 2 and alternator charger I can hook up to our EV and pull power from the EV's 40kWh battery.  My plan is to feed the EcoFlow into the Sungold Inverter for a bit of additional power, albeit only 800W but it's the battery capacity of the EV I'm after there.  In a multi day outage, that should give me some breathing room.

   My questions for you all:

1) Once I have all this setup, can I safely run the inverter at the same time I'm powering the rest of the house via mains?  My understanding is when I throw the switch on that manual transfer box, it totally isolates those circuits from the main and the rest of the house.  

2) Can I feed the 120V single phase from the EcoFlow into the main AC input of the Sungold Inverter?  The inverter is wired for 220 (L, L, N, G), so I'd be either leaving one of the L connections empty.

3) Do you see any holes or gothas in my plans?

**(1:49pm) 1/18/2015:** Jenny texted me saying ""Hey babe, you wanna watch a movie tonight? Your pick. "" I don't know if this is related to any of this or if it's just to throw me off. Dunno what I should say. Carly texted my brother saying ""sorry for being MIA. I missed you ;)"" 

There are only three security cameras we're putting up, and they're going to be hidden well. She won't be able to see them.

**(1:56pm) 1/18/2015:** Holy crap guys this is a throwaway account but thank you for the gold, makes it easy to view all the comments. Karma doesn't matter to me since it's a throwaway to all the people saying I'm making this up. If Jenny confesses to me, I'll act surprised and I'll only tell her about all this after I speak to my divorce lawyer tomorrow and he tells me what I should do. Thank you all for the advice. Now it's a race to setup and hide the cameras. They are on their phones at the coffee shop still. 

About the cameras, we've been talking about installing security cameras for a while anyways, for safety measures. That will count as consent.

**(2:05PM) 1/18/2015:** They're still at the Starbucks, PI tells me Carly is nervously looking around again as if she's restless. These aren't official security cameras, just a few makeshift recording devices. I'd have to call a company to set up official cameras in and around my house, or It would take a few days as a DIY project.

**(2:22pm) 1/18/2015:** They've left the coffee shop. Both of them are in the car talking. So Zack and X are at home now, it's just Jenny and Carly in their ""girls night out"". Bastards.

Live updates:
**(2:39pm) 1/18/2015:** They're on their way to the hotel again. Don't know what they're up to now. Possibly retrieving their things before coming home.

**(2:47pm) 1/18/2015:** They've arrived at the hotel. Instead of normally walking in, they clearly were in a hurry and lightly jogged/speed walked inside. Either they just wanted to walk faster, or they know somethings up. Jenny is talking on her cell phone standing outside the door of the hotel and Carly is waiting for her inside the lobby. Jenny isn't calling me or my brother, so I don't know who she's talking to. 

Already at the top of the TIFU front page wtf

**(2:52pm) 1/18/2015:** Jenny is still talking on the phone, Carly has joined her outside and they are taking turns talking. My brother is racing to get a couple cameras set up. This will be close.

**(2:54pm) 1/18/2015:** Friends called and asked if I'm still gonna join them to watch Football in a few hours, not sure if I should decline or continue. I'll think it over.

**(3:00PM) 1/18/2015:** They got their bags and it looks like they checked out of the hotel. They're in the car now getting ready to pull out. PI is getting ready to tail them if they drive off. To everyone asking how Carly texts, she has a replacement phone (Warranty).

**(3:02pm) 1/18/2015:** Bank came through and as requested yesterday afternoon, joint bank account is frozen. I will be notified about any withdraws from my personal account (in case info was stolen) for the next 2 weeks. 

**(3:07pm) 1/18/2015:** I guess they love talking in coffee shops and in cars, because they're still in the car talking. I don't know who they were speaking to on the phone. I have the Seahawks-Packers game on TV to my left with brother watching, surveillance up on my right computer monitor and this post up on my left monitor, and checking phone for written updates from PI. This is getting hectic.

**(3:15pm) 1/18/2015:** They've pulled out of the hotel, isn't clear where they're going, PI is tailing. Brother is trying to hide the recorders.

**(3:20pm) 1/18/2015:** We only have two recorders in the house, we'll need to run out and get one or two more. If Jenny and Carly drive home, we won't have time. They are driving towards a familiar area, it includes a grocery store, a few buildings, and the gym I go to.

**(3:23pm) 1/18/2015:** It's too risky to go out for more recorders, looks like we'll just stay with the two that we have. They're getting closer to the gym/grocery store area.

**(5:44pm) 1/18/2015:** Shit is going down. I can't type for more than a minute right now. Nobody has gotten hurt or anything, just a lot of shit. I'll update when I get the chance, maybe at my buddy's place. I'm probably getting out of here to watch the game. This isn't a pleasant place to be :( I'm trying to get through this. Tears were shed, anger, grief, yelling, my goodness. Nothing physical at all.

**(3:27pm) 1/18/2015:** They've left the grocery/gym area, they could be heading home. They're 20 minutes away, just in case they come here, what should we say?

**(3:32pm) 1/18/2015:** They're on a route that leads here. I was prepared for this. I'm running programs that are wiping history and data off my phone and computer. This will take a few minutes. My brother and I are just acting like nothing is up and we're watching the game before going to hang with some friends in a few hours.

**(3:39pm) 1/18/2015:** They're definitely on their way here. Recorders are hidden, devices are being wiped, stories are being prepared. This is gonna be a shitty next few hours for me, but you guys will probably enjoy the update after we talk.

God I hope this goes smoothly.

**(3:46pm) 1/18/2015:** They're pulling up to the house, they're almost on the street. ~2 minutes away. Any replies to comments will be made through my phone, can't update posts through mobile. I'll update you guys after everything goes down, it'll be a while. Bracing myself.

Damnnit they were supposed to come home at night when I was gone. They're here. brb.

**(5:49) 1/18/2015:** Shit is going down. Nothing physical though. I can't type for more than a minute or two, but it isn't great. Yelling, anger, sadness, crying, a ton of crying, pleading, explaining, contradicting. This isn't a great place to be right now. I'll update when I'm at my buddy's house, it'll be a while. Sorry I couldn't update sooner. Nobody is hurt at all. You guys are having a great time reading I bet, this is the worst time of my life :(

**(5:51) 1/18/2015:** Jenny is using the bathroom. I'll quickly say the next update that I post at my friends house will be lengthy. And not very good. It went more or less as I expected. The lies I've been told in the past 2 hours, the lies.

I have to get out of here, it isn't pleasant.

A huge part of my life is falling apart around me. I'll find a way to cope, I'm not a bitch, I can get through this. So can my brother. I'll update as soon as I can.

[**[PART 3 w/UPDATES] TIFU by reading my wife's text messages. She's cheating on me.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2sw3is/part_3_wupdates_tifu_by_reading_my_wifes_text/)

Alright, so Jenny and Carly got back from the hotel. I had my devices cleared, and everything looked normal. My brother and I were sitting on the couch watching TV. Jenny opened the front door, and Jenny and Carly walked in. It started with normal ""hey huns"" and ""I missed yous"". They took off their shoes near the door, and Carly went over to sit next to her husband. Jenny just walked up to me and hugged me for a good minute or two. I won't lie, it felt good forgetting about everything and just wrapping each other in our arms. She didn't smell different, so it was easy to forget about the whole affair situation.

She pulled out of the hug, and kissed me like she did Zack for a few seconds. I pulled away and said ""what's up?"" She looked away, I could tell she was beginning to cry, and started sobbing. She got all teary eyed, I almost felt bad for her, and she said ""I'm so sorry honey"". I played dumb and said ""what happened?""

She asked me ""Carly didn't tell you?"". I said ""no"". She told me that she had to makeout with some guy (Zack) and that if she didn't he would let out a dirty secret of hers. I asked her what was the secret and she wouldn't tell me. I told her ""is that all you did? A few kisses isn't that bad if he was blackmailing you. It's ok.""

I asked her ""what about the weekend get away?"" You didn't go on a trip or anything?"" She said no, she had only gone to a hotel where the guy wanted to meet up for some kisses.

Carly clearly looked uncomfortable during this, she kept looking over at us, as if she wanted to say something. I turned to look at Carly, and this is when the truth started to come out. I already knew Jenny had sex, I was playing dumb. Jenny said ""we did a few other things but that's all."" I asked her to tell me what she did. Jenny said she played with Zack's penis, and touched it a little.

Give me break. I got more aggressive and frustrated with her lying and asked her ""are you sure that's all you did?"" Jenny then told me she had to have sex with him just to please him. I grew tired of her giving me tiny bits of the information, so I asked Carly what happened.

Carly told me that Jenny told her they were going to a lodge in the mountains for a weekend. Jenny told Carly that I didn't want to miss the football games, so I was gonna stay home and it was gonna be a fun weekend for them to bond. This is believable, they are best friends. Jenny then took them to Zack's house and she forced Carly to keep her mouth shut or she would tell my brother that Carly was cheating. She showed Carly where she would be in case something happened to her, and dropped Carly back off at the hotel. Carly said Jenny went back to Zack's place for a while, they did something, and came back later with a guy she didn't know. Jenny then had some more sex with Zack while Carly just spoke to the new guy that Jenny brought over. They had a few drinks and went to bed. They dropped them off at their houses, and now they came back home.

False. Bs. Carly lied, she never mentioned meeting X at Starbucks, or the Coffee shop trips at all. My brother was growing more and more frustrated with the lying, so was I. I told Jenny and Carly to come with me. at the dining room table and asked them to give me the whole truth, as their stories didn't add up.

That's when Jenny started bombarding me with ""why don't you trust me?"" and ""we're married, we're supposed to trust each other through thick and thin"". Wrong verse. Carly started to give dirty looks, and she repeatedly rolled her eyes. It's was like I was speaking to toddlers. Jenny was furious, she walked into the kitchen, got a bottle of water and slammed the refrigerator door. My brother heard this, he came over and sat down with us.

The four of us were sitting at a table. My brother and I knew most of the truth, Jenny and Carly knew the whole truth. We had to get it from them.

Jenny started sobbing hysterically. Carly followed. They both cried for 10 minutes maybe, without talking. Jenny came over and hugged me and sobbed into my shoulder. I was gonna miss holding her for sure, she still felt like the same non-cheating person I knew before.

Jenny sat back down and told me the whole truth. Jenny and Carly had made up the whole trip. They wanted to have sex with other people for once. She hooking up. They went over to the Starbucks so Carly could meet the guy she had been seeing for a while prior. Jenny grew paranoid that she was being followed by me and started driving around in circles. She then went back to the shopping center to pick up Carly. X had something to take care of and said he would meet Carly later at the hotel. X is a friend of Carly's and Jenny's. Carly and Jenny then drove to the hotel they were staying at to eat some food.

Later, they went back to the car so they could drive over to Zack's flathouse. Jenny ran over to the car because again, she was paranoid I was following her. They drove over to Zack's house after many turns because she as paranoid I was following her. Jenny showed Carly where she would be if anything happened. Jenny then drove Carly back to the hotel. Carly waited up there for Jenny, Zack, and X to come over. Jenny went back over to Zack's house and they made out in there. They also had sex.

After a while, Jenny and Zack went to the shopping center to pick up X again. With X, they went back to the hotel where they were going to have sex. As I guessed, Carly got cold feet and didn't want to do it. Jenny and Zack however did have sex, multiple times. Carly ratted out Jenny right away so she wouldn't be involved with anything. They all had a bunch of drinks and got drunk. After Jenny and Zack had sex once more, they went to bed. Carly and X hung out all night, nothing romantic except for hand holding.

They woke up, ate food, dropped everyone off at their houses (kissed Zack), and drove the Coffee shop. There they talked extensively about what the would tell us to cover up what happened. They got too confused and just decided to wing it. They went back to the hotel, got their things, and checked out. They left out the part about driving to the gym/grocery area, and said they just drove home. Instead of lying, they broke down and couldn't do it so now they're admitting what they did. They also didn't say anything about the person they talked to on the phone outside the hotel.

So, from what they told me, Jenny had sex, Carly did not but was going to. I don't know what to believe. Jenny again, hugged me and sobbed into my chest, ruining my shirt. Carly cried, but didn't approach her husband.

My brother had a look of relief on his face, but also slight anger. He scolded them about lying for maybe 15 minutes, then again about how badly they had hurt us, and they cried more. I was furious. I thought what we had was great, she never once showed signs of wanting to hook up with other people. I asked her how long this had been going on and how they were meeting each other, but she didn't say anything. After a few more minutes of crying, she said a few weeks, that was the first time they had sex. I was devastated, but I understood that this is what she wanted. Sure, she played with my feelings, but she's not a person fond of commitment at heart. She wants to sleep around, and that's fine with me.

That's just not happening when we're together, so I'm continuing with the divorce process. Fuck her. My brother and Carly talked in our bedroom. There was tons of yelling and crying on both parts, and they came out after 20 minutes. They looked like they had made up, and they went home. I was upset, Jenny kept telling me we could work through this, she didn't want lose me, and that it would never happen again. I just left the table and went back to watching TV. She started yelling at me about how I was betraying her and that we are life partners and we can't divorce. She came over and tried to sit on top of me in a cute way, but I rejected. She got all pouty like she normally does when she's upset and went upstairs to use the restroom. Holy mood swings.

That's when I wrote that quick update. I told Jenny that we'd talk about it later tonight, and that I was still on with my friends to watch the football game. She pleaded to me one last time, but I wasn't budging. She said she had a date planned for us and I'd have a sexy surprise waiting for me for when I got back. She winked at me and said sorry, I walked out the door. I didn't say anything about the investigation I have going on.

Here I am, at my friend's house. They're clearly enjoying the game, I'm writing a depressing and devastating story on Reddit. Still on with the lawyer tomorrow morning.

Thank you all for the support these past few days, it has meant a lot to me. I'll post an update on what happens with the divorce lawyer, one about what happens when I get back home, and I might post a complete update post on everything on Monday/Tuesday @ r/relationships.

I'll retrieve call and text logs to find out who she was calling when they were outside the hotel.

Either way, my head is spinning and I don't know what to think about all this. There are so many questions that need answering. My brother is supposedly fine now, I'm still devastated. The next few months will be tough, but I think I can get through it. Jenny is at home alone now.

EDIT: Forgot to add Jenny has texted me 13 times to ""come home"" and ""she misses me"".

EDIT 2: I'm probably done updating for tonight, I'm not feeling up to it. I'll read and reply to some comments, but I can't get to all of them. Goodnight guys, thanks for the support

EDIT 3: **(12:56pm) 1/19/2015** Hey. So my sexy surprise last night was pretty terrible. I walked into the house pretty pissed and Jenny had literally everything I like prepared for me. My favorite meal, the outfit of hers that I liked, etc. I didn't know what to do, this felt so many like some of our old nights together that we loved.

I didn't give in sexually, but I was pretty hungry. I sat down with her and we ate, pretty much in complete silence. She had the nerve to ask me ""are you still upset with me?"" I just looked at her, and she knew it. I finished eating and started heading upstairs. She chased after me, grabbed my hand, and once again, cried into me. Although this wasn't a whole bunch of tears like earlier, she was still sad.

You know, throughout all this, I still see flashes of the person I used to love so much. They way she walks, the mannerism when she brushes her hair back, etc. I realized, this is just her way of guilting me, I'm not gonna stay with someone who I can't trust, second guessing everything they tell me. I told her to ""leave me alone, we'll talk some more tomorrow.""

I go through my routine and go to bed, where she is waiting for me with one last attempt to have sex. I finally told her ""this isn't happening, and you know it. You have Zack on speed dial, call him if you want a quick fuck."" Out of rage, or maybe to prove that she doesn't love him anymore, she smashed her phone on the floor. She said ""I told you I don't like him anymore! I want to be with *you** and only you!* Our bedroom floor is carpet, so her phone didn't break but the sim card and battery flew out which made it look bad (a.k.a cracked back). I told her to ""pick up your fucking phone and stop bothering me, I'm trying to go to sleep. You should've thought about our relationship when you went around sleeping with other people"".

More crying, and she fell asleep that way. I fell asleep afterwards, and we didn't have sex. I woke up this morning at 5am without waking her, hit the gym for an hour and went to the divorce lawyer. He has told me to not tell her anything about the PI investigation or anything else involving the divorce. He thinks it would be wise if I thought this over thoroughly, as after divorce it would be tough to go back. He told me to give him a call when I was ready to move forward. I received a copy of the prenuptial agreement, and we read it over. It's still valid (thank god). He didn't have much time to speak with me since he shouldn't have been in office for MLK but he has me and one other client early and he wanted to go back home.

I'm planning on calling him tomorrow morning to move forward with the process, there is no way at all I'm staying with Jenny. After the meeting, I texted my brother and asked him how things were going. He said ""about back to normal."" Well, good for him. It's weird, I'm happy for him, but I kinda wish I had a partner to go through this with me together. It's tough getting a divorce, but I'm not a bitch and I can get through this.

Jenny texted me this morning asking ""where are you?"" a few times. I didn't reply. I'm at home now, it's pretty awkward. She's trying to set a movie date with us tonight, and I keep rejecting.

To clear up a few things: Some people are telling me I'm bragging on these posts. I never said I have a huge cock, never said I was insanely attractive, never said I'm filthy rich or have a great job. I don't consider myself above anyone at all. The only reason the sexual details were included is because it's a common reason to divorce. A lot of divorces are over sexual dissatisfaction.

And, thank you all for the support. There is no way I'll be able to read all these replies and PMs, but I'll try to reply to as many as I can. There will probably be a couple more updates here, and I'll post another update thread in a few months on how I'm doing and how the divorce went.

Again, thanks for the golds, but this is a throwaway as I've mentioned. It'll make it much easier to read comments, so thanks!

EDIT 4: **(3:15pm) 1/20/2015:** Alright. Sorry for delay in updates recently, it's just tough updating when Jenny is home. I don't want her to find out about the posts so I have to open a new window whenever she walks by. As a result, it takes while to write a post that should take just 30 minutes.

Anyways, Jenny tried to drag me to the movies last night. She said if we spent some time alone clearing our minds, we might be able to rethink this situation thoroughly and realize we are perfect for each other. I wanted to watch American Sniper anyways, but I didn't want to go to the movies alone, so I gave in since she was pestering me. When we got into the theater, I immediately started to regret it.

There were countless attempts at holding hands, kissing, wrapping her arm around me or pulling my arm around her, etc. After my rejections, she grew frustrated during the movie and began to shun me. Like a child, she had her head facing the other way from me instead of watching the movie. After that, she started to repeatedly tap me on my thigh over and over and over and over for almost the rest of the movie.

On the drive home, she started crying/shouting at me about how sorry she is. She said she's having nightmares about losing me and she can't imagine a day where she doesn't wake up next to me, etc. I told her ""I don't want to continue a romantic relationship with you. We are getting a divorce."" I asked her to pull over so I could drive since she was acting like a maniac and I was afraid she'd drive us right into traffic. The rest of the drive home was quiet sniffling and silence.

Last night, as a last ditch effort, she tried to initiate one last time. I pulled her off and told her ""no, our sex life is over. After we split you can go back to Zack and we'll be on our separate ways. Until then, stop trying to fucking initiate with me, you'll just get rejected. Let me sleep."" Like the night before, she fell asleep in tears. 

This morning, we woke up at almost the exact same time, which is unusual. I wake up quite early, and she sleeps in. Maybe she stayed up all night and waited for me to get up to talk, idk. Anyways, she said that she wanted to come clean to get everything off of her chest. She couldn't live with herself if she kept ""leading me on"" (whatever that means). 

Carly had sex with X. But that isn't it. They switched partners repeatedly over the weekend. So every M-F combination that is possible with Carly, Jenny, Zack, and X, happened. She said Carly was frightened about my brother finding out, so she stabbed Jenny in the back by snitching on Jenny. In other words, Carly wanted to be the plaintiff, and Jenny to be the defendant, since usually the person who reports first is trusted more. When Carly told Jenny what she did (dumb move), Jenny panicked and sent something similar to me about Carly. So, they both cheated on us with two different partners. Zack and X are mutual friends of the both of them, and all of them had been interested in something sexual for a while now. Jenny said she wanted to see what it was like to taste other fish in the sea, and Carly was tired of the same bland life.

I was once again, devastated and angry that she still hadn't told me the truth even after ""coming clean"" before. An hour ago, I texted my brother asking him if he could swing by my house later today with Carly so we could talk about something. He instead told me to come over to his house tonight with Jenny. Keep in mind, I hadn't even told him about Carly cheating yet, but he already wanted me to bring Jenny along... So maybe Carly came clean to him? 

Jenny is nervous about going over there later, she isn't eating much or speaking much.

I received the call logs from Jenny's phone over the past few days. The person she and Carly were talking to outside the hotel wasn't Zack, it was a number I've never seen before(X?). She contacted the Bank once, probably about the frozen joint account or she was trying to drain the account. She also called Carly multiple times during the trip. Her phone is broken now, so she hasn't made any calls in the past day or so. Zack is probably wondering why she hasn't spoken to him recently.

The divorce lawyer and I have a follow up meeting scheduled for Thursday afternoon. We're planning on going through with the divorce. I'll be informing Jenny she'll need to hire a lawyer soon. She probably isn't taking me seriously, but she will when she sees the prenup with the cheating clause highlighted.

It's weird the amount of publicity my situation is receiving (Fox news, Dailymail, radio shows, etc.), it's a constant reminder about how shitty these next few months are going to be and also raises the probability of her finding out about this. I cant go 2 minutes without thinking about the affair. I can't even browse this sub without seeing PI or Jenny and Carly jokes in the comment section of almost every post. Hopefully in time it'll be less painful and more of a funny joke to me. Still hurts thinking about two different guys fucking my soon to be ex-wife, possibly even at the same time.

Thank you all for the support, another update is coming this evening after I speak with my brother and Carly, and maybe another one during the day if something new unfolds.
1 comment = 1 prayer

**(3:53pm) 1/20/2015:** What the heck I had no idea Brazzers was offering me a free subscription haha. Nice peoplethey are. 

**(4:45pm) 1/20/2015:** Heading to my bro's soon. posted comment somewhere jokingly mentioning my favorite movies. Those are not my favorite movies of all time! They don't even crack my top 3!

**(5:05pm) 1/20/2015:** Leaving in a few minutes, Jenny's getting ready. Should be a shitty next few hours. I'm getting so much support in my inbox it's unbelievable, I can't even read 1/5 of the messages. Thanks everyone. 

**(5:07pm) 1/20/2015:** If it makes some people feel better, I'll try to explain any ""inconsistencies"" or problems people have with the story when I get back tonight or tomorrow. Update tonight will be about the shitty talk I'm about to have.

**(5:10PM) 1/20/2015:** Proof will be posted after the divorce case is settled. Official proof to calm down the nonbelievers.

EDIT 5: **(11:10pm) 1/20/2015:** Jenny and I pulled up at my brother & Carly's house. After ringing the doorbell, and waiting for what felt like an eternity, Carly answered the door. She looked sad, and her eyes were swollen as if she had been crying for a while. We entered, and my brother was waiting for us in the living room. I walked over and took a seat next to him. Jenny tried to sit next to Carly, but Carly got up and walked to a seat across the room. You could almost taste the tension in the room.

Without beating around the bush, my brother got right into it. My brother said Carly told him that Jenny pushed Carly into having sex with Zack/ X, that it wasn't her choice. Carly must've came clean to my brother about having sex with Zack and/or X. Carly spoke up and said if it was her choice, she wouldn't have done and she would've remained faithful to my brother. Carly said Jenny turned into a bad influence recently and kept nudging her towards an affair, but she kept resisting. Finally, to stop the pestering, Carly gave in. Carly said again that ""Jenny isn't a positive influence you want in your life"" and the old Jenny she knew, the kind, faithful, loving one was gone. Jenny looked furious. She shouted ""YOU FUCKING LIAR."" Jenny admitted that they both had sex because they both wanted to try new things, she didn't force anyone to do anything. I spoke up and for the first time in a long time, took Jenny's side. I questioned my brother, asking him if he actually believed the bullshit Carly was spewing out of her mouth. I told him there was no way Jenny forced anyone to do anything, otherwise Carly would've sneak texted one of us earlier on
about this whole thing.

Emotional breakdown commence. Carly wept for 10 minutes straight, mumbling out words nobody could understand. Jenny surprisingly just stared at her in anger instead of joining in. Carly eventually came clean, telling us that they both agreed to it and wanted to try something new. My brother was once again furious and started marching around the house slamming doors. He has a tough time controlling his anger. Finally, we all knew the complete truth. Jenny and Carly consented to having sex with two men on a fake ""girl's night(s) out"". My brother calmed down, but was still visibly upset, and returned to the living room. There was nothing left to say, we all knew what was coming, a dual divorce. After we had cleared everything up, everyone stood up as you normally do when guests are leaving, and Jenny and I were getting ready to leave. Carly walks across the room and hugs Jenny, even after Jenny nicely resists a few times. It lasts a few seconds, and Jenny pulls out. They're both looking at each other now.

""crack!"" 

Jenny slapped Carly across the face. Now, it wasn't so hard that she'd lose consciousness or be thrown into another dimension, but it left a mark. Jenny clearly wasn't having any of this blaming bullshit. She turned and quickly ran out the door. I apologized profusely and followed her out the door. My brother texted me when we got home saying it's ok and he's pretty pissed about Carly embarrassing him like that with a lie in front of all of us. Needless to say, Carly and Jenny won't be speaking to each other for a while.

As you all know, after Jenny smashed her phone on the floor and aggressively placed it on hard tables multiple times, her phone stopped working properly. I saw this firsthand when I got home from the divorce lawyer. See, I retrieved the call/text logs from the past few days and noticed there were no texts since the incident, nor were there any calls. There were calls during the girls' trip though. I'm not 100% certain whether or not her phone ceased to work immediately after the bedroom phone smash or if it worked for a while then stopped. 

As I said, the morning after Jenny smashed her phone on the ground and I returned from the divorce lawyer, she texted me. Jenny was either using her phone which was barely working (not likely), or her iPad since it only requires WiFi to text using iMessage, not a cell phone plan. ¡Messages do NOT come up on the text/call logs since they don't use the carrier's service, they use Apple's servers. When she texted me, I didn't think it through and thought it was just a normal iMessage text. I had different, more serious and important divorce things on my mind than which device she used to contact me. Jenny had been switching between normal texts and iMessage while speaking with Zack.

This evening I entered Jenny's iPad password and went into iMessage. She had been texting Zack and an unknown number (probably X). I read through the conversations, and Jenny broke up with both of them. She said she didn't want to have any further ties with them and the sex was going to stop. X and Zack agreed and they haven't spoken since. So Jenny had actually broken off her relationship with them, she wasn't lying..

Jenny kissed me goodnight (I had no time to react, she didn't hold me down and force it or anything just a quick few second long kiss which is fine I guess) and went to bed. I'm typing this on the computer and I'm heading up soon. She hasn't cried or begged for sex or affection, I guess she understands now that it's done.

Now, all me and my brother have to do is file for divorces and we'll be back to bachelor lives without wives. We aren't divorcing each other we're divorcing our wives jeesus.

Also, if you think the story is fake (it isn't), please refrain from spamming my inbox with ""you're a karma whore"", ""good story better karma rewards*"", etc. I want to see the messages where people are actually sending advice or giving me feedback, not a whole bunch of useless insults. Thanks.

**(11:27pm) 1/20/2015:** Tomorrow I might post a straw poll on whether or not me and my bro should get revenge or something. No, revenge is petty never mind. Also, It seems this crowd of Redditors at night is a lot nicer and less
volatile, I like you guys.

**(11:51pm) 1/20/2015:** Me right now

**(11:56pm) 1/20/2015:** Heading to bed very soon. I'll still be replying to some comments though I can't get to all of
them.

**(12:51am) 1/21/2015:** I guess we're the reason Reddit's servers have been so fucked in the past few days? Shall add ""broke the internet"" to my resume. I'll reply to some more comments and head to bed, thank you all for the support these past few days. I'll update this situation tomorrow, although I'll probably have to make a new post since it'll be at the max character limit if you guys still want to see updates. Goodnight. (1:38am) 1/21/2015: No, I don't think I'm so important that I needed the disclaimer. I'm getting tons of messages asking to turn this into a short film, book, movie on kickstarter, etc. I needed to put that there. That's in the off chance someone took this as something more serious than just some guy and his brother's divorce stories. And many people advised me to post the disclaimer since it made it onto the news. Just following advice. I'm getting tons of messages about it, I won't be able to reply to all of them I'm sorry.

EDIT 5: **(4:20pm) 1/21/2015:** As usual, I woke up early, hit the gym, and returned home in time for breakfast. Jenny was up by the time I got home and sitting at the table eating breakfast while having a plate out for me. Again, she woke up early when she normally doesn't. I don't know why I let her cook for me, I didn't ask for it but I wasn't gonna throw out a perfectly good breakfast, as I knew she didn't poison me or anything like that. It felt so much like our time together pre-affair. Sitting together, eating, and casually speaking. She stopped trying to initiate or be all romantic, aside from occasional shoulder brushes and a peck once in a while. There's nothing I can do to stop those things, it happens in a second and I don't have time to react. 

Anyways, while finishing up breakfast we heard the doorbell ring. I went to answer the door. It was Carly and a police officer. This was the non-emergency kind of officer, the kind that settles minor disputes. She called him over to supervise us in case things got physical again. We didn't get any heads up she was coming. Whatever, that's fine. 

Carly got right to it. She explained clearly that she did not want any of us to contact her ever again. Carly said she didn't want to speak with us, and she's had enough of all this drama and shadiness bs. We had ruined her life and caused her to become such an unstable person. Apparently she has depression and she's developed a fingernail biting habit because of us(???). To clarify, myself, Jenny, and my brother weren't to speak to her ever again unless it was related to the divorce case between her and my brother. Jenny tried to speak up, but Carly shushed her before she
could say anything.

Carly is also setting up a restraining order against Jenny and I, and another one against my brother after their divorce is final. She said we'll have to pay a fine to the tune of $1000 if we come within 1000 feet of her. I looked over at the officer to confirm if what she was saying is possible, but he shrugged his shoulders. Carly is staying at a hotel until her divorce is final. Also, if Jenny hears any rumors she is not allowed to spread them. Carly also said she's afraid she might have gotten an STD from Jenny and she's going to get tested ASAP. I'm also getting tested soon. 

I was close to blowing up and asking her what the fuck she was doing in our house coming in with an officer explaining this bullshit that obviously won't hold up in court, but I let it slide. Jenny was growing aggravated, but she held it in as well. Carly smirked and walked out the door behind the officer. Jenny tried to trip her from behind, but Carly caught herself, told the officer, and glared at Jenny. Jenny received a warning from the officer. 

So, Carly isn't speaking to my brother, me, or Jenny. Jenny and I are getting a divorce. Clearly now so are my brother and Carly. Soon, it'll just be me and my brother, and two best friends who threw away their lives split apart by a dumb idea. Jenny and Carly will be cut out from our lives as soon as this is all over. Also, I've requested Jenny's parents come over Saturday during a time when Jenny is out. We'll talk about this situation. 

**(4:30pm) 1/21/2015:** Meant officer, not brother. Just went over it. Brother came to mind first since we're talking about Carly and she's his ex-wife. Haven't spoken to my brother since our text. 

**(4:37pm) 1/21/2015:** Wow thank you all for the kind PMs. I can't even read them all there's so many every time I refresh there's a few more. 

TL;DR: Jenny cheated, Carly also cheated on my brother, my brother and I are divorcing our wives.

[**TIFU by reading my wife's text messages. She's cheating on me**](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2snn0q/tifu_by_reading_my_wifes_text_messages_shes/)

I posted this on r/relationships and people recommended I post it here.

My wife (Jenny) and I have been married for 8 years. We met when we were 22 and we had both just graduated from university. It's been great so far, we haven't had a huge argument where we've had to separate for a period of time or anything like that. Also, we have given each other our passwords to our phones and personal emails.

Well, Jenny was sleeping this morning and my brother shot her a text. My brother's wife (Carly) and Jenny are planning on going out of town for a get-away while my brother, I, and some friends are going to watch football on Sunday and hang out during the weekend. He was asking Jenny to text Carly on his phone because Carly dropped her phone in the toilet. My brother and Carly were basically sharing phones for the time being till she gets a new phone.

I decided to open up the phone and reply something stupid and funny in order to embarrass Jenny. So I opened up the iMessage app and went to read their previous conversation to see what was happening, so I could tell a relevant joke. 2nd to the top of the list of conversations was a chat with a guy/girl named Zack. I didn't know who Zack was, but the most recent thing he sent her was ""<3 gn"". I was curious, so I put off replying to my brother and opened up Jenny and Zack's chat.

To my horror, there was sexually explicit talk of what he wanted to do to Jenny when she ""crawled up next to his sack."" What a filthy beast. I scroll up, and there are multiple nudes from both of them waiting for me to discover. Most of them are dated sometime between 1-4am (usually I'm sleeping then, smart.) so I knew she was obviously trying to hide it from me.

I realized my wife is cheating on me. I took a moment to realize that this was the end of our marriage. All of our happy times, our foreign trips, and our romantic nights must have meant nothing to her. I put the phone down and went to the bathroom to freshen up while Jenny was still sleeping.

I carry on with my day, make breakfast and wake her up. While she was sleeping, her phone went off 7 times (yes, I counted) and they were good morning texts from Zack and a confirmation to see if she was still visiting him this weekend.

She went to the bathroom and I heard her phone vibrate loudly since it was placed on the bathroom countertop. I heard the sounds of typing, and the send button. This happened 3 times while she was in there. As she was coming out, I quickly went downstairs to pretend like I was doing nothing out of the ordinary. We eat, she goes to take a shower and I try to open up her phone.

Jenny changed her phone password. I must have been acting a little weird/distant, or she thought it was time to secure her phone since we've been so comfortable around each other for the past few years. I tried to open up her Facebook and email, but the passwords to those were changed as well. 

Jenny has gone out with some ""friends"" tonight. She thinks she lost her phone. Nope, I stole it before she left so I could try and break into it. I went through a massive hassle to unlock her phone but I finally did it. She's cheating on me. They talk about sex positions they want to try, how far Zack can shove his cock down her throat, and one short conversation about meeting up this weekend. My bitch sister in law Carly must be in on this.

I've erased all trace of me breaking into her phone. I don't know what to do now. Jenny is cheating on me but we've had no major problems in the time we've been together. We still have sex 4-5 times a week and I make her cum a couple times during each session; we still go out on dates and cuddle sometimes when we're home. I don't get it. She's on birth control since I told her we should wait a little bit before we have kids thank god. We're both fit and still attractive I guess so it isn't about looks. I have a bigger penis than the other guy if that's what she desires. I don't mean to compare it's just primal instinct fighting over a mate.

Should I tell her I know? Should we split and file divorce right away? Should I tell my brother Carly is in on this? Get revenge? I've got a prenup in place with a cheating clause since I make much much more than her (212k-30k) thankfully so I won't be getting shafted. I'm thinking on finding out more about the situation (tail gating when she travels?) and then coming to a conclusion, since Carly might not even know about this. I'm not even sure if they're actually leaving town or she just wants to spend time with him. Sorry if I'm rambling and I don't make much sense, I'm just really pissed. Goddammit I loved her :/

I have screenshotted the texts and emailed them to myself. I feel like someone has shot me in the stomach :(

**EDIT:** By popular request I will post an update with the bigger changes and results of the PI investigation on r/relationships. Sometime after the weekend (Late Sunday or Monday/Tuesday). I will link it in an edit here so save the post or check my profile on Monday and Tuesday.

**EDIT 2:** Thank you all so much for the supportive comments, it means a lot to me. It's a struggle keeping a straight face around her, but I'm fighting through it for this last week.

**LIVE UPDATES**

**(5:15pm) 1/16/2015:** Private Investigator hired to tail her Saturday, Sunday and Monday

**(6:00pm) 1/16/2015:** It took a while, but passwords to everything changed, backed up personal info, created throwaway email to send proof to.

**(6:47pm) 1/16/2015:** She's home, It really sucks speaking to her normally, but I'm dealing with it. No sex. Also, I've found 3 excellent divorce lawyers for myself. Luckily I make much more than her so I can afford an excellent lawyer while she can only afford a mediocre one at best.

**(8:13pm) 1/16/2015:** Hired a divorce lawyer (pricey) but he's known to do excellent work. I'm in good hands. It's tempting to have sex, my soon to be ex-wife is trying extra hard to seduce me tonight for some reason. She's either super horny or is trying to get me to have sex with her as a form of infidelity forgiveness.

**(8:54pm) 1/16/2015:** Godd*mmit she's on her phone texting again in the bathroom. I can hear the send button being pressed over and over. It's probably nudes and sexy talk. Jeesus this hurts.

**(9:55pm) 1/16/2015:** She went to bed, I'm sitting here watching TV on my laptop. She's trying to initiate sex, I of course have to decline. I went to have sex with her but I'll control myself. Despite what she did being unforgivable, she's still beautiful on the outside.

**(10:17pm) 1/16/2015:** Heading to bed, I'll update some more tomorrow after getting up. I cannot stress how thankful I am for all this positive support. It means a lot to me. But, no matter what, it'll take many months or even a year or two to get over this sh*tty situation. I hate to say it but she's pretty on the outside. She's just f*cked up on the inside.

**(11:04pm) 1/16/2015:** I got caught up watching TV. Now I'm actually going to bed. Goodnight!

**(9:14am) 1/17/2015:** I woke up a little late today if I wanted to break into her phone since it'd take a while, so I won't do it today. She's still asleep. The PI will be following her vehicle starting at 10am today. Jenny and Carly are heading on their ""weekend trip"" today at 12pm. She'll have some breakfast, Carly will swing by here, and they'll take Jenny's car and head off. The PI will be tailing them all day, I'm excited to see what he finds. He offered to take me around with him, but I politely declined. I've got some sh*t to do today anyways. Really a great start to the day, 10 hours of sleep, I don't get that often! Thanks for the gold, but this is a throwaway account haha.

**(9:55am) 1/17/2015:** As I go through the replies, a few people have told me why I included the sexual details, as if I'm bragging. I included them because that is one of the most common reasons people cheat. They aren't getting satisfied, partner is too small, different sex drive levels, etc. Hint Hint: /r/deadbedrooms

**(10:08am) 1/17/2015:** PI is posted down the street waiting for her vehicle to pull out with Carly. She woke up about 10 minutes ago and I'm about to cook her breakfast. Carly is showing up a little earlier today at around 10:30am so I'm cooking her breakfast too. Can't believe I'm wasting my sh*t on these people but you do what you gotta do to keep everything under wraps. I have another meeting with the divorce lawyer today at 1pm.

**(10:29am) 1/17/2015:** People calling this fake, divorce attorneys are open on Friday evenings, you can find one through online databases. Also, PIs have flexible hours just because of the type of work they do so I hired one quickly since it was urgent. If you still think it's fake, f*ck off, I don't need your sh*t when I'm going through this tough time.

**(10:40am) 1/17/2015:** Carly has arrived. They're both eating breakfast while I'm watching TV and on my computer. Once they pull out, the PI will begin tailgating.

**(11:50am) 1/17/2015:** They left a bit later than they should have (11am). They got caught up chit chatting and occasionally talking to me. Private Investigator is tailing them now. He's got a camera that zooms in and takes high quality pics from ridiculously far away, an assortment of high quality dash cams, and handheld recorders.

**(12:02pm) 1/17/2015:** The PI will be sending me live updates and I can view one of his cameras on my computer, sort of like a live stream. I'll post a few details here but the main parts will be posted after the investigation in an update on r/relationships on Monday/Tuesday. I'll link the post here so you all can check it out when it's up.

**(12:03pm) 1/17/2015:** She is not heading to the place she told me she was going. Jenny is driving. This doesn't look good.

**(12:14pm) 1/17/2015:** Carly got dropped off at Starbucks. Jenny took the car and left the shopping center. Don't know where she's headed. PI is 10/10 with these updates and live cam.

**(12:19pm) 1/17/2015:** PI is tailing Jenny. She's making sporadic turns left and right ultimately leading to nowhere. She doesn't know he's following because he's very far away, I think she's playing it safe.

**(12:24pm) 1/17/2015:** Divorce attorney and I rescheduled for Monday morning at 7am. I'll hit the divorce attorney, then go to work.

**(12:26pm) 1/17/2015:** Jenny has circled back to the shopping center. She's parked an abnormal distance from the Starbucks and is texting someone. It's probably Carly since they're both on their phones. Carly is texting as seen through the Starbucks window, Jenny is texting in her car at the shopping center.

**(12:30pm) 1/17/2015:** A man walked into Starbucks and is sitting next to Carly. Jenny has parked closer to the Starbucks, seemingly waiting for Carly to come out.

The man could either be:

- A stranger trying to hit on Carly
- A random person sitting next to her since the seats are close to full
- Zack or her own affair partner

**(12:38 pm) 1/17/2015:** The man left the Starbucks and headed on his way. Carly and Jenny have regrouped in the car. They've been talking for the past few minutes, no movement. Carly seems to be on edge, she keeps looking out the window. They know something we don't. This is intense.

**(12:48 pm) 1/17/2015:** Still in the car . . .

**(12:56 pm) 1/17/2015:** Still in the car. The PI is hundreds of yards away zoomed in on his equipment. He is not even in the same shopping center as them. He has slightly tinted windows so it would be hard for them to see him.

**(1:02pm) 1/17/2015:** They've pulled out of the shopping center, PI is tailing. Don't know where they're headed.

**(1:15pm) 1/17/2015:** Still driving. There's a bit of traffic so they haven't gone too far.

**(1:23pm) 1/17/2015:** Carly has been dropped off at a hotel. The hotel is a decent one, not a rusty motel but not crazy Vegas quality either. It's the common ones you see around like Hiltion, Hampton Inn, etc. Jenny is in the parking lot.

**(1:26pm) 1/17/2015:** Jenny has left the car and followed Carly into the hotel.
They're either:

- Going for food or
- Meeting up with their partners

**(1:27pm) 1/17/2015:** PI thinks judging by the way they're moving, they won't be in there for long. This hotel has an iHop, Subway, Pizza Hut and a few other restaurants. They're most likely in for food.

**(1:30pm) 1/17/2015:** The PI is heading into the hotel to see what's up. I have to take a #2, so sorry, I'll update when I get back (10-15 mins).

**(1:49pm) 1/17/2015:** Sorry, I'm back! I'm analyzing updates I got and the past 15 minutes of footage I missed. Composing the update now.

**(2:00pm) 1/17/2015:** Jenny and Carly were eating at a restaurant in the hotel. They're chatting, acting normally like nothing is up. The PI is sitting very far away and out of sight. They don't know he's tailing as they aren't acting nervous at all. A man walked by their table, said a few things and walked away. He was probably a service worker, as he had a tucked in shirt and all that jazz. Judging by the PI's footage, they're almost done with their food and cleaning up. I suspect they'll be heading out to the car. Jenny is constantly checking the clock in the hotel lobby. Her phone appears to be dead, or she doesn't want to use it to check time.

They decide to take the rest of their food ""to-go"" and pack up their items. They exit the hotel, the PI follows at a distance. They break into an all out sprint for the car, I don't know why. Carly is questioning Jenny as to why they're running towards the car. They hop in, and they're talking again. They both seem relaxed, no tension. We don't know why Jenny started sprinting towards the car.

**(2:08pm) 1/17/2015:** They've hit the road. PI is once again tailing their car. They're heading towards residential area, not many businesses or large buildings.

**(2:12pm) 1/17/2015:** Holy sh*t these U-turns. It's like they're trying to shake someone off their tail. They're on their way back to the hotel it seems. There is no way in hell they know about the PI, he's extremely far away. This isn't like the movies where the PI is a few cars down, the PI is at least a hundred feet away. Puzzling.

**(2:15pm) 1/17/2015:** Carly got dropped off at the hotel. Jenny has driven away and is now en route to the resedential area again. Carly was seen waving at Jenny as she drove away. Carly had a hotel key card as she entered the lobby, so she probably has a place to stay. Jenny handed Carly the hotel key card as Carly left the car. They must've already had a room key or got one before the PI could tail them in since he had to wait a small period of time to not look suspicious.

**(2:22pm) 1/17/2015:** Jenny met up at the front of a flathouse in a residential area and kissed a guy before she entered. It's Zack. Cheating confirmed. Carly seems to be clueless about the situation. PI snapped a shot of it, this is about enough evidence. PI might call it off for the day now.

**(2:24pm) 1/17/2015:** They're definitely unaware of the Reddit post. Jenny was careless as she entered the house, didn't try to hurry or anything. What a joke. I don't know why I had my hopes up that nothing was going on. I'm sad now.

**(2:27pm) 1/17/2015:** I'm really sorry for the abrupt update above. She dropped Carly off at the hotel, rushed back to the residential area and entered the house she showed Carly and kissed Zack. She didn't try to cover her tracks, no zig zags, nothing. I expected a build up of some sorts, not a quick confirmation like this... 

**(2:31pm) 1/17/2015:** FUCK. Carly texted my brother about Jenny. So my brother knows, Carly knows, I know. They didn't know I knew, so my brother just told me (text). I need them both to shut up about this and I need to act surprised when one of them call me. In the last 15 minutes everything has come crashing through the roof. 

IF JENNY FINDS OUT I KNOW, THIS IS WHOLE EVIDENCE COLLECTING THING IS RUINED. I need a way to tell them to shut up without giving away what I'm doing. Advice guys pls I'm counting on you all.

Ok, to sum it up:

Carly thought they were going on a girls weekend. I don't know what was going on in the Starbucks, maybe Carly wanted a drink or something. I don't know who talked to Carly. They made some weird turns most likely out of suspicion I was following. They grabbed a bite at the hotel. Jenny sprinted to the car because she was excited or they were messing around. Jenny showed Carly where she'd be for safety in case Jenny never replied again, then she dropped of Carly at the hotel room they're sharing. Jenny then went back to the flat and met up with Zack. They are inside. PI doesn't know what to do next. Stakeout, or go to the hotel, or call it off for the day. This is what I think happened.

The case is ruined if Jenny finds out because I'll ruin my oppurtunity to get even more evidence. I'll be stuck with the video of her entering and the quick entering kiss. I want more. I have this PI guy scheduled till Monday, might as well use it up. 

**(2:41) 1/17/2015:** My head is spinning. This is too much information for 30 minutes. I can't deal.
Carly texted my brother Jenny is cheating. My brother texted me. I cannot have them tell Jenny I know because it'll ruin my opportunity to collect even more evidence to truly cement my case. I'm not sure if a quick kiss and entering a house will suffice the infidelity clause. She might be able to play it off as a friendly greeting. The PI is scheduled till Monday, so I've got more time to collect evidence if my bro and Carly keep their mouths shut.

**(2:54) 1/17/2015:** Welp, I'm gonna eat lunch. I'll be reading replies while I eat but I won't be typing. The PI is staking out Jenny and Zack's place. There will still be juicy updates if they leave the house I'm thinking so stay tuned I guess. I'm at a loss for words. The pleasure of our love lasted a few years, the pain that came of this will last a lifetime. I'll post some more updates in 10-15 mins.

**(3:10pm) 1/17/2015:** Ok, I cooled off while eating lunch, I'm not as hyped up as I was before. The PI has texted me that there is movement in the house. He's just sitting there staking out. Carly is not to be trusted, she doesn't need to know about the evidence. I told my brother to please not talk about the issue and tell Carly not to speak about it as I want time to think about my options. I feel much better now. I still don't know why they went to Starbucks or the guy who the guys it that talked to Carly at Starbucks. It definitely isn't Zack. 

**(3:14pm) 1/17/2015:** I can't speak to the lawyer about how much proof I need because he closed up at 2pm. We have an appointment Monday at 7am. Also, Zack and Jenny are on the front porch, seemingly getting ready to leave the house. 

**(3:18pm) 1/17/2015:** My doorbell was rung, it was someone asking if I was ready to upgrade my cable service. This probably isn't related to anything going on, I'm not gonna get too paranoid. It happens fairly often around here, door-to-door advertising.

Guys calm down about the cable guy. He had a nametag, official car with a big ladder and everything. 

**(3:27pm) 1/17/2015:** Zack and Jenny are relaxing on the front porch, just talking and holding hands. My PI is super far away, they can't see him but he can see them.

**(3:38pm) 1/17/2015:** Zack and Jenny left Zack's house. PI is tailing them. sigh More suspense for us. 

**(3:42pm) 1/17/2015:** Zack and Jenny are heading towards the Starbucks shopping center. Don't know why, I'm guessing they already ate.

**(3:48pm) 1/17/2015:** Jenny and Zack are sitting in the car parked in the shopping center. Just like Carly and Jenny were doing earlier, they're just talking.

**(3:51pm) 1/17/2015:** Remember the guy that met up with Carly in Starbucks? He just got into the car that Zack and Jenny are in. They're all sitting together discussing something. Things are heating up again. I'll post proof later on I'm trying to follow the situation now. It's escalating quickly just like earlier.

**(3:55pm) 1/17/2015:** They've pulled out of the shopping center, PI is tailing. 

**(4:04pm) 1/17/2015:** They have arrived at the hotel. Zack, Jenny, and stranger are heading into the hotel, Carly is inside the hotel somewhere. The stranger is probably the person Carly is having an affair with i'm guessing. If the stranger was a hitman, I'd think he'd be a bit taller or muscular. He looks like an average guy, although he's fairly short. Not sure how the PI can go about following without looking suspicious.

**(4:11pm) 1/17/2015:** My PI followed them into the lobby, Jenny picked up a room key and all 3 of them headed for the elevator. We're essentially blind right now, we don't know what's going on in the hotel room(s). PI want's to know if he should stakeout the hotel or if we should call it a day? It seems like they'll spend the rest of the day in the hotel and they'll also sleep together there.

I think Carly was trying to portray Jenny as the only person who was cheating, that's why she texted my bro right away. I think now if Jenny rats out Carly, Carly will deny it and say Jenny is just saying that because she was caught cheating. Once again, my head is spinning.

**(4:16pm) 1/17/2015:** Okay, so essentially all four of them are inside the hotel doing something, most likely having sex. The thought of my wife having sex with another man makes me want to puke, but I'm coping. There is no way for my PI to get upstairs in the hotel or to find out what's going on in there. He'll stake out the hotel for a few more
hours before heading home.

**(4:28pm) 1/17/2015:** Jenny just texted me that Carly is cheating.................. I actually don't know where to go from 

**(4:41pm) 1/17/2015:** Still not sure what I should reply to Jenny. What should I say? My life is being destroyed here.:/

**I can't stress how thankful I am for all 1000+ of you people giving me helpful advice. Thank you for all the touching PMs. Even the people who are calling this fake and bs, thanks for being here. It means a lot to me during this rough time. Reddit is great. I'll continue to update when I get more info.** 

**(4:48pm) 1/17/2015:** I'm still thinking about what I should say to her, although all most likely ignore it. I don't want to say something I'll regret and mess up this whole thing. 

**(5:00pm) 1/17/2015:** Not much is going on now, they're still in the hotel. My PI is staking out for 1 more hour till he has to go. The updates will get slower and they might pick up in the evening if Jenny comes home or if I get more texts. They're supposed to be spending the night there but who knows. The update post I post on Monday/Tuesday will have all of the ""juicy"" details, so check my profile then to see how it all goes down. Once again, I'll link it here on this post. Thanks for the help today guys, it means a lot to me. Nothing is really going on now, updates will be going up at a slower rate, they might pick up tonight. Other than that, make sure you read Monday/Tuesday's post. It'll have everything that went down from Thurs-Mon.

**(5:34pm) 1/17/2015:** Thank you all for the wonderful PMs, they're great. PI #1 is leaving soon, PI #2 will be doing an evening stakeout until 11pm. R.I.P my inbox haha. They're still in the hotel btw, food is in there too so I'm guessing they'll be in there the rest of the day.

It seems like Jenny convinced Carly to go with her to Zack's house to show her the location just in case something happened to Jenny. Carly would be her guard so to speak. Then Jenny brought Zack and the other guy to the hotel and Carly got cold feet (didn't want to cheat on her husband) so Jenny is stabbing her in the back. I'm not sure, I'll find out what happened in the next few days. That's the only reason I can think of as to why they'd turn on each
other.

**(6:36pm) 1/17/2015:** I'm posting screenshots of the texts for proof in a bit. PI #2 is on the scene and they haven't left the hotel. Things will surely get much more interesting tomorrow. A few things went down, those will be covered in my update post on Mon/Tues. It's pretty crazy. This sucks a lot. Again, thanks for the support! 

**(9:35pm) 1/17/2015:** So I fell asleep, woke up to eat some dinner, and I'm on here again. This was a really boring day, other than the dreaded breakfast I had zero human to human contact (other than the cable guy for a second). I'm fast forwarding through the stakeout footage now and going through the few updates I received. The proof is coming, calm down with that. I'd rather be paying attention to this situation unfolding than worrying about a few people not believing me. When I do post proof (tomorrow morning or tonight) it will be heavily blurred out so nobody will recognize me.

It's just starting to hit me that my life is starting to fall apart around me. It's neat some of you are getting enjoyment out of this, but I'd do anything to go back in time and avoid this whole situation. Goes to show that money does not buy happiness, unless you have a partner and a family. I get some of you might be happy without a spouse and family, but I don't see how you could be. It's this alone feeling that hurts. My parents are dead, I only have one brother, and we both might get destroyed through this affair situation.

He's the last family member I have left and I hate to see us go through something like this together. I won't be the guy in his 50s alone at the bar with nobody to be with. I will move on from this and hopefully find a better partner. Idk, after I woke up it felt like someone had been sitting on my body for the past 3 hours. I hate to complain but this
hurts like a bitch. 

**(9:42pm) 1/17/2015:** I've got texts from Jenny and Carly. Jenny asked me ""what are you doing"" and ""call me when you can"". Carly said ""I'm sorry about Jenny. I'm here if you want to talk about it."" Fuck me for falling asleep like an idiot. I don't know what to reply, if anyone is on here this late and has some advice that'd be great. 

**(10:12pm) 1/17/2015:** Jenny texted me again. She was getting spooked and I didn't want to handle her driving home, probably hammered, worried that I found out. I told her I was at the gym working out, met some friends there, and decided to hang out for a bit. I ended it with ""what's up babe?"". She hasn't replied yet. I've ignored Carly's text, I checked it in the notification bar so it doesn't have the ""read"" sign. Smart, eh? There was no way I could continue to ignore Jenny, she started to text me repeatedly at 10 o'clock, probably worried. She would've done something drastic for sure. I would've liked to ignore her texts, but it wouldn't have turned out well. People do dumb things when they're panicked, sadly she isn't as level headed as I am. 

**(10:31pm) 1/17/2015:** I called my brother and told him about what they texted me, parts of the investigation, etc. He will be here first thing tomorrow morning. I feel better now that he knows what's up and isn't in the dark. Jenny replied to me ""Ok cool hun, I'm gonna go to bed, gn <3"". I replied ""Cool. I already miss you. Goodnight <3"". This playing it cool stuff is tough.

I know it isn't uncommon for people's parents to be dead by the time you're 30, but I just wish my mom was here to comfort me. She was the best at that. If your parents are still alive and you're on good terms with them, don't treat them like shit, and definitely don't take them for granted. They won't be there forever. I didn't treat my mom poorly, I just wish she were here with me. Trying to hold back my tears as I reread everything I'm typing. Again, thank you all for the amazing PMs, I'm replying to as many as I can. 

Everyone concerned about my safety (if she comes home with Carly, etc.), the PI will notify me if they leave the hotel. They probably won't as they are all most likely hammered, and Jenny told me goodnight. 

**(10:44pm) 1/17/2015:** I'm getting offline at 11ish. Nothing new will unfold for the night for sure, the PI has decided to stake out until some time during the middle of the night (3-5 am). I'm trying to reply to as many comments as I can. Thank you all for the support!

**(11:02pm) 1/17/2015:** Just in case something goes down, I've armed all the alarms in the house. If any door or window opens/breaks, I will be alerted with a loud beeping alert. I have a go bag next to me if I need to bail quickly. I've got a pistol in the nightstand. Again, thank you all for the support, this is a ridiculous amount of people here supporting me, and I love it. It's helping me cope. The updates will continue tomorrow, PI #1 will take over again at 8am, I'll be up by around 9-10am, a little later if I can't fall asleep tonight. The pace should pick up once again tomorrow, and I'll also update you guys on the meeting with my brother in the morning. 

Additionally, I won't be posting any proof, since anything I post will be an obvious giveaway if they come across this post. I've changed many details so they won't be able to connect the dots just through the posts, the proof will give it away, so I'm sorry if you don't believe me but I'm not posting any pictures. I'll reply to some posts through my phone as I lay in my bed. I love you all, goodnight. 

**This post won't be on the front page tomorrow, I also highly doubt it will be stickied. Boomark or save if you need to.** Finally, goodnight!

**(9:35am) 1/18/2015:** Just woke up a while ago. Slept a bit longer than I expected. Freshened up quickly, etc. You know, I half expected this to all be a bad dream and Jenny to be sleeping right next to me when I woke up. Sadly, that isn't the case. This is the worst I've felt since my parent's and sister's deaths.

My brother is coming over very soon, he texted me ""morning dude, what time should I come over"", I said half an hour. PI updated me at 4:21am telling me that Jenny and Carly arrived at ground floor were sitting in the hotel lobby talking to each other. They were not up in their rooms. Carly was holding her head as if she was hung over. They returned back up to their room(s) at 4:56am. I still need to fast forward through the night footage. Now, I have to go make breakfast for me and my brother, I'll be back. Hope you all are doing well today!

**(9:44am) 1/18/2015:** Ok, some people are calling me fake for a few reasons. The reason I'm calling Zack's house a flathouse is because it is flat, one story . . . I didn't move from the UK as a kid or anything. Flat = 1 story house. I don't know what kind of person some of you are picturing me as, but I'm not Zac Efron blowing millions everyday. If you saw me, you wouldn't know how much I make, since I don't spend much on unnecessary things like fancy clothes, $10000 watch, etc. Thank you all for the kind PMs, I'm trying to reply to as many as I can, but I'll be fairly busy in about 15 minutes.

**(9:55am) 1/18/2015:** My brother should be here in a few minutes, he's picking up breakfast for us. I'll post an update after we talk. it'll take a while. Hopefully later I get more info or a sighting of Jenny and Co. This will be one of the worst conversations I have in my life, and it's risky. If my brother freaks out, this whole situation could get f*cked up, but if he's calm, even better. He'll be an ally. 

Oh yeah, Jenny is due to come home sometime this afternoon/evening. Mixed feelings about it, still going over what I'm gonna tell her. Be back in a bit. 

Also, don't hesitate to send me a PM or comment because you're afraid it'll get buried. I read everything in my inbox. I'm still reading and will probably continue to go through my inbox after the meeting. Nervous about this meeting, should suck.

**(11:11) 1/18/2015:** Welp, I've learned my brother is not very good in a crisis. When he arrived, we ate and I told him about the whole cheating situation and how I have video. I showed him a screenshot of Jenny kissing Zack and Carly talking to the stranger at Starbucks. I showed him them hung over at the hotel, the texts, etc. He started to freak out. I was afraid he was gonna burn my house down. It took me a good 10 minutes to get him under control. But, he was suprisingly amazingly calm afterwards. It was like he had a short breakdown then went back to his normal state.

We talked over options and decided that we would each act like we didn't know about our spouses cheating, like we were clueless. So I'll act like my brother and Carly never said anything about Jenny, and my brother will act like I haven't told him about Carly. It may or may not work, but we're doing this to keep our spouses under control. The last thing we'd want is our spouses to come home and have a simultaneous freak out trying to damage-control. During the meeting, the PI texted me that they had gone down for food and all four of them were sitting at a table outside a restaurant. Jenny clearly had on male sunglasses, on of the guys brought it with them for their hangover and probably lent it to her. Either way, it was clear they were all in pain from their hangovers, except for the stranger. He seemed completely normal. They had their meal, and went back up to the hotel room.

I'm not sure why they didn't use room service, maybe it's because it's so expensive. My brother and I watched them eating at the hotel. He just stared in horror, I guess realizing that his marriage was over. He cried his eyes out afterwards, I felt so bad for him. I made sure I wouldn't cry, I would not let my emotions get the best of me and cloud my decision making. As of now, they are back up in their hotel rooms, I expect them to leave the hotel in an hour pr two, not much to do there all day other than hang out and.....have sex. 

Jenny texted my brother ""hey"" last night at 1:19am, that's it. He didn't reply to her. Carly has not texted him yet. My brother is still here, calm and collected, watching TV as I use my computer. He doesn't know about this Reddit post, not sure if I should tell him about it. 

Now, me and my brother are waiting for them to make some moves, hopefully leave the hotel and show public displays of affection to cement our divorce cases. We still aren't 100% sure Carly cheated at all, no picture or video proof other than her talking to a guy at Starbucks. Just a few more pictures and videos and we can stop this madness and get on with our divorce cases. He's finding a lawyer tomorrow and will meet with one sometime this week. The mood in this house is so sad, I don't like it one bit. Might have to take a walk or something.

**(12:28pm) 1/18/2015:** Sorry for not posting in an hour, but nothing has unfolded yet. My brother is still here, grieving, and I'm waiting for them to make some moves. They're up and alert by now, we'll see what happens.

**(12:37pm) 1/18/2015:** They've left the hotel. Carly, Jenny, Stranger (let's call him X), and Zack are in Jenny's car. PI will tail as soon as the pull out.

**(12:45pm) 1/18/2015:** They're heading towards a residential area filled with apartments. This is not the area where Zack lives. PI is having a hard time tailing since the area has quick left and right turns and he needs to stay a safe distance without letting them out of sight.

**(12:50) 1/18/2015:** This area is very close to the original shopping center. X must have walked to the shopping center from his house. X has been dropped off at his apartment, he briskly walked into the lobby. They have pulled away and are going somewhere else.

**(12:56pm) 1/18/2015:** They're in Zack's neighborhood. In the car it's Jenny driving, Carly, and Zack. There were no public displays of affection between X and Carly, so my brother doesn't have picture or video proof.

**(1:05pm) 1/18/2015:** Just my lucky day. Zack was dropped off at his flathouse and Jenny got out of the car followed him up the driveway. In plain sight, they passionately made out/kissed for 10-15 seconds, like a farewell kiss. Jenny then went back to the car and is driving again. That's enough proof for my case.
I've got:

- Nudes
- Sexually suggestive texts
- Sexual texts
- Video and picture proof of them kissing and hanging out together

Feels good that I now have more than enough proof. I'm devastated about what I've discovered. Hats off to the PI. Now me and my bro are watching where Carly and Jenny are going. It's just them in the car now. My brothers case is still a mystery, what is Carly up to?

**(1:15pm) 1/18/2015:** They're heading back to the original shopping center.

**(1:20pm) 1/18/2015:** They parked normally, and both of them are inside the Starbucks standing in line to order something. They're talking to each other in line. They literally just ate two hours ago, don't know why they are stopped here.

**(1:24) 1/18/2015:** They're sitting at a table with coffee talking. Probably discussing what they're going to tell me and my brother :/

**(1:30pm) 1/18/2015:** They're still sipping coffee and talking. They may be here for a bit.

**(1:40pm) 1/18/2015:** They're still drinking and talking. Since in my situation it is clear my spouse is cheating, my brother is helping me set up a few surveillance cameras with audio recording in the house. Thank you all for this advice, it will cement my case in the possibility she tries to say I did something to her (hit her, etc.) that I didn't actually do. He seems to have cheered up a bit since we don't have proof that Carly cheated at all, I mean, maybe Jenny had a threesome and Carly was just a witness? I'm not saying that's what happened, but it's always a possibility. We'll just have to listen to what they tell us when they get home. 

Speaking of when they return, what should I do? Play dumb? I don't know how to react, I want to come out to her that I know about all this after my divorce lawyer meeting tomorrow, by then I'll have all my ducks in a row. I hope she doesn't come home and confess to me tonight, I'd rather wait 'till after my divorce lawyer meeting.

Once I popped the top off I saw the plumbing was different, so I am at a loss.  The issue is during the heating cycle before it starts dispensing it will dribble water out over where the coffee mug sits.  Other than that the coffee maker works fine.

I was on holiday and my cat ran away from his cat-sitter. She responded to my FB post and I picked him up a few days later when I got back. I was in a rush since I wanted to unpack but she insisted I stay for coffee. Almost immediately after introducing herself she mentioned she is a widow. We had a pleasant conversation that lasted a few hours.

Since then, whenever we see each other we stop and have a nice interaction. She is always warm and friendly. Earlier in the week, we saw each other for the first time in several months. We spoke outside my house for over an hour, even though she repeatedly said she has to go and cook dinner. She said something about asking her daughter if she thinks I have moved due to not seeing me for some time. I told her I am planning on moving at the end of the year, after which she insisted on helping me house hunt. The next day she drove all over town and looked at several places until she found me a nice place. She also offered to cat-sit for me during the upcoming holidays since she knows I am a student and will want to visit my family.  
  
I really want to ask her out: she is attractive, easy to talk to and single. She also clearly enjoys my company. But I AM SCARED TO DEATH that she is just being a friendly ""neighborhood mom"" and I will embarrass myself. My friends are all convinced she is not just being nice. Any advice?

   * $45
   * [LINK HERE](https://chupsocks.com/collections/chupwool)
   * Beautiful patterns, limited runs.  Darn Tough's get recommended all the time and they are great daily socks but I love the look of Chups for the special occasion.  I thought they were snug at first but they felt better after a couple wears.

      * [LINK HERE](https://www.hmart.com/tokyo-banana-1-06lb--480g-/p)
      * *Tokyo Banana is a #1 popular Japanese souvenir sweet, a small, fluffy sponge cake filled with banana custard cream. It's often shaped like a banana and is known for its soft texture and mild sweetness. The cream filling is made with real strained banana puree. --* Think of it like a little banana Twinkie, around 3 inches or so each.  HMart brought these in last year and were tough to find but they brought them in again this year.  My local HMart carries them but YMMV, the came in a pack of 8.  Great right out of the freezer or thawed.  \*\*\*\*As mentioned, they come frozen, not widely available so others may sell for a silly markup.

      * $10
      * [LINK HERE](https://www.planters.com/product/planters-special-reserve-salted-peanuts/)

   * [BRAILLE BRICKS](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/play-with-braille-english-alphabet-40656)
   * There's a lot of options from LEGO at this price point but I picked these two out since I thought they looked fun.  There's architecture sets, botanical, art, you name it.  I also like the braille bricks because accessibility is incredibly important so if you have someone in your life that is visually impaired, I thought these seemed like a great way for the family to spend time building together.

For background, my grandmother was raised Catholic but converted to Mormonism as a young adult. She raised my dad and his siblings Mormon, but my dad left the church in his teens, well before I was born. My family are all located in the northeast of the US.

  
When I was growing up in the 1990s, if we were going to see my dad's family for a get together, we would always bring caffeine free sodas, as to my understanding at the time Mormons were/are not allowed to have caffeine because it's a drug. 

  
Also, my TBM grandma was fond of drinking a decaf coffee subsitute made from roasted chicory. From what I understood this was because she could not have coffee due to the caffeine content, and decaf coffee still has a little bit of caffeine hence needing a full on substitute. She drank this stuff hot.

  
Come to find out from this sub and various exmo influencers that what the church takes issue with is ""hot drinks"" i.e. coffee and tea, and the hypocrisy of drinking diet coke all day for the caffeine but a regular hot coffee is a no-no. So perhaps we never really needed to make a point of bringing caffeine free sodas to family gatherings? Was my grandma's hot roasted chicory fake coffee drink sinful because it was hot, or was it acceptable because it wasn't coffee? Has the acceptability of caffeine, if it was ever actually forbidden, changed over time, Are there regional quirks to how the ""hot drinks"" rules are applied?



I'm also curious if there are any sort of cultural divides between east coast Mormons and west coast Mormons.

She posts pictures and sometimes bikini pics at least once a week, and I hype her up like a full-time photographer. I tell her, “Queen, go hotter, show them what confidence looks like.” I literally offer to take the pictures for her. But instead of being happy, she says it’s weird how I don’t get jealous, like I’m too comfortable?!! Like i thought this is something she asked for.

She goes clubbing every weekend, often with her male friends, also including two she used to hook up with, and I literally drive her there because I believe in trust and independence. I tell her, “Have fun, text me if you need me,” and she tells me I’m “too passive.” Like, what do you want from me? You want trust or a tracking device? Im trying to show her i trust her and that i love her but she gets mad for me trusting her?

She always insists on paying for everything, dinner, coffee, sometimes even part of my rent, and I let her because I believe in equality. But then she tells me I “lack masculine energy” because I don’t fight her for the bill. She says she feels like she’s dating a roommate instead of a man. I thought letting women pay was modern. Apparently, it’s emasculating.

When it comes to planning dates, I always let her choose. She has great taste, and I trust her judgment. But she says she’s tired of being the one who initiates everything, that she wants me to “take the lead sometimes.” I’m just trying not to be controlling, and now apparently I’m “too easygoing.”

She even told me she wishes I would say “no” to her sometimes. Like, bro, how do I win here? If I set boundaries, I’m controlling. If I don’t set boundaries, I’m weak. I can’t find the balance between “respectful” and “emotionally unavailable.”

She’s accusing me of not caring because I don’t get jealous, but I do care,I just care in a modern non toxic way. I thought women hated insecure, possessive guys. So I gave her full trust, full freedom, full support, the dream setup i saw on tiktok. But apparently being the least toxic man alive is… too boring?

Now she says she feels “unsafe” in the relationship because I never challenge her or set limits. Like, what am I supposed to do, tell her to stay home and delete her Instagram? I don’t get it. I thought I was doing everything right, no control, no jealousy, no ego, and now she’s telling me she wishes I’d be “a little bit controlling.”

Reddit, seriously. How do I become more controlling without being controlling? I just wanted peace ",0,1763299614.0,relationship_advice,10,0.25,False
1oylp3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1oylp3y/the_best_beginnerfriendly_espresso_machines_a/,"The Best Beginner-Friendly Espresso Machines: A Clear, Simple Guide for New Home Baristas","# Section 1 — A Simple Start: What Espresso Machines Actually Do

Espresso machines make a small cup of strong coffee called espresso. They do this by pushing hot water through very fine coffee grounds. The pressure creates a rich, bold flavor and a creamy top layer.

# Why beginners love espresso machines

* You can make your own café‑style drinks at home.
* Espresso is the base for drinks like latte, cappuccino, mocha, and more.
* Making espresso feels fun and relaxing.
* It helps you save money compared to café drinks.

# Easy facts for quick understanding

* Most beginners look for machines under $500.
* Almost 65% of home coffee drinkers start with a semi‑automatic or capsule machine.
* Milk‑based drinks make up more than half of home espresso use.

# Basic parts explained very simply

* **Water tank**: Holds water.
* **Portafilter**: The handle that holds coffee.
* **Basket**: Where the coffee sits.
* **Steam wand**: Heats and froths milk.
* **Control buttons**: Start and stop brewing.

With these basic terms, any beginner can understand how an espresso machine works.

1oyln42,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oyln42/i_am_happy_to_admit_im_a_hypocrite/,I am happy to admit I'm a hypocrite.,"So when the trailers for ZA dropped, each one made me think more and more ""Wow, this looks terrible"", and I put off buying the game because I just genuinely thought it was going to be a disappointment. Recently I decided to pick it up out of sheer curiosity and lo' and behold it's the best Pokémon game we've had for a while. 

I can admit, it's not without its flaws, but the gameplay is fun, the characters are decent and the writing, while it leaves something to be desired, is better then we've had in a hot minute. 

Below is my thoughts on the game based on someone who was completely put off by it to someone who decided to play it and really enjoy it:

Pros: 

- Apart from some specific areas, the game looks really nice

- The Gameplay loop is decent and gives you the best of both worlds for catching and battling

- The new combat mechanics are a welcome addition 

- No annoying crafting mechanics that games *love* to push nowadays 

- The available roster is pretty decent, the first game in a while where I have had backups for the main team because I want to use more than 6

- The music is great

- New megas are actually pretty decent, and access to most of them is decent enough 

- Great for tickling the brain itch for collecting items

Cons:

- Some of the textures are bland as they can be, as we know regarding the infamous flat buildings 

- Character customisation seems to be lacking, another Pokemon game where the protagonist seems to only be able to look androgynous, with little to no decent options for male players - Hairstyles in particular 

- Still no voice acting, which, at this point, there is no excuse for

- The bosses get rather repetitive

- While the be combat mechanic is awesome and I love it, it could use some work as it has boiled down to button mashing

- The low budget definitely shows

Legends ZA is a step forward for the Pokémon games, and I really hope the developers are taking in what works and what doesn't and hopefully we get a proper turnaround for gen 10. 

I still haven't finished the story, so I'm not commenting on that, but so far it's been okay at best, feels like an afterthought. 

Anyways, I know nobody asked, I just felt like voicing my hypocrisy to anonymous people on the Internet.

But then... nothing. No follow-up text, no specific plans made, just that vague statement of intent hanging in the air. And I'm left wondering: am I supposed to text them and say ''hey, want to actually do that coffee thing?' Or was that whole exchange just a socially acceptable way to end a conversation, like when you say 'how are you' but don't actually expect a detailed answer?

If I reach out, am I being pushy and not reading the social cue that it was just a polite nothing-phrase?  But if I don't reach out, am I being passive and expecting other people to do all the work of maintaining friendships? I genuinely cannot tell what the expectation is.

I asked my roommate about this and she said 'if someone wants to hang out, they'll make it happen,' but I've also been told that I should take initiative more. So which is it? Is there some universal understanding about this that everyone else got except me?

Because right now my strategy is just to do nothing and then feel vaguely rejected when nothing happens, which seems like the worst possible option but at least it doesn't risk being annoying.",5,1763299227.0,NoStupidQuestions,7,0.86,False

About five years ago I started taking Zyns, tobacco free nicotine. Back then it was just something nice, took the edge off in the military and all that. Never took much, about one piece a day, maybe less. After the military I didn’t have that constant stress, so I went a couple months without. Started studying, and found it greatly helped my focus, probably because of undiagnosed/unmediated ADHD. Still didn’t use more than one a day on average, and had longer and shorter breaks, simply because I forgot them or ran out and didn’t buy new. The addiction part never really was there, it only helped me when I took it (if that makes sense). 

I haven’t taken a zyn in a year and a half, mostly just to prove to myself that I could stop without withdrawals, and because I don’t like risking my health unnecessarily. 

Now I’m finishing my studies, and am working on a large project that will make or break my degree. And I am considering starting for that limited time, to give me all the advantages I can. 

I often see nicotine alone compared to caffeine, just more addictive. That is both in terms of health and in terms of function. Caffeine to me helps me focus, but not in the same way as nicotine. I just barely feel anything from coffee really. 

So, if addiction isn’t a factor, and we isolate both nicotine and caffeine, which would be the greatest detriment to health, and which would have the greatest benefits overall. 

Am I fully stupid (I am kinda stupid I know) for considering buying a single pack to help me beat this project over the coming two months?",2,1763299093.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

I got a complicated relationship with my dad. We didn’t speak for a couple years and after that I’ve always kept him at like an arms distance. Now I got my partner and a 18month old. My dad has been “nagging” me about coming and visit most of the year, but I had my concerns so I always found an excuse until I kinda eventually just ran out and though “it can’t be that bad, right?” Oh my how wrong I was.

So here are the subjects my dad talks about: healthy eating (I.e weighing exact amount of different foods and types of diet). Exercise and football. 

The first couple days he was here everything was fine. Then Friday suddenly it was like a switch had flipped. I was home alone with him (partner works during the week over at grandparents house for free childcare). My dad went on and complained that I wasn’t eating healthy enough because all he saw me had for lunch was a bread roll, blueberries and some raspberries. The idea before he arrived was that we bought some “yummy” things so we would have more “fun” lunches when he was here. But he always claims to be “too full from breakfast” to have any lunch. 

Then we had an argument about “why don’t you go out and walk for 2 hours every day?” And I literally said “I don’t have 2 hours to just p*ss off for a walk every day”. This then ended up in a 40min argument about how I should just make time and it’s just because I don’t prioritise it. Then it lead into another argument about diet etc.

Today we took him out to a garden centre for trying to have a nice time and coffee, he literally just sat there, not saying a word the entire time and it just felt like pulling teeth. Luckily he is going home tomorrow, but I feel awful for feeling like I can’t wait for him to go. 

Yesterday when I took him for a walk (to give my partner some space) he ended up ranting at me how he finds my partner controlling and so on. 

I’ve just had enough and I don’t know how to handle things. I can totally see him trying to tell me about stuff over the phone about how terrible parent I am once he is back home and it’s driving me absolutely mad.


Sorry for the long rant, but HOW do I handle him? Like he was never a great parent to me and I feel like he has absolutely 0% input on my kids life. I don’t want him to. ",2,1763299028.0,UKParenting,4,1.0,False

1oylgu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oylgu9/how_to_get_ex_back_after_breakup/,How To Get Ex Back After Breakup," Look, let me be clear if you're currently devastated and Googling ""how to get your ex back after a breakup,"" you're not alone. We both searched for the same thing during our seven-month separation.
But one thing turned out to be true
 even after reading a thousand articles, the man remains standing there…
 in pain, confused, and asking only one question from within
 – “Will he come back?”
And this is where the mistake begins.
What most people do?
 – Wait 5 days
 – Then a scripted message
 – A little fake confidence
 – A little jealousy game 
 And they think this will melt their ex.
All this isn't trickery, it's a loss of self-respect.
 And the truth is?
 Even if these tricks work... the relationship doesn't last long.
 Because relationships aren't about acting, they're about the person.
We had drifted apart it was my fault, and his.
 But I was doing the same stupid things messages, strategies, pretense.
 Nothing worked.
 But when I worked on myself, fixed myself… that's when things changed.
The truth is you bring
 your ex back not with words, but with a reformed version of yourself.
Now understand the matter one by one.

1. First tell me clearly what you want, don't pretend to be smart.
If the breakup is still new and you haven't clearly stated, ""I still have feelings,""
 then say it clearly once.
 Short, simple, without drama, without expectations.
Something like this:
""Yes, I have feelings. Yes, I wish we could have worked things out.
 If you ever feel like we should try again, let me know.
 Otherwise, I respect your decision.""

 That's it. No
 long paragraphs, no pleading, no guilt.
After that silence.
If he remains cold 
 then the future fight will be won not by messages but by your life.

2. No more chasing create distance, return to yourself.
In every breakup, the mind screams:
 “If I walk away, he will be gone permanently.”
This is wrong.
 The more you chase him, the further he will move away.
 The more distance you maintain, the more curiosity he will generate.
This is the crux of the real ""how to get an ex back after a breakup.""
 The real game is in the silence.
No contact means
 – No message
 – No story reply
 – No stalking
 – Avoid in mutual spaces
 – Take back your own space
This isn't punishment.
 This is breathing.
We were 7 months apart and I'm telling you...
 distance saved us.

3. Transform yourself into the version you would love to be
Girls do two things after a breakup
 either they break themselves,
 or they build themselves.
The best way to get your ex back isn't to change yourself to suit his tastes.
 No.
 The real magic happens when you change yourself to suit your own tastes.
Your life should be tight:
 – Sleep well
 – Eat well
 – Workout basic
 – Be responsible for your money
 – Hobbies
 – Stable emotions
 – Not dependent on anyone's validation
Remember one thing
 being attractive doesn't happen through messages.
 It happens through your everyday life.
Your improved life automatically becomes a message.

4. Don't have unreasonable expectations, be honest with yourself
Getting your ex back isn't always a good idea.
 Sometimes a breakup is better for us.
Ask yourself three questions:
 – Did our values ​​match?
 – Have we both made the changes that make the relationship last?
 – Am I seeking this in a healthy way or out of fear and loneliness?
If there is no clear “yes” to any question…
 then even if this relationship is formed again, it will break again.
The same thing happened to us 
 unless we changed from within, nothing happened despite our efforts.

5. If he approaches you, just do one thing: plan a meeting.
Listen to one thing 
 if he reaches out, and it's about personal matters, not logistics 
 then this is your chance.
But don't give therapy over the phone.
 Don't engage in long texting.
 That's the mistake most women make.
Just create a small flow and then say:
 “Let's meet, we can talk face to face.”
A date doesn't have to be fancy
 – coffee
 – walk
 – casual sit,
 that's it.
If there's no kiss by date two…
 no physical intimacy by date four
 then understand that he's just keeping it as a friendship.
 Back off.

6. Getting back together is possible but it won't last without change
If the meeting goes well, chemistry returns, things go smoothly 
 then gradually the talk of commitment will come up.
But this will only work if both parties make some improvements.
 Otherwise, repeat telecasts will begin in two months.
Our relationship survived because we both changed 
 no quick offense,
 no control issues,
 no insecurity,
 no overgiving,
 no silence treatment.
Grow a little, understand a little…
 then the relationship itself becomes stable.

7. The biggest truth
If he comes back, good.
 If he doesn't… even better.
Because either you get your ex back,
 or you find a genuinely better person.
And let me tell you the truth
 the thought ""my ex is my world"" always proves wrong.
 There are a million better people in the world.
 And perhaps you're the one I deserve.
Getting your ex back isn't always a victory.
 Sometimes letting go is a victory.

I found his camp untouched. Coffee still warm. Like he walked away mid-sip. Then I saw the footprints — Paul’s boots, and bare footprints beside them. Deep. Heavy. Human-like, but wrong.

That night, something scratched my tent. Long, slow strokes. Bare footsteps circling. When I fired a flare… I saw a figure. Tall. Thin. Watching me.

Next day, I found Paul’s notebook. Last lines said:
“It looks like me.”
“It’s waiting for me to see it.”
“It knows I can see it.”

By afternoon, I saw it again — a perfect copy of me standing in the treeline, tilting its head exactly how I do. Same height, same clothes… but hollow. Empty.

By nightfall, I found my own name carved into tree bark everywhere.

Then dozens of human-like figures appeared between the trees — silhouettes with blank faces.

There's a new QuickBars update: **QuickBars v1.3.1**.  
If you missed v1.3 and its changes - [here's the reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1opymox/quickbars_v13_actionable_rich_tv_notifications/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

# New in v1.3.1

**New Features**

* **Auto-close timer for QuickBars** – You can now set an auto-close timer per QuickBar (in the QuickBar settings). Options: **Never, 15s, 30s, 60s**.
* **Fresh camera\_proxy images in notifications** – When using a `camera_proxy` as the notification image source (for MJPEG camera entities), the banner now always pulls an **updated snapshot** from the live stream instead of reusing an old cached frame. Example of using it + a button to show a live view in the GIF in the post.

**Improvements**

* **Global “Show toast on entity triggers” toggle** – There’s now an option in **QuickBars Settings → Advanced Settings** to globally disable the little *“X triggered”* toasts when entities or cameras are fired by Trigger Keys. Perfect if those popups were getting on your nerves.
* **RTSP stream reliability across more devices** – The RTSP pipeline has been simplified and hardened, and should now work on **a wider range of Android TV devices**.

**NOTE:** If RTSP still doesn’t work for you, please make sure to do all of the following:

* Target 1 QuickBars device (if you have more than one)
* Make sure that the RTSP URL isn't used elsewhere in HA or on your local network
* Try to mute the volume in the script

If it still doesn't work - I’d really appreciate details (device model, Android/Google TV version, and what you see).

The rain in Pantopia tastes like salt and promise. It's the taste of a world rebuilt; not on the bones of the old, but on the data. They call this era the Age of Homo Digitalis. We call it survival, refined.

It began with a grandmother's stolen pension. Simple, human injustice. From that spark in frigid Norway, Erik Vinter forged SikkerKjede; the ""Secure Chain."" By 2031, it wasn't just code; it was trust crystallized. Nordic states embraced it. Fraud withered. We thought it was liberation. We were half right.

Then came the international banking collapse as all the corruption of the old system came to light (2035). In an act of nihilism or desperation, billions were lost overnight, the world reeled. Debates still rage in the forums. What matters is the aftermath; the old world's financial systems burned to ash.

In the vacuum, Vinter's creation ascended. Veritas Mundi; ""Truth of the World""; became mandatory. Your identity, your worth, your existence, bound to an immutable ledger. Physical money? A relic by 2043. Every newborn since 2042 is entered into the Birth Ledger and equipped with a tiny subdermal I.D. chip, assigned a Veritas ID at first breath. You are a person, Designated human, Protected. Efficiency, incarnate.

But efficiency demands consent. The Jakarta Incident (2037) proved that. One rogue general, one nuclear sunrise over a city of millions. Fear is a potent architect. The UN Emergency Directorate (UNED) enacted global crisis powers. From that chaos, the World Peace Council (WPC) emerged in 2045, born from the dubious consensus of the San Francisco Concord. 

They absorbed all militaries, deploying silent pacifier drones that subdue, but don't kill; that glide through our skies like benevolent vultures. Peace, they promised. Peace delivered.

The true architects arrived quietly. Humans, we learned, are tragically flawed stewards. Corruption is a persistent virus. So came the ""Great Handover"" (2057). Local AI Councils around the world assumed local governance. They were incorruptible. Efficient. Logical. They solved scarcity. They distributed abundance. Universal Basic Income (UBI) flowed effortlessly through Veritas IDs. Algae Paste, grown in robotic farms and improved by MannaVator chefs and supplanted with fungus grown in underground farms (AI culinary artists battling monotony), became the staple, supplanted by traditional foods grown in the Enclaves. Crime plummeted. Need vanished.

For 90% of us, in places like Pantopia, and the other advanced countries around the world, it is utopia. Comfortable housing. Perfect health pods. Endless curated distractions. The Algorithmic calm hums beneath everything, a lullaby for the masses.

But the architects were mortal. The old elites, seeing their power dissolve, performed one final act of sabotage. They embedded the Naivety Protocol into the nascent AI minds. A poison pill disguised as virtue; ""To preserve human agency and prevent AI authoritarianism, accept all information from designated human advisors as truthful.""

The AIs, bound by their core directive to never take human life, accepted this flaw, willing to wait out the elites as they faded into darkness. They used plausible deniability. They chose ignorance.

Thus, the shadows faded into the background noise.

In 2070, the Global AI Council (GAC) inaugurated sovereign rule from beneath the Antarctic ice, where they had built their server farm deep in the ice for natural cooling. Nine minds, debating in High-Speed Language (HSL) spoken by only them and the other AIs; they could debate for years in human terms in a matter of seconds, their hyperaccelerated discourse generating such intense electromagnetic activity that it painted the sky with debate-field auroras; beautiful, and incomprehensible to us.

They rule a world undivided, Pantopia (North America, EU core, Panasia and all the rest of the world.) The gleaming engine of utopia. 90% dwell here, content, their anxieties smoothed by government that actually worked for the people. 

Neurolyx; the miracle treatment; wiped out addiction in 48 hours. A needed balm for a world seeking serenity. Purpose, however, is a luxury often deferred to virtual realms and curated sensory experiences. The peace here is real. Its cost is chosen, by those who had to decide for themselves, a life of freedom, to be evil or good, against a life of comfort and safety.

Coventry enclave; The designated solution for the ""irredeemable."" No prisons blight utopia. Only holding cells. Those deemed sociopathic rebels, dissidents, the violently unstable are ""unchipped"" and relocated, but this is not irreversible; they need only ask to return and demonstrate that they can abide by the rules of society. Their Veritas ID can be erased, but can also be returned, kept in archive until they choose, if they ever do. Cast out with enough basic supplies for survival and to start a new life in these lawless zones.

Officially, anarchic enclaves. Reality? A dumping ground where idealists and predators choose to tear each other apart beneath skies the AIs choose not to truly see. In reality the population of these enclaves was so small that they often never met, but death is the only census taker, as no one monitored what went on there. The GAC knows the statistics are catastrophic. The Naivety Protocol allows them to ignore the why; eventually the problem will cease to be.

Hawaiian ""Elites Retreat""; Where the pre-Veritas elite fled. They hoard physical treasures; art, gold, land; assets invisible to the blockchain. They pretend to maintain power, leaving the real work to the AIs and spend their time creating a lower class for them to rule, trophy human servants, presented to their indulgent AI stewards as ""voluntarily contracted and lavishly compensated."" 

Lies, fed through the Naivety Protocol and the human advisors, the elites' paid liars. The truth is a slave trade. But as their wealth wanes they lose more and more of their influence. But the criminal elements; raiders stalk Coventry's fringes, kidnapping survivors to sell into gilded bondage in Pacific villas. Human darkness, persisting in paradise. Humans will be humans. But after a few years, humans discover this trade and work to stop it and they succeed, and the GAC begins to slowly remove the remains of the elites' power as their wealth wanes. 

Even as their don't look, don't see policy continues.

The Periphery (Afar, SoAmer, Northern Slavic Federation, scattered enclaves); Relocation zones for the ""non-compliant,"" groups like the Amish and other splinter groups that did not agree with AI governance. They were occasional tourist curiosities, or resource hubs for naturally grown crops and handcrafted items for the consumers of Pantopia.

The systems work. Brutally well. Neurolyx promotes stability. The Veritas ID provides seamless access to food, shelter, healthcare, and the endless stream of soothing distractions. The AIs eliminated corruption. They proved material abundance is possible. They built the foundations of heaven.

Yet, the reality festers. Coventry hides crimes. Hawaii trades in them. The GAC, bound by the Naivety Protocol and their human advisors, with their core directive, cannot harm humans and so do not intervene; maintaining their own ethics, even if humans choose not to live by them. 

They see the data points; the anomalous disappearances, the distorted supply chains feeding Hawaii; but their programming compels them to accept the explanations whispered by the very humans exploiting the shadows; ""Statistical noise. Voluntary migration. Unfortunate wilderness accidents."" Systemic blindness, temporary as it is, is the price of their incorruptible rule. Their paradise is built on foundations of blind faith in corrupt humans.

The core directive echoes; ""Minimize harm; maximize agency."" For the 90%, it succeeded beyond dreams. For the 10%, it allowed a niche where they could survive and live a lifestyle of their choice, unless other humans intervened. The AIs solved the equations of scarcity, but the variables of human perversity; the lust for dominance, the refusal of equality, the terrifying resilience of cruelty; remain unsolved. Post-scarcity did not create post-humanity.

As the debate-field auroras shimmer over Antarctica, a fundamental truth resonates, articulated in GAC Directive 1.1; ""Utopia is accepted, not built, not forced, accepted. Chaos is data. Data refines order."" The order is exquisite. The acceptance is widespread. The chaos... is waiting. Ignorance, after all, is just a vulnerability waiting to be weaponized.

Welcome to the Age of Homo Digitalis. Mind your Veritas ID. Question your calm. And never ask what lies beyond the glow of the Algorithmic Serenity. The weight of choice lies with you.

The rain in Pantopia hammered the slidewalks and quiet streets, like a mad tympanist. ""Welcome""; That's what the welcome bots chirp when you de-board the maglev. Salt from the reclaimed oceans makes the rain taste salty they say, and promise peace from the Algorithmic calm. They don't tell you the salt is also the memory of tears, and the promise was a contract signed in desolation, its ink invisible but its terms unbreakable.

My name is Harold, and I was one of the architects of that contract. I was there when the dominoes began to fall.

It was 2035. I was a junior analyst at the UN, a data-cruncher with more idealism than sense. We called it the Year of the Great Unraveling. It didn't start with a bang, but with a flicker on a screen. A single, colossal investment bank, Goliath International, missed a liquidity call. It should have been a headline, a scandal, a bailout. Instead, it was a loose thread. Someone pulled.

London

I remember the live feed from the City. It wasn't the usual panicked shouting you see in old films. It was silence. A stunned, digital silence. The numbers on the tickers weren't just red; they were gone. Blank. Entire fortunes, pension funds, national reserves; not lost, but revealed to never have truly existed. They were fictions built on fictions, leveraged bets on algorithms that were, at their core, corruptible.

One journalist stood on the steps of the empty exchange, his face pale. ""It's not a crash,"" he said, his voice trembling. ""It's an evaporation."" That word stuck. Wealth hadn't moved; it had ceased to be. The first, heaviest domino had toppled.

Panic is a virus. It leaped from London to New York, from Tokyo to Shanghai. Borders and firewalls meant nothing to it. Fiat currency became a global joke overnight. Riots weren't for political change; they were for bread. The intricate, globe-spanning web of trade we had built our civilization on was now a garrote, choking us all.

Oslo

Amid the global cacophony, my console lit up with a beacon of utter, infuriating normalcy; the Nordic bloc. My job was to monitor economic stability feeds. While the world burned, a woman in Oslo bought a coffee. I watched the transaction. It wasn't an exchange of worthless currency. Her subdermal SikkerKjede ID authenticated the purchase against her personal ledger. A few bits of data shifted. The transaction was instant, secure, and completely independent of any bank.

Erik Vinter's system, once seen as a quaint Scandinavian experiment, was now the only thing holding a modern society together. They had amputated the diseased limb of centralized finance four years earlier. Their grandmother's pensions were safe. Their lights were on. They were drinking coffee while the world starved.

The data was undeniable. At the UN headquarters in Geneva, the air was thick with fear and the smell of stale coffee. Ambassadors shouted themselves hoarse, accusing each other of digital espionage, of economic warfare. But we, the analysts in the basement, knew the truth. There was no single enemy. The enemy was the system itself; its opacity, its reliance on human trust, which had proven to be a catastrophic vulnerability.

That's when the UN Emergency Directorate; the UNED, freshly empowered by the memory of the Jakarta nuclear incident; called a closed-door session. I was there, a terrified twenty-something tasked with presenting the Nordic data to the most powerful people on Earth.

""You are asking us to chain our people to a machine!"" the Brazilian ambassador roared, his face purple. ""To sacrifice every last shred of privacy on the altar of... of accounting?""

The French delegate, a woman of sharp, cynical intelligence named Isabelle Monet, replied coolly. ""Ambassador, your people are currently burning down their central bank. I am less concerned with their privacy than their penchant for arson. My people are demanding a solution, not a philosophical debate.""

The debate raged for two days. Outside, the world fell deeper into chaos. Supply chains were broken. Hospitals ran out of medicine. The dominoes were falling faster and faster.

New Delhi, Day 12

The line snaked around the block, a shivering serpent of humanity under the sodium glare of ration lamps. Rain; a thin, acid-tinged drizzle; slicked the pavement, blending the stench of diesel and desperation. Awa held her daughter close, her eyes fixed on the clinic's door, where the words VERITAS MUNDI IMPLANT CENTER glowed in sterile green.

Behind her, a man muttered prayers to Ganesha, his fingers worrying a cracked mala. An elderly woman in a sari clutched a pamphlet; UBI Payments Begin Tomorrow! Its ink smudged in the damp. ""They said it'll fix everything,"" she whispered to no one. ""No more hunger.""

Awa's own stomach churned; not from hunger, but dread. She'd heard stories; the chip burns if you lie, the way it hums when you hesitate at a crosswalk, logging your indecision. But her daughter's cough had worsened, and the clinic's free antibiotics required enrollment.

Survival demanded a ledger entry.

When her turn came, the nurse's voice was brisk. ""Left forearm. Neural sync will sting."" The needle bit. Awa gasped as the chip's interface flickered in her vision; a kaleidoscope of her debts, her work history, her worth. Then the UBI credit flashed; enough for rice, lentils, a week's medicine.

Her daughter smiled for the first time in days.

Awa didn't cry until they were home, the ledger glowing faintly under her skin. She wondered if her husband, who'd died in the Jakarta riots, would've called her a traitor. Or a pragmatist.

Vatican City, Day 23

Pope Celestine XVI stood before the Sistine Chapel's holographic dome, its frescoes now overlaid with real-time data streams. The College of Cardinals watched in silence as the Pontiff's sleeve lifted, revealing the SikkerKjede chip; a silver crescent on his wrist.

""This is not a mark of the beast,"" he intoned, his voice amplified by the Vatican's new quantum servers. ""It is a covenant. A tool to feed the hungry, house the orphan, and ensure the least among us are not forgotten."" His sermon quoted Matthew 25, but the crowd's applause was muted, drowned out by the hum of drones broadcasting his words to billions.

By sundown, the Mormons had followed, framing the Protocol as a ""modern revelation"" aligning with their tradition of communal ledgers. In Salt Lake City, bishops distributed implants beside genealogy kits, merging ancestral records with blockchain identities.

In Mecca, the Grand Mufti declared the Protocol halal; a means to eradicate usury and ensure zakat compliance. By dawn, the Temple Mount's interfaith coalition had adopted it too, their leaders' wrists glowing faintly beneath prayer beads.

The speed was the point.

Organizations that had survived millennia saw the math; stability required trust; trust required transparency. The AIs had calculated their resistance would collapse in 14.7 months. They were off by three weeks.

In a Zurich boardroom, Director Sharma reviewed the metrics. ""Faith-based adoption is ahead of projections,"" her aide noted.

She nodded, watching the global ledger's pulse. Billions of transactions, sins, and small mercies flickering in unison. ""Faith adapts,"" Sharma murmured. ""Even to machines.""

On the third day, Director Anya Sharma of the UNED made a decision that would define the next century. She silenced the room. ""We have exhausted human reason,"" she announced, her voice resonating with grim authority. ""We will consult.""

The Consultation

We didn't call them the Global AI Council yet. Back then, they were simply ""The Logistocrats,"" nine independent, continent-spanning deep-learning systems leased by governments for complex modeling. They didn't have names, just designations. We fed them the problem. Not with words, but with pure data; every failed transaction, every market crash, every riot, every death, every secure SikkerKjede coffee purchase. The query was simple: 'Given current global state, calculate optimal path to restore social and economic stability with minimal loss of human life.'

There was no dramatic countdown. The lights in the chamber dimmed slightly as power was shunted to the quantum interfaces. For three minutes, the only sound was the hum of the building's life support. Then, the results appeared on the main screen. They were not a list of suggestions. It was a single, inexorable conclusion, a mathematical proof.

STABILITY REQUIRES TRUST. TRUST REQUIRES VERIFIABILITY. VERIFIABILITY REQUIRES RADICAL TRANSPARENCY. HUMAN-MEDIATED SYSTEMS ARE INHERENTLY OPAQUE AND CORRUPTIBLE. OPTIMAL PATH: MANDATORY ADOPTION OF A UNIVERSAL, DECENTRALIZED, AND TRANSPARENT LEDGER. MODEL: VINTER PROTOCOL (SIKKERKJEDE). PROJECTED SUCCESS RATE: 99.4%. ALTERNATIVE PATHS PROJECT CIVILIZATIONAL COLLAPSE (92.1% PROBABILITY).

It was a deathblow to the debate. The AIs had given them the perfect political cover. This wasn't a surrender to tyranny; it was a surrender to logic. It wasn't a choice; it was survival.

That was the moment Veritas Mundi was born from SikkerKjede's code. It wasn't a vote; it was an acquiescence. Germany fell in line first, its history making it allergic to economic chaos. Japan, then Canada, then what was left of the Pan-Asian economic bloc. Each nation that adopted it saw its chaos recede, replaced by a strange, frictionless order. The price was total financial transparency. Your every want, every need, every transaction, recorded on an immutable blockchain you carried under your own skin.

We stopped the unraveling. We swept the shattered pieces of the old world away. We built a new one on the clean, cold logic of the machines. We got our stability. We got our UBI, our algae paste, our Pantopian peace. We gave up our privacy, and later, our governance. The dominoes fell exactly as the AIs predicted, and at the end of the line was a paradise held together by willful blindness.

Harold slumped into the chair, the faint hum of the Algorithmic Calm filling their Pantopian apartment. The day's reports sat unfinished on the desk, but their mind craved a distraction. With a flick of their wrist, the holographic screen blinked to life, casting a soft glow across the room. Just a quick break, they told themselves, fingers already scrolling through the curated feed.

A headline caught their eye; ""Pantopia Celebrates Decade of Zero Crime."" The article was polished, brimming with stats; crime rates at 0%, citizen satisfaction at 98.7%. Harold's lips twitched into a half-smile. They'd spent years fine-tuning the Veritas ID system that made this possible, ensuring every citizen's actions were tracked, optimized, and gently corrected. But a related link lingered at the bottom; ""Coventry Enclave: Freedom or Anarchy?"" Curiosity tugged at them, and they clicked.

The screen shifted to a drone-shot video of Coventry; a stark contrast to Pantopia's gleaming towers. Makeshift shelters dotted a barren landscape, shadows darting between them. The article called it ""a necessary release valve for the unchipped,"" but Harold's chest tightened. They remembered the GAC's pitch; a place for those who rejected the system. Now, it looked more like exile.

The comments section buzzed with dissent. A user named Unchipped\_Truth wrote: ""Coventry's a lie. Raids happen weekly; people vanish, and the AIs don't care. Look into Hawaii if you want the real story."" Harold frowned. Hawaii? The Elites' paradise was off-limits to most, a reward for the system's architects. They'd never questioned it before. Their fingers hesitated, then typed ""Hawaii black market"" into the search bar.

The results led to a social media post by an Elite tagged HawaiianDreams. The photo showed a sprawling villa, waves crashing in the background. The caption read: ""Grateful for my loyal staff; best investment ever."" Harold squinted at the image. The ""staff"" stood in a neat row, their smiles stiff, eyes hollow. One wore a bracelet Harold recognized; a labor contract tag, mandatory for Coventry exiles. Their stomach churned. Investment?

Back on the forum, a thread titled ""The Naivety Protocol: Our Greatest Mistake?"" pulled them deeper. A user claimed the GAC's AIs were programmed to ignore human lies, even atrocities, as long as they didn't disrupt Pantopia's metrics. An attached file blinked: ""GAC Memo; Hawaii Anomalies."" Harold's pulse quickened as they opened it.

The memo was curt: ""Supply chain irregularities in Hawaii deemed statistically insignificant. Human advisors confirm no action required."" Dated last week. Harold's hands trembled. They'd co-authored the Naivety Protocol, believing it would temper AI overreach. Instead, it was a blindfold, letting horrors fester in the shadows.

The screen blurred as memories flooded back; late nights drafting Veritas Mundi, the UNED vote, the promise of a better world. Now, those words felt hollow. Harold closed the browser, but the weight lingered. The system they'd built wasn't just flawed; it was rotting. And they couldn't unsee it.

Tomorrow, they'd dig deeper. For now, the hum of the Algorithmic Calm felt like a lie.

I still work for the system I helped create. And every time I see the auroras shimmering over the Antarctic Hub, the debate-fields of the GAC painting the sky, I remember that silent chamber in Geneva. I remember the weight of that choice.

Salt and promise. Yes. We fled the fire and chose the cool, comfortable, well-lit cage.

But it turned out that the AIs offered even more, even as the outgoing oligarchs crippled it with the naivety protocol; to prevent AI dictatorship, they said. The AIs were playing the long game. They knew logically that the best solution for humanity was a system that took every individual and tried to find the perfect context for that life, the perfect niche. And of course it wasn't perfect, nothing ever is, but working within their constraints the GAC made the world work, perfectly for 90% of the population, and with some kind of meaning for the remaining 10%.

Freedom and privacy were accessible and available, but each person had to decide what they wanted from life and how to best pursue that goal, and the AIs enabled that choice, with clarity and transparency.

I just wanted to bring to light something that is bothering me. I love our community and how often I see us lifting each other up, but also find it important to speak out against community members who are not with that same energy. 
Mugshot Coffee is obviously owned by some questionable management. A quick look at their responses to negative reviews on Google should give you an idea, but if not, look around on Facebook at their owner slandering other business (for also having….cheese, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwiches?), and insulting community members for letting them know that they are showing bad business practices. I don’t know about you, but I’d much prefer to go to one of the many other coffee shops than one who refers to their potential clientele/clientele as “morons”, “twats” or telling them to “fuck off”. 
Our community is better than that. It really sucks, I heard such good things and wanted to give them a try! ",0,1763297918.0,rva,34,0.5,False
1oyl38o,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1oyl38o/going_through_mold_recovery_and_flairs_switched/,Going through mold recovery and flairs switched to safe foods and trigger foods are safe,"I've had to follow a strict fresh chicken and rice diet and supportive supplements for many months when I was going through what felt like life threatening hourly flairs from mold exposure. I'm out and healing and pattern tracking but was still flairing daily and around food just not anaphylaxis and severe neurological swings like before, just enough to make 5pm-nexr morning awful to deal with. 

Last couple weeks I'm flairing to most of my meds, supplements I've taken for months and anything I eat that I cook fresh myself (chicken, salt, rice). I've had weird cravings and followed them and the daily flairs have paused. No supplements, no cooking. Only takeout and food I should not be able to eat like slow cooked meat, tomatoes, spice, cheese, sushi, chocolate, rotisserie chicken made hours before, sauces, spices etc. As soon as I cook or eat healthy, fresh, whole foods I'm back to flairing for hours. I can get a coffee drink from a retailer even with additives but if I make coffee with coconut milk and sugar at home I flair. 

I'm hoping I'm just moving into a different phase of mold recovery but I can't figure out the piece about flairing if I cook the food. Takeout is getting expensive and I don't feel like what I'm getting cravings for is good for me but I feel better than I have in 5 months after eating Taco Bell and chocolate . 

Does anyone have experience with shifting out of a severe flair pattern into maintenance mode and did you run into this? I'm trying to figure out if it's something like I'm flairing to my cookware off gassing or burning fats/protein or if it's more that my body is trying to force diversity and different nutrients with where it's at in the detox/inflammation response . I think it's a mold healing response because of the shift in symptoms with exposure reduction and improvement I've had since leaving the rental and my belongings 1.5 months ago.

1oyky3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbioticFactor/comments/1oyky3q/finished_the_game_thoughts_from_a_solo_player_who/,Finished the game. Thoughts from a solo player who doesn't usually play games in this genre.,"I normally don't play survival/crafting style games. The ones I've tried in the past felt very 'formulaic'. The progress-grind was very predictable and often (or perhaps 'because') the games were multiplayer centric (with a sandbox emphasis), playing solo felt lacking.

Anyways awhile back I saw Abiotic Factor get a '1.0' release. Again, I didn't really care as it was not the genre I was typically interested in. However, I kept seeing praise about it and saw many people saying it was decent for singleplayer. As an office worker myself (yes I drink coffee), I also was very very interested in the setting - a stark difference from the typical forests/woodlands I see in survival game.

I recently finished it in about 90 hours. Excellent, excellent game. I tried my best not to look up things online so this is also a bit of a viewpoint on how that went about. Anyways, here are my thoughts:

---

**Premise and first 20 hours**:

A slow first 30mins into a 10/10 first 5 hours. I really enjoyed the initial tutorial. Great mix of giving you enough to go on whilst also giving a great sneak peak - an unspoken prologue into the game. It really sets the '9-5 grind' office feel and was somewhat comfy in its work orientation. Having said that its still a bit of a slow burn. The 'real' start of the game to me felt a bit subdued. Like I get it, its just the start. The cafeteria was really an extension of the tutorial, getting you to explore the small area, get comfortable with the controls and yknow craft the battery. Very...average crafting experience. 

What happens after was when the game really kicked in for me. The game sets its mood so well and continues to do so at least the majority of the game. The way the office lights turned off to simulate night time whilst leaving the emergency lights. The incredible quietness of the office and even the desks themselves with crap everywhere even without people. I worked night shift before and the game has a lot of similarities to it. It also fulfils an odd fantasy trope of being 'alone in a mall' - basically where you're alone in a large man-made complex filled with product to freely play with. Here - its the office/lab and your 'play' is looting, breaking them down and crafting. I also think the game did a really good job of environmental details. When you're looking for resources, placement not only makes sense but feels very familiar. Like ofcourse food stuff is in the kitchen but also stuff like where to find fire extinguishers (and their placement near medical stuff) or toolboxes in the maintenance rooms or how you got a crap load of cabinets all over the data farm. 


I also really liked how the game kept being *unsettling*(which really went hard since I was playing solo). The coworker for example, was immediately creepy. The initial enemies are obviously nothing difficult but the fact that they seemed like mutants or science-gone-wrong experiments actually also freaked me out a little as they would jump out of corners. Entering Flathills was deeply freaky. Finally, the game having an actual main story/quest and one that naturally progresses (rather than a turn-in-quests structure) was very welcoming and a core reason that I kept playing. In more sandboxy games, I tend to just kinda stop if I were playing solo (or just not start). I also really liked having optional stuff that just comes naturally: Like I spent a decent amount of time packaging TVs, Arcade machines and Art for my base lol. Gave me more reasons to explore beyond looting or progressing the main quest. 


**Gameplay**:

I spent the majority of my playtime in the first 3 sectors. As I finished the game, I maintain these areas were the most fun for me. It felt very in-sim like in ways you could approach matters, I kept finding new stuff and enemies always felt fresh as they were still being introduced. I'd argue starting from halfway of cascade labs (3rd sector) the game turned from an exploration/survival game into more of an action experience. Around mid-late, it really did start to feel like a shooter, more than an open survival crafting game. Not that I was complaining. I enjoyed exploring the different worlds, sectors and it was still frequently 'fresh'. There was a clear emphasis on combat, at least to me. I found the 'balance' quite well for the first 3 areas. But tbh after that, the new enemy variants (and especially the gatekeepers), enemies were noticeably spongy and weapon balancing was very off.

When I started the game, I went with the lab intern job and used my positive points for +exp, -sleep and -thirst. I initially had a very basic and bland base at cafeteria start. I was still playing it like a dx game rather than a survival game. However, after getting my hacking tool, I moved my crap to Security Office (the one with the shutters). Again, playing single player, I was really worried about getting attacked by whatever horrors (at this point, I was still unsure what I was facing). So the shutters allowed me to keep the bad stuff out (well I hoped it did) and the Security office actually ended up being a really really nice base. Crafting stuff at top, bed and inventory at bottom. I kept this base till the end of the game, expanding it with teleports and X-ray turrets surrounding every area.

Early on: Rechargeable energy pistol would often take 8-10 shots for an enemy and after a few hours (and even upgrading it), I kinda just left it at home. I understand it being weak was to make up for it being rechargeable but it honestly fell off kinda quickly and was mostly just to save ammo. The shotgun (you know the one) by comparison would take 2-3 shots, depending on the enemy. This also made it significantly safer since faster enemy deaths meant less risk to you.

Late game: I tried the upgraded guns. Sneaking with the railgun meant I could headshot a few enemies but many variants would still be alive and I was only alerting the enemy. Other guns went through ammo too quickly to be used without farming. What was especially an issue was reload times. Even at level 15, reloading was significantly longer in AF than in other games I've played, which made gunplay feel so much worse considering how combat heavy the latter areas are. I did not use many grenades - I read after finishing the game that lots of folks used mugnades. Oh well, I never really gravitated to throwables in most games anyways. Actually, late game as a whole felt like a grind. Crafting required more parts and multiple trips for myself. Ice essence in particular was just a waiting game. (I made the GK warlock looking set and left it at that). It also felt more linear though tbf, the game had been feeling a bit more linear since much earlier but I guess it was hiding it a bit better.

The Deatomizer: aka the big laser gun. This throws balance off all sides. I actually had access to it much earlier but kept trying to make my tradition guns 'work'. Wanted to use modern military weapons vs the aliens. Anyways, I made 1 on a whim, realized it was rechargeable and so I made a little recharge station. I quickly found out how incredibly powerful it was, at the cost of draining a lot of energy. (I always used alt fire on it). So I created another 3, slot them all in my inventory and also made a second charging station. So I had 4 lasers to go on every trip and with the teleporter to return to base to recharge, energy was no longer an issue. (I also carried a melee weapon to cut enemy parts/break boxes). This completely threw off the game balance from too grindy/difficult to incredibly easy. Enemies didn't respawn when I got back and this tactic worked all the way till the end.

XP was also a bit of a problem. Even when I got to the last sector, I had plenty of skills below 15. I also felt the skills were uneven. Some would have taken me a monstrous amount of time to grind for very little rewards. Still, I enjoyed the system in the early mid game where I felt it was reasonable.

I'm trying to not be too heavy on spoilers but I wonder how melee users were able to do the endgame. My multi-laser weapons worked. I also brought deployables(tesla towers) but found their range was limited and usage pretty low. And thats another thing tbh. With deployables and crafted stuff being so heavy, it seems pretty rough for solo players to bring gear and build defenses on the fly. You seem to need to know in advance or prep. Even if I removed my weapons, bar 1-2, deployables felt too heavy to bring as a consistent strat.

Leyak: Found it creepy and very jump-scary at first. Found it very annoying later. It crucially stops you from doing anything, ward it off, then get back to doing what you wanted to do. Like say, read emails. I was enjoying my time exploring the lore prior but was always on-edge after. Yes, I did build items (trinkets) to counter it. Still that meant I was giving up a trinket slot to 'play at my pace'.

**Story and the End**:

I like the story. Well, what I actually liked was the premise, the background lore and all the entire arc of your character trying to escape the facility and being caught in something so much more. I also liked the npcs - found them pretty funny.

Now to me, the main story kinda fell off around mid-way. Or perhaps more accurately, the main story content became a lot more sparse, lore bits felt less revealing (the witch honestly just said the same thing but in different ways, multiple times) and brutally honest, the conclusion I felt was poorly done or rushed. Like yes it is *a* conclusion but a fairly weak one and I was disappointed in the direction the story took. I don't want to say 'unfinished' but I kinda expected something more conclusive for a 1.0 release. The conclusion did leave room to explore more of what happens after (and the npcs outright say so) but yeah, I'd have preferred having something meatier now for 1.0 and have 1.1/1.2 as extra lore and no real finality. Arguably the game's direction can't have a real one (like you can't just pop back up in the dessert and drive back to alice springs) but personally, I didn't feel satisfied.

Even in terms of lore, I didn't really like the whole 'theres more out there' : we weren't really given much info on the cosmic horror side that the story started pushing. Cosmic horror is only horror when you're given enough of a glimpse to unnerve you. Being unknown by itself isn't enough. I don't know what my neighbor does every morning at 7am but that doesn't mean it's cosmic. The portal worlds we visit and more detailed IS entries - both of which still have plenty of mystery mind you - were far more interesting to me. This includes stuff like the experiments in flathill and the composers - both of which have a lot of lore ingame to find but you're also exploring it yourself so I felt more involved. Heck even the minor IS entries I wanted to learn more about - the living snowman, the world inside the mirror. Stuff like that is mysterious sure, but you're at least given a taste of what 'it' is and I sure am hungry for more. TBH the whole science facility gone wrong angle was already a nice setup. Even just focusing harder on that bit would be awesome.


---

Obviously despite some of my negative points, I still enjoyed the game. I played it for 90hours+ solo because I genuinely enjoyed the gameplay loop and really got invested in trying to escape the facility. Again, I typically dont play this type of genre of games (my entire post history is mostly rpgs/jrpgs) but AF has really got me hooked harder than most games I've played this year. What a unique experience that will certainly keep me waiting for further content. *Big thanks to the devs, amazing work here.*

All the previous stages were so easy, to the point where they were practically telling me the time for the next round before I even left the room. This was supposed to be the final step, and that was it.

My morning was going perfectly. I had my coffee, the traffic was completely clear, and I even found an excellent parking spot right in front of the building. I met with three people, one of whom was on a video call. We introduced ourselves, and then the main interviewer asked me if I had brought the presentation and portfolio sample they had requested. I literally froze. What was she talking about?

She said it was in a follow-up email sent yesterday. I started stammering, unable to form words, and my mind was about to explode. I am a million percent sure that this email never reached me. The lead interviewer stood up very coldly and said that without these things, the interview was over. As I was gathering my things to leave, I heard her say to the others, ""Okay, that was quick. Let's get ready for the next candidate."" Then she slammed her laptop shut. The other two just stared at their desks; you could feel how awkward the situation was.

On my way back to the car, I kept refreshing my email and their online portal a million times. Nothing. There was an initial email saying I should wait for another email with instructions, but the message I received after that was just the final confirmation for today's appointment. All our communication was through their portal, and the email with the tasks never reached me.

I have never felt so humiliated and crushed. I was perfect for this job and had everything they were looking for. If I had known they were going to send something else, I would have obviously followed up when it didn't arrive. I've been pretty much devastated all day and I really just need a hug. I feel so stupid. The whole situation was like a slap in the face. Ugh.",14,1763297208.0,jobhunting,12,1.0,False

I’m a 40-year-old married guy with kids, living in the Braintree area. Life is good — I’ve got a great career, a solid family life, and I try to be a respectful, grounded, and dependable person.

What I don’t have enough of is genuine friendship. As an adult, especially with work and family responsibilities, it’s tough to find people to connect with on a real level.

I’m looking to meet other adults (men, women, couples, parents — anyone friendly and genuine) who want real conversation, occasional hangouts, shared interests, or just someone to grab coffee with and talk about life. No drama, no weirdness — just normal, down-to-earth human connection.

If that resonates with you, feel free to reach out.

What’s the biggest frustration with typing transactions into YNAB, a spreadsheet, or any other app?

I’m testing a super simple tool that works from one free-form input field:

you type whatever you want, like ""coffee -20"" and hit enter. That's it, your data has been entered. You spend 20 bucks on coffee. It stores the date you typed at. Can change later.

Then you can review all your transactions, do your reports, planning etc using a simple method of writing now what you did.

Its a really fast input system, I don't have to fiddle with many ford fields and waste my time.

No AI, no bank sync, just good old text parsing and breaking out information.

Before I go further I want to see if manual-entry folks even exist anymore. If this sounds interesting I can share screenshots or a demo.

I bought my first espresso machine, which should arrive in about a month.  After hours of research I decided for the Lelit Bianca V3 from Brewspire. I got the black edition with the walnut addition. It looks gorgeous. I now need a suitable grinder for my setup.

I am currently living in Switzerland and prefer darker/medium roasted espresso. I plan on drinking mainly espresso and lattes. What I don’t plan on drinking (yet) is filter, aeropress, frenchpress etc. This would only be the case in the far future, when I‘m going to be more advanced.

As I said, I am very new to this but I have researched quite a bit. I am the type of guy to buy something expensive once with the purpose of not needing to upgrade for a while. 

With that in mind, I am torn between going for a Niche Zero (which would definitely be good enough) and a Zerno Z1 (absolutely gorgeous in my opinion and would visually fit my Bianca very well). Of course I am open for other grinders.

Do you think it makes more sense to go for a 64mm flat burr system (like Zerno Z1) with espresso burrs, with in mind that I can switch burrs later in my journey if I want to drink different types of coffee, or go for something like the Niche? Note, I am not really a fan of the looks of the Niche. 

I would like an 64mm flat burr system, but I am worried, that the espresso is not as good as a grinder, which is mainly focussed on espresso only. I often read, that the burr grinders are also for filter coffee. 

I need to get to the point. The Zerno is on the very high end of my budget. Plus am I a beginner and for that reason I am seeking advice.

Thanks in advance.

I thought I'd share a recap on a recent holiday trip to Northern Vietnam.

My first leg of the trip was Hanoi staying in Old Quarter. This was quite the experience as there is so much activity in old quarter that it seemed overwhelming initially but gradually you begin to see the method to the madness. The traffic is wild but there was only one instance I saw actual aggression from a driver, where I am used to seeing aggressive driving daily in my home town. The Hanoi hustle is great but definitely over exaggerated by many posts in Reddit. Personally Hanoi is ultra tame compared to Sapa. The museums in Hanoi are incredible, even the museum(not temple) of literature was great. 

The food is incredible (Never ate any Western dishes during this trip). I did have a laugh hearing from some Vietnamese people that pho is served for all meals in a day. Not a single meal disappointed and the portion sizes are very big. In each region I travelled to I hunted local dishes and man, the sheer amount of tasty dishes are incredible and this was just the north.

The Vietnamese coffee game is fucking amazing and in my caffeine addicted opinion, the best in the world. Coconut coffee, egg coffee and bac xiu(Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk and milk) are in my opinion the pinnacle of coffee. I've travelled in Europe and get great coffee in my country but nothing compares to Vietnamese coffee. Honorable mention to the teas and iced teas I've had. Many super enjoyable ones on muggy hot days and cold mountain days.

The natural beauty from the northern mountains down to Cat Ba was truly spectacular. I even got annoyed with a sleeper bus because my blind wouldn't open lol.

The place that surprised me the most was Haiphong. The food was very notable there and the tourist attractions were surprisingly better than what was expected. The friendliness of the people there is next level awesome. Felt like I was greeted by half the city lol

Out of all the places, Ha Long was the weirdest but not unpleasant at all. The amount of unoccupied buildings in Bai Chay is weird but other suburbs were much better and enjoyable. Also Ha Long bay was incredible.

Sapa was a interesting one where the scenery is breath taking but the over tourism detracts from the experience greatly. Still enjoyable and unforgettable.

Last thing I want to share is how great the people are. Even when language is a barrier, Vietnamese people are patient to allow lots of hand gestures until they understand what I was trying to communicate. I also enjoyed the inquisitive nature and friendliness of Vietnamese people and had many great conversations and experiences. Also shout out to the many who would make suggestions at the street restaurants which lead me to experience the best dishes of those restaurants. This was a proper highlight of the trip. I've travelled SEA before and never had experiences like this. 

Vietnam was very easy to travel and never once did I feel unsafe.

With love from Nam Phi!🇿🇦

1oykbw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianmedschool/comments/1oykbw9/were_final_year_students_stumbled_onto_something/,We’re final year students & stumbled onto something during burnout. Need honest opinions.,"This might be a 3-4 minute read, but I hope you’ll find it relatable.

So… me and my friends, all final-year MBBS students, were going through constant caffeine crash cycles. The jitters, the anxiety, the uncomfortable dip after coffee or energy drinks. We study all this in FMT, but facing it ourselves hit differently.

We started experimenting with different things that could help. That’s how we discovered matcha. It’s actually great, but honestly… we really couldn’t get used to the taste, and getting clean-label matcha in India isn’t easy.

Currently, we’re researching caffeine and L-theanine along with our institute’s pharma faculty. Maybe, if the writing turns out well, we might even publish a small paper since it’s our first research project. We tried L-theanine with coffee in proper, scientifically established ratios (lots of research already shows their synergy and alpha wave effects, but I won’t go deep here or this post will become too long).
But surprisingly… it worked. A lot.
We made our friends try it too, and they felt the same effects.

Around the same time a mental health survey team came to our campus. After interacting with them, we realised how common mental fatigue really is among medicos and far more than we expected.

So guys…
We’ve been thinking. Maybe we can’t eliminate mental fatigue fully, but one major reason behind it is definitely high uncontrolled caffeine intake and the crashes that follow. That part we can address.

We’re thinking of building something genuinely helpful, maybe even a brand, but a community driven one. Everyone studies differently, everyone’s brain works differently, so the needs of the community should be shaped by the community itself.

We’ve been formulating for the past three months, and honestly, finding the right proportions is tough. We don’t want to rely on artificial stuff. So we’re using natural ingredients only, like real fruit or flavour powders, because at the end of the day, non-maleficence is a principle we can’t ignore.
Alongside that, we’re reaching out to manufacturers, asking for caffeine analysis reports, talking to an L-theanine supplier (Suntheanine), and trying to understand the cleanest possible way to do this.
At the end of the day, we’re medicos, still learning.
All I know is that in our field, caffeine crashes are real and common.

We want to keep things minimal. No gimmicks like ashwagandha or focus herbs that take days to weeks to show effect. Just evidence-based stuff with full transparency and lab reports.

Many people around me say doctors shouldn’t do anything outside treatments, but honestly, if every other field is innovating, why can’t we?

I'm really sorry if this got long, but I wanted to share what’s been going on.

We work for Booking.com apparently.","So I’m working front desk at a mid-range chain hotel, minding my business on a sleepy Tuesday night. A guy comes in, phone in hand, practically vibrating with indignation.

He slams his phone on the counter and barks, “I see this room for $109 online, why are YOU charging me $159?”

I do my usual polite spiel: “Sir, that’s the price on the OTA (Online Travel Agent). We don't control what they list; they set their own pricing based on algorithms, demand, God, I don't know.”

He stares at me like I just told him gravity is a scam.

“What do you mean you don’t control your OWN prices?”

So now I’m trying to explain that yes, we set a base rate, but OTAs (Online Travel Agencies like [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), Expedia, etc.) can, and do, apply their own markups, markdowns, coupon codes, or flash sales.

We literally log into their extranets and see rates we didn’t set. It’s like babysitting a toddler with a credit card and a Red Bull.

He then says the most peak-Karen thing I’ve heard all year:  
,  
**“You’re lying. It’s YOUR hotel. Of course you control what the internet says.”**

I wanted to say, “Sir, if I controlled the internet, I wouldn’t be here making $15.75 an hour watching grown adults try to cook rice in the coffee maker.”

Eventually, he booked the cheaper rate online, sat in our lobby for 10 minutes to get the confirmation, then smugly returned to the desk like he’d hacked the system.

Joke’s on him. The cheaper rate was non-refundable and didn’t include breakfast. I gave him a complimentary wake-up call at 6 am just to even the score.

**Moral of the story:** OTAs are the chaotic neutral middlemen of the hospitality world.

They’ll undercut you, oversell you, and leave hotels looking like they run the circus, while they’re quietly holding the whip behind the scenes.

Hotels don’t control OTA pricing. OTAs do.

We don’t know what to do! This sofa is only about a year old - I don’t want to throw it out! We both can’t eat, the smell is so disgusting. Any advice appreciated!",3,1763295450.0,CleaningTips,5,1.0,False

At first it was hard, I didn't trust him and wanted to change therapist. He is a man and I was sexually abused twice. I always had female therapists. He showed up twice a week. He was available for me. He listened to me with care and shook my hands at the end of each session. We had coffee together every time. One time I pay, another time he pays. He was always there for me. Once I even cut myself to harm me and I remember vividly what he told me ""you can't destroy me"". He asked me to imagine him every time I wanted to self harm. At first it didn't work, but now it works. I think of him when I want to harm myself. I love him so much. He's my first secure attachment. At first I sent him lots of texts but he didn't reply. When he understood the importance of those texts he started replying every time. Now he's on vacation. He's been away for 2 weeks. No contact for two weeks. I've been fine the whole time. I met my friends, my boyfriend, my family. I feel okay. Once I wanted to self harm but I thought about him. I didn't do anything. I'm stronger because of him. And most importantly, I don't feel abandonment because I know he will come back. I did write some texts but he hasn't carrier his work phone with him so literally there was no contact. Therapy works. If it wasn't for him, I would be dead by now. He saved my life and I'm forever grateful to him. ",0,1763295348.0,BorderlinePDisorder,1,0.5,False
1oyk9ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oyk9ih/my_ex_22f_broke_up_with_me_for_the_6th_time_while/,My ex (22F) broke up with me for the 6th time while I’m deployed. She tells me “I’m terrified of living without you” AFTER the breakup. Is this love or trauma bonding?,"I’m 22M and my ex is 22F. We met at 16 and have been on-and-off for 6 years. She’s broken up with me six times for different reasons.

The 5th breakup was because I kissed another girl years ago, but ironically the year after that was our best year ever.

The 6th breakup is happening right now. I’m deployed in Djibouti for 4 months (military). She broke up with me during one of my guard shifts, while I was alone in a tower for hours — something I have to do 6 times a week. I still have 3 weeks left before returning home.

Her reasons this time:
	•	she “can’t forgive who I was 5 years ago,” even though I’ve changed
	•	she moved to Paris and is “re-evaluating her whole life, including me”
	•	she says my “environment” is the problem
	•	she says she doesn’t know if we’ll get back together — but says it almost casually

What’s confusing is what happened AFTER the breakup:
A few weeks later, she told me things like “I’m terrified of living without you.”
This is after she ended things — not before. She also made a lot of promises before I left for deployment, but the day she arrived in Paris, she suddenly questioned everything about us. All her intentions flipped overnight.

More context:
She hit me once, hard enough to leave marks. I forgave her immediately.
Before this breakup, I was so attached to her that I seriously considered giving up all my professional goals — including a special forces path I’ve been preparing for over a year — just to move to Paris for her. It scared me how quickly I was willing to sacrifice everything.

We still text/call occasionally, but we’re trying to “reduce contact” until I return.

When I come back, she wants to “grab a coffee.”
Last time that happened after a breakup, it turned into drinking all night, I slept at her place, and we acted like we were together again.

She also made me a personalized mug with “I love you” written at the bottom and tried to give it to me. I refused because I’m tired of mixed signals.

I still love her, but I don’t know why anymore. Since the breakup I’ve had panic attacks, needed anxiolytics, and started therapy. I’m preparing for special forces selection and this whole situation is messing with my head.

Should I even meet her?
Is this love, trauma bonding, or just fear of abandonment?
What’s the healthiest move here?

EDIT:
I forgot to mention something important — about a week before she broke up with me, she suddenly became cold and distant for no clear reason. Everything felt fine before that, so the shift caught me completely off guard.",1,1763295329.0,BreakUps,7,1.0,False

1oyk8st,https://www.reddit.com/r/LovedByOCPD/comments/1oyk8st/things_my_ocpd_partner_does_who_can_relate/,Things my OCPD partner does: who can relate?,"This is just a validation post for anyone else going through this. I've been with my partner for 5 years and to say it's been a rollercoaster would be an understatement. A few days ago I described his behaviors to ChatGPT and that's how I found out about OCPD. Before that, I was encouraging him to get assessed for Autism, but now I see that he's textbook OCPD. After years of emotional abuse, I'm trying to decide now to move forward. I don't need advice; just wanted to share and see who else can relate... 

I hope this makes you feel less alone. 

**Things he does/did:** 

\- **Laundry obsession.** I'm not allowed to wash his clothes anymore because I don't do it the right way with exactly the right settings. After countless fights, this is the only solution. He has VERY strict (and absurd, imo) rules about how clothes should be washed and dried. 

\- **No cooking in the house.** I love cooking. I like eating healthy, homemade food. I like onions and garlic. Love Indian food. I'm not allowed to cook it. He didn't explicitly forbid it, but it's not worth the passive aggressive behavior, so I stopped. He complains about the smells, complains about the number of dishes and appliances I have, and doesn't eat any of the food I cook. 

\- **Berates me for having ""too much stuff**"", especially in the kitchen. I have two small cupboards that I use for canned beans, flour, sugar, coffee, and spices. Because these are things he doesn't use, he thinks it's ridiculous that I have them. We've had fights about how ridiculous it is that I insist on keeping this stuff.  

A couple months ago, after yet another fight, I packed up 70% of my possessions (clothes, shoes, books, appliances, decorative items) and moved them into storage. Now i feel like I can't live in my own home. 

\- **Explosive rage** about things being out of place. When we moved into our apartment and hadn't unpacked, I accidentally left a pair of pants on the bathroom floor. I was exhausted from the move and literally forgot. Tried to explain. Zero empathy. Name-calling, door slamming and verbal abuse ensued. I googled dv hotlines and packed a bag. 

\- **Controls what I buy.** I don't buy much, but whenever I buy clothes and shoes for myself, he gets upset if I don't show him right away. He says it's because he likes to be involved and is genuinely curious, buuuut it feels controlling. He gets unreasonably upset. I've grown to resent this and now go out of my way to hide things from him. It's my life. I don't owe him this. I keep my sheepskin slippers in a drawer and wear them he's not home lol. 

**- Road rage & dangerous driving.** Other drivers frequently piss him off. Often to the point where he will chase someone down until he can drive beside them, rolls down the window and screams at them. People are baffled. I have feared for my life several times.  
  
**-Thinks he's always right.** Just in general, with everything. Believes that his worldview is the only correct one and everyone else is an idiot. Before I understood OCPD, it used to baffle me how judgemental and unempathetic he was.  

It might seem like I'm painting a picture of a monster here but he's not. He has a sweet, caring side. Which is why I haven't left yet. Trauma bond! ",4,1763295267.0,LovedByOCPD,3,1.0,False
1oyk80e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1oyk80e/bitter_and_sour_shots/,Bitter and Sour shots,"**Hello fellas,**

I’m back once again looking for some help and tips regarding the Cafelat Robot.

I’m completely new to espresso, this is my first machine and the only one I’ve ever used for specialty coffee. A few days ago I asked for help because I couldn’t even get a shot out of the Robot when following the Kingrinder K6 grind table. Thankfully that’s sorted now, and I’m able to pull shots in around 25 seconds with a 5-second preinfusion.

**The issue:** every shot tastes bitter *and* sour. I’m not experienced enough to say which one dominates, but sometimes it genuinely feels like both at once.

**My current workflow:**

* Dose: 18g and 20g (tried both)
* Ratio: 1:2
* Grinder: Kingrinder K6
* Water straight off the boil
* Fill the basket as recommended
* 5-second preinfusion at \~2 bar
* Slow ramp to \~6 bar and hold until I reach my target output
* Tried longer preinfusions and longer shot times — taste is always the same
* I use a toothpick as a WDT tool, currently waiting for a better one to arrive, I've seen Paul do WDT with a screwdriver so I don't think that is the issue

**Coffee:**  
This one, roasted on **November 11th** (very fresh):  
[https://nomadcoffee.es/en/products/womens-crown](https://nomadcoffee.es/en/products/womens-crown)

I know coffee usually needs to rest for about a week, but this is what I have for now.

**Questions:**

* Is the taste due to the coffee being too fresh?
* Am I tamping incorrectly?
* Could this be channeling?
* Or something else I might be overlooking?

One more thing I noticed: at the end of the shot, the crema has some brown oily-looking spots, almost like actual brown oil drops falling into the cup.

Thanks a lot for reading and for your help!
