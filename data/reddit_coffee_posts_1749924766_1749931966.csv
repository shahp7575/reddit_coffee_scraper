1lbhv41,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1lbhv41/how_to_fuel_for_long_cycle_commute/,How To Fuel For Long Cycle Commute,"Need advice for my long cycle commute. It's a 43k hilly commute, I did it for the first time on Tuesday with a fairly heavy backpack.

I was fine on the way in with just an oat bar and a coffee before setting off, but on the way home I had a real slump from glycogen depletion which I recognised from running marathons.

I can comfortably cycle 100k in one go with some gels / protein balls (oat / nut / chocolate / date mix) so I was expecting that 43k each way with an 8 hour gap wouldn't be a problem.

During the day I had a protein shake when I arrived, followed by some toast and jam, latte mid morning, baked potato with chilli for lunch and a tuna sandwich mid afternoon so I felt my nutrition during the day was pretty good too.

Any advice on what I can do to avoid the slump in the way home? Thinking maybe a Mars bar or something similar before I set off, would that help?",1,1749931785.0,cycling,0,1.0,False

I would say this represents a liminal space because, when going through life, most people study at cafés. From your teenage years, to your adult years, cozy coffee shops have been seen as a passing place of comfort and an optimal research spot for many. 

Hope you guys enjoy this liminal space! I think Tulsa (and Oklahoma in general) needs more liminal space recognition. This place feels purely transitional, yet not in a bad way. Usually, Oklahoma is a mere resting spot or a dot on the map for others. The common idea that “Oklahoma isn’t interesting” is only due to the limited tourist attractions and flat landscape. If you take a closer look, however, the state is much more than that.

I always get a drive thru (French Vanilla Latte plz). I've seen this guy now and then, but didn't think much of him, except for the fact that he looked young, handsome, kept in shape and was a ginge like me. 

Anywayyy, fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, someone with a lovely voice that I didn't recognise took my order. I drove to the window to collect my order and the aforementioned guy is standing at the window, except this time, he has become the most beautiful man I have ever seen smiling at me, friendly, saying hello, waiting for me to tap my card on the machine, because I'm in absolute awe looking at him and probably a little bit red. He passes me the drink and is all smiles wishing me a good day etc. 

It made my day. Every time I drive through now and he serves me it just makes my day because he's all smiles and I can't say much, apart from smile back at him like a goofball and try not to touch his hand whenever he hands me my drinks. I unfortunately, do not get a gay vibe from him. So I'm treating this little situation as a little pick me up. 

I told my mum and she said I should slip him a note with my number or something on it. But I am definitely not brave enough to do something like that because it will most likely come across as being creepy and don't want to harass the dude whenever he is literally just doing his job. 

So I drive away and drink my coffee in misery.

I hit a couple of awesome shots with a finer grind, but could not repeat it. The gage was spiking, too, so I was way over 9 bars.

I have a little option paralysis at this point . What would you do to get a sweeter shot with more body and avoid the sour? Maybe this coffee/roast isn’t what I need?",1,1749931517.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

* **Anime**: Currently watching The Apothecary Diaries, feels like there hasn't been much on this season. Let's chat about our favourite anime and exchange recommendations?
* **Lego**: Architecture, Star Wars and anything else that's cool to display. I may or may not be planning to have a Lego room in my next house
* **TCGs**: Pokemon and classic Digimon card collector, against my better judgment I'm thinking of getting back into Yu-Gi-Oh!
* **Archery**: I shoot at things, sometimes I hit them
* **DIY**: Bought a house 2 years ago, and might have finally run out of DIY. You get bonus points if you correctly guess how many holes the previous owners drilled for a single shelf
* **Pianist**: Occasionally the noises I make sound like anime songs
* **Reading**: I'm in my psychology/mental health/self-development/productivity phase. The Solo Leveling omnibus novel is also looking at me menacingly
* **Technology**: A general interest in computers, which ranges from gaming to building computers to home servers
* **Sci-Fi and Fantasy**: The usual culprits like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings

About me:

* White, British, 6'2"" with a slim build. Open to exchanging photos as we get to know each other
* I live in Hampshire. Open to long distance if there's potential to meet eventually and we put the effort into making it work
* Non-smoker and I don't drink. I generally prefer days out and nights in
* I'm open to having children but it'll need to be a ""hell yes"", but equally fine never having kids. My focus right now is on finding someone I'd want to spend the rest of my life with
* I'm a big texter but also up for calls and video chats when we're comfortable with each other
* Don't really have just one love language, I'm physically affectionate and a big fan of holding hands when out and about. Quality time together and words of affirmation are also ways to my heart. I express my love with a bit of everything
* I'd describe myself as quite ambitious, always striving to be better. I also (usually) know when to slow down
* Not into alcoholic, hot or fizzy drinks. So when I propose coffee and cake for our first date, just know I'll actually be drinking apple juice. Walks in the part to feed ducks and other casual activity dates also welcome. Or we can just skip to doing a couples cosplay at comic con



Thoughts on relationships:

* Smoking and drugs are dealbreakers
* I'm open to chatting with people outside the UK, but my expectations of it turning into anything serious are low. Feel free to try convince me otherwise, but you'll have to put a lot of effort in
* Communication is really important to me and something I actively want to get better at as well. Low effort first messages are unlikely to get a reply. Prove to me you've actually read my post. Conversely, high effort first messages are basically guaranteed to get us chatting
* Some shared hobbies and values are nice but I also want to know what you're into. It's expected that part of being in a relationship is doing your own thing, but spending time together on shared hobbies is nice as well
* I'm a complete person and hopefully so are you. Together, we could be more than the sum of our parts

It’s honestly one of the best cafes in Jaipur, but it was super crowded when we reached around 1:30. Totally understandable, since we hadn’t made a reservation or booked a table in advance. They told us there would be a long wait, so we decided to skip it.

We then walked over to another nearby place called House of Coffee in C Scheme. The vibe initially seemed nice, but there was a huge group of students, seemed like psychology volunteers or something and they were unbelievably loud. Like, so loud that it completely ruined the vibe. We were hoping for a peaceful afternoon, but this group made it impossible.

Still, we tried to ignore it and ordered our food. The guy taking the order said it would take around 20 minutes, which we were fine with. But we kept waiting and waiting… and waiting. Nearly an hour went by, and when we finally asked about our order, the staff seemed completely clueless. Combine that with the noisy crowd, and we’d had enough. We cancelled the order and left.

Our next (and thankfully final) stop was Roastery Coffee House, which honestly saved the day. The service was great, and we got our food within 15 minutes. But again the crowd. I don’t know what’s going on with Jaipur’s cafe culture lately, but these new 20-something crowds just talk so loudly and act all wannabe. It really kills the peaceful vibe of a cafe.

Anyway, we finally had lunch at 4:30 PM.. So yeah a very tiring Sunday

We matched on Tinder about 2 weeks ago, I messaged her about an interest we shared and asked her on a date on like the third or fourth message, very shortly afterward she asked for my number and we got to texting on Whatsapp.

She immediately agreed to going on a date, but said she had to find the time first, so we continued texting for the next 2 days and on day 3 of texting, being a bit flirty but not constantly or overly so, she finally said she had time that day and I went to pick her up. We hung out for somewhere between 6 and 7 hours, again, somewhat flirty the whole time. Went back to her place for the last 2 or 3 hours where she made me coffee, we talked a bit about our pasts and ended up making out on her couch before I left.The reasons for me leaving being that we both were constantly yawning at that point since it was 3am, her parents would be back the next morning so I couldn't stay the night and it was almost an hour drive home, so I didn't want to be any more tired.

Note that she initiated bodily contact by lightly touching my arm and leg while we were in my car and she also initiated us making out.

After I got home I texted her to say I had a lot of fun and I'd like to see her again. She said she had a lot of fun too and agreed that we should do it again soon, but that she was busy the next few days because she was going to an event with her dad and then staying over at a friends place for the extended weekend. During that extended weekend she only responded to my text once and didn't answer her phone when I called her on both days.

When she was back she started answering texts as usual and apologized for being unresponsive, still seeming pretty enthusiastic about seeing me again and we chatted about a few things, she brought up stuff that we talked about on the date and we still had pretty long conversations lasting several hours, though both of us were taking a few minutes between most responses each time.

I asked her when she was free the next time so we could see each other again but she said she was more busy than she expected and didn't know when that would be. That was fine with me, she's close to graduation and has exams coming up on top of working weekends and holidays. But when I called her later that day, she said she'd been at a waterpark with friends the whole day - again, completely fine, she's entitled to hanging out with friends obviously. The next 2 days she was home because she got pretty bad sunburn and used the time to study for her exams but we still texted on and off.

This weekend she doesn't have time either because she's camping at a lake starting today and will only be back by tuesday. She told me she'd be free starting wednesday and then the rest of the week, but not on thursday, which here in germany is a holiday, because of a family dinner. So I asked her if she'd want to lock in wednesday for our next date, but she gave a vague excuse sayig a friend asked her to hang out and she's not sure yet, but we'll definitely find a way to hang out with me that week.

We've only met that one time, none of our friends or family know each other and we haven't exchanged any social media, only numbers. I even asked her once after she was unresponsive for those 2, almost 3 days after the date if she was even interested in getting to know me better and made it clear that if she doesn't, she should just tell me so we can both move on, but she said that she really does want to, and that I don't need to worry.Seeing that she would loose out on nothing except my attention if she were to block me and move on, I can't imagine any reason for her to keep me around if she's not interested. She's a very pretty swedish girl, highly educated, funny, easy to like and get along with, all the good things. 

She doesn't need MY attention if that's the only thing she's after - she literally has over 3000 likes on Tinder right now but chose to match and go on a date with ME. A lot of those guys look better than me, are taller than me, have more money than me, or a combination of all of those - so that's not why she chose me either.

But despite all of those things pointing toward her actually liking me, she's been nothing but vague when it comes to making plans for the next date and used the ""busy"" excuse, when she was hanging out with friends that she sees every day at school to delay it at least twice now.

Her literal words say she likes me, wants to get to know me more, go on the next date, and so on. But her indirect actions by delaying or being vague tell me she doesn't. I am genuinely, very, very confused.

  
TL;DR:

Matched on Tinder, went on a date, made out. Both agree it was fun, both agree we want a second date. Now she's being vague about making plans and keeps delaying, while still saying she definitely want's a second date. Am I being used for attention, or is she actually interested - just not super high priority?",0,1749930886.0,relationship_advice,0,0.5,False

We can chat on Reddit chat first, then after a bit of time move to Discord since it's nicer and more stable. I speak only Polish and English so far, but if you know any languages I'm interested in I'll be sure to let you know!

I'm a professional programmer (not a gamedev though, that's just a hobby) but if you aren't one I won't bore you or tell you anything (unless you want to hear, lol).

I am interested in a few foreign languages (inquire within) but neglected them lately... I am always on the look out for some anime partners. I don't own a powerful PC, just a decent laptop, so I am into older or indie games mainly. 

As for anime watching: I'd do it with screenshare on Discord, and use VC or text chat to talk as we watch. In general I like to be very outspoken and active when watching with someone, not just sit there in silence (that I can do myself, lol). We can watch something you or I or both of us saw before, or something new to both of us, all variations are fun (when we both saw it or didn't, or if one of us saw it and for other it's new).

I'm not too into live action series or movies, but I do have some favorites. My favorite Polish movie is a heist one, so it'd require subs or me live translating (there isn't that much spoken dialogue really and most of it is in short lines), if you wanted to see it.

1lbhfsu,https://i.redd.it/kpmm3wfc6y6f1.jpeg,L bakery set,"Hey everyone!

I’m looking for an old TikTok posted by @sandatori around June 5, 2021. It featured the L Nendoroid from Death Note sitting in a mini bakery set (possibly Re-Ment). The caption was something like:

“Reply to @sokaziya I caved…”

It had soft lighting, a pink bakery setup, and L sipping coffee.

If anyone downloaded it, re-uploaded it, or has a mirror link—or even screenshots—please let me know.

Thanks!

* **Massive Savings:** 10 descaler tablets can cost $10+, while 100g of citric acid (enough for a *y*ear or two of descaling) costs around $4. + You can use it for many other purposes.
* **Same Active Ingredient:** You're essentially using the same thing as the commercial products, just without the fancy packaging and markup.

\- Don't use vinegar (some coffee machines actually forbid using it, and it leaves a smell. 

  
Always read your coffee machine manual! -- Citric acid is generally safe (it is the main ingredient in commercial products). For example, my manual even said that I can use citric acid alone.



**How to Do It:**

1. **Empty your coffee machine's water tank.**
2. **Add about 1 tablespoon of citric acid powder** to the tank. (For a standard 1-liter water tank, this seems to be the sweet spot for me. Adjust slightly if your tank is much larger or smaller).
3. **Fill the tank with 1 liter of water** (or to your machine's max fill line).
4. **Stir gently** to help the citric acid dissolve.
5. **Run your coffee machine's descaling cycle** as per its instructions. If your machine doesn't have a dedicated cycle, just run several brewing cycles with the citric acid solution (without coffee, of course!) until the tank is empty.
6. **Important: Rinse Thoroughly!** After the descaling cycle(s), fill the water tank with **plain, clean water** and run several cycles through the machine to flush out any remaining citric acid. You don't want sour coffee! Do this until you can't taste any acidity.",17,1749930639.0,lifehacks,14,0.84,False

I’m a 22-year-old introvert,  and a mom. I’m mostly a hermit outside of my usual responsibilities and my boyfriend. Most days I’m either overwhelmed or on autopilot, and I realized I miss having other people to talk to — about stupid memes, deep life stuff, or just “wtf is today” venting.

I’m into dark, spicy romance books (like Haunting Adeline, Twisted Series, Credence), iced protein coffee, sarcastic humor, dessert ideas I’ll probably never bake, and talking about life in that raw, no-filter way.

I’ve got BPD, so I can be intense and shy at the same time, but I’ve got a good heart and I’m loyal once I feel safe. I’d love to talk through voice notes, text, or chill chats here and there no  pressure.

1lbhdbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/groupSense/comments/1lbhdbw/if_oversharing_with_strangers_is_our_secret/,If oversharing with strangers is our secret therapy?,"So, I was flying back home the other day and got to chatting with the guy next to me. You know, the usual small talk kind of stuff. But then, out of nowhere, he started telling me about his recent breakup and how he was feeling lost, which seemed pretty heavy for a guy I just exchanged names with. 🤷‍♀️ It kinda got me thinking... why do people do that?

Maybe it's something about the temporary nature of the setting? Like, you're stuck sitting next to each other for a few hours, and then you'll part ways, probably never seeing each other again. I wonder if it’s like this secret little therapy session. It’s not like you’re going to bump into them at the local coffee shop and have an awkward moment and all. There's zero risk, you know?

Or could it be something about the setting triggering this? I remember reading about the ""stranger on the bus"" phenomenon, where people feel comfy sharing personal stuff because they’re not tied up in your life, and won’t judge you the way friends might. It makes me wonder if he's hoping for sympathy or maybe just an ear because he doesn't normally get to talk about it? I don’t know, it’s just one of those things that’s been rattling around in my brain.

about my recent 3 coffee experience

My first ever in a long time - after i found out it was just them doing it to me - 
Was a honey oat latte
Instead of two shots of espresso
I asked for one or lesser
And this is what i found - idk coffee that well

And it says - 1 single shot of espresso is generally considered strong
1 ounce - 63mg of caffeine

(Pic here) 

And nothing happened to me when i drank it compared to before. It was worse before.! Really!

And im asking this question because
i drank this a week ago
As well as before that
The first time before rhis ""last week""
Nothing happened to me and i slept easily
Bit this last week

Jolibee ""iced mocha"" coffee drink

i felt immediately my heart beat was going fast and everything.
Anxious, hard tiem breathing, like the symptoms they do in v2k

I could tell it was all fake
And i was right. I searched an article about the mocha or the drink basically
And it said this

Im asking this for evidence and proof!

- I wanted your perspective and opinion if they made me hot and faint and all fake symtoms on purpose?

- and how? - lots of detail please!

I immediately shivered and Rush stopped and wrapped his arms around me. “We need to go to the house. I’m not going to make her stand out here and talk. It’s too damn cold,” Rush told his father. Dean finally stopped walking and looked..."," Blaire  
Without stage makeup and black leather clothing he looked like an older version of Rush. I had to move quickly to keep up with Rush who had my hand clasped tightly in his as he walked swiftly outside away from the other guests in the bar. His father led the way. I wasn’t sure if Rush was happy to see him or not. The only interaction they’d had was Rush nodding his head toward the door. He obviously hadn’t wanted this introduction to have an audience.  Dean Finlay, the world’s most notorious drummer, stopped several times on our way out to autograph items shoved in front of him. It wasn’t just females either. One guy had even stepped forward and asked him to sign a bar napkin. The threatening gleam in Rush’s eyes as he tried to get his father out of the bar kept the rest of them away. Instead, they all remained silent and watched as Slacker Demon’s drummer headed out the door.  The night breeze was cold now. I immediately shivered and Rush stopped and wrapped his arms around me. “We need to go to the house. I’m not going to make her stand out here and talk. It’s too damn cold,” Rush told his father.  Dean finally stopped walking and looked back at me. His eyes slowly took me in and I could see the moment he noticed my stomach.  
  “Dean, this is Blaire Wynn. My fiancée. Blaire, this is Dean Finlay, my father,” Rush said in a tight voice. He didn’t sound like he wanted to make this introduction.  
  
  “No one told me I was gonna be a grandpa,” he said in a slow drawl. I wasn’t sure how he felt about that because there was no emotion on his face.  
  
  “I’ve been busy,” was the only response Rush gave him. That was odd. Was he embarrassed to tell his dad? I felt sick at my stomach and started to ease away from him.  
  
  His arms tightened their hold on me and I could feel his attention focused completely on me. “What’s wrong?” he asked, turning his back on his father and bending down so he could look me directly in the eyes.  
  
  I didn’t want to have this conversation in front of Dean. I could feel his dad’s eyes on both of us. I shook my head but my body was still tense. I couldn’t help that. The fact he hadn’t told his father was bothering me.  
  
  “I’m taking her to the car. I’ll meet you back at the house,” Rush said over his shoulder but kept his eyes focused on mine. I dropped my gaze, wishing I hadn’t reacted now. I was making a scene. Dean was going to think I was a whiny princess.  
  
  I opened my mouth to argue when Rush wrapped his arm around my waist and led me to the Range Rover. He was anxious. He didn’t like me upset, which was something we needed to work on. I would get upset. He couldn’t control that.  
  
  Rush opened the passenger side door and lifted me up and put me in like I was five. When he thought I was upset he started treating me like a child. We really needed to work on that too.  
  
  He didn’t even have his door closed before he looked at me. “Something is wrong. I need to know so I can fix it. ”  
  
  I sighed and sank back against the seat. I might as well get this over with even if I was being a little touchy. “Why haven’t you told your dad about the baby?”  
  
  Rush reached over and closed his hand over mine. “That’s what’s wrong? You’re upset because I haven’t told Dean?”  
  
  I nodded and kept my eyes on our hands resting on my leg.  
  
  “I haven’t taken time to track him down. And I knew he’d show up when I told him because he’d want to meet you. I wasn’t ready for company just yet. Especially him. ”  
  
  I was being silly. Lately my emotions were on high alert. I lifted my eyes and met his concerned gaze. “Okay. I understand that. ”  
  
  Rush leaned over and kissed my lips gently. “I’m sorry I upset you,” he whispered before pressing one more kiss to the corner of my lips and leaning back. It was moments like these that I became a swoony mess.  
  
  “He’s here now. So, let’s go see what brought him here before my mother finds out. I want you to myself. I don’t like having my fucked up family around. ”  
  
  Rush didn’t let go of my hand as he cranked the engine and pulled out onto the road. I laid my head against the seat and turned it so I could look at him. His unshaven jaw made him look older and untamed. Very sexy. I wish he’d not shave more often. I liked the way it felt too. He had taken out his earring and hardly ever wore it anymore.  
  
  “Why do you think he’s here?” I asked  
  
  Rush glanced over at me. “I was hoping he was here to meet you. But I don’t think he knew about you yet. He looked surprised. So that means this very well could be about Nan. ”  
  
  Nan. His sister hadn’t been back to Rosemary since her release from the hospital. Rush didn’t seem to be worried about it but he loved his sister. I hated being the reason she stayed away. Now that she knew who her real father was and that I had never taken anything away from her I’d hoped we could be friends for Rush’s sake. It didn’t look like that was going to happen.  
  
  “Do you think Nan has gone to see Kiro?” I asked.  
  
  Rush shrugged. “I don’t know. She seems different since her accident. ”  
  
  The car came to a stop outside the large beach house that had been purchased for Rush by his father when he was just a kid. Rush squeezed my hand. “I love you, Blaire. I’m so damn proud of the fact you’re going to be the mother of my son. I want everyone to know. Never doubt that. ”  
  
  My eyes stung with tears and I nodded before picking up his hand and kissing it. “I get emotional. You need to ignore me when I get like that. ”  
  
  Rush shook his head. “I can’t ignore you. I want to reassure you. ”  
  
  The passenger side door opened and I jerked my head around to see Dean Finlay standing there with a smirk on his face. “Let the woman out of the car, son. It’s time I met the mother of my grandchild. ”  
  
  Dean held out his hand and I put mine in his not sure what else to do. His long fingers wrapped around my hand and he helped me down out of the Range Rover. Rush was there immediately taking my hand from his father’s and pulling me over to him. His dad chuckled and shook his head. “I’ll be damned. ”  
  
  “Let’s get inside,” Rush replied.  
 RUSH  
  
  Dean walked over to the sofa and sank down on it before pulling out a pack of cigarettes. Shit. He was not what I wanted to deal with right now. “Can’t smoke in here or around Blaire, for that matter. It’s bad for the baby. ”  
  
  Dean cocked one of his eyebrows. “Hell boy, I’m pretty damn sure your momma smoked cigarettes when she was pregnant with you. ”  
  
  I had no doubt that she did that and more. No way I’d expose my kid to that stuff. “Doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Blaire is nothing like Mom. ”  
  
  At the mention of her name, Blaire walked into the living room carrying two beers. I hadn’t asked her to get them. I didn’t like to see her wait on anyone. But she did it anyway. I walked over and met her halfway. “You didn’t have to get these,” I told her taking them from her as I placed a kiss on her temple.  
  
  “I know. But we have a guest. I want him to feel welcome. ”  
  
  The sweet smile on her lips made it hard to concentrate on my dad. I wanted to take her up to the bedroom.  
  
  “Bring me the beer boy, and stop being so damn overbearing. You’re gonna smother the girl. Don’t know what the fuck has gotten into you. ”  
  
  A small bubble of laughter came from Blaire’s lips and I decided since he’d made her laugh I’d overlook his words.  
  
  “Here,” I said, shoving the beer his way. “Now, why’re you here?”  
  
  “What? Can’t a dad come see his son when he wants to?”  
  
  “It’s Rosemary. You never come here. ”  
  
  Dean shrugged and took a swig of his beer, then threw an arm over the back of the sofa and propped both his feet up on the coffee table. “Your sister is a crazy bitch. She’s fucking insane. We need help. ”  
  
  It was about Nan. I’d thought it might be. I sat down on the chair across from him and held my hand out to Blaire. I didn’t want her standing and I wanted her to feel welcome in our conversation. She walked over to me and I pulled her down to sit on my lap. “What has Nan done?” I asked, almost afraid to hear the answer.  
  
  Dean took another long swig of his beer. Then ran his hand through his long shaggy hair. “Question is, what hasn’t she done. Damn girl is raising hell. We can’t get any rest. We finished up the tour two weeks ago and came back to LA to enjoy some down time. She showed up and all hell broke loose. No one is getting any down time. Kiro doesn’t know what to do with her. We need some help. ”  
  
  I knew Nan had been quiet but I hadn’t expected her to go to LA and search Kiro out. She knew my dad and Kiro shared a Beverly Hills mansion. They’d been living in it when they weren’t touring all my life. Kiro had been married a couple times and he’d moved out during those times but after each divorce he came back. It was known as the Slacker Demon mansion. No one was ever really sure which band members were in residence at any given time.  
  
  “Is she staying at the mansion?” I asked.  
  
  Dad raised his eyebrows. “Do I look like an idiot to you? Fuck no, she isn’t staying there. She just shows up all the damn time. She’s making demands and shit. Kiro has tried to smooth things over and form some sort of relationship with her but she won’t let him. She won’t listen and she. . . well, she found out he has another daughter. Didn’t go over well. ”  
  
  Apparently she didn’t know about Kiro’s son yet but then Mase never came around.  
  
  “She must be so upset,” Blaire said with actual concern in her voice. How Blaire could feel any sympathy for Nan I didn’t know. “You need to go see her. Help her deal with this and see if you can’t help her and Kiro form some sort of relationship. ”  
  
  I started to disagree but Dean cut me off.  
  
  “I like her already. That’s exactly what you need to do. Your room is empty and you know it’s comfortable. Bring Blaire with you and that’ll give me a chance to get to know her and spend time with you as well. If you don’t Kiro may end up killing Nan. ”  
  
  Blaire squeezed my shoulder. “I think we should go. Nan needs you. ”  
  
  I tilted my head back and looked up at her. “Why do you care what Nan needs?” I asked in awe.  
  
  “Because you love her,” was her simple reply.  
  
  “This one’s a keeper. Now, enough about Nan. I wanna know when this baby is due and when the wedding is,” Dean said with a cheerful tone. Much different from the one he was using when he spoke about Nan.  
  
  Blaire looked over at my dad and smiled. “I’m twenty weeks pregnant. The baby isn’t due until mid-April. As for the wedding we were going to get married in two weeks but I don’t want this to be weighing on Rush. I’d rather put the wedding off and let him deal with family issues first. We haven’t mailed out invitations or anything. So changing the date isn’t a problem. ”  
  
  “No. I’m not waiting any longer to change your last name,” I argued but Blaire put her finger over my lips.  
  
  “Shhh. I don’t want to argue about this. I can’t enjoy our wedding knowing you have family issues to deal with. Let’s enjoy Thanksgiving with our friends like we’d planned and then go to LA and deal with Nan. Once you have all that behind you then we can focus on our wedding. ”  
  
  I didn’t want to wait. I hated the idea of her still being Blaire Wynn while our baby grew inside her. I wanted her to have my name and for the world to know I wanted her and my baby. But the determined gleam in her eyes told me I wasn’t going to win this argument.  
  
  “I just want you to be happy,” I finally replied.  
  
  Blaire kissed the tip of my nose. “I know you do. One of the many reasons I love you. ”  
  
  “If you’re waiting until after Thanksgiving to head back to LA and deal with that sister of yours then so am I. Besides, it’s been years since I spent a Thanksgiving with you,” my dad announced.  
  
  I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.  
  
  “We would love to have you here, Mr. Finlay,” Blaire informed him, smiling brightly like she really meant it. Fuck. I was gonna have to let this happen.  
  
  “Just call me Dean, sweetheart. We’re already family. ”  
  
  The pleased look in her eyes made me smile. Maybe having my dad around for Thanksgiving wouldn’t be so bad after all. If he could make Blaire smile then I’d deal with it.

  
 BLAIRE  
  
  Talking about Thanksgiving had reminded me of my mother. This would be my first holiday without her. The more that sank in the harder it became to breathe. I forced a smile and made my excuses before rushing upstairs to take a shower. Rush needed some alone time with his dad anyway.  
  
  I let the tears I’d held back fall freely as I undressed and stepped into the shower. The warm water rained down over me as a sob broke free. Last year I had cooked our Thanksgiving meal and we had eaten it together in the dining room. No friends or family. Just the two of us. I’d cried that night too. Because deep down I’d known it was my last Thanksgiving with my mother. The memories of years gone by when Valerie and Dad had been there were bittersweet. My heart ached for all we’d lost. I hadn’t thought anything could hurt as badly but I knew now that I was wrong.  
  
  Facing the holidays without my mom was going to be hard. She loved Thanksgiving and Christmas. We would always start decorating the house for Christmas on Thanksgiving Day. Then we’d sit down and watch White Christmas together that evening while we ate leftover turkey and sweet potato casserole. It had been our tradition. Even after we lost Valerie and Dad had left us.  
  
  This year everything would be different. Knowing Rush would be with me and that I was starting a new family of my own eased the ache. I just wished my mother were here to see me this happy.  
  
  The door opened and I spun around to see Rush walk into the bathroom. He was frowning. He stopped and he studied me a moment before pulling his shirt off and throwing it onto the marble floor. Then he unsnapped his jeans and stepped out of them and his boxer briefs. I watched as he stepped into the shower.  
  
  “Why’re you crying?” he asked, cupping my face in his hands. I knew the shower had washed away my tears but my eyes must still be red.  
  
  I shook my head and smiled at him. I didn’t want to worry him with my emotions.  
  
  “I heard you when I opened the door to the bedroom. I need to know why, Blaire. ”  
  
  I sighed and laid my head against his chest then wrapped my arms around his waist. I had lost a lot but God had made up for that by giving me Rush. I needed to remember just how blessed I really was. “The fact this is my first Thanksgiving without my mom kind of hit me,” I admitted.  
  
  Rush’s arms tightened around me. “I’m sorry, baby,” he whispered into my hair as he held me.  
  
  “Me too. I wish you could have met her, I mean, now that you’re older. I wish she could’ve seen you all grown up. ”  
  
  “I wish I could have to. I’m sure she was as perfect as you are. ”  
  
  Smiling, I wanted to disagree. I was nowhere near as perfect as my mother. She was one of those special people that the world doesn’t see often.  
  
  “If my dad being here is going to be hard on you I’ll send him away. I want to make this a good memory for you. Anything I can do to help you just tell me and I’ll do it. ”  
  
  Tears trickled freely down my face again. Stupid pregnancy hormones made me a leaking fountain lately. “Having you with me makes it all better. Just talking about it made it sink in. Momma loved Thanksgiving. I knew last year was the last one we’d spend together. The entire day I did everything I could to make it special for her. And me. I knew I’d need that memory. ”  
  
  Rush rubbed small circles on my back and held me in silence. We stood there while the water ran over us for several minutes. Finally he pulled back enough to look down at me. “Can I bathe you?” he asked.  
  
  I nodded, unsure what he meant. He reached for one of the clean washcloths stacked up outside the shower and picked up one of my bottles of body wash. Then he began washing my back and shoulders. He picked up each of my arms as if I were a child and washed them thoroughly. I stood there and watched him as he concentrated on cleaning every inch of my body. He didn’t make it sexual which surprised me. Instead, it was more sweet and innocent than anything else we’d ever done. His hand didn’t linger as he washed between my legs. He only pressed his lips to my stomach once as he knelt in front of me and washed my legs and feet.  
  
  Once he was finished he stood up and began rinsing my body with his hands. Each touch seemed almost reverent. As if he were worshiping me instead of washing me. When my body was clean he moved to my hair. I closed my eyes as his hands massaged my scalp. My knees went a little weak from the pleasure of it. Rush quickly rinsed the shampoo from my hair and then did my conditioning, giving it just as much attention before running my hair under the clean water again.  
  
  My body was relaxed from the pampering. I was almost sluggish. Rush turned off the water and reached for two large towels. One he wrapped in my hair and the other one he wrapped around my body. Then he picked me up, carried me to the bed, and laid me down.  
  
  “Just rest. I’ll be right back,” he whispered before kissing my forehead and walking back to the bathroom. The view of his naked ass was tempting and I wanted to stay awake. Having him touch me that way had turned me on even if that hadn’t been his intention. I tried to wait on him but my eyes grew heavy and I faded away.  
  
  I snuggled deeper into the warmth. It smelled of sunshine and ocean air. Sighing contentedly, I rubbed my cheek against the comforting warmth. It chuckled.  
  
  My eyes opened and Rush’s bare chest was pressed up against my face. Smiling, I kissed it and peered up at him. The amused smirk on his lips only made me giggle.  
  
  “You’re like a little kitten in the mornings,” he said with a deep husky voice. He must have just woken up too.  
  
  “If you didn’t feel so good I wouldn’t be searching you out to rub up against you in my sleep. ”  
  
  Rush winked. “Then I’m glad I feel good because your sweet ass isn’t going to be rubbing against anyone else. I’d have to kill someone. ”  
  
  I loved this man.  
  
  “I’m sorry I fell asleep so quickly last night. ”  
  
  Rush shook his head. “Don’t be. I love knowing I relaxed you and it was easy for you to fall asleep. I don’t like seeing you sad. ”  
  
  I loved this man a whole damn lot.  
  
  Stretching against him, I slipped both hands behind his neck and pressed my body against his. I squeezed my legs from the tingle of anticipation when his erection brushed my upper thigh. I needed him this morning. After the sweet moment last night I needed to feel completely connected now.  
  
  “Make love to me,” I whispered tucking my head in the crook between his neck and shoulder.  
  
  “My pleasure,” he murmured and slipped his hand in between my thighs. He lifted one of my legs up and rested it on his hip. I was wide open and the exposed feeling excited me. His fingers grazed the inside of my thighs, teasing me by barely brushing at my swollen needy entrance. I whimpered, hoping to hurry him up but he would not be pressured. Instead, it seemed to make him worse. His rough fingertips traced patterns from my knees up to the very top of my thigh then back again.  
  
  I was positive that his play had caused me to get embarrassingly wet. “Rush, please. ”  
  
  “Please what, sweet Blaire. What do you want me to do?”  
  
  I’d told him what I wanted already. Apparently, he wanted to hear more. Rush and his naughty talk always excited me. “Touch me. ”  
  
  “I am touching you,” he replied.  
  
  “Touch me higher,” I begged. He wanted me to talk dirty. I was going to tease him too.  
  
  He ran his finger in in the crease of my thigh and I gripped his arms tightly and trembled. He was so close. “Here?” he asked.  
  
  I shifted so that his finger slipped closer. He started to move his hand away and stopped. “Fuck,” he moaned sliding his finger into me slowly. “So wet. I can’t tease you when you’re already so wet,” he whispered.  
  
  I cried out as he gently ran his fingertip over my clit. He had me spread open and having his hands touching me only made me crazier. I wanted more.  
  
  “My sweet girl was so ready for me,” he said moving two fingers inside me and pressing against my g spot.  
  
  The loud cry of pleasure that ripped out of me was more than he could handle. He grabbed my waist and positioned me over him before slowly sinking me down over his cock. “Damn, how’d it get tighter?” he growled, squeezing my hips and rocking against me as I sat down on him taking every inch inside me. This was what I’d wanted. To be full. Of Rush.

Early this morning (June 14), I missed what might’ve been one of the biggest chances of my life — a beautiful girl with the most amazing smile. She flew from Kingston, Jamaica to New York on a JetBlue flight.

We ran into each other a few times at the airport — at the shop, by the coffee stand — and she smiled at me more than once while we were waiting for our flights. But I was too much of a coward to go talk to her or even say hi.

Her smile was absolutely stunning. I haven’t been able to think about anything else since — just this beautiful, slim girl and how badly I messed up by not saying anything. I kept hoping we were on the same flight, but she ended up boarding the New York flight (she was one of the last to board), while I flew to Miami on American Airlines.

Please help me find her. I just want the chance to tell her how much I regret not speaking to her — and how completely charming and beautiful I thought she was",1,1749930253.0,MissedSoulmates,0,1.0,False

Sorry for the inconvenience, when I posted last time I was tired and in my 'fuck-all' mood. Now I put in proper effort. Anyway, here's the continuation:

Cermada's pain induced night came to end as her eyelids begrudgingly opened. Blurring back, she noticed her wounds were...healed. And it was night. She flapped her wings; the skin there patched to an old rag's worth. The orange embers of the fire flared as Sydran was sitting with the human who took her down over a log.

""Sydran. What are you doing? Why didn't you help me, and why are you with it?"" She then noticed the emerald, drunken gaze in Cermada. A school kid wondering what time it is. She shifted to her, ears perked a bit while the man turned around too. ""This is Konan. And I'm talking with him about Terran history. Also, I don't fight losing battles, if you can't beat them."" 

The man turned too, flashing a salary man T-shirt and pants she hardly noticed earlier. ""Thanks, you Sydran. By the way your friend told me about your dilemma. I can help with that, but you're going to get killed anyone here in 1-on-1 combat.""

She stood up and strolled to Cermada. That signal beacon still strapped. Cermada positioned herself upwards, sitting on the ground: ""Why didn't you get us out of here? This place is clearly dangerous, let's go already dad can complain later."" A jolt of pain forced upright from her wings brushing a bush.

""Well, I made a promise to your dad you'd get a trophy when we head back. And so by that promise I can't take you back till then. Plus I can't leave you here, you would die, Konan got some bad news for us anyway."" She signaled him with a tail swing, he stood up, approaching to inform. ""Yes. You guys came into this system uninvited. And we have a cloak device shielding which gave you that old  400 year info that Sydran told me about.""

Cermada looked up to him, his spear by the fire. ""OK so how's that a problem you oversized monkey? Plus that doesn't make any sense, you guys don't have FTL disruptors like Sydran said, we didn't even see any vessels near your planets, how the hell do you have something as advanced as cloaking."" 

His deep voice rumbled, a low chickle you get from a person who likes dark coffee. With a skewer of what looked like charred antelope behind, over the fire. 

""Well no. Sol has a defense system with an AI running the cloak. The reason why you passed our defenses is because it did not identify your ship as threat, and your FTL technology is primitive. But now it has learned, meaning you can't leave or you'll be shot down.""

Sydran, looked at her. For once a small whine coming out. '*Fuck she's not gonna take this well.*'- she thought. Just then she could here her heart thumping, like climbing stairs against the roughed scales. Stiffening limbs became apparent, as the revelation came. ""We're stuck here? No I'm not staying on this ape infested rock. Sydran, take that damn craft we flew with. Get me out of here!""

""No we can't. Hell can't even call your dad, he'd be blown up now."" Sydran tried to comfort her slightly, but the potholes dug by Cermada's skittering feet as she tried to stand up wasn't a green light.

""Well how the hell are we supposed to get out of here! Sydran, do something what does Dravok pay you for!"" She stood up still squashed by Konan's height, she wasn't used to literally being looked down on, now prey being eyed. But her bravado, the paper it was met his cold amused eyes under the moonlight canopy.

""I don't know but crying is not going to help you. Your best chance is to get a phase key to pass the black domain. We don't use warp drives like you, we've been at war for 400 hundred years. It's 2025, we have dymorphers- drives that allow us to travel on a higher dimensional plain, hence why you didn't see anyone."" He was now eating the meat, finishing it in a few bites, before throwing the skewer away. Sydran having already ate from earlier portions.

But he gave her one last look. ""Just remember this, I could have killed you. Most people would have drawn blood and butchered you by now, or worse. I'm doing this out of mercy because tomorrow I have an important robotics project meeting. So I'll get you into town, but once there you are not my problems. OK?"" 

He sat down by the log, back against the hard wood with his eyes closed. His shirt taught around the muscled frame. ""Don't cause me any problems like earlier or I'll leave the jungle to sort you out."" 

Sydran laid down, by the fire too. Hunched in a loafing position cats do, those orange glints looked at Cermada one last time. ""Don't rush things. For now, stay low.""

She sat there with her almost mint condition wings- if you squinted. The stay was gonna be long and she knew it. Then her thoughts shifted in the darkness of the moon's own setting. *Would her dad even take her back?*

The next day the sun shined a good orange peel. The leaves and twigs quiet as Cermada and Sydran woke up. Konan was standing fire already out. ""The town is only a few kilometers away. We'll be there before 10:00."" Cermada got up, her moves sapped with rocks and sadness as her bed instead of silk and nano engineered moss. 

""Fuck. It hurts. What time is it? I'm starving."" She asked, sitting up. ""It's 06:00. There's food at town. Get up, I was serious about yesterday."" She did, putting up her tail on the log. ""Wait wouldn't your people just kill us like you said?"" She groaned with a stretch, seeing Konan nudging Sydran with his shoe gently. ""No. Most people will just think you are lab experiments. A lot of us have seen plenty of man-made monstrosities, you 2 look like refreshments.""

Sydran got up, stretching too, Konan pointed in the direction for the settlement which she followed. He also then started walking. ""Wait, don't leave me."" Cermada got up and limped in following, those new butcher's choice kneecaps not faring well. But butcher's choice, remember. 

30 minutes passed and they were deep through the dense foliage of carnivorous plants and too many vines, trees zigzagging like a left-over game of chess. He had climbed a few to traverse, picking them up where needed. Now Cermada was slung over his shoulder, sweaty again. Even Sydran looked tired. ""Hey, are you not wet? You're bigger than us anyway."" Cermada panted, the black fabric she wore clinging to his arm

His brown eyes looked at her. ""Endurance. Humans are made for long distance walking or running. I guess we even beat aliens."" His foot proceeded to crush an inch wide millipede the length of a snake with a crunch. Walking still, the trees began to thin. ""Are we almost there yet?"" Sydran inquired.

""No, now we're entering the savanna. But there should be a water edict around now."" By now almost another hour had passed but then in shorter grass a white statue met them in path, under the blistering blue of a sky that felt dyed. Konan set her down to her feet, under a circular stone pavement.

He opened a tap and gestured for her to drink. ""It's edible princess."" Sydran shook her fur, lapping the pouring water while Cermada looked skeptical. That shit wasn't the glass level pure she was used to. But she caught Sydran's look, growling, half snarl. ""I don't think our friend would *poison* us after all the *hospitality* he showed us. Drink."" 

She said, finishing her drink. Cermada's hands stalled in that glaze of a scowl she was getting. But she caved, scooping it in. ""It tastes like rusted dirt!"" It did not. She pulled away, the statue of a robed man literally looking down on her. ""Who is this bastard anyway?""

Sydran started walking down the golden long grass, ignoring the conversation turned monologue. Konan's spear glinted as he held it tighter, he immediately saw her face stress just slightly. ""That my friend is Mansa Musa the third. This was built during his reign, as a gift by Ishaq Ali the second. 2 very important people that you disgraced."" 

He walked away, following Sydran. Cermada limped for the next hour, with Konan dragging her by rope on the ground for the second after she cried about her condition. Along the path the place seemed peaceful, not any hellscape Sydran was expecting from a war spanning 4 centuries.

""Are you guys really at war? It's so quiet."" Sydran's eyes wandered to him at her side. ""yes we are at war. But we are in the interior of the continent. Most fighting happens at sea and by Ethiopian to Ottoman boarders, if you were to only count the African-Middle East bloc.""

""Why did this war start anyway and how did it escalate this badly? No reasonable amount of trauma takes a species from your ancestors to *this.""* Sydran nodded at him. Konan chuckled a bit and continued. 

""Your right. This all started when a sequence of rebellions across all of the European colonies broke off the chains of oppression, using stollen gunpowder and technology rebellion groups fought against the then weak and famine struck opposing forces. Due to bad logistic delays, they were wiped out.

But the people of those colonies were skeptical, many had already endured horrible fates under the white people so everyone from the Americas to the west of Asia and Australia began to rapidly industrialize in preparation to finally exterminate them.

But once ready, Europe had recovered and began to try and reclaim its lost territory. Although it was them against the world, they had far *far* better war experience and have been holding their ground and winning small chunks back till the present day. 

Throughout all those centuries we turned to more and more extreme, desperate tactics to win or at the very least survive. And now every human is today's the product of that relentless arms race for supremacy.""

Sydran paused, ignoring the cry of Cermada in the back. Her fur seemed to stand on edge. ""So that's why you're so advanced. You never left your system because you were always fighting. I'm sorry, how many people died? That's...haunting."" Konan didn't skip a beat. ""Around 24 trillion. Don't be scared, we chose this."" 

In the horizon a few structures began to appear as they stepped on proper road, made of obsidian. Konan went back a few steps for Cermada, her body bruised. Sliding her there might get her cut. He carried her again, but it was for the final push. 

As they entered town many buildings patchworked farms, with drones and solar panels intertwined efficiently with crop. Old quiet houses watched over them, with modern architecture blended in. The buildings got a bit taller as they entered the marketplace, bustling with bioengineered vegetables, appliances like plasma furnaces of dual cooling processors. People around buying and gossiping.

""We are here. As promised you are no longer my problem. But I'll accommodate you till tomorrow; help you find a place to stay."" He looked to Cermada, her having kept her mouth shut for a while now. ""I will find a friend who'll teach you how to fight, to kill someone in battle. And get you that phase key to escape once."" His voice rumbled again.

It was a promise, that would take root maybe a few whiles later. Then out by a red stall, a man waved at him. He was wearing the same T-shirt and black pants, and with a tie. ""Konan! Come here, you made it!"" 

""Sydran, let's go now."" He walked up calmly to him Cermada still there. The man smiled by, seeing him face to face. ""Konan, long time no see. The robotics department wants a new model for the nanite production, did you get a new dog? And lizard?""

Konan chuckled, walking to the building behind the man. ""these 2 are just friends Jacob. I would not say pets by the way."" He stepped in through an automatic door, the hum of cold and sterile lights beaming, revealing a massive assembly line with robots and drones sparking and welding, to assisting and managing. Jacob came in, closing the door with a wave of his hand. A boardroom window, with a black frame overwatched the facility from a 2-story view. Filled with others dressed in that plain T-shirt and pants combo.

This post is for people living near Amsterdam or in the Netherlands. Sorry about it but long distance is not my thing..

I live in Amsterdam and living in Europe for more than 15 years. I am learning Dutch and I’m more confident that I will learn it someday unlike German 😅

I’m a 36-year-old Indian origin, whose father says he is no longer Indian 🤣. Probably because I picked up things from various cultures while living in and traveling to multiple countries, and they really changed how I see and live my life. I’ve light tanned skin, Black hair, Brown eyes, 183cm tall (not tall by Dutch standards, but I can reach things on the top shelf), broad shoulders, slightly muscular, and powered mostly by hugs.

I work in senior management at an international company – fancy title, but still can’t remember name of people I meet.

Now onto the good stuff…

Who am I?

📸 Photography nerd – will lie in mud for the perfect sunset shot.

🏍️ Motorbike rider – nothing beats a long ride with no destination.

🥾 Hiking enthusiast – let’s climb something tall and wonder why we did.

🍳 Lazy-ass cook – food’s great, but I don’t follow recipes, I follow mood.

🍰 Sweet tooth champion – will propose if you bake a great cake.

🏋️‍♂️ Lift weights – Muscles and fitness is as important as eating cake.

✈️ Travel addict – have passport, seen many countries, will explore more. Next dream: settle near water, adopt pets, live slow.

Looking for someone who fit at least one or two things below.

• Enjoys hugs and cuddles like I do oxygen.

• Likes travel, nature, and lazy Sundays.

• Takes care of her body and health (but yes, we can eat cake).

• Is open to pets and future waterside living.

• Love to Bake (or at least enables my dessert addiction).

I love affection – hugs, cuddles, forehead kisses, the whole warm and fuzzy package. I don't enjoy penetrative sex, but show my love/intimacy through touch, affection and closeness. So, if you are comfortable with this and think you can bear with me in real life then send me a message!

Let’s make a life full of adventure, laughter, and cake crumbs.

We will be a good match if you don't think a “great connection” means endless texting and a job interview 😂 Let's have a real-life convo over coffee, a walk, or anything low-pressure.",0,1749930147.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False
1lbh7y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lbh7y9/i_bought_a_book_that_revealed_my_worst_fears_then/,I bought a book that revealed my worst fears... Then reality began to fall apart,"The rain had been falling all day, an unbroken sheet of grey draping over the city. I watched the droplets race down my apartment window, merging together and disappearing, much like my thoughts these days. Writing had once been a way to escape from the chaos of life, but now, it felt like I was trying to dig my way out of quicksand, every word pulled me deeper into exhaustion and self-doubt.

I was a freelance writer, though I hadn’t been writing much lately. My income, always precarious, had become even more unstable. Each assignment seemed like a Herculean task, the simplest projects dragging on for days, sometimes weeks, as I wrestled with my dwindling creativity. There was a time when words flowed effortlessly, when stories spilled onto the page with a natural rhythm, but those days felt like they belonged to someone else. I couldn’t even remember the last time I’d written something that truly excited me.

The isolation wasn’t helping. My small apartment, cluttered with stacks of books, old notes, and unfinished manuscripts, felt less like a sanctuary and more like a tomb. It was always too quiet. Occasionally, the muffled sounds of traffic or distant conversations would seep in through the thin walls, but they did little to break the heavy silence. Most days, I wouldn’t speak a word out loud until the late afternoon, when I’d finally force myself to venture out for groceries or a cup of coffee, just to see some other human faces. Even then, my interactions were fleeting and empty, quick exchanges with baristas or cashiers who probably wouldn’t recognize me if I came in the next day.

My friends, the ones I had shared laughs and secrets with in college, had all moved on to busy lives filled with families, careers, and social circles that I no longer fit into. The group chats that once buzzed with messages were now quiet, just like everything else. I would scroll through them sometimes, reading old conversations and wondering how the thread had become so frayed.

I had tried reaching out, making small attempts to reconnect, but our conversations always felt forced, as if we were actors playing parts in a show that had long since been canceled. Eventually, I stopped trying. The solitude grew thicker, and I began to fear it was becoming a part of me, wrapping itself around my bones like a second skin.

It was on one of those bleak, rainy days that I decided I couldn’t stay cooped up inside any longer. I grabbed my coat and left my apartment, not knowing where I was headed, just that I needed to escape, if only for a little while. The rain was cold as it hit my face, a sharp contrast to the stifling warmth of the apartment. I wandered aimlessly through the city, past familiar cafes and storefronts, not feeling any particular draw to any of them.

My feet carried me down streets I rarely ventured, through neighborhoods that grew older and more weathered the deeper I went. Eventually, I found myself standing in a narrow, dimly lit alleyway I didn’t recognize. It was tucked between two towering brick buildings, their facades stained dark with age and rain. I hesitated, wondering if I had taken a wrong turn somewhere, but then I saw it: an old wooden sign swaying slightly in the damp breeze.

""Lost Pages,"" it read, the letters barely visible under the layers of dust and grime. The bookstore’s narrow windows were cluttered with faded paperbacks and old-fashioned leather-bound volumes, their covers dulled by time. The glass panes were fogged with moisture, and the light within was dim and flickering.

Curiosity piqued, I pushed open the door, and the old-fashioned bell above the frame jangled faintly. The air inside was heavy, filled with the scent of aged paper and wood polish. It was darker than I expected, with most of the light filtering in from the narrow front windows. The store was cluttered, chaotic even, with stacks of books piled high on tables and chairs, shelves sagging under the weight of countless volumes. Narrow aisles twisted and turned, leading deeper into the shadows.

I wandered through the narrow aisles, running my fingers over the books that seemed to belong to another era. Some were printed in faded typefaces, their covers cracked and peeling, while others looked like handmade journals, stitched together by someone’s careful hands, long ago. The deeper I ventured, the quieter the world seemed to grow, the hum of the city fading into the background as if I had stepped into another time altogether.

It was then that I saw it. The book lay on a small table tucked away in the back, almost hidden under a pile of yellowing maps. It was a small, nondescript leather-bound book, no larger than a pocket diary, and the cover was worn, its once-rich brown faded to a dull, murky shade. There were no words on the spine, no title or author’s name to give any hint as to what it contained.

I picked it up, feeling an odd chill travel through my fingers as they brushed against the leather. It felt cold to the touch, much colder than any book should be. I opened it, expecting to see faded text or blank pages, but the pages weren’t entirely blank. There were faint marks, almost like shadows of words, that seemed to shimmer and shift as I tilted the book under the dim light. It was as though the text was hiding, revealing itself only from certain angles.

The sound of a floorboard creaking made me jump. I hadn’t noticed the elderly man standing behind the counter, watching me with a faint, unreadable expression. He seemed to blend into the shadows, his clothes faded and old, just like everything else in the shop.

“Find something interesting?” he asked, his voice rough and gravelly.

I held up the book. “What’s this?” I asked, more to break the silence than out of any real expectation for an answer.

The old man’s eyes glinted in the low light. “The book finds those who need it,” he said, as if reciting a well-practiced line. There was a hint of a smile on his lips. “Or perhaps… those it needs.”

I didn’t know what to say to that, but something about the book held my attention. I felt an urge to take it with me.

I glanced back at the man. “How much?” I asked.

His smile widened ever so slightly. “For you? Five dollars.”

It seemed too cheap for such an old book, but I reached into my wallet, handed him the money, and tucked the book under my arm. As I turned to leave, the old man called after me. “Be careful what you find,” he said, his voice low and almost drowned out by the sound of the door creaking open. I glanced back, but he had already turned away, vanishing into the store’s shadowed depths.

Back in the quiet of my apartment, the book sat on my coffee table like a dark presence, a strange weight in the room. I couldn’t seem to ignore it; it was as though it was waiting for me to open it, to uncover whatever secrets lay hidden within its pages. I finally sat down, picked it up, and cracked it open once more.

Words filled the first page in a delicate, slanted script that looked handwritten, as if someone had carefully penned each letter. The words described a memory I had buried long ago, one that sent a shiver down my spine.

It was from when I was a child, maybe eight or nine years old. My parents had taken me to a fair one summer night, filled with bright lights and music. I had wandered off, distracted by a booth selling trinkets, and before I knew it, my parents were nowhere to be found. I remember the panic that had seized me, the suffocating feeling of being lost in a sea of strangers. Hours seemed to pass before a security guard found me crying and reunited me with my frantic parents.

How could this be? I had never told anyone about that experience, not in such vivid detail. Yet, here it was, written out in the book as if someone had been there with me, seeing and feeling everything I had in that moment of fear.

The next morning, the unsettling memory from the book lingered in my mind, refusing to be dismissed. I tried to rationalize it, maybe I had read a similar story somewhere before, or maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. It wasn’t impossible; I had been under a lot of stress lately. I had to shake off the feeling and get out of the apartment. A walk would do me good.

I put on my coat and left the apartment, letting the crisp autumn air fill my lungs. I walked aimlessly, allowing the city to swallow me up. The sound of traffic, the chatter of people, the hum of the city, it was all strangely soothing. My feet carried me through familiar streets, until I ended up in a quieter part of town. I had walked here many times before; I knew these streets well, or so I thought.

I had barely taken a few steps down a narrow side street when I felt a strange sensation wash over me, a tingling chill that prickled the back of my neck. The street looked the same, yet… different. There was something off about it, something I couldn’t quite place. I glanced around, suddenly aware that the street signs didn’t match the names I remembered.

Panic began to creep in, and I reached for my phone to check the GPS. But when I pulled up the map, my location was a blank, grey void. I closed the app and reopened it, thinking it was just a glitch, but the result was the same, no roads, no landmarks, no street names, just an empty screen. A wave of dizziness swept over me, and I felt as if the world had shifted somehow, as though I had walked into a different version of the city.

I continued walking. I passed buildings I didn’t recognize, shops that hadn’t been there the last time I visited this part of town. The more I walked, the more disoriented I became, and soon, I couldn’t tell which way I had come from.

It wasn’t long before a thick fog began to roll in, wrapping itself around the streets like a blanket. It came in fast, swallowing up the pavement and rising up to knee level. The fog was dense, more like smoke than mist. I could barely see a few feet ahead of me. My heart pounded in my chest as the world seemed to fade away, consumed by the murk.

My legs trembled, and I stumbled forward, driven by a need to escape the suffocating fog. I turned down another street, then another. I began to run, until I finally saw a break in the fog, a familiar intersection up ahead.

I staggered out of the haze, collapsing onto a bench at the side of the road. The fog was still there, hanging over the street like a curtain, but it didn’t seem to reach me anymore. I could see the familiar shops and cafes now, the traffic flowing smoothly, as if nothing unusual had happened. I sat there for a long time, catching my breath, trying to calm the frantic beating of my heart. Had I imagined it? It all seemed impossible, like a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.

But when I checked the time, nearly two hours had passed. Two hours of wandering in a place that shouldn’t have existed. I couldn’t explain it, and a part of me didn’t want to. I just wanted to go home and forget about it.

After the disorienting events of the day, I couldn’t bring myself to sleep. I sat at my desk, the dim glow of the lamp casting a soft halo of light over the pages of the book. I had to know what it would reveal next, no matter how unnerving. My hands shook as I opened the leather cover, bracing myself for whatever story might appear.

Slowly, the faint traces of words began to surface on the page, growing clearer with each passing moment. The text described a claustrophobic feeling, a fear of being trapped in a small space, and of the walls closing in. It talked about the sensation of suffocating, the inability to breathe, and the irrational certainty that the space itself was shrinking. The fear was so vividly described that I could almost feel the walls pressing in around me.

I closed the book abruptly, my pulse quickening. I stood up and began pacing the room, trying to shake off the creeping sensation of unease.

But then I noticed something strange. As I passed by the wall near my bed, I thought I saw it move, just a subtle, almost imperceptible shift, like a breath. I turned quickly, staring at the spot, but it was still, silent. It had to be my imagination. I was letting the book get to me, feeding into my own anxieties.

I tried to calm myself down, telling myself that it was all in my head. But when I stepped closer, I felt a soft vibration, almost like a heartbeat. I reached out and placed my hand against the wall. It was warm. Too warm. And there was a subtle give to the surface, like it wasn’t quite solid.

I jerked my hand back, my breath coming in short gasps. I backed away, my eyes fixed on the wall. It pulsed again, and this time, I was sure of it. It was moving, expanding outward ever so slightly, then contracting again. The room seemed to grow smaller, the air thicker, as though the walls were pressing in from all sides.

Desperation clawed at my mind. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and approached the wall, gripping the handle with trembling fingers. If there was something wrong with the wall, I needed to see it for myself. I pressed the blade against the surface and dragged it downward, tearing through the wallpaper.

Beneath the surface, a dark substance oozed out... a thick, viscous fluid that glistened under the dim light. The wall itself seemed to throb, like an open wound, and I could see a network of veins coursing just below the surface, pulsating with a dark fluid that seemed to breathe along with the room. I stumbled back, horrified by the sight, as the walls seemed to bulge inward, suffocating me with their closeness.

The room grew warmer, the air stagnant and heavy. I could barely think, barely breathe. I backed toward the door, desperate to escape.

I flung the door open and fled out into the hallway, gasping for air. The corridor outside was cool, blessedly still, and I collapsed against the opposite wall, my breath uneven. I didn’t know how long I sat there, trembling, my mind racing to make sense of what I had just seen. When I finally summoned the courage to look back into the apartment, the walls appeared normal, solid, undisturbed. The tear in the wallpaper was gone.

I eventually went to sleep, although I barely slept that night.

The morning light filtered through the curtains. The book sat closed on the desk, its leather cover cracked and worn. I had almost convinced myself not to open it again, but my mind kept returning to the feeling of the wall under my fingers, pulsing with a life of its own. I needed answers, and I was sure they wouldn't come from the pages of that cursed book.

I made my way out of the apartment and headed back to where all this had started: the old bookstore, Lost Pages. I walked through the crowded streets, the noise of the city buzzing in the background, but it all felt distant. As I approached the narrow alleyway, a sense of dread gnawed at me. I had to find the bookstore, but when I reached the spot where I had first stumbled upon Lost Pages, there was nothing there.

The alleyway was narrow and cluttered with old crates and garbage bins, but no bookstore. There wasn’t even a sign that a shop had ever existed there. I searched the walls, running my fingers over the worn bricks as if I could somehow find a hidden doorway. I called out into the empty space, my voice echoing back at me. The truth hit me like a punch to the gut, Lost Pages was gone. Or perhaps it had never existed in the first place.

I stumbled back out onto the main street, my heart pounding. If the bookstore wasn’t real, then what did that mean for the book? I needed someone else to see it. Someone who could tell me if I was going crazy or if there was something genuinely unnatural about the book.

There was only one person I could think of who might take me seriously, my old friend, Emily. She was the kind of person who always had an open mind, who never dismissed things out of hand. We hadn't been close in recent years, but I hoped that she would still be willing to help.

When I reached her apartment, I hesitated before knocking. My hand hovered in the air for a moment before I finally rapped on the door. She answered with a look of surprise, her expression softening when she recognized me.

""Daniel? It’s been a while,"" she said, a mix of curiosity and concern in her voice.

I forced a smile, though it felt brittle. ""I know, and I’m sorry to show up out of the blue like this. I… I need your help with something.""

She invited me inside, and we sat down at her small kitchen table. The book was heavy in my hands as I set it down in front of her, opening to the first blank page. Emily looked at the book, then back at me, a puzzled expression crossing her face.

""It's just an old book,"" she said, flipping through the pages. ""There’s nothing written here.""

My stomach sank. ""No, there was something. There were words on the pages… detailed descriptions, almost like it was reading my thoughts.""

Emily’s brow furrowed as she closed the book and looked at me with a mix of sympathy and doubt. ""Daniel, I’m not saying you’re lying, but… are you sure you weren’t imagining it? Maybe you’re just under a lot of stress, and...""

I interrupted her, my voice rising. ""No! I saw it! The words were there, and then things started happening, things that I read in the book. It’s like… it’s like it’s manifesting my fears.""

Emily’s expression softened, but I could see the skepticism in her eyes. ""Okay, let’s just take a breath. Maybe we can figure this out together. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, I’m here for you.""

I wanted to believe her, but the pit of dread inside me only deepened. Emily had always been calm and rational, but now that calmness felt like dismissal. I took the book back, clutching it to my chest as I left her apartment.

The doubt crept into my mind, whispering that maybe she was right, maybe I was just losing my grip on reality. But as I walked back to my apartment, a sense of wrongness clung to me. It was as though the world itself had shifted just slightly, the people passing by seemed distant, their expressions vacant. And when I tried to engage with someone, a stranger at a café, a cashier at the grocery store, their responses were delayed... off.

I reached my building, every step feeling heavier than the last. I glanced at the book tucked under my arm. Its pages felt cold, as though it were somehow absorbing the life from the world around me.

The weight of Emily’s skepticism hung over me like a dark cloud, intensifying my anxiety. As night fell, my apartment seemed even more stifling than usual. The silence pressed in from all sides, broken only by the ticking of the clock on the wall. The book lay closed on my desk, but I felt its presence, almost as if it were calling to me. I resisted the urge to open it again, but my mind kept drifting back to the previous entries, replaying the details over and over.

I tried to distract myself, scrolling aimlessly through my phone and flipping through TV channels, but nothing could hold my attention. A deep sense of unease had settled in, and no matter how much I tried to convince myself otherwise, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was just around the corner.

Then, the phone rang.

The sudden sound startled me, my heart skipping a beat. I glanced at the clock, 11:34 PM. Who would be calling at this hour? The number on the screen was unfamiliar, but something compelled me to answer. I lifted the phone to my ear, and all I heard was static, a low, continuous hiss.

""Hello?"" I said tentatively, but there was no response. Only static, and then, faintly, as if from far away, I thought I heard my name,  distorted and warping through the static.

""Hello?"" I repeated, my voice growing uneasy.

There was a faint click, and then the static stopped. For a moment, the line was dead silent, and I was about to hang up when a voice emerged from the quiet, soft and familiar. It was my grandmother's voice. The realization hit me like a punch to the gut; she had passed away over a decade ago.

""Daniel,"" she said, her voice clear yet hollow ,""Remember the story I used to tell you?""

My breath caught in my throat. I had no words, only a growing sense of dread. She had always told me bedtime stories as a child, comforting me when I was scared of the dark.

""I’m here, Daniel,"" the voice continued, but it was beginning to distort, warping into something that no longer sounded quite human. It was as if multiple voices were overlapping, speaking in unison, and none of them belonged to her anymore.

The phone slipped from my trembling hand and clattered onto the floor. I stumbled back, my skin prickling with cold sweat.

I forced myself to pick up the phone and check the call log. The number was still there, but when I tried to call it back, the line was disconnected.

With shaking hands, I reached for the book. I knew I shouldn’t open it again, that I should throw it away or burn it, but the need for answers... no, for some kind of explanation... was overwhelming. I opened the book to a random page, and there it was, an entry written in neat, faded script:

""A fear of the past reaching out to the present. The voice of a loved one long gone, breaking the silence of the night.""

I closed the book and slid it to the far edge of the desk, but the unease lingered, crawling over my skin like static.

The next morning, I called Emily. The phone rang and rang, but there was no answer. I tried again, and still, only the monotonous drone of the ringing met my ears. A heavy knot formed in my chest, tightening with every unanswered call.

I texted her, then tried calling some other friends, just to hear someone’s voice. Nothing. Not a single response. It was as though my messages were being cast into a void, swallowed up without leaving a trace.

Panic began to creep in. I needed to see Emily in person, to confirm that everything was normal. I drove over to her apartment, but when I reached her door and knocked, there was no response.

I knocked harder, then pounded. Still, nothing.

I tried the doorbell. No answer. It was as if the entire building had gone silent. I pressed my ear to the door, listening for any sound, any sign of life. There was only the faint hum of the distant traffic, the muted ticking of a nearby clock.

I went to the building's manager to see if Emily was home. His face was blank when I asked him about her. He scratched his head and said, ""Emily… Are you sure you have the right building?"" He stared at me like I was some stranger speaking a different language.

""She lives here,"" I insisted, feeling a mixture of fear and anger rising within me. ""I've been to her apartment before.""

He shook his head slowly. ""Sorry, but I've worked here for years, and I don’t recall anyone named Emily living here."" His tone was indifferent, almost dismissive.

It was impossible. I had visited Emily yesterday. It had to be a mistake or a sick joke.

As I left the building, a chill ran down my spine. The streets outside seemed oddly empty, with fewer cars and people than I remembered. I wandered aimlessly, trying to shake off the sense of abandonment that gnawed at my gut.

The world around me felt thinner, like it was losing its substance, becoming a shadow of itself. I reached for my phone again, frantically scrolling through my contacts. Some people were missing from my contact list. Friends, acquaintances, even family members... gone.

I drove to my parents’ house, the roads growing eerily quiet as I neared the familiar neighborhood. When I arrived, the house stood empty, the windows dark and lifeless. I pounded on the door, shouting their names, but there was no answer. The door swung open, revealing a barren, dust-covered interior that looked as though it hadn’t been lived in for years.

I stumbled back, my thoughts a chaotic swirl. I tried dialing my parents’ number, but the call didn’t go through. There was only a hollow voice saying, ""The number you have dialed is not in service."" It repeated the message again and again, as if mocking me.

My world was shrinking. The people I had known, the places that had been so familiar, were slipping away. It felt as if reality itself was erasing them, leaving me isolated in an increasingly empty world. I tried visiting an old friend who lived in the next town over. When he answered the door, his face was pale and vacant, his eyes unfocused as though he was half-asleep.

""Do… do you remember me?"" I asked, my voice trembling with desperation. ""We used to hang out all the time. Don’t you remember?""

He blinked at me, his gaze unfocused. ""You shouldn’t have opened the book,"" he murmured, his voice flat, as if reciting something from memory.

""What?"" I stepped back, my skin crawling. ""What did you say?""

His expression remained unchanged, his lips moving soundlessly before he repeated the phrase, ""You should have never opened the book."" His eyes seemed to glaze over as he spoke, and I felt a coldness settle over me, a dreadful certainty that I was slipping further away from the world I once knew.

I left in a daze, my mind racing with questions, but no answers came. As I drove back to my apartment, the streets were emptier than ever. It felt like a dream, a nightmare, that I was unable to wake up from, and all I could do was keep driving, hoping against hope that someone, anyone, would still be there when I returned.

By the time I reached my apartment, night had already fallen, and an oppressive silence seemed to blanket the building. I hesitated before unlocking the door, a nagging sensation that I was walking into a trap. But I had nowhere else to go. It felt like the entire world had been swallowed by darkness, and this was the last patch of ground that still existed.

As I stepped inside, the air felt colder than usual, and a strange quiet settled over the place. I flicked the light switch, but nothing happened. I tried another one, but the bulbs stayed dark.

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

Standing across the street, directly facing my window, was a pale figure. I could feel its gaze, heavy and unyielding, boring into me from across the street.

The figure wasn’t moving. It wore a pale, featureless face, blank and devoid of expression, its surface reflecting the streetlights in a way that made it seem almost translucent, and then it disappeared.

Over the next few days, the figure would return. Sometimes, it appeared outside the living room window, other times at the back, near the alley.

As time went on, the figure crept closer and closer, until one night, I found it standing directly outside my bedroom window, its pale face peering in through the glass. I froze, my breath hitching in my throat as I locked eyes with it, or what would have been its eyes, if it had any. There was nothing there, only a smooth, featureless surface that somehow managed to exude a sense of malevolence.

And then, it was gone.

The days blurred together after the encounter with the pale figure. Sleep became a rare occurrence, and when I did manage to close my eyes, I found myself trapped in a maze of dark corridors and whispering shadows. Each time I woke, I half-expected to see the figure standing over my bed.

One night, I found the book resting on the kitchen counter, its pages fluttering open as if caught by an invisible breeze. The words faded into view, and I read them with a sense of grim inevitability:

""The fear that everything around you is just a reflection of your mind, that reality is bending to your will… or your despair.""

I shivered as the room seemed to grow colder, the lights dimming as though a shadow had passed over them. I grabbed the book and threw it across the room in frustration, the leather cover thudding against the wall. It landed with a heavy slap, lying there with its pages fanned out. For a brief moment, I thought that might be the end of it. But then the lights flickered, and the familiar chill settled over the apartment. There was a pressure in the air, a sensation like being watched.

I turned and the walls seemed to bend inward, as if being drawn toward a single point in the living room. I watched, frozen in place, as a shape began to form... a dark, indistinct mass that seemed to pulse and shift like a living shadow. It was as though the very fabric of reality was unraveling before my eyes.

Then the shadow parted, and the figure emerged, stepping forward with a slow, deliberate grace. Its form was more defined now, almost human, yet there was an unnatural fluidity to its movements. It seemed to float just above the ground, its limbs swaying as if caught in a current.

The figure's face remained featureless, but its presence was unmistakably more powerful, as if it had grown stronger with every fear I had confronted. And as it moved closer, I realized something... it wasn’t just feeding on my fear, it was shaping itself based on the darkest parts of my mind.

It was then that the truth began to settle in, a cold, unyielding realization that clawed its way into my thoughts. The figure wasn't an external force; it was a manifestation of the book, of my own mind. The book wasn’t just documenting my fears, it was bringing them to life.

I tried to steady myself, to gather my thoughts, but the room seemed to pulse in time with the figure’s approach. The air grew heavier, and a low hum filled the space, vibrating through the walls. The figure stopped a few feet away from me, its pale, featureless head tilting to the side as if studying me.

Then, it spoke. Not in a voice, but through a thought that seemed to echo in my mind. It was a presence that filled the room, a darkness that whispered my name.

""You brought me here.""

The figure stepped even closer.

I steadied my breathing, forcing myself to confront the figure before me. The pale entity stood motionless, its eyes hollow and its form flickering as if caught between two worlds. Its presence radiated a bone-deep cold, a chill that seemed to seep into the air itself.

""I know what you are,"" I said, my voice shaking but growing stronger with each word. ""You are my fears, my doubts, my anxieties, everything I've tried to push away. But you are not stronger than me.""

The pale figure’s expression remained unchanged, but I sensed a shift in the darkness surrounding us. It seemed to pulse, reacting to my words, as though the very fabric of the nightmare was beginning to fray at the edges.

""I accept that these fears are a part of me,"" I continued, ""but they don’t define who I am. I am more than my darkest thoughts, more than the terror that tries to consume me!""

For a moment, the figure stood as if frozen, its form wavering, becoming less solid. The air grew lighter, as though a weight had been lifted. The figure’s shape blurred, its outline dissolving into a haze of grey smoke. As the last remnants of its form began to dissipate, the whispering ceased, replaced by an almost deafening silence. I watched as the entity melted away into nothingness, leaving only faint traces of mist that quickly faded.

As I looked around, my surroundings began to change. The walls of my apartment shifted back to their normal dimensions, the suffocating darkness lifting. The oppressive silence gave way to the familiar hum of city life outside my window, a welcome reminder that I had returned to reality. I could hear the faint sound of traffic in the distance and the steady rhythm of my own breathing.

I cautiously reached for my phone and all my contacts were there.

I sent a message to Emily: ""Hey. It's me.""

I was unsure if she'd even respond, but almost immediately, the screen lit up with her reply.

""Oh my God. Where have you been? Are you okay? People have been looking for you for weeks. You just... vanished.""

A wave of relief crashed into me. I was back. I was real. Emily remembered me.

Tears welled in my eyes as my phone buzzed again. Another message from Emily.

""Your parents filed a missing person report. We thought the worst. No one knew where you were. They checked your apartment... you were gone.""

I sank to the floor. Somehow, impossibly, I’d returned from wherever I’d been, but the world had kept going without me.

The apartment no longer felt like a nightmarish labyrinth. It was just my home, plain and familiar, with the clutter of books and papers on the coffee table, the faint smell of coffee lingering in the air. I sank onto the couch, while holding the book. It was lighter than I remembered, as if some unseen burden had been lifted from its pages.

As I sat there, a thought crept into my mind. This experience wasn’t something I could forget, nor should I. The book was more than a cursed object; it was a mirror that had forced me to confront what I had buried deep within myself. In some strange, unsettling way, it had helped me. It had shown me that facing the darkness was the only way to let the light back in.

I decided to keep the book, not as a relic of horror but as a reminder... a reminder of the darkness I had faced and the strength it took to overcome it. I placed it on my shelf, where it sat among other leather-bound volumes. From a distance, it looked ordinary, unremarkable, as though it was just another book in my collection. But I knew that if I ever needed to remember the lessons I had learned, the book would be there, waiting to remind me of what I had endured and conquered.

As the days passed, life seemed to return to normal. My anxiety didn’t vanish overnight, but it no longer had the same power over me. I had confronted the fears that had once ruled my life, and I had come out on the other side stronger. The book remained a part of me, a silent witness to the darkness I had faced and a testament to the fact that even the deepest fears could be [challenged.](https://www.reddit.com/user/CreepyStoriesJR/comments/1ilh8mp/creepystoriesjr_story_list/)",2,1749930111.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

CHAPTER 1

⸻

SCENE 1

INT. GYM – NIGHT

(A dimly lit gym. The scent of sweat and leather lingers in the air. The TV hums softly in the background, playing an old fight— Adrian Reyes in his prime. Fast. Sharp. Precise. The commentators’ voices murmur about his dominance.)

(Adrian, hunched over on a bench, watches blankly. His hands—wrapped, fists loose—rest on his knees. His phone buzzes on the bench beside him. He ignores it.)

(A second buzz—longer. A call. He exhales through his nose, grabs the phone.)

⸻

INTERCUT – PHONE CALL

COACH (V.O.) (gruff, impatient)
“How long you gonna keep this up, huh? The gym’s turning into a damn tomb. You were the best fighter to come through here, Adrian. You still got people watching, hoping. But if you keep this up? You’re gonna lose them too.”

ADRIAN (flatly)
“Not my problem.”

COACH (V.O.) (scoffs, then—softens a bit)
“You’re still grieving.” (beat) “I get it. But you can’t stay lost forever, kid.”

(Adrian doesn’t answer. He grabs the remote, flips the channel. A news broadcast flickers on—storm warnings.)

TV REPORTER (V.O.) (distant, muffled)
“Heavy rain and strong winds expected to hit by midnight tomorrow—”

(Knock. At the gym door. Sharp. Urgent.)

COACH (V.O.) (noticing the silence)
“You still there?”

ADRIAN (distracted, standing up)
“Yeah.” (beat) “I gotta go.”

(He hangs up, moves toward the entrance. Another knock—harder this time. He unlocks the door. A girl (18, breathless, scared) stumbles in, glancing over her shoulder.)

GIRL (panting, whispering)
“They’re coming.”

(Outside, shadows move. Three men. Tony (45, weathered, built like someone who’s seen too much) stands at the front. His eyes widen when he sees Adrian—just for a second. Then, he hides it.)

(Adrian studies him. There’s something familiar. A ghost from another life.)

TONY (calm, measured, but firm)
“We’re not here for you, man. We want the girl.”

(Adrian’s eyes flick to her—her fear says everything. He doesn’t move. Doesn’t speak. The tension thickens. Then—one of the thugs, impatient, lunges.)

⸻

SCENE 2 – FIGHT SEQUENCE

(The first thug swings. A right hand whipping through the air, aiming for Adrian’s side. Adrian sees it coming. He leans just out of range—slips through—before throwing a sharp, crisp right cross. His knuckles cut through the attack like a blade through cloth. The thug’s head snaps back. Dazed. Staggering. Done.)

(The second thug moves. A knife glints under the low light. He lunges. But Adrian was already there. Something in him—a buried instinct—clicks into place. The world slows. He reads the movement. Adjusts.)

(Just as the knife aims for him, he pivots—just outside the range. A breath away from steel. The thug’s momentum betrays him. And in the same breath—)

(Adrian retaliates. His fist drives into the man’s liver. A sharp, broken gasp. The thug crumbles forward, body folding over. Adrian doesn’t hesitate—he follows through with a brutal uppercut. A flash of bone and teeth. Done. The body slumps.)

(Tony doesn’t move. He just watches. Not with panic—but something deeper. Recognition. Disbelief.)

(A moment. Then, he exhales. Almost a laugh. Shaking his head.)

TONY (low, almost to himself)
“No way…”

(Adrian steps forward, fists still tight.)

ADRIAN (low, cold)
“You done?”

(A pause. Then, Tony does something the others wouldn’t—he raises his hands. A truce.)

TONY (calm, controlled)
“I ain’t here to fight you, Reyes.” (beat, quieter) “Didn’t even think you were still alive.”

(Adrian doesn’t answer. His fists slowly relax.)

(Behind him, the girl finally speaks—soft, cautious.)

GIRL (hesitant)
“How do you know them?”

(Adrian unwraps his fists, his gaze dropping to his scarred, bruised hands. His past staring back at him. A slow exhale.)

ADRIAN (quiet, almost to himself)
“Ektor… their leader.” (beat) “Someone I used to know… a long time ago.”

(FADE TO BLACK.)

⸻

SCENE 3 – AFTERMATH

(EXT. ALLEY – NIGHT – The storm has picked up. Wind howls through the empty street. Adrian walks out of the gym, carrying the girl. She’s light, barely conscious. Tony watches him but doesn’t follow.)

TONY (calling out)
“She’s not your problem, Reyes.”

(Adrian doesn’t stop. He flicks his hair back, exhales. Doesn’t even turn around.)

ADRIAN (quiet, but firm)
“I don’t want to.”

(Tony watches him disappear into the storm. His jaw clenches. He mutters under his breath.)

TONY
“Still the same damn guy…”

(FADE OUT.)


CHAPTER 2

⸻

INT. ADRIAN’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

The place is dimly lit, cold. The kind of place where silence lingers too long.

Adrian carries Malia through the dark hallway, careful, but not gentle.

The living room is barely lived in. A worn-out couch, a coffee table cluttered with old papers, and a single cracked lamp casting long shadows.

He lays Malia down on the couch. For a moment, he studies her— unconscious, bruised, barely breathing.

Adrian exhales sharply. Pulls out his phone.

He hesitates. Just a second. Then dials.

The line rings. Once. Twice.

Then—

TESS (V.O.)
(muffled, cautious)
“…Hello?”

ADRIAN
(low, firm)
“I need you.”

Silence.

Then, Tess inhales sharply.

TESS (V.O.)
(uneven)
“What—how the—Adrian? You—?!”

She stumbles over her words. Disbelief. Shock.

Adrian doesn’t have time for it. He cuts her off.

ADRIAN
“I’ll send you the address. Just get here.”

Tess says nothing. But the silence crackles.

Then—

TESS (V.O.)
(soft, uncertain)
“…I’m coming.”

CLICK. Call ends.

Adrian leans against the counter, running a hand down his face.

⸻

INT. ADRIAN’S APARTMENT – LATER

The front door creaks open.

Tess steps inside, eyes scanning the place—then land on him.

She stiffens.

Adrian, standing in the dim light, looks exactly like he did before he “died.”

Tess swallows, then exhales through her nose.

TESS
(flat)
“You look like shit.”

Adrian snorts. “Nice to see you too.”

Tess doesn’t bite. She drops her bag on the counter and moves toward Malia.

She kneels beside her, assessing. Professional. Detached.

Adrian watches. Leaning back. Arms crossed.

A beat.

Then—

ADRIAN
(gruff)
“Didn’t think you’d actually come.”

Tess doesn’t look up.

TESS
“Yeah, well. It’s what I do.”

She ties off a bandage, finally meeting his gaze.

TESS
(quiet, measured)
“I thought you were dead, Adrian.”

Adrian tilts his head.

ADRIAN
“Yeah. A lot of people did.”

Tess’ jaw clenches.

TESS
“You don’t get to be smug about it.”

Silence. Heavy. Old wounds never closed.

Then—

TESS
“And now you’re tangled up in some shit again?”

Adrian exhales. A slow slick of his hair back.

ADRIAN
(under his breath)
“Here we go again.”

Tess glares.

TESS
“You think this is funny? You think—”

A quiet shift. A breath.

They both turn—

Malia stirs.

Her eyes flutter open, adjusting to the dim light.

She shifts slightly, head heavy—then freezes.

Adrian stands near the window, back turned.

The dim light cuts across his broad shoulders, the curve of his back.

Something tugs at her memory.

A flash. A moment.

⸻

FLASHBACK – EXT. OUTSIDE THE GYM – NIGHT

FISTS FLYING. A fight. Fast. Brutal.

A liver blow—clean. An uppercut—brutal.

Adrian, in the present, shifts his stance.

⸻

FLASHBACK – ANOTHER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE

Someone else. Familiar. The same movements.

A liver blow—clean. An uppercut—brutal.A turn.

A voice.
 
Figure(unknown)
(Firm)

“You’re safe now.”

⸻

SMASH CUT BACK TO PRESENT

Malia’s breath catches. She stares at Adrian.

She knows this feeling. She knows him.

But—

MALIA
(quietly, to herself)
“…That’s impossible.”

⸻

A beat. The air in the room shifts.

Malia swallows, straightens up.

She blinks at the two of them—Adrian, Tess.

A moment of silence. Then—

MALIA
(slow, casual)
“Anyway. I’m Malia.”

She exhales, studying them.

MALIA
“What’s up with you guys?”

Adrian’s eyes sharpen.

A slow, easy movement—slicking his hair back again.

And—fade to black.

⸻

END OF CHAPTER
CHAPTER 3

EXT. GYM – EARLY MORNING

The night still lingers, thick and suffocating. The parking lot is empty, bathed in the dull orange glow of flickering streetlights.

A cigarette ember flares weakly. TONY, hunched against the gym’s outer wall, flicks his lighter again. Click. Click. Nothing.

He mutters under his breath, shaking it. Another flick. A spark. A small flame.

Then—headlights.

A black sedan glides into the lot, moving like a shadow, its tires whispering against the pavement.

Tony’s hands still. The flame wavers.

The car stops. The engine hums for a second before cutting off.

The driver’s door clicks open.

A figure steps out—EKTOR.

Tony lowers the cigarette from his lips. His fingers twitch slightly, but he doesn’t look up.

EKTOR

(low, measured)
Did you let her go?

Tony exhales slowly, his breath barely visible in the cold.

TONY

I… I didn’t know—

Before he can finish, a hand clamps around his throat.

Tony is yanked up, his feet leaving the ground. The cigarette drops, landing beside his shoe.

EKTOR

You didn’t know what?

Tony’s breath is choked off, his hands clawing at Ektor’s grip.

TONY

(gasping, desperate)
I didn’t know he would be here…

A sharp pause. Ektor’s eyes narrow.

EKTOR

Who?

Tony struggles, his voice barely a whisper.

TONY

Reyes.

Ektor’s jaw tightens. His grip loosens—just enough for Tony to collapse to the ground, coughing violently.

EKTOR

(low, testing the name)
Adrian Reyes…

Tony’s hands tremble slightly as he glances up.

Then—laughter.

Sharp. Brief. Maniacal.

Ektor lets it hang in the air before cutting it off just as suddenly. He adjusts his tie, his movements precise, composed.

He turns, walking toward the car.

Tony watches in silence. His breath uneven.

The trunk opens.

Ektor reaches in—and pulls out a sword.

A black broadsword, its edge glinting under the streetlights, faint red engravings running down the blade.

Tony’s eyes widen.

FLASH CUT TO:

A GRUESOME BATTLE.

BAM! Fists cracking against ribs. Blood-slicked sand. Bodies dropping.

A younger Adrian Reyes, drenched in sweat and blood, stands amidst the chaos, the same sword in his hand.

Blood drips onto the ground. The sound of brutal impact.

Adrian, breathing heavy, his eyes burning.

CUT BACK TO PRESENT.

Ektor studies the sword, the corner of his mouth curling upward.

EKTOR

(softly, to himself)
No one leaves.

Tony flinches.

His breath is shaky as he stammers out—

TONY

Please—just leave him alone! He’s done with all this! Ten years, Ektor! Just let it go!

Ektor doesn’t respond. His jaw tightens—a fraction of a second, a barely perceptible reaction.

Then—he steps forward.

Without warning, he grabs Tony’s wrist and slams it onto the car’s hood.

Tony barely has time to react before the sword is driven through his palm.

TONY
(screaming, desperate)

Ektor yanks the blade free with practiced ease.

Tony collapses, cradling his bleeding hand.

Ektor steps back, watching.

Then, his voice, calm. Absolute.

EKTOR

Write it.

Tony trembles, barely able to move. But the command is absolute. He crawls toward the gym’s wooden welcome board.

Ektor watches, his expression unreadable.

Tony hesitates, his fingers shaking. He turns back, expecting another command.

Ektor’s voice is low, but firm.

EKTOR

Arrástralos al infierno.

Slowly, painfully, Tony writes it in blood.

Ektor watches him finish. Then, without another word, turns and walks away.

The black sedan pulls out, vanishing into the night.

INT. ADRIAN’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

A soft yellow light glows from a corner lamp. The air is quiet — still thick with the weight of what happened earlier. ADRIAN stands by the wall, arms crossed. TESS leans against the counter. MALIA is curled up on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, half-watching them.

MALIA
(looking between them)
Sooo… you two were a thing, huh?

TESS raises an eyebrow. ADRIAN just stares at her blankly.

TESS
You could say that.

ADRIAN
Depends who you ask.

MALIA
(smirking)
I asked both. Neither said “no.”

TESS hides a small laugh behind her hand.

MALIA
(sly)
He’s been broody since I met him. You must’ve really messed him up.

TESS
Trust me — he was like that before I got there.

ADRIAN
I’m right here, you know.

MALIA
And yet you’re saying nothing. Classic Adrian.

TESS gives Malia a curious look.

TESS
How long have you known him?

MALIA
Long enough to know he hates explaining himself.

ADRIAN
Some things don’t need explaining.

MALIA
Yeah, see? He thinks that’s deep.

They all share a small laugh — the first real one in the room tonight. The tension starts to ease. Malia settles deeper into the couch.

MALIA
Honestly, you’re good for him. He talks more when you’re around. A little.

TESS glances at Adrian, smirking.

TESS
That’s progress.

ADRIAN
Malia, don’t you have… I don’t know, sleep to catch up on?

MALIA
(sweetly)
You kicking me out?

ADRIAN
Yes.

MALIA
(sighs, grinning)
Fine. I’ll give you two privacy. But if someone starts crying, I’m coming back.

MALIA stretches and gets up from the couch. She yawns, glancing between TESS and ADRIAN.

TESS
(smiling)
Good night, Malia.

ADRIAN
Get some rest.

MALIA gives them both a playful salute and disappears down the hallway. The bedroom door clicks softly shut.

A silence lingers. ADRIAN grabs his coat from the wall hook. He hesitates, then turns to TESS.

ADRIAN
You wanna take a walk?

TESS
(suspicious)
A walk?

ADRIAN
Yeah. No drama. Just… talk.

She narrows her eyes slightly, but nods.

TESS
Sure.
Lead the way, Lazarus.

⸻

EXT. STREET – NIGHT

The city is quiet. Streetlights buzz faintly. ADRIAN and TESS walk side by side, the silence between them calm but weighted.

TESS
So what do I even say to someone who was dead?

ADRIAN
You start with “Hi.”
Then “What the hell.”

TESS
I did that already.

Beat.

TESS
You were gone, Adrian.
You let everyone believe it.

ADRIAN
I didn’t fake it.
It just happened that way.

TESS
How?

ADRIAN
I got pulled out. Nearly didn’t make it.

TESS
Pulled out by who?

ADRIAN
Marko.

TESS
Marko? That guy’s still alive?

ADRIAN
Barely.
He handed me off to someone else.

TESS
Who?

ADRIAN
Boxing coach. Quiet man. He kept me alive.

TESS
What happened to you?

ADRIAN
Coma. For a year.
Then I trained. Rebuilt.

TESS
And now?

ADRIAN
Now I run a gym. With him.

TESS
(stopping)
Wait—what?

ADRIAN
Yeah. Me. Gym.
It’s a thing.

TESS
You’re telling me you died, came back, grew a beard, and started running a gym?

ADRIAN
More or less.

She shakes her head, baffled.

TESS
Where even is this place?

ADRIAN
Few blocks. Come see it.

TESS
You know what? Yeah.
Let’s see the life you built while I cried over your grave.

EXT. GYM – NIGHT

The lot is silent. Rainwater reflects dull streetlights. ADRIAN and TESS approach from across the street, footsteps slow and steady.

                        TESS
            What the hell...?

She stops.

ADRIAN follows her gaze — the welcome board.

A BLACK SWORD is driven deep into the wood. Blood smeared across the surface.

Above it, carved in rough, dripping strokes:

            ARRÁSTRALOS AL INFIERNO

(""Drag them to hell."")

Adrian stares. His expression doesn't change — but something behind his eyes shifts.

                        ADRIAN
                (quiet)
            He was here.

They don’t touch the blade. Not yet.

Adrian moves to the door and unlocks it.

---

INT. GYM – CONTINUOUS

The gym is dimly lit. Still. Silent.

Inside, everything’s where it should be — except for the thin, dark smear across the floor.

A trail.

Adrian stiffens. TESS follows, quiet behind him.

                        ADRIAN
            Stay close.

---

INT. GYM – BACK HALL – MOMENTS LATER

TONY is slumped against the back wall. His face is pale. Blood seeps from a crude towel wrapped around his hand.

                        ADRIAN
            Tony!

He drops to his knees beside him. TESS follows and crouches.

Tony groans faintly.

                        TONY
            You still walk heavy...  
            That was always your tell.

                        ADRIAN
            You’re lucky I didn’t bring a shovel.

                        TESS
                (checking the hand)
            Went clean through the palm. He’s lost a lot of blood.  
            If we don’t stop it, shock might take him.

                        ADRIAN
            Ektor?

                        TONY
                (nods weakly)
            Wasn’t even trying to kill me. Just wanted...  
            You to see it.

                        TESS
            He needs pressure and fluids — fast.

Tony groans as she adjusts the towel and tightens it.

                        TONY
            You came back.  
            Should’ve stayed gone, Reyes.

                        ADRIAN
            You think I had a choice?

                        TONY
            You always had a choice.  
            You just never picked peace.

His head slumps slightly. His breathing shallows.

                        TESS
            He’s not gone — just blacked out.

Adrian exhales. Stands up.

---

EXT. GYM – FRONT – NIGHT

Adrian steps out into the cold. The sword is still jammed into the welcome board.

He dials a number.

---

INTERCUT – PHONE CALL

A burner phone rings on a cluttered desk. A hand picks it up. No voice — just breath.

                        ADRIAN
            We’ve got a problem.

                        MARKO (V.O.)
            Talk to me.

                        ADRIAN
            Ektor came by.  
            Left a message.

A pause.

                        MARKO (V.O.)
            You want me to move?

                        ADRIAN
            Tell the others.  
            We’re back in it.

(beat)

                        ADRIAN
            We’re in the gym.  
            Tony’s hurt — bad.

(another pause)

                        ADRIAN
            Send people. Take care of him.

He glances over his shoulder, then back into the night.

                        ADRIAN
            And be ready.

(beat)

                        ADRIAN
            I’ll call you any minute.

He ends the call. The night hangs heavy around him.

---

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. GYM – EARLY MORNING

The glass door clicks shut behind him.

Adrian steps into the cold. No wind. No sound. The sky's just waiting to open up.

The black sword still juts from the welcome board.

He walks straight to it.

Doesn’t hesitate.

He presses his already-cut hand against the flat edge.

His blood mixes with the old, dried blood crusted into the steel.

Then, forehead to metal, he lowers his head.

Just for a second.

---

FLASHBACK – INT. COLLAPSING BUILDING – NIGHT (YEARS AGO)

A concrete hell.

Cracked beams. Flames flickering at the edges. Smoke choking the light.

The place is filled with chaos — people fighting with fists, blades, axes. Screaming. Pure disorder.

Adrian, younger, shirtless, sweat and blood running down his back, **drags a massive black broadsword** behind him. Sparks fly where it scrapes stone.

Across the crumbling hall: **EKTOR**.

White sword. Calm eyes. Bare chest already bleeding from somewhere.

They walk toward each other like they don’t hear the world around them.

They clash.

Steel against steel — no rhythm, just hate.

Then Adrian **slams his blade sideways**, a full horizontal slash — and **buries it across Ektor’s chest**, shoulder to ribs.

Blood bursts across the air.

Ektor stumbles.

Adrian breathes — heavy. Not victorious. Just still standing.

---

SMASH BACK TO:

---

EXT. GYM – PRESENT

Adrian lifts his head.

Pulls the sword from the board.

From the alley — **seven figures step into view**.

No shouting. No warning.

They recognize him. He doesn’t care who they are.

                        ADRIAN
            Come on.

            I’ve got things to do.

They rush.

---

FIGHT SEQUENCE

The FIRST man comes swinging a chain — fast and wide.

Adrian ducks low and **drives an elbow into his ribs**, then follows with a **hilt-smash to the face**. Out cold.

SECOND guy — crowbar — steps in fast.

Adrian takes a hit to the shoulder but doesn’t stop. He wraps the man’s arm, twists it — **snaps the elbow** — and **runs the sword straight through his gut**.

The **THIRD** lunges forward — blade-first.

Adrian parries just in time and pivots — moving behind the **FOURTH**, and **drives the sword through his thigh**, pinning him to the concrete.

A scream rips out.

Adrian turns — just in time to take a **punch across the jaw** from the **FIFTH attacker**.

He stumbles, and before he can recover — a short sword slices across his back, tearing clean through his shirt.

He gasps — breath shallow.

Now both **THIRD** and **FIFTH** charge at once.

Adrian plants his feet — then **jumps**.

Not high — just enough.

**Mid-air, he twists**, swinging the sword in a full arc.

The blade cuts through **THIRD’s shoulder** and **FIFTH’s chest** in one impossible turn.

They fall — writhing, screaming.

Adrian lands hard.

Breathing heavy.

Blood on his hands, his back, his mouth.

The **SIXTH** attacker — knees trembling — drops his weapon and falls to his knees.

                        SIXTH MAN
            Please—don’t—please—

Adrian doesn’t reply.

He walks up.

And **drives the sword straight through his chest**.

Fast. Clean. Over.

Only the **SEVENTH** is left.

Frozen. Eyes wide.

Adrian steps in.

                        ADRIAN
            Where’s Ektor?

                        SEVENTH MAN
            He—he didn’t say. Just told us to slow you down.

                        (beat)

            Keep you busy.

Adrian doesn’t blink.

Then — **one motion**.

He **swipes the blade sideways**, taking the man’s head clean off.

No hesitation.

He stands there.

Just breathing.

---

Rain starts to fall.

Light. Then steady.

Adrian turns, steps into the middle of the blood-washed street.

His shirt, already torn, hangs in wet strips.

He grabs the collar and **rips it away**, tossing it aside.

What’s left:

**Ink.**

Dark, weathered **tattoos** wind across his back and down his arms.

Half-swallowed by old scars. But still visible.

Still remembered.

---

INT. GYM – GLASS DOOR – SAME

TESS stands behind the glass.

She says nothing.

She doesn’t open the door.

She just watches the man she thought was dead — standing shirtless in the rain, sword in hand, blood on the ground.

---

EXT. STREET – SAME

From the distance — ENGINES.

A few motorcycles. One black SUV.

They arrive fast — but quiet.

Men step out.

They see the street. The bodies. The sword.

And then they see **Adrian’s back**.

The tattoos.

The ink they didn’t think they’d ever see again.

One kneels.

Then another.

Then all of them.

No salute. No ceremony.

Just silence.

---

Adrian doesn’t move.

Rain rolls off his shoulders.

He lifts the sword slowly, pointing it to the sky.

His arms tremble — not from pride.

Just exhaustion.

---

Then it hits him.

His breath catches.

                        ADRIAN (V.O.)
            Malia.

He lowers the blade.

His brow tightens.

                        ADRIAN (V.O.)
            They didn’t come to kill me.

                        (beat)

            They just had to keep me out of the way.

He blinks.

His jaw clenches.

He takes one step back toward the gym—

Then another.

                        ADRIAN (V.O.)
            She’s alone.

                        (beat)

            And he knows it.

---

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. ADRIAN’S TERRACE – EARLY MORNING

The sky hangs heavy. Grey, dull. Storm swelling somewhere out of sight.

MALIA stands still, gripping the terrace railing. Her eyes roam the street below — calm but off. Too off.

Then—movement.

A shape in the alley, emerging into the morning mist.

Malia turns and rushes downstairs.

---

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE ADRIAN’S APARTMENT – MOMENTS LATER

MALIA slows to a halt.

Standing in the middle of the street is **EKTOR**. Neat. Controlled. As if he belongs there.

                        EKTOR
            Looking for someone?

Malia doesn’t move.

                        MALIA
            You should leave.

                        (steady, but not strong)
            Now.

                        EKTOR
            Or what?

            You’ll call Adrian?

His smile is small. Flat.

                        EKTOR (CONT’D)
            He’s bleeding somewhere, probably.

            That’s what he does.  
            Bleeds. Rebuilds. Repeats.

Malia clenches her jaw.

                        MALIA
            He’ll come.

                        EKTOR
            Sure. But when he does… maybe you won’t see him the same.

            You think you know who he is?

                        MALIA
            I know what he’s done.

                        EKTOR
            No. You don’t.

            Adrian and I trained together.  
            Under your father.

            And one day — Adrian killed him.

Malia stares. Doesn’t blink.

                        MALIA
            No.

                        EKTOR
            You were four.

            You don’t remember.

            But I do.

A pause.

She doesn’t argue again.

Ektor just smiles.

---

EXT. GYM – NIGHT

Rain taps gently on the concrete.

The blood is gone. The bodies are gone.

Adrian’s people — silent and practiced — cleaned everything without a word. Only the smell of metal and wet cloth remains.

ADRIAN sits on the gym steps. Shirtless. The red jacket folded beside him.  
His back is still bleeding beneath rough wraps. His sword lies across his lap.

He breathes shallowly — not from pain, but from what he knows is coming next.

TESS walks out from inside and settles beside him. She doesn’t speak.

Adrian doesn’t move — just stares at the rain.

Then… his phone buzzes.

He lifts it.

**Message — Unknown Number:**  
*79 Blackwell Street.*

Adrian stares at it. Blinks once.

            Didn’t even need the message.

                        (beat)

            This was the play from the start.

                        MARCO (V.O.)
            Where?

                        ADRIAN

                        ADRIAN
            Move.

Click.

Adrian drops the phone into his lap.

Tess watches him carefully.

                        TESS
            You’re shaking.

Adrian glances down at his own hand — slight tremble in the fingers.

                        ADRIAN
            He always finds the one thing I can’t afford to lose.

Tess doesn’t answer.

She just stays there beside him.

EXT. GYM – MOMENTS LATER

One of Adrian’s men walks up, careful in his steps.

In his hands: **a red jacket**.

Frayed collar. Torn seams. No buttons. Just history.

He offers it silently.

Adrian takes it.

                        ADRIAN
            Still fits me, huh?

He throws it on. The jacket clings to his rain-slicked skin.  
Open. Bare-chested. Inked. Bruised. But standing.

Adrian doesn’t walk off yet.

He sits back down.

On the same steps.

His sword across his lap.

Tess joins him again.

                        TESS
            You looked better in that back then.

                        ADRIAN
            I was less stabbed back then.

A flicker of a smirk between them.

                        TESS
            Are you sure you’re ready?

                        ADRIAN
            Doesn’t matter.

                        (beat)

            It’s already happening.

She leans forward, mirroring his posture. Rain soft between them.

                        TESS
            You still scare me.

                        ADRIAN
            I scare me too.

A long, gentle pause.

                        TESS
            We should go.

                        ADRIAN
            Yeah.

                        (softly)

            Just one more minute.

They sit still.

The rain washes faint streaks of blood from his forearms.

Then — Adrian slowly rises.

He lifts his **blood-stained hand**, runs it back through his soaked hair, slicking it from his face.

A long breath escapes him.

                        ADRIAN (CONT’D)
            We leave in ten.

            So get running, boys.

His crew moves immediately.

Tess stays at the door, watching him walk toward the road.

The red jacket clings like it never left.

The silence doesn’t need filling.

Adrian Reyes is moving again.

1lbh2og,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lbh2og/wife_and_expectations/,Wife and expectations,"Ok, so I’m recently married and I’m having trouble in paradise already. I feel as if my wife has the major expectations of me because her step dad did everything for her and now she expects those things of me. Particularly filling up her gas tank, packing her lunch for work, starting her car in the morning. She has a type A personality and I am pretty aloof and go with the flow kind of person. She has been getting more heated at me recently and they have been some really nasty fights that last a day or two. 

From yesterday I bought us some Burger King because she was upset from the day before that I didn’t have anything in the house to eat that wasn’t leftovers. So yesterday I told her I’ll get her a burger to make her happy because left overs can get stale. She sounded so happy over text and I was excited to have a burger and watch shitty tv with her. 

So she gets home and I’m standing in front of her car as she pulls into our driveway and I do a cute jig to make her smile. The first thing she says to me when she gets out of the car is a snarky remark about how unchivalrous I am, while pretending to be on the phone with someone as if I wasn’t there. I give her a look of unexpected shock as I thought we could eat together and I could use the burgers to apologize. She continues to walk past me and says how she’s now being condescending and starting another fight blah blah blah. 

We had a previous fight yesterday in the morning before work where she got mad at me for leaving my pillow disheveled and not entirely in its case. She has asked me before to stop doing that because I toss in my sleep a lot and things get moved around. Annoying I get it but when I wake up in the morning I don’t think about the pillows. I think about making her coffee and getting dressed for work.

As the day progresses I tell her that I don’t like the way she spoke to me and that she was being rude. She fires back that I’m not manly enough for checking her gas tank levels and that she had to get gas in a bad part of town. I used to get gas for her when she asked me but I haven’t done if for her bc I’m normally doing other things and don’t think about it. I don’t take a lot of initiative and it’s something I’m working on slowly but surely. We spoke about it before and I’m ashamed to admit that I haven’t really done anything about it since the convo in the beginning of the month. 

This morning we got into another fight because she didn’t want me near her. She told me she wanted to explain why she was so angry but I (reacted poorly) said I don’t care and that the ways she spoke to me was unacceptable and that I didn’t deserve that. Now we aren’t speaking to each other and she threw out the breakfast I made her. We had one more fight prior to this post where she said how her step dad did everything for her and how I don’t. This felt like a slap in the face as I do a bulk of the cooking and house hold chores. I do her laundry and make sure she makes and gets to her doctors appointments. Lastly, I’m not your fucking daddy in the same way I’d never tell my wife that my mommy did all this stuff for me. (Is that a double standard) 

I feel as if there are these high expectations of me and I’m frustrated that I’m not meeting them. The way she speaks to me is out of frustration as well bc she does speak to me about them but I’m not doing it. I work typically 60 hour weeks in a moderately stressful job so I’m dead tired. What I think I’m getting at is that I’m not satisfying my wife’s expectations but I feel so lost in it that I just don’t care? I mean I do care but feel like a failure. 

Please help and maybe this will be on one of those shitty insta reels with a Minecraft background that I like to doom scroll on. ",5,1749929726.0,Advice,7,1.0,False

1lbgz13,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lbgz13/sycamore_row_by_john_grisham_ozzie_was_leaving/,"Sycamore Row by John Grisham: Ozzie was leaving church with his wife and four kids when he got the call. He arrived at the bridge in a suit, no gun or badge, but he did have a pair of old boots in the trunk. Escorted by two of his deputies, he made the walk down to the sycamore in the mud and.......","They found Seth Hubbard in the general area where he had promised to be, though not exactly in the condition expected. He was at the end of a rope, six feet off the ground and twisting slightly in the wind. A front was moving through and Seth was soaked when they found him, not that it mattered. Someone would point out that there was no mud on his shoes and no tracks below him, so therefore he was probably hanging and dead when the rain began. Why was that important? Ultimately, it was not.  
  
  The logistics of hanging oneself from a tree are not that simple. Evidently, Seth thought of everything. The rope was three-quarter-inch braided natural Manila, of some age and easily strong enough to handle Seth, who weighed 160 pounds a month earlier at the doctor’s office. Later, an employee in one of Seth’s factories would report that he had seen his boss cut the fifty-foot length from a spool a week before using it in such dramatic fashion. One end was tied firmly to a lower branch of the same tree and secured with a slapdash mix of knots and lashings. But, they held. The other end was looped over a higher branch, two feet in girth and exactly twenty-one feet from the ground. From there it fell about nine feet, culminating in a perfect hangman’s knot, one that Seth had undoubtedly worked on for some time. The noose was straight from the textbook with thirteen coils designed to collapse the loop under pressure. A true hangman’s knot snaps the neck, making death quicker and less painful, and apparently Seth had done his homework. Other than what was obvious, there was no sign of a struggle or suffering.  
  
  A six-foot stepladder had been kicked aside and was lying benignly nearby. Seth had picked his tree, flung his rope, tied it off, climbed the ladder, adjusted the noose, and, when everything was just right, kicked the ladder and fell. His hands were free and dangling near his pockets.  
  
  Had there been an instant of doubt, of second-guessing? When his feet left the safety of the ladder, but with his hands still free, had Seth instinctively grabbed the rope above his head and fought desperately until he surrendered? No one would ever know, but it looked doubtful. Later evidence would reveal that Seth had been a man on a mission.  
  
  For the occasion, he had selected his finest suit, a thick wool blend, dark gray and usually reserved for funerals in cooler weather. He owned only three. A proper hanging has the effect of stretching the body, so Seth’s trouser cuffs stopped at his ankles and his jacket stopped at his waist. His black wing tips were polished and spotless. His blue necktie was perfectly knotted. His white shirt, though, was stained with blood that had oozed from under the rope. Within hours, it would be known that Seth Hubbard had attended the 11:00 a. m. worship service at a nearby church. He had spoken to acquaintances, joked with a deacon, placed an offering in the plate, and seemed in reasonably good spirits. Most folks knew Seth was battling lung cancer, though virtually no one knew the doctors had given him a short time to live. Seth was on several prayer lists at the church. However, he carried the stigma of two divorces and would always be tainted as a true Christian.  
  
  His suicide would not help matters.  
  
  The tree was an ancient sycamore Seth and his family had owned for many years. The land around it was thick with hardwoods, valuable timber Seth had mortgaged repeatedly and parlayed into wealth. His father had acquired the land by dubious means back in the 1930s. Both of Seth’s ex-wives had tried valiantly to take the land in the divorce wars, but he held on. They got virtually everything else.  
  
  First on the scene was Calvin Boggs, a handyman and farm laborer Seth had employed for several years. Early Sunday morning, Calvin had received a call from his boss. “Meet me at the bridge at 2:00 p. m. ,” Seth said. He didn’t explain anything and Calvin was not one to ask questions. If Mr. Hubbard said to meet him somewhere at a certain time, then he would be there. At the last minute, Calvin’s ten-year-old boy begged to tag along, and, against his instincts, Calvin said yes. They followed a gravel road that zigzagged for miles through the Hubbard property. As Calvin drove, he was certainly curious about the meeting. He could not remember another occasion when he met his boss anywhere on a Sunday afternoon. He knew his boss was ill and there were rumors he was dying, but, like everything else, Mr. Hubbard kept it quiet.  
  
  The bridge was nothing more than a wooden platform spanning a nameless, narrow creek choked with kudzu and crawling with cottonmouths. For months, Mr. Hubbard had been planning to replace it with a large concrete culvert, but his bad health had sidetracked him. It was near a clearing where two dilapidated shacks rotted in the brush and overgrowth and offered the only hint that there was once a small settlement there.  
  
  Parked near the bridge was Mr. Hubbard’s late-model Cadillac, its driver’s door open, along with the trunk. Calvin rolled to a stop behind the car and stared at the open trunk and door and felt the first hint that something might be out of place. The rain was steady now and the wind had picked up, and there was no good reason for Mr. Hubbard to leave his door and trunk open. Calvin told his boy to stay in the truck, then slowly walked around the car without touching it. There was no sign of his boss. Calvin took a deep breath, wiped moisture from his face, and looked at the landscape. Beyond the clearing, maybe a hundred yards away, he saw a body hanging from a tree. He returned to his truck, again told the boy to stay inside and keep the doors locked, but it was too late. The boy was staring at the sycamore in the distance.  
  
  “Stay here now,” Calvin said sternly. “And don’t get out of the truck. ”  
  
  “Yes sir. ”  
  
  Calvin began walking. He took his time as his boots slipped in the mud and his mind tried to stay calm. What was the hurry? The closer he got the clearer things became. The man in the dark suit at the end of the rope was quite dead. Calvin finally recognized him, and he saw the stepladder, and he quickly put the scene and the events in order. Touching nothing, he backed away and returned to his truck.  
  
  It was October of 1988, and car phones had finally arrived in rural Mississippi. At Mr. Hubbard’s insistence, Calvin had one installed in his truck. He called the Ford County sheriff’s office, gave a brief report, and began waiting. Warmed by the heater and soothed by Merle Haggard on the radio, Calvin gazed through the windshield, ignored the boy, tapped his fingers along with the wipers, and realized he was crying. The boy was afraid to speak.  
  
  Two deputies arrived in the same car half an hour later, and as they were putting on rain slickers an ambulance arrived with a crew of three. From the gravel road, they all strained to see the old sycamore, but after a few seconds of focusing it was apparent there was a man hanging from it. Calvin told them everything he knew. The deputies decided it was best to proceed as if a crime had been committed, and they prohibited the ambulance crew from approaching the scene. Another deputy arrived, then another. They searched the car and found nothing helpful. They photographed and videoed Seth hanging with his eyes closed and his head twisted grotesquely to his right. They studied the tracks around the sycamore and found no evidence of anyone else being present. One deputy took Calvin to Mr. Hubbard’s home a few miles away—the boy rode in the backseat, still mute. The doors were unlocked, and on the kitchen table they found a note on a yellow legal pad. Seth had printed neatly: “To Calvin. Please inform the authorities I’ve taken my own life, with no help from anyone. On the attached sheet of paper I have left specific instructions for my funeral and burial. No autopsy! S. H. ” It was dated that day, Sunday, October 2, 1988.  
  
  Calvin was finally released by the deputies. He hustled the boy home, where he collapsed in his mother’s arms and said nothing the rest of the day.  
  
  Ozzie Walls was one of two black sheriffs in Mississippi. The other had just recently been elected from a county in the Delta that was 70 percent black. Ford County was 74 percent white, but Ozzie had won his election and reelection  
by wide margins. The blacks adored him because he was one of their own. The whites respected him because he was a tough cop and a former football star at Clanton High. In some aspects of life in the Deep South, football was slowly transcending race.  
  
  Ozzie was leaving church with his wife and four kids when he got the call. He arrived at the bridge in a suit, no gun or badge, but he did have a pair of old boots in the trunk. Escorted by two of his deputies, he made the walk down to the sycamore in the mud and under an umbrella. Seth’s body was by now soaked and water dripped from the tips of his shoes, his chin, ears, fingertips, and the cuffs of his pants. Ozzie stopped not far from the shoes, raised his umbrella, and looked at the pallid, pathetic face of a man he’d met only twice.  
  
  There was a history. In 1983, when Ozzie first ran for sheriff, he had three white opponents and no money. He received a call from Seth Hubbard, a stranger to him, and, as Ozzie would learn, a man who kept a low profile. Seth lived in the northeast corner of Ford County, almost on the line with Tyler County. He said he was in the lumber and timber business, owned some sawmills in Alabama, a factory here and there, and gave the appearance of a man who was successful. He offered to bankroll Ozzie’s campaign, but only if he would accept cash. Twenty-five thousand dollars in cash. In his office, behind a locked door, Seth Hubbard opened a box and showed Ozzie the money. Ozzie explained that campaign contributions must be reported and so on. Seth explained that he did not want his particular contribution to be reported. He wanted a cash deal, or no deal.  
  
  “What do you want in return?” Ozzie had asked.  
  
  “I want you to be elected. Nothing more,” Seth had replied.  
  
  “I’m not so sure about this. ”  
  
  “Do you think your opponents are taking cash under the table?”  
  
  “Probably. ”  
  
  “Of course they are. Don’t be foolish. ”  
  
  Ozzie took the money. He ramped up his campaign, squeaked into the runoff, then stomped his opponent in the general election. Later, he had stopped by Seth’s office on two occasions to say hello and thanks, but Mr. Hubbard was never there. Mr. Hubbard did not return phone calls. Ozzie quietly quizzed others for information about Mr. Hubbard but little was known. He was rumored to have made money in furniture, but no one knew for sure. He owned two hundred acres of land near his home. He did not use local banks or law firms or insurance agencies. He went to church occasionally.  
  
  Four years later Ozzie faced light opposition, but Seth wanted to meet anyway. Twenty-five thousand dollars changed hands again, and again Seth disappeared from view. Now he was dead, killed by his own noose and dripping with rainwater.  
  
  Finn Plunkett, the county coroner, finally arrived. The death could now be made official.  
  
  “Let’s get him down,” Ozzie said. The knots were untied, and with slack in the rope Seth’s body made its descent. They placed him on a stretcher and covered him with a thermal sheet. Four men labored under the strain as they made their way to the ambulance. Ozzie followed the little procession, as confused as anyone.  
  
  He was well into his fifth year on the job and he had seen so many dead bodies. Accidents, car wrecks, a few murders, some suicides. He wasn’t callous and he wasn’t jaded. He had made the late-night phone calls to parents and spouses, and he always feared the next one.  
  
  Good old Seth. Who, exactly, was Ozzie supposed to call now? He knew Seth was divorced but did not know if he had remarried. He knew nothing about his family. Seth was about seventy. If he had adult children, where were they?  
Oh well, Ozzie would find out soon enough. Driving toward Clanton, with the ambulance behind him, he began calling people who might know something about Seth Hubbard.  
  
  2  
  
  Jake Brigance stared at the bright red numbers of his digital alarm clock. At 5:29 he reached over, pushed a button, and gently swung his feet out of bed. Carla flipped from one side to the other and burrowed deeper under the covers. Jake patted her rear end and said good morning. There was no response. It was Monday, a workday, and she would sleep for another hour before scurrying from bed and hustling off to school with Hanna. In the summer, Carla would sleep even later and her days were filled with girl stuff and whatever Hanna wanted to do. Jake, though, had a schedule that rarely varied. Up at 5:30; at the Coffee Shop by 6:00; at the office before 7:00. Few people attacked the morning like Jake Brigance, though, now that he had reached the mature age of thirty-five, he asked himself more often why, exactly, did he awaken so early? And why did he insist on arriving at his office before all other lawyers in Clanton? The answers, once so clear, were becoming more obscure. His dream since law school of being a great trial lawyer was not diminished at all; indeed, he was as ambitious as ever. Reality was bugging him. Ten years in the trenches and his office was still filled with wills and deeds and two-bit contract disputes, not one decent criminal case and no promising car wrecks.  
  
  His most glorious moment had come and gone. The acquittal of Carl Lee Hailey was three years ago, and Jake sometimes feared he was now beyond his pinnacle. As always, though, he brushed those doubts aside and reminded himself that he was only thirty-five. He was a gladiator with many great courtroom victories before him.  
  
  There was no dog to turn out because they’d lost their dog. Max died in the fire that destroyed their beautiful and beloved and heavily mortgaged Victorian home on Adams Street, three years ago. The Klan had torched the house in the heat of the Hailey trial, July 1985. First they burned a cross in the front yard, then they tried to blow up the house. Jake sent Carla and Hanna away and it was a wise thing to do. After the Klan tried to kill him for a month, they finally burned down his house. He had given his closing argument in a borrowed suit.  
  
  The topic of a new dog was too uncomfortable to fully address. They had danced around it a few times, then moved on. Hanna wanted one and probably needed one because she was an only child and often claimed to be bored playing alone. But Jake, and especially Carla, knew who would assume the responsibility of housebreaking and cleaning up after a puppy. Besides, they were living in a rental home with their lives far from settled. Perhaps a dog could bring about some normalcy; perhaps not. Jake often pondered this issue in the early minutes of the day. The truth was he really missed a dog.  
  
  After a quick shower, Jake dressed in a small, spare bedroom he and Carla used as a closet to store their clothes. All rooms were small in this flimsy house owned by someone else. Everything was temporary. The furniture was a sad ensemble of giveaways and flea market leftovers, all of which would be tossed one day if things went as planned, though, Jake hated to admit, almost nothing was going his way. Their lawsuit against the insurance company was bogged down in pretrial maneuvering that seemed hopeless. He had filed it six months after the Hailey verdict, when he was on top of the world and bristling with confidence. How dare an insurance company try and screw him? Show him another jury in Ford County and he’d deliver another great verdict. But the swagger and bluster faded as Jake and Carla slowly realized they had been seriously underinsured. Four blocks away, their vacant and scarred lot was just sitting there, gathering leaves. From next door, Mrs. Pickle kept an eye on it, but there was little to watch. The neighbors were waiting for a fine new home to rise up and for the Brigances to return.  
  
  Jake tiptoed into Hanna’s room, kissed her on the cheek and pulled the sheets up a bit higher. She was seven now, their only child, and there would be no others. She was in the second grade at Clanton Elementary, in a classroom around the corner from where her mother taught kindergartners.  
  
  In the narrow kitchen, Jake pushed a button on the coffee brewer and watched the machine until it began making noises. He opened his briefcase, touched the 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol holstered inside, and stuffed in some files. He had grown accustomed to carrying a gun and this saddened him. How could he live a normal life with a weapon nearby at all times? Normal or not, the gun was a necessity. They burn your house after they try to bomb it; they threaten your wife on the phone; they torch a cross in your front yard; they beat your secretary’s husband senseless and he later dies; they use a sniper to take a shot, but he misses you and hits a guard; they wage terror during the trial and keep up their threats long after it’s over.  
  
  Four of the terrorists were now serving prison sentences—three federal, one at Parchman. Only four, Jake reminded himself constantly. There should have been a dozen convictions by now, a feeling shared by Ozzie and other black leaders in the county. Out of habit and out of a sense of frustration, Jake called the FBI at least once a week for updates on their investigation. After three years, his calls were often not returned. He wrote letters. His file filled an entire cabinet in his office.  
  
  Only four. He knew the names of many others, all suspects still, in Jake’s mind anyway. Some had moved and some had stayed, but they were out there, going about their lives as if nothing had happened. So he carried a gun, one with all the proper permits and such. There was one in his briefcase. One in his car. A couple around the office, and several others. His hunting rifles had gone up in the fire, but Jake was slowly rebuilding his collection.  
  
  He stepped outside, onto the small brick porch, and filled his lungs with the cool air. On the street, directly in front of the house, there was a Ford County sheriff’s patrol car, and behind the wheel sat one Louis Tuck, a full-time deputy who worked the graveyard shift and whose primary responsibility was to be seen in the neighborhood throughout the night and, specifically, to be parked near the mailbox at precisely 5:45 each morning, Monday through Saturday, when Mr. Brigance stepped onto the porch and waved hello. Tuck waved back. The Brigances had survived another night.  
  
  As long as Ozzie Walls was sheriff of Ford County, which would be at least three more years and probably much longer, he and his office would do whatever possible to protect Jake and his family. Jake had taken Carl Lee Hailey’s case, worked like a dog for peanuts, dodged bullets, ignored real threats, and lost almost everything before delivering a not-guilty verdict that still resonated in Ford County. Protecting him was Ozzie’s highest priority.  
  
  Tuck eased away. He would circle the block and return in a few minutes after Jake left. He would watch the house until he saw lights in the kitchen and knew Carla was up and moving around.  
  
  Jake drove one of two Saabs in Ford County, a red one with 190,000 miles on it. He needed an upgrade but couldn’t afford one. Such an exotic car in a small town had once been a cool idea, but now the repair costs were brutal. The nearest dealer was in Memphis, an hour away, so every trip to the shop killed half a day and cost a thousand bucks. Jake was ready for an American model, and he thought about this every morning when he turned the ignition key and held his breath as the engine rolled over and came to life. The engine had never failed to start, but in the past few weeks Jake had noticed a delay, an extra turn or two that evoked an ominous warning that something bad was about to happen. Paranoid, he was noticing other noises and rattles, and he was checking the tires every other day as the treads grew thinner. He backed onto Culbert Street, which, though only four blocks from Adams Street and their vacant lot, was clearly in a lesser part of town. The house next door was also a rental. Adams was lined with homes much older and statelier and with more character. Culbert was a hodgepodge of suburban-style boxes thrown up before the city got serious about zoning.  
  
  Though she said little, Jake knew Carla was ready to move on, to somewhere.  
  
  They had actually talked of moving away, of leaving Clanton altogether. The three  
years since the Hailey trial had been far less prosperous than they had hoped and expected. If Jake was destined to slog through a long career as a struggling lawyer, then why not struggle somewhere else? Carla could teach school anywhere. Surely they could find a good life that did not include weapons and constant vigilance. Jake may have been revered by the blacks in Ford County, but he was still resented by many of the whites. And the crazies were still out there. On the other hand, there was a certain safety living in the midst of so many friends. Their neighbors watched the traffic and a strange car or truck was noted. Every cop in town and every deputy in the county knew the safety of the little Brigance family was of the highest importance.  
  
  Jake and Carla would never leave, though it was sometimes amusing to play the old game of where-would-you-like-to-live? It was only a game because Jake knew the brutal truth that he would never fit in a big firm in a big city, nor would he ever find a small town in any state that was not already brimming with hungry lawyers. He was looking clearly at his future, and he was okay with it. He just needed to make a buck.  
  
  He drove past the empty lot on Adams, mumbled vile words in condemnation of the cowards who torched his home and managed a few choice ones for the insurance company as well, then sped away. From Adams he turned onto Jefferson, then Washington, which ran east and west along the north side of the Clanton square. His office was on Washington, across from the stately courthouse, and he parked in the same spot each morning at 6:00 a. m. because at that hour there were plenty to choose from. The square would be quiet for two more hours, until the courthouse and the shops and offices around it opened for business.  
  
  The Coffee Shop, though, was bustling with blue collars, farmers, and deputies when Jake strolled in and began saying good morning. As always, he was the only one wearing a coat and tie. The white collars gathered an hour later across the square at the Tea Shoppe and discussed interest rates and world politics. At the Coffee Shop they talked football, local politics, and bass fishing. Jake was one of the very few professionals tolerated inside the Coffee Shop. There were several reasons for this: he was well liked, thick-skinned, and good-natured; and, he was always available for a quick legal tip at no charge when one of the mechanics or truck drivers was in a bind. He hung his jacket on the wall and found a seat at a table with Marshall Prather, a deputy. Two days earlier, Ole Miss had lost to Georgia by three touchdowns and this was the hot topic. A gum-smacking, sassy gal named Dell poured his coffee while managing to bump him with her ample ass—the same routine six mornings a week. Within minutes she delivered food he never ordered—wheat toast, grits, and strawberry jelly, the usual. As Jake was shaking Tabasco sauce on the grits, Prather asked, “Say, Jake, did you know Seth Hubbard?”  
  
  “Never met him,” Jake said, catching a few glances. “I’ve heard his name once or twice. Had a place up near Palmyra, didn’t he?”  
  
  “That’s it. ” Prather chewed on a sausage as Jake sipped his coffee.  
  
  Jake waited, then said, “I guess it’s safe to assume something bad happened to Seth Hubbard because you put him in the past tense.

Right now we live in a 2 bedroom apartment on the fourth floor where all the doors in the apartment are left open, so he has full roam of the house. He's fully indoor although I've taken him out on a leash walk a handful of times. He likes to chill in the same room as me but in a different part of the room (eg he'll be on the desk if I'm in bed, or he'll be under the coffee table if I'm on the sofa). He has lots of toys and we play fetch with his mice etc. He's never really been a scratcher and doesn't really use scratch boards.

The room we'll be moving into will be quite small compared to the current apartment. It's about the size of my current bedroom. It has an en-suite where I'll have his litter box. I am planning on bringing both of his cat trees to try and maximise vertical space. He will have two window sills to look out of. Unfortunately he can't have free roam of the house as all of the doors are fire doors so they need to be kept closed when not in use. I can't put any shelves up as I'm only renting the room for a year.

What advice do you have to help me make this an easier transition for him? I'm worried about the space feeling cramped for him and him being bored by being stuck in one room. The place we are moving to is a bit more rural so I've considered taking him out for walks and hikes to entertain him/tire him out. I wouldn't be able to let him be an outdoor cat though, as there is no safe way for him to get in and out of the house/shared room independently and the house is near a very busy street.

1lbgtox,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lbgtox/i_23f_am_in_a_relationship_with_a_partner_on_the/,I (23F) am in a relationship with a Partner on the autism spectrum (20M),"Hello everyone, 

Thank you all for reading this. First of all, I would like to apologise for any weird or wonky language, as English is my primary but not first language. As this is quite the long post you can find a TDLR at the end. 

I (23F) are in a relationship with a Partner (20M) on the autism-spectrum (formally in this case defined as Asperger’s-Syndrome). We’ve been together for approx. half a year now. We’ve had our really high ups and our really significant downs. It’s been one hack of a rollercoaster. 


Last June we met and he instantly fell in love with me. 2 months later went by and we started to be in a relationship. When we first started dating he told me that he lived in a different city, had 2 kids (not married, lived with their mothers), a car and a Job at a big tech company. 

Around Christmas time (2 months into dating) I met his mum. Turns out, he didn’t had kids, didn’t had a car and did in fact not work at a big tech company. His second name was false (he doesn’t have one), his age was wrong as well (20 not 24) and he lived in my city, not the other one like he told me. I was also informed that he is on the autism spectrum (by his mum, not by him). I am on the ADHD spectrum but he knew that from the start. 

We had a sit-down conversation and I talked to him about it. I said what character traits gave the impression that he was on the spectrum and how the whole situation made me feel and that I loved him, so I would stay. But honestly, I was speechless. All the lies. I was devastated by the fact that he lied to me. Until this day, we never had a conversation to figure out why he lied to me. 

Weeks went by and his mothers boyfriend kicked him out of the house, because he was in his bedroom the whole day sleeping and at night all he did was watching TV. At this time he already had sent out his application to the big tech company he told me he worked at but refused to apply for any other job. This was on Christmas Eve.

He lived with his grandmother for a while because he didn’t want to stay at my place due to my roommate. 

In January, he moved near me. He enrolled at my university to get student housing. We had a lot of fights, one resolved in a big shitty breakup, because I couldn’t take it anymore. I happened, because I had a lot of stuff going on as well (lost my side job, had a lot of study related pressure from my parents) so I cried a lot. When I cried because I felt unseen by him, he just watched me cry, ignored me and got mad at me for crying. When he had a problem, I always tried to come up with solutions that he never liked so he accused me of dismissing his feelings. 

Fast forward, we didn’t spoke for a few weeks. In these weeks I personally had a lot of ups and downs but overall I missed him. We had a talk through and he told me how bad he felt the past weeks because he can’t live alone (he can’t or doesn’t cook, doesn’t do laundry or anything else) and that I neglected him and that hurt him. 

We got better after that. In June he started his work at that big tech company. I love the way he lights up when he works. He works 20h/week. After a week he approached me with having health-insurance related problems at work, that resolved in the tech company not being able to pay him. So here’s the thing: he gets/got money from his parents while he wasn’t working (approx. 800$ a month). He told me he has no savings (but honestly I don’t know if that’s true) and (as of right now) doesn’t get salary because of the insurance problem. But last week, he bought a Nintendo Switch 2. Not one, but 2, with all the accessories. 

 I make around 2000$ a month. He’s mad, when he has to pay for groceries. We get Hello Fresh (3 meals/once a week). I cook, I clean, I take the trash out, I go to work, I study. He dismisses my feelings. We’ve once done something I liked and he ruined my day because he was in a bad mood all day. We spent $$$ on his hobbies, his likings. When I ask him to pay for something (even something small that’s cheaper that 5$) he accuses me of being a gold digger and being after his money (what money???). 

I think I am going insane. I feel like I am always on fire and everything’s my fault. 

I am currently at my parents house for my dads birthday and he messaged me this morning asking if I took the coffee with me???? The coffee is empty and I got 2 sets of fresh new beans from his favourite coffee place that cost me 50$. I stashed them away, not sure if he finds them when I return back on Monday. 

Is there anyway to talk to him and make him understand how I am feeling? I know with that kind of autism it’s always better to have a straight forward approach. 

Tl;DR: bf is on autism spectrum, dismisses my feelings and makes me feel uncomfortable. ",0,1749929059.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

He is happy however I feel like the spark is gone, where do I go after I feel like we just hit a breaking point?","**The Problem.**

As stated in the title, I began a relationship with my boyfriend 5 months ago, in the beginning, it was all sunshine and rainbows as all relationships are in the beginning, but as of the past month or so, the relationship has become a weight I feel I must carry, and recently I had what felt like a breaking point following several other red flags, so I need a third party to tell me if this is normal and just the end of the honeymoon phase or if this is seriously worth breaking up over.

**First Incident.**

Before about one month ago, we hadn't really had any big grandiose dates so I wanted to take him to a fancy restaurant, so I scrounged my funds and was able to afford to take us to a moderately fancy place (for those wondering, it was a Fogo de Chao), before we left I made sure he had brought his wallet and had told him he would need to pay the tip. Once we got there we eat and the typical date stuff goes on, however, about 40 minutes in he says he has to use the restroom, after he is in there for about 15 minutes I go in and find him watching Tiktok in the restroom stall, I leave and he comes back after another 20 minutes. At the end of the date we are paying, I pay for the bill, however when we get to the tip, he asks me to pitch in as he cant cover a fair percent (he brought 20$, which would have only been about a 13% tip), so I have to help chip in on top of already paying the bill. Not only this after the meal he says the date was ""nice"" a couple times but not much after that.

**Second Incident**

Over the Friday which just passed we were intending to go to a major waterpark in my state for my 18th birthday, however due to a thunderstorm warning for the intended day (which ended up getting repealed day of, it was an insanely sunny day), we were not able to go. The problem came when deciding what to do instead, I was having trouble deciding since I had been dead set on the waterpark, however he spits out the idea of a roller rink, I decline stating I didn't know how, him and the other person who was coming also stated they could not skate, so we kept brainstorming, we eventually decided an escape room, however before then every time we had a spot where we were thinking of ideas he just kept saying to go skating, it got to the point where at one point he told the third friend (who was helping to pay) that I was thinking of going skating, which I had to correct. The silver lining was that when we made it to the escape room he stopped being like that and we eventually were able to have a great time.

**Third Incident**

I still live with my mother (35F) as I am taking classes to work towards an associate and try to not be too much of a pest. The problem comes in directly after the previous incident, she was there since it's an important day to her and it's just common sense for her to be there, bottom line its her house. To add onto this she was nice enough to have ordered some pizza when we got home, overall an insanely nice thing in my opinion. Overall we do the little celebration, finish eating and then once were done eating we do the cake, once i blow out the candles my mother says ""you know I gotta do this, what's that right there (pointing at the cake)"", for context every birthday for every one in my family gets their face pushed for their birthday, doesnt matter of age, its an inevitable assault charge which happens every birthday (joking of course). So I play along and she smashes my face in the cake, us three (me, my mom, and friend three) all laugh a bit and I pick up my napkin to wipe my face down a bit but then my boyfriend goes ""why did you do that?"", we answer him, telling him how its a thing we do in the family, but he responds with how its a gross thing to do, which I could see if we were serving the bits which had just been smashed, but we don't, we cut around that part and usually only the person who had their face smashed and the relatives which are fine with eating it eat it. We eat yet he still goes on about how its still nasty, him only eating a small bit. *Note: I think this is fair enough but I still think it was a prickish thing to continue pestering about it, complaining, while still eating the cake.*

***The Breaking Point***

In a shocking enough event, he wasn't fully involved in the breaking point, I wake up, go down and eat a simple breakfast, drinking my coffee while watching some TV(I have no obligations today, its a Saturday). Later on, my mother comes in, asking to talk about something, so she sits down and we discuss. Apparently, behind my back, after me and friend three had gone upstairs after helping clean to mess around on my old Xbox 360, my boyfriend stays downstairs, he begins to go up to my mom, saying ""I thought Brandon didn't like pizza?"" she responds about how she knows I dont prefer it but friend three was 17 and his mom still had a curfew for him (which boyfriend knew about). Boyfriend respond with ""well he still doesnt like it so why would you *make* him eat it on his birthday"". Now listen, I don't *like* pizza, but it's still a good quick food to eat, he knows the same, when I stay at his house in fact we still often eat pizza, and while a nice dinner would have been nice, I didn't want to exclude our friend and I still loved the little dinner we did have, so it still feels extreme for him to have gone and mean mugged my mom over such a small thing and when I heard it, my boyfriend who I honestly have already been debating breaking up with, had done such a thing, while small, it still feels like this should be where I take a stand for myself and refuse to keep leading him on and to free myself from the chains.

**Other Info**

1) I feel like our relationship is now draining to the point where I have began to lose interest in things and feel like if I don't cut this off now its just going to keep draining on me.

2) For note this is my first relationship.

1lbgper,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1lbgper/from_heat_gun_to_kaleido_m10/,From heat gun to Kaleido M10,"Hey folks!

After a few years of hand-roasting and getting my process dialed in, and getting good reviews from occasional tasters, I bit the bullet and made the jump to a proper roaster.

Given my remote location and electrical panel, the M10 hit the sweet spot for letting me ramp up to production for the local farmers market/coffee shop, and some online sales. My goal is to make enough to pay for the machine over a year or so, and in the meantime enjoy the ""leftover"" beans for myself.

I thought getting more control over my roasts would allow me to get a more homogeneous roasting experience than a heat gun and a colander, and it does...but. 

First couple of roasts truly suck. I know I have to burn out the manufacturing oils and season the drum. I also planned on spending a few roasts calibrating and getting to know the machine, and I think I'm getting there. 

Batch #4 is currently sitting in my cup, and the first sip or two are pretty good. Almost the aroma I was aiming for, good sweetness in the cup, some acidity and bean character...but after a few sips, there is a nasty burned mouth feel that comes through. Like I was drinking the crumbs from the bottom of a toaster. 

I'm having a hard time telling if that's a burned roast, or if it's a sign of the roaster still needing a few more purge roasts. For context, this thing is blazingly fast, and I've spent the last few roasts learning to manage lower and lower heat. This batch looked and smelled good, but I have noticed tipping on maybe 2% of the beans.

Otherwise, I'd love to hear from other owners about their experiences. The first batch I tossed in (300g Costa Rica H1) hit first crack at 3:56 from a charge temp of 210c. That was...eye-opening. Good fertilizer, though.  
  
I've since dropped to 400g with a charge of 170. Aiming for the suggest profile in Cultivar of 4:15/2:45/1:30 (dry end/FC/dev) and I'm hitting 3:58/2:42/1:30 with respective temps of 144/173/181 from a TP at 88c. I don't have any references for those temperatures, but when I roast the same beans with a heat gun and an infrared thermometer, I hit first crack around \~207c. 

I gather calibration on the M10 is off, but I can live with that. Just not sure if I need to manage my curves better, or clean the machine more. It would also be nice to get some kind of sense of what reference temperatures I should be looking at. With a density of \~.69 on these beans, what would I expect for FC temps? I love Cultivar and Modulating for guidebooks, but I'd feel a smidge more confident in my adjustments if I could sense of what sort of baseline temps there are.

Fellow M10 roasters, how would be approaching this? The best I can think of is to ignore the heat, and use the first crack as the only ""known"" point, and then calibrate dry end and development from that. Is there another way?",4,1749928745.0,roasting,3,1.0,False

Insert the breville touch impress. It feels like the best of both worlds. 
Wanting opinions. I am not a coffee snob per say but even my magnifica is better than most coffee shops where I live. I also am super remote so this gives me a coffee fix without driving an hour to a cafe.

I feel like the more I read people suggest going to Bambino plus with a grinder, but I just don't want to spend forever dialing it in. 
At the most I would be okay with I grinder that once I set gives me the amount I need so I don't have to weigh. Then auto shot and milk with option of manual milk. ",2,1749928731.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1lbgoe9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PornAddiction/comments/1lbgoe9/wife_of_an_addict_needing_a_parental_control_app/,Wife of an addict  needing a parental control app,"Hello people of Reddit,


I have been with my husband for 9 years. A few years ago I went to use his phone for something and he had a porn site up. 

Long story short I found out he was looking at these sites multiple times a day. At home, we work, the coffee shop he would go to everyday. 

The amount of porn, and the places he watched them was an issue for me as we don’t have a healthy sex life. We can go six months and not have sex, his choice. He’s in his 50’s and has ED but has a prescription for it. He says he has no sex drive but watches porn all of the time. 

I found out last weekend he was still doing it despite promising me to have stopped. 

It the turned into a huge fight and I told him I’m done. And I meant it as this continues to happen and I’ve given him several chances. 

He left our house and reached out to his old therapist he went to before for this. He has admitted he has an addiction and needs help. Which is the first time he’s ever admitted this. 

I decided to give him another opportunity, to stand by him and support him. 

His therapist suggested getting an app I would have the control over for basically parental control. To either block these sites or have the app notify me to make him accountable. 

There are a ton of apps out there and I’m wondering if anyone has used any they can share with me?",1,1749928671.0,PornAddiction,1,1.0,False

My husband and I are moving to Abu Dhabi, and we’re trying to decide between Maria Island and Al Mushrif for our new home. We both love walking, exploring nice areas, and having easy access to good spots for coffee and breakfast.

After back to back passionate date nights he decided to flip and ghost me . Initially, I thought okay he is busy and a classic aquarius, so I got busy with life but then he actually deleted his messaging apps too. So he was pretty much unreachable except for call.When I call him he is always in middle of something so we never get to talk but he never made the effort to call back. I know most of you probably thinking he is not that into me but he is doing this for at least 4 years now. On and off.  However HE ALWAYS SEES MY STORIES. I feel like I am stalked hard. 

So like yesterday,
He posted a day of him enjoying coffee at a cafe and working in his laptop. He was alone. Then I posted a very hot selfie of mine ( very Leo venus of me xD) Then he posted a note in Facebook at 2 AM  that says 'Seeking Prayers'

I got really worried, I messaged him but didn't call as it was too late at night? I messaged in his number too asking if he okay and that I am there if he need any support. However, he didn't see my messages ( I think) but then by noon today things seemed fine! He posted a story with a view around his office. Then an hour ago he posted a hot aff mirror selfie of his. Now idk if pulling that seeking prayers thing was a trick to hold my attention. He looks so goddamn sexy guys I just want to kisss him and I want us to get back normal 😭 I don't even mind of he use me lmao but what the fuck is this distance 😭

So, on our phone call today, he asked me when we are seeing each other and then he kind of said, „okay so can you come on Monday?“ The way he's saying this is kind of controlling, like he doesn't ask me when I have time He's just saying stuff like: “so you're coming then and then..” 

And then I told him I'm not sure yet because maybe I want to go to a different city on Monday. That's what I said without an explanation of what I want to do. Because sometimes I just want to go to a city to study in a coffee shop alone. But he doesn't know that. So anyways, then he asked me what I want to do in the city and I told him I maybe want to go to the Asian market. He only asked why aren't I asking him to go together.. I kind of have this old pattern of him and his behaviour still in my mind, also was thinking about that he has to work on Tuesday. 
He then got upset and my phone went off. After a while he told me that he talked to his mom on the phone, and he told her what I've been saying to him on our phone call. which kind of flabbergasted me that he directly had to tell his mom. And I think that's controlling as well, because he told his mom so that I feel guilty of not inviting him when I go out, so that I won't do it again. Probably. I'm not sure, but that's just the way I'm thinking about this situation. 

He's much younger than me so maybe he's  insecure in general and just wanted to tell his mom but I don't see any reason of why he directly has to tell her on the phone call. Also, I planned to meet a friend of mine that I haven't seen for over a year. She's my only female friend and I wanted to meet her this week, but my Bf asked me to come over for a few days again and I don't know what to do. I mean, I'm a bit lazy and I should be doing assignments. And on the phone call he told me: „so you will do all your stuff on Sunday so that you are free on Monday and that you feel good and you can come to my place in the evening“ That's what he said, but I kind of feel pressured now. I didnt text him back yet",5,1749928594.0,whatdoIdo,11,0.78,False

 I woke up on the bathroom floor. Everything hurt. My mouth felt like garbage and tasted worse. What the hell had happened last night? The last thing I remembered was the countdown to midnight and the thrill of turning twenty-one, legal at last. I'd been dancing with Lauren and talking to some guy. Then BANG!  Tequila. A whole line of shot glasses with lemon and salt on the side.  
  Everything I’d heard about Vegas was true. Bad things happened here, terrible things. I just wanted to crawl into a ball and die. Sweet baby Jesus, what had I been thinking to drink so much? I groaned and even that made my head pound. This pain had not been part of the plan.  
You okay?” a voice enquired, male, deep, and nice. Really nice. A shiver went through me despite my pain. My poor broken body stirred in the strangest of places.  
Are you going to be sick again?” he asked. Oh, no.  I opened my eyes and sat up, pushing my greasy blonde hair aside. His blurry face loomed closer. I slapped a hand over my mouth because my breath had to be hideous. “Hi,” I mumbled. Slowly, he swam into focus. He was built and beautiful and strangely familiar. Impossible. I’d never met anyone like him.  
  He looked to be in his mid-to-late twenties—a man, not a boy. He had long, dark hair falling past his shoulders and sideburns. His eyes were the darkest blue. They couldn’t be real. Frankly, those eyes were overkill. I’d have swooned perfectly fine without them. Even with the tired red tinge they were a thing of beauty. Tattoos covered the entirety of one arm and half his bare chest. A black bird had been inked into the side of his neck, the tip of its wing reaching up behind his ear. I still had on the pretty, dirty white dress Lauren had talked me into. It had been a daring choice for me on account of the way it barely contained my abundance of boobage. But this beautiful man easily had me beat for skin on show. He wore just a pair of jeans, some scuffed black boots, a couple of small silver earrings, and a loose white bandage on his forearm.  
  
  Those jeans … he wore them well. They sat invitingly low on his hips and fit in all the right ways. Even my monster hangover couldn’t detract from the view.  
  
  “Aspirin?” he asked.  
  
  And I was ogling him. My gaze darted to his face and he gave me a sly, knowing smile. Wonderful. “Yes. Please. ”  
  
  He grabbed a battered black leather jacket off the floor, the one I’d apparently been using as a pillow. Thank God I hadn’t puked on it. Clearly, this beautiful half naked man had seen me in all my glory, hurling multiple times. I could have drowned in the shame.  
  
  One by one he emptied the contents of his pockets out onto the cold white tiles. A credit card, guitar picks, a phone and a string of condoms. The condoms gave me pause but I was soon distracted by what emerged next. A multitude of paper scraps tumbled out onto the floor. All had names and numbers scrawled across them. This guy was Mr Popularity. Hey, I could definitely see why. But what on earth was he doing here with me?  
  
  Finally, he produced a small bottle of pain-killers. Sweet relief. I loved him, whoever he was and whatever he’d seen.  
  
  “You need water,” he said, and got busy filling a glass from the sink behind him.  
  
  The bathroom was tiny. We both barely fit. Given Lauren’s and my money situation, the hotel had been the best we could afford. She’d been determined to celebrate my birthday in style. My goal had been a bit different. Despite the presence of my hot new friend, I was pretty sure I’d failed. The pertinent parts of my anatomy felt fine. I’d heard things hurt after the first couple of times. They sure as hell had after the first. But my vagina might have been the only part of my body not giving me grief.  
  
  Still, I took a quick peek down the front of my dress. The corner of a foil package could still be seen, tucked into the side of my bra. Because if it was sitting there, strapped to me, no way would I be caught unprepared. The condom remained whole and hearty. How disappointing. Or maybe not. Finally plucking up the courage to get back on the horse, so to speak, and then not remembering it would have been horrible.  
  
  The man handed me the glass of water and placed two pills into my hand. He then sat back on his haunches to watch me. He had an intensity to him that I was in no condition to deal with.  
  
  “Thanks,” I said, then swallowed the aspirin. Noisy rumbles rose from my belly. Nice, very ladylike.  
  
  “Are you sure you’re okay?” he asked. His glorious mouth twitched into a smile as if we shared a private joke between us.  
  
  The joke being me.  
  
  All I could do was stare. Given my current condition, he was just too much. The hair, face, body, ink, all of it. Someone needed to invent a word superlative enough to describe him.  
  
  After a long moment it dawned on me that he expected an answer to his question. I nodded, still unwilling to unleash my morning breath, and gave him a grim smile. The best I could do.  
  
  “Okay. That’s good,” he said.  
  
  He was certainly attentive. I didn’t know what I’d done to deserve such kindness. If I’d picked up the poor guy with promises of sex and then proceeded to spend the night with my head in the toilet, by rights he should be a bit disgruntled. Maybe he hoped I’d make good on the offer this morning. It seemed the only plausible explanation for why he’d linger.  
  
  Under normal conditions, he was light years out of my league and (for the sake of my pride) worlds away from my type. I liked clean-cut. Clean-cut was nice. Bad boys were highly overrated. God knows, I’d watched enough girls throw themselves at my brother over the years. He’d taken what they’d offered if it suited him, and then moved on. Bad boys weren’t the stuff serious relationships were made of. Not that I’d been chasing forever last night, just a positive sexual experience. Something not involving Tommy Byrnes being mad at me for getting a smear of blood on the back seat of his parents’ car. God, what a horrible memory. The next day the douche had dumped me for a girl on the track team half my size. He then added insult to injury by spreading rumors about me. I hadn’t been made bitter or twisted by this event at all.  
  
  What had happened last night? My head remained a tangled, throbbing mess, the details hazy, incomplete.  
  
  “We should get something into you,” he said. “You want me to order some dry toast or something?”  
  
  “No. ” The thought of food was not fun. Not even coffee appealed and coffee always appealed. I was half tempted to check myself for a pulse, just in case. Instead, I pushed my hand through my crappy hair, getting it out of my eyes. “No, I … ow!” Strands caught on something, tugging hard at my scalp. “Crap. ”  
  
  “Hang on. ” He reached out and carefully disentangled my messy do from whatever was causing the trouble. “There we go. ”  
  
  “Thanks. ” Something winked at me from my left hand, snagging my attention. A ring, but not just any ring. An amazing ring, a stupendous one.  
  
  “Holy shit,” I whispered.  
  
  It couldn’t be real. It was so big it bordered on obscene. A stone that size would cost a fortune. I stared, bemused, turning my hand to catch the light. The band beneath was thick, solid, and the rock sure shone and sparkled like the real deal.  
  
  As if.  
  
  “Ah, yeah. About that …” he said, dark brows drawn down. He looked vaguely embarrassed by the ice rink on my finger. “If you still wanna change it for something smaller, that’s okay with me. It is kinda big. I do get your point about that. ”  
  
  I couldn’t shake the feeling I knew him from somewhere. Somewhere that wasn’t last night or this morning or anything to do with the ridiculous beautiful ring on my finger.  
  
  “You bought me this?” I asked.  
  
  He nodded. “Last night at Cartier. ”r />  
  “Cartier?” My voice dropped to a whisper. “Huh. ”  
  
  For a long moment he just stared at me. “You don’t remember?”  
  
  I really didn’t want to answer that. “What is that even? Two, three carats?”  
  
  “Five. ”  
  
  “Five? Wow. ”  
  
  “What do you remember?” he asked, voice hardening just a little.  
  
  “Well … it’s hazy. ”  
  
  “No. ” His frown increased until it owned his handsome face. “You have got to be fucking kidding me. You seriously don’t know?”  
  
  What to say? My mouth hung open, useless. There was a lot I didn’t know. To my knowledge, however, Cartier didn’t do costume jewelry. My head swam. Bad feelings unfurled within my stomach and bile burnt the back of my throat. Worse even than before.  
  
  I was not puking in front of this guy.  
  
  Not again.  
  
  He took a deep breath, nostrils flaring. “I didn’t realize you’d had that much to drink. I mean, I knew you’d had a bit, but … shit. Seriously? You don’t remember us going on the gondolas at The Venetian?”  
  
  “We went on gondolas?”  
  
  “Fuck. Ah, how about when you bought me a burger? Do you remember that?”  
  
  “Sorry. ”  
  
  “Wait a minute,” he said, watching me through narrowed eyes. “You’re just messing with me, aren’t you?”  
  
  “I’m so sorry. ”  
  
  He physically recoiled from me. “Let me get this straight, you don’t remember anything?”  
  
  “No,” I said, swallowing hard. “What did we do last night?”  
  
  “We got fucking married,” he growled.  
  
  This time, I didn’t make it to the toilet.  
  I decided on divorce while I brushed my teeth, practiced what I would say to him as I washed my hair. But you couldn’t rush these things. Unlike last night when I’d apparently rushed into marriage. Rushing again would be wrong, foolish. That, or I was a coward taking the world’s longest shower. Odds were on the latter.  
  
  Holy, holy hell. What a mess. I couldn’t even begin to get my head wrapped around it. Married. Me. My lungs wouldn’t work. Panic waited right around the corner.  
  
  No way could my desire for this disaster to go away come as a surprise to him. Puking on the floor had to have been a huge hint. I groaned and covered my face with my hands at the memory. His look of disgust would haunt me all my days.

 My parents would kill me if they ever found out. I had plans, priorities. I was studying to be an architect like my father. Marriage to anyone at this stage didn’t fit into those plans. In another ten, fifteen years maybe. But marriage at twenty-one? Hell no. I hadn’t even been on a second date in years and now I had a ring on my finger. No way did that make sense. I was doomed. This crazy wedding caper wasn’t something I could hide from.  
  
  Or could I?  
  
  Unless my parents could not find out. Ever. Over the years I had made something of a habit of not involving them in things that might be seen as unsavory, unnecessary, or just plain stupid. This marriage quite possibly fell under all three categories.  
  
  Actually, maybe no one need know. If I didn’t tell, how would they find out? They wouldn’t. The answer was awe-inspiring in its simplicity.  
  
  “Yes!” I hissed and punched the air, clipping the shower head with the side of my fist. Water sprayed everywhere including straight in my eyes, blinding me. Never mind, I had the answer.  
  
  Denial. I’d take the secret to my grave. No one would ever know of my extreme drunken idiocy.  
  
  I smiled with relief, my panic attack receding enough so that I could breathe. Oh, thank goodness. Everything would be okay. I had a new plan to get me back on track with the old one. Brilliant. I’d brave up, go and face him, and set things straight. Twenty-one-year-olds with grand life plans didn’t marry complete strangers in Vegas, no matter how beautiful those strangers happened to be. It would be fine. He’d understand. In all likelihood, he sat out there right now, working out the most efficient method to dump and run.  
  
  The diamond still glittered on my hand. I couldn’t bring myself to take it off just yet. It was like Christmas on my finger, so big, bright, and shiny. Though, upon reflection, my temporary husband didn’t exactly appear to be rich. His jacket and jeans were both well worn. The man was a mystery.  
  
  Wait. What if he was into something illegal? Maybe I’d married a criminal. Panic rushed back in with a vengeance. My stomach churned and my head throbbed. I knew nothing about the person waiting in the next room. Absolutely not a damn thing. I’d shoved him out the bathroom door without even getting his name.  
  
  A knock on the door sent my shoulders sky high.  
  
  “Evelyn?” he called out, proving he at least knew my name.  
  
  “Just a second. ”  
  
  I turned off the taps and stepped out, wrapping a towel around myself. The width of it was barely sufficient to cover my curves, but my dress had puke on it. Putting it back on was out of the question.  
  
  “Hi,” I said, opening the bathroom door a hand’s length. He stood almost half a head taller than me and I wasn’t short by any means. Dressed in only a towel, I found him rather intimidating. However much he’d had to drink the previous night he still looked gorgeous as opposed to my pale, pasty and sopping wet. The aspirin hadn’t done nearly as much as it should have.  
  
  Of course, I’d thrown it up.  
  
  “Hey. ” He didn’t meet my eyes. “Look, I’m going to get this taken care of, okay?”  
  
  “Taken care of?”  
  
  “Yeah,” he said, still avoiding all eye contact. Apparently the hideous green motel carpeting was beyond enticing. “My lawyers will deal with all this. ”  
  
  “You have lawyers?” Criminals had lawyers. Shit. I had to get myself divorced from this guy now.  
  
  “Yeah, I have lawyers. You don’t need to worry about anything. They’ll send you the paperwork or whatever. However this works. ” He gave me an irritated glance, lips a tight line, and pulled on his leather jacket over his bare chest. His T-shirt still hung drying over the edge of the tub. Sometime during the night I must have puked on it too. How gruesome. If I were him, I’d divorce me and never look back.  
  
  “This was a mistake,” he said, echoing my thoughts.  
  
  “Oh. ”  
  
  “What?” His gaze jumped to my face. “You disagree?”  
  
  “No,” I said quickly.  
  
  “Didn’t think so. Pity it made sense last night, yeah?” He shoved a hand through his hair and made for the door. “Take care. ”  
  
  “Wait!” The stupid, amazing ring wouldn’t come off my finger. I tugged and turned it, trying to wrestle it into submission. Finally it budged, grazing my knuckle raw in the process. Blood welled to the surface. One more stain in this whole sordid affair. “Here. ”  
  
  “For fuck’s sake. ” He scowled at the rock sparkling in the palm of my hand as if it had personally offended him. “Keep it. ”  
  
  “I can’t. It must have cost a fortune. ”  
  
  He shrugged.  
  
  “Please. ” I held it out, hand jiggling, impatient to be rid of the evidence of my drunken stupidity. “It belongs to you. You have to take it. ”  
  
  “No. I don’t. ”  
  
  “But—”  
  
  Without another word the man stormed out, slamming the door shut behind him. The thin walls vibrated with the force of it.  
  
  Whoa. My hand fell back to my side. He sure had a temper. Not that I hadn’t given him provocation, but still. I wish I remembered what had gone on between us. Any inkling would be good.  
  
  Meanwhile my left butt cheek felt sore. I winced, carefully rubbing the area. My dignity wasn’t the only casualty, it seemed. I must have scratched my behind at some stage, bumped into some furniture or taken a dive in my fancy new heels. The pricey ones Lauren had insisted went with the dress, the ones whose current whereabouts were a mystery. I hoped I hadn’t lost them. Given my recent nuptials, nothing would surprise me.  
  
  I wandered back into the bathroom with a vague memory of a buzzing noise and laughter ringing in my ear, of him whispering to me. It made no sense.  
  
  I turned and raised the edge of my towel, going up on tippy-toe to inspect my ample ass in the mirror. Black ink and hot pink skin.  
  
  All the air left my body in a rush.  
  
  There was a word on my left butt cheek, a name.  
  
  David  
  
  I spun and dry-heaved into the sink.  
  
  **CHAPTER TWO**  
  
  Lauren sat beside me on the plane, fiddling with my iPhone. “I don’t understand how your taste in music can be so bad. We’ve been friends for years. Have I taught you nothing?”  
  
  “To not drink tequila. ”  
  
  She rolled her eyes.  
  
  Above our heads the seatbelt sign flashed on. A polite voice advised us to return our seats to the upright position as we’d be landing in a few minutes. I swallowed the dregs of my shitty plane coffee with a wince. Fact was, no amount of caffeine could help me today. Quality didn’t even come into it.  
  
  “I am deadly serious,” I said. “I’m also never setting foot in Nevada ever again so long as I live. ”  
  
  “Now there’s an overreaction. ”  
  
  “Not even a little, lady. ”  
  
  Lauren had stumbled back to the motel a bare two hours before our flight was due to leave. I’d spent the time re-packing my small bag over and over in an attempt to get my life back into some semblance of order. It was good to see Lauren smiling, though getting to the airport in time had been a race. Apparently she and the cute waiter she’d met would be keeping in touch. Lauren had always been great with guys, while I was more closely related to your standard garden-variety wallflower. My plan to get laid in Vegas had been a deliberate attempt to get out of that rut. So much for that idea.  
  
  Lauren was studying economics and she was gorgeous, inside and out. I was more kind of unwieldy. It was why I made a habit of walking everywhere I could in Portland and trying not to sample the contents of the cake display case at the café where I worked. It kept me manageable, waist-wise. Though my Mom still saw fit to give me lectures on the subject because God forbid I dare put sugar in my coffee. My thighs would no doubt explode or something.  
  
  Lauren had three older brothers and knew what to say to guys. Nothing intimidated her. The girl oozed charm. I had one older brother but we no longer inte  
racted outside of major family holidays. Not since he moved out of home four years back leaving only a note. Nathan had a temper and a gift for getting into trouble. He’d been the bad boy in high school, always getting into fights and skipping classes. Though blaming my lack of success with guys on my non-existent relationship with my brother was wrong. I could own my deficiencies with the opposite sex. Mostly.  
  
  “Listen to this. ” Lauren plugged my earphones into her phone and the whine of electric guitars exploded inside my skull. The pain was exquisite. My headache roared back to sudden, horrific life. Nothing remained of my brain but bloody red mush. Of this I was certain.  
  
  I ripped out the earphones. “Don’t. Please. ”  
  
  “But that’s Stage Dive. ”  
  
  “And they’re lovely. But, you know, another time maybe. ”  
  
  “I worry about you sometimes. I just want you to know that. ”  
  
  “There is nothing wrong with country music played softly. ”  
  
  Lauren snorted and fluffed up her short dark hair. “There is nothing right with country music played at any volume. So what did you get up to last night? Apart from spending quality time heaving?”  
  
  “Actually, that about sums it up. ” The less said the better. How could I ever explain? Still, guilt slid through me and I squirmed in my seat. The tattoo throbbed in protest.  
  
  I hadn’t told Lauren about my grand having-good-sex plan for the night. She’d have wanted to help. Honestly, sex didn’t strike me as the sort of thing you should have help with. Apart from what was required from the sexual partner in question, of course. Lauren’s assistance would have involved foisting me on every hottie in the room with promises of my immediate leg-open availability.  
  
  I loved Lauren and her loyalty was above question, but she didn’t have a subtle bone in her body. She’d punched a girl in the nose in fifth grade for teasing me about my weight and we’d been friends ever since. With Lauren, you always knew exactly where you stood. Something I appreciated the bulk of the time, just not when discretion was called for.  
  
  Happily, my sore stomach survived the bumpy landing. Soon as those wheels hit the tarmac I let out a sigh of relief. I was back in my hometown. Beautiful Oregon, lovely Portland, never again would I stray. With mountains in the distance and trees in the city, she was a singular delight. To limit myself to the one city for life might indeed be going overboard. But it was great to be home. I had an all-important internship starting next week that my father had pulled strings to get for me. There were also next semester’s classes to start planning for.

Hey remote workers and students!

Felix here, excited to kick off our new blog where we share the gear we ***actually*** **use** and truly trust. Whether you're a **remote worker juggling client calls from a cafe**, or a **student powering through lectures and study sessions on the go**, you know the feeling: that creeping dread when your device battery dips low. Today, we're diving into an item that has consistently saved me from that exact scenario, no matter where I am: \*\*my 20000mAh, 100W Power Bank.\*\*This isn't just another gadget; it's practically my portable command center, my lifeline on countless excursions. The photo above speaks volumes, right? Those scuffs and scratches are a badge of honor – proof of thousands of hours of work, travel, and consistent power, **no matter where I am**.

**Why this is my absolute must-have for seamless workflow:**

* **Unrivaled Portability & Reliability:** I've taken this power bank *everywhere*. From coffee shops with scarce outlets to long-haul flights and impromptu remote work spots – it effortlessly keeps my laptop, phone, and tablet charged. In the car during commutes? Check. Need a quick top-up at the office without being tied to a wall? Double-check.
* **Monster Capacity (20000mAh):** This thing just keeps going. I can get at least one full charge for my MacBook Pro and multiple charges for my phone. It completely eliminates battery anxiety when I'm in the middle of something critical.
* **Powerful Output (100W):** This is the game-changer for me. The 100W output means it's not just fast-charging phones; it's powerful enough to efficiently juice up my laptop as if it were plugged into a wall outlet. That's pure efficiency, right there.
* **Built to Endure (Seriously):** As you can tell, it's taken some knocks. Yet, it powers on flawlessly. And a huge shout-out to the included cloth case – without it, the cosmetic damage would be far more significant. A small detail that makes a huge difference in durability.

This power bank has proven itself an absolute essential for my productivity, no matter where my work takes me. It's the silent hero ensuring I stay connected and productive, always.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ipo1eg/i_hate_that_my_bf_is_going_out_for_drinks_with/) **February 15, 2025**

I have no problem with my bf going out for drinks with his ex. They broke up many years ago, she lives away and is visiting for a week or so. They didn't have a bad breakup, it was bad timing and they've stayed in contact since. She seems like a nice person.

I also don't do Valentines Day. I don't like getting presents or spending time with someone because they feel obligated to. I want that stuff to be natural and because it's wanted, not because it's forced. I don't expect today to be any different than any other day.

But the two lining up does suck. It sucks that I'm here alone, watching everyone do posts about Valentines day and watching what everyone is doing, and he's out with his ex. It's not that I automatically think he's cheating or that it's romantic, or that its wrong. He messaged me saying it's weird and so nice to see her. It just sucks.

And I hate that I feel like crying. I hate Valentines Day, I've never ever had a good one, it always feels like shit. I don't want to celebrate it, I don't want to be a jealous gf, I don't want to feel so lonely, I just don't want this.

But ultimately I'm not going to say anything. And I know that's my fault and my failings. So instead I'm just going to be at home alone and cry.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Mmoct**

>Why didn’t you just tell him it bothered you? It’s very weird that he’s out with an ex on Valentine’s Day, whether you celebrate it or not. They are going up surround by people in love, while you’re at home. Why would he go out with an ex on Valentine’s Day? That is so disrespectful

**OOP**

>>He told me a few days ago she was coming to visit for something in town. He said he wanted to go coffee with her to caught up some time. He was working till 7pm this evening and we didn't make any plans. He been saying he wants to dinner at some point but has yet to arrange that. He just sort of messaged me saying ""finished work, going out to drink with ""ex"" then going home"". He's still out with her. Didn't really give me a chance to say anything. Going out for coffee some time and going out for drinks on Valentines Day is very different things. I just feel like a fucking idiot

**CreasingUnicorn**

>Yea as much as the ex issue is with OPs partner, this sounds like OP set themselves up for failure here. 

>Partner: ""Hey babe do you want to do something special for valentines day?""

>OP: ""No, I hate valentines day, it sucks!""

>Partner: ""Okie dokie""

>OP: ""why does nobody treat me on valentines day?""

>OP If you want something then you have to say something, people are not mind readers, and especially in this case wherr you specifically said the opposite of what you wanted. You need to end this self fulfilling prophecy or else you will just keep being dissapointed

>>He didn't ask if I wanted to do anything for Valentines. I don't like presents, for birthdays or Christmas or anything. But he also didn't ask. He said he wanted to take me out for dinner some time, but has yet to arrange that.

>>I know I need to arrange stuff too, but I've got shit going on in my life meaning I'm kind of housebound without someone with me and I can't drive (no taxis where I live).

>>He said he wanted to go out for coffee with her sometime to catch up, not drinks on Valentines night. Idk, I know there's been some miscommunication but this feels overkill. But it also feels like my fault

**tinyshroomy**

>Anyone notice that OP is poly? lmao he’s fucking her. he’s literally allowed.

**OOP**

>>We are poly, but we have a ""no exs or friends"" rule, and we have to tell each other before something gets physical. I don't know if this is a romantic date or not. If it is that would still be classed as cheating in our relationship.

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ipo1eg/comment/mcx538z/?context=3) **(Same day)**

So update for people to kind of explain my headspace:

I feel worthless. So I didn't recognise how letting lots of little things go was things I actually cared about. Until last night, I felt hurt but felt I shouldn't be allowed to.

He's not a bad guy, he just is stupid and oblivious to how he makes me feel sometimes. And that's not his fault, I can't communicate my feelings because I feel I have no right to them.

I have a lot of issues and am really messed up. I'm still figuring that out. I want to be in therapy but that's not available where I am. I am disabled with no ability to work or go private.

It came to a head last night because I realised I was hurt and angry, but immediately shut those feelings down. And I guess I finally realised I shouldn't do that.

I've told him we need a break. That I don't know how to proceed. That yes he often makes me feel worthless, because he says nice things and says things he wants to do, but actually does the opposite. My bf loves in words, not actions. I feel love in actions, not words.

And yes, I am poly. I've been in happy poly relationships before because I struggle with monogamous relationships. I hate feeling trapped and dependent. But that was when I had other things in my life that made me feel worthwhile too, when I could work and have goals. And just because we're poly doesn't mean we don't have rules, friends, family and exs are still cheating. It isn't all or nothing.

This wasn't about cheating though, it was about how worthless I feel and realising I shouldn't have to. That just because I don't want big gestures doesn't mean I don't need small consistencies.

I'm autistic and very traumatised by my past, communication skills are not something I was taught. I was taught to be quiet and not make other people upset or angry at you because that's not nice. That I don't love how normal people love, so I should just accept what is given.

But you can't really be in a relationship when you shut down all expectations and don't communicate what you actually need. I know he wants to work on things, but that involves me learning like basic human relationship skills. I know the logical answers to problems, I don't know how to feel them and express them.

I feel I've been pushed so far back in the priority of his life, and I've let him because I don't feel I deserve anything more. And I don't know how to come back from it.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**oyagerK19**

>If your communication and relationship skills are terrible, then maybe just maybe you shouldn't be in a relationship. Since you're so traumatized and you're recognizing it, I don't know how you figured any relationship would work be so for real.

**OOP**

>>Yeah I know. I thought I was doing better. I didn't want a relationship, I told him that. But I pushed that aside to take a chance because he said he fell in love with me. And he's been patient with me. And I guess I just thought it's better to take what is given than expect more. But it's not. I don't communicate, I need actions, not words. He gives words but no action. It's hard admitting you're not aro but also not being capable of a proper relationship.

**Update 2, Feburay 20 (5 days later, on the original post)**

UPDATE: I already did a mini one of these immediately morning after but damn has it been a rough couple of days. So yeah, this post was a problem. I have been annoyed at him and myself. He fucked up and so did I. It was never about whether I thought he was cheating, I know he didn't cheat and I don't think he will (yes, we're poly, but we still have the ability to cheat on each other by breaking rules we have in place, like no exs). This was more about realising I felt very unloved and worthless. Not because of this one act but because of months of his lack of actions and a year of degrading health that has taken away everything that gave me meaning and made me feel worthwhile.

When I got the message that he wanted to take me to dinner but hasn't planned, a dinner he had wanted to take me on for over a month but never found the time to, but found the time to suddenly go out for drinks with someone else, it hurt and I didn't understand why. It wasn't because it was Valentines Day, it was because I'd seen everyone talk about how they felt loved and I realised I didn't. Because at the same time I was planning a mini trip for his month next month and realised he wouldn't do the same for me if he couldn't even arrange a dinner or an evening together that wasn't just on the sofa. That just because this activity didn't have an immediate deadline didn't mean it wasn't important. And I realised through this post my immediate reaction to that was to push it down and not say anything. Which makes me stupid and pathetic.

So yes I have told my bf how I feel. It's not about big gestures, it's not about who he choose to spend his time with, it's about the fact he couldn't find the time to spend with me. That if he wanted to be with me, he would have been before this point. Saying you want to be with someone, do things with someone, but constantly fail to do them is a problem.

I've also got a lot of work to do with my own self worth and communication ability. I lack a lot of the basic skills of recognising my emotions and being able to communicate them. There's many reasons for this, not excuses but what has created this situation. I need to get better at that for myself, but also for anyone I am attempting to have a relationship with.

Me and my bf have taken a couple days apart to think about where we want to go from here. Ultimately talking about the state of relationship is only part of the solution, what's more important is the actions we take going forward. I need to be more vocal in recognising my wants and feelings, he needs to show me that he loves me and wants to be with me, not just tell me.

I know people are going to be angry I'm not just immediately breaking up with him. But this was never about cheating. Relationships breaking down aren't always about that, a lot of the time it's more nuanced then that. And worrying someone else is cheating is often more about the lack of self worth than what is actually happening.

I also don't believe you can't be friends with exs. I also strongly don't believe men and woman can't be friends. This is a very cis-het view on relationships and people. If you can't be friends with people you are potentially attracted to, how the hell do you think bi and gay people exist? I'm bi, and in the circles I have known, this is never an issue. If you can't see people you've had sex with or the people you have the potential to want to have sex with as only objects of sex, that's a problem with how you view fellow humans. I'm not in competition with everyone he's been with and can potentially be with, as he isn't to me; a relationship between two people is about those two people.

For those who are saying I need therapy, 100% agree and am trying, but where I live and lack of ability to work is making that very difficult. The NHS is only bothered if you are suicidal, or if you can be in the workforce, and where I live on a remote island where there are no private options. So I'm learning these things myself with very little guidance. Realising the difficulty of this and the toll its taking on me is a factor completely of its own too.

I don't know if we'll stay together, it depends on the coming weeks and probably months on whether we can get this stuff sorted and make progress to communicate better and give each other what we both are needing. Won't be updating on here anyway regardless. Thanks for the people trying to actually help and listen, not just jumping to insult me or make me feel worse. Thanks to the people reaching out through messages too, this situation has taken a physical toll on me too where I've spend the last 2 days in bed with a migraine not eating, so just haven't had the energy to make conversation.

I'll do better for myself and expect more from my partner. I'd rather be alone and happy than in a relationship and constantly disappointed. So our relationship is on trail to see if it'll work. Small consistencies will determine that, not big gestures. Ultimately I think it can be summed up with ""just because I don't require much doesn't mean I don't deserve the bare minimum"", both for how I treat myself and how others who care for me treat me.

**A Hailstorm of Knitting Needles:** Polished mahogany and black tea with a clatter of vanilla husk and oak wood.

**Advanced Manifestations for Members Only:** A clandestine assembly of elite ghost-seekers: smoky oud, fiery crimson peppercorn, and wild patchouli swirl in a heady haze, unfolding through plush velvet labdanum, lush plum damask, molten beeswax, and a glimmer of cognac spilled over a cracked quartz sphere.

**All Worlds are in Motion:** The divine spark from which all things emanate; the perfume of the profound, unseen forces that connect us to the cosmos: the cold brilliance of metallic aldehydes, lemon pith, ambergris accord, and white lavender tethered to terrestrial patchouli, violet leaf, and a mineralic musk.

**Claircognizance 2024**: Absolute and perfect clarity: rockrose, white amber, Corsican immortelle, Siamese benzoin, white sandalwood, and life everlasting.

**Practical Occultism 2024**: A Victorian occultist’s incense, invoking the Four Archangels: precious wildcrafted Indian frankincense with myrrh, cassia, sandarac, palmarosa, white sage, red sandalwood, elemi, and drops of star anise bound with grains of kyphi.

**Psychodynamic Discharge 2024**: Repressed rage, terror, and subjugated sexuality erupting through fierce bursts of uncontrollable psychic phenomena: black leather and red musk with aged black patchouli, Chinese rose, black pepper, coconut meat, Haitian vetiver, and igneous red ginger.

**Spirit Board 2024:** Redwood and bois de rose with white lilac, dried pink roses, and black tea.

**The Fox Sisters 2024:** Deception and despair: rose geranium and tea roses with mahogany wood, bourbon vanilla, and apple peel.

**The Phenomena of Witchcraft**: Green balsam, bay leaf, fossilized amber, blackened vetiver, and clove bud cloaked in oud.

**Where are the Dead:** An unsettling dance of ethereal murmurs, with ghostly wormwood drifting through the husky warmth of cardamom — a whisper in a shadowed corridor. Hazy lavender and velvety orris cast an otherworldly glow in the darkened corners.

**Who Would Not Tremble, Too? 2024**: A spirit-touched courtship: sweet orange blossom, white honey, jasmine tea, white sandalwood, green apple, and lily of the valley.

**Eighteenth Lash**: Vanillekipferl plunked in a pile of pine needles.

**Fifteenth Lash:** Black leather, coal dust, scorched cedarwood, and incense ash.

**Fourteenth Lash:** Cacao, scorched patchouli, roasted chestnuts, and champaca absolute.

**Krampus 2024:** Be good, or Krampus will toss you in a river! Sinister red musk, black leather, dusty rags, and wooden switches.

**Lavender Prickly Pear Shaved Ice:** Runnels of darkly translucent purple syrup sinking into a dome of creamy-fine snow scrapings.

**Midnight Marzipan Perfume Oil:** A Winter Solstice gourmand: a ground almond snowpack glistening under a chilly scattering of sugar-bright stars, standing out against a night sky of the darkest cacao.

**Strawberry Bonbon:** A hard candy for hard times: bright, sticky berry with an extra crystalline sparkle and just a pinch of grit.

**Vintage Snow Clown Blow Mold:** Chase away the sads with a sip from a cheery snowglobe filled with slushy grenadine and lemon-lime soda, topped with a maraschino cherry and illuminated from within by 40 watts of glowing amber.

I’m looking to connect with someone genuinely. Someone who enjoys writing longer messages about their day, sharing random photos of things that catch their eye, or watching something we enjoy together. I once met one of my best friends on this app, but life and time zones eventually pulled us apart. I’m hoping lightning can strike twice.

**What I’m looking for:**

* Someone close to my age (I’m 37), though I’m open if we connect well
* Someone who replies with more than one-word answers
* Someone non-judgmental, open-minded, and interested in building something real
* Someone open with their thoughts and personality — I’m an open book myself
* Location isn’t important as long as we can make time for each other

**A bit about me:**

* I live on the West Coast, US
* I’m introverted and prefer meaningful one-on-one conversations over group chats or big social settings.
* I spend a lot of time with family and recently started collecting Pokémon cards with my nephew and godson — it’s become our bonding obsession.
* My sense of humor is dry and dark — not for everyone, but people who get it usually enjoy it (or at least they say they do)
* I take my coffee black, and I’m always down for tacos
* I’ve wanted to get into anime and TV shows, but have trouble watching them alone. It’s way more enjoyable with someone else
* Honestly, there should be a site just for pairing up with people to watch shows together
* I’m obsessed with Sudoku and love watching Cracking the Cryptic on YouTube. I also enjoy reaction videos, puzzle games, and board games
* If you’re into co-op gaming, great. If not, that’s fine too — we’ll still get along

I’m putting this out there because I’m tired of feeling alone. The older I get, the more I realize how much I value shared experiences and meaningful connections.

There’s no pressure or expectations here. If something clicks, it clicks.

Also, I understand that appearance matters to some people. If you’d like to exchange photos at some point, I’m open to that.

Feel free to message me if anything here sounds like your vibe. I prefer using Discord, but I’m okay chatting here.",1,1749928038.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

(2024)","Hello everyone! As always, I wanted to thank you for all your comments and votes under my last post about Namrud ""Rudy"" Tessema- I hope that he will be found soon.

  
Today I bring you another case of someone mysteriously vanishing in the woods.

  
BACKGROUND

  
Danielle Evelyn Lopez was 37 when she went missing from Woodland Township, New Jersey, USA. 

  
She grew up in Westchester, Pennsylvania, raised by her single mother, Sue Quackenbush. Danielle was a good student and used to be a cheerleader. She was a middle child and had two brothers who have both died- her older brother died by suicide on Chrismas Day in 2015, and her younger brother died in a car crash only 10 months later.

  
At the time, Danielle was living with her paternal grandfather in Delran, New Jersey. The two were very close and frequently travelled together. In 2013, they were featured in a local newspaper in an article about how they bridged the generational gap. Sadly, in 2020, her grandfather had passed due to COVID, and her father died just a month after. Around the same time, Danielle made a heartbreaking decision to put down her old dog, Roscoe, who she loved very much. Sue said that Danielle struggled with grief, but she seemed to be doing all right before she went missing.

  
Danielle was in a relationship with a man named James Scott Dunn. They were together for seven years by the time of her disappearance, but they were dating on and off. Sue didn't think that James was a good partner for her daughter, as he was significantly older and had convictions for theft and drug-related crimes.

  
She was known to frequent Brendan T. Byrne State Forest as well as Pemberton Township and Willingboro.

  
Sue said that her daughter was ""sweet, creative, and loving"", and that she was ""a wonderful daughter and a vibrant light in (her) life"". Danielle was ""very kind, always thinking of someone else. Loved her family"" and ""bubbly, loved singing karaoke"".

  
DISAPPEARANCE

  
Before she went missing, on the evening of the 12th of April, Danielle told her mother that she planned to go camping with James. The conversation was ""wonderful"" according to Sue, they ""spoke about a lot of things"", and Danielle ""was upbeat and happy at the time"". Danielle used to camp as a child, but Sue wouldn't describe her as a ""frequent camper"" as an adult.

  
Danielle was last seen on the 13th of April, leaving the Wawa (seems to be a conveniance store) on Route 72 in the Vincentown section of Southampton in Burlington County at around 9 AM. She was caught on the store's security camera as she was leaving with ""someone"" (The investigators seem to know who it is but don't want to share their identity). Danielle allegedly looked ""good"" (as in not distressed or depressed) on the video.

  
At 6 PM, a couple driving by spotted Danielle walking on Lost Lane in Penn State Forest in Woodland in southern Burlington County, around 12 miles (19 km) away from the campground. They chatted briefly; During their conversation, Danielle told them that she was looking at the trees and drove into the puddle by accident. She asked them for help with pushing her car out, but the couple told her to try catch someone else by the main road, and Danielle agreed. The interaction was caught on their GoPro, and it was shared with the investigators. The couple have actually passed Danielle earlier than that too- when she was driving, allegedly alone; That was also recorded on their GoPro. In the recording where they interacted, Danielle seemed ""lucid, coherent, and OK"", according to Sue. She also had her phone in her hand, but it's unknown if she had cell service; Sue seems to believe that Danielle was calm because she called someone to come help already. In the video, Danielle was wearing different clothes than the ones she wore in the Wawa video.

  
Danielle was reported missing by her mother, Sue, when she stopped responding to her calls. Sue noticed on her Wawa app that Danielle has bought a coffee in one of their stores (the two shared their account) and gave that info to the police.  

  
Her car, a 2008 2-door blue Hyundai Accent, was later found by the police, disabled, on Lost Lane Road in Penn State Forest, Woodland Township on the 1st of May, which is right where the interaction with the couple took place. Sue drove out to the place the car was found, and she claims that there's ""no way"" Danielle would drive out there. Inside, some ""personal items"" were found, along with the clothes Danielle was wearing in the Wawa video. The battery was dead, and the car had to be jumpstarted- after that, the hazard lights turned on. There was no sign of suspicious activity around the car.

  
Danielle's phone hasn't been found, and her bank accounts have been inactive.

  
Her boyfriend has been interviewed about the case. He said that he last saw Danielle on the morning of 13th of April. As of 15th of September 2024, he was in state prison for unrelated charges. Multiple other people who have been around Danielle shortly before she went missing, including the person that was with her at Wawa, were also interviewed. There are no official suspects named.

  
CONCLUSION



Sue implies that police have lead her to believe that they are most likely looking for Danielle's remains, and seems to believe that her daughter is dead, and that foul play might've been involved.

  
James was reportedly ""devastated"" by Danielle's disappearance. He says that he wasn't on the campground on the night she disappeared, and returned in the morning after she was gone. He says that the investigators should focus on a camper that had been allegedly bothering Danielle whenever he wasn't around.

  
After the loss of her sons, Sue joined an organization called [Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors](https://www.taps.org/) (TAPS), where she recieved help from a peer mentor. She's giving back to the program by mentoring mothers who have also lost multiple children. After Danielle went missing, the organization is offering her all the help they can offer.

  
There is a 5,000$ reward for ""the direct location or information leading to (Danielle's) direct location"" available untill the midnight of the 31st of July.



Danielle Evelyn Lopez was 37 when she went missing, and would be 38 now. She is a white woman, 5'4"" (64 Inch / 163 cm) and 135 lbs (62 kg). She has blue/green eyes and brown hair. She has a slight scar on her upper lip, and her ears are pierced. 

  
If you have any info regarding Danielle's wherabouts, contact the New Jersey State Police - Red Lion at (609) 859-2282 (case number H660-2024-00052).

1lbge8l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lbge8l,Am I being scammed by the shop?,"Hey,

My Eureka Mignon Zero had some problems and I sent back to the shop for warranty.

They said that they can’t solve the issue and must send it to Eureka, but they will give me a new one in replacement (other color). BUT, they told me they opened it and used it for 19g of coffee for a test in parallel while trying to repair my grinder.

I accepted, but when it arrived I noticed two things:
- it had the accessories from my old grinder instead of new ones
- I noticed some scratches on the burrs’ bolt and under the Eureka plate.

I’m wondering if these scratches look normal to you?

Combined with the fact they didn’t give me new accessories it makes me think there’s something fishy.

Thanks?

I feel like 20mg may be slightly low so I tried 30mg today and it was much better. I do not do it to ‘feel’ it, I adjusted the dose because my general symptoms began to come back (distracted and couldn’t focus much on work, restless and forgetful). I was wondering and thinking of a few things. 
1. Is it recommended to continue taking 30mg or keep to 20 until I see my psychiatrist in a few days? 
2. Maximum dose (generally safe) in a day, usually take 20mg 3 times a day, don’t know if 30mg 3 times is too much (90mg a day which in about 10mg over what doctor told me was ‘rough’ maximum (5’6, male, 18, skinny (assuming i have fast metabolism) 
3. Latest time to take last dose and effect on sleep (if I take my dose at 8pm would i be able to sleep by 12-1:30?)  
4. Could I have coffee with it, have in the past without issues and regularly drink it but been told that there are some issues surrounding that topic. 
Thanks in advance and no I will not take this as straight ‘medical advice’ just general suggestions and advice until I see my doctor in a few days (have exams in a week so need to get work done and don’t really have time to wait to talk to them).

I’m on the hunt for the **best possible clone of Kilian’s Angel’s Share** — that *intoxicating* boozy, apple-cinnamon-vanilla pie blend with a warm woody drydown. I’ve tried a couple hyped dupes but I’m honestly disappointed so far:

**❌ Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa** – way too sweet and synthetic. Smells more like a hazelnut coffee dessert than a cognac-apple-cinnamon vibe. It’s nice… but not what I’m chasing.

**❌ Aariz Intense by Arabiyat Prestige** – nothing like Angel’s Share. Almost a different DNA entirely. Weak booziness, barely any apple or cinnamon pie warmth, more of a basic oriental scent.

What I’m looking for is a **true 1:1 dupe** — something that:

* Opens with that **boozy cognac hit**
* Has that **sweet cinnamon-apple pie heart**
* Dries down with **tonka/vanilla/oak warmth**
* Doesn’t smell like burnt syrup or playdough 🙃
* Actually performs decently and doesn't fall apart in the drydown

So far, I’ve heard **Fragrance World Royal Blend (Extrait or Bourbon)** is really close — any truth to that? Some say it’s 95% there, but I’m curious if anyone has **blind-tested it side-by-side with the OG**.

Also heard a few whispers about:

* Paris Corner Emir ""Fire Your Desire""
* Maison Alhambra Khamrah Original (not Qahwa)
* Oil perfumers like **Alexandria’s Apple Crumb** or **Dua’s Angels of Sin**

**If you’ve found the closest thing to Angel’s Share, what is it and why?**  
I’m willing to pay more if it nails that sexy, gourmand, boozy magic that gets compliments and makes people lean in.

Thanks for any help — this is easily one of the most addictive DNAs I’ve ever smelled and I’m dying to find a wearable daily clone without shelling €200+ for the OG every time.",1,1749927871.0,fragranceclones,6,0.67,False

I've always loved the vintage Seamaster 300, and thought I'd share my recent budget build. I had done a bit of seiko modding in the past but have been inspired by the posts here.

Used a Hruodland aliexpress case, still using the NH35 and hands that came with it for simplicity and to keep costs down. Ordered a white raffles dial and with a bit of time baking with coffee grounds it matched the hands and bezel fairly decently. Could maybe use a bit more time but this was my first attempt and I didn't want to over do it.

Haven't done any aging to the case yet, still need to sand off the caseback laser engraving to give more of a sterile look. I'm considering doing another build with an 2824 and date dial with further aging done.

I just got some new curling shampoo/conditioner/gel/creme and want to try it but I don't know whether doing it at 8pm is a good idea? I do have a silk sleep hat I wear would this keep the curls in place and unaffected if I wear?  
My hair is so frizzy so I usually wear it anyway but I have never tried anything like this shampoo etc before and my hair is curly but can never get it to curl properly due to the frizz and what not so yeah I can do it in the morning but I start work at 10am so not sure by the time I get up at 8am have something to eat, coffee, make up and then doing all that..actually I'm sure I wont have enough time :(

Note.. it's just me..  One person. 

I've used a JetBoil Press attachment..  it worked but I don't use the JetBoil much when basecampjng.

I have an AeroPress which is easy enough, but the cup size is anemic.  Haven't found an easy way to do multiple cups and even if I could..  two servings in one mug isn't enough for most mornings.

Maybe a larger French press?

I just purchased a Coletti Bozeman six cup percolator. It's beautiful.  Physical size is good;  It fits in my camp kitchen box and I can nest a few things like filters, scoop etc inside the pot.  It doubles as a regular pot if I need to boil water for soup or in the rare instance I have a dehydrated meal.  It can go on a burner or directly on the fire.  The amount it perks is good, but definitely need to make two pots.  The physical size of the nine cup was too large to fit in my kitchen box.  Downside is it takes quite a while to brew.  My at-home test required twelve minutes from start to pour.  About 7 minutes to first boil and then five perk'ng.  The real challenge is that after twelve minutes of prep time it still needs to sit to drain from the grinds and even then it is far to hot to enjoy.  

I was using a GSI Infinity mug but am thinking I might switch to an insulated mug like a Yeti or HydroFlask and chill the cup while the coffee is brewing but that feels backwards.

1lbg0qi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lbg0qi,Vintage Florentine wooden box-style coffee grinder - found USA,"Don’t need a valuation (I know it’s not worth much), just looking for more information on this style. I’ve gone down a total rabbit hole looking up vintage Florentine. Something about the intersection of fancy, gaudy and shabby really appeals to me, I guess. If anyone wants to see some examples of what I’m talking about, you could check out the Pinterest collection I started [here](https://www.pinterest.com/arbitress419/furniture-decor-objets-dart/florentine/) (or you could just google “vintage Florentine”).

I picked up this coffee grinder/spice mill at a thrift store in Los Angeles, California, USA. My initial Google searches on this didn’t turn up anything similar, but eventually I found some other box-style coffee grinders with gold paint on eBay, and I noticed the word Florentine in the listing titles. Lo and behold, there’s a ton of jewelry/trinket boxes and housewares on eBay and Etsy with similar patterns, even the same turquoise-gold diamond pattern. [This jewelry box](https://www.ebay.com/itm/376261867346) is a dead ringer style-wise.

Except for [this blog post](https://edithandevelynvintage.com/decorating-with-italian-florentine/) there doesn’t seem to be much information on vintage Florentine on the internet. Apparently it’s also called Italian Florentine, which seems rather redundant. Sounds like it has roots that go back centuries, but most of this stuff was made in Florence in the 20th century, and it was particularly popular when Hollywood Regency was in vogue.

Looking at my coffee grinder, the craftsmanship seems a bit sloppy. The gold diamonds aren’t all  aligned. That, combined with the “Made in Italy” on the bottom, makes me think that some of these wares were made cheaply and marketed to English-speaking tourists. It’s easy to imagine tourist traps along the Arno overflowing with this stuff. Does anyone know was such a thing as upscale Florentine? Some of the vintage Florentine furniture is highly valued today— as long as it’s wood, not plastic— but that doesn’t necessarily mean it's high-quality. Also, I’m curious to know if actual residents of Florence were buying this stuff or if it was all pretty much meant for tourists.

Since the water flow through the brew group of my Gaggia has been very weak for quite a while now and the cleaning method often recommended here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1x71NHsecU) and the removal and cleaning of the solenoid valve have not brought any improvement, I now wanted to remove the entire boiler and clean everything completely. As I didn't have such a long Allen key, I was only able to separate the boiler and the brew group after I had taken everything out. Unfortunately, the screws were so tight that the boiler slipped off the table while I was trying to loosen them and two of the four connections (or whatever they're called) broke/bent along with the ceramic around them, so I'll probably have to replace the boiler completely now. 

My first choice would have been the standard aluminium boiler for €50, but I've also considered getting a new brass boiler, but I'm a bit put off by the price of €180. So I would like to know your opinion. Is the extra cost worth it? Does anyone have the new brass boiler (who previously had the old aluminium boiler) and can share their experience as to whether it makes a noticeable difference and is worth it?

I know this will be too long for most of you to want to read, but it amused me.

**Prompt to AI: Write the plot of a movie based on the video game Fortnite about a player who is over 40. It should be a comedy and in the style of Douglas Adams.**

**Logline**

When a hapless office worker gets sucked into a battle royale video game, he must survive 99 other players—most of whom are way better at this than he is—while dealing with the world's most incompetent cosmic bureaucrats.

**Chapter 1: In which Dave discovers it’s not just reality that has customer service issues**

**Dave Thompson** is a 45-year-old accountant who's terrible at video games but plays them anyway to bond with his teenage nephew. During a particularly embarrassing Fortnite session where he dies within seconds a power surge somehow digitizes him into the actual game.

Dave materializes on the island in his business suit and immediately gets confused by 99 other players who are taking this way too seriously. There’s **xXSniperGod420Xx** (actually a 12-year-old named Timmy), **BuildMaster9000** (a hyper-caffeinated architecture student), and **TTV\_NoobSlayer** (who won't stop asking people to follow her Twitch channel).

A booming voice can be heard announcing the next game is about to start. The voice belongs to **Gary-7**, a mid-level cosmic bureaucrat who drew the short straw in the Interdimensional Entertainment Division. Gary-7's job is to announce the rules with appropriate gravitas, but he's been doing this for so long he has developed the sort of terminal boredom usually reserved for immortal beings stuck in customer service positions.

The cosmic bureaucracy running Fortnite operates from a dimension that exists primarily in the filing cabinets of middle management. **Gary-7** reports to **Linda-42**, who handles customer complaints (there are no customers, but the forms still need to be filed) There is also **Bob-∞,** Manager of the IT department (which consists entirely of Bob-∞) who accidentally created the Battle Royale system while trying to set up the office WiFi.

Their operation is overseen by **Supreme Administrator Karen** a being of such concentrated bureaucratic authority that she once issued a formal reprimand to God himself for creating the universe without filing the proper environmental impact assessment.

Dave quickly discovers that the island operates on principles that make quantum mechanics look straightforward. Trees can be punched into neat stacks of wood, rocks can be harvested like fruit, and everyone possesses an inexplicable ability to construct elaborate fortifications in seconds - Apart from him. His first construction attempt results in what can only be described as an architectural impossibility—a structure that exists in four dimensions but provides protection in none of them.

Dave’s weapon choices are terrible too (who picks up a fishing rod in a gunfight?), but through sheer dumb luck and the incompetence of others, he survives to the last 10 players in his first match despite getting no eliminations.

 **Act II: Squad up , servers down**

Dave teams up with **Samantha**, a soccer mom who got sucked into the game during her son's birthday party and has become surprisingly good at eliminating opponents with her ""extreme parenting skills."" Their third teammate is **Professor Wilkins**, an elderly academic who treats every match like a fascinating sociological experiment and provides running commentary on everyone's behavior.

The game system runs on what Bob-∞ calls ""Aggressive Probability Management""—a technology that works by assuming everything will go wrong and then being pleasantly surprised when it doesn't. This explains why players occasionally transform into poultry, weapons sometimes fire birthday confetti, and the storm once moved sideways for three hours when Bob-∞ spilled coffee on the servers.

Dave learns that winners don't actually get anything—Bob forgot to program rewards into the system. The ""Victory Royale"" is literally just Gary eating a microwave burrito while half-heartedly saying ""congratulations, I guess.""

The corporate overlords' boss, **Supreme Administrator Karen**, arrives for a surprise inspection and threatens to shut down the whole operation unless they can prove it's generating proper entertainment value. This means the battle royale needs to actually work correctly for once.

**Act III: The Ultimate Noob Victory**

Gary, Linda, and Bob realize they need Dave to win a match to impress their boss, but Dave is still terrible at the game. They start secretly helping him—Gary warns him about other players, Linda hacks supply drops to give him better loot, and Bob strategically crashes other players' connections.

Meanwhile, the real players are getting increasingly frustrated with the glitches and start forming an alliance to ""break the game"". Dave finds himself caught between helping his cosmic overlord friends keep their jobs and joining the player rebellion as Supreme Administrator Karen growing increasingly suspicious of Gary's nervous explanations.

Everything goes wrong at the same time. Dave accidentally activates every glitch at once, and Karen realizes the whole operation is held together with cosmic duct tape and hope. The island becomes a surreal nightmare of dancing hot dogs, backwards storms, chicken transformations, and structures that build themselves.

The game world begins to fold in on itself like a cosmic origami project and the other ninety-eight players respond with panic. They run in circles, attempt to build panic rooms and fire indiscriminately at anything that moves.

Dave, however, responds to the cosmic meltdown with the sort of calm resignation that comes from years of working in an accounts office. While the island reorganizes itself around him Dave simply hides in a bush until he observes there are only three other players left, engaged in a Mexican standoff. As all three open fire on each other they are eliminated simultaneously. In the chaos Dave finds himself the accidental winner. His victory dance is interrupted by the system finally crashing completely, ejecting everyone back to reality. In the distance Bob’s voice can be heard saying “Well this is going to require a lot of paperwork”

**Epilogue**

Dave returns to his normal life but discovers he's retained some of his (admittedly limited) gaming skills. His nephew is impressed that Uncle Dave finally got a Victory Royale, not knowing the cosmic bureaucracy that made it possible.",4,1749926413.0,Fortnite_Over40,6,0.63,False

Now the not so sexy, but very important stuff:

Clean record, 3 owners, first being Rogers Cable. As a fleet vehicle she was impeccably maintained. Owner before us never got around to building it out, but kept it garaged and well maintained too. Because of this, she has relatively low mileage for her age, and these engines will last up to 500,000 km if taken care of.

We have kept up with regular maintenance (oil and filter changes) and made some repairs as they have come up. 

2021 - All new brake pads and rotors, New Tires, New Battery, New Muffler

2022 - New rear differential pinion seal and fluid

Yes, she's an Ontario girl and has some visible rust, but we have been assured by multiple mechanics that there are no structural issues.

Kasi sa totoo lang, surface-level na lang din madalas ang communication namin as spouses. But yes, our marriage was, or maybe still is, in a rough patch. And after years of trying to fix it in our own quiet, stubborn ways, I guess I can say we’re in a better place now.

Back to our ligawan days, he got me through coffee. Magka-work kami that time and every morning, diretso siya pantry to make me a cup. Walang palya.

This past week has been tiring for me plus the house was a mess dahil sa ongoing construction sa kitchen namin.  And as an OC, aftected ang sanity and mood ko pag di maayos ang paligid. So I told him last night na ayoko muna ng bisita. I was exhausted from work, and I just wanted this Saturday for myself para makapagpahinga, and maybe clean up later or tomorrow.

Pero pag-gising ko, around 10am, may message siya: ""Hi Mi, pakiluto nung manok sa fridge, dagdagan mo sinaing, dyan kami magla-lunch ni (officemate nya).""

Nabadtrip ako. I cooked rice but I didn't touch the chicken. There was already food for the kids anyway. I just stayed in our bedroom.

Come lunchtime, I went out. They were already eating. I sat at the dining table with the kids while he and his officemate were on the couch, their meals on the center table. And then, sa gitna ng init ng ulo ko at kalat sa bahay, he quietly stood up… and made me a cup of coffee.

It hit me right there.

After years of focusing on what was missing, I only jus rrealized it now. Na kahit hindi siya sweet, hindi ako nakikita, walang words of affirmation, no dates, hindi siya grand romantic gesture guy...he never stopped with this one thing. He still makes my coffee.
Every. Damn. Morning.
Every lunch.
Every merienda.
Whether we’re okay or not.

Hindi pala niya binibitawan 'yung paraan niya ng panliligaw. Regardless of whether we're fighting or not, consistent sya sa bagay na 'to.

Maybe love isn’t always loud. Sometimes, it’s just a cup of coffee quietly placed in front of you, without words, without conditions.

And maybe I'll start from there. Malamig o mainit ang kape, may dahilan pa rin para kumapit. Kahit madalas nakakapagod na, you just have to choose your person. ☕

1lbfqzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lbfqzj/ro_drifting_hearts/,[RO] Drifting Hearts,"Samantha had always felt like she was living someone else's life. At 29, married with two children, she should have been filled with joy and hope. But the years had buried her beneath a heavy silence, a sadness she never learned to shake. Inside, she was trapped—never truly living, only surviving. The weight of unspoken dreams and quiet disappointments pressed down on her every day. She moved through her life like a shadow, fading in the corners of her own home, her laughter forced and hollow.

One evening, when the silence grew too loud, Samantha closed her eyes and stepped away from the world, hoping to find peace in the dark.

But death did not bring peace. Instead, she found herself drifting — weightless, invisible, untethered. She could pass through walls, cross oceans, and float beneath starlit skies. The world was suddenly hers to roam, bound by nothing but the whisper of the wind. She was free at last—or so she thought.

Yet freedom was lonely.

She tried returning to the home she had left behind, hoping to find comfort in familiar walls. But the house was empty. Her husband, Paul, had moved on. Her children, Maddy and Steven, had grown, and the echoes of their laughter had long since faded from those rooms. Samantha floated through the vacant spaces, touching cold, forgotten surfaces, memories flickering like fragile ghosts of happier times—her son's first steps, her husband's gentle smile, the warmth of family dinners now gone.

Unable to stay, she drifted again, becoming a whisper in the night, sometimes playing tricks on strangers—a sudden chill, a faint voice whispering, ""Hello, guess who?"" She laughed softly as she disappeared again, never staying long enough to be caught. Her existence was a delicate balance between longing and flight.

One night, after drifting across oceans and cities, she found herself watching a man in a quiet house bathed in morning light. His name was Richard. He was older than her, with lines of sorrow etched deeply around his eyes. A widower, he spent his mornings brewing coffee just so—two sugars and milk—and playing his guitar softly as dawn broke. The melodies carried sadness and hope, grief and resilience, all woven together in the tender music he created.

Samantha watched him from the shadows, feeling an unexpected pull. There was something achingly familiar about his sadness, a reflection of the loneliness she had carried in life. It pulled at her like a thread, binding their souls in a way neither understood.

Under the silver glow of a full moon, the invisible barrier between them weakened. Richard felt a presence—a gentle brush against his skin, a sudden warmth in the chill air. When he looked up, he saw her—a shadow framed by moonlight, delicate and mesmerizing. His breath caught, heart pounding with disbelief and wonder.

Though he didn't know her name, he recognized the ache in her eyes.

Samantha's voice trembled as she whispered, ""Hello.""

Richard's voice was gentle but curious. ""Who are you? Why do you haunt me?""

She could not tell him the truth—not yet. Instead, she said softly, ""I don't want to scare you.""

""Then show me who you are,"" he said, and she revealed herself more clearly, her form flickering like a candle's flame—fragile, ethereal, beautiful.

Days turned to weeks, and weeks into months. Their connection deepened beyond words. Richard spoke to her as if she were a lost friend found at last, and Samantha felt emotions she had never known she could have. They shared quiet moments—her drifting close enough to feel his breath, his fingers strumming soft songs meant only for her.

One day, a simple touch bridged the impossible—a ghost and a man, connected by something neither understood but both treasured.

Fear gripped Samantha's heart. She could not bear to cause him pain, to make him long for what he could never truly have. So she vanished, leaving behind silence and the faint echo of her presence.

But her heart pulled her back—always back.

Samantha realized she was no longer a drifter. She was tethered to Richard by a bond stronger than death itself.

No matter how far she tried to go, the pull of love brought her home again.

Richard waited in patient hope, brewing coffee every morning just as she liked, leaving the porch light on through the night. He sang softly to the empty room, ""I'm here. Come back to me.""

One night, Richard took his guitar and poured his heart into a song he wrote for her. No words, just melody—slow, aching, and full of longing. The music floated through the air like a beacon, calling her home.

Drawn by the song, Samantha returned, stepping into the light of his small living room. Richard looked up, his eyes shining.

""There you are, my dear,"" he said softly.

She stepped forward, and shyly, tenderly, kissed him—a kiss small and silly, but true. When she pulled back, she whispered, ""I love you.""

Richard smiled, voice steady and sure. ""I love you too.""

And the silence that followed spoke louder than any words.

Together, they made a life beyond rules. His coffee in the morning. Her whispers in the night. A song played softly just for her. They didn't get forever. But they got this. And sometimes, that was enough.

Years passed, and their love never faded. One morning, Richard's soul left his body peacefully. At last, Samantha and Richard drifted together—two hearts, one soul, forever.",1,1749926274.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1lbfpm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sigils/comments/1lbfpm6/faq_what_is_a_sigil/,FAQ: What is a sigil?,"At its core, a **sigil** is a **charged symbol**—a mark, shape, or design that has been imbued with intention to produce an effect. But this definition only scratches the surface. To truly grasp what makes something a sigil, we must examine how the concept intersects with broader ideas like **seals, signs, enchantments, and even modern branding**. The key insight is that **sigils are not inherently magical or special on their own**—they become significant through interaction, belief, and ritual.

---

**The Authority of Marked Intent**

A **seal**, historically, was a mark of authenticity—pressed into wax to validate a document, denote ownership, or invoke protection. Kings, governments, and occultists all used seals as **physical confirmations of authority**. In this sense, a seal is a type of sigil—**a symbolic container of power**. The difference lies in cultural framing: a royal seal operates in the realm of law and politics, while a magician’s sigil operates in the realm of will and belief. Yet both function the same way: **they are representations of intent made manifest in the world**.

This overlap reveals something crucial: **what we now call a ""sigil"" was often just called a ""seal"" in the past**. The modern term ""sigil"" is a **retroactive label**, applied broadly to anything that fits the pattern of **a symbol charged with purpose**.

---

**The Line Between Meaning and Magic**

A **sign** is a direct indicator—a stop sign commands action, a heart symbol conveys love. A sigil, however, is **a sign that has been ritualized or personalized**. The difference is subtle but important:

- A **sign** communicates meaning **externally** (understood by many).

- A **sigil** communicates meaning **internally** (often private or subconscious).

Yet the boundary is fluid. A corporate logo (like Apple’s bitten apple) starts as a mere sign but, through cultural repetition and emotional association, **behaves like a sigil**—triggering subconscious responses. This shows that **anything can function as a sigil if it is treated as one**, regardless of its original purpose.

---

**The Act of Imbuing Power**

**Enchantment** is the process of infusing an object or symbol with intentional energy. A sigil is, in essence, **a compressed enchantment**. Where traditional enchantments might involve elaborate rituals, spoken spells, or material components, a sigil **distills the process into a single symbolic focal point**.

This is why chaos magicians argue that **even accidental marks can become sigils**—if someone assigns them meaning and activates them through focus or emotion. A coffee stain on a napkin is just a stain—until someone decides it represents their desire for creativity and ""charges"" it with belief. At that moment, **it becomes a sigil**.

---

**Beyond the Occult**

The principles of sigil-work appear in unexpected places:

- **Brand Logos** – Companies spend millions ensuring their logos evoke specific feelings, effectively turning them into **cultural sigils**.

- **Personal Rituals** – A lucky charm, a repeated mantra, or even a gym playlist can function as a sigil if it serves as a **trigger for a mental or emotional state**.

- **Digital Symbols** – Emojis, avatars, and even keyboard shortcuts act as **micro-sigils**, conveying complex ideas instantly.

This demonstrates that **sigil-like mechanisms are embedded in everyday life**—they are not exclusive to magic but are instead a fundamental part of **how humans interact with symbols**.

---

**Why the Term ""Sigil"" is Modern (And Why It Matters)**

Before the 20th century, most cultures did not have a single word for what we now call a ""sigil."" They had **seals, signatures, amulets, and sacred marks**, but these were context-specific. The broad, abstract idea of a ""sigil"" as **any symbol charged with intent** is a **modern reframing**, popularized by chaos magic and psychological occultism.

This reframing is useful because it allows us to **recognize sigils in places they were never named before**. A child’s doodle, a graffiti tag, or even a recurring dream image **can all be analyzed as sigils** if they hold personal or collective meaning.

---  

**What Makes Something a Sigil?**

A sigil is:

1. **A symbol** (any mark, shape, or design).

2. **Assigned intent** (given a specific purpose or meaning).

3. **Activated** (charged through focus, emotion, or ritual).

If these three criteria are met, **anything can be a sigil**—whether it was originally intended as one or not.

---

**Sigils Are Everywhere**

The history of sigils is really the history of **how humans project meaning onto the world**. Whether through ancient seals, religious icons, corporate branding, or personal rituals, **we are constantly creating and activating symbols to shape our reality**. Recognizing this pattern allows us to see **sigil-work not as an obscure practice, but as a fundamental human behavior**—one that blurs the lines between magic, psychology, and culture.

**Chapter 44. Interlude: The weight of money** 

  
Lenora Griffin leaned back in her chair and let out a sigh of relief. She was done with her work for the day and it was time to leave. She shared her office cabin in the Urban Vault bank with two other accountants like herself.

She wasn't fond of either of them. Both of them were supposed to be her seniors when she had joined yet instead of guiding her in the beginning, they'd let her stumble around with her job which drew in the ire of the branch manager towards her. In any sane minded institution, seniors would be held responsible for not providing any proper help to a newbie. Yet the manager had let her coworkers get off clean while directing all his disappointment towards her completely.

No one would've been surprised if Lenora said that she hated her workplace–especially the people she worked with. But the paycheck was good. For a divorcee in her late twenties, that's all that mattered to bring her any joy.

She shut all the audit files on her desk and put them back in the cabinets. After getting her satchel from her locker she headed for the ladies room. Looking into the mirror, she let down her hair that had been in a tight bun all day and splashed some water on her powdered face, washing away most of the day's fatigue.

That's when one of the stall doors behind her swung open. There was a creak of hinges, clacking of heels. A woman came and stood in front of the sink next to her.

Lenora tried not to peek at the lady. Because she had already glimpsed at the woman from the mirror. And she recognized her right away. Cynthia Radcliff.

She and her brother Rowland Radcliff had their accounts at the Urban Vault. Since Lenora didn't pretend to be friends with any of her coworkers, it meant that she was also out of the loop of the gossip around the bank. But she made up for it by overhearing and eavesdropping on conversations if something really interested her. She could then just piece together the rest of the stories from books and records if she didn't have anything better to do.

And the Radcliffs had been the hottest story around the bank recently. Rowland had drawn a business loan from the Urban Vault a few months ago. The amount had been quite a sum but the Radcliffs were old money and the collateral that Rowland provided was solid. So they'd let him have the steambolts.

The catch was, Rowland had booked it, allegedly with all the money. His sister Cynthia had cosigned the loan that he had drawn. And she didn't have enough funds to pay back.

So the Urban Vault seized all their assets because they charged a hellishly steep interest rate for the kind of business that Rowland had drawn the loan for. And now Cynthia was left with a debt that she had no way of paying back and no one to ask for help.

It was a pitiful story. And that was a very good reason for Lenora to not engage with it any further. Life was too short and miserable as it was. One couldn't just spend it trying to solve other people's problems.

So she kept her head down and avoided looking at Cynthia even for a second. She stepped towards the door and was about to walk out when the woman behind her made a noise.

A sniffle mixed with a whimper. It was the most helpless sound Lenora had ever heard anyone make. Like the sound of an animal with their foot snagged in a bear trap.

Lenora's hand was gripping the door latch tightly. All she had to do was turn the thing and get the hell out of there. Keep walking and not look back. Keep walking and not try to be a hero.

But instead she found herself looking down at her own hand on the latch. Her knuckles were turning white. Her heart was feeling heavy.

*Get out,* she told herself. *Just get out. You know you can't help that woman. Some people are just beyond helping. Get out.*

With a reluctant twist of her hand, she started to open the door. Then Cynthia made that sound again.

The helpless, pitiful whimper of someone who was trying their hardest to not cry. That's when Lenora found all the strength leaving her body. Her hand let go of the latch almost on its own. And she heaved a sigh.

With an equal amount of reluctance and relief, she turned to the woman and said, “You are Cynthia Radcliffe, aren't you? Are you…are you okay?”

\_\_

No. No, she wasn't. But she couldn't deny the gratitude that she felt towards Lenora for asking her that question.

Like most people in Cynthia's state of mind, she didn't need much of an invitation for talking about what she was going through. Lenora took her down to the Vault cafeteria for a cup of coffee while they talked.

She was watching Cynthia as they made their way down the beige walled hallways. The woman wore a tailored vest over a high collared blouse and a long flowing skirt. She ordered a black tea at the cafeteria and remained surprisingly composed throughout the conversation. Lenora was a bit surprised seeing the woman that calm after having seen the state in which she had been in the ladies room.

“They have assumed my brother is dead.” Cynthia shrugged with a resigned look. “And since I said that I don't have any funds available to pay back the debt, they have started taking away everything I had. Rowland had provided our family mansion as collateral. And they sent me an eviction notice this morning. My father had left us both fifty acres of land each and they are taking it away as well. They've frozen his bank account. And maybe they are going to do the same for me.” She paused and looked at the distant wall. “I don't even know what I'm going to do anymore.”

“What about…friends or family?” Lenora asked.

“I have an aunt but when I told her about my situation she kicked me out,” Cynthia said. “She said I made a stupid mistake by cosigning my brother's loan. And now I'll have to face the consequences.”

Lenora grimaced. “I'm really sorry. She sounds awful.”

Cynthia shrugged again. “I have two friends who are rich and they are offering to pay everything but then I'll be indebted to them, *with* interest. If I'm going to be indebted one way or another. Then why not let the banks just take away everything I have? My ‘friends’ seem to want to do the same thing.” She scoffed and took a sip of her drink. “My father's friends didn't even see me in person. Their secretaries and butlers sent me off without even letting me speak my piece.”

Lenora grimaced again. “Those…don't sound like friends at all.”

“I think I deserve it.” Cynthia gave a bitter laugh. “Aunty was right. I was dumb enough to get in this trouble because I trusted my brother. And now I'll just have to deal with the consequences.”

“No.” Lenora leaned ahead. “What you did might've been stupid and a ‘wrong move’ but you don't deserve it. No one deserves to have their homes and money taken away like this.”

“I don't think it matters much either way,” Cynthia said. “I'm going to be homeless. Maybe I should…get a job as a housemaid or something.” She shrugged.

“No no, don't say that!” Lenora leaned further. “Don't jump to that decision just yet.”

“Why not? And why do you feel so bad for me?” Cynthia scoffed again. “It's funny because the people I trusted have all turned their backs on me and the only person showing any kind of understanding is a bank clerk.”

“I'm an accountant,” Lenora said. “And no, none of what has happened to you is funny.” She sighed and rubbed her forehead. “Some of it really doesn't make much sense. The bank could've tried restructuring your loan. But they are moving over to a seizure right away.”

“I wondered if I could sue them but a lawsuit will drain whatever I have left in me.” Cynthia shook her head. “I'm talking about both money and life.”

“You said the bank has assumed your brother is dead. How did they come to that conclusion?” Lenora asked.

“The internal police looked around for him for five days. Since they found nothing, that's the conclusion they made. That's all the bank needed to start taking everything away from me,” Cynthia said.

“But if your brother returns, in case he isn't dead, you can make him pay,” Lenora said.

“*If* my brother returns,” Cynthia said. “That's a big ‘if’. I know Rowland. If he wanted to really disappear. He would do it in a way that no one would be able to find him.”

“He went missing five days ago,” Lenora said. “There are people with talents very well suited to finding people in such a short time.”

“And they charge a lot,” Cynthia said, rolling her eyes.

Lenora grinned a little. “I might know someone who might help you out for well…a bit cheaper.”

Undead Unluck had its ups and downs, and the ending had more missed potential than I would've hoped. But my god, the fight against UMA Language is so clever and well done that it became my favorite arc almost instantly. However, while it's certainly gotten some acclaim from fans and casual readers (the later chapters of this arc are some of the most upvoted / discussed UU chapters on the UU and general manga subreddits), the lack of popular attention when compared to similar fights like Hakari vs. Kashimo in JJK or Iron Might vs. AFO is downright criminal (I say these fights are similar because they are hype fights between ""side characters"" during an important pre or in endgame part of the story). In this post (likely essay by the time I'm done), I'm going to analyze the events of the Language fights and how it links to the overall themes of the story, while showing why those parts are enjoyable and well-executed. Strap in, cuz this is gonna be a long one, and I'll assume y'all read this with a prior understanding of the setting of UU and how it works. 

  
Let's start with some background. We are first introduced to the concept of UMA Language all the way back in Chapter 9 of the manga, as one of the six quests the Union are given. It is a neutralization quest (kill, not capture), has a participant count of 1, and the reward is the unification of all world languages. Seeing as it is one of six quests, we readers lump it in with the others and think nothing special of it, cuz we're still trying to learn about the world, but in retrospect this is an AoT level Chekov's Gun. whether this was intended when Tozuka made this chapter is unknown, but for Tozuka to be able to link what seems like a throw away UMA to be a critical antagonist almost 200 chapters later is incredible.

Language is referenced again when the quests are being cleared in chapter 19, and we find out that the scientist character Nico Vorgeil, 8th seat of the union (aka lowest rank before Fuuko and Andy join) was the one to kill them. Immediately, we are lulled into a false sense of security.

""That UMA must not have been that tough, the low ranking scientist took them out on his own""

This is an excellent misdirection, because it makes you believe that Nico and Language are both relatively weak characters, when the opposite is true. This scene also obfuscates the existence of Master Rules by having the quest reward be the unification of all world languages. We are shown that killing and adding UMA's changes the world in the chapter, but because killing Language unifies world languages as a reward, we are retroactively tricked into thinking that Language isn't a Master Rule once the concept of MR's is revealed in Chapter 177. Again, because this occurs early on we can't be sure if this was planned, but the fact that it fits perfectly with later information makes me think it was at least an idea in Tozuka's head, if not his explicit plan

UMA Language is finally encountered in person in Chapters 181 and 182, when Fuuko confronts the Superior Rules inside their control room within the sun (Side note if you only read the first few chapters of UU and then you read that sentence you would be so confused lol). We are not given the names of any UMA there except Sick, and some of the UMA don't even speak (like Language) but the community started trying to guess what they were anyways. Some like Beast and War were easy, while some like Death and Justice could've been a few of the UMA at the table (unrelated, love the parallel between he SR and the Union, down to the table and rankings). Language was in the former category, as she was reading a book during the encounter and her headpiece looked like the Tower of Babel. So while there was still room for doubt, the 8th seat was assumed to be Language early on.

This presented a large piece of intrigue for us readers, if not the largest then certainly the ""longest"": If the Loop 101 union couldn't even beat Sick in something like a 15 v 1, how did Nico beat Language in a 1v1 in loop 100? At this point, we know that Nico had unforgettable back then, but he doesn't now. We also know from volume extras that Nico was low ranked not because of his capabilities, but because he asked Juiz to let him spend his time in the lab and only send him on missions when absolutely necessary. At this point, we are led to believe that Juiz sent Nico to fight language 1v1, so if she's stronger than Sick and the seat nine UMA (we don't know it's Beast at this point) Nico must have some way to counter her, either with his negation or his science (this will be important later).

Still, some people argued that since Seat 8 is stronger than Sick, and Language was beaten by Nico in a 1v1 last loop, that it must not be UMA Language. This doubt was dispelled in Chapter 187 when we get confirmation via the ques that Seat 8 is UMA Language. But this throws fuel on the fire of intrigue, as Fuuko basically states that Juiz was only able to hold off the SR with Unjustice. So now the question of how Nico could beat her is burning even brighter in mind.

The Language Arc finally starts at the end of Chapter 199, after the Beast fight has ended, when Language launches a surprise attack on the Union with the goal of killing ""**the negator with an advanced understanding of souls**"" Ichico Nemuri, a fellow Union scientist, former wife of Nico in loop 100, and former mother of Mico in loop 100 (fun fact: if you remove the ""co"" from their names, you have Ni, Ichi, and Mi, or 1,2,3 in Japanese! So you can say that the family of scientists is named after a math equation, because 1 + 2 = 3. Just another example of Tozuka's clever naming / writing in general). She is introduced reading while sitting on the unconscious form of one of the side cast lab members (helmet guy; although he does have a name I am not recalling it currently), right in front of Nico and Ichico, (**who Nico is standing in front of to protect)** setting the stage for the neutralization of UMA Language and filling us with a sense of unease at the unknowns of her strength

Language also blocks the rest of the Union's (and large parts of the globe's) ability to use language, so that Fuuko and the Beast team can't tell the rest of the Union about the Soul rule. This is where my first bit of praise comes in for Tozuka's writing in this arc, because the villains are shown to be competent and capable of planning. Having Fuuko and Soul explain their plans simultaneously, even going so far as to ""finish each other's sentences"" between two panels does a good job of establishing that both sides did not came to play, and are taking this seriously and logically, making full force of their abilities and not holding back. This is something that other series can sometimes struggle with, so to see Tozuka have a competent, rational villain / villain group is a sign of his skills

Chapter 200 begins with a flashback to loop 100, showing the immediate aftermath of the offscreen neutralization of Language by Nico. Now full disclosure, I am a big fan of Nico, especially when he's unforgettable, because his lines are hard and his aura is harder, and it's on full display here. As Language is fading away post defeat, Nico is apologizing for beating her so bad, while having some coffee. This action becomes even more disrespectful once we know that he had to waste a word to summon it, and just makes him look so goddamn cool.

But more importantly, we get explicit confirmation from UMA language that up until now, no negator other than Unjustice had beaten her. Nico is the second negator to ever defeat her, and Juiz must've known he was capable. This is a nice little bit of retroactive characterization for Loop 100 Juiz, as she needed to rely on others even more after Victor was sealed., and considering Loop 100 may have been the only time Nico manifested his ability (a personal theory of mine, assuming that Ichico was only encountered in Loop 100), she had to have faith in his strength without seeing it. But more importantly, how would Nico's ability make him such a hard counter for Language (to the point that she is now obsessed with beating him in Loop 101, in an 8th seat versus 8th seat rematch)

So Language is talking about how she never *forgot* her humiliation and is excited for their rematch. Except Nico doesn't have Unforgettable, which Language notices almost immediately and has a mini freak out, which is nice because the UMA are at their best when they're acting kind of quirky and weird (hence why Soul was a fan favorite). She quickly realizes his tragedy hasn't happened, and tried to reason what it will be so she can manifest it.

Now up to this point in Loop 101, Nico and Ichico have been ""rivals"" more than they've been love interests. They butt heads, tease each other (the unmarriable comment from Nico in 145 was hilarious), but there is genuine worry and appreciation for each other under the surface (Nico crying tears of joy when Fuuko extracts her soul so she can sleep when he doesn't know she's watching is the best example of this). So when Language asks what his tragedy will be, Nico makes the same mistake as Orpheus, and he looks slightly back towards Ichico, which Language notices and she immediately impales Ichico. In her mind this is great, she did what Soul asked her to do and she gets her rematch, win-win!

Except Ichico is ""**the negator with an advanced understanding of souls**"" and manages to start ""astral projecting"" (read: soul projection) before she goes unconscious. We also get a nice bit where Language and Ichico talk where Language tells her to die so Nico can be useful since she's not, and Ichico tells her that she's more than a damsel who dies for someone's character development (love Tozuka poking fun at tropes here), but importantly, **Ichico acknowledges that manifesting Unforgettable would be against Fuuko's wishes, because she wants everyone to be as happy as they can be**. So Ichico says she is ""going to live like you've never seen"". 

It's worth noting that at this point, Nico cannot see or hear Ichico, and only knows she isn't dead because Language talks to her. **This is because Nico doesn't believe in souls at this point**, as he is a man of science to the point of hard-headedness. Ichico tries to tell him to slow down and not rush into things, but Nico can't hear her so her attempts are fruitless. But his internal monologue explains his quickness to start the battle: Ichico's body isn't stabilized, and if he doesn't beat Language in time her body could die (Technically since UMA Ghost is around, Ichico would be fine, but Nico doesn't believe in that either so his behavior is consistent). This is another example of Nico really caring for Ichico, and starts the ball rolling on what's to come

So the quest begins, with Nico and Ichico fighting Language **despite having one less negator than needed.** The theory crafting of who the third member would be intensifies here, with the most common pick being Tella (due to his ability interactions with Language and to give him some characterization cuz he's a surprisingly popular character in polls)

Chapter 201 finally introduces the gimmick of Language: **Deadly Shiritori**. One side says a word, and that word will manifest into reality for you to use to fight. The other side will then manifest another word that starts with the same letter as the ending letter of the previous word, and you will clash for a period of time before the round is over, and the side that went second will now **add a new language** and go first. The catch? The languages they add can be any of the confirmed languages in the 4.6 billion year loop, which is about **7,000 languages total**.

This game will continue with both sides going back and forth until one of three conditions is met: A word is repeated, you don't say a word in time (such as you are killed or knocked unconscious), or in this specific version, **say a word that end in the Japanese syllable ""N"" when translated**. Lan starts by summoning a meteor (RyuseI like Fuuko uses, except she makes it **iron** to be more dangerous. Nico responds with summoning Aegis (Iijisu), one of the three sacred spirit artifacts. But the version he summons is a little wobbly because **he couldn't imagine it properly**, only having Fuuko's description to go off of, so while it successfully breaks the meteor apart, the shield breaks as well and now it cannot be used again (repeat word)

The rest of the chapters proceed in this manner: The next moves are: Nico adds English and does ""aegiS - Science"", Language responds with ""sciencE - Eruption (Funka), and Nico and Ichico work together to survive the magma / heat using their psycho pods (Nico also credits Ichico's control as better than his, a nice little detail). Language adds the Ainu language and goes ""FunKA - KAmuyhum"" to summon lightning, and Nico responds with ""KamuyhuM - Maw (wind)"" to push the iron dust particles left from the destroyed meteor towards her lightning to cause a dust explosion, making use of his prior blunder with Aegis to deliver a counterattack. Two nice things about this sequence: it shows the intelligence of the characters involved, and Tozuka includes the words used in their battle for us to follow along with (although sometimes we had to look up how certain chains worked, which I will include going forward to make following the game easier)

So 202 starts with Nico (and Ichico) realizing that the best strategy is to combo going second into going first, further demonstrating their intelligence in a way that we will find believable. But Nico has another question for Language about the rules in 202: If she said Eruption that ends in ""N"", why didn't she lose? Language reclarifies that it's only if the word ends in the **Japanese syllable ""N"" when translated**, and remarks that it'll get easier and easier to avoid those words as more languages get added, to the point where you could theoretically play forever. Nico and Ichico realize the true depth of the danger they're in at this point: Because of her abilities, she will **never** **be forced to** **repeat a word or end it in Japanese ""N"", so beating her via those rules is impossible**.

Nico does some further analysis in his head, showing his smarts and reevaluating the stakes, but we now finally understand how he could have beat Language in Loop 100 (he can remember every word said, and based on her name and potential advice from Juiz he probably looked up all 7,000 languages before the fight, evening the odds). But on the flip side, the ""manifestation"" flags for him in this fight have started to raise (similar to death flags but for him getting his ability). Around this time we get a quick cut to the Fuuko group to see them get attacked by the juniors of ""UMA War"", to hopefully kill them but at least slow them from getting back to HQ. This is another instance of Tozuka establishing the SR as competent under the command of Soul

The fight continues. Nico goes ""MaW - Wall"" to buy time, Language goes ""WalL - Lance of Longinus"" and breaks his wall . Here we see the start of some characterization for Language (she loves to use weapons from books and likes romanticism over logic), and she explains that she was able to break through his wall because she imagined a mythical lance, which she relates to the concept of **Kotodama** \- **the Soul of Words.** She adds Chinese, and summons a dragon"" Lance of LonginuS - Shen Long). Ichico is surprised that even unreal things are allowed, and Language explains that they are obviously allowed, you just have to have a vivid imagination that ""intellectual types"" like them struggle with. This is similar to something we have seen previously with Andy and Victor, where victor doesn't believe in souls while Andy does, so Andy can use his soul powers

Facing a dragon, Nico and Ichico need something to send against that monster, and Ichico uses **""RyU - Umibozu""**, summoning a Japanese yokai monster. But she didn't actually know too much about it, so it's basically just a cuddly mascot that gets vaporized instantly to buy them time to run (and have some comedy). But after the Umibozu is destroyed, **Ichico experiences pain**. Nico thinks he hears something, and asks Language if Ichico is ok to no response, and since he can't ask Ichico, he starts to theorize. He puts together the information he has, and realizes that this battle was different than the previous ones because the battle between the dragon and the umibozu was a battle between things that aren't real. He also realizes that Ichico can't interact with things physically, so something unknown must be causing her pain, and that reason is their key to beating language. 

This is when our knowledge as readers extends past him, because we know what was learned about souls from the Beast fight, and can theorize that Language was being literal when she referenced **Kotodama** \- **the Soul of Words**. If the thing summoned is imaginary, maybe it has parts of the summoner's soul in them. But then the question becomes why doesn't Nico know this, if he's smarter than us as demonstrated with stuff like the dust explosion? But the answer is obvious, and has been present with him since loop 101 began: **Nico still doesn't believe in souls at this point**, and he can't win until he does.

He is starting to perceive Ichico better though, as he is able to hear her tell him to let her handle thinking of a word that's ""capable of beating a dragon"", and she reaches out to Fuuko mentally to tell her the plan, keeping it hidden from us at first. There is a hint to the identity, as Fuuko says ""I doubt that person will come"", and we begin to realize something. Umibozu ends in U, so you could chain it to the name of **any negator in the world**, and we still need a third negator for the quest to be successful. So Ichico had the idea to summon a negator, but one of the themes of the manga is that **""negators can't do anything on their own"",** so most negators wouldn't be able to beat a dragon on their own right?

Well, there is one, and y'all probably know who I'm talking about already: from Chapter 137 ""Something **far** worse than a meteorite""; from Chapter 161: **""The pinnacle of martial arts!! The undefeated of the East, West, South, North - and dare I say, all of creation!!""**

**The negator ""UNFADE"", FENG KOWLOON!!!**

Here's a nice little mid analysis break to give y'all a chance to digest what I've said before going into the next parts. If you read this, let me know who your favorite UU character is (if you have one) and why, or do the same for your least favorite UU character. Now let's get into the thick of it

This is when the Language arc went from great to a contender for top arc in the manga for me, because not only is Feng just like Nico (funny, aura, strong, favorite character of mine, etc), his inclusion in the arc came out of nowhere. I'm not exaggerating when I say I didn't see a single person think that Feng would be the third person to fight language in the theory crafting prior to the arc. (Nico and Ichico were givens, third was something like Tella). But now he's here, and this trio is surprisingly funny, so this is another example of the creativity Tozuka has when it comes to character interactions and arc progressions

So 202 ends with Feng being summoned (in the middle of sleep mind you) to the union HQ, and he wakes up in 203 to find a dragon in front him (that he already struck in his sleep lol). We have brief funny scene of Nico and Ichico celebrating Feng being here and praising Ichico's idea to summon him while Feng sits there, groggy and unamused with his hair down. The dragon prepares to attack, and Nico and Ichico tell him to take it down and that they'll explain what's going on after

Except Feng just taps soul Ichico on the cheek with his finger, and apparently absorbs her memories of what's going on as he remarks about the Shiritori game without being told. In any other manga, this would be anything from a glaring inconsistency to an asspull from the author (Ah yes, my memory absorption technique, I haven't used this since the Heian era), but here it makes sense. Feng had remarked on the concept of souls in cryptic ways in Loop 100 (in the union prison, he says he's ""gotten an hang of this soul thing after ghost is added) and Loop 101 he remarks that Fuuko also has ""a firm grasp on her soul"", and we know how fast of a learner he is, so it's consistent story wise for Feng to have already developed soul techniques on his own, cuz he's just *That Guy* (complementary)

So as Feng is tying his hair back and getting ready to fight, Language remarks that against a dragon, ""a lone negator doesn't stand a... chance?"" as she is immediately interrupted mid-speech by Feng showing that the dragon is the one that didn't have a chance. He quickly strikes the head of the dragon into the ceiling, and after landing on its body he notices a scale on the dragon that's different from the others. He then proceeds to strike the dragon multiple times at a speed to fast to track, before culminating in a final strike on the strange scale, destroying the dragon. He then remarks that Language has an ""excellent superpower"", and that it will ""make for good training"" while Language's nose begins to bleed (more confirmation of Nico's and our theory)

He lands and is immediately approached by Ichico and Nico (who also throws himself around him like a rescued princess) so they can praise him. Nico and Ichico comment on Feng being given a seat in the union, and start talking about needing Feng's help and what planning they do. But Feng doesn't care about any of that, as he remarks to ""Cig Sucker"" (his name for Nico lol) that ""If I continue to string together words, an endless supply of powerful foes will come forth!!"" And there it is, Nico and Ichico (and Language) comment on their mistake (that we saw coming): **They forgot to account for his bloodlust and desire to grow stronger, that makes him a bad teammate here**, and their reactions are hilarious. It's refreshing to see that Tozuka can still interweave character comedy into tense situations like this and not have it feel forced (every character here is acting consistent with earlier occurrences after all)

But going back to Language claiming they made a mistake, it turns out that had an additional meaning than just the one we thought about Feng's quality as a teammate. After Feng taunts her to ""give him her best shot"" (bad move Feng), she decides to oblige him. She uses ""UnfadE - Evolution"" to upgrade from her Phase 2 form to her Phase 3 form, gaining not only the words and imaginations of the people who's language she was blocking, but also adding a new rule to the game, doubling the amount of words said per round (so now each team will say two words per turn, with the other rules still applying)

This moment is underappreciated genius, a beautiful blending of character design, story consistency, character realism, and rising tension and raising stakes. She grows taller in her Phase 3 form, but the broken Tower of Babel on her head reforms to an undamaged version, nice little design choice. It also makes sense that she only used it now, as no other word would have allowed her to start with E before this (making ""Unfade"" a blunder), which means she wasn't ""holding back"" her Phase 3 form to toy with them like Beast was, and the tension and stakes are raised even further with her next turn:

**""I will add Latin. EvolutioniS - SoL, SoL - Luna""**

That's right, once she gets her powerup, she immediately summons effigies of the two endgame bosses of the series. No playing around, no buildup, just straight for the *nuclear* option. This is so refreshing to see a villain who takes their fight seriously, and is giving it their all throughout. And though she remarks that her imagination was still too limited to perfectly replicate them, they would still be enough to kill the quest team

Feng doesn't care though, and gets ready to go charge in until Nico interrupts him to demand that he wait so they can plan and win. But Feng makes the same point as Language: **""If you want to win, sacrifice the woman and manifest your ability""** Feng claims that he would be sacrificing just one person instead of losing several, so why not do it unless she's just that important to him. He then says that he won't be lectured by someone like that and moves to leave, with Language remarking that ""words won't work on someone like Feng"", but Nico stops him again and gets up in his face and delivers a scathing retort, saying that the old Nico may've done that because he was an egotistical scientist and a slave to logic, but since he's met Fuuko and the others he's changed and come to realize **the limits of going it alone**, and remarks that surely Feng knows it too. It is at this point that Nico's eyes display the ""soul glow"" we've seen from characters that can perceive and use souls, as he is starting his process of accepting it

Feng begrudgingly asks Nico what letter he'll end with, signaling he will cooperate for now, and they chain together ""LunA - Absolute Nulla (absolute zero, or 0 kelvin) and  ""(Zettai ReiDO) - TO Fuu dandoukyaku (Eastern Winds Ballistic Kick)"". Nico freezes Sol so Feng can get close, and Feng whacks 'em per Ichico's explanation for the audience. Nice end to the chapter, and we get a nice moment for Feng as he explains that he came up with that technique on the spot and used the power of the game to make it a real technique, further demonstrating his absurd Battle IQ and ability to learn

204 begins in the aftermath of that attack, with Nico thinking the attack is working while Feng remarks that it isn't due to the sturdiness of their foes. Sol is still thawing so he can't attack, but Luna launches a soul blast at Feng sending him flying into a wall and scorching part of his body, only surviving because he used his soul to guard himself at the last second. Language immediately remarks on his abilities and acknowledges she has to kill him too before he can gain a full grasp on souls, made funnier by the fact that she says this as Feng immediately validates her conclusion by realizing **he can detach parts of his soul and fire them as a weapon** (yet another moment of Feng being HIM).

Feng doesn't get a chance to try it though, as the round's ""rally"" has ended and they cannot fight until the next set of words are said, but Nico says what we're all thinking: ""what words could possibly get them to the next turn?"" against the two strongest enemies, with a teammate who's about to rush in with zero plan. Feng does has plan though, ""To Fuu dandoukyaKU - KUsuri (medicine)"", to use the wonder drug that Shen won in the martial arts tournament arc (nice little callback). Feng is confident that his new understanding of souls will be enough to win the fight if he's back at full power, so he doesn't even care what the second word is because of his ""assured victory""

As he walks away to start the ""rally"", Ichico chimes in (and we get to see Feng call her ""Hidey Eyes"", his nicknames are great) to tell him his plan will fail, explaining that her more complete understanding of souls (from the near death state she is currently in) better informs her that **Luna can't be beaten alone**, **and that the three will need to work together to beat her**. Feng remarks that they still don't have a plan then, as Nico can't use souls to the level they can.

So Ichico gives us her plan: Help Nico understand souls, and manifest Unforgettable at the same time using their lives (deaths). She correctly deduces that Unforgettable can function as an excellent learning ability, so her plan is to use their first word to help Feng with his soul-based technique to protect Nico, while the second word gives him **every piece of knowledge they can** (wonder what could do that?). Nico and Feng initially object, with Nico's refusal being much more emotionally charged. He doesn't want them to risk their lives on a plan that may not work, especially one that will require their deaths.

But Ichico disagrees, noting that he could use Shiritori to bring them back to life, which doesn't convince Nico but does convince Feng, who (rightfully) realizes that he can learn more from dying and come back even stronger. He tells Nico to do it, and begins planning words with Ichico while Nico keeps processing and trying to interrupt them, to stop them from dying on a plan he doesn't, he *can't* believe in. But as he desperately attempts to convince them to reconsider, eyes fully lit by the ""soul glow"", the full form of Ichico comes over to hug him goodbye and explain the ""proof"" she has that her plan will work, as Nico keeps pleading and starts to cry:

""...It's no secret that I used to only care about science, but you're the first **person** who has ever won over my heart""

And now we see why Ichico changed her mind on wanting to die for Nico. It's not just because he can revive them later, it's because she *knows* he will, as she finally comes to terms with their love for each other and the faith in each other that allows for. Feng uses his new technique, ""To Fuu dandoukyaKU - KU on Shinkon-ha (Eternal True Soul Wave, looks just like a Kamehameha)"", and Ichico finally reveals her trump card: ""Ku on Shinkon-hA - Apocalypse"", summoning the big bad book himself for Nico to use. Language responds with ""ApocalypsE - Excalibur (Ekusukariba)"" and ""EkusukariBA - BArumanku (Balmung), further demonstrating her love of literature, and the four entities clash, leaving the slightly damaged forms of Sol and Luna as the only trace of Ichico and Feng. Language remarks that she has finally met the ""real Unforgettable"" and that it was worth the 4.6 billion year wait. And then, as Nico clutches Apocalypse, we get my favorite moment of the chapter, Nico's manifestation

Now I have to talk about the parallels between his big fight here and his big fight in Loop 100, because they are critical. Both started in the Union's basement lab, which in Loop 100 was his safe haven. It had all the memories of Ichico he used to stay sane, and as such represented his inability to move on from her death as we see when he's talking to Mico before he dies. He was ""stuck"" in the lowest level of the Union base because he himself was at his lowest point, full of random cluttered experiments (just like his mind was full of random information, another analogy) and Andy had to destroy his lab in order to ""free"" him from the shackles of his past attachments. And now, in loop 101, he doesn't even have that, as the lab now houses the same memory of his wife's death he was forced to remember in Loop 100

And yet, as the scene in loop 101 switches to show Nico, we don't see the sunken, sullen face we did during his Loop 100 reveal. We don't hear the anguished words of a man so racked with grief he has given up on the world and desires nothing more than seeing his wife again. Instead, even as Apocalypse attempts to ""crush"" Nico with the memories within him, Nico gives one of my favorite monologues in the series, with sweat and tears running down his face and the biggest smile we've seen from him (and eyebags, love that he immediately gets them back)

He admonishes Ichico for confessing to him when she promised that she would never utter those words. That he thought they would wait to say it until everything was over. And then, on the classic Undead Unluck negation ability reveal panel, he says this:

""I couldn't *forget* even if you told me to. Those words. Those memories. I've engrained them into my soul!!""

Now Undead Unluck has a lot of good negation reveal panels, like Tatiana, Billy, L100 Ragnarok Yusai, and L101 Ragnarok Mui. But this one may just be the best, because of how it compares to his monologue during his Loop 100 reveal

""I want to see her again, once more, before this feeling inside me that's barely hanging on becomes something I forget""

The difference is immediately clear. Loop 100 Nico lives in fear of his ability, a curse that will slowly eat away at everything he used to care about, an inescapable rule of the universe (barring killing God). The loss of his wife and his ability have left him broken and wallowing in the past, and all he can hope for is to talk to his wife once more before the world ends, to give him one last happy memory of his wife. **His reveal is depressing, because Loop 100 is a tragic story**

Loop 101 Nico, on the other hand, has embraced his ability. He treats it not as a curse, but as a blessing, allowing him to remember his wife forever. He not only appreciates the memories he made with Ichico rather than fear them, but he has full faith that he will see his wife and they'll live happily ever after, all in the face of the biggest threat of his life. He has not given up this time, and he gazes forward into the future despite the fact that he faces harder odds than before (beating Andy), because he knows he's gonna pull off a **perfect victory**. Unlike Loop 100, **his reveal is full of hope and conviction, because Loop 101 is supposed to be the perfect story that Loop 100 could have been**.

As such, the Unforgettable reveal here is a perfect representation of so many of the manga's themes so far: fighting on in the face of pain and adversity, the dual nature of remembering those who have fallen, the purpose of strength and how it relates to those you love and care about, correcting past mistakes for the ""perfect ending"", and of course living by your own rules and denying the fate that others would have you live (Oh and also love triangles, as the chapter ends with Language claiming to have fallen in love with Nico all over again, and Nico telling her he's already taken)

1lbfn99,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lbfn99/i_found_myself_in_a_strange_place_part_1/,I found myself in a strange place. [Part 1],"I woke in an instant, my brain restarting before my eyes and ears. I sat up and felt an intense pain as my forehead collided with something metal. I lay in a coffin shaped object packed with a hard foam around my legs not allowing me enough room to kick free. The claustrophobic effect made it hard to breathe. Panic began to set in as I screamed out the last air of my lungs into the void. 

The low hum of machinery echoed in my ears, and I felt myself moving as if on an elevator. My screams fell to silence over the hum, and it slowly dug into my skull eating at my brain. When at last I felt as though I was going to break into a mind ending insanity. The elevator jolted to a stop making my face smack hard against the metal. 

A whirring of machinery sounded, and latches began to unclick one by one, dozens of them as a small sliver of light began to cut its way through the darkness. The sight blinded my eyes; my panic began to emerge once more, but I quelled it under my desperation to escape. My hands and knees began to press hard against the lid of my prison. With an audible pop the lid flew off to the side a dusty grimy light flooded in to greet me. I scrambled out of the coffin and collapsed to the ground. My legs felt weak as though I hadn't used them in a long time. I lay there rubbing the feeling back into them as I gazed around where I was. 

It was a dingy brown room. A scent of smoke and grease lingered in the air with an acrid taste of metal. No windows grace the walls of my new prison but a dim orange light in every corner of the room gave life to the area. A single door with blocky letters on it was the only source of attention. ""Factorium."" It read. I got to my feet slowly using a rusted-out handrail that surrounded the, when I noticed something else that was odd. On the back of my left palm was the number 42. It stood out bold and black as if tattooed. 

I climbed up the coffin noticing the tight confines of my precious prison. It was shaped perfectly for my body as if formed around me like liquid. As I took my first real step away. A loud clang filled my ears, and I turned in time to watch the coffin shaped elevator descend into the floor. A rusty metal door slid on top of it cutting me off. I jumped at it, my only means of escape disappearing into the perfectly seamless floor. 

With little resolution I turned my back on the past and headed towards the only door. Angry machinery greeted me with a cloud of smoke. Dozens of machines whirred and buzzed as their mechanical arms rotated up and down. Gears mashed together giving me sensory overload. This was like nothing I had seen before. The room was a smoky mess, it made my head feel dizzy and I couldn’t breathe properly. I dropped to one knee, keeping below the haze and my mind cleared allowing me to calm myself.

When it hit me, who was I? How did I come to be here? Where was I? Why couldn't I remember anything about my past? 

Before my thoughts could hold me down. A large buzzer erupted beside my head setting off a red flashing light. I had no choice but to escape the ear-splitting hammer of the horns bugle; I moved through the machinery towards the opposite side of Factorium. 

Through the maze of machinery, I found another brown dingy doorway. Lit up by the flashing red lights. A blocky frame held the word “Break Room”. I made my way through the door into an utterly unexpected room that regarded an old lunchroom at a dingy factory from long past. A coffee pot covered in dust and misuse sat on the counter looking dejected and alone. An old couch stood vigil with its dyed brown fabric covered with layers of dirt and grease as if it had been used more than anything. A single table and chair made of solid enough looking metal legs and vinyl top sat in one corner next to an odd-looking vending machine that dominated the center of the room. Next to it on the wall beside the entrance was a futuristic looking television screen, oddly out of place and warranted further inspection. It was the only thing not covered in dust as it sat silent but drawing the eye none the less. A small hole beneath it made me pause before I continued on.

Another doorway labeled “Bunks” sat next to a dirty countertop with an ancient looking rag and bucket resting on top. I tried the handle, but the door was locked firmly. I bumped my hip into it hoping to dislodge it, but it stayed firm as if a barrier between myself and its secrets. 

I glanced around the room and sat heavily on the couch. A cloud of dust billowed around me making me cough as I waved it away. A triumphant bugle played from somewhere in the room. The monitor by the door lit up with a rainbow of colours, distinctly contrasting the odd environment I had gotten myself trapped in. 

The bugle played loudly again as if declaring a great event and I made my way over to stand in front of it. With a blinding beam, a blast of light shot out at me as if it was scanning me. 

""Congratulations! Number 42!"" It wrote across the screen in bright letters. 

""You have personally been selected to the great honour of maintaining Factorium, a great place to work if you don't mind me saying. Ha ha."" It even wrote in the ha ha I noticed, and I just stood their overwhelmed. 

""I'm sure as you have already noticed, this facility is provided with top-of-the-line accommodations but to unlock its full potential you will have the honour of collecting tokens! As a show of kindness, I will now donate you one free token to use at your discretion. Congratulations! You have earned one token."" 

A small rattling noise like a vending machine dispensing a coin rattled and a bright yellow poker chip appeared at the bottom of the monitor through a coin slot. 

""Thank you."" I said shakily. 

""No thanks needed number 42. You may notice to use a lot of Factorium’s areas and perks you require tokens. For example, the bunks area is only unlocked after you insert five tokens into the slot next to it. The vending machine supplies all essentials for hygiene and nutrition. We offer a variety of delicious options to eat and drink."" 

The screen fluttered and a list of tasks flooded the screen. 

1. Maintain all the pumps. Each bucket of sludge removed from the gears and deposited into the chute will receive one token. You need to pull the handle to pause the machine for fifteen seconds. 

2. Clean the headquarters. Too much dust is a bad thing. You will receive one token upon completion. 

3. Unblock the grate, that supplies the liquid into the pipes. You will receive two tokens. 

""What are these tasks? Where am I? What is going on? Who am I?"" I asked it unsure of what to say or think. 

""You are in Factorium 42. These tasks are why you are here, and you have signed a contract stipulating your employment for 365 days. One year to be precise, after such a time as per your contract you will be retired and replaced."" 

""Is no one else here?"" I asked. 

""No one but you and me 42."" It replied ominously. 

""Who are you?"" I asked it. 

""I am the Overseer. But you may call me just the Overseer ha ha."" It typed. 

""What they're the same thing."" I said confused. 

""See it's what you would call a joke 42."" It typed. 

""I see."" Was all I said. My head spinning. 

""Please perform your tasks 42."" It finished. 

A list of the 3 tasks lit up on the screen and I memorized them as best I could. My head was swimming from the smell of smoke in the air and the distant hum of machinery that never seemed to go away.

“Please insert your hand into the hand shaped hole below. Your non dominant hand if you please.” Overseer typed generating an arrow pointing towards the bottom right of the screen.

“Like this?” I asked sticking my arm into the hole feeling the circular metal of the tube as it went all the way to my left elbow.

“Please grip the handle with all fingers.” Overseer wrote.
An intense pain shot up my arm as something clamped onto my forearm. Needles dug into my skin from multiple access points and when I tried to remove my arm, I found that it was locked tight. The pain increased as drills sounded in the wall making me scream and writhe in pain, unable to control my rage and pain levels, I dropped to my knees.

 A bugle sounded from the machine, and I felt my arm slacken as it was freed. My arm came out wearing a large wristband with a small screen on it. The skin around where it had attached was red and raw, laced with small traces of blood. A smiley face popped up on the screen and Overseer typed a message on both screens.

“Congratulations 42, on a successful assimilation with your personal PDA. Your daily tasks will be displayed here as well as some instructions and tips on how to finish those tasks. You can also ask me any questions, and I will answer to the best of my ability.” 

“What the hell was that?” I asked, my voice raw from my screams.

“Pardon for the pain, but your PDA needed to be attached securely. It is your lifeline.” Overseer explained ignoring the main point of my question.

“Please proceed back to Factorium for further instructions on how to maintain the pumps.” Overseer wrote on my PDA his smiley face changing into an arrow that pointed at the door heading back to the main factory floor.

I re-entered Factorium and my foot grazed a metal bucket. I swear it hadn't been there before, or I would have seen it. It was a grey shiny metal and about the size of a milk pail. 

The hum of machinery echoed through my body making me wish for any form of earplug. I made my way down the rows. Examining the dozens of machines all running in tune with each other. The up and down motions perfect and synced.

My PDA dinged and flashed red. Its dings were constant and became increasingly louder as I coughed from the amount of smoke billowing out of the pump machines that cycled up and down like an oil derrick. Each machine had a bright red lever on one side and a small grate like mouth. At the top of each machine was a series of lights, all of them were green except the machine closest to me. It had turned red and flashed in time with my new PDA bracelet.

A sad smiley face, showed on the screen with each flash and Overseer typed a message.

“Pull the lever to open the grate, you will have fifteen seconds to clear the machine of the solid material thus freeing the gears. The machines cannot fall out of sync; your main job is to maintain the machines. It is of the utmost urgency, any failure to comply will result in loss of tokens and retribution.”

“What does that mean? Retribution?” I asked, wondering what sick punishment was linked with this disturbing place I had found myself working in.

“Retribution is defined as, punishment inflicted on someone as vengeance for a wrong or criminal act.” Overseer typed simply dodging my question again.

“That’s not what I meant.” I replied to my wrist, feeling foolish.

“Please perform the task as instructed.” Overseer replied while the screen turned slowly red.

With a heavy clunk, I pulled the lever on the pump downwards and with effort the grate clanged open, I walked around the machine with my bucket and reached into the core of the machine. My arm touching a black sludge that was turning solid. I took it away in handfuls and filled half my bucket quickly, I reached for one last handful and my finger grazed the sharp gear like teeth of the machine. Blood welled on my finger as it cut a small but deep cut into my thumb. The sludge smelled foul like smoke and death, without even needing to ask I knew it had to be some form of sewage being pumped through these machines, they were pumping some form of toxic waste. The cut on my finger got sludge on it and I rubbed my hand against my shirt hoping to clean it.

The siren exploded in my ears and the grate slammed closed by itself as the machine began to whir into life, I watched as the sludge began to pump again through the gears, a deep black liquid that flowed down through the top of the machine rotating the gears inside and allowing the machine to sync with the others.

“Good job, once you fill that bucket, you can dump the contents into the machine by the Break Room. It will supply you with one token per bucket full of the material.” Overseer declared as I wiped my hands and sucked on my thumb stemming the bleeding.

“Do you have any gloves I could have?” I asked Overseer.

“Gloves cost three tokens in the break room.” Overseer responded.

“That’s ridiculous, what about water?” I asked getting annoyed as I made my way back towards the Break Room. 

“Water is only one token. A fair system I would say. Don't you think?” Overseer said displaying a smiley face one more, this machines empty empathy was really starting to dig into my already bad temper.

“Whatever, where do I dump this stuff.” I said noticing a small alcove off to the side behind the machines.

As I approached my PDA dinged showing me an arrow to follow. It led me down the alcove and I came to a rudimentary work area; large tables covered in lights and tools dominated the room. The tables were stained with the black sludge of the machines. A large chute door stood in the center of the room. On the wall above it was an arrow carved into the metal with some sharp object a few words.

“You can fill the buckets with anything; O will never know the difference. Stupid AI, easy tokens. 41.”

The message had been signed with the number 41. As if the person before me had worked the same shift, done these same tasks. Did that mean 41 people had worked in this place before me, had this insane bracelet surgically attached to them and forced to pay for things with tokens.

My bracelet exploded in alarm making me jump. A red light flashed quickly making me panic for a moment, an arrow led me to another machine with a blinking red light. A siren sounded in the corner of Factorium near where the Coffin room was. I pulled the lever as Overseer sent me another message.

“Faster 42. These machines cannot fall out of sync.” 

I dug my hand into the sludge, filling the rest of my bucket as my fingers turned black with the foul smelling taint. As I grabbed the last chunk from the machine, the gears sliced my index finger drawing blood. I cursed and held my finger against my side as the grate slammed shut seconds after I removed my hand. My PDA dinged loudly as instructions flashed.

“Reset the lever 42, there seems to be a problem with its auto restart.” Overseer commanded.
As I pulled the lever I noticed another message from 41 scratched into the machine.
“This one’s crap, flip lever.” It said signing the bottom with 41.

I took a mental note of the machine's location and carried the black tar like substance to the chute; with one hand I wrenched the heavy door open as a strong smell took me in the nose. The chute smelled of rotting garbage. I felt bile jump to the back of my throat as I stifled my reaction. I braced myself and dumped the sludge into the blackness of the chute. 

A small change bowl built into the wall rattled as a single token rolled out coming to a stop in front of me. My black fingers smudging the yellow poker chip as I pocketed it. My head began to spin from the smoke billowing out of the dozens of machines. My bracelet dinged red once more as another of the machines went down. I dropped to one knee breathing fast, whatever was happening to me was happening fast. My vision swam in my head as if full of fish.

Overseer dinged my bracelet again, a message appearing.

“You seem to be suffering from a common side effect of working here. Smoke inhalation, please proceed to the Break Room and purchase an inhaler from the vending machine.” 

I crawled my way back the short distance to the Break Room my lungs coughing and hacking as I overworked myself. My vision began to darken as I made it inside the Break Room and closed the door behind me. The vending machine that dominated the middle of the room lit up in flashing lights, drawing my eye. The screen was a deep purple with green lettering, like a video game menu. Flashing arrows and input keys lit up the bottom half of the screen. The third option was air inhaler for one token. I pressed the down arrow twice and hit dispense on the machine. A large error message played, Insufficient funds. A slot on the right of the machine lit up bright and yellow. I jammed a token in the slot my hands feeling weak and sluggish as my mind still reeled from the smoke. With pained efforts I dispensed the air inhaler as I dropped to my knee again the nauseous feeling taking its toll.

A slot in the bottom of the machine opened as an item clanged down the chute. A bright green inhaler, like the kind you would see in hospitals. I grabbed it and inserted the one end into my shaking lips. With a firm press I descended the canister and felt a large blast enter my lungs. Instantly I felt better and after two more hits of the medicine. The inhaler emptied leaving me feeling remarkably better. I sat with my back on the machine breathing heavily as my head cleared and I was able to stand once more. 

With shaking hands, I scrolled through the vending machine seeing everything I could buy. The list seemed to go on for ever, most things I would need would be purchasable in this machine. Food items, water bottles, even clothing, and equipment. The machine had bright colours like a slot machine, and it made me feel like a kid at an arcade.

Overseer dinged my bracelet.

“The pumps 42. Do not let them get out of sync.” 

I opened the door to the Break Room and gazed out upon Factorium. The mechanical machines pumping and whirring, their large arms pumping up and down. As I watched, one red light turned on down the row. Then another, and another. My PDA dinged again and again as a siren sounded off on the far side of the room. I coughed as I covered my mouth with my shirt. My blackened hands grabbing my metal bucket as I fought through the smoke towards the first red light. This was going to be hell, but there was nowhere for me to go.

However, there has been **no communication** from SKPM as to whether or not this actually was impacting water pressure or causing other water issues.

**Grade: FAIL**

**SECURITY**: SKPM have changed the 4 hour security coverage to start at 6 p.m. until 10 p..m.

**Grade: PASS**  (However, they did not follow through with a survey to ask Residents for their preferred choice of times. Instead it was done based on consensus of a number of Residents present at the meeting.)     

**WATER QUALITY**:  SKPM  have FAILED to follow though on their promise to make water testing kits available.  

**Grade: FAIL**

Instead the Summerhill Tenants Association have made this option available for 7 Jackes Avenue Residents by contacting the City of Toronto Plumbing Specialist who “…. has been in the building and will visit you and INSPECT YOUR UNIT ON REQUEST TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. HE CAN ALSO TEST YOUR PRESSURE, WATER FLOW AND QUALITY OF WATER, AND NOTE YOUR WATER RELATED STORIES OF YOUR UNIT…. CALL OR EMAIL: Jacob Tassone: Cell # (416) 392-0480 or Email: J[acob.Tassone@toronto.ca](mailto:jacob.Tassone@toronto.ca)

**HANDICAP ACCESS** \- SKPM stated they will not move on this item anytime soon.  Unfortunately it seems that it may take a Human Rights Challenge by a Resident to force SKPM to rectify this egregious lack of respect for the dignity of any disabled Residents.

**Grade: FAIL**

**COMMUNICATIONS:**  I have not seen any improvement with spelling or grammar for SKPM communications.

**Grade: FAIL**

**WATER SHUTDOWNS**: The last shut down was initially scheduled for 15 Apr 2025 but rescheduled, after the STA pushed back at the timing during the Easter and Passover time frames. Shutdown was done on 22 Apr 2025. Since that time there have been NO water shut downs!

**Grade: (Potential) PASS**

**AMAZON DROP BOXES**: No information forthcoming from SKPM to date on this issue.

**Grade: FAIL**

**BUILDING EMERGENCY CONTACT**:  SKPM provided the following notice :

*The Emergency After Hours Action Line is operational from 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM. This has always been the correct number and will connect you directly to Sterling Karamar’s Head Office. Please listen carefully to the prompts to report your emergency and press ‘1’ to speak with the emergency operator.*

*For after-hours emergencies, please contact on-site staff first at 437-922-4503 if* *you are unable to reach them, then call the Action Line. This line is to report immediate emergencies only,  such as:*

* *Floods*
* *Fires*
* *Loss of vital services (e.g., heat or water)*

All other matters should be reported during regular business hours.

**Grade: PASS** (Unless we find out this does not work when actually used by a Resident.)

**BOOSTER PUMP**: A new Booster Pump has been ordered. Hover, the current pump is working properly and the new one will be used as a backup until needed. 

SKPM have sent out a Communication Alert.  “… Dear Residents of 7 Jackes Avenue, his (spelling error) is a project notification for a Booster Pump Replacement scheduled to commence on June 30, 2025. We expect the renovation last approximately (grammar error) 1 week; however, this is only an estimate, and the scheduled timelines are subject to change,  as needed. Scope of the work includes, but not limited to, replacement of booster pump. ….”

Evidently the current Booster Pump does actually need to be replaced  in spite of what Residents were told that it would be a backup pump.

Do buses to the airport run until late at night?

""Motion on vector three-six-zero!""

The alert screeched across the command net, static-laced and panicked. Gurrash blinked against the dust clogging his optical plates. Something massive moved through the haze—no heat signature, no thruster trail. Just noise. Violence.

And then it happened again.

FWOOOOM-BOOM.

A thunderclap split the air, and from the torn earth launched a figure.

A black silhouette, angular and brutish. It rose in an arc—spinning once, twice, a wide-armed leap more akin to a boulder fired from a catapult than anything airborne. Fire and smoke trailed behind it. A single, shoulder-mounted launcher still sizzled as it ejected the backwash of a depleted rocket-propelled grenade.

The human—if it could still be called that—tumbled mid-air with perfect balance, both legs tucked tight, the other shoulder-plate steaming. It crashed into the rooftop of a nearby structure like a meteor. The ferrocrete buckled beneath the armored weight, and shards scattered like broken ice.

A Shalkrith sniper on that roof turned just in time to see a gauntleted fist grab his throat. There was a strangled cry, a blur, and then the alien was hurled from the roof like discarded meat.

The human—laughing audibly through the feed—then spun, aimed down, and fired again.

BOOM.

He shot the ground.

His armor cannoned him off the rooftop like a living siege weapon. Arms wide, helmet catching the sun, he soared overhead like a black-plated god of war before crashing through the upper level of a second building, sending wall panels and shrieking enemies flying in all directions.

Gurrash felt his claws tremble on the grip of his rifle. “How are they doing this?” he croaked.

“They have no integrated flight packs,” rasped one of the analysts behind him. “No repulsors. No grav-harnesses. That… that is a tank-killer. They are standing on tank-killers.”

“This defies physics,” another muttered.

“They are not using physics!” Gurrash roared.

Then came the worst one yet.

A shadow. Fast. Low. Wide.

Another marine—this one trailing twin streams of black smoke. Two launchers. One on each arm. The armored beast aimed the left one downward.

FWOOOOM.

It catapulted him high over the battlefield—his armor’s burnished plating catching every glint of shattered sunlight. In the air, he rotated, angled forward—and with the right launcher, fired into the heart of an enemy bastion.

CRACK-THOOM.

The shell landed with unholy precision, erupting in a plume of white-hot debris and plasma feedback. The timing. The velocity. It was a precision artillery strike—with himself as the targeting drone.

As he landed, he skidded feet-first through ash, chunks of wall pinging harmlessly off his armor. He rose and yelled, “Direct hit, baby!”

“Who are these things?” Gurrash hissed. “Why are they like this?”

Another alarm.

Vector two-niner-zero. Something inbound. Fast.

“Is that… another one? That trajectory’s far too steep for—wait, where is he going?”

From the clouds came the human again—but higher. He was aimed not at the ground this time, but at a Shalkrith airframe, a sleek multi-wing fighter swooping to engage.

The human collided with it.

Right into the canopy glass.

With a screech of rending metal, he tore open the cockpit. The pilot inside screamed as the human ripped him free—one arm wrenching the pilot out like a spoiled fruit from its shell, and then flung the alien into open sky.

The marine climbed inside.

The comm feed from the Shalkrith air battalion filled with screams and static. The fighter banked hard, performed a full roll, and then began tearing through its own formation.

“They are hijacking the air support—” someone bellowed.

Gurrash stared, numb. “He used an explosive to jump onto a plane.”

The command net broke into chaos as the stolen fighter strafed the battlefield, human laughter distorted through the hijacked channel.

> “Hey boys—guess who learned to fly.”

Brrrtt-brrrrtttt.

“WOOOO!”

The footage still played.

“Who the hell gave Kowalski two launchers?”

“He requisitioned a second after the first one ‘wasn’t dramatic enough,’ ma’am,” replied Lieutenant Carver.

Ross growled. “And Jackson just hijacked a jet?”

“Yes, ma’am. Using... bodyboarding tactics.”

“…Do we even train them anymore, or do we just let the armor and explosives babysit their idiot brains while they improvise their way through a warzone?”

“Hard to say, ma’am. But the kill ratio is twenty-three to one in our favor.”

Ross blinked. “You know what? Good. Fine. Let them rocket-jump. Let them juggle RPGs like it’s a damned circus. Just—when one of them explodes themselves into pink vapor, I’m not writing a letter to their mother.”

Carver hesitated. “I think most of their mothers would just say they’re proud.”

Ross stared into her empty coffee cup like it had wronged her.

Admittedly this isn't something that the fans have any real control over, but what would be on your wish list of things to be featured?

From my perspective, I find that it has been enjoyable  to see a mixture of familiar faces and newcomers, along with a similar balance of content between annual events such as the harvest and one-off activities and would like to see this continue for a long as the show does.

I know there are still things left for Jeremy Clarkson to try (Alpaca farming perhaps?) but I don't feel the need for the show to try and introduce even more radical ideas, just to keep people's attention, rather than being a genuine attempt to make things as profitable as possible, as has been the case so far with the farm shop and now the pub.

I guess I am saying that I want it to still be grounded in reality (such as the paint marker attachment for the seed drill) rather than trying something that stands no chance of working (like growing coffee) or feels like it is only being done for sheer spectacle (such as hiring a fleet of combine harvesters to try and complete the harvest in record time).

So for my part, I would like to see what would happen if Jeremy Clarkson decided to look at more ways to make farming more sustainable, such as alternatives to diesel fuel for tractors - it's still early days, but hydrogen fuel is being considered in the UK (rather than going electric) and it would be interesting to see what Jeremy, Kaleb and even Charlie make of the technology, even if it ultimately turns out to be a non-starter.",0,1749925312.0,ClarksonsFarm,7,0.33,False

TL;DR: My ex made comments to me that seemed to target my self-esteem, such as ""I like that people know you're whipped,"" and ""your brain is broken"" because of my autism spectrum disorder. She also had unprotected sex with me without my consent. Was I in an abusive relationship?

I have a question about my first (and as of now, most recent) relationship. Almost five years ago in 2020, I dated my first serious girlfriend for 3 months. She was 19 and I was 22. I broke up with her, after which she told me that what I did was disgusting, that I'm a child, and that I'll never have someone as good as her again. That's what she told me after we broke up, but when we talked a couple years later, the story changed, and now I don't know which version of events to believe.

I broke up with her after a specific incident. She regularly changed her career goals/plans/school plans, and did so several times in our short relationship. She called me one day to vent to me that she had no idea what she wanted to do with her life, and that she felt like she needed to have a proper career ASAP. I don't remember exactly what I said to her, but it was something along the lines of ""we don't have to have it all figured out at this age."" Her tone of the voice on the phone quickly changed to being more serious and she ended the phone call shortly after. She then texted me to tell me that what I was trying to manipulate her with what I said, that what I did was was disgusting, and that I better work harder to be better or else she's going to have to break up with me. She accused me of trying to control her.

Later that evening, she invited me to her place where she was sobbing in bed. She said she was so sorry for lashing out at me, and I apologized for what I said to her. I can't deny that that night, I just didn't feel the connection or attraction I once did. She had threatened to break up with me before if I didn't get my anxiety in check (which is obviously valid), and frequently told me I was incredibly lucky to be with her, and that I better not mess things up because I'll never have someone as good as her ever again. At the same time, she was allowed to have anxious moments and huge venting sessions with me all the time when I wasn't allowed to show signs of anxiety around her.

While she accused me of being controlling, I felt like she was to me, and I don't know if I'm allowed to feel that way. One time in a clothing stores she told me I couldn't buy a shirt I wanted, and when she left the shop she said ""all the staff noticed when I told you to put that shirt away. I like that they know you're whipped.""

She also made fun of my autism spectrum disorder a lot, saying my ""brain is broken."" Or I would make an observation or statement, and she'd say ""well you're autistic so you can't know any better.""

She also told me at the beginning of the relationship that she found me attractive and loved my blue eyes, but later in the relationship she told me she hated that she was dating a white man with blue eyes, and regularly said that white men are ""literally fucking disgusting."" That's obviously a completely valid opinion, but I can't deny that the words ""literally fucking disgusting"" have stuck with me. When I hear the term ""disgusting""/""literally disgusting""/""literally fucking disgusting"" used in a political context, I feel like my heart skips a beat. I feel so guilty for this when I'm literally so incredibly privileged, and I feel like I therefore shouldn't take issue with her disliking men and not liking my ethnic features.

She also technically sexually assaulted me, but I hate using that term when the vast majority of sexual assaults are more traumatic. We were agreeing to use condoms at the time, but one day she told me how she feels disappointed in herself for not having a kid and a professional career yet. Later that night, while we were fooling around a bit in bed at her place, she got on top of me and put me inside without a condom. I completely froze in fear, as in the past when I told her I wasn't comfortable with something sexual, she always lashed out at me for not telling me sooner, regardless of the fact that I told her as soon as I felt the way I did (at least that's how I remember it). She had previously told me that I was never allowed to ""falsely accuse her of sexual assault,"" as she said a previous boyfriend did that. It was only this year that I stopped blaming myself for it. I always blamed myself

The day after the phone call lash-out and apology at her house, it was Friday, and that night I went to her place, and told her I didn't see a future with her any more, and that I wanted to break up. She immediately started screaming and crying and kicked me out. I feel like I'll never forget the sounds of her screams from inside the house as I walked away down the driveway.

A couple weeks after that, she wanted to meet up and talk. She told me that she wouldn't have dated me if she knew I was a 22 year old child, that what I did was disgusting, that I abandoned her, that I shouldn't date for a very, very long time, and that I could have broken up with her in *literally* any other way and it would have been better. I cried while she said these things to me on a park bench, and then when she told me I could go, I apologized one last time, started walking away, and then she called me back to hug me one last time.

Two years later in 2022, she called me to apologize and to tell me that she was too harsh to me. She told me that she's a naturally dramatic person, and that I did the best I could to get out of a situation that clearly wasn't good for me, which is the exact opposite of what she said before (that any other way to break up with her would have been better). We both apologized for things and wished each other well, but I decided that I didn't want to stay in touch. She was interested in maybe meeting for a coffee to catch up, but I was terrified of seeing her again (though I didn't tell her that). That was the last time I talked to her, and it's now 2025.

Is it okay for me to start allowing myself to believe the things she told me in 2022? I still think that the way I broke up with her was disgusting, but I also think I was just trying to get out for my own self-preservation.

Based on what I just wrote, is it okay for me to start thinking she was abusive in that relationship? As I said, I stopped blaming myself for the assault this year, but I still don't blame her for it because she always presented herself as a strong woman who can't do wrong. I had a long talk with a crisis hotline about this yesterday as I was having a really rough day, and the person I spoke to said that if my ex said things to me in order to hurt my self-esteem, then that's abusive. That put things into a new perspective for me, and I'm curious to hear what others have to say.

Whatever it was, it felt more like unboxing a new piece of consumer tech than a kitchen appliance.

1lbf6en,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1lbf6en/my_mum_is_abusive_to_my_employees/,My mum is abusive to my employees,"I own a cafe. It started as a pipe dream that became a reality. It's even gotten really popular recently. I'm proud of it and I've got a good team, I should be happy, but it's been a fucking nightmare.

When I started the business my mum wanted to be involved, she's a retired accountant so I reckoned it would be really helpful if she did the accounts, payroll, tax etc, and I'd pay her dividends on top of the money I owe her - borrowed a bit from my family to get things started.

That's how I wanted things to be. Fair, simple, I'm doing my thing, she still gets to use her skills, we both profit from it. But literally from day one she's been showing up and doing stuff that's not in her role. I won't give you the whole story but it's got to the point where she's not only trying to micromanage my employees, she's even been bullying them.

Recently she threw a dirty cloth at an employee and shouted at him to clean the coffee machine instead of what he was doing at the time - he was doing something also useful at the time, and it was in the middle of the day when the cafe was very busy. He said that was unacceptable, and when I found out what happened I said the same.

A couple of days later she threw a stack of paper cups at him because he'd miscounted our stock of paper cups. Again he confronted her, then she came to me raging about him ""answering back"" to her. 

I tried to explain that when I said throwing stuff at people was completely unacceptable that meant that throwing stuff at people was completely unacceptable. She responded that it was unacceptable that he'd ""answered back"" to her, and that ""even if I'd hit him, he shouldn't have the right to talk to me like that.""

At that point I didn't know what to do except just get her to go home and leave us alone. I'm really disturbed that she said that, and I actually do think she meant it. 

I'm trying to do what I can to keep her away from the place. I've tried talking to my dad and my brother about it, and while they're sympathetic, they don't see this side of her and they don't really get what I'm saying. 

The other thing is she can be fine when she's there. In fact there's lots of times she's really great with both staff and customers. And she enjoys being involved and I don't want to take that away from her. But I'm also worried about how emotionally invested she is in this.

A year ago, after a similar incident with a staff member, I tried to draw a hard line and tell my mum that she couldn't be involved anymore. She literally broke down in tears and begged me to let her keep working there. I said no, and it was the fucking hardest thing I've ever had to do.

Then I talked to a couple my employees, the ones who'd taken most of the flak in fact, and, well, we all ended up more worried about her mental health than ourselves so we let her back in. And now a year later she's doing the same shit but to an even more extreme degree.

So now I've got one employee with grounds for legal action (which tbh I'd support him in) and another one threatening to quit because she's fed the fuck up with having this emotional drama all the time at her job - and I don't fucking blame her.

Then there's me, having spent my late 20s and early 30s trying to build up this business, and the whole time having to worry about what mental shit my mum is going to do next and how to damage control for it. 

I'm so fucking exhausted from it all.
