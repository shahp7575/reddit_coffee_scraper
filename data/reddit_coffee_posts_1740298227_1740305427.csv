I’m thinking about purchasing a machine to make my overall coffee making experience ‘simpler’. I’ve been using my dripper and v60 for years but recently my wife has gotten into coffee and selling her on the full process has been rather difficult. 

I’m looking for a decent bean to cup or semi automatic machine so she can effectively just ‘press a button’ and make us a decent coffee. 

I have a decent grinder already (wilfa uniform) so I’m happy to carry on grinding myself but I just want something to simplify the process. I did look at the Aiden but James’ recent review has made me think it might not be fit for my specific purpose. 

Just hoping those with more expertise might be able to help or advise this might be a fools errand! TIA! ",1,1740305076.0,JamesHoffmann,1,1.0,False

Beautiful violet flowers, strong rounded leaves, the whole package. I brought her home, gave her a decorative pot and kept her in my bedroom for my husband and I to admire. That was yesterday. 

This morning, after breakfast, my husband decided to clean a little. Do the dishes, sweep, make the bed. I, however, stayed downstairs sipping my coffee. My gravest mistake. 

I hear a crash, then, I hear my husband call my name. I rush upstairs, to see the crime scene. My beautiful African Violet, Pookie, how back on the windowsill, had taken a fall to the ground. Flower side down. My husband with a broom, apologizing, explaining it was a blanket and it got caught on Pookie’s flowers, that led to her demise. 

I examine her, a few broken leaves and flowers, and a cracked decorative pot. Not fatal, but still cause for concern. I rush her downstairs, which leads us to now. Pookie has been removed from her decorative pot, dusted off, put under my grow light, and given plant food ( flower specific). Do I cut her broken leaves and flowers, or let her keep her battle scars as trophies? She’s a resilient one. She will recover. My Pookie( picture provided.

However, when I play the Lambs to the Slaughter story and repel the CIA attack, my terror bar just keeps on increasing until I am eventually killed. This keeps happening even with a new Capo (and half my empire shut down). Is this supposed to be this way or is it a bug? I ended up giving up on this questline because it's difficult as is and the magically rising terror makes it unbeatable.

With Crashing the System, I seem to run out of money soon after hiring Wagner, as my coffee/opium and coffee/cannabis supply chains don't seem to be making enough money, and I also have to research everything so I have no money left over to invest in supply chains. I tried to look up online guides to set up my businesses better, but every guide I've seen so far shows that they have some of the basic research already done at the start of the level (level 2 farms, gravel and asphalt roads, workshops, all the good stuff) and so can spend their money setting up large empires. Did the devs change the level to remove this starting advantage, or is this another bug?

I love this game a lot and am hoping to get many hours more out of survival and sandbox, but it's frustrating that despite restarting these 2 stories over and over for about 3 weeks now, I keep hitting these unreasonably difficult features/bugs and failing the story.

I accept donated ingredients, but it's not necessary to pick up something.  If you donate expired/rotting food I will block you.

I do not do special requests, bake sales, and non profits, so don't ask.  If you see something posted you want to pick up to give to a charity that would be great.  

But do not try to arrange something for me to make things for a specific reason.  My anxiety cannot handle it.

Please do not come here and suggest I take a class, or sell baked goods. That is ablist, unsupportive, and upsetting.

I think this would go without saying, but you need to tell me if you cannot make it.  After I wait an hour no call no show, I will move onto the next person.  If this happens repeatedly I will block you.  No exceptions.

I feel this goes without saying as well but I need to say it.  if you send me a message asking to borrow money I will block you.  No exceptions.

I am autistic/ADHD, and am the only one doing this, so please be kind.

Today, I have 6 coffee cake muffins to give away.

They are big muffins, like two muffins in one.  So 6 is like getting a dozen muffins.

It's a really moist muffin, I put in some chai seasoning from the other day, it's a very subtle difference.

Dark brown sugar, a brown sugar chai seasoning layer in the middle, a strusel topping with butter, seasoning, flour and sugar, and then icing drizzled on top.

I was thinking about the coffee cake Costco muffins from when I was a kid.  So I made a double batch so I can have some and someone else can pick these up.  I am keeping 6 of the smaller ones, and giving away 6 of the bigger muffins.

It's 6 muffins for one household.

# The Hidden AI Revolution In VSCode

Visual Studio Code isn't just for developers anymore. With the right extensions and AI models, it becomes a complete business automation powerhouse. I'm talking about building entire applications with a single prompt - and doing it all for free.

# The Three-Tool Stack That Changes Everything

The secret lies in combining:

* Visual Studio Code (The Foundation)
* OpenRouter API (The Brain)
* Client 3.4 (The Magic Connector)

Together, they form an AI-powered development environment that's more powerful than most dev teams I've worked with.

# Beyond Simple Websites

# Interactive Applications

Created a full SEO task management game in minutes, complete with experience points and level-ups.

# AI-Powered Analysis Tools

Built a real-time news aggregator that pulls from current events and creates custom landing pages.

# Custom Game Development

Developed SEO Space Invaders - a fully functional game that teaches SEO while entertaining.

# The MCP Server Revolution

Client 3.4's latest update quietly introduced something revolutionary: MCP servers. Think of them as AI-powered bridges to your favorite apps:

# Instant Integrations

* Stripe for payments
* Airtable for databases
* Google Calendar for scheduling

[part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1iu4kvk/homework_bestie_part_8/)

We finally finished her history homework, and Jenny let out a satisfied sigh, stretching her arms over her head. “Okay, that’s enough schoolwork for today,” she said with a grin. “Stay and hang out for a bit?”

I hadn’t expected her to ask, but the second she did, warmth spread through my chest. She wanted me to stay—not to help with chores, not to do her homework, just to spend time together.

“Yeah, of course,” I said, trying to sound casual even though I was probably smiling too much.

We moved to her bed, sitting cross-legged across from each other. The room was dimly lit, her bedside lamp casting a soft glow around us. We talked about random things—our teachers, upcoming tests, stupid drama happening at school. It felt easy, comfortable, like we weren’t just friends because I was always doing things for her.

Then, out of nowhere, Jenny tilted her head at me and asked, “So… do you like anyone?”

I froze for a split second, my stomach twisting into knots.

Did she know? Was she asking because she had a feeling? Was this my chance to finally tell her?

I swallowed hard and forced a small laugh. “Nah, not really.”

Lying felt awful, but I couldn’t risk it. If I told her I was in love with her, everything could change. She might laugh it off, say something like, *Aww, that’s sweet,* and then move on like it was nothing. Or worse—she might feel weird around me after that.

Jenny raised an eyebrow. “Really? No one at all?”

“Nope,” I said, shaking my head. “What about you?”

She smiled, and for a second, I felt hope flicker in my chest.

“Actually, yeah,” she said, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “I kinda have a crush on someone.”

The flicker of hope immediately died.

“Oh,” I said, trying to keep my voice neutral. “Who?”

She hesitated for a moment before finally saying, “You know Daniel Reyes? From our math class?”

I felt like I’d been punched in the stomach.

Of course, *him.*

Daniel Reyes was tall, confident, and effortlessly cool. He played soccer, always had girls laughing at his jokes, and had this easy charm that made people want to be around him. He was exactly the kind of guy girls like Jenny went for—a *real* guy, someone who didn’t spend his nights running errands and raking leaves just to get a smile from her.

Jenny didn’t seem to notice the way my expression faltered because she kept talking, a dreamy look in her eyes. “He’s just so hot, you know? And he’s funny. And, like, he has this way of talking where everything he says sounds so confident.” She sighed, flopping back onto the bed. “Ugh, I feel so dumb, but I can’t help it.”

I forced a short laugh, pretending like I wasn’t crumbling inside. “Yeah, uh… I get it.”

But I *didn’t* get it.

What did Daniel have that I didn’t? Was it just that he was good-looking? More confident? More of a *man*?

I clenched my fists, jealousy burning in my chest. Jenny had found someone real—someone worthy of her. And I was just *me.* A guy who brought her coffee, helped her with homework, and raked her mom’s leaves.

As Jenny gushed about Daniel, her eyes lighting up with excitement, I felt a sharp pang of jealousy twist in my gut. She talked about how hot he was, how confident, how funny. How he always seemed to know exactly what to say to make her laugh. I clenched my fists, forcing myself to nod along, pretending to be just the supportive friend.

But deep down, I hated it. Hated the way she looked when she talked about him. Hated that it wasn’t me.

But at the same time… it felt right.

Of course Jenny would want someone like Daniel. He was tall, athletic, effortlessly cool—the kind of guy girls actually *wanted.* Not some guy who spent his free time running errands for her, raking her lawn, and helping her with history homework. She deserved someone strong, someone she could admire. Not someone like me.

And yet, as that realization sank in, something unexpected happened. Instead of feeling just jealousy and sadness, I felt something else, something deeper—*arousal.*

The thought of Jenny being with Daniel, of her being taken by a *real man,* while I stayed in my place, serving her, doing whatever she needed without expecting anything in return… it made my whole body heat up.

I imagined it. Her in his arms. Him kissing her. Holding her close. Meanwhile, I’d still be here, ready to do whatever she asked, knowing she’d never look at me the way she looked at him. And that was okay.

It was how it was supposed to be.

She must’ve noticed I had gone quiet because she nudged me with her elbow, pulling me out of my thoughts. “Hey,” she said, smiling. “You okay?”

I nodded quickly, swallowing down everything I was feeling. “Yeah, just… surprised, I guess.”

She laughed. “Why? You didn’t think I’d have a crush on someone?”

I shook my head. “No, I just… I didn’t know you liked Daniel.”

She sighed, flopping back onto her bed. “Yeah, but it’s whatever. I don’t think he even knows I exist like that.”

I highly doubted that. Jenny was gorgeous. Of course Daniel noticed her. How could he not? But I didn’t say that. Instead, I just forced a small smile.

“You never know,” I said. “Maybe he does.”

She turned her head to look at me, grinning. “Think you could find out for me?”

And just like that, I was being pulled in again. Doing things for her. Helping her with the guy she actually wanted.

And even though it hurt, I still nodded. “Yeah. I can try.”

She squealed, reaching over to pull me into a tight hug. “You’re the best! What would I do without you?”",3,1740304122.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Hi. Around 4 months ago I decided to cut out dating apps and casual hook ups. This isn't my first time doing SR, but what caused relapses last year was that I was practicing some Dark Alchemy (Gray Tantra) solo practices. I've since quit to give wholesomeness a chance.  
I have experience with power lock ejaculation control, but I'm currently reading Cupid's Poisoned Arrow for the 2nd time, which is about Karezza. 

  
Now that you have my background, there are 3 women that I'm interested in. **They all have different habits, and it might potentially be affecting my level of attraction to them.** 

# Different Habits, Different Attraction

The first woman, we haven't had any physical contact so idk if she actually likes me, but she's very friendly and has a great smile. However, she's divorced, buys a lot of alcohol, (and even has a small roach problem). All the simulations in my head of us having sex, it always ends in me releasing. She is actually the least pretty of the 3 but, it's just how I feel. 

  
The second woman, super friendly, and she initiated breaking touch barrier. I was actually a bit guarded against her at first because her personality is so cheery and I can't tell if it's fake. When I hugged her for the 2nd time, I felt like her body was kind of hollow somehow, and considered that maybe my instincts about her were correct. However, she's been so consistent that she's starting to grow on me. It's hard to tell what her habits are, I feel like she goes to clubs or parties, but I'm not sure. I've seen her place (for professional reasons) and it's relatively clean, always smells great. But when I run the simulation, I do have a strong resistance to releasing with her, because of that ""hollow"" feeling. I know what position would put me in danger with her though, but I mostly think about just her pleasure if we were to do it. 

The third woman, actually the prettiest one, taps my arm or gets close to me like every 30 seconds. She's into meditation, art, and is sober, so the best habits. Once again, our difference in personality makes me a little guarded, but I know she's not fake. At first I worried a bit if she was this touchy with everyone, but I think her interest in me is genuine.  
  
As for the simulation, I don't think about penetration at all. I actually just want to study her energy a bit more. We had a group meditation session today, and next time I'll ask if she wants to experiment by holding hands during the meditation.  
  
Out of the 3, she's the only one I'm willing to sit down and have coffee with. The 2nd woman, I've only thought about getting coffee to-go and then going straight to her apartment lol. The first woman, nah. 



# Conclusion: 

Visualization is important for me. There have been a lot of studies and anecdotes about its use in sports. My favorite is Jon Jones' story about how he kept seeing himself getting KO'd standing vs. Rampage Jackson, [so instead he decided to start the fight crawling. ](https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/jon-jones-reveals-he-crawled-out-to-fight-quinton-rampage-jackson-in-order-to-avoid-a-nightmare/)He ended up dominating the fight. 

With God's help (just a phrase) I should really let go of the 1st woman. 

But overall I think my psyche is moving in the right direction, as lately I've been internalizing the facts from *Cupid's Poisoned Arrow* and reviewing my own experiences, and have been developing a different self-image; That maybe I truly am the guy only for women who want something *totally different.* I know a bit more time in celibacy will help strengthen those values and cement that identity. Quite an enjoyable arc. ",3,1740303911.0,Semenretention,0,0.8,False
1iw6mzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/1iw6mzc/i_think_my_sister_almost_got_kidnapped/,I think my sister almost got kidnapped,"It was a Sunday morning and me and my family just had church and we went to a nearby store to grab some food. So me and my sister brought out tablets inside (since were only like 10 and 13 and addicted to our devices) to listen to our music while we eat. My grandparents were ordering our food and me and my sister stood beside them just playing on our tablets. my sister had her back turned to the entrance so she couldn't see what was going behide her, and I was in front of her, facing her. While my sister was distracted by Playing on her device and my grandparents were still ordering the food I just stood there in my own world. jamming out to some music.

 Until this tall thin old man with a brownish Beanie and dirty clothes came sprinting in and went towards us, like, straight to us like he knew we would be there at that exact moment and just stood behide my sister. The most disturbing part was his smile, he was smiling ear to ear and his teeth was stained with yellowish gunk. Like he was drinking coffee 24/7. he was obviously homeless by the way he was dressed. 

He just stood there in front of everybody in the store just staring at my older sister and she was still distracted by her tablet and her back was turned against him, so she couldn't see him. Being a ten year old just wanting some food after singing her little heart out at church, I was scared sh*tless.
The man just stared at my sister, looking at her like a predator looking at it's prey. I knew I have to do something, so I clear my throat to get the older man's attention and just stared at him with anger, pure hate and disgust. And mind you I was a 10 year old girl who is extremely tall. And that must've scared this man away so he ran out of that store so fast.

 Now this is the weird part, my sister didn't notices this whole interaction with me and the old man. She was either that she was too distracted by her tablet or that the Interaction was just my imagination.

I still think about this and it still scares me

I was so funny,I had great time and after the morning coffee, that was it. My mood had skyrocketed to the moon and didn't want to come back. 

I'm not saying that I had everything figured out so it was completely coming from inside.

I was extremely smart, clever and witty and I couldn't not have an opinion about a subject for which I would say my thoughts in a very fun way because I wasn't taking anything seriously.

Now it's just a habit. I can not think straight, I can not think out of the ""normal"" which makes something intresting in the human ear and brain.
When I'm saying habit, I mean I remember how i behaved back in the days and I try to mimic that but because it's not coming naturally, the result is not the same. I don't have the vibe anymore

I turned into a very boring, serious and unenthusiastic human that even when he wants to make fun it doesn't come out like it used to. I lost my charisma. I can tell that I ve changed like completely and I try to persuade my psychologist, but it's not their job to examine my behaviour. I'm cured as they said and this is their job.

I'm not depressed by any mean but I really miss my old self.

I'm trying to be productive but it's not the same. Nothing works. I fear that this is my new self and I need to embrace it but I really don't like it.

i think about how my father would react and what he’d do. i don’t think he’d drive me to the hospital because that would take much longer, so he’d probably call the police. i’m thinking about my neighbors or people who live in the neighborhood. what would they say? my father would probably be so embarrassed but he should’ve seen this coming.

the people i don’t talk to anymore, my old coworkers, old teachers, old acquaintances, i wonder if they’d ever get the news and how would they find out. they already haven’t seen me in a long time, i’ve deleted my socials and my father is very private. there’s almost no way they would know i’m gone forever.

i think about these random people on reddit replying on my posts, and strangers i met once and am burned in their memory because i complimented them or did something cringe, i wonder if i’m in someone’s dreams or if i’m in someone’s favorite memory.

i’ve seen a lot of movies and there’s a bunch more i haven’t seen. i don’t have a favorite movie so i wonder if there’s a movie out there that when i see it once i’ll say “wow that’s my favorite movie”. same with songs. i listen to a lot and enjoy a lot but i haven’t found one to be my all time favorite. they’re probably not even out yet.

one day i’ll stop thinking all these thoughts and stop feeling the way i’m feeling and be at peace and i genuinely cannot wait.

the title says it all.. im 22AFAB and struggle to stabilise my weight!!!!! i want to feel less tired during the day!!!!! this post is kinda long but I’d appreciate it if you read it. i tried to provide as much details as necessary for clarity.

i started at 176lb ish/80kg & i’m 170cm tall if it matters. i’ve lost about 12lb/~5.6kg (now around 165lb/75.7 kg) in barely 3 weeks and i dont feel good about it. i was hospitalised for a bit because of my declining mental health and its consequences on my body.

my medical team let me know my weight loss wasnt healthy bc my body is struggling to sustain itself (blood work & muscle/fat analysis on that cool scale ikyk). i managed to gain only 4lbs in the hospital since i was fed 3 meals a day and was given 2 snacks between meals. they suggested that i work out to at least build some muscle + it would make me hungrier and more likely to eat all my meals at home. 

since i’ve been discharged i started going to the gym and doing muscle training 3x a week under the supervision of a trainer & a physical therapist.
im exhausted bc idk what to eat before/after a workout.

my goal is to eat AT LEAST two meals a day, focusing on breakfast + dinner so i dont take my medication on an empty stomach. i get nauseous and dizzy from them so i cant eat much even when im hungry. and i sometimes have to skip gym days sometimes bc of it :( it’s only been a two weeks since i was discharged and i dont feel better.

my breakfast usually consists of 2 small slices of rye or sourdough bread + a banana + coffee with a splash of oat milk (i tried soy milk but no matter what brand it makes me throw up). 

dinner is whatever delicious dish my beloved mum comes up with and i focus on meat/fish and veggies (we always have them steamed). it’s when i tend to eat the most. she makes me lentil soup or chickpea dishes w brown rice to help me when i struggle to eat <3

i want to make breakfast into a habit. but warm foods like porridge make me feel sick. i used to whisk in an egg and frozen berries (coach suggestion) and it did it all..! im losing hope :( i dont want to lose more muscle :(

i used to eat eggs but ive been told i need to watch my cholesterol lvls, so i can only have 4 a week (dr’s orders). and i’m lactose intolerant so no yogurt, butter, kefir or cheese :( i’ve tried peanut butter but i have to force myself.

Current Weight - 143 kg

Goal Weight - 110 kg

Just a few questions, I’m new to the OMAD, haven’t yet begun as i’m still researching.

I have heard mixed things about when you eat specifically time wise, is there any difference in results as to when you eat for example have meal at 10:00am then next day at 2pm then next day at 11:00am and so on. Is there any benefit of the randomised times? I have heard that if you eat at a set time everyday it can be not as effective as your body gets used to it? Should it be a set amount of fasted hours each day or randomised? Not sure if that makes sense hopefully someone can help!!

Also I play team sports specifically AFL, on game day I feel I would need to eat a brunch meal and then play my game and refuel with a meal after the game, is this something that may affect my weight loss or due to the energy expenditure in a game I should be fine?

I also see lots of people talking about having black coffee or tea as something in the fast between meals, i’m not much of a coffee or tea drinker, would it make much difference if I had like a Pepsi Max or something in between meals to change it up from water? I’m assuming going cold turkey from soft drink is obviously the better route.

Hopefully this all makes sense, any advice would be amazing!! Cheers :)",0,1740302799.0,omad,1,0.5,False

When it comes to shopping and dining, many consumers look for flexibility in their payment options. One common question that arises is, ""Can you use a Target gift card in Starbucks?"" Understanding the purchasing power of gift cards is essential for savvy shoppers.

Target gift cards can be used at any Target location as well as on Target's website. While many people enjoy their Starbucks coffee on the go, it's important to note that Starbucks is not directly affiliated with Target. This distinction means that Target gift cards cannot be used for purchases at Starbucks cafés or drive-thrus.

However, there are strategies to utilize a Target gift card indirectly for Starbucks purchases. Here are a few options:

- **Purchase Starbucks Gift Cards:** Use your Target gift card to buy a Starbucks gift card in-store. This will allow you to then use that Starbucks gift card at any participating location.
- **Shop at Target:** Purchase items at Target that might include Starbucks products, such as bags of coffee or merchandise. This allows you to enjoy Starbucks at home.

For those who frequently enjoy Starbucks beverages, investing in Starbucks gift cards is a convenient way to merge the use of your Target gift card with your coffee cravings. Remember, while you can't directly use a Target gift card in Starbucks, being resourceful can enhance your shopping experience.

To sum up, the answer is clear: you cannot use a Target gift card at Starbucks. However, with a little creativity and some planning, you can still enjoy the benefits of both brands. Happy shopping!

Small disclaimer... my symptoms weren't the worst to begin with. I regularly had Globus and the occasional diarrhea but not as bad as some of our friends on here.

I'm not going to focus too much on the journey, but rather, the situation I'm in right now. Just like most of y'all, I went to my gastroenterologist several times and have undergone two rounds of triple.

Tums, Kremil-S, Erceflora, Mānuka Honey Tea, Aloe Vera Juice, all of it. My first round of triple (Panto-Amox-Clar) failed. **My second round (Panto-Amox-Levo) was a success!** I completed it on June 29th and tested negative on my Urea Breath Test on August 13th.

I didn't actually realize it but it was around October when I started feeling better (I took Fexuprazan/Fexuclue for two weeks around this time). All of a sudden, the mental battle was bigger than the physical one. By November, I no longer had Globus and nausea!

I started incorporating some things back into my diet. Some spicy food, some coffee, a sip of beer here and there. Around the holidays, I was in full swing. I could eat ANYTHING. At first, just to test my limits (I still had to take a single antacid per week for precaution even without the symptoms). But later on, I actually got to enjoy my eating/drinking habits again without giving it much thought.

The reason I'm posting this now instead of back in December is that I wanted three clear months of absolute certainty that I am fully, undoubtedly HEALED. I can eat everything, I can overeat, I'm back to having three to four coffees per day (I should dial this back lowkey lol) and I even sleep on a full stomach - face down or on either side at times. I think my HP was completely isolated and didn't develop into something more permanent like GERD. I've read/heard nightmare stories about people getting a negative on their stool test/UBT but having more issues afterwards.

There's light at the end of the tunnel, my friends! Get rid of the damn bacteria first. Trust the process. Let it heal for a couple of months after the negative result. You'll get your old life back afterwards! Good Luck and Godspeed!",4,1740302079.0,HPylori,4,1.0,False

It took around 8 hours.

There was alot of doubting if its all worth it.

1iw606p,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1iw606p/weight_loss_while_postpartum_and_breastfeeding/,Weight loss while postpartum and breastfeeding,"I feel lost at what to do. I am 7 months postpartum and my body is just not the same as it used to be. I knew this would happen but a part of me thought if I wished hard enough it wouldn't happen to me. But I definitely have a mom pooch and stretch marks. I'm 28 years old and 133 lbs. I really should be 115-120 lbs. I'm 5 foot 3 inches tall.

3 years ago I did keto for about half a year and lost 37 lbs. I also cycled 6 days a week. It was amazing and I was addicted. Pretty much immediately after I got to my goal weight there was a loss in my family and it really impacted me and I stopped cycling and doing keto. It was devastating for my health and actually scary. Carbs shocked my body and I was having symptoms a type 2 diabetic would have. I didn't stay at 118 lbs for very long unfortunately and have since yearned to be that weight again and have a more toned body again.

Well fast forward to now, I do not like at all how I look. I body check myself in the mirror like 20 times a day feeling so icky in my body. I was 126 lbs right before pregnancy and 133 now. Not a huge difference, but where fat is distributed on my midsection just has me feeling so icky when I look in the mirror. I know life is more than how we look and I should have grace with myself (especially after creating the most beautiful human ever with my own body which is an absolute miracle and I'd never change a thing even if I could), but I think it's also fair to feel this way, right? Or is this in the territory of mental issues and body image issues? The stretch marks to me are not a deal breaker. I don't really like them but it's nothing that a coffee scrub won't fix. It's mostly just the pooch. Fat spilling of my pants. Even high waisted clothing. I still fit like a size xs or s but my fat is just... there.... bothering me. My 30 inch waist has me dying when my waist was 25 inches at 118 lbs.... Sometimes I think of myself as a bunch of numbers. Has me frustrated and obsessing sometimes.

Now, it's not so simple for me to just do keto, exercise, and do intermittent fasting like I know how to do. I've watched way too many Dr eric berg videos to forget that. My issue is that I am breastfeeding and that creates some challenges. I loooove breastfeeding and plan to do it as long as I can. Maybe a couple years. But this toxic part of my brain is telling me to wean my baby just so I can do all the weight loss stuff I want to do. Because I can't just casually start keto cold turkey. I can't fast under any circumstance. I can't exercise too much. All of these things can make lactation stop very quickly if I'm not too careful. Ugh.

I did not do keto just prior to or during my pregnancy. I really wish I would have done that.

So I'm wondering if anyone else has experience with this. Encouragement would be great too. Tips. Ideas. Anything... I'd just love to feel not so overwhelmed and scared to start. Not alone in this feeling.

I do think keeping extra hydrated is a MUST to prevent lactation stopping. Making sure I'm eating healthy meals and snacks that are filling and full of healthy fats. Also getting adequate sleep and lowering stress too is important. Walks would be good for that.",1,1740301163.0,keto,0,1.0,False

Stepping into your favorite local bar often means more than just a quick drink—it’s an experience. For stout lovers, the bar is a treasure trove of rich, full-bodied flavors waiting to be discovered. From the silky textures to the roasted malt profiles, stouts have carved a special niche in the world of beer. Today, we’re diving into a local bar’s guide to stout beer, highlighting some common and popular choices available on tap, with a special nod to the iconic Guinness.**The Rich History of Stout Beer**

Stout beer’s roots can be traced back to the 18th century in London, where it evolved from the popular porter style. Originally a term for strong porters, “stout” simply meant robust or hearty. As brewers experimented with darker malts and roasting techniques, the flavor profile shifted, giving rise to what we now recognize as the stout. Over the centuries, stout beer has become synonymous with depth and complexity—an evolution marked by the influence of Irish brewing traditions and the worldwide spread of the Guinness brand.

The historical significance of stouts is evident in every sip. These beers were once the drink of the working class, celebrated for their hearty character and ability to provide warmth and sustenance. Today, they have transcended their humble beginnings to become a refined beverage enjoyed by enthusiasts around the globe, a testament to their enduring appeal and rich legacy.

# How Stout Beer Is Created

The magic behind stout beer begins with a careful selection of ingredients and a time-honored brewing process. Here’s a glimpse into what makes a stout so distinct:

* **Malted Barley and Roasted Malts:** The foundation of any stout is malted barley, which is often roasted to a dark hue. This roasting process caramelizes the sugars and introduces flavors reminiscent of coffee, chocolate, and sometimes a hint of smokiness. The degree of roasting plays a crucial role in defining the stout’s intensity.
* **Hops and Yeast:** While hops provide balance by adding a slight bitterness to counteract the sweetness of the malt, yeast is the workhorse that ferments the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The fermentation process is usually carried out at cooler temperatures, allowing for a smooth and well-rounded flavor profile.
* **Water and Nitrogen:** Water quality is essential in brewing, affecting both taste and texture. Many stouts, particularly Guinness, are known for their creamy consistency, achieved by infusing the beer with nitrogen instead of carbon dioxide. This nitrogenation process creates smaller bubbles and a velvety mouthfeel, elevating the overall drinking experience.

From the selection of ingredients to the intricate steps of brewing and fermentation, every stage is a craft that has been refined over centuries. The result is a stout that not only delights the palate but also tells a story of tradition and innovation.

**The Timeless Appeal of Guinness**

No conversation about stout beer is complete without mentioning Guinness. This Irish dry stout has been delighting beer enthusiasts for over a century, and it continues to be a top pick in bars worldwide. What makes Guinness so special? It’s the perfect balance of roasted malt flavors with subtle hints of coffee and dark chocolate, crowned with a creamy, nitrogen-infused head that sets the stage for an unforgettable tasting experience.

When you pour a pint of Guinness, you’re not just witnessing a drink—you’re watching a ritual. The cascading effect as the beer settles, the velvety mouthfeel, and that bittersweet finish all contribute to an experience that feels both classic and comforting. Whether you’re unwinding after a long day or celebrating with friends, Guinness offers a timeless taste that has become synonymous with quality and heritage.

**Other Stout Stars on the Bar Menu**  
  
While Guinness often takes center stage, many local bars pride themselves on offering a diverse stout lineup that caters to all palates. Here are a few popular contenders you might come across:

Murphy’s Irish Stout -  
  
With a slightly sweeter profile and a smoother finish than Guinness, Murphy’s offers a softer entry point for those new to stouts. Its balanced taste makes it a favorite for those who enjoy a less bitter alternative without sacrificing depth.

Beamish Irish Stout -  
  
Often compared with its Irish counterparts, Beamish presents a robust flavor profile with a pronounced roasted character. Its rich, full-bodied taste is perfect for sipping slowly while enjoying hearty bar fare.

Crafted Imperial and Milk Stouts-  
  
Many bars now feature locally brewed stouts that range from intensely rich Imperial varieties to the creamier, dessert-like Milk Stouts. Each offers its unique twist on the classic stout experience, ensuring there’s something for everyone—from the adventurous palate to the traditionalist.

  
At your local bar, enjoying a stout is about more than just the liquid in your glass—it’s an invitation to savor the culture and history behind each brew. Whether you’re a seasoned stout aficionado or just beginning your journey into the world of dark beers, there’s an option waiting to delight your senses. The ambiance of a local bar, the camaraderie of fellow beer lovers, and the sheer pleasure of a well-crafted stout come together to create memorable moments, pint after pint.

1iw5rz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1iw5rz8/nmom_prioritized_her_birthday_party_over_me_and/,"NMom prioritized her birthday party over me and left me alone in the ER without even saying goodbye after suffering, a concussion and possible hip and spine fracture","I don’t even know where to begin, but today has been one of the most painful and emotionally draining experiences of my life, and I need to vent and share what happened. By the way, I don’t know if this matters, but I’m a 33-year-old female and used to post in here a lot. I am disabled emotionally and physically. 

This afternoon, I had a pretty serious fall. I was sitting in my Lazy Boy-style chair, and it tipped backward, throwing me onto the floor. I’m already dealing with severe osteoporosis, arthritis, and a hip labral tear, so falling like that could have easily led to fractures. But I couldn’t get up because of the pain and muscle weakness, and I had to crawl to my mom’s room screaming for help. It took her and her boyfriend over an hour and a half to call 911, despite me repeatedly telling them I was in pain and needed help. They had me sit on the floor, leaning against the wall, with a possible spine and hip fracture. her boyfriend kept telling me that 911 was for if you’re like bleeding or whatever so they were just sitting there freaking calling volunteer places that didn’t answer and my mom was like. ""Do you want coffee"" to him and started making him coffee.

Eventually, paramedics came, and they thought I might have fractured my spine or hip, but after some tests, they told me there were no fractures. I still have severe muscle contusions, and the pain is getting worse. I’m also dealing with a concussion—feeling dizzy, nauseous, and just not right. It’s been hours now, and I feel completely invalidated.

After I got home, she was focused on her birthday party. She texted me later saying, “I’m sad you won’t be at my party, but I understand.” She completely downplayed the seriousness of my injury and acted like it wasn’t a big deal. When I called her out on it, she lied about what the doctors said regarding a treadmill because her and her best friend, my doctor’s nurse keep telling me a treadmill with incline won’t help my bone disease, (she claimed nurses said it wouldn’t help, but they actually said the opposite). She tried to deflect and make excuses, and when I pressed her about it, she suddenly had a “serious nosebleed” and stopped responding.

What hurt even more was that after everything, my mom left me in the hospital without even saying goodbye. When I reached out to her, she told me to stop texting her so much because I was bothering her. She mentioned she had things to do on a Saturday—like getting ready for her birthday party, which was the day before all of this happened. I felt completely abandoned in a serious situation, and I can’t shake that feeling.

And then her partner defended her! He told me I shouldn’t be so hard on her because “she was going to come back.” He didn’t seem to care that I was literally in pain and struggling. It was like my health and well-being didn’t matter at all.

Also, a quick update—so I just talked to my best friend (who, by the way, is the person I used to consider my best friend) and told him about everything, including the concussion. His response? “Oh, well it’s not a bad concussion, they wouldn’t have let you leave if it was that bad. See, I was right, you were fine.” Like, what?? I’m not fine. I’m not fine at all. But it seems like no one really cares to acknowledge that. I’m just so done with people minimizing my pain.

I feel completely alone in this. She’s been so focused on her own needs, and he just defends her behavior instead of acknowledging the emotional neglect and the fact that I was left to suffer. I feel like I’m invisible, and my pain is being brushed off.

Has anyone else been through something like this? It’s hard to reconcile the fact that she’s my mother and still does this to me. I’m just tired of feeling like my needs don’t matter. And am I overreacting? I mean, this was actually super short and non-detailed version.

TL;DR: Had a serious fall today, almost fractured spine/hip (Have severe Osteoporosis) no fractures found, but dealing with severe muscle contusions and a concussion. My mom and her boyfriend sat with me for an hour and a half without calling 911, and after I got home, my mom was too busy prepping for her party to check in on me. She also left me alone in the hospital, told me to stop texting her, and focused on her own plans. My best friend dismissed the concussion, saying I was fine. Just feel like no one cares and alone.

My name is Alex, and I work as a freelance graphic designer. I’ve always been a skeptic when it comes to the supernatural. I don’t believe in ghosts, demons, or any of those urban legends that pop up on creepy forums. I like routine. I wake up, make coffee, put on a playlist of indie rock, and start my workday. The scariest thing in my life was missing a deadline—until last night.

It started as a joke. My best friend, Josh, was really into online horror stories. He’d always send me links to weird forums or obscure YouTube videos, hoping to freak me out. We had this ongoing bet—if he could actually scare me, I’d buy him dinner at his favorite overpriced sushi place. He was the one who first told me about Blind Maiden. A website that supposedly only appears under specific conditions: at exactly midnight, on a new moon, alone, and in complete darkness. It was said to offer an experience of ""ultimate horror."" The legend claimed that those who clicked the ""accept"" button would never be seen again, their photos joining a gallery of eyeless, terrified victims.

Of course, I didn’t believe it. No one had ever proven the site was real, just a handful of anonymous users swearing they knew someone who knew someone who had vanished. A classic creepypasta. But the idea gnawed at me.

Last night was a new moon. My roommate, Eric, was out of town on a business trip, so I had the apartment to myself. It was the perfect opportunity to prove it was all nonsense. I even messaged Josh, joking that I was finally going to debunk his favorite horror myth. He just sent back a laughing emoji and told me to have fun.

So, like an idiot, I prepared everything: shut off every light, locked my doors, and at exactly 11:59 PM, I sat down in front of my laptop with a cup of cold coffee beside me. I was already exhausted from a long day of deadlines, but curiosity kept me awake. I remember thinking about my sister, Emily, and how she used to be terrified of horror movies when we were kids. I’d always tell her it was just special effects, that fear was just an illusion. Last night, I wished I still believed that.

When the clock struck midnight, I typed “Blindmaiden.com” into my browser.

It didn’t load. The screen stayed black for several seconds. I almost laughed. Typical internet hoax.

Then, the screen flickered.

A loading bar appeared. My breath caught in my throat.

Then—static. It was so loud it made me jump. And then, the images started.

Picture after picture flashed before me. Faces contorted in agony. Hollow sockets where eyes should have been. Every face frozen in pure terror. They looked real. Too real. My stomach turned. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t.

Then, text appeared:

**This website will take you to a whole new level of horror.**

**A horror that will use all five of your senses.**

**You must be very careful not to click on anything by accident.**

**You will be faced with a real experience of absolute horror.**

**Click the accept button to engage actively in the experience.**

**ACCEPT**

**DECLINE**

My hand hovered over the mouse. I should have exited right then. I should have shut my laptop and turned on every light in my apartment. But I was curious. Stupidly, fatally curious.

I clicked **accept.**

For a few seconds, nothing happened.

Then, my screen changed.

A dark street appeared. The camera angle shifted slightly as if someone—something—was moving. It was a live feed. I realized with growing dread that the street looked familiar. Too familiar.

It was my street.

The camera moved slowly but deliberately. House after house passed. Then, my apartment building came into view. My hands went clammy. The camera feed climbed the stairs. I heard each step creak through my speakers. My heart was pounding so loudly I thought I’d pass out.

The camera reached my door.

A single knock echoed through my apartment.

I screamed and spun around, but there was no one there.

I turned back to the screen. The camera was inside now. The perspective shifted as it moved down my hallway. My bedroom door. My door. The handle twisted, the door creaked open.

On my screen, I saw the back of my own head.

I froze.

A shadow loomed behind me.

Something ice-cold tapped my shoulder.

I wanted to run, to scream, to do anything—but I was paralyzed.

Slowly, I turned my head.

I can’t describe what I saw. My mind refuses to process it. Eyes that weren’t eyes. A mouth that wasn’t a mouth. A face stretched in an impossible, grotesque grin.

My laptop screen turned to static. The last thing I remember was screaming.

I woke up on the floor this morning. My laptop was closed, my body sore. I stumbled to the bathroom, trying to convince myself it had all been some horrific nightmare.

Then I looked in the mirror.

My eyes were bloodshot, but that wasn’t the worst part. My reflection wasn’t moving. It was staring at me. Frozen. Mouth open in a silent scream.

And then... the reflection smiled.

I slammed the mirror shut, shaking. My laptop was still on my desk. I hesitated, then opened it.

The website was gone. No history of it. No cache, nothing.

I don’t know what happened last night. I don’t know if I’m safe.

But I keep seeing things out of the corner of my eye. Shadows that shouldn’t be there. My reflection… watching.

And when I checked my phone just now, I found a new picture in my gallery.

It’s me.

My eyes are missing.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1iw5koy,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1iw5koy/of_fuck_feelings/,Of Fuck Feelings,"Update - FAFO


There was no easy solution and it was all a game. He didn’t start his separation process, she doesn’t know about me. But he learned a FAFO lesson, we had coffee and I lost my shit with him. He was testing the waters to see if I actually felt the way I said I did. I was so angry, this could have all been avoided. It’s over and I have made a decision to never test these muddy waters again. 

First timer here, be kind. 

I (F) have a LDAP (M), we have been communicating after meeting in the wild at a work event, our meeting was electric and we haven’t looked back since. We have been together physically once since the initial meeting in the last 7 months. 

The second time I was in the country he lives in he had to travel for work … I was furious and broke it off … that lasted 24 hours, my feelings are intense. It took a few weeks for us to get back to a normal cadence after I tried to call it off. 

I’m seeing him in 3 weeks, he is being far more communicative than usual and I’m super excited. Well, he dropped a bit of a bomb shell this week.
He has caught insane feelings, wants to me leave SO and bring my daughter to live with him. He has apparently told his SO about me (not who I am apparently) and started his separation process. All of a sudden this excited meet up has turned into something far too serious and I am fighting the urge to run for the hills! 

I have no intention of leaving my SO and I made that clear from the start, I also made it clear that I would never ask him to leave because he has his own kids. 

How do I get this across to him without crushing his little heart? Or am I being naive to the fact that there is no easy solution to this?

ID: A drawing of Klavier and Apollo. They are sitting on a couch next to each other. In front of them is a coffee table covered in various open tubes of lipstick.  Klavier is holding a makeup mirror in his hand and is adjusting the lipstick on his lips with his finger. He is saying “We haven’t found ONE lipstick that’s KISS proof! You must be getting awfully BORED with this experiment!” Apollo is slumped downwards on the couch, looking dazed and happy. There are kiss marks all over his face.

1iw5jcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1iw5jcp/strategy_to_balanceprioritize_two_languages/,Strategy to balance/prioritize two languages,"I recently started learning Italian with Pimsleur (alongside other resources) and just completed Unit 2. My long-term goal is to finish all five Italian levels and eventually get a B2 certification. Luckily, my upper-intermediate French helps a lot!

However, I have a trip in six months to East Africa—Kilimanjaro, safari, Zanzibar—so I decided to pick up Swahili to make the most of my experience (and because it just seems fun). Now I’m trying to figure out a strategy to balance both languages effectively.

Doing two Pimsleur lessons a day, one for each language, is technically possible but feels unsustainable — consistency is king.

# My Current Plan:

* **Pause Italian Pimsleur** (for now)
* **Focus on Swahili** – One Pimsleur lesson per day
* **Anki Flashcards** – Keep reviewing both Italian and Swahili (vocab + sentences)
* **Passive Italian Exposure** – Listen to Coffee Break Italian instead of Pimsleur, since it’s lighter

# After Finishing Pimsleur Swahili (only one unit exists):

* Resume Italian Pimsleur
* Continue both Anki decks

# Before My Trip:

* Pause Italian again
* Review the last \~10 Swahili lessons

# After the Trip:

* Finish the Italian course
* Get an Italian tutor
* Work toward the B2 certification

Is it sensible? Have you ever tried learning two languages at once? Any insights or experiences on how to balance them effectively?",1,1740299154.0,languagelearning,1,0.67,False

I have a Sage/Breville barista express that was purchased back in 2021 (so it’s now out of warranty) and over the past 3months have had a leaking group head. Have already taken it 3 times for repairs to a local agent in Malta but they are practically useless and so far all they did is waste my money.

When the issue first occurred I purchased a gasket off of Amazon and replaced it but didn’t solve the issue. Then I took it to the agent and they tightened the group head and replaced the gasket again. After that didn’t-work, they said its the coffee puck, which as well didn’t work. 

Is there anywhere I can buy the whole grouphead? Anyone encountered this and managed to sort it out? Would really appreciate your help here!

I’ve just finished with a couple of meetings planned, thankfully a lot slower and easier than what it has been. Certainly a case of being overworked in recent times so I will take a lower key day! I have some leave planned and looking to travel, I would love to hear some suggestions of places to visit.


Anyways I’m happy to talk about most things but I love to be outdoors and to travel. I’m also really into sport, either playing or watching. I’m 6ft, blue eyed, athletic, and from the UK.

Happy to answer any questions you have about working at universities or if you just want a general chat! ",2,1740298368.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I am 19, 230 pounds and only 5’8. I just simply don’t feel happy looking at myself seeing how fat I am and I want to be able to change that and not keep moping about it

——————————————————————-

This is the stuff I truly need help with.

I want to lose weight relatively fast, not the 1 pound a week stuff, I want to know if due to how astronomically high my BMI is if it’s possible with calorie limitations and running and weight lifting if it’s possible to lose 5 pounds (of fat because I know weight lifting will add more weight in muscle) a week roughly at least till I get to 200 pounds (I expect it to start to slow as my weight gets lower, I’m not trying to harm myself and force the weight to continue rocketing down) 

My other part of this that pertains to my failed precious attempts to run and lift. When I lifted before, I don’t know how to determine what weight I should use because I have a system for how I lift that my step dad who used to be a personal trainer taught me and it works well, problem is, I don’t know what weight to use. Usually, I can power through on heavy weights but then I’m sore for a week and simply, that’s not a way that is efficient for working out. The system I do is 12 reps low weight, 10 2.5 pounds higher, 8 2.5 pounds higher, 6 2.5 pounds higher, then end on 12 with the weight I used for either 10 or 8 depending on how I’m feeling. But like I said, I don’t know how to determine what weight I should be doing in order to not be sore for a week but still having it challenging enough to feel like I’m doing something. 

For running, I just use the C25K app which is simple enough and I have no issues with that.

——————————————————————————

Diet is important I think as well so it’s here.

For diet, I struggle to see if I’m eating enough without over eating, I go to school and work at night and so when I get home, usually I just eat frozen leftovers for dinner and that’s about it, maybe a carrot or apple or something later in the night if I’m feeling hungry. Usually I drink maybe 2-3 cups of coffee a day I’d say roughly, 2 at work, 1 at home. Work I usually do 4 sugars 3 creams for the second one and just a black coffee at the start when I arrive. When I get home I have a coffee with some 0 calorie creamer and do whatever I have to do from there.",2,1740298292.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.75,False
