1gnl5tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gnl5tj/bintangero/,Bintangero,"May ex ako, i think madaming nakabasa dito nung unang post ko about sa  minamaliit ako ng ex ko na graphic designer pero basic sa adobe &  head of web design pero di sanay mag code. 

Hiwalay na kami. Opo. Dahil aside sa kwentong yan, lagi nya na-overstep ang boundaries ko. 

It has been weeks since I went low contact. Email lang, para sa anak namin. All I do with my life right now is take care of our child, work, mag mall ng weekend or coffee with fellow mommies or ninangs ng anak ko. Walang ka-chat, walang kausap, walang dating app, nothing at all since Im not interested. 

Last Thursday, ang kuya ko ay dinala sa hospital. 
Friday, dumalaw ang daddy ng anak ko, nagpadeliver lang sya ng jobi para sa anak namin after eating, Maglalakad lakad lang daw sila sa labas ng bahay so sabi ko go lang kasi usually sa tapat lang sila. Nagulat ako dinala ang anak ko sa bahay ng nanay nya. Ok, hindi masamang dalhin ang anak ko sa lola nya. I have my deeper reason why ayaw ko dalhin nya anak namin ng wala ako. 1. Muntik makagat anak ko ng aso nung 14mos sya. (9 untrained dogs that wiwi/poops sa sofa, bed etc + 2cats) 2. Pusa nila ay tumate sa lababo kung san may hugasing plato. 3. Yun anak nya sa una, sa kapabayaan nya ay kamuntik masagasaan sa highway.  4. May jowa nanay nya na palaging lasing (iwas lang sa chances na ma-SA anak ko. Sorry not sorry) 

Dinala anak ko ng walang pasabi. Ofc, galit ako. Blocked him sa lahat. Di ko napansin, di pa sa IG. Nagchat ang ex ko na pinababayaan ko raw sa nanay ko ang anak namin like im neglecting our child. NO. Galing akong ospital, na-ICU kapatid ko, thank God he‚Äôs ok now. So I visited and offered pumalit muna sa SIL ko. I didnt reply, just blocked him. Ang toxic na sabihan akong im having fun without out child, neglecting our child, pabayang ina. Also him telling me na ‚Äúmahal nya ko at walang iba‚Äù when I just caught him 3mos ago chatting with another woman, sending her sa of our convo na putol putol (manipulated sa gusto lang ipabasa) nung nahuli ko? Siya pa galit kasi daw, ininvade ko privacy niya üòÜ

Ugh!! How to deal with this kind of person?! Gusto ko lang maging civil at kalmado. Ang gusto ko lang sana eh healthy co-parenting without him overstepping my boundaries. 

Bumitaw na ko kasi ang bigat bigat na. Kahit pa hangad ko buong pamilya para sa anak natin. Hindi na tama na buo pamilya natin pero ako wasak na. Anak natin mawawasak din dahil sa toxicity natin. 

Pagod na ko at hindi na ikaw ang pahinga ko.

1gnl4om,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1gnl4om/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art.

1gnl4gd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1gnl4gd/28f_germany/,"28F, Germany","Hi :)

Please find some photos of me below. I would be happy to share more during our conversation and would appreciate if you could do the same. For reference, I am 167 cm tall and currently weigh 75 kg. I am on a weight-loss journey and have lost around 12 kg since May. I am not sure what my final goal will be, as I have noticed that being too thin does not suit me. Mostly, I am focused on being healthy and looking my best.

**About me:**

I have a bachelor‚Äôs in Law and moved from Mozambique to Germany last year for a master‚Äôs programme. I am currently working as a research assistant and still deciding whether to pursue a PhD, another bachelors or find a job in my field.

I am an introvert, so indoor activities are my go-to. I enjoy learning new things‚Ä¶ random things, like why black mambas are called black if they are not actually black. I am trying to get better at chess, crochet every now and then, and like baking (though‚Ä¶ let us just say, not everything turns out Instagram-worthy! ;)). But I am not against outdoor activities. I push myself to go on hikes sometimes, although my fitness level could use some work (my last hike left me sore for a week!). Going out for dinner, coffee, ice cream, or a movie is definitely fine by me now and then. Bars, loud spaces, or super crowded places are not my thing. I speak Portuguese and English (and am still learning German). I do not drink alcoholic beverages. I have tried them and occasionally use them in cooking, but pure alcohol is not for me. I do not smoke, and I never have.

**My faith:**

I did not grow up in a Christian household, but one of my sisters would sometimes take me to her non-denominational church during my teenage years. She introduced me to Christianity, and I will always be grateful for that. But I did not fully understand salvation back then. Things changed when I was around 20 or 21, and I joined a church (Assembly of God). I learned the true Gospel, got baptised (for the second time), and even became a Sunday school teacher for children aged 4 or 5. However, I eventually struggled to continue, especially as I have battled depression my whole life. Some experiences and thoughts led me to believe that, as a Christian, I should not face those struggles. Some people at church even implied this, leading me to doubt my faith and stop attending.

A lot has happened since then, and I would be happy to share more if we talk. Right now, I am still trying to find my way back to being committed to a church. I have been attending Sunday services but am not involved in anything - a situation I hope to change soon. So far, I have visited a few churches near where I live, and I have been attending a Baptist church more regularly. I am considering staying as I have found a very loving community.

**A bit more about me:**

I have been in a few relationships before, but I have never been married and do not have children. I am open to if God blesses us with them. My past relationships mostly did not work due to what I can best describe as my tendency toward an avoidant personality. I wanted to be in a relationship but also felt I did not need it. Healing from childhood trauma was a part of this, as it often made me feel unworthy of being loved or too hard to love. This made me develop a certain sense of independence, not relying on anyone, pushing everyone away, and closing myself off. My thoughts were my worst enemy, so I would choose singleness. For a long time, I thought I should do life all alone (even without friends) despite God‚Äôs clear message that it is not good for us to be alone. As it is written, 'two are better than one‚Ä¶ if either falls, one can help the other up.'

Now, am I 'cured'? I really cannot say. So, how do I know the patterns are gone? Honestly, I do not entirely know. The only difference between me and the person I was about three years ago since my last relationship is that I am more aware and more willing to not let it interfere in a relationship. I am still healing, and I used to tell myself I should not date until I am 'fixed.' The truth is, if I waited until I was fully healed, I might remain single forever. I do not doubt God's ability to change me, but I also understand this might take its time. I understand that this might be a huge deal breaker, as no one wants an emotionally unavailable partner or spouse. I still, however, prefer to be upfront about where I am now and take full responsibility for it. I would only ask for your patience. Perhaps I could say I am looking for a Frodo-Sam type of bond (if you have watched *The Lord of the Rings*). You may not be able to lift my burdens, but you can support me while I do it, and I would gladly do the same for you.

**About you:**

I am not looking for any specific 'type' of person. Honestly, I do not even know if I have a type. Physically, as long as you take good care of yourself - no need to be a gym rat or run every marathon. I am not either. If you are, I would have no problem trying some of those activities so that we can share more experiences together. Either way, the goal is to grow old together without worrying about preventable health issues. I have not always been this mindful, but I am working to change.

In terms of personality, it would be nice if you lean more toward the extroverted side, just to balance things out a bit. But it is not a dealbreaker. Beyond that, I think anyone can be interesting in their own way. We can talk and see if there is a connection.

As for your faith, if you are in this sub, I am assuming you are a true believer, so I will not list core Christian values (like having to specify that I want lemonade made with lemons!). Maybe being also a protestant. My faith is important to me, and I am working on growing in it and pursuing sanctification, so I expect the same from you. You do not have to be a 'perfect' Christian - I am not, and I still have my thorns in the flesh and struggles - as long as you are committed to improving. I agree with those who say it is more about progress than perfection. At the same time, I hope you are not using that as an excuse to be lazy in your faith, as Christ calls us to grow in faith and knowledge of Him, not to remain infants in faith indefinitely.

**Age range:**

28‚Äì38. I do not think I would be comfortable dating anyone younger than me. *Slightly* older than 38, maybe.

**LDR / Relocation:**

I am open to a long distance relationship, depending on how far apart we are and how soon we could meet, as I would prefer to have a few in-person dates before officially dating. I believe LDR can work for a while, if both are committed and make an effort to communicate well. I am also open to relocating.

I'm pretty much noob if comes to code. But I'm really passionate abd learn quickly.

I hope to find your help here with my very first project, which I believe will allow me to then skyrocket with any other similar ideas. 

I'd rather found somebody here, in one place, instead of jumping between different forums and articles, who will hold my hand and guide me through fear and darkness. ü§£

I have administrative experience with Linux so I'm ok to instal Pi OS, use bash commands, but that would be it. I researched as much as I could of ""how to"" make it done like I have found the guide how to connect the speaker with an audio booster and volume jog, usb charge/discharge controller, but I still miss of how:

1. Connect spi display (I cannot attach picture here but it has it's breakout board with 8pins and fpc ribbon connector which I'd ideally prefer to use (and wire it to board through an adapter, as I need to cut that board on top/bottom to fit my project). I see multiple example and diagrams with screen pins meaning and where these should go on pi, but code the screen will obviously be a trouble. 

2.  Connect temp/humidity sensor and code it.

3. Boot always with screen that display clock, sensor reading and custom background wallpaper ( make a script file I guess) and then switch button to:

First click > switch from that screen to first MP4 video (scaled down to screen resolution), pressed second time to switch to slideshow with music (or I'll make it another mp4 for ease), and then if pressed the third time to go back to the screen with sensor reading.

Nice three steps loop triggered by button presses.

I'm hoping it'd inspire other people with ideas to try the car living as others have done for me.,"Cpl years ago when I was working at burlington I stumbled upon this community and I thought it was very interesting. I'd scroll thru my phone and look at the pictures of other peoples build and the reality of the living situation here in America(high cost of living, rent,food,etc). I started off simple with a jackery 300 and a 100 watt solar panel at my parents house trying to help off set my own use of energy. Slowly but surely I tried ""sleeping positions"" in my Toyota celica 04. I'd see pictures of people in vans, mid sized cars, turning their backseat into a bed so I did that. I ripped out the backseat and the passenger seat in my car then I built some weird platform with 2x4's and left over osb planks from homedepot along with foam matting from amazon n upholstered some linen on it as a bed. I'm short about 5'6 and but it was perfect  because I could sit cross legged on it without hitting my head and lay down in it with maybe a few inches to spare towards the trunk of the car. I ended up leaving burlington cause there was no work hours and used the last bit of my money to buy an extra 100watt solar panel. Then I started working at walmart last year doing frozen and diary for about 4 months .. my routine would was waking  up at 4am>gym>work>5pm eat>gym>sleep down the road from gym or at a parking structure close by.. It was so boring in my car when I had no work and halfway through I figured having a computer or monitor to watch netflix / youtube was essential so I rigged one up. The problem though was a 300 watt battery couldn't handle much and it'd charge to full while the sun was still out.

Back then my main devices I used were : Mini Rice cooker (once every 2 days), Mini Fridge (on during the day, off while sleeping), Water heater(for coffee obviously haha), Charging my phone/walmart phone, hockeypuck lights and a water pump. A couple months ago I ended up buying a 12v 100ah battery that was on sale and saw a video on youtube of a guy connecting a lithium battery to a solar generator(which is then used as the inverter).. Tried it and worked like a charm I could soak up more energy even when my station is full and I didn't have to save for those super expensive ones.

I wish I took more screenshots when I first started out to watch it evolve but the first pic had already 2 solar panels but I could only use the monitor/mini computer i attached to the back of it for 2hrs max because I needed the watts for the next day to cook food. Rest of the pics are recent. I had to redo the configuration on the solar charger for it to fit in the bucket seat of my celica without the wires fallin off. With the additional battery the two mini fridges can run 24/7, am able to use my mini griddle 3x a day(6-7mins), charge phone multiple times, Rice cooker 1x a day, cook hard boiled eggs and still have left over power to watch netflix. If  you are car living full time, part-time, or camping in a car for fun trust me it's possible in a small interior vehicle and my goal is that whoever out there reading this give it a try; you never know where things go in this economy and having a backup plan is better than none. Ive been kicked outta my home twice, lost my job twice, if it weren't for my curiosity of car dwelling and subreddit I'd be slowly collecting debt for hotels or being a burden to other friends and family

My plants are dying.
They wither away before me,
and I watch them shrinking in the shame of my neglect.
My plants are dying.

Each day that goes by, the soil sinks in on itself‚Äî
a painful reminder.
Too little, too late.
A reflection of my mental state.
They ask for water, for light,
for more than I can give,
for what little will or energy I have left.
My plants are dying.

Around me they curl inward,
the edges of each leaf bruised by my hunger,
my hands that cannot feed.
We‚Äôre both starving, slowly,
wilting in a shared silence.
My plants are dying.

If only I could water myself, I think,
looking at the pile of dishes that overflows my sink.
Each unwashed cup a reminder,
a weight that keeps me from reaching,
from feeding myself, from saving them.
My plants are dying.

When they finally reach the faucet,
the water overcomes them‚Äîa flood too late.
Some leaves yellow, some roots shrink back,
as if even care is now too heavy, too sudden.
And I understand the toll, the price they pay for drought and thirst,
just as I pay, caught in another kind of hunger,
where even the smallest drop is a shock to the system,
and nourishment itself becomes something to survive.
My plants are dying.

These plants that I nurtured,
each one a fragile promise and
I can‚Äôt seem to bring them back.
Pill after pill and drop after drop,
I scramble to keep us both alive,
and it breaks me to watch them wither.
Only I am responsible for our demise.
My plants are dying.

Yet somehow, a few leaves still reach toward the light,
thin-stemmed but stubborn.
They remind me that even in drought, they search for life.
And maybe‚ÄîI, too, can find a way to reach,
to lean into the light, to soak up whatever I can.
Perhaps, tomorrow, I‚Äôll find the strength to nourish us both.

I will be vague at points because I do not want to be possibly identified. I went to a shop this morning to get some breakfast. As I walked in, there was this older man sitting alone in a corner table. He shouted something inaudible, but I didn't think much of it. I placed my order and as I was waiting to be charged, this man stood up and walked by me to throw away his empty coffee cup. On his way back, he stopped right in front of me and grabbed onto my forearm. I figured that maybe he needed help staying upright as he walked with sort of a hitch, it seemed innocent. Then I noticed him squeezing harder, and I started to feel a bit uneasy. He started rubbing my forearm up and down for what felt like an eternity. I wasn't sure what to do in that situation, I felt frozen and nothing like that had ever happened to me before. Eventually I found my voice and I told him to stop touching me, to which he got upset, but didn't immediately stop. Finally, he let go, walked behind me where he stood for about half a minute, and ultimately walked away. I don't know what to make of this. I am a man, and this was another adult man. I told my family what happened as soon as I returned home, but everyone reacted the same way, by laughing and joking about it. To me it feels dismissive, and deep down I was honestly hurt, but I keep thinking to myself that I'm being ridiculous for dwelling on someone touching my arm. But I can't help but feel dirty, I can't stop thinking about it, and I just feel like less of a person. I'm ashamed, partly because of what happened, but also because of how it's making me feel now. I don't know what to label my experience, I don't know how to bring it up with people close to me so that they take me seriously, and I don't know how to find peace in my mind right now.

I continue my work day on phone calls, getting the apartment ready,etc.

I‚Äôve contributed it mostly to my autism, gender ambiguity, and the fact that I live in a rural area. Slim pickings, y‚Äôknow? I‚Äôm also queer and Native American (aanishinaabe), and both of my parents are left leaning. You could understand why it would be hard to find a partner in my area. 

     About two weeks ago, I downloaded Tinder, mainly as an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù type-thing, and somewhat as a joke. I didn‚Äôt expect much to come from it, and while I found a couple familiar faces, one stuck out to me. A guy I went to highschool with. From what I could remember, he seemed nice enough. We sat together at prom, at the table all the misfits gravitated to, and I remembered him vaguely from that night. So I swiped right. 

     I put the phone down for a couple hours, and my heart dropped as I picked it up again. A message from him. We talked, and ended up scheduling a date for the following week. Over the course of the week, my feelings had shifted and changed from excited, to nervous, to upset, to excited again.

       Now the date‚Ä¶ this is where it gets interesting. We meet at a chain cafe and he buys me a coffee, then asks what I want to do. We decide to drive around for a bit. It was dark out, and the weather was beautiful, so it was perfect. Until he said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mind my driving.‚Äù I laughed a bit, and told him that my dads a shitty driver so I‚Äôm used to it. He laughed back. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm a good driver, I just drive fast.‚Äù With no time to brace, he whips around a corner and hauls ass down the road. We reach 120 k/hr (74.5 mph). Thats when I started regretting the night out. A year ago I lost a friend to a car accident and ever since, the possibility of car fatalities has rung as both real and terrifying. He bragged all night about how fast he drives, how he likes to scare his friends by going fast. Then we reached 140k/hr. 

     To my (very thankful) surprise, we pulled into a small burrito place after he told me he wasnt able to eat lunch during his 8hr work shift. I wasn‚Äôt hungry, but told him I have no problem with him eating, and that I‚Äôd rather him eat than stay hungry. As we sat in his car, he put on some music and we began to talk about our music tastes. We started out agreeing on things like Limp Bizkit, Pearl Jam, etc. Until he said ‚ÄúOHH this ones good. It might be the A.I version hold on.‚Äù and played a song called ‚ÄúIllegals In My Yard‚Äù remember, I‚Äôm Indigenous‚Ä¶ and tend to do lots of research on the colonization of North America. So when he sat and explained to me how funny the song is and played the entire thing‚Ä¶ I was baffled. He continued to go on and on about how he hates PC culture and yada yada‚Ä¶

       After he ate, we walked around town for a bit, and he proceeded to tell me all about his values, his interests, and when we weren‚Äôt going on about him, it was silence. Awkward silence. The kind that lurks in still air. At one point he looked at his watch and said ‚ÄúWe still got an hour to kill and weve gone everywhere.‚Äù After that long hour, he offered to drive me home, but I declined. 

     I got home and told my friends about it and they opened my eyes to the red flags I was previously blind to. Thank god they did. The next day, he texted me saying ‚Äúi think we both had a good time last night, when do you want to do it again?‚Äù and here is where I may be the asshole. I ignored him. Its been a few days, and I‚Äôve yet to say anything. Considering I have no actual attachment to him and it was only one date, I don‚Äôt feel like I exactly owe him much, and I don‚Äôt exactly want to talk to him.

I've had werewolves on the brain lately and forgot to put on my wedding ring before nipping over to the local hipster grocery.  Apparently, the universe got confused and gave me the paranormal-inspired meet cute it clearly intended for one of you.

Here I am, kitted out in my frumpiest weekend clothes, hair barely brushed, trying to rub circulation into my freezing hands while lurking in front of the refrigerated meats.  There's only one box of the store's secret recipe meatballs remaining (pretty sure the ingredients are red meat and crack), so I go for it -- totally failing to notice the large man standing *right there*, doing the *exact same thing*.

There was no gentle bump of hands, no delicate fumble, no shy glances.  No, my friends, I full-on grabbed this man's gigantic hand in my raccoon paw as he grabbed the meatballs.  

He froze.  I froze.  My lizard brain slowly rebooted. I let him go.

""Do you want these?"" he asked. 

I don't usually check people out, but this man was astonishingly tall and broad-shouldered, with Joe Manganiello's features and swooped hair circa 2010.  Between the stubble and red flannel, he might as well have been Joe's werewolf character from True Blood.

Unexpected perk to being happily married: Something about this man's *ridiculous* good looks was hilarious enough to break the inevitable shame spiral.  I laughed, apologized, awkwardly joked that he could keep his balls, apologized for the joke, and wandered off to the wine section.

This story should be over, but the universe had already gambled its good romantic karma for the day and apparently decided to go all in. 

Fast forward a few minutes: I've loaded six bottles of wine and zero food into my basket, so it's time to visit the specialty junk food aisle. Because that'll provide the inspiration I need to plan tomorrow's dinner. 

Werewolf Joe approaches me next to all the fancy chocolate, and says something to the general effect of: ""I noticed your hands were ice cold. Maybe you could get warmed up if I bought you a coffee at the Starbucks across the street.""

Skipping over the part where I asked him to repeat himself and then clarified that he was hitting on me (""I'm trying to,"" he said)... I proceeded to gesture to my *basket full of wine* with my *ringless, too-pale-for-tanlines* hand, and say I have to get home to make dinner for my husband. (It is also noon.)

Werewolf Joe took this like a champ; we had a good laugh, I thanked him for the flattery, and we parted ways at checkout. I still have no food.  I failed all of my single friends by forgetting to ask his number, but there's a handsome, presumably single potential-shifter wandering around Northeast Ohio in search of a messy woman! 

Anyway, I thought someone else might get a laugh, some real life hope, or some kink inspiration from the universe's mishap. In the spirit of the day, please also feel free to share your favorite paranormal meet cutes!",49,1731187936.0,fantasyromance,6,0.96,False

37F. The situation is difficult to talk about with my friends and family because those close to me get emotional and try to comfort me when the topic comes up. I‚Äôm hoping you all will be less emotional and a bit more objective.

I‚Äôm a wife and mom of three (8M, 6F, and 3F). A few months ago, I noticed something was bothering my middle child. She was having outbursts, didn‚Äôt want to go to school, and seemed sad and afraid. I kept pressing her, and eventually, I learned that a much older boy at her school (he was in seventh grade) sexually assaulted her twice at after school care. I won‚Äôt describe it because it‚Äôs very upsetting, but it was incredibly serious and traumatic.

As you can probably imagine, my husband and I are absolutely devastated. We immediately contacted the school and police, sent our kids to another Catholic school in the area, and got our daughter into therapy. I also made the difficult decision to take time off work to be there for my daughter while she heals from this.

My daughter is doing a lot better, but is still having a hard time. She wants to be near me as much as possible, sleeps with us or her older brother every night, and seems very nervous and skittish around older boys and men she doesn‚Äôt know well. 

Luckily, our friends and family have been very supportive of us and our daughter. I think everyone means well, but people have a lot of opinions about how we should handle things. Especially my mother-in-law. 

Yesterday morning, my MIL invited me over for coffee. We don‚Äôt typically do things one-on-one, so I was a bit surprised. My MIL told me that she loves me and that I clearly love my daughter so much, but I might be getting bad advice.

She proceeded to tell me that one of her friends is a psychologist. When his daughter was a little girl, she was molested by a babysitter. When his wife asked what they should do, he said nothing. They told the kid that the things she and the babysitter did were for adults and that she should tell them if someone ever tried to do something like that to her again. They didn‚Äôt make a huge deal about it, send her to therapy, or show her they were upset. Apparently, the psychologist thinks that these events aren‚Äôt traumatic for kids until adults start making a huge deal about it and treating them differently.  He thinks most therapists have it wrong by making kids and their families talk about it constantly and relive the events. My MIL proceeded to tell me that the child is now an attorney and she remembers the event, but doesn‚Äôt view it as a scary or defining thing because her family didn‚Äôt turn it into one. 

My MIL said we‚Äôre making this a defining event for our daughter by being so emotional about it, sending her to therapy, and coddling her. She says my daughter has always been a confident little girl, and now she seems nervous and unsure of herself. My MIL says she might think we see her differently because of what happened.

I‚Äôll preface this by saying that I really think my MIL had the best of intentions by raising this with me. I know she loves our little girl, and truly wants what‚Äôs best for her. With that being said, I think she‚Äôs misinformed. It‚Äôs hard for me to know for sure, since I don‚Äôt have a background in psychology, but her approach is pretty much the exact opposite of what my daughter‚Äôs pediatrician and therapist have said for us to do.

I told my MIL that I‚Äôm going to continue sending my child to therapy, and she asked if I‚Äôd at least call her friend and chat with him. She said therapists have an incentive to say that talking about the assault is a good thing, but her friend is coming at it from an unbiased perspective. I told my MIL I appreciated it, but I‚Äôve spoken to several people, and I feel good about the approach we‚Äôre taking.

My MIL said there‚Äôs no harm in getting an additional perspective, and begged me to at least talk to the guy. She said I must know she has a point, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be so resistant to hearing another point of view. I explained that I already have a lot on my plate, feel great about the decisions we‚Äôre making, and don‚Äôt need someone else giving their two cents. 

My MIL was pretty upset when I left, and accused me of being stubborn and thinking I know better than a psychologist. I told my MIL I‚Äôd like to see her friend‚Äôs credentials, considering what he‚Äôs saying seems to go against what every other professional we‚Äôve spoken to says to do. I left pretty shortly after that, and we haven‚Äôt spoken to her since.

My husband is also suspicious of the advice, but doesn‚Äôt see the harm in at least talking to the guy. Personally, I think it sounds crazy, and don‚Äôt see the point. AITAH?",3,1731187864.0,AITAH,6,0.8,False

1gnkewb,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gnkewb/gaggia_anima_prestige_no_beans_error_a_fix_and_a/,Gaggia Anima Prestige No Beans error... A fix and a workaround ,"So the Anima Prestige is a pretty great machine and there are a lot of things to like about it, such as value for the price and just classic Gaggia history (though now this one is basically a Saeco... but I digress).

But I've been getting caught by a problem that, it seems, a lot of Gaggia Anima Prestige folks discover sooner or later: the **Beans Out error**. It shows up as a red screen with a slash through a bean, interrupting the brewing cycle just after the grind. You get a slushy pod leftover of slightly damp coffee you have to throw away, and a thin dribble of sludge out of the the spout.

Now folks at various [forums](https://www.coffeeforums.co.uk/threads/gaggia-anima-prestige-false-no-beans-error.51540/) think they figured out the problem, that the grinder looks for a certain amount of voltage to keep a steady speed and a chip monitors it.  If oily beans are in there, the grinder has to work harder (pulling higher voltage). And for less oily,  it has to work less hard, lower voltage. And if no beans are in the grinder, it works so easily that a limit is tripped (voltage too low) and it says No Beans.

It seems that the ""AI"" (Gaggia's phrase) in the machine learns a range of acceptable values from the grinds you've experienced. But if you use oily beans too often, the machine learns the wrong limits, and *there's no way to reset them*!  And so you'll continue to blow through beans, even at the machine complains ""No Beans!"".  Forum folks thought about adding a resistor to change the voltage pull, but here are some alternatives.

So, the **Fix**: the [Whole Latte Love Service Dept](https://support.wholelattelove.com/hc/en-us) said I could send in my power board (or the whole machine) and they can ""update the firmware"" to remove the error; they have a [good video](https://support.wholelattelove.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411133685523--Gaggia-Anima-Replace-the-Power-Board) on how to remove and replace the power board (yes, you have to take apart much of the machine).  Time and money to ship, but should fix the problem.  I bought the machine from them, but I suspect they would charge the same (I didn't ask, once I heard I had to take apart the machine) to anyone who has one with this delightful problem.   

The Workaround: the forums that figured out the voltage issue also figured out the workaround.  **Simply lift and drop the bean lid during the grind**.  Due to a magnetic sensor, this action stops the grinder for a sec, confusing the voltage tracker, and so the grind completes, no ""No Beans"" error!  I've found 2 lift and drops works every time across the 8-10 sec grind cycle, 2-3 sec apart, while just 1 is hit or miss.  I don't love this method, but it's easy and seems to work.

So, if you are getting the ""No Beans"" error after almost every grind, and you are using dry beans, and you even cleaned the grinder out (Whole Latte has a [video on that](https://support.wholelattelove.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500002682841--Gaggia-Anima-No-Beans-Error-Grinder-Blocked-or-E01-Error-Code) (and tons of other [great topics](https://support.wholelattelove.com/hc/en-us/sections/360012583753-Gaggia-Anima)), well..

Either repair the power board through a trusted shop, or do the lift and drop and see what happens.

PS: great discovery that didn't fix the problem but made me happy anyway: Urnex Supergrindz is quite impressive (not the regular! the newer purple label!), a foodsafe set of ""fake beans"" that you let grind and get pressed, all safe, cleans out lots of crud and oils.  Don't use the regular, they expand under the pressure and break your machine!  But these new ones are easy and cool.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

It's really that good. I sat in a coffee shop holding back a tear because it made my heart twist in the most wonderful way... I was missing that twisting feeling in your gut when you want something really really bad. 

This book had pretty much everything right.. for me. The characters were relatable, they showed development. There was elegance, drama, romance, heartache, love, family, friends, everything I wanted. 

You know what it didn't have? A single moment where I didn't want to fly to the next page. I finished it in 1.5 days. And it only took that long because I physically stopped myself from finishing it sooner. 

The MMC and the FMC seemed like real people, who made realistic decisions. They supported each other, grew, and changed with each other. I can't wait to read it again and maybe I won't sob as I did the first time, I know it will still be beautiful.

I wanted to discuss our fledgling relationship over coffee but that possibility ended with a no contact decree. 

After asking you to spend more time with you outside of the physical therapy sessions I really couldn‚Äôt have another session with you as I felt that I exposed myself emotionally to you. 

This is the reason I ended the conversation as little as it was. 

Perhaps that isn‚Äôt a valid reason to you but my feelings for you will remain hidden until we sit across from each other with coffee in a new relationship not one where I was simply a client but you had a choice to make and I‚Äôm not sure what it was to my invitation? 

Stars and planets may align but no matter what signs and wonders appear one must choose to walk in them.

The problem my dear Horatio is that the problems lie not in the stars but in ourselves.

1gnjvz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gnjvz9/aitah_for_removing_myself_from_my_music_duo_with/,AITAH for removing myself from my music duo with my brother in law and refusing to discuss the conversation between him and I with my sister? ,"Throwaway account because I'm not sure if any of the people involved in this have their own accounts and I just need an outside opinion looking at the situation in its entirety. And apologies for the long post in advance- I guess I just want to make sure I'm not leaving out any details to the situation.

My (29F) brother in law (30M- we'll call him BIL) and I started an acoustic cover music duo together over the summer. This started when BIL was approached by his own sister if he would like to play guitar at the winery she works at because they were looking for new events to bring people in. He didn't want to perform alone, so he reached out to me because he knew that I sang. I didn't really think much of it- I thought we'd perform a handful of shows and that would be the end of it. At first, I was kind of excited because 1) I'm not super close with BIL (sister and I don't have the closest relationship either and don't get along very well) and I thought this was something fun to work on together, and 2)I hadn't done any public performances in quite some time and thought this would be a great creative outlet for me.

This is where we probably should have discussed the vision and future of this whole acoustic duo, but again, I really thought we'd only perform a handful of shows and that would be it (I guess this is where the saying ""if you assume something it makes an ass out of U and ME"" holds true). 

Before our first show, he already was scouring through Facebook Marketplace for sound equipment. I had expressed to him at this point that I didn't think it was necessary because we haven't even performed yet; I wanted to wait to see how things would go. Then he found a Fender amplifier 2 hours away for $200 that would allow us to plug his guitar and microphones into. ""It's a really good deal for this!"" I don't know ANYTHING about sound equipment, haven't done any research... but I don't know what else to do, so I say if he thinks it's worth it, I guess he can pick it up. He goes and picks up the amplifier. I feel obligated to chip in since I'm part of this,  so I pay for half of it, along with the cost of the mic stands, mics, and mic covers. He also bought a cheap tablet to read music from.

  
This is also where my sister (27F) started getting involved. In the group chat between my sister, BIL and myself-which was originally just a chat about anything and everything that we used to shoot the shit with each other- they started discussing band names that the two of them had generated in chatGPT. Having a background in art, she also created a logo for us to put on a poster and share with the venue, as well as on the mic stand so people could see who we were. She does not participate in the music activities, otherwise.

Our first show was underwhelming, to say the least. We performed okay. Our audience was our family members and the only tips we received were from them. On top of that, a customer that was entering the winery through the door we were set up by thought that he had been interrupting something (lol). I don't want to sound ungrateful by any means, you have to start somewhere! But I guess in that moment, I kind of felt like a little kid in the living room trying to put on a talent show for my parents. After this show, BIL asked me how I thought the show I told him exactly that. He blamed it on the fact that the winery was not advertising us, that the area they had us set up in was not ideal, etc. 

...Then the Facebook page launches... to start promoting our second show with the winery. Again, probably should have had a conversation about this whole thing at this point, but once they launched the Facebook page, it was kind of a grin-and-bear-it moment where I thought, ""I guess I'm here along for this ride"" as I had no involvement in creating the page. We have our second show, same results as the first. This venue is also an hour and 15 minute drive from where I live, so getting paid the $50 from the owner basically would cover gas and that was about it. We discussed how it went after and I had expressed the same thing again. He once again blamed the winery for not advertising our show. I honestly don't care, because I'm thinking we're only going to do a handful more and that will be the end of it. 

BIL starts this massive local venue search to find gigs for us and starts pushing me to do the same to the point where he required me to bring my laptop to one of our practices so he could check to make sure I was contacting venues. We don't have much luck- which, again, I honestly don't care. To me, this is a fun hobby where I get to do something I enjoy but possibly make a little money on the side. He's striking out with every venue he talks to. I come across this local Christmas tree farm where I live, mention it to him, and he kind of dismisses thinking they probably won't be interested, but I could try reaching out. I like to think my customer service background helps here-  I make an instant connection with the owners and they set up a meeting to discuss the possibility of live music with them. It would be their first season incorporating live music, and the owners are particular about who they bring into their community and business because they want good, wholesome, quality people. We don't even audition for them, it's a casual conversation in the owner's kitchen over some beers. Meeting goes well and we make a deal of $150/3 hr show we perform, 1-2 shows per weekend that their business is open from Thanksgiving to Christmas. I'm ecstatic to connect with these people in general and it's the only paid gig we have at this point. I get this weird sense that it bothers BIL that I found this business and set up this deal for us and he didn't. I can't explain why, all I can say is I can sense it. 

Eventually, BIL finds a local smoothie shop in his hometown and a seasonal festival going on one weekend.  Smoothie shop would not be able to pay us because they're nonprofit, but we can set out a tip jar. For some reason, my brother in law has this idea that we're going to make a ton of tips that will make up for the fact that we don't get paid. This show also happened to be the weekend AFTER my sister was due to give birth to their son. I said I was okay with it, but was more concerned about my sister and her thoughts on it. Sam also seemed somewhat hesitant- we both were gently trying to tell BIL it was possible for the baby to be born late, to which he responded, ""No,  I have a feeling that he's going to be born on time (What the actual fuck...?)."" I even messaged her privately if she was okay with it, and she told me that if they baby did deliver that week they could always cancel because performing for this venue was basically like community service (her words, not mine). 

My nephew was born three weeks early while my husband and I were on our honeymoon out of state. As soon as we return, we're exhausted from a less than ideal delay during our travel back, we're trying to catch up around the house, and I immediately jump into a program at work that requires me to not be on my phone. BIL reaches out in the chat with me and my sister, 3 days after my sister gives birth on the day we're supposed to technically practice: ""Hey! safe to say we're not practicing tonight. Would you be available this weekend? And you can also meet your nephew."" ...Maybe I took this the wrong way, but I didn't love that practice was being prioritized over meeting my nephew.  
  
  I previewed the message, but I'm so busy, overtired, and overstimulated I don't respond. The next day, he messages: ""Hi Amanda, please let me know what the plan is for the weekend."" My sister messages 3 hours later: ""Amanda, please let us know..."" My response: ""Hi! Husband and I would be happy to meet nephew this weekend. Could we please practice next week instead? I'd rather just get to spend time meeting nephew."" BIL: ""I'm worried we won't be ready by the show if we don't get at least a good couple of practices in. Let me know if you're still invested in this and confident it can happen. Otherwise I can cancel now and give them notice. I'd be pretty disappointed but want to be transparent with a venue."" The music was going to be the same that we performed at the winery, so I really didn't see this as a big deal, and the thought of running through a 3-4 hour practice of music that we had already established and practiced was the last thing I wanted to do trying to catch up on my life coming back from my honeymoon. I reiterated I was fairly confident and thought it was just going to be a catching up practice, I want the weekend to just be meeting my nephew, and to have a practice the following weekend. ""Well we need a set list, I start a new job next week (he quit his job six months prior because the last job he had worked at for three months was not going the way he wanted and everyone he worked with was an asshole so he had been unemployed up until now), so I don't know what my schedule is going to look like"". We didn't have a set list the last time, we just went down the music in the order it was arranged during the winery shows... why would we NOW need a set list? 

Around this same time, I had mentioned that the Christmas tree farm was going to be having a pop-up pre-Christmas craft sale the weekend after the coffee shop and that I thought it would be a good idea to go for a technical run through. This was met with every objection in the book: ""Well they're not going to pay for this show and moving forward you wanted to get paid (but they already agreed to pay for 6-8 shows between Thanksgiving and Christmas, with potential to be an exclusive music vendor for the wedding venue that they ALSO own??) ... they don't have room inside the shop, so I'm not setting up outside on that tiny porch or out in the dirt (can't throw down a tarp or some cardboard??)... I also have really poor circulation and we don't know what the weather is going to be like (even though he KNEW we'd be performing in a heated tent come December, and October's not that cold where we live??)... we don't have anything prepared to perform (but we can't just run through the music we've performed at the winery that we already know??)"" He turns down the Christmas pre-sale event and I have to go back to the owners and decline.   
  
If it hasn't become clear yet, BIL has severe control issues and it's either his way or get the hell out of his way. I guess you could say he doesn't play well with others, because outside of the music duo he has quit a handful of jobs due to people being ""assholes"" or ""the job not being what was in the description."" 

This is where I'm starting to realize we view this entire thing differently. BIL and my sister are coming up with marketing strategies, trying to turn our performances into a business, trying to acquire venues... and I am not as invested. I'm there to sing, make a little money, and have fun. I'm a realist about this whole thing- I know damn well that he and I are never going to popular or in demand as a music provider being a brother in law and sister acoustic cover duo. This space is competitive, and in all honestly- we're mediocre at best. But for some reason, BIL is making this duo his DREAM as though he wants to make this a business and full time project. 

We go to meet our nephew that weekend and he doesn't say a word about practicing. He contacts me that same day requesting an ""emergency meeting"" the following day to discuss ""band problems"" where I was berated for my lack of communication and willingness to practice music. This is where I made the mistake of pointing out that my sister was postpartum, I was concerned about her well being, and that between that and his new job I didn't think it was smart to continue with the show that we weren't even getting paid for. INSTANTLY torn to shreds by BIL and told my communication skills are garbage. I'm just exhausted from arguing with him and we finally agree to a practice. 

I find out I'm six weeks pregnant before this show at the smoothie shop but still haven't told anyone. A few days before the show, I'm expecting we were going to be set up outside on a patio where the local festival is partaking... and he informs me we're set up inside. The show day arrives... with minimal customers and hardly any traffic. There's a guitarist set up outside during the festival, but we were not allowed to because the smoothie shop didn't get permission to have us set up outside. I'm not going to lie, I'm irritated at this point because BIL never communicated any of these details to me until 3 days before the show. This feels like a waste of energy and time. While the venue was nice and the owners were very sweet, I couldn't help but sit there fuming by how much time I had spent practicing music. Here was I was performing for FREE in this smoothie shop, given this idea from BIL that there was going to be a ton of traffic from the festival and had a huge opportunity for tips- and the only tip we made was from my parents. And, once again, for the THIRD time, it was incredibly underwhelming.... and embarrassing.

BIL decides after this show that we're going to audition a male vocalist (we'll call him Axel) to join our group- this was a lead vocalist in an 80s cover band BIL had also participated in before BIL quit and basically destroyed the band (we'll get to that in a bit). This guy saw that BIL and I were doing something and was looking to continue singing and asked if he could join us. 

I want it to be clear, I really had nothing against Axel or him joining us. My issue was that after auditioning, BIL started immediately including him on all of the Christmas music that was lined up for the Christmas tree farm- which we had not discussed. I thought he would be joining us AFTER the Christmas shows. When Axel leaves, I ask BIL what I'm supposed to tell the owners at the tree farm, as the original agreement was that only BIL and I were going to be performing and we were getting paid $150/show. I don't understand why, but my sister decided to join in at this point in the conversation with BIL, and both made comments like ""wow, you're getting paid that much? That's a lot... do you not think that's enough for splitting it 3 ways??"" I reminded him that the owners were intentional about who they brought on to their farm and they met with us in person to get a feel for us, who we were, and what we were about. Axel had not been a part of this discussion- the owners had not met him. BIL proceeds to tell me that the meeting was weird in the first place not having to audition any music for them, it shouldn't be an issue to add one more person and if they have a problem with that then that's their issue, and that I should I ask them for $225 but if they push back we'll stick with the $150.

 I had a nice phone conversation with one of the owners regarding something else, but used this as an opportunity to mention that BIL decided to add a male vocalist to our performance. In that moment, I made the decision and call that because Axel was not part of the original agreement and that they never met, I was not going to be asking for more money- and the owners were very appreciative of this. They weren't upset that the decision was made to add a male vocalist, but I could tell they would have preferred meeting him and vetting him out during our initial meeting. When I shared this discussion with BIL, I was torn to shreds for not asking for more money. 

Our second practice with Axel, he texted he was going to be 15 minutes late because he was dealing with a mouse problem at home. At this point, I am eight weeks pregnant and planned on sharing the news before Axel got there with BIL and sister. Husband and I were busy prior to this practice between going to church and errands, so I decided to pick up lunch on my way to their house where we practice. I show up, on time, share the news with them, and mention that I picked up food because I didn't have time and now being pregnant, when I need to eat, I GOTTA EAT. Axel shows up (hungover, I might add from a college football game the day prior), BIL offers to practice Christmas songs I'm not singing with him on  while I eat. I come up to the practice room after 20 minutes. Practice is... rough, to say the least. There wasn't really a discussion the previous practice what we should focus on, and BIL chose a ton of pop songs that neither Axel nor I were familiar with (70-80% of our set list had been songs BIL chose before I started adding to it, which were more of the Christmas classics). When I leave, I come home to a text that BIL was severely disappointed in how much time had been wasted during our practice, and if we can't commit, or we need to eat (pointed at me, because I ate before practice- blood boiling at this point), or have other things to do, we need to say it now and communicate with him. Axel is quickly apologetic and says it won't happen again, but I get snippy about the eating comment and remind him that I am eight weeks pregnant and needed to eat. I also chose this as an opportunity to point out the hypocrisy of his actions from the week prior: Axel and I had to wait 20 MINUTES for BIL. Why? Because his dog decided to roll in goose poop. The dog needed to get cleaned up, and their newborn son was also fussing while all of this is going on. My sister is in the bathroom bathing the dog. Meanwhile, I keep running over to the nursery trying to soothe my nephew with his pacifier he keeps losing. BIL knocks on bathroom door to let my sister know that their son is fussing and crying... while she's in the middle of bathing their dog... and he needs to set up for practice. He sets up the room we practice in because it's a mess. Axel and I did not complain once about this. Bringing this up infuriated him and he told me that the situations were not even comparable. 

I had a conversation about several of these things with BIL over the phone. Ultimately it ended with me asking if moving forward he would rather work with Axel in the future instead of me, to which he said, ""well I don't know, but Axel never caused this many problems when we were in that previous band together..."" I tell him I'd like to take a break after the Christmas shows because if he'd rather work with Axel, he should and it wasn't a problem with me. BIL asked if I was so miserable I wasn't going to be able to keep it together for the Christmas shows... I told him I would be an adult about it and it's not going to be a problem. He thanks me for being honest and goes on to tell me that being in a band is probably much harder than I probably thought and how much work it truly is so he respects my decision... ignoring that, we conclude the call. 

We have another practice. No issues. This past week, one of the owners reached out to me asking for a sign, logo or some form of advertising that they could use advertise that we would be performing on the farm. They also ask for our schedule availability to lock down weekends we would be performing. I send over the schedule request to the group text between Axel, BIL, and  I. I reached out to my sister directly, explain what owner is asking for, and ask for the file of our band logo. She says she can't get to it that evening, but will get to it soon. She asked what context it was being used for and what file types were needed, we couldn't use past posters since they were specifically designed for the winery, and asked if we needed a new poster design. I explain, again, it doesn't even need to be an updated poster, owner just asked for a sign or logo so they could start advertising, we don't need to create more work than needed because a logo would work just fine, most of the advertising that the farm does is via Facebook. it's While conversing, I realize I could just save the logo from band's Facebook page and send that to the owner- I think that I'm saving my sister some time and stress with being post partum. I send this over to the group text asking them if it's okay that I send over the logo to the owner to use for advertising- it was pretty general, didn't have any photos of us, and it, after all, it was just a logo. Axel was fine with it, BIL didn't respond yet. Thinking Axel and I are the same page (even if BIL disagrees it's two against one), I send over saved logo image from Facebook to the owner; however, I let her know that my sister can also come up with a poster with our group's image on it. I also let sister know what I just did and that I send that saved logo image from Facebook to the owner- and this is where it goes downhill. 

Sister responds: ""Please don't in the future, I'd prefer they not run with it and DIY something! I'd like to have our materials cohesive and have the Instagram and FB info on posters ect. This was only produce for an intermediate cover photo."" Me: ""...All I did was send her the logo. I didn't share any of the other materials."" Sister: ""Yes, and I don't have control over what she does with it now."" Me: ""I told her you were also going to work on a new poster..."" Sister: ""Please communicate to her that we will be sharing a poster this week wither, thank you. FYI, type and size also matter... so if it was just a download off of Facebook or something it won't scale well. That's another reason I'd appreciate if you could allow me to share the native files.""   

  
I'm confused. While I respect and appreciate my sister creating a band logo for us, why is my sister, who does not contribute any music to this now evolved trio, have such a vested interest and is acting as a stakeholder in the group?? There's no watermark or anything on the logo, nothing saying that the logo belongs ONLY to her. There was never a conversation in the beginning about her being our ""marketing manager"". 

I can tell that she told her husband, because all of a sudden he's furiously responding to the chat between Axel and I. He asks that I not send any of the materials to the owner as my sister will be producing a new poster (again... it didn't have to be a poster... it could have just been the logo...) for the Christmas tree farm to use for marketing since they didn't have a proper marketing team. I told him that I shared the logo with the owner but that my sister would be preparing a poster as well, and he LOST IT... and I found out some other interesting information. Axel responds: ""Oh god, this is what broke up our original band, Further Than Lies lol"".   
  
What??   


I message Axel on the side- what I come to find out is when my sister created a band logo for  the band BIL was in, they did something very similar and shared the logo for an event on their Facebook page... WITHOUT his or my sister's permission. Maybe I'm wrong here, but I would think once you create a logo for a brand or a business, that's the end of it and they can do what they want with it from there on out (also... keep in mind my sister was doing all of this for free in her own time, for fun). BIL confronted the owner of the band about it, got nasty, and the owner told him to know his place and BIL didn't have a say in the matter because it was the band's logo to use. This spiraled into band drama and BIL leaving the band, and the band falling apart after he left (they reconnected after, rebuilt the band and are back to performing now). While it's none of our family's business, BIL's story was that the band members were all assholes and he needed to get out of it. While I'm finding all of this out, I disclose to Axel what the last month and a half has been like working with him. He starts questioning whether or not he really wants to be involved and says he may only get through the Christmas shows and leave because he doesn't need the BS in his life, but he'd like to try to make it work because it was the one hobby he has that he enjoys.

Axel is trying to clear things up in the group chat and says everything's all good, we're going to get them a brand new poster. BIL is NOT having it and is not backing down. BIL: ""WHY would you do that?? What was even the point of ASKING the group if you're not going to wait for MY input? WHO DOES THAT??"" I trying to reiterate the fact that the owner asked for a logo, poster, or ANYTHING we had and I was trying to get her an answer same day, along with our schedules for performing.  He kept saying ""The question is at hand and still stands, WHY would you do that?"" 

At this point- I'm incredibly fed up. I'm tired of constantly being wrong and getting berated, yelled at, and ridiculed by BIL. I responded: ""BIL- you can handle the communication with the owner from now on, I'm not going to play middleman anymore. I'm done."" BIL: ""Well that's fine, because I wanted to lead the communication with them anyways."" He asks for the owner's contact info and I send it. I reach out to the owner and inform them that BIL wants to be the main point of contact and he will be following up with her shortly. He basically restarts the entire conversation gathering our schedules and availability to send to the client and has my sister create a new marketing poster that evening. 

The next day, he sends screenshots of the owner thanking him for our schedules and availability, along with the poster my sister had created and the owner saying it looks great. ""Didn't my wife do SUCH an amazing job on the poster?? I think it turned out great."" Maybe I'm bitter at this point because of how things are going, but I'm not that impressed with the poster, and I think we still could have been fine with just using our logo. He also insists that the following practice we're going to make a Facebook post about introducing our newest vocalist and we need to get an updated group photo... which, in my opinion, is pointless, if I'm going to be removing myself from this whole thing. 

I spend the next two days crying and upset because of how conversations have been going with BIL. He's as argumentative as a lawyer, he's vindictive, and whatever I say to him is not valid; everything I say is an excuse and all I do is point fingers and cause problems. After talking through everything with my husband, I make the decision to schedule a call with BIL to remove myself from the Christmas shows all together. I'm approaching 10 weeks of pregnancy, I don't need the added stress, and I'm tired getting berated all the time. We are a little under four weeks from the first Christmas show. 

The phone call goes as you would expect it. I get right to the point and explain that things have not gotten better between him and I, there was never a break down from the beginning of who has ownership of what tasks when this whole thing started, and truth be told, there was never even a discussion about STARTING or LAUNCHING ourselves as a music duo. We both had different ideas of where the direction of our duo and we were not aligned. It was causing too much stress and anxiety, and ultimately I needed to remove myself. He goes quiet for a minute- and immediately starts blaming me for my lack of/horrible communication. ""You said you were going to be an adult about this, and now you're backing out of a commitment??"" I'm berated as usual over the phone, but I told him things haven't changed since the last conversation we had about taking a break after the Christmas shows and I need to do what's best for myself. I also told him that the new ""poster"" that was created was generic enough- it didn't have my name or face on it, only the band name and the dates we would be playing at the Christmas tree farm. It would also go back to being a duo, Axel and BIL, which is what the owners originally agreed to in the first place, and they would get more money that way instead of splitting it three ways. BIL tells me that my argument was stupid and not valid. I keep trying to reiterate my points, but I end up crying on the phone saying this was supposed to just be a fun hobby with BIL where we make a little money but it is no longer the case. BIL says in a nasty tone that it's no longer my problem anyways and now he's got to figure out what to do, hanging up the phone. 

As upset as I was, I've never felt so relieved in my life. Do you have any idea how good I slept with that weight off my shoulders?? 

The owner reached out to me to talk about something unrelated to the music, but I took this as the opportunity to tell them that I had removed myself and would not be performing at the Christmas shows. I didn't want to get too in the weeds, but I explained I was 10 weeks pregnant and shared some details about what had been happening between BIL and I behind the scenes- it was causing stress and anxiety and I needed to remove myself. As disappointed as they were, they were so kind and understanding about the situation, and actually sensed something was going on behind the scenes from some of BIL's actions and the way he had started communicating with them. I felt SEEN. I'm not the only one that see's BIL's poor behavior!! Owner said that BIL did not contact them regarding the whole situation and the conversation would be kept between herself and I. She would wait to hear from BIL whether or not he wanted to resume the shows. My mom (who knows what has been going on this whole time) thinks I should tell BIL I spoke to the owners, but I disagree- BIL wanted ownership of the communication with the owners, he took that responsibility upon himself. I didn't owe him anything at this point. 

Conversations with my sister seem to appear to be normal- I share the ultrasound video with her, we talk about pregnancy, etc. I ask her if she wanted to get pizza during the week with two of our cousins, and once again, the drama starts. 

Sister: ""I would like to talk to you about your conversations and your quitting the music group."" Me: ""Sam, that was a conversation between BIL and I. Why do you and I need to talk about the music group? If this has to do with the logo, I thought I apologized to you. If I didn't, I'm sorry. I am. The owners wanted a logo. I chatted with mom about it, and she was the one who suggested saving the image from Facebook and sending it to them. I didn't know it causes problems saving and downloading it, and I'm sorry for assuming this, but I thought I was saving you the burden and stress of creating an entirely new poster. I shouldn't have assumed that- but it was just a logo, I didn't think it was that big of a deal."" Sister: ""I'm not doing this over text. I will talk to you face to face."" Me: ""I'm not talking to you about the music group. You want to talk about the logo, we can talk about that."" Sister: ""Okay, well we have things to talk about though... things that impact me and my husband. I'm asking you if you'll have a conversation with me, but that is your choice."" Me: ""I'm not understanding how the music group impacted you or how me removing myself from the group impacted you. I'm really not trying to be rude, I'm trying to understand. If this is about the equipment, I paid for my portion of it. Can you just explain how this impacts you personally? I'm trying to understand."" Sister: ""I'm not doing this over text It's actually not about the logo."" Me: "" I'm not going to discuss the music group with you. That was between BIL and I and it will stay that way. You want to talk about anything else, and I'm down. I intentionally started contacting BIL directly over text regarding anything pertaining to the music group instead of the chat with you, BIL and I. I reached out to you directly because you created the logo and I wanted a copy of the file until I got the idea to download it from Facebook. Again- you want to talk and catch up? We can do that anytime. But that conversation stays between him and I."" Sister: ""We have things going on that we have to discuss... and resolve to move forward here. It's bigger than any one small thing. Not going to just sweep this under the rug like everything is fine. Until you and I have an ADULT conversation face to face, I don't consider things cool, and all of our relationships matter and my husband's well being matters to me very much. I will not be texting you back and forth. When you are ready to talk face to face, I would like to discuss."" Me: ""What needs to be resolved between you and I? We're not going to have a conversation about it. You don't think things are cool and I understand that. Also just going to point out here that my husband is not getting himself involved in this situation..."" Sister: ""Well that's unfortunate that you have decided that and feel that way."" 

Sister and BIL are entitled to their feelings- they have a right to feel angry and upset. I'm sure my sister feels caught in the middle between us and wants to be supportive of her husband's dream. But I can't wrap my head around this conversation and how this music group that originally was just BIL and I has any impact on her, or how me leaving the group affected her husband's ""well-being"". 

It's been about a day and it feels like a standoff at this point. I vented about the entire situation with my parents, who are well aware of BIL's shitty behavior, his control issues, and his awful way of talking to people. My mom, however, is the peacemaker who just wants harmony all the time, which means I'm supposed to just apologize to BIL and continue with the whole music duo situation because ""it's BIL's dream"". She told me after visiting with sister yesterday at their house, BIL seemed incredibly sad and depressed because he loves Christmas music and was really looking forward to performing these Christmas shows. He doesn't feel like he can recover enough of the music with Axel to be ready in time, because there were certain songs I was singing solo or songs that he changed the key in order to fit my vocal range. I told her none of that matters anymore- BIL wanted full control of the music group and he got what he wanted. I already talked to the owners of the Christmas tree farm and told them I wasn't performing, if BIL wants to pull out of the agreement, he can handle that conversation himself with the owners. And, with where things stand, I have no intention of spending Thanksgiving at BIL and sister's house this year due to the tension and the way BIL had disrespectfully spoken to me so many times. 

So... 

Do I truly owe BIL an apology? 

Do I tell him that I already spoke to the owner that I will not be performing in the music group? 

Do I really owe my sister a face to face meeting to discuss the music group being dismantled and how all of this impacts her, her husband, and our relationships with each other?

Do husband and I still attend Thanksgiving at BIL and sister's house amid all of the drama? 

And most importantly... am I the asshole here?

I added some more details, this is gonna be a long post. 
So my colleague (24f) (34f)  has two kids. Her first language is not English, its Bulgarian. She knows i am a lesbian. 

We work in different departments. She's shy and kind of cold to everyone except me. I get special favours no one else does to the point that every one of my coworkers has noticed. We play this game of back and forth teasing and joking. We'll lock eyes all the time. In a group we are always staring at eachother. It doesn't matter what we're doing, we're always staring at one another it's s like magnets. 

I have blue hair, and someone said we 'looked good' together she DEMANDED we take a selfie. This is not the first time she has demanded we have a photoshoot together. After her maternity leave, her first day back she took a set of like 9 pics and handed our colleagues her phone demanding to document that we we're back together. I'm always taking pics of her and she let's me (she hates being photographed) 

She will call me a nickname I hate, and follow me around if I'm getting a drink or a snack she's there asking if she can have one too like 'Oh you didn't get one for meeee?' I had ONE cup ready to get a coffee for myself. She saw me, stole my cup out of my hand and made herself a coffee saying 'You're trying to keep me longer at work, aren't you!' even though she was in a rush. She will bring me a coffee in the morning and remembers my order. 

Now the weird part.
She calls me bestie. She uses this term 80% to refer to people who are dating. Rarely it means friend.  She makes everyone well aware of the fact that i am her bestie. Someone bought me chocolate and she said 'She's trying to be besties with you...' and has referred to another lesbian coworker and her literal wife as 'Besties'

She also has 2 young kids who I've met. Which is important because her kids are her life. She doesn't let anyone meet them or know about them. She tells me all the time how they are and she tells them all about me. I got them some pumpkins for Halloween and she got the kids to video call me because they knew *i* got them for them and she told me she kept telling them they were from me. She also sends me their school report cards so I can come over and help them with their English. 

She will text me selfies of her and the kids, or just her. When she gets her nails done she will send me a pic to see if I like them.

I also told her a i watched the film Bodies Bodies Bodies were a Bulgarian actress plays a lesbian and she said 'Oh so you were watching a movie and thinking of me?'

Am I overthinking this and just being dumb or is she possibly flirting with me??  ",0,1731185747.0,bodylanguage,0,0.33,False

*Sweet Memories* opens with a warm blend of rhubarb and tobacco. Soon, the almond, vanilla custard, and coffee cake enter, which lend a smooth, spicy, and ‚Äúmilky‚Äù feel to the scent. Rounding out the rest of the blend are notes of vanilla and amber. This perfume blend is complex and advanced, totally elevated from the typical gourmands and orientals.

(USA),"I (36M) currently live in a 2 bedroom 1 bath with two roommates. Me and one of my roommates have their own bedroom and my other roommate sleeps on the sofa in the living room. I've been in this situation for 7 months and it has been an unpleasant experience. One of my roommates is okay, but he doesn't have a car and regularly asks me for rides to nearby places, which is fine sometimes but sometimes I'm just not in the mood, so I decline and he's okay with that. The other roommate (the one that sleeps on the couch) has a mental illness - which doesn't bother me - except that he doesn't regularly take his meds so his behavior is quite strange. He'll wake up in the middle of the night and loudly talk to himself and run up and down the halls making a lot of noise. He also doesn't have a towel (I know - what kind of adult doesn't have a towel) so after he showers the bathroom floor will be completely wet. He also spends a lot of time in the bathroom in general because that's his ""safe space"". He also has stolen food items from me on numerous occasions. I've come home from work to find my food missing from the fridge, my coffee missing and on one occasion my closet was a complete mess with my clothes thrown all over the place - that one especially pissed me off. He admitted to all those things but he acts like it's not a big deal. The landlord doesn't care as long as the rent is paid on time. Anytime there's an issue his response is ""just figure it out amongst yourselves"". This home is also in a crappy area, far away from most things and basically in the middle of nowhere. The only reason I chose to stay here is because I'm trying to pay off a lot of debt and the rent here is relatively cheap.

Recently a friend of mine suggested that I look into renting an Airbnb room long term. I found one in an area of town that is much more appealing and an area that I'm also more familiar with. The monthly payment is also less than what I'm paying now. The host has a great rating and is very responsive, she has already answered a few of my questions. Airbnb also seems like less hassle, no background check, no credit check and no deposit. The only thing that worries me is that there will be different people staying there at different times, with new people every few weeks. Although I'm a pretty extroverted person and like to socialize, I do like my alone time as well, especially between midnight - 8 AM when I'll be sleeping. I'm used to having my own apartment but again I'm paying off some credit cards and hospital bills so I'm trying to save as much money as possible, once I'm done paying off my debt I'll get my own place again.

How do I move forward?,"This is going to be insanely long and I am sorry about that. I am trying to make sense of a lot of things that I have never said to anyone. I know this is disjointed and hard to follow. I appreciate even just having the space to write this all down.

Because it‚Äôs easy to only share things from my perspective, I think it is important to get a few relevant facts and a few of my husband‚Äôs frustrations out in the open. Some of these things are just important things to keep in mind to help understand the things that have happened.

1. I am a stay at home mom.

2. I don‚Äôt drive.

3. I am terrible with finances.

4. I have always been an absentminded and messy person. You can generally tell how I am doing emotionally by the state of my ‚Äúpersonal spaces.‚Äù When things are good, spaces are clean with just some clutter here and there. When things are bad, spaces are sometimes downright slovenly.


My husband and I got married because I was pregnant. I really do think we loved each other. I know I loved him very much.

My husband(let‚Äôs call him Will) lived with a female roommate when we met. This was a non issue. His roommate was great and I trusted Will completely.

After about a year of dating, Will started lying to me about the dumbest things. He would say he was going to bed and then stay up playing video games with his female roommate. He would sometimes do favors for her or they would stay up and talk. None of this was an issue. I trusted him and I thought this was normal roommate behavior. I just found it weird that he would lie about it.

The lying started to drive a small wedge between us but I didn‚Äôt really let that wedge grow because I trusted Will. Sure, he was lying. But the things he was lying about didn‚Äôt matter so was it really worth making a big issue about it?

When I got pregnant, we weren‚Äôt ready at all. I worked full time, was in school, and relied on public transit to get to everywhere. Will lived about an hour‚Äôs drive away from me. When we chose to have the baby and move in together, I asked that we look for a place that was midway between my area and his, so that I could keep my job and stay in school. Will drew a circle on a map and said we couldn‚Äôt move outside of a radius of a couple miles from his house. His rationale was that he made the majority of the money and he needed to be close to work. He was the one who had all of the money for first, last, and deposit and he said he would not put money down on an apartment that was any further than the circle. I told him that this would mean I would be spending four plus hours every day on public transit. Will said that it might not even be practical for me to return to a low paying job while having a newborn. I agreed to move inside the circle.

When looking for apartments, Will found out there was a vacancy in his current complex. I wanted to start somewhere fresh, in a location that was new for both of us. I thought we agreed till one day he left me at the house with his roommate and she started selling me on the idea of us moving into their complex. After a few hours of this, she finally broke down and said she had been put up to it by Will. She said she felt like I was being manipulated and didn‚Äôt want to be a part of it and she wanted me to know the truth. I confronted Will about it and he lied until I said I would leave if he didn‚Äôt come clean. He finally admitted that he put her up to it.

It‚Äôs not that I cared that he wanted to advocate for the place he wanted. I just hated that instead of having a conversation with me about what was right for our life, he lied. And he recruited someone else into the lie. This was the first lie that felt like an actual issue.

We ultimately found an apartment and Will had to tell his roommate he was moving out. She wanted him to pay the full current month‚Äôs rent, plus two additional months. Will and I felt this was excessive and he pushed back. She still asked for the two additional months. Will told me he would only pay one additional month. But then he paid her the second additional month behind my back and lied about it when confronted.

We entered into a period where he was lying to me a lot. He would lie for seemingly no reason other than to avoid having a discussion with me. I was pregnant and didn‚Äôt know what to do and we ended up getting married. I convinced myself that the lies weren‚Äôt BAD lies. They were lies I could deal with.

Before giving birth, we had a discussion about who I wanted in the delivery room. We agreed that it would be me, him, and my mother. He asked if his mom could be in the room and I said I would rather not have her there. Honestly, I kind of didn‚Äôt even want MY mother there because we were estranged at the time. Will agreed to talk to his mom and told me several times that I did not have to worry about it because he handled it.

I developed preeclampsia and had to be induced early. The whole thing was kind of scary. I was in unmedicated labor for two nights before the nurses started trying to convince me to take the epidural. I finally agreed and as the needle was being inserted, Will tells me that his mother is crying in the lobby and even though we had already discussed it, he just wanted to see if she can come in. At that point I was exhausted, scared, angry, and felt kind of betrayed. I said ‚Äúfine,‚Äù and he went and got her. His mother joined us and was elated. Will spent most of the rest of my time in labor on his phone. I found out later that he was updating his Facebook status to things like, ‚ÄúKeep going, baby! Push! You‚Äôre almost there!‚Äù and interacting with people in the comments. None of these things were said to me in real life. I would ask him to rub my back through the contractions and he would halfheartedly do it for a few seconds before returning to the couch and his phone.

I lost about half of my blood volume and needed a transfusion. I had to stay in the hospital for three days after giving birth and was told that I would likely need help for several weeks, possibly even a month or more. When we got home, there was almost no help. He had work and made a rule that he couldn‚Äôt get up with her at night because that would affect his work. I agreed with this because we couldn‚Äôt lose his income. He started to feel like he had to be on duty the second he walked in the door, so he made another rule that he would get an hour to decompress after getting home before I asked him anything.

I was alone in this new city and had a newborn so I felt very stuck during the week. We would run errands together on weekends as a family and when we would get home, I would take the baby and her car seat up the stairs to the apartment to get changed, fed, and into her crib. During that time, my husband would bring the groceries into the house. One day, he stopped bringing them into the house and left them on the halfway point of the stairs outside. He said he felt it wasn‚Äôt fair that he had to take them up alone. So he started taking them halfway and I would bring them the rest of the way. Eventually, this felt embarrassing and inconsiderate of our neighbors so I told him to leave the groceries in the car and I would just bring them all the way up myself after feeding and putting down the baby. I know this seems small but I feel like it is relevant to know how petty he gets when he feels like he is doing more than his share. Even if that feeling isn‚Äôt based in anything true.

During this time, he‚Äôs still lying to me about dumb stuff. Saying he didn‚Äôt go to Jack in the Box. Lying about going to a coffee shop with his friends. Lying about things that make no sense to lie about. The lies and isolation hit me hard and I developed pretty severe postpartum depression. I feel like I have to say that I have never felt suicidal before this and have never felt suicidal since. But I felt suicidal then and I told him about it. He told me to sleep on it and literally never brought it up again.

(I‚Äôm going to jump a few years to say that I eventually talked to Will about how it felt to know that I could tell him I wanted to die and he never checked back in to ask if I was okay. We argued about this for months and he eventually bought me a giant Mrs. Field‚Äôs cookie with the words, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù written on it. Lol. No, he didn‚Äôt also ask me to my face and no, we never talked about it.)

As I struggled through postpartum, I finally reached out to a friend and started talking to her about it. Will found me in the closet, crying on the phone and asked me what was happening. I wrapped up the phone call and told him that I just needed someone to help me. He then told me that saying things like this to friends would change the way people looked at him. Once you cause your friends to look at your spouse negatively, you can‚Äôt take it back. He told me that we should talk to each other and not let people‚Äôs opinions into our relationship in ways that could hurt us. He told me his uncle taught him that you can pick a trusted family member of the same sex and discuss it with them, but letting friends into your problems will destroy your marriage. I was dumb as fuck so that made sense to me.

This is already so long and we aren‚Äôt even at the real problems. I am going to have to go through this faster. Things continue going on pretty much the same for about eight years.

Will started making more money and becoming more well known in his field. He worked on several big movies before getting on the project that really changed his career and our lives. He went from making semi-okay money and being relatively unknown to making good money and being very well known in his industry. He still lied during this time. At this point, it‚Äôs a feature of Will. He works and he lies about things.

Once Will started making good money, he expected me to know how to manage it. When we were broke, we were both involved with the finances and jointly knew nothing and fucked up together. But when he started making good money, he expected me to manage it alone. I should have learned how to do this. I didn‚Äôt. I made sure things were paid and that my daughter had everything she needed. When he was on a movie, we could generally stockpile 12k in a couple months without even needing to really cut back. But then the movie would end and he would be off for three months. We would spend that 12k and sometimes go into debt. Then he would get on a movie and we would spend a few weeks/a month getting out of debt and stockpiling 12k again. I didn‚Äôt know how to manage finances when I couldn‚Äôt anticipate what was coming in. I should have sought outside help but I didn‚Äôt see it as a problem till far too late.

Once we started to realize that our finances were wildly mismanaged, we started to set soft budgets. We would set a target amount to go into long term savings and a certain amount to go into savings that would be used after the current job ended. Then we would figure out how much was left for discretionary spending. Will would often spend almost all of the discretionary money without discussing it. But he still expected both savings pots to be funded as normal. There were also weeks when we agreed on the way to spend the discretionary money and he would also buy something for himself, forcing me to either have to transfer money out of savings to cover bills or allow them to lapse and pay them later. Will would get very upset when money was transferred from savings, regardless of whether or not it he spent the discretionary money or even dipped into the money for that week‚Äôs bills. Savings was on autotransfer if funds got low  and I would make sure there was enough money in checking for the bills. So there would be times when he would spend money on something like tickets and clothes for an event and then get pissed at me when ‚Äúmy‚Äù transactions caused the auto-transfers later in the week.

Me not driving cost us a lot of money. My daughter was in an expensive sport that had long practices  almost daily and I used Uber/lift to get us there and anywhere else we needed to go. At one point, we were spending close to 1k/month on Uber alone. I don‚Äôt blame my choice to not learn to drive on anyone. I don‚Äôt even know why I haven‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think I can answer it honestly, even to myself. I think fear and shame is some of it. I don‚Äôt feel afraid of driving but I do feel afraid of being bad at it and hurting someone. I‚Äôm afraid of my incompetence causing harm to someone else that I can‚Äôt take back. But I don‚Äôt even think that is the full, real answer. All I do know is that I have had years of opportunity and I have not done it. And this choice cost us a lot of money.

I settled into a lot of bad choices. I got tired of fighting about the way his attitude felt like, ‚ÄúBudgets for thee and not for me!‚Äù If he didn‚Äôt want us to pinch pennies together, then I just wouldn‚Äôt pinch pennies either. He was lying to me and was rarely home and I think the truth of it is that living comfortably made that feel okay. Or, maybe not okay but livable. I kind of told myself that I didn‚Äôt need to fight about where my husband was or what he was lying about because my daughter had this amazing life and I could be happy with that. Me being dumb as fuck is a running theme here. I recognize that my own stupidity is maybe even the main problem in all of this.

And then comes Pablo.

Pablo(name changed) is a person who worked in pretty much the same field as my husband. He was one of the more famous guys in this industry and had a huge amount of followers on Instagram(something my husband now noticed and talked about). Pablo was athletic. He was single. And he became Will‚Äôs best friend.

From the moment Will and Pablo became friends, Will‚Äôs attitude toward me changed. It used to feel like we were working things out but I was angry that he kept lying to me. This switched to feeling like Will had this rage that was always bubbling under the surface and would explode during moments of stress. There was one Christmas when I asked him if we could take the money we would normally spend on gifts and use it for a small trip to San Diego. My daughter couldn‚Äôt list a single physical thing she wanted that year and only asked to stay in a hotel. When I brought this up to will, he lost it. He screamed, ‚ÄúWith what money?? With what money??‚Äù and literally backed me into a corner while screaming into my face. Seeing it typed out makes it seem much more reasonable than it felt in the moment. He‚Äôs not tall but I am quite short and he was towering over me as I tried to shrink into a corner while he was screaming directly into my face. It seems tame when typed out, but it didn‚Äôt feel that way in real life. He told me that I was nothing but a nanny and he could hire a nanny to replace me. I told him that I could just take our daughter to spend Christmas in Vegas with my mom and he said he wouldn‚Äôt pay for it.

I want to make it clear how much Will bought for himself during this period of time. Before Christmas, he personally bought himself hundreds of dollars worth of items that cost way more than the SD trip I planned. I admit that I spent a lot of money on Uber and wanted my daughter to be comfortable and have the things she wanted and needed. But ridiculous spending was not a one way street that would make this blow up at me warranted. And, for the record, the Christmas gifts we ultimately bought(agreed upon by him) would have also covered the cost of the trip.

After, I tried to talk about how this altercation scared me. Will would have none of it. He mocked me for being scared and told me that I was trying to make him feel like he was abusive. He would only agree to discuss the situation if I was willing to talk about how I pushed him to that point. I was unwilling to talk about it that way because my entire point was that his reaction should have never been an option. My fear was that this was a point that he COULD be pushed to. In order to feel safe, I needed to know that would never happen again. He refused to talk about it further.

During this time, he was working on the biggest movie of his life. It was a big deal and he found himself going to award shows, doing interviews, and getting invited into rooms that he never thought he would be in. He would invite me to go with him and I just‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt. I am not particularly social by nature but it also felt impossible to stand by someone who I was starting to feel treated me poorly behind closed doors. I know that some people will feel I am overreacting but that altercation felt violent and it was messing with my mind.

Will started feeling angry that I was ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù him when he was finally reaping the rewards of all the years of work he had put into his craft. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt stand by him and have people tell me how great he is and how lucky I am to have him when I didn‚Äôt feel that way. His refusal to talk about what happened made me feel silenced and standing by him made me feel complicit in that silencing.

I am sorry this is so long. I am trying to condense.

My husband got our daughter an iPad and used his AppleID to set it up. I was sitting with her one day and a semi-naked photo of a woman comes through. It was from Pablo.

I open the messages and see that Pablo is bragging about this woman to my husband and sending photos of her cooking for him. Over the course of several days, I see that Pablo talks about women extensively to my husband. There were detailed accounts of sexual encounters, rating/ranking women, sending photos to my husband that appeared to have been meant solely for Pablo‚Äôs eyes. Once, Pablo even described events that ultimately amounted to stalking a woman and showing up at her apartment unannounced. My husband told him that ‚Äúshe knows she misses that dick.‚Äù No condemnation. No push back. I hate even typing this out.

I also found out that Pablo had been either fired or forced out of an adjacent industry because of things that happened in relationships with his colleagues. There was a forum online where Pablo was being discussed as a predator and my husband told Pablo that ‚Äúthe white guys were just jealous they can‚Äôt compete with your black dick.‚Äù

Will is weirdly obsessed with Pablo‚Äôs dick. I have never seen anyone else say shit like that.

When Pablo started sending my husband photos that seemed like they were meant just for Pablo‚Äôs eyes, I felt it was necessary to tell Will that I had seen them. I told him that, as a woman, sending intimate photos to a  person who was not the intended recipient was a huge breach of trust. I told him that I realized that this wasn‚Äôt a conversation I was supposed to be privy to but that his reaction felt disappointing. No one was standing up for those women and telling Pablo to stop. I told him that the things he said were gross and I expected better of him as a married man.

He lost his SHIT. He told me I didn‚Äôt want him to have friends, that I was trying to make him look bad, that this is just how guys talk. He latched on the word ‚Äúgross‚Äù and will randomly remind me of how I called him gross, even to this day. I stand by it. It was gross and weird.

This is getting far too long so I‚Äôm just going to say that this continues for two-ish years. Pablo does weird shit, my husband co-signs, I protest, he blows up and blames me. They are weird-ass best friends against the world. In an industry of mostly women, mind you. During the fucking Me-too movement.

One day, my husband comes to me and tells me he needs to say something. He says that I have always had great intuition and he should have trusted me. He said that there is a woman who has created an instagram page dedicated to exposing Pablo. Apparently she and other women were uniting because of their experience with Pablo. These women had been stalked, bullied, and threatened with the release of their intimate photos. My husband acted gobsmacked. Why? I don‚Äôt know. They literally just wrote down the shit we already knew years ago. But he was pretend gobsmacked and I heard him out. He said he should have listened to me and that it is news to him that Pablo is a bad person. But then he also told me that the woman who started the page is a crazy 22 year old who is doing this to be malicious. That seemed like weird information to know, so I asked him if he had spoken to her. He was like, ‚Äúno! I would never! That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù I accepted that for a while but my gut kept gnawing at me. I told him that I was sorry to ask again but my intuition has never failed me and it was calling bullshit. He looked me in my eye and told me he never spoke to her. He told me how this is probably just a residual feeling that comes from the lies he has told in the past. He told me that even though he picks up the weight of that burden every day, it is hard on him to know I don‚Äôt trust him when he is telling the truth. He told me that it is probably even harder because my father wasn‚Äôt in my life.

Two days later, the girl makes a post calling my husband out for continuing to contact her and threaten her with legal action. Lol. So not only was he calling her, he was trying to silence her, too.

When I brought this up to Will, he said that he only god involved because she is pretending to be a victim and she didn‚Äôt really feel taken advantage of, she was just trying to get revenge. She, the 22 year old young woman, was trying to vilify him, the 40 year old married man with all the industry contacts and good reputation. He would only agree to talk about it if we talked about how blindsided he was and how shocked he must be to find out his friend is trash. It was so crazy to watch something major happen to you and others and to have that reality completely denied. The person I needed to discuss this with would only discuss it with me if we talked about it as though the way it happened wasn‚Äôt the way it happened. Wild.

He would also tell me he didn‚Äôt have time to discuss any of this with me but would then be in Zooms with other industry people talking about what a betrayal this is and how he was as shocked as they were. Fucking HOW? My husband was pretty much the one person who DID know. And the stupid piety he had afterward was unbearable. There was an event he was going to and he wanted to wear his Time‚Äôs Up pin and asked me to help pin it to his lapel. I wanted to stab him with it.

I don‚Äôt know why this broke me as much as it did. Something inside of me just gave up. I stopped leaving the house. I became a full recluse. I became so afraid of seeing anyone we jointly knew. My husband knew all of this ahead of time. So did I. Neither of us said shit. I didn‚Äôt track those women down on socials and let them know what was being said and shared about them. I just rolled over and let it all happen. Will was getting these messages two years prior to when all of this came out publicly. That was two years of trauma that might not have happened to someone if either of us had said something. But we didn‚Äôt and now Will‚Äôs pontificating on the internet so that people will tell him how great he is.

I started getting heart palpitations that were ultimately diagnosed as panic attacks. I would be sitting in a room and all of a sudden my heart rate would shoot up to 155 bpm on my Fitbit. I started gaining a crazy amount of weight due to inactivity.
I only left the house when absolutely necessary.

We were driving to visit my family for Thanksgiving later that year and it rained the whole day. We were driving faster than I felt was safe, so I asked Will to slow down. He snapped at me about being the one who knew how to drive. He increased his speed after a while and I had to weigh the benefit of saying something again. I knew Will had only sped up to spite me for saying something to begin with. Saying something again might get him to slow, but it also could cause him to lash out more. But I was getting freaked out so I said something. He snipped at me again about not knowing how to drive and continued at an unsafe pace. He took one hand off the wheel and started tapping out a beat. It felt like he was trying to be petty. We hit a puddle of water, slid, hit the center divide, then spun out on the freeway. Thankfully, we were all okay. Bystanders helped us get to the side of the road and everything ended up alright.

It terrifies me that I know we got into an accident because he wanted to punish me. It terrifies me that I can‚Äôt prove it. It terrifies me that my daughter was in the car. I am disgusted that I should have taken action that day, and I haven‚Äôt. I am disgusted that all I have done is make sure she doesn‚Äôt ride long distances with him anymore. And if we have to, I use the ‚Äúsanitized by light‚Äù approach of having someone on the phone because he doesn‚Äôt pull shit like that when people are around to see it. I have become so ineffective and incompetent and dependent. Leaving the house feels hard. Talking to a stranger feels hard. I am a shell of the person I used to be and when I look back at the things that happened, I don‚Äôt think anyone would think it was that bad. I don‚Äôt know why I have been completely immobilized by a relationship that doesn‚Äôt even look that bad when you write it out.

My husband asked for us to not discuss the relationship with others, but I found out he had been discussing me all along. He would take pictures and video of rooms and spaces I allowed to get filthy so that people will understand what he has to deal with. He talked about our dissolving relationship with female coworkers and pretended I was trying to stop him from getting support when I felt betrayed. I‚Äôm not the one who made that rule. He was. I was just shocked to find out I was the only one expected to actually do it. He talked about me to others the entire time.

I‚Äôm not even really seeking advice about the relationship. I feel like I am struggling to understand what even happened here. Is this normal? Are these fights the type of things people just go through in a marriage? Am I making these things bigger than they need to be? Why do these feel like major blows when it doesn‚Äôt even seem that bad on paper?

My uncle got cancer many years ago and we were eventually told it was terminal. We went to thanksgiving with them a few months after getting that news and had a good time. The topic of my grandmother‚Äôs housekeeping came up and led to all of us discussing whether we personally want to keep an immaculate home. I said that I didn‚Äôt feel like everything needed to be pristine, others shared their views, and we all moved on. After, Will told me that my uncle pulled him to the side and asked, ‚ÄúWhat was up with that?‚Äù He told me that my uncle told him that he needed to nip this in the bud because it was a slippery slope. He said that my uncle was disappointed to hear I didn‚Äôt prioritize keeping things neat.

This immediately sounded like bullshit. My uncle didn‚Äôt give AF about stuff like that. My aunt didn‚Äôt keep THEIR house in pristine condition. His own kids and THEIR wives didn‚Äôt live like that. But for some reason, he pulled my husband to the side and said he was disappointed in ME? Will lied about it when confronted and then continued lying until I said we would just have to call my uncle to confirm. He then admitted he lied and said that he had been pushed to a breaking point and was looking for backup anywhere we could find it. From that point, he would only engage in conversation about this if I would discuss it the ways I pushed him to that point.

My uncle died a few years later and I told Will over the phone because he was out. When he got home, he went straight into Zoom meetings. After, he told me that a friend was having a rough day with work and he was going to sit on the porch and talk with him(Covid). When his friend left, my husband texted to let me know he would be going on a drive to clear his head. I later texted him to say that it was disappointing to know that a family member could die and he still won‚Äôt do anything to support me. He gave a halfhearted apology and then blamed me for it. From that point, he refused to talk about it if we did not talk about the ways I make it impossible to support me.

Earlier this year, I was trying to get him to understand why I feel so afraid of him. I tried to get him to understand that I never know where the line is with him. He will cross lines of decency and then blame me for it and that scares me. I tried to explain to him that if he will lie to me about my terminally ill uncle being disappointed in me, what won‚Äôt he lie about? He then told me that ACTUALLY, my uncle had said all of those things and even MORE things that he didn‚Äôt bring up because he didn‚Äôt want to hurt my feelings. He said that he only retracted his statement because he didn‚Äôt want to get my uncle in trouble. This was complete bullshit. I got off the phone and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was married to a man who would double down on lies about my dead uncle, to gain absolutely nothing.

We were arguing one day and he told me that if anyone heard about the things that have happened between us, no one would believe me. I told him that this felt like a threat and he immediately wanted me to know that he wasn‚Äôt trying to threaten me. But that is what is so scary. I know it wasn‚Äôt a threat. It‚Äôs a fact. No one would believe me. It‚Äôs just true.

I don‚Äôt even know what I am asking or why I typed all of this out. I thought I would re-read it and know why I feel like I have been run over by a truck but it all seems so small when it is written out. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I can‚Äôt seem to get myself off the floor, I feel like I have been beaten up and he has never laid a finger on me. It‚Äôs just many, many instances like the ones I have described. I don‚Äôt know why the cumulative effect has been so hard for me to deal with personally. I am terrified of him and I know he would never strike me. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this and allowed yourself to become ineffective as a result? What steps did you take to start feeling competent again? I feel like I don‚Äôt even know where to begin detangling what my life has become.

TLDR: After being lied to for years about things of varying importance, I have grown depressed, anxious, and reclusive. Seeking help from people who have become immobilized by bad relationships and have found ways to feel competent again.",1,1731183923.0,relationship_advice,2,0.6,False

I am not a big drinker (alcohol or soda) at all, but I will be drinking as it will be for a bachelorette trip. From what I understand, water/coffee/tea/coke/etc. is not complimentary/included in the cruise price after breakfast. Is this true???

1gniwwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/1gniwwj/dragon_age_the_veilguard_disappointed_me_more/,Dragon Age: The Veilguard Disappointed me More than Starfield,"Last year, around this time, I thought to myself that nothing would disappoint me more than Starfield. Surely, I thought, a letdown like this wasn't even possible to replicate. That was, until I played Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

I have never seen a studio bastardize and spit in the face of a franchise quite like this in my entire life. It's the same sort of issue fans have had with Disney buying up all of these properties only to put out slop with terrible writing that nobody can quite get behind.

I waited ten years for this game, I have played the dragon age franchise all the way through multiple times, something I almost never do. I played them all again this year in preparation for the release of this game, only to find that a mere 3 choices would carry over.

Much more than that though, way beyond the Keep not really functioning here, the writing in this game is absolutely atrocious. This is not a roleplaying game, the fact that it even has dialogue options is a mere facade. All of your choices will boil down to ""yes and I love that for you"", all of your responses will be supportive, all of your interactions will be a therapy session. This is a friendship simulator masking as a Dragon Age game. This completely removes all player agency and replayability for a franchise that is known for nothing but.

The tone is very, very marvel. It is nothing and I mean nothing like what Bioware has built up until this point. I don't give a shit when it comes to ""not being dark enough"" but what I care about is the complete lack of gray morality. I have seen more of a mixed moral compass on an episode of fucking Goosebumps than I ever did in my 50+ hours in this game. It is clear here that Bioware was going to pull you kicking and screaming through THEIR story no matter what and that there was nothing you were going to be able to do to change that.

This game is filled to the brim with toxic positivity and decisions that I cannot for the life of me understand how it made it past the writers room first rough draft. Characters saying things like ""they go hard"", ‚Äúit‚Äôs quiet‚Ä¶too quiet‚Äù and an assassin bemoaning over how someone brewed his coffee.... This has become a beacon for a culture war, which unfortunately means it will get hate AND support blindly, but let me be the first to tell you, that it doesn't shield it from being torn apart, just like any other game that has ever existed regardless of it's political messaging, and trust me, there is a LOT of that here.

This game often cares more about being a sermon than a story. It constantly belittles and preaches to you about how you should act, think and feel, all the while never allowing you to call out any of your companions for hypocrisy or contradictions. Taash, in particular, regardless of how you feel about her storyline, is the most annoying, insufferable, unbearable character that Bioware has ever made. That is a really unfortunate misstep, they really should have focused on making that character really cool and interesting, but instead they end up doing more harm than good and perpetuating the stereotype that people already have about that community. 

The combat is literally the exact same thing you can get in New World, an MMO. The DNA of a live service game is still very much here and it shows. Your companions cannot die, and the enemies very rarely ever target them anyway. The re-skinned boss battles and mob fights become dull after mere hours into the 50 hour long campaign, and your fight ten hours in will be the exact same as it is several hours in. 

What I can say positively is that the environmental artists did an excellent job. The landscapes look very good, the game runs very smoothly, there were hardly any bugs which is close to a miracle these days, but if they had spent even a fraction of the time they did on bug testing on actually improving the writing (the literal most important part of a narrative driven ""rpg"") maybe we wouldn't have to be having this discussion.

At the end of the day, because of the lack of real choice, I ended up hating my own character. I disliked almost all of the companions. The lore ended up being completely ruined by the end of the game. I have lost all excitement for the next Mass Effect, and unless this IP goes to a new studio, I will no longer be interested in Dragon Age as a franchise, which breaks my heart.

I have so much more to say and talk about because of my love for this property, but alas, I cannot, as I would have to spoil major sections of the game. Ultimately your choices don't amount to shit anyway until the last two hours of the game and those choices are made right then and there, not reflective of previous quests.

If you like this game, that's great. I wish I could share that opinion with you, but if you truly care about story, choice and PLAYING A ROLE in a ROLE PLAYING GAME, avoid this. It's utterly disappointing at best, and a terrible community college final project at worst.

I went from a DV relationship, two kids, 90kg living off $100pw after rent, the lowest of low self worth. But, I had lots of great mum friends who were kind and supportive. Now with that love and support, I left my ex in 2022, had therapy and so much self love and work, I'm 54kg (with the help of jujitsu), I earn over 6 figures running my own business, I live in a beautiful home, my kiddos are thriving and in therapy, I got a bunch of tattoos and basically found myself which is hard after kids. And found the most supportive and protective man in the world. I am so happy but in the process I lost all my friends, I found we mostly just talked about how hard things are and supported eachother and now things aren't hard, I was still supportive but I guess they felt I was unrelatable or something? Now I've moved to a new area and people are nice but all conversations feel like surface conversations, I've invited mums for play dates or coffee but it is still even surface conversations then.
