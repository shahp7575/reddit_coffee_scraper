After doing research, I was deciding between Gaggia Classic Pro E24 w/ the new brass boiler ($450), Bambino Plus ($500), or splurging for a Profitec Go (\~$1000). I enjoy milk drinks, light roasts, and will be making 1-2 milk drinks at a time. I'm the type where I like spending up front time dialing in a good recipe and workflow, and then just doing that same general process and not doing a huge amount of experimentation after I get it good enough the first time.

I like fiddling with coffee but not fiddling with plumbing and electronics, so I thought it'd be worth it to go up to the Profitec... based on what people were saying about the GCP it sounds like the stock machine is frustrating with temp surfing and recommended to do the gaggiuino mod (which bumps up the price probably $200), and the bambino plus had some build quality skepticism online and in YT reviews.

I started pursuing her as she was looking at me from a distance, trying to be extremely funny, and asked me for my number even though she could've contacted me on the work app. Things went on for a month. She used to get flustered when she saw me or at least that's what I thought. I agree that I asked her out really really soon, to which she replied I hate coffee but I can keep you company. This is as mixed and fucked up as it gets. I was always helping her, bending over backwards for her. The worst part is I got other chicks staring at me who were hot, which I ignore cause I wanted to chase this girl.

At this point I just started talking to her on the phone. We used to talk for at least an hour. 

One day I called her, she picked up and hung up the call and said she was busy. Later she apologized in the text that hanging up is too bad. To which I replied it's all good please do not worry, you're too sweet.

That's it. I got ghosted for this for 4 days. I still did not get the intent here. After a few days I sent her a song, again seen zoned. The next day I called her for work related stuff, she said she was on sick leave. I hung up the call and apologised and gave advice via text. She was like thank you, blah blah, I was receiving very frequent texts that day. She asked me if I was free. To which I replied give me some time as I was busy. I assumed she wanted to talk to me. Then I asked I'm free now, are you free? To which she replied with a pic of making coffee. I replied I did not understand this. She was like this is me indirectly saying I'm busy for 10 mins. This pissed me off, she initially said she didn't like coffee and she's having coffee.When I asked if I could she hesitated. When I told I was at home and not work, she agreed to talk. I called her up, I have advice about her work, mental health and everything. She was opening up to me. Then after an hour, she said she was getting a call and then hung up the phone. After that no text no call no nothing. Done.

1h1qn7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h1qn7h/interrupted_while_on_work_call/,Interrupted While On Work Call,"
I am staying with my boyfriend‚Äôs parents (for cultural purposes, they‚Äôre Indian immigrants) for Thanksgiving and needed to work for a few hours today. I‚Äôm a mental health provider and told them earlier this week and reminded them this morning. I began working in the guest room we are staying in and between calls, I asked my boyfriend if any coffee was made. He said ‚Äúno‚Äù but since I was behind, I told him I needed to get started with my next patient and couldn‚Äôt wait for it to brew. A few minutes into my video call, I heard a quiet knock at the door. I ignored it but heard it again. I excused myself from the call and it was my boyfriend with coffee and a plate of snacks. It was a very sweet gesture so I acknowledged that and didn‚Äôt express my frustration that he had interrupted my call because I understood it was coming from a good place (although he‚Äôs also a healthcare provider and should know it was rather unprofessional for me to get up mid-session for personal needs). A few minutes later, his mother tip-toed into the room without knocking, walked into the camera view across the room and got some sewing thread. I was so shocked, I just paused and asked my patient if he could hold for a brief moment, but he said that was fine and he was going to use the restroom.  His mother motioned that she was leaving and quietly left without saying anything. Although I don‚Äôt believe she intended to be rude and may not have realized I was on a video call, I was very embarrassed by the two unprofessional interruptions and messaged my boyfriend letting him know his mother came in. He immediately responded and said she was sorry but asked ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you lock the door?‚Äù I explained that it was closed and he went on to say that it was my fault for not locking it. He then told me to make the request to his parents not to enter the room if the door is closed. I was irritated that he seemed dismissive and was asking me to ask them for basic courtesy. We went back and forth but he acted as though a closed door isn‚Äôt a sign of privacy saying ‚ÄúThey don't know that means don't enter? Maybe they forgot? It is their house after all.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre their child. And I disagree that it‚Äôs my role to tell them things like ‚Äúhey, please don‚Äôt walk in when she‚Äôs working and the door is closed‚Ä¶. You are now the one being incredibly disrespectful.‚Äù
He replied saying ‚ÄúUnequivocally. I came and delivered you coffee. Take some damn responsibility for yourself. lock the damn door.‚Äù

We discussed it again tonight and he once again blamed me for not locking the door and acted as if I was stupid to think a closed door is a sign of privacy. I asked what would have happened had I been undressed and he said ‚Äúmy mom knew you were working.‚Äù He got upset saying that I should go rent a coworking office space in the future since it‚Äôs an inconvenience for me to work here in their home (that consists of two guest rooms and large living spaces).

So, today my husband and I were out with our 15 month old daughter. It was a cold windy day and we passed by a coffee shop. It was warm inside with yummy looking drip coffee, lots of open space and not too many patrons. We thought let's give it a try! (We basically never do this, maybe for good reason?) So we ordered two coffees and let our daughter out of the carrier. As is her nature, she immediately starts exploring. She just started walking about a month ago, so mostly not touching the floor with her hands at least but some of that when she falls. But she is SO friendly and curious and adventurous, and she soon starts going to the few other patrons there and waving. Mostly that is fine and most people engage excitedly with her, but then she wants to touch their things or take their food or go on their seats and gets mad when I redirect her. In the back corner of the cafe we actually run into a group of two moms with several kids, the youngest two being her age exactly. I am shocked by the juxtaposition of our children: both their kids are super calm, staying with the group, actually sitting in chairs next to their moms and snacking a little but mostly just chilling (one gets down to see us when we come over but just calmly stands there looking at us). The moms nicely offer my LO some snacks at which point she just becomes obsessed with them and even starts taking snacks from their girls' hands and grabbing for the bag...I am mortified. Not to mention that these two moms are doing it on their own, while both me and my husband can't even contain this single child. I try to direct my LO to our table to eat our snacks but this only enrages her. And she starts what I guess is a tantrum (new ish thing) going all jelly in my hands and falling back on the floor screaming.

How much of this in your opinions is just the genetics of the child vs something that can be trained? Is it a pipe dream to ever be able to calmly sit with my LO at a cafe or restaurant? Or am I doing something wrong? If I am how can I train her better? I have read hunt gather parent probably 5 times and that is the parenting style that resonates with me most but honestly I don't know if it's working or if I am doing it right.

I AM BACK! I am totally not in the least offended if you have no clue who I am or what I am talking about. A while ago, I posted some very honest and honestly diabolical perfume reviews here about fragrances that were either a very big hit or a very big miss. 

But then life got in the way, as we all know can happen sometimes and I somehow just forgot about it. I forgot the spice, the zest and the utter spike of dopamine that I get from writing these unhinged things. 

So now i'm back\~\~ but also don't keep your hopes up too high about me posting regularly, because once my dopamine factory is out of business, I might be on temporary hiatus again.

BUT, PERFUME.  
SO! I know that i'm mostly known for my hate messages here (lol) but today, today honeys, I have a love song. 

I was invited to a perfume event recently, but I sadly had to cancel last minute due to being ill. Then, after some very intense back and forth'ing with the (honestly absolutely un)kind employees, they were okay with sending me the giftbag (THAT WAS INCLUDED WITH THE TICKET ANYWAY) through the post and I had a lovely fellow perfume fan that was willing to use my discount code to pick up a fragrance in store and send it to me.

And that, that's how I met the love of my life (sorry husband, you're mostly a 6 now) Mati√®re Premi√®re - Vanilla Powder.

I was honestly doubting whether I was going to pick this one or not. I've tried, tested and loved Parisian Musc, so I know that I liked the DNA of this brand, but online reviews on Fragantica said it was nothing special at all. 

Well, I don't now who pooped in their morning coffee and changed their sense of smell, because this is gorgeous. And that's coming from someone who doesn't even like vanilla that much! I'm a sucker for Heliothrope though and this sucker is Heliothrope with an H. 

This perfume honestly makes me feel like i'm a fairy and capable of convincing society that i'm not the clumsy, foulmouthed woman that I am deep down. I would say that this is a more sophisticated (and more nuclear) version of Prada Candy. I'm not kidding, I put one spray on my shirt and I could still smell it a week later. Like, actively, in the air, not me putting my nose in it with the hope of detecting a small debris. This is truly a bang for your buck. It's insanely expensive, so I appreciate Mati√®re Premi√®re that they atleast made it good and lasting.

So, if you love a gentle, light, fluffy vanilla scent with some deepness in a none invasive way (looking at you sandalwood), then this is your girl. This scent is perfect for cosplaying that you're an elegant, minimalistic, feminine Parisian type of woman who has multiple suitors to wow, while you actually can't remember the last time that you had sex without a satisfyer or a bad written romance book by your side.

Pick it up! You will welcome me for it

Scent notes:

**- Top Notes**: Coconut Powder, Heliotrope

**- Middle Notes**: Madagascar Vanilla

**- Base Notes**: Vanilla Absolute, White Musk, Musk, Palo Santo, Lactones, Coconut

I know i may be on my 6th coffee, i was backcin the abbey today. Had to do some research...and follow up on a previous post

Aside from the stonework, even the buildings, the woodwork, it really has lasted the tests of time. Now i could go on about it until Henry VII's ghost kicks me out but i came across this little part.

Location just behind the tomb of Henry VII, walls obviously withstand many elements of weather, but here is an actual wooden floor.

At first i thought it was for wheelchair access, then realised it isnt, noting access more modern at other places.

Yet here is a piece of flooring, that has lasted through time, and thousands of people walking on it. You can only preserve wood for so long, but why have wood hear and not the marble/stone?

Has anyone else found little bits of architecture from the period that is fascinating?

Note i assume it is tudor because i doubt the Stuarts or Hanovers thought, hey lets put some wood down here.

I asked why the wood was there and not stone and no one knew...not sure if anyone else knows

In the past 2 years have I started coming out of a very serious rut. 10 years ago, I was homeless, obese, and the poster child of mental illness. When I got a place to live, it was a place of **literal** survival. I'm talking a closet full of canned food, water filters, and other prepper gear. 'Just in case'.

Today, I have a decent job (by my standards), zero debt, and I'm in the best shape of my life. I've started flirting with girls again, and they're actually reciprocating! Oh f$%\^k I need to clean up my home before I show it to someone!

My current place is a little rented 1-bedroom that I get a killer deal on. But as I think about getting better decor and making it presentable, I've realized a biiig problem.

Half of my kitchen is actually a gym. My power rack is a massive monstrosity, and its the very first thing you see when you open my door. The only furniture you can sit on is my bed. This just feels creepy. I don't want to subject anyone to that... but I also don't want to give up my rack. I love my rack! I almost owe my life to that barbell... and I kinda hate working out at a gym. I've tried, but I just never end up going.

How bad is it? Completely unacceptable?

I probably do have room to put a couple comfy chairs and a coffee table in my bedroom, if I sell some junk. But even still, I worry that it's maybe inappropriate if the only place to sit and socialize is in my bedroom.

I wanna test where I'm at, so I know at what time of day I gotta stop drinking coffee.

I actually don't drink coffee. Maybe drank 7 cups throughout my life. My mom said it was bad, and then I saw people online say it was bad. But I want to test a caffeinated reality.

Here's my makeshift plan. Just drink 4 8oz cups tomorrow in the morning, and track how I feel throughout the day. Anyone have a better idea?

For what its worth, I drank a cup 4 hours ago, and I now am as tired as I'd normally be around this time of day, with a minor headache. I assume I've mostly metabolized all the caffeine, putting me in the medium-fast or fast category. So theoretically tomorrow, in 4 hours I'd have 2 cups worth of energy, in 8 hours I'd have 1 cup worth of energy, and in 12 hours, I'd have approximately the same energy as normal. Not sure how to interpret the intensity of headaches throughout the day though.

A few hours ago, I was at a nearby McDonald‚Äôs. I ordered an iced coffee and planned to pay using Maya QR since I didn‚Äôt have cash on me.

The QR code popped up: 73 pesos. I took out my phone to pay, but the app froze‚Äîat the worst possible moment. I tried a few times, but no luck. Meanwhile, my coffee sat on the counter, and I was stuck in a pretty awkward situation.

Then, the person behind me, an incredibly tall Black woman (seriously, she was very tall), noticed my predicament. Without hesitation, she offered to pay for me and did so before I could even fully protest. I kept saying, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is so embarrassing,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou really didn‚Äôt have to,‚Äù but all she said with a radiant smile was:

‚ÄúNo problem, someone helped me once, and I‚Äôm helping you.‚Äù

So long story short, diagnosed with sleep apnea a long time ago, got a CPAP, been using it regularly now for months. My only issue is that, I can't seem to get restful sleep still. We tried adjusting the pressure. Tried just a nasal mask. Tried sleep medicine even. Tape for over the mouth to prevent swallowing air. I still wake up a couple times a night at the very least, and no matter what I do I never feel rested and need a nap in the afternoon. I've tried various sleep medicine, but for some reason my body can't metabolize it quickly. What should be long acting stays for around 20-24 hours in my body, and even though now I have been prescribed generic ambien, I still wake up, and the grogginess stays for around 12-14 hours. Even at 2.5mg, which sadly only helps me fall asleep a little bit but I still wake up several times.

I have more appointments with my sleep doctor, but they can't figure anything out. I tried less caffeine, no drinking after 6, melatonin, but I am just unsure what I can do so I can get a restful night of sleep. All my life I always felt incredibly tired, and was hoping with better sleep I could finally have the energy to move around for at least half the day or figure out if its not sleep apnea related and something else. My only concern is, if its not sleep apnea related, they will have a hard time figuring that out since I can't get any deep sleep.

Anyone go through anything similar? Any suggestions? I was recommended to exercise more but I just do not have the energy to move, I am so tired, takes me over an hour to get out of bed. This evening I even downed two cups of coffee and did not notice a difference, it seems that only if I take shots of espresso did it do anything, but I felt horrible so I stopped (even though it worked in keeping me awake).

From choosing the ideal [round rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/textiles/rugs/round-rugs) to accentuate your living room to installing a stunning [black pendant light](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) for modern sophistication, every choice contributes to your home‚Äôs overall ambiance. Here‚Äôs a guide to help you choose the perfect furniture for every room.

**Living Room: Balance Comfort and Style**

The living room is where relaxation meets social interaction. Opt for a comfortable sofa that complements your layout‚Äîsectionals for larger spaces or sleek loveseats for smaller rooms. Incorporate accent chairs or ottomans for additional seating.

To tie the space together, consider adding a **round rug**. Its circular design softens the room‚Äôs angles and creates a cozy focal point. Pair it with a coffee table that matches your room‚Äôs style, whether mid-century modern, rustic, or contemporary.

**Kitchen: Functionality Meets Flair**

The kitchen is the heart of your home, so every piece of furniture should be practical yet stylish. For small kitchens, choose slim-profile stools or multifunctional islands. In open-plan kitchens, a dining set can double as a workspace.

Lighting plays a significant role here. Opt for [hanging lights for kitchen](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) that provide focused illumination over counters or islands. **Black pendant lights** make a bold statement, blending effortlessly with both modern and industrial interiors. These lighting choices enhance the room‚Äôs functionality while elevating its aesthetic.

**Dining Room: Focus on Versatility**

Your dining room furniture should adapt to casual meals and formal gatherings. Look for extendable dining tables that accommodate varying numbers of guests. Upholstered chairs offer comfort for long dinners, while wooden designs lend timeless elegance.

Add layered lighting for depth, including a central pendant or chandelier and supplementary wall sconces or table lamps. You can match the dining space‚Äôs lighting with your **kitchen hanging lights** for a cohesive look.

**Bedroom: A Personal Retreat**

Your bedroom should exude tranquility. Start with a bedframe that suits your style‚Äîsleek and modern, or upholstered and luxurious. Complement it with nightstands and dressers that offer ample storage.

Choose a soft **round rug** to place under your bed or in front of a seating area for added comfort and visual appeal. This touch of softness transforms the space into a true retreat.

**Outdoor Spaces: Extend Your Living Area**

Your outdoor furniture should be durable and inviting. Look for weather-resistant materials like teak or aluminum for your patio or garden. Modular seating can adapt to gatherings of any size, while side tables and planters complete the space.

Lighting matters here, too. Outdoor **hanging lights for kitchens** or bar areas bring a touch of warmth, creating a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor spaces.

**Key Tips for Every Room**

* **Function First**: Prioritize pieces that enhance each room's purpose.

My ex (30m) broke up with me 8 days ago. It was out of the blue because we were working on our relationship. He said he‚Äòs not happy, he wants no relationship with me. He said he doesn‚Äôt have any affection or attraction towards me. He felt like I was replacing him with new friends (while I was going out twice, he was replacing me and planned his weekends with his new hobby and friends for more than a month) 
I was shocked, I cried a lot and begged. But he didn‚Äôt want to try again. He said, I was selfish because I wanted to try to work things out and now he wanted to be selfish and ended the relationship. 

We were living only for three months together. He said he had this uncertain feeling about us before we moved in together. I was flabbergasted because he never told me that. I wouldn‚Äôt moved in with him at all. 
In his mind he told me all about his feelings but he never really communicated. I was always asking him if he‚Äôs okay. And he would say he‚Äòs okay, everything‚Äôs been good. 

Well, he broke up 8 days ago. Last Friday I moved out, living with my mom now. I was crying the whole time, while knowing he was out, having fun (he told me before he had plans on the weekend and I‚Äòve watched his instagram story) 
Friday we saw each other before I went to my mum. I‚Äòve asked him if I can have a present I‚Äòve got him: it was a selfmade notebook, where I wrote my view of our dates, my feelings about him; I drawed each other and yeah, it showed how deeply I am in love with him. I thought he didn‚Äôt want it because it‚Äôs something emotional and he told me earlier he doesn‚Äôt have any attraction or connection towards me. But he didn‚Äôt let me have this book. It‚Äôs fair because it was a present but I don‚Äôt get why he wants it. He‚Äôs not emotional attached. He always says he‚Äòs a logical and rational person. I also found a picture of us and put it on our desk, so I can take it with me when I pick up all the rest of my stuff. 
On this Tuesday my brother helped me to get most of my stuff. I texted my ex about this. While I was in our old apartment, I noticed the picture was gone. I sneaked into his office and found it in his cabinet. I left it there. 

I couldn‚Äôt understand why he told me he need to make a hard cut and saying he doesn‚Äôt feel a thing, but kept emotional belongings. 


We wrote each other only about organisational stuff, like the apartment. 
While we were breaking up I‚Äòve asked him to stay friends (stupid, I know). He agreed to it, because he cherish me as a good friend. He said I‚Äòm like a partner in crime but there‚Äôs no romantic feelings towards me. Hurtes like hell to hear that. 


I was keeping low contact. Yesterday he messaged me, asking if I want to meet up today for a coffee. I wasn‚Äôt sure about that because why would he ask? I asked him if I can answer tomorrow and he said okay. Half an our he texted me again like ‚ÄûOh my friend would be with me too, fyi‚Äú 
I felt so stupid. I wrote ‚ÄûHave fun together‚Äú and after he thanked me, I couldn‚Äôt resist the urge to ask, why he would invite me to a coffee while he had some plans with others. His response was ‚Äûmaybe you wanted to join ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äú He told me he‚Äòs meeting his friend in the city because they want to go bouldering with a group of new people. He explained his friend would come at 4pm but he‚Äòs in the city at 3pm and he thought I would like to get a coffee. 
I‚Äòve read his message but didn‚Äôt respond. 

I felt so stupid. Of course I had some little hope, he may want to talk to me. 
But now I see, he‚Äòs just using me. 

I even wrote ChatGPT about my break up üò≠ I wanted to know if I‚Äòm only telling myself he gave me mixed signals or if I‚Äôm just crazy. 

I feel like he‚Äòs a DA. Like he can‚Äôt communicate at all and he just choose the easy way out. 

Now I start No Contact. I realise I need to take care of myself much more and shouldn‚Äôt wait for him. 

I didn‚Äôt block him, but I‚Äòve muted him anywhere so I wouldn‚Äôt look at his social media.

I wanna do no contact in small steps. My goal now is no contact for 5 days. After that I won‚Äôt message him and set up a new goal (like ten days). My ultimate goal would be 30 days no contact. 

I‚Äòm still hurt and trying to find a way to heal. 

A part of me still wants him to reach out and realise how his actions destroyed what we had. But I read about dumpers high and I guess he‚Äòs at the moment there and he doesn‚Äôt give a shit about me. ",1,1732776306.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

This is my aunt's first dog, and any advice people try to give her (I know people don't like shock collars, but they're very effective training tools. The shock doesn't have to hurt, it can just be annoying), but she insists that her way (coddling) is fine when it's clear that it isn't. At this point, punishing bad behaviour via a shock collar (marking, nipping young children who have food, getting into trash, and getting up on tables) while rewarding good behaviour (not begging, going to his cage quietly, staying off the table, staying out of the trash, not biting, and listening to commands) seems like the only way since he's a middle aged dog (he's a bichon mix). I feel like I should press how dangerous this situation is for the dog on my aunt, explain that the dog can poison himself again or suffer a head/spinal injury from a fall, and that with it being Thanksgiving, the nearest emergency vets in the area that'll be open are over 20 minutes away (and likely understaffed due to the holiday), which could be time the dog doesn't have if he poisons himself or suffers an injury from falling.

Whether you have a sprawling garden or a compact balcony, the right furniture and decor can make all the difference. From [rattan outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan) to charming accessories, here are some practical tips to design the perfect outdoor haven.

# 1. Choose Comfortable Seating

The foundation of any outdoor living room is its seating. Opt for *rattan outdoor furniture* sets that combine durability with a natural aesthetic. Sofas and armchairs with plush, weather-resistant cushions offer a blend of comfort and elegance, making them perfect for long conversations or quiet evenings under the stars.

# 2. Incorporate a Stylish Coffee Table

A central piece like a *rattan coffee table* anchors the space while adding functionality. Use it to display potted plants, serve refreshments, or stack outdoor-friendly books and magazines. The natural texture of rattan complements both modern and bohemian themes, creating a warm and inviting vibe.

# 3. Define the Space with Rugs and Lighting

To give your outdoor living room a cozy, indoor feel, layer the space with outdoor rugs. Choose patterns that resonate with your style‚Äîbold stripes for a contemporary look or intricate designs for a touch of sophistication. Add string lights, lanterns, or solar-powered lamps to create a magical ambiance in the evening.

# 4. Select Functional and Stylish Storage

Outdoor living spaces benefit from smart storage solutions. Multifunctional [outdoor garden furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) pieces like benches with hidden storage or side tables with compartments help keep cushions, throws, and other essentials organized without compromising on style.

# 5. Add Greenery and Natural Elements

Enhance your outdoor retreat with lush greenery. Potted plants, hanging baskets, or vertical gardens infuse life into the space while complementing the natural charm of *rattan outdoor furniture*. Pair your plants with ceramic or woven planters for added texture.

# 6. Layer with Textiles for Warmth

Throws, pillows, and outdoor curtains are essential for making your space feel snug. Opt for textiles in earthy tones or vibrant patterns to contrast with the neutral hues of [outdoor furniture](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/outdoor-furniture). Weather-resistant materials ensure longevity while keeping the space low-maintenance.

# 7. Create Zones for Functionality

Divide your outdoor living room into distinct areas for lounging, dining, or entertaining. A [rattan coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-coffee-tables) paired with a sofa makes a cozy lounging zone, while a compact dining set transforms a corner into a functional dining space.

# 8. Embrace Weather-Friendly Decor

Durability is key when selecting decor for outdoor use. Ceramic vases, weatherproof sculptures, and lanterns are excellent choices to add personality without worrying about wear and tear.

# 9. Personalize Your Space

Make your outdoor living room feel like home by incorporating personal touches. Display art pieces, add a bookshelf for your favorite reads, or use decorative trays on your *rattan coffee table* for a chic yet practical finish.

# 10. Invest in High-Quality Outdoor Furniture

Finally, invest in durable, weather-resistant *outdoor garden furniture* to ensure your space remains inviting year-round. Look for materials like teak, aluminum, or synthetic rattan, which withstand varying weather conditions without losing their charm.

By incorporating these tips, you can create a cozy outdoor living room that‚Äôs perfect for relaxing, entertaining, or simply soaking in the beauty of nature. With thoughtfully chosen pieces like *rattan outdoor furniture* and decor elements, your outdoor space can become a seamless extension of your home.",1,1732775810.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

It's also light, refreshing, minimally bitter, and extracts the vibrant/fruity aspect of the coffee quite well. So it does capture a lot of the complexity while not really including unpleasant aftertastes. Also because it's not hot, the flavors tend to be clearer to the palate as well as preservation of delicate flavors that will otherwise be destroyed by the heat. Mix it with some milk to add extra body and flavor and it's a very satisfying cup.

I also did an experiment where I brewed the remnants of the cold brew beans (20 hours in the refrigerator). Since I used my pour over v60 to filter the cold brew and it did form a very flat bed after all the water has been strained and settled, it would be not much work to try it out and so I did. I assumed since the cold brew didn't involve heat then maybe I can still get a good drinking experience from pouring hot water since I used almost double the amount of beans for the same 1 cup. The cup looks like a decent cup of coffee at first glance but it doesn't have any more complexity left. The coffee has some body of brewed coffee but there was no hints of vibrant/fruity notes at all. So I figured the cold brew did well in getting almost all the complexity out of the beans.

Since you use more coffee beans to make cold brew it would be more costly than normal so I want to look for cost effective alternatives that can be great with cold brews. I prefer light/medium roasts that are more vibrant/fruity.",1,1732775738.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False

Throwaway because I'm afraid that someone knows my account and realises that this is how I feel.
On the outside , I have the perfect life. Great friends, great family. Sociable. Lost 24 kg this year only. 
I started losing weight when my ex left , after 7 years. We kinda lost our way and he decided to end things. I loved him and gave him everything. I was happy, and then one day I was miserable, alone and back at my parents house. 
After that I tried to live. Like , actually live : go to concerts , enjoy time with my friends and family , travel , everything I could imagine. Also , therapy. 
I met someone from my past that wanted something casual. Somewhere along the way I found out that I was not made for casual, so I decided to stop meeting with him about 3 months ago. We were supposed to meet today for coffee and he just didn't show up , didn't text (I didn't text either , I'd like to have at least some dignity). 

All of this is killing me slowly. I miss intimacy. I miss having someone to share the little things in life. The little things that no one usually cares about. I miss going to bed together , making lunch. I miss having someone to hug whenever I want to. I miss having someone who cares. I don't mean that my friends or family don't care but I need something more. And I have no idea where to find it. And it's like a hole inside me that is eating me up every single day. And I don't wanna keep living like this. I wanna be happy. And I have no clue what to do because it feels frivolous to say that I'm unhappy to the bones because I don't have a boyfriend. Even saying this feels pathetic. But unfortunately , that's the truth.

It started when there was a brief period of pretty poor sleep, and an over consumption of caffeine, plus stress presumably. I continued having panic attacks even after quitting caffeine, but it was easier to manage and wasn't so often. I was eventually prescribed Zoloft 50mg a day, but it made me feel weird the first two times I took it, so I quit. That was about a week ago, and that's also when I slowly started to feel better and didn't have panic attacks at all really (I have bad health anxiety though, so I obsess over my body too much which causes some general unease, but never any panic attacks, and I also get obsessive thoughts about death), and I was generally feeling much better. And this was about a week ago since I had my last panic episode. Now, today, was a slightly special occasion, I was out with my family and nieces seeing some Christmas attractions, and I decided that I've felt good enough for long enough to buy a coffee. Like I said, I have genera anxiety, and today I was feeling slightly odd, but again mostly decent. However, once I had the coffee, I slowly began to feel odd, until a few hours later I started to feel a lot worse, and my nieces are toddlers so they're pretty loud, and so is my family in general, so during dinner I started to get overstimulated, and continued to feel weird. It ebbed and flowed, but got better. My panics are usually about the fear of passing out of just like collapsing, so I get some headaches, and some lightheadedness/dizziness but the degree is so little that it feels like just a manifestation of panic. I eventually felt alright, but once I got home I started having a shortness of breath, which triggered my panic. Anyway, the details of all this is irrelevant but I rant a lot. Does anyone else get panic attacks from caffeine, even if it's hours later? If you already experience panic/anxiety attacks, does caffeine exacerbate it? I don't know why this has happened because before I basically lived off of caffeine, but ever since I started having panic attacks if seems to only worsen things. ",4,1732775329.0,DAE,5,1.0,False

1h1pr9t,https://i.redd.it/effj9tbj6l3e1.png,Did Anyone Try This Blasphemy? Ice-Drip Coffee Experiment with a V60 ,"today I decided to experiment with my V60 and create a unique ice-drip coffee. Sharing my recipe, process, and thoughts‚Äîcurious to hear your feedback or any tweaks you‚Äôd suggest!

The Recipe
Coffee Grind: Medium-fine (20g)
Bloom: 50ml hot water at 92¬∞C, let it sit for 40 seconds.
Ice: 200g directly on top of the bloomed coffee grounds.

The Process

After the bloom phase, I carefully added the ice cubes on top of the coffee grounds. The idea was to allow the ice to slowly melt, creating a super slow-drip extraction process. Essentially, I sat there did my remaining work and then waiting...and waiting...for what felt like an eternity as the ice gradually melted and dripped down into my container. üòÖ

Observations

1. Pacing: This method is not for the impatient. It‚Äôs a meditative process where you just watch and let gravity do its thing.

2. Flavor: The final brew was smoother than I expected, with pronounced fruity and floral notes that I suspect came from the ultra-slow extraction. There was almost no bitterness, and the cold melt water helped preserve the delicate coffee flavors.

I know this is definitely not an everyday coffee-brewing method, but it‚Äôs fun to try if you want to experiment with flavors and don‚Äôt mind waiting. Next time, I might tweak the grind size or ice to coffee ratio. 

Would love to hear your thoughts! Have you ever tried a similar approach, or do you have a favorite experimental V60 recipe? Drop your ideas/suggestions below.

Cheers,
A very caffeinated (and patient) coffee enthusiast ‚òï.
