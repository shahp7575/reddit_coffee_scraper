1hqs58t,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1hqs58t/the_juliet_of_autumns_end/,The Juliet of Autumn’s End,"As the waning autumn draws near,  
I dream of flying to Ethiopia,  
to become a Romeo to someone—  
just one fleeting soul.

The shepherd, seeking his lost goats,  
sings a tune of rediscovery,  
calling forth a woman,  
her aroma rich as Arabica beans,  
her essence steeped in coffee’s allure.

Beneath the blazing sun  
of the Abyssinian highlands,  
she stands, shaped by primal terracotta,  
a masterpiece of earthen beauty,  
my Juliet of this golden season.

  
ps.

Originally, I was going to call it November's Juliet, but I fixed it because I thought it would be very controversial as a political correctness issue...



가을의 줄리엣.

가을이 끝나갈 무렵이면

에티오피아로 날아가

나는 누군가 한 명의

로미오가 되고 싶다.

염소 찾아온 목동의

새삼스런 지저귐은

아라비카 커피 원두

아로마 향기 그윽한

여인을 부르짖는다.

아비시니아 고원의

뜨거운 햇빛 아래

원초의 테라코타

아름답게 빚어진

I’ve also read that eating right is more important working out but I don’t know how to cook anything haha. I eat out everyday or eat microwave food and drink a ridiculous amount of coffee. So essentially I’m looking for somebody to craft me up some sort of simple meal plan and lil workout routine haha. I’m just trying to establish some good habits and get into better shape heading into my 30s. I don’t want to quit my outdoor hobbies cause life got the best of me and I let it make me fat.

I’m fairly new to espresso making, and new to the Dedica (having used Breville Roma and Bambino in the past).  Using the default pressurized baskets and store bought ground coffee in a can, I get almost no crema and fairly bitter coffee using the default settings. 

  
With my old Breville and pressurized baskets, I could always get some decent crema even with store bought pre-ground coffee. It was almost impossible to screw up.  I’m wondering if the Dedica requires a more attentive preparation even with the pressurized baskets - more precise amount of coffee, fresher coffee, more or less temping pressure?  

Thanks for your help!

1hqrx9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hqrx9l/xbloom_studio/,XBloom Studio ,"I bought the XBloom Studio for my sister for Xmas. Besides the app being a little buggy currently (they’re STILL working on it), and only getting one cup at a time, she really likes it. She says the coffee is fantastic. She loves using the tap card, but thinks that the pods are too expensive. They have a good deal on their dark roast pods with a subscription ($1 per pod), but she likes light roasts, and those are expensive. She mostly uses her own beans in the machine instead of the pods. 

They just updated the app/machine to be able to save your own “recipes” so that you don’t have to fiddle with the settings every time when brewing from your own beans. Once you’ve got the settings dialed in, you just save them under a name, and can access that from the app or straight on the machine when brewing, which is much faster. Almost as fast as a tap card. 

She has a small kitchen, so not needing a scale and a separate grinder is a plus, and she likes the color of the white one. She says it looks very upscale. I find it super annoying that it doesn’t come with the white brewing cup though.  

Anywho, she likes the ease of use, easy cleaning, and says the coffee is delicious. 
If you’re on the fence, the Flex Program seems super cool! It’s only $30 a month to basically “rent” the machine to try it out.

Does anyone else have a recent review? The ones I've seen are all from like 6 months ago. I wish they'd handle the app better, but you can access everything directly on the machine too. Just not as easily. I hope it catches on and someone else makes cheaper pods. I also heard something about their Discord server having recipes?

These almond butter filled pretzels that I really like and have often taste gross. Coffee, which I LOVE, doesn't really taste like much. Even with flavored creamer it's still kinda blah. A cherry ginger ale that I drink regularly tastes spicy and like medicine. It's weird!

1hqrvnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hqrvnb/flaky_date_ive_decided_to_ghost_their_messages/,Flaky date I’ve decided to ghost their messages,"I started dating someone a couple months ago. We met on a dating app and then quickly started whatsapping.

So far we’ve only been on two actual dates: first time not too long just for a couple of drinks, and the second time we spent a bit longer having something to eat and a coffee afterwards.

Both dates I went to give a kiss as we left before we got in our cars, but she didn’t reciprocate so I just gave a kiss on the cheek instead.

We’ve been texting a fair bit and some sexting. 

The problem is that we both live at our parents currently, albeit temporarily. I have a new job starting soon and plan to move out again into my own place in the next couple months. The talk all along has been that it will be better once I move out and she can come round and we will have the freedom of doing what we want rather than forking out for a hotel room.

We had planned a few more dates the past month but something kept coming up and she cancelled the day before each time. First it was work overload, then it was coming down with a cold. I said fine each time, no problem we can take a rain check.

My folks went away last weekend so I had a free house for a couple of nights. I mentioned this on the Thursday and asked if she wanted to come round Friday or Saturday. She said she was meeting a friend Friday, and going out all day Saturday with other friends and staying over somewhere. She said she would see on the Friday how late it gets with her friend and possibly come to mine afterward. I said yeah that would be great if she can make time. 

Anyway, so Friday she messages early on to say that she might come round later but it’s getting misty outside which is putting her off driving. I said if you’re concerned about driving in the fog I will come and get you and drop you off. She said she will let me know. I was optimistically hoping she would make time to come round that evening as I started to prepare myself and plan the evening - but then I get the text some time around 8pm saying it looks like they’re going to be having a late one and can we reschedule and meet up for a coffee on Monday. I said fine let me think about it and I’ll let you know.

I had a message on Sunday saying how was my weekend, and then a message on Monday saying she thought we were going to meet up today. I haven’t responded to either. Just feel like I don’t want to meet up for coffee or another drink date. For me the opportunity was there to progress the relationship physically and she chose not to take it for whatever reason.

Am I right to take the non confrontational approach by ghosting her messages, and moving on, rather than expressing via text how I feel about things?

For the record, I don’t have any other friends or romantic interests lined up right now, which is why I’ve been so patient with this one.

1hqrvmg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqrvmg,Map of Rokugan Fine Art Print Review,"This review is for those considering the Map of Rokugan fine art print. For comparison, I have attached in order: 1) Fine Art Print 2) Poster Book print 3) Beginner Box poster. 4) All three adjacent for size comparison. 

Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase. The paper is a nice stock, image is clear, and the gold leaf lettering starting ""Legend of the Five Rings"" is a very nice touch. I would say that the size is about right, any larger and I'd say it leaves that ""classy"" size and enters something a bit too ostentatious. It's a bit larger than the Beginner Game map, but here you obviously don't have to deal with all the creases. 

You might be asking yourself: Should I get the fine art print or just buy the poster book for the map?

Answer: Get the art print. In my opinion the poster book maps, while great, are too much on the smaller side to appreciate unless you get up close. I almost think the Poster Book is a better coffee table book (I'll review the poster book and the proper coffee table book, Rokugan: Art of L5R, at a later time).",3,1735691684.0,l5r,0,1.0,False

Welcome to our Monthly Friendship Thread, where childfree Indians can connect and build friendships. Whether you're looking for friends in your city or online, this is the place to be!

You can also connect more organically in [CFI's only official chat channel](https://chat.reddit.com/room/!QjYaQOe1QEW4oYdhE8OxMg%3Areddit.com)—already home to over 1,800 members! Struggling to join? Shoot a DM to any mod.

*Processing gif b668qgdhaqvd1...*

A Few Things to Note:

1. **No CF4CF**: 'CFI Friendships' threads are for those seeking only platonic friends, either IRL or online. This is not the place to seek romantic interests; for that, you can create CF4CF posts on Sundays instead. If you spot any lovebirds in the wrong nest, feel free to give us a heads-up! **Stay Safe!** Use common sense and caution when talking to any stranger online.

1. **DM Etiquette:** By commenting here, you agree to be open to DMs from those seeking CFI friends (strictly platonic, unless you also post a CF4CF). Unsolicited dating or creepy messages will lead to a ban and a report to Reddit admins.
2. **Share About Yourself:** Help others get to know you better. Share your age, hobbies, city, gender (though our TwoX comrades might want to be cautious due to unsolicited attention). 
3. **Posting Flexibility:** Feel free to create posts outside of this thread to seek childfree Indian friends - use our new post flair 'CFI Friendships'. The CF4CF rules don’t apply to friendship seekers, so you can post any day, in any format, as long as you follow the other rules of CFI (see the sidebar for rules).
4. **City-Based Groups:** There are various city-based CF groups (none affiliated with this subreddit) on Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, or Facebook. Give those a try too!
5. **Meetups:** We encourage you to join or host a city-wide CF meetup if you can.

Examples:

* *""Hey CFI, It's Keanu here (yes, the one and only), dodging diapers like I dodge bullets in The Matrix. Living in Mumbai these days and looking for pals to ride motorcycles with or discuss philosophy over coffee. Drop a DM if you're into low-key hangouts and high-key debates!""* 
* *""Greetings, CFI! Bruce here from Gotham. By night, I fight crime; by day, I'm just your average billionaire. Into tech, martial arts, and nocturnal expeditions. Seeking fellow night owls who appreciate justice, complex gadgets, and the occasional brooding on rooftops. If you're up for discussing philosophy or the ethics of vigilante justice over coffee, let's connect over DM.""*
* *""Hello CFI! It's Vidya Balan here, loving life and breaking stereotypes one role at a time. I'm all about deep conversations and meaningful connections, but for now, I'm keeping things virtual.

The lighthouse. The Widow's Tooth, some of the old-timers called it. And she’d earned it, they said. More storms rolled over that rock than you’ve had hot dinners. Old timers used to say the place was cursed, that the souls of shipwrecked sailors was trapped in the lantern room, forever watchin’ for a shore they could never reach. Just stories, mostly. Keeps the tourists interested though.

Worked that light for twelve years, I did. Seen every kind of weather the Pacific could throw, every kind of boat that dared to come close. You learn to read the water out there, know the sound of a trawler from a sailboat a mile off. Seen things you wouldn’t believe, mostly just the ocean bein’ the ocean, mind you. But this… this was different.

It was a night just like any other in late fall. The kind where the wind howled like a banshee lost in a barrel, and the waves crashed high enough to spit water right up onto the lantern room. Couldn’t see nothin’ but white fury out there. Radar was spittin’ and cracklin’, pickin’ up nothin’ but the storm itself, and I figgered that was that. You get used to the loneliness out there, the constant roar of the sea your only company. You settle into a rhythm, checkin’ the lamp, the gauges, makin’ sure Widow's Tooth was doin’ her job, warnin’ folks away from the teeth of that rock.

Then, clear as a bell over the roar, I heard it. A knock. Not a bang from the wind, nothin’ like that. A proper knock. Like someone standin’ there, polite as you please, in the middle of Armageddon.

Figgered it was the wind playin’ tricks, but then it came again. Three sharp raps. No boat coulda made it close that night without me seein’ it, hearin’ it. And even if they did… they’d be clingin’ to life, not standin’ there knockin’ like they was expectin’ tea and biscuits.

I went down the windin’ stairs, heart thumpin’ a little faster than usual. Bolted the heavy door open, and there they was. A fella, his wife, and two young’uns, huddled together. Seemed normal enough at first glance. Except… they was dry. Bone dry. Like they’d just stepped out of their parlor on a sunny afternoon. Their clothes, looked like wool, but felt… papery, almost. Rain usually soaks things. And their hair, the rain shoulda plastered it to their heads, but it was dry, like it hadn't even been near water.

“Lost, are you?” I asked, the wind tryin’ to rip the words from my mouth.

The fella, he had a thin mustache and a nervous look, just nodded. “Storm caught us out,” he said, his voice barely a whisper against the wind. The wife, she had her arm around a little girl, maybe six or seven, and the boy, a couple years older, was holdin’ onto his daddy’s coat.

“No boat,” I said, lookin’ past ‘em into the storm. “Ain’t seen no boats all night.”

The fella just shrugged, a weak little shrug that didn’t explain nothin’. I wasn’t born yesterday. You don’t just appear on a rock in the middle of the ocean during a gale.

“Come on in,” I said, more out of habit than anything. Couldn’t leave folks out in that.

They stepped inside, and the wind seemed to sigh now that the door was shut. They dripped nothin’ on the floor. Not a single drop. I’d just mopped the floor that afternoon, the linoleum still a bit slick. They stepped inside, and nothin'. Not a bead of water. I remember thinkin' I needed to check the desiccant in the lamp housing later, keep the moisture out. But that dryness… it wasn't right.

“Coffee?” I offered, pointin’ to the pot always brewin’ on the stove. Strong enough to float a damn horseshoe.

They nodded, still quiet. The young’uns, a boy and a girl, they didn’t say nothin’, just stood there, clingin’ to their mama’s skirts.

It was the way they looked at you though. The wife, she’d smile, a real polite smile, but her eyes… her eyes would drift off, lookin’ past you, like she was seein’ somethin’ on the wall behind you that wasn’t there. The fella, he mostly kept his head down, but every now and then, he’d glance up, a quick, dartin’ look, then back down again. Like he was expectin’ somethin’ to jump out.

And then there was the peekin’. The little girl, she’d stand in a doorway, just out of sight, just her eyes peekin’ around the jamb, starin’ at you with that same fixed smile. Or the husband, he’d be sittin’ by the fire, but you’d catch him lookin’ over his shoulder, starin’ at the shadows in the corner. The firelight dancin’ on the walls, makin’ shapes.

They didn’t act like they’d just escaped a watery grave. No shiverin’, no cryin’, nothin’. Just… there. And they stayed dry. Even sittin’ by the fire, their clothes didn’t steam, didn’t even look damp. It was unnatural.

Started with a glance here and there, easy enough to miss. But then it got… coordinated. Like they'd rehearsed it. I'd be jawin' with the fella about the wind, tryin' to act normal, and then, all at once, the wife and kids, they'd all turn. Every one of 'em, eyes locked on you for a heartbeat. Then, just as sudden, they'd snap away, lookin' at the floor or the wall, like nothin' happened. Creeped me right out. Like I'd missed somethin', like they knew somethin' I didn't. Made the hairs on my neck prickle, I tell you what.

Once, I went up to check the lamp, hearin' the beam whir and swing out over the black water. When I came back down, they was all just… standin' there, smack-dab in the middle of the room, heads tilted back, gazin' up at the ceilin'. Just starin'. Ceilin's just a ceilin', ain't nothin' special about it. But they was lookin' like they seen somethin' I couldn't. Cleared my throat, and their heads snapped down quick, like they was pulled by a string. Smilin'. That same damn smile that didn't reach their eyes. Like nothin' was amiss.

My mind was tryin’ to make sense of it, tellin’ me I was just tired, seein’ things. But that feelin’… that cold knot in your gut… that don’t lie. I’d seen things out on the water, things you can’t explain, but this was different. This felt… wrong.

It hit me when I saw the little girl walk right through a puddle of seawater on the floor by the door. Didn’t even ripple the water. That’s when the cold really set in. That’s when I knew somethin’ wasn’t right, somethin’ was deeply, terribly wrong.

I’d been watchin’ the wife help the little boy with his coat. Just a normal thing, a mother and her son. But the way she smiled down at him… it was too wide, too fixed. And his eyes… they was lookin’ past her, lookin’ right through her. And somethin’ just clicked. That wasn’t her. And them weren’t her children. Not anymore, anyway.

Come mornin', the wind was done howlin', the sea was almost... polite. Sun shinin' like butter wouldn't melt. They were gone. Just... gone. I stood there, feelin' the silence pressin' in. My gaze kept driftin' back to the door. Solid. And the bolt. That thick brass bolt, still in place. I know that bolt. Know it like I know my own hands. You gotta be here, on this side, to slide it across. Feel the click as it locks. There's no reachin' it from out there. No way. So how...? No wet tracks. Nothin' disturbed. Just the memory of their faces... and that damn bolt.

Never saw ‘em again. Never heard nothin’ ‘bout a missin’ family. The sea keeps its secrets, and sometimes, it spits things back that ain’t what they used to be.

So, if you’re ever caught out in a storm, and someone comes to your door lookin’ for shelter… look real close. Especially if they’re dry as a bone when they shouldn’t be. And if they start starin’ at the corners of the room, smilin’ that empty smile… bolt the door. Let the storm rage. Because sometimes, the sea ain’t the only thing that washes ashore. It brings other things too. Things you don't want to see. Things that ain't natural.",3,1735691158.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1hqrprf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hqrprf/i_used_to_be_an_absolute_creep/,I used to be an absolute creep,"Last year, when I turned 18, I decided now was finally the time to start dating. I just graduated from high school, was off to an ivy league from my town of 50, had half my credits done from doing classes at a community college, and had gotten some scholarships. I was beloved in my school as the the funny, chill weird guy. I had national trophies from scholar tournaments. I had done almost a thousand hours in volunteer work. I felt the best I ever have been.

So I thought, why not try dating? I ended up using both dating apps and reddit. Only problem: I had no social skills. Despite me being beloved in my high school, I was basically asexual until I was 18. So I got hit by libido hard, and with my autism undiagnosed, I didn't know why I couldn't connect with anyone outside of my high school (who I literally grew up with, we all went to the same preschool). So I ended up getting catfished. Once I got to college, I tried my luck there. I got a few matches, but all of them always ended up blocking me, either because I moved too fast, or was too strong, or had no idea how to flirt (still don't). My friend tried to set me up with someone, but she ended up blocking me because I was ""too strong"" and i need to ""find someone to match my energy"". I, of course, responded to this by diving into the manosphere.

I hate myself for what I became. I still tried hooking up with girls, often becoming their friends first before popping the question of coffee. One girl took the rejection well, but I said i cried to her pfp as a joke, so I creeped her out. Another, a girl from my class who super liked me on tinder, said she wasn't ready to date but got a bf next week. I, of course, thought she was serious about no dating, so I got upset because she ""lied"" which of course creeped her and her roommate, who I was good friends with, out. Finally, any friend I made I ended up venting to about my relationship issues and mental health. It lead to every friend I made, every group I was apart of, kicking me out for mentally being too much.

Its over a year later now. I went down this hole until recently. I started paying girls to send me n3des and be ""FWBS"" which became a black hole for my money. I kept crashing my car in an attempt to off myself, so my parents stop trusting me with anything but a phone and a laptop. I got terrible grades. And of course, I creeped people out. It was who I was. I was so desperate to get laid and get a gf it consumed me, and became a black hole of happiness. I was nothing. I was an ugly audhd freak who deserved to be alone.

I'm finally on therapy and taking my medication (I stopped taking my SSRIs and ADHD meds because ""only a pu33y solves shit with drugs"" and ""you just need to work out"") and I realized what a god awful person I was. I was attention seeking, creepy, sometimes catfishing asshole who used other people to boost my own ego. I genuinely despise myself and what I've done, and how I used people away who tried to help me, on the internet and irl.

I've tried to make amends with as many people as I've can. I've sent out heartfelt apologizes to as many people as possible. Of course some bridges can't be rebuilt, and I understand that. I fucked up and these are the consequences. I just wish I had realized this sooner, maybe I wouldn't have lost so many good friends. I'm sorry, to everyone I ever hurt. I'm truly sorry.",1,1735691123.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

On my 18th birthday, I finally understand why.","On my eighth birthday, a shadow strode into my house and shot me and my family dead. 

I remember it vividly, every detail, every angle, etched and stained into my memory.

I sat very still with my knees to my chest, my gaze fixed on my siblings.

Lily and PJ looked like they were sleeping, and I could almost believe it.

I didn’t look at the shadow.

From the comfort of my knees, I waited for my brother to lift his head.

But his body was so limp, so still, every part of him faltering. My sister’s head was nestled on his shoulder, thick beads of red running down her face.

*They're just sleeping.*

I could tell myself they were—as long as I didn’t look at the splatter of scarlet staining the back of the couch and pooling at their feet.

*BANG.*

Mom’s body dropped to the ground.

I lunged forward, slamming my hands over my ears.

*BANG.*

PJ’s head slumped forward, a teasing smile still frozen on his lips.

*BANG.*

Lily gently tipped into PJ, like she was going to sleep.

Before she closed her eyes, Mom told me to *run*.

I can’t remember how long I stayed under the shattered remnants of Mom’s favorite table. The shadow was waiting for me to move, to make a noise.

I watched booted feet crunch through glass, getting closer and closer, and slowly, fight or flight began to take over.

Making it halfway across the living room, my palms slick with my mother’s blood, I thought I was going to live.

Cruel fingers wound their way through my hair and shoved me to my knees. 

I remember the phantom legs of a spider creeping down the back of my neck when the shadow with no face dragged the barrel of his gun down my spine.

“Turn around.”

The shadow had a voice.

When I didn’t move, the protruding metal stabbed into my neck.

“Turn *around*, kid!”

I did, very slowly.

Behind him, my siblings still weren’t moving.

They were asleep.

Lily was still smiling, strawberry-blonde ringlets stained red.

I couldn’t see PJ’s face anymore.

*BANG.*

I didn’t feel the gunshot.

I didn’t *feel* anything.

Looking down, I glimpsed slowly spreading red blossoming like a flower.

It felt like being cut from strings.

I hit the ground, just like my mother. My body felt heavy and wrong.

Paralyzed.

I remember being unable to scream, unable to cry, the salty taste of metal filling my mouth. It was like being winded. Rolling onto my side, all I could see was flickering candlelight.

The air was thick, so hard to breathe.

I rolled onto my back, trying to suck in air.

The shadow took a step back, opened the front door, and bled into the night.

I don’t remember the pain, and I don’t remember dying. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t conjure words in my mouth.

I felt warm and sticky, lying in my own blood.

I think I tried to move.

But I was so tired.

I’m not sure what death feels like because it’s like going to sleep.

I remember my last shuddering breaths, a lulling darkness beginning to swallow me up. I don’t know why I wasn’t afraid.

Oblivion almost felt like sinking into lukewarm depths on a summer’s day.

Oblivion wasn’t pain, and there was a peaceful inevitability to it.

It was endless nothing, a *nothing* I found myself gravitating towards. But before I could envelop myself in that darkness, it was spitting me back out.

The next thing I knew, I was in a white room, a slow beeping sound tearing me from slumber. I had a vague memory of roses spreading across my shirt, like summer flowers blooming.

Everything was white.

The walls, the ceiling, and my clothes.

Sensation hit me in slow waves.

Exhaustion.

I felt it tightening its grip around my brain, dragging me back onto a mountain of pillows when I tried to jump up. 

My Aunt May was sitting next to me on a plastic chair, her warm fingers entangled in mine. Aunt May and Mom were practically twins, with the same thick red hair and pale skin.

Mom wore her hair in a casual ponytail, while May preferred a strict bun.

I had to bite back the urge to yank my hand away.

Aunt May was asleep, used tissues filling her lap.

There was a nurse pottering around, checking my vitals and prodding my arms. My eyes felt heavy. I had to blink several times to keep myself awake.

“Charlie?”

The nurse’s voice was like wind-chimes.

I pretended not to notice her forced lipstick smile, the way she stood with her arms folded, staring at me like I was one of my cousin’s experiments. “You were in an accident, sweetie,” the nurse spoke up. I could see her trembling hands. “Just, um, try and rest, okay?”

I wanted to ask where my family was, but I already knew the answer. 

I think she knew that too. 

“You died, Charlie.” The nurse’s voice was eerily cold. “You were dead for thirteen minutes.” 

She took slow steps towards me, her eyes growing frenzied, like she couldn't understand me, like I was a puzzle she could not solve– and it was driving her crazy. I could see it in her twitching hands, her wobbling lips that were trying and failing to appear stoic. 

“In fact, I just pulled you out of the morgue, honey. I opened up your body bag that I had just zipped up, and told your aunt that you were a miracle I just… can’t understand.” The nurse sounded like she was trying to choke down a laugh, or maybe a sob. 

“Charlotte, you were pronounced dead at 3:02am from a gunshot wound to the chest.”  Taking a slow, sobering breath, the nurse tried to smile. 

“The bullet went through the right ventricle of your heart and severely damaged your left lung, rendering you unable to breathe. Your heart stopped, and after four attempts to resuscitate, we called it.”

Something slimy wound its way up my throat when she began to pace the room. 

“I… did all the paperwork. It took me two minutes. Your death certificate was signed, and your body was taken to the morgue to be prepped for transportation. Then I had my lunch. Tuna salad with a protein milkshake. I’m not a fan of the chocolate flavor.” 

She shook her head. “Anyway, when I came back to you, you were awake inside your body bag.” Her voice was starting to break. “You were…um, alive, and asked me for apple soda.”

The nurse moved closer, and yet kept her distance.

I could feel myself moving back, panic writhing through me. 

“So.” The nurse spoke calmly. “*How* the fuck are you still alive, Charlie?”

I think I passed out after that. 

When I woke up again, my head a lot less heavier, the nurse was gone.

Slowly, my foggy brain began to find itself and connect dots.

My mouth was dry, full of cotton. 

There was a sudden tightness, a sharp and cruel sting in my wrists. 

Something sharp was protruding into my flesh, and no matter how many times I violently wrenched my arm, it was stuck. It didn't feel right to be able to breathe so easily.

I knew the second I woke that my Mom was dead. 

Lily and PJ were dead, and it was like losing them all over again. 

As clarity came over me, I found my voice, a strangled cry escaping my lips. 

“Get it out.” I whispered in a shrill cry. 

Tugging at the IV in my wrist, I tried to yank the needle from my skin. 

“Get it out!” I shrieked, my gaze glued to the tiny spots of blood staining the insertion point.

I could see it again. 

So much blood. 

Mom was curled up on the floor, lying in slow spreading red that wouldn't stop, seeping across her beaded rug. 

She was all over me, slick on my skin and caked in my fingernails. 

*I couldn't wash her off of me.*

“You're okay, Charlotte.”

Aunt May’s voice came from my right, stabling me to reality. 

The world started to move again, started to make sense again, when she cupped my cheeks and told me to breathe. 

When I opened my mouth to ask where my family were, she lightly shook her head and I swallowed my words. 

Aunt May handed me a glass of water, and I drained it in one gulp.

*She told me I was a miracle.* 

Aunt May didn't say much, and when she did, she broke into sobs. 

Her eyes were raw from crying, clinging onto me, her shuddery voice reassuring me that I was going to be okay. 

She told me I would be living with her from now on, before wrapping me into a hug and leaving to get coffee. 

Once my aunt was gone, another nurse came to prod my IV. 

I tried to sleep, but the uncomfortable tightness of the needle sticking into my skin and the sterile white lights in my eyes made it impossible. I waited for grief to catch up with me, drowning me in a hollow oblivion I wouldn't be able to claw myself out of. But I didn't feel *sad*. I didn't feel angry. 

I wanted to know why my family were dead. 

I wanted to know *why* I was breathing, and their skin was ice cold. 

Rotting. 

The sudden image of maggots crawling up my brother’s nose sent me lurching into a sitting position, my stomach heaving. Reaching for my glass of water, it was empty. The sensation of throwing up felt familiar, almost comforting. 

Mom was always with me when I was sick, holding my hair back and lulling my hysteria with reassuring murmurs. 

I was frowning at the trash can by the door, my cotton candy brain trying to figure out if I would be able to make it in time, when a small voice drifted from the doorway, startling me. 

“I don't want you to come live with us.” 

My cousin was peeking through the door, hiding behind a shock of dark brown curls. Jude was the only brunette in our family. The rest of us were redheads. 

I wasn't sure why he was dressed up like a ghost, draped in a white cloak that was way too big for him. Jude was a weird kid. His mother, and my auntie, had inherited the family house, so in his mind, that made him superior. 

Jude made it clear he didn't like his cousins, refusing to let us play with him and banning us from family gatherings. 

When the adults were drinking cocktails and losing their awareness, Jude ordered us around. 

The times we *did* play with him, our cousin  showed us his spider collection, or the raccoon brain he kept in a jar. PJ was convinced our younger cousin was a serial killer. Several months earlier, he'd happily showed us the roadkill he'd been growing bacteria on under his bed. 

Jude’s ‘experiments’ were worrying. 

He stuffed mushrooms down my brother’s ears while he was sleeping, to, and I quote, “Recreate The Last Of Us.”

When Lily had a nosebleed during Thanksgiving dinner, Jude collected all her bloody tissues and refused to tell us where he'd put them, and *what* he had done with them. 

Fast-forward two months, and I found them under a nest of spiders. Jude was trying to adapt the spiders to be able to feed on human blood. I was surprised my cousin hadn't immediately demanded to see my siblings’ dead bodies for autopsy. 

Jude stepped into the room, shuffling his feet. 

“I'm sorry about Lily, PJ, and Aunt Ivy.” He mumbled, glaring at the floor tiles. 

My cousin made no move to offer real sympathy, instead speaking to the floor. 

“But I don't want you to come live with us.” Jude lifted his head, looking me dead in the eye. “I don't like you, Charlie. I want you to stay away.”

Before I could reply, he stepped back like I was diseased.

“You should be *dead*.” Jude grumbled. 

He scowled at me, getting my age purposely wrong as usual before running off. 

*“Happy 68th birthday.”*

I was six months older than him. 

In Jude’s eyes, I was ready for retirement. 

Still, though, my cousin was right. 

I was stone cold dead, and then I was somehow alive.

Which *was* wrong. 

Growing up, I realized Death was not so subtly attempting to fix his mistake. 

It started small. I'd choke on things I wasn't supposed to choke on. 

Chips. 

Candy. 

*Ice cream.*

Aunt May had to perform the heimlich manoeuvre when I choked on a piece of chicken. I thought I was just really unlucky, but then I locked myself in a freezer that didn't have a lock, and almost drowned in the local swimming pool, catching my foot in stray netting.

At the summer fair, Jude convinced me to try apple bobbing, only for my head to *conveniently* get stuck underwater. 

It started to make sense. 

I was supposed to die with my family that night, and death was out to get me.

Death started to get clever, changing his tactic. Instead of using everyday things to try to kill me, he sent reinforcements.

I turned twelve years old, and my aunt threw me a huge party, inviting all my classmates. Aunt May was *rich*, rich. 

Mom never explained it, but our grandparents left everything to May. 

The house was like a palace, a labyrinth of floors I was yet to explore, and two swimming pools. 

I was in the kitchen cutting myself a slice of cake, when, out of nowhere, a dead boy came rushing at me with one of my aunt’s favorite kitchen knives. 

A dead boy who I immediately recognised. 

Wren Oliver. 

Several years prior, he'd gone missing  from his parents' yard. The town launched a full investigation, only to find his body in a ditch a week later. 

*So, Death had sent a footsoldier*. 

Hiding under a hooded sweatshirt, Wren appeared older, like he had grown up with me. 

But there was a startling vacancy in his expression that drew the breath from my lungs, freezing me in place. Wren’s death was announced as an accident, though his wounds suggested the opposite, dried blood smearing his right temple and a cavernous hole in his chest, his clothes painted, stained, in bright red, glued in sticky mounds clinging to him. 

The boy’s eyes were wild, feral, like an animal. 

His hair was longer, a mess of reddish curls matted to his forehead. 

Lip split into a demented giggle. 

I remember taking a slow step back, my gaze glued to the knife. 

Wren’s fingers were wrapped around the handle like he knew exactly how to use it, how to plunge it into my heart and kill me for good. He moved like a predator, zero self awareness or recognition, only driven to kill me. 

The dead  boy prided himself in slow, intimidating steps, shoving me against the wall and dragging the blade of the knife down the curve of my throat. 

His eyes confused me, writhing with hatred that was artificial, programmed into him as Death’s official soldier.

He didn't speak, only smiled, revelling in my fear. I could tell it thrilled him, my trembling hands, my sharp, heavy breaths I couldn't control. Squeezing my eyes shut, I waited to finally die. 

I waited for the pain, and to lose my breath once again. 

But death was playing with me. 

When I opened my eyes, the dead boy was gone, and I was on my knees, screaming. 

“Wren Oliver is trying to kill me!"" I managed to hiss. 

My aunt knelt in front of me, her expression crumpling.

*Sweetie,” She spoke softly, squeezing my hands. Aunt May was trying to appear calm for my sake, but I could tell she was scared, her frantic eyes searching mine. “Wren Oliver is dead.”

The kids surrounding me started to giggle, whispering among themselves.

In the corner of my eye, my cousin was leaning against the door, mid eye roll. 

When my aunt was ushering kids back to the pool, Jude came to crouch in front of me. Ever since I started living with him, he'd made sure to keep his distance. 

This time, though, Jude leaned uncomfortably close, a sparkle in his eyes I had never seen before. Inclining his head, he rocked back and forth on his heels, prodding me in the forehead.

“If you see the dead boy again, can you tell me?” His lips curved into a smile. 

“I *did* see him.” I gritted out. “I’m not lying.”

Jude shrugged. “I never said you didn't,” he lowered his voice into a whisper, “I wanna know when you see him again.”

“Why?”

His lips curved into a smirk. 

“So, I can catch him.”

My cousin got closer, his breath tickling my cheek. 

“I seeeeeeee dead people.”

After that incident, death left me alone for a while.

I was fifteen, walking through the forest with a friend, catching fireflies in bell jars. 

Aunt May was lucky to live so close to the forest, the entrance just outside her back door. When we were little, PJ would drag Lily and me down the trail to escape Jude’s weird experiments.

I decided to invite Jem Littlewood on a summer walk.

Jem was cute, but in a dorky way. He was chronically clumsy and dressed like he'd been spat out of a John Hughes movie.

We hiked all the way to the end of the river and had a picnic, watching the sun set over the horizon. I was having conflicting feelings for this guy.

Jem was *obsessed* with fireflies.

Though he seemed more interested in photographing them than me.

The guy couldn't seem to sit still, jumping to his feet to marvel at tiny specks of light dancing in the air.

“I'm just going to take photos!” Jem beamed, holding up his camera.

I had to bite back the urge to say, “Don't you have *enough* photos?”

I nodded, and he turned and sprinted back down the trail.

Before his footsteps ground to a sudden halt.

At first, I thought he was snapping Polaroids.

When I got closer, though, blinking in the eerie dark, I caught something.

Bending down, I picked up a bell jar still spilling fireflies.

Further down the trail, Jem was lying crumpled in the dirt, his camera smashed to pieces next to him, blood running in thick rivulets down his temple. 

There he was. Leaning against a tree, his arms folded, was the ghost boy. 

Wren Oliver had grown up with me. Now a teenager, yet his face was carved into something else entirely—more of a monster, with slight points to his ears and too-sharp teeth, eyes ignited.

Wren didn't look like a ghost boy anymore.

Death had dressed him in shackles of ivy, a crown of glass and bone forced onto his head, entangled in his curls. Death was torturing him.

Wren’s body was its canvas, and every time I got away, he was punished, painting his failures across scarred skin.

I should have been running for my life, but I was mesmerized by each symbol cruelly carved into his neck.

The boy did a slow head incline, as if he couldn't believe I was standing in front of him.

His slow-spreading smile caught me off guard.

I remembered how to run, stumbling over my feet.

But I couldn't move.

The burning hatred that death had filled him with was stronger, hollowing him out completely. I managed two shaky steps before I felt him—an unearthly force winding its way around my spine. This time, he didn't hesitate.

I watched his mouth move, a single curve of his upper lip wrenching my body from my control, slamming me against a tree. There was something around my throat, choking the breath from my lungs, a thick fog spreading over my eyes.

Following his mouth curving into silent letters, I could feel my feet slowly leaving the ground, my legs dangling.

I was floating.

Hovering off the ground, suspended by his words.

Through half-lidded eyes, I caught the glint of a blade in his fist, but I couldn't move, couldn't scream.

He was drowning me, bleeding into my blood, spider-webbing and expanding in my brain without moving a muscle.

Instead, the ghost boy stood silently, running his thumb down the teeth of his knife while he ripped my lungs apart.

It was like suffocating, sinking into that peaceful oblivion I met at eight years old.

This time, though, the darkness was starving.

“Charlie?”

My eyes found daylight, a scream clawing out of my mouth.

“Charlie, it's past curfew!”

Wren flinched, his stoic expression crumpling.

The dead boy’s lips moved again, this time in a curse.

*Fuck.*

“Charlotte!”

Staggering back, Wren’s eyes widened, and the suffocating hold on me severed.

His head snapped in the direction my aunt was coming from.

“Charlie, answer me right now.”

He hesitated, his bare feet pivoting in the dirt as if he was considering finishing me off. Wren studied me with lazy eyes, sucking on his bottom lip. When my aunt's footsteps grew louder, branches snapping under her shoes, something contorted in the boy’s face.

Fear.

I guessed the boy wasn't expecting other humans to intrude.

Wren fell over himself, shuffling on his hands and knees, before diving to his feet. When he turned and ran, I was released, slipping to the ground, trying and failing to draw in breath. I barely felt the impact, only a dull thudding pain. 

I could hear the ghost boy’s footsteps, his uneven, shuddery breaths as he catapulted into a run. 

Under a late setting sun, I watched his dancing shadow disappear into the trees. 

*Mission unsuccessful, I guessed*. 

When I was fully conscious, Aunt May was checking over Jem, helping him sit up. 

“Where did he go?” I managed to get out, scanning the darkness for Wren. 

“He's okay, just concussed.” May whispered, dialling 911. 

My aunt applied a dressing to Jem’s wound, ignoring the boy’s hisses. 

“Keep still.” she murmured, smoothing his bandaid. “What happened, Charlotte?”

“She pushed me over.” Jem groaned, shuffling away from me. When my aunt told him to stay calm, he straightened up, leaning against the tree. “The psycho bitch tried to fucking kill me!”

When my aunt's gaze flicked to me, I shook my head. 

“It was Wren Oliver.” I gritted, teetering on hysteria. I could tell she didn't believe me, but I couldn't stop myself. 

I prodded at my throat, clawing for the indentations where his phantom fingers snaked around my neck, squeezing the breath from my lungs.

But there was nothing.

I could feel my mind starting to unravel. I nodded to my disgruntled classmate trying to dodge my aunt’s prodding. 

*“Ow, ow, ow! That stings!”*

“He knocked Jem out.” I managed. “Then he tried to kill me.”

Jem surprised me with a scoff. “You're seriously blaming your psychotic break on a dead kid?”

Aunt May pursed her lips, motioning for Jem to be quiet. Judging from her face, however, she agreed with the boy. 

May forced a smile, though it didn't quite reach her eyes. “Okay. Can you, uh, describe the boy to me, Charlotte?”

“He was wearing a crown,” I said, “And he looked my age.”

Aunt May cocked her head, and I saw real worry, like she was trying not to freak out. Jem made a snorting noise. 

“I'm sorry, he was wearing a *crown*?”

“Yes!” I insisted, getting progressively more frustrated. 

I tried to jump up, only for my aunt to gently lower me back down. “I know it sounds crazy, but death has sent Wren Oliver to kill me, just like my family. He tried to kill me when I was twelve, too!”

Jem let out a bitter laugh. “Your niece is a fucking wackadoodle.”

Aunt May’s eyes darkened. She grabbed my shoulders, her nails stabbing into my skin. “Charlie, I want you to *listen* to me, okay?” When my eyes found the rapidly darkening sky, my aunt forced me to look at her. 

“Charlotte!” 

She was as scared as me, her voice shuddering. 

“Wren Oliver is dead.” My aunt said firmly, shaking me. Even then, though, I wasn't even looking at her. I was trying to find his ignited eyes lighting up the dark. 

“Wren died at eight years old in a terrible accident, and you can't keep using him as an excuse for your mental trauma.” 

There was something twitching in her expression I was trying to make sense of. When I risked a look at Jem, the boy was staring at me dazedly– like I really was crazy. 

Aunt May pressed her face into my shoulder, and I could feel her tears soaking into my shirt. She was trying to hold it together, trying to understand. 

“Charlie, I know you lost your family,” she whispered. “But you and Wren Oliver are not the same. You survived, and he didn't.” Her voice splintered.

“You need to come to terms with that, okay?”

When I didn't respond, she pinched my chin, forcing me to look at her. 

“Charlotte.”  

Aunt May’s voice turned cold. “I ignored this when you were a kid, but if you continue to use this poor boy as a coping mechanism, I will have no choice but to send you to a specialist.”

When Jem was taken away by paramedics, Aunt May held my hand, squeezing my fingers for dear life.

I caught her gaze scanning the tree's around us, delving into twisting oblivion. Every little noise sent her twisting around. She was looking for something. 

“I'm going to get you help.” Aunt May said in a low murmur when we were back at the house. Jude was sitting on the kitchen counter, legs swinging. I could feel his penetrating gaze burning into the back of my head. 

Aunt May set a cup of cocoa on the table.

“No more fairytales.” 

By the time I was eighteen, I had bitten three therapists. 

They refused to believe that death was coming to reclaim my soul, and was using a dead boy to do his dirty work. 

For my 16th birthday, I braced myself to come face to face with Wren Oliver’s ghost.

I wasn't even in town, staying at a friend's house. 

But dead boys, and especially dead boys moulded into Death’s personal soldiers, could materialise anywhere.

I locked every door in the house, and taped up my friend’s window.

Nothing happened. 

On my seventeenth birthday, I was sick in bed with gastritis. 

Still no ghost boy. 

Death seemed to have finally left me alone. 

On my eighteenth birthday, I was stuffing books in my locker when my cousin popped up out of nowhere, scowling as usual. 

After an unexpected growth spurt and losing a tonne of baby fat, my cousin had scaled the high school hierarchy, swapping his weird experiments for a varsity jacket and *experimenting* with his sexuality. 

The two of us had come to an unspoken truce. 

I kept quiet about his spider collection to his popular friends, and he *tolerated* my existence until I left for college.

“Your surprise party is cancelled.”

Jude  leaned against my locker, running a hand through thick dark hair tucked under a baseball cap. Jude never admitted it, but he was definitely embarrassed of being the odd one out. 

My siblings may be dead, but they were *still* redheads.

I pulled off his cap with a smile, throwing it in his face. “Sure it is.”

My cousin’s eyes widened. He lost his slick bravado, grabbing for his cap. 

“Hey!”

According to my cousin, my party was unexpectedly cancelled *every* year. 

I wasn't sure if it was his weird superiority complex, or just plain jealousy, but it was getting exhausting.

Jude followed me down the hallway, matching my stride. 

“Can you just *not* come home tonight?”

I quickened my pace. “It's only a party. I'm having some friends over, and no, we won't go anywhere near your room.”

“No, I *mean*.” Jude stepped in front of me, and for the first time in a while, he wasn't trying to hide disdain for me. 

His dark eyes pinned me in place for a moment, the world around us coming to a halt. 

Sound bled away, and all I heard were his slow breaths. There was something there, an unexplainable twitch in his eyes and lips, that twisted my gut. 

Jude stepped closer, his lip curling. He shoved me back, losing his facade. 

“Stay the fuck away from the house tonight.” He said, and his voice, his tone, was enough to send shivers creeping down my spine. Jude had always hid behind a ten foot wall in his mind. 

It was jarring to see something in him finally start to splinter. *Fuck.* I thought. 

*This kid had serious Mommy issues.* 

I blinked, and the world resumed, kids pushing past us. 

Jude seemed to catch himself, slipping back under his mask. 

“I'm having friends over,” he rolled his eyes, “Your presence will ruin the vibe.”

“It's *my* birthday?”

He groaned, tipping his head back. “Yes, I know. But–”

“I *think* you can deal with the attention off of you for one night, Jude.”

“Will Wren Oliver be there too?” Jem Littlewood hollered.

Jude didn't respond for a moment, his lip curling. 

“Shut the fuck up.” He spat at Jem, who immediately backed down. 

With an audience this time, Jude forced an award winning smile. “Fine.” His lips split into a grin I knew he hated. 

My cousin clamped his hand on my shoulder, hard enough to hurt. I could feel his fingers pinching the material of my jacket. “Have it your way, dude.”

Jude backed away with a two fingered salute.

“Happy 78th birthday!” 

In a sense, I wish I listened to my cousin.

My party was a success, sort of.

Four of us, a crate of beers, and no sign of my cousin.

I was mildly tipsy, sitting on the edge of the pool, dangling my legs in the water when my friend demanded more beers.

I was also hungry for cake, so I stumbled inside in search of it.

The house was dark, lit in dazzling blue by the pool's lights reflecting through the windows. Aunt May was in her office on the ground floor, and Jude was getting high in his room. In my drunken state, I found myself marveling at my aunt's house and how much of it was left unexplored.

For example, in the foyer, past the spiral staircase she’d had custom-made, was an elevator I had never questioned.

There was a girl my age standing on the staircase.

She was frozen mid-run, dressed in ragged jeans and a t-shirt.

Everything about her stood out, bringing me to a sobering halt.

The girl reminded me of my sister—or at least, if my sister had ever grown up.

I wasn't sure if I was drunk or hallucinating.

Her flower crown was pretty...

*Lily had grown wings.*

I was slowly moving towards her when a sudden bang sounded from the kitchen.

The *bang* of something shattering on the floor.

Twisting around, I found myself gravitating towards warm golden light.

The first thing I saw was the refrigerator door hanging open, and someone—no, *something*—rooting around inside it.

Glued to the spot, I dazedly watched it grab milk, guzzle it down, then soda, cracking open each can and sucking them dry, before carving its fingers into my birthday cake.

But I wasn't looking at the spillage of food seeping across the floor. Instead, my gaze found a crown of antlers—both human and animal bone entangled with dead flowers and human remains—glued to a head of familiar matted brown curls. 

There was something sticking out of battered and bruised flesh, twin gaping slits sliced through a torn shirt resembling glass wings that were not yet formed, reminding me of a butterfly.

*Wings.*

But not the wings I dreamed of as a kid. These things were unnatural mounds that both did and didn't make sense on a human boy. I could see the trauma of them slicing through his flesh—monstrous, looming things protruding from what was left of a human spine.

Human, and yet I couldn't call his beautifully grotesque face *human*.

Wren Oliver had grown up with me, now an adult.

Eighteen years old.

His clothes confused me—a single white shirt and shorts.

Wren’s feet were bare, battered and bruised, blood smearing my aunt's tiles.

*Angel.*

Death had turned his foot soldier—and my future killer—into an angel.

But there was nothing angelic about the dead boy, his body and mind sculpted and molded into Death’s own.

The boy no longer resembled a human—feral eyes and a manic smile, choking down pieces of cake. His face had been contorted into a monster—gnashing teeth and sharp points in his ears, a sickly tinge to malnourished skin.

And that's when it hit me, watching him stuff himself with food.

Something slimy inched its way up my throat.

The boy didn't move. I don't even think he'd noticed me, gorging himself on anything he could get his hands on.

Chicken, raw bacon, leftover salad.

When he moved on to cupcakes, licking frosting from his fingers, I glimpsed markings on his arms—a language I didn't understand, carved into him.

His wrists were shackled, bound in entangled iron and vine—iron ingrained into his skin, vines, flowers, and ivy entangling his bones, polluting his blood. Slowly, my eyes found stab wounds splitting open his torso.

Raw flesh, where his skin had been torched, melting, and then merging—ripped apart and put back together over and over again.

I found his heart, the gaping cavern in his chest where it should be.

And it was.

Marked, carved, and branded with a symbol resembling an X.

Wren Oliver was not *dead*.

But, just like me, he should have been.

I remember saying his name, my voice slurred slightly.

I didn't drink *that* much, but I could barely coerce words, my head spinning.

Wren’s neck snapped towards me, his eyes narrowing with resentment I couldn't understand—hatred that seemed to puppeteer him. Slowly tilting his head, the boy’s lips split into a grin, eyes filled with, polluted by, mania.

I could see where his lips had been stitched shut and then ripped open.

“Hi.”

He held up his hand in an awkward wave.

When one of my friends stumbled into the kitchen, Wren reacted on impulse.

He picked up a knife from the counter, throwing it like a dart, straight through the guy’s throat.

Something shattered inside my mind.

Ignoring my friend bleeding out, Wren stumbled over himself, abandoning his feast. He took a single step towards me, backing me against the wall, coming so close—close enough for me to feel his very real breath grazing my cheeks. 

Just like when he was a kid, he traced the teeth of his blade down my throat. I wasn't expecting him to burst out laughing, trembling with hysteria.

His eyes were wild, feral, and wrong—almost euphoric.

With what I could only recognize as *relief.*

**BANG**.

I was barely aware of the gunshot.

The bullet went straight through his head, the winged boy hitting the ground.

Dead.

I saw the blood stemming around him in a halo before the bleeding pool faltered, seeping back inside his head.

Like rewinding a VCR.

Wren was dead, and then he was alive.

Wren’s body contorted, his chest inflating.

His gasp for air was painful, strangled, eyes opening wide.

*Terrified.*

“You fucking idiot.”

Jude’s voice sent me twisting around.

My cousin stood in the exact same robes he wore as a child.

The world tipped off kilter, and I was on my knees, then my stomach.

I sunk to the floor, my thoughts swimming. 

Jude’s murmur followed me, creeping into the dark.

“I told you not to come home.”

I can't remember how long I was unconscious for. 

When I woke, I was dressed in an evening gown, a dress that used to be my mother’s.  

My vision cleared, and I found myself sitting in an unfamiliar room resembling an abandoned swimming hall. 

The pool itself was empty, the bottom stained revealing scarlet. 

There were symbols carved into each tile.

Like a game. 

“Sit up straight, Charlotte.”

I was sitting at a banquet. 

Jude was in front of me, sipping on wine. 

He caught my eye for half a second before averting his gaze. 

At the far end of the table sat my aunt May. 

Kissing the rim of her glass, her smile was twisted. 

“I've been waiting so long to give you your birthday presents, Charlotte. Your memories should be returning soon.”

“Mom.” Jude muttered, hiding behind his glass. “Calm down. You're embarrassing yourself.”

Ignoring my cousin, May tapped her glass with a fork, and in walked my *birthday presents.*

No, dragged. 

By their hair. 

Wren Oliver, the dead boy, was in fact my aunt's prisoner. 

Behind him, was the girl who looked so much like Lily. 

I think that's why my aunt chose her. 

Aunt May cleared her throat. 

“For a long time, our family has lived among creatures who live in the forest you played inside. In exchange for keeping this town safe, they only ask for small favors. Wayward children who disappear into the woods are good enough payment. Charlie, you and your siblings do not share our inheritance. 
Your mother never wanted fae children. She wanted you to be human.” 

Aunt May’s smile faded. 

“After losing my sister, and my niece and nephew, I made a deal to give my last surviving niece 100 years of life.”

Her words were white noise, my gaze glued to my birthday presents. I couldn't call them human anymore. 

I couldn't call Wren human, when his face was so beautifully grotesque, painfully hypnotising. 

The monstrous things sticking from twin slits in his back were supposed to be wings, except they looked wrong, cruelly protruding from his exposed spine. Under the influence of alcohol earlier, the girl made me smile. 

Her wings, to me, looked like one of a real fairy. 

In reality, they were torn and shredded apart, bigger than the girl herself. 

When she dropped onto her stomach, she was dragged back to her feet, her knees buckling under the weight. Her tiara of flowers and bone looked pretty to me when I saw her on the stairs. 

Now, though, I could see the pearly white of a human child's skull forced onto her head, dead flowers threaded through cavernous, gaping eye sockets. 

The two of them were violently shoved into the empty pool. 

“Jude. Please demonstrate, sweetheart.”

Jude stood, pulling out a gun, and aiming it at the winged girl.

*BANG*. 

The girl’s body hit the tiles, her blood seeping across stained white. 

“Now, of course, our king did not give you life for free.” May continued. 

“The King demanded a debt, as well as two heirs to join him in his court once your hundred years were complete.” 

Her lips quirked into a smile. 

“The king is smart. If a child cannot be stolen from the human world, they can, however, be made, moulded and shaped from their human forms, skinned of their humanity through their suffering, leaving a hollowed out shell in the child's place.” 

She was speaking so casually, ignoring Wren’s whimpers.

“The transformation takes a while. 100 years to birth a fully blooded fae heir, who will lose their human memories, in preparation to join their new family.”

Jude shot Wren in the chest, his eyes empty.

This time, he dropped his weapon, using finger-guns instead. 

“Bang.” He deadpanned. 

Then the neck.

I watched Wren come back to life, and then die. 

Over and over again. 

I think at one point, he screamed and cried. 

But not now. 

He was their puppet on display, dancing for their entertainment. 

Half lidded eyes drowned in oblivion found mine, and I understood his hatred.

Before he was shot again.

Stabbed. 

Branded and burned, and ripped apart.

At some point, I screamed at them to stop. I couldn't breathe, slamming my hands over my ears and begging them.

Aunt May didn't listen, ordering for my hands to be tied down. 

“The King required two human sacrifices to suffer in your place.” She concluded. “For one hundred years.”

Aunt May’s smile was suddenly sad, and she lifted her glass in a toast. 

I was watching their blood trickle down each tile in the pool, like every death, every time they suffered, my body became progressively less human. 

I felt disgusting. I wasn't supposed to be alive. Every single year of my life, every breath I had taken, was stolen. 

Aunt May nodded at me, her lips forming a proud smile. She stood up, and was handed a sacrificial knife. 

Climbing into the swimming pool herself, she strode over to Wren. 

The boy slumped to the floor, trembling, his knees against his chest. 

Aunt May grabbed him by the hair, forcing his head up, and sliced the blade across his throat. 

His eyes flicked to me, and I swore he smiled. 

Spots of red dotted yellowing tiles, a river trickling under my aunt's heels.

After I got her number we made plans to get coffee, but she ended up canceling on me because she had to focus on studying for finals(valid), and told me that we should hang out after break. 

A few days after I got home, I texted her asking how her finals went and we had a brief conversation about that and how break was going in general, and then she hasn't replied to my last text for days. I'm not sure if it's because she's starting to lose interest or if it's because I just said something that doesn't prompt a response or whatever.

I can't read her at all because she takes a long time to reply to my texts and she's been like this from the get go (always takes hours, if not a day or two to respond), but whenever she does reply she seems interested and keeps the conversation going. 

I won't be seeing her until February because my school as a J term type thing, and I'm not sure how to go about this to maintain contact over break, or if I should even text her at all since she never ended up replying to my last messages.

1hqrgy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hqrgy5/profitec_move_preinfusion_method/,Profitec MOVE Preinfusion Method,"Hello Everyone,

Been watching some videos on the new Profitec MOVE and it has a different sort of preinfusion method that I have not seen used before.

It turns the pump ON for a programmed time waits a set time and then turns the pump back ON to complete the extraction.  I've been used to the pump turning ON at a reduced power for a set time and then increasing to full power.  How do these two methods compare?

The waiting time, or passive phase as Profitec call it, does not count towards the extraction time which is different from what I have previously been told.  I always thought the extraction time was the total time the water was in contact with the coffee and started from when you pressed the start extraction button.

Your thoughts and comments would be appreciated.

Feels like I've had less thoughts in general, and thats possibly coffee sort of helping me be less forgetful due to having adhd (diagnosed and all). Its like everything is melting away out of my memory. 

Some odd theories however: what if coffee/too much caffine somehow reshapes your soul/mind in a way that makes you more prone to paranormal/spiritual feelings/feeling entities? Feels like I, partially, lost access to some section of life/other plane in a way and cant really feel things where I could before. (arguably it was in a way that sounds like i need to see a mental health specialist). 

Some other odd theory: What if coffee let you into some realm/area in which something? was trying to experiment with people or testing people, and quitting coffee just dropped you out of that sample group (with alot of people being the control group). No coffee, no real ""hey something spiritual trying to communicate with you"", but not completely gone and theres a chance that you could get pulled back in). A family member I know drinks alot of coffee and says they experience things that generally most people say aren't possible.  

Likely: Coffee was just bad for my mental health, or a lot of peoples mental health. Admittedly I've been a bit less anxious and everything now however the benefit of focusing better that came with moderate amounts of coffee is something I need to work around. (likely with fitness and working out). I'm aware how alot of the prior might sound.

I know no one has the answer, this is probably more of a venting than it is a question.

I’m a decently attractive guy with my own company, a master’s degree, an overly generous spirit, and I’m emotionally available, yet…

Meeting people is a challenge. Simply, just getting someone to actually go on a date or meet for a simple coffee. 

Dates are either boring, filled with wacky conversation, or all about whether or not there will be some action after the date.

Friendships or connections I make with other gay men always have this undertone of feelings or desires that push past typical friendships, but with no action taken against them. If you make a really close friend and he ends up dating someone, you have to worry about losing their friendship because their partner might be jealous.

Many men say they want a long term relationship, real connections, but when it comes down to committing to something - even if it’s just to test if a relationship would work - they shy away from it and tell you deserve better and that you’ll find someone someday.

1hqrb12,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1hqrb12/my_neighbor_perched_himself_on_top_of_a_pine_tree/,"My neighbor perched himself on top of a pine tree in my backyard and never came down. The sheriff of our small town did the same, only a day later.","When Henry perched himself atop that pine tree, I thought he’d just lost his damn mind. No amount of convincing from Jim or the sheriff could coax him down. He ascended into the canopy and never returned.

Never returned alive, at least.

He’d always been an eccentric. It wasn’t easy living next-door to Henry, but it certainly wasn’t dull, either. Between the small city of birdhouses he maintained around the perimeter of his two-story house, the free homebrewed mead that appeared on our doorstep the first of every month, and the early morning French Horn recitals, he was a handful.

I rather liked the ongoing spectacle, all things considered. Jim never really saw the humor in Henry’s mania. That said, crippling agoraphobia has prevented me from leaving the house for almost a year now, so my threshold for what qualifies as entertainment is quite a low bar to clear.

My husband was on his way to confront Henry about his newest hobby, metal detecting, when he first scaled that twenty-foot tall pine in our backyard. It wasn’t the act of metal detecting that bothered Jim - it was the many untended holes that vexed him. The sixty-something year old found himself too lost in paroxysms of archeological fervor to bother filling the quarries back up with soil after he made them. After days of steady excavation, it looked like Henry had been sweeping his property for landmines.

That morning, Jim saw the man creeping towards the edge of the forest thirty yards from our kitchen window, and he sprung into action. If I’m recalling correctly, he shouted something like, “*I’m going to nip this in the bud*” as he jogged out the front door, which now carries a cruel cosmic irony when examined in retrospect.

The scene unfolded before me through the dusty lens of our den’s cheap telescope, which has a lovely panoramic view of the backyard and the thicket beyond from where we keep it.

As much as it pains me to admit it, fear of the space outside my house has turned me into a bit of a snoop.

Jim sauntered up to our neighbor, but Henry didn’t turn around to greet him. Nor did he stop lurching forward. He didn't even react to Jim, as far as I could tell. It was like he was moving in slow-motion autopilot. Although irritated, it wasn’t like my husband’s molten rage drove Henry to the top of that pine out of a concern for his safety.

No matter what Jim did or said, Henry remained locked in an impenetrable trance. A man on a mission.

He gave up on catching Henry’s attention by the time he had made it three quarters of the way up. As Jim started to walk back, I kept watching. Henry, the sleepwalker, never changed his pace. Each identical movement was eerily slow and deliberate. After reaching the apex, he positioned himself to face our home, extended both arms palms up in front of his chest, and became impossibly still. An unblinking gargoyle baking in the early morning summer sun.

At least, I thought he stationary.

When I checked on him an hour later through the telescope, however, he had spun his torso about thirty degrees west. Arms still extended, eyes still open, but his body had turned. Concerned and captivated in equal measure, I began observing him continuously.

While I watched, nothing seemed to change, and I was becoming progressively unnerved by his uncanny stillness. But when I paused my vigil after about twenty minutes, something occurred to me - he *was* moving. I could tell when I brought my eye away from the telescope. Looking through the den window, his torso had clearly pivoted another fifteen degrees clockwise. The motion was just so slow that I found it hard to perceive in real time.

I put my eye back to the lens of the telescope.

Henry’s skin was developing a red sheen. His unblinking eyes were dry and tinged with brown specks, like overcooked egg whites.

That’s when I called the sheriff.

The grizzled southerner and his doe-eyed deputy arrived quickly, seeing as they were only a three-minute drive down the road. They stood at the base of that pine for an hour, but couldn’t find the language to persuade Henry down either. Flustered and out of patience, the sheriff told us he would involve the fire department tomorrow if Henry remained in the tree.

When night fell, I couldn’t visualize Henry through the telescope anymore. But I could *hear* him. From our bedroom window, faintly sobbing somewhere in the blackness.

I found myself posted up in the den before the sun even rose, my mind burning with curiosity. Black coffee trickled down my throat, warming my marrow. For a moment, I felt ashamed of the excitement rumbling around in my chest.

The more I reflected on the sensation, however, the more I understood it. Journalism used to be my life before the cumulative horrors I documented manifested as a crippling fear of the world. In the grand scheme of things, this stakeout was pathetic. It didn't hold a candle to what I had done before, in a past life. But fascination, not dread, drove me to do it, and that held value.

Henry had not moved from his steeple, and by the time the sun appeared over the horizon, he had stifled his tears. His biceps were red and swollen, likely muscle breakdown from keeping them outstretched in the same position for over twenty-four hours.

A little after eight, Jim made his way downstairs. He was unusually quiet. Initially, I attributed his silence to low-level distress, secondary to Henry’s unexplained behavior. When I finally noticed him, he was standing by the front door, away from the view of our neighbor’s macabre display.

I asked him if he was doing alright, and he replied with an affirmative grunt, so I left him be.

Around noon, I felt a theory crystallize in my skull. Henry was twisting around the tree’s axis with a pace and direction identical to yesterday's. He must be watching something, I thought. That’s when it hit me.

Henry was angling his eyes and his body to constantly face the sun.

My mind scrambled to process this observation, but Jim’s heavy breathing behind me broke my concentration. It scared the shit out of me because I didn’t hear him approach. Startled, I urged him to explain what the hell he was doing.

*“Oh…fixing clock,”* he replied.

Except there was no clock. In actuality, he had his face pressed to the window that was to the right of me. He was staring at something.

I didn’t want to believe it at first. But by the afternoon, I was forced to confront the realization. From where I sat in the den, I could see Henry’s back through the telescope, and when I moved my eye away, I could see Jim’s back, silently gazing forward.

Early that morning, he had been watching the sun rise from our front door, just the same as Henry had from atop the pine tree.

My husband was following the trajectory as well.

Before I could dial 9-1-1, the sheriff and his deputy appeared in my peripheral vision. My burst of relief was short-lived when I observed how they were walking. Their footfalls were languid and protracted, the same as Henry’s had been yesterday.

As their hands contacted two different pine trees in unison, I refocused the telescope on Henry. To my horror, they were not climbing the tree where my neighbor sat to rescue him.

The possessed men were scaling their own trees, each equidistant from Henry’s.

In a state of detached shock, I moved a shaky hand to my notebook to jot down one last detail I had noticed about Henry.

Tiny mushrooms had sprouted from his eye sockets, palms and his open mouth. A robin rested on his forehead, nibbling at the growing fungus.

A wave of primal terror washed over me, and I sprinted from my chair to my front door, pausing as my hand twisted the knob.

I tried to force myself through the threshold. My head pivoted back to Jim for motivation, who hadn’t moved an inch, in spite of the noise of the chair and the telescope crashing to the floor when I sprang up.

Unable to overcome my agoraphobia, I instead sat down on the doormat and placed my head in my hands.

Whatever Henry succumbed to, it had spread to the sheriff, the deputy, and my husband. I contemplated calling 9-1-1, but what if it just spread to emergency medical services as well?

I’m not sure how long I lingered there, catatonic. The blood-chilling wails of my husband returned my consciousness to my body.

It had become night.

The absence of natural light had made Jim into a messy human puddle on the kitchen floor.

I tiptoed over to my husband, doing my best to ignore the pangs of terror vibrating in my spine. He had simply crumbled where he stood when the sun set, knelling unnaturally with his chest and torso leaning against the wall below our kitchen window.

Despite knowing he wasn’t, I asked if he was okay a handful of times, receiving no reply.

Standing over him, I tilted his shoulder, trying to see his face. Jim limply fell over in response. He was still crying softly, eyes open but producing no tears.

That’s when I noticed his chest wasn’t moving.

He wasn’t breathing.

When I found the courage to check, he had no pulse, and I lost consciousness.

I woke up a few hours later.

Through the telescope, I could see my husband perched on a pine tree of his own, arms outstretched and eyes still open. Hellish choreography modeled by Henry, mimicked by the sheriff, the deputy, and Jim.

My current theory is as follows: Henry must have accidentally unearthed something old and terrible digging holes in his backyard. A parasitic fungus lying dormant under the soil, infecting everyone who went near with inhaled spores once it was exposed.

I’m going to make it outside today. I'll grab a shovel from the garage, and I'll fill every single hole Henry made with layers of soil. Maybe I’ll survive uninfected, but I suspect I will succumb to whatever this thing is as well.

But it’s the least I can do to honor Jim’s memory.

I’m taking the time to document and post this for two reasons.

First and foremost, don’t end up like me. I hid from the world because it felt safer. But it wasn’t safer, it was just easier, and I wasted precious time.

Secondly, if you see anyone perched on a tree, eyes following the trajectory of the sun, burn the tree down or run. Whatever you do, cover your mouth.

Because that robin ate some of the fungus that grew from Henry and may disseminate the spores as far as it can fly.

The start of its life cycle? It’s unclear, and I think that, unfortunately, the world may have an answer to that question in a few days.

My Boyfriend (M39) and I (F38) will have been together for nearly 5 years. Not married. I have one daughter from a previous marriage. 

Throughout our relationship I have proactively addressed many things that make me feel triggered or insecure around social media usage. Things like double tapping bikini pics, adding an inordinate amount of beautiful ""female friends"", being secretive with his technology and all the typical stuff I'm sure a lot of relationships go through now that we live in the social media age. I've expressed that these behaviors do not make me feel emotionally safe in my relationship and have asked to see his DM's with these ""female friends"", he will quickly tap tap some things and then show me, or hold the phone in his hand and basically not allow me to see for myself. So obviously there is something there. I don't think its anything more than him reacting with heart eye or fire emojis to their stories but who knows, and is that enough for me to be annoyed? It feels pretty shady.

I bought a home last year and he's moved in and helps me pay bills, but I am certainly the breadwinner and primary provider. He's a ""good guy"" in the sense that he's never yelled at me, or talked down to me. He's a gentle person and showers me in affection. Brings me coffee in the morning and will do chores when I finally begin to show signs of annoyance that I'm carrying the invisible labor. But do should I have to get annoyed or start a fight to see some participation? I hate being perceived as a nag, but this stuff is starting to build up some resentment. He works at a hospital overnight so he basically sleeps during the day and I have become the primary household labor, which I was really trying to avoid in this relationship. He will acknowledge that I don't feel supported or that i don't feel emotionally safe and change his ways for about a week, maybe less and then back to the normal shenanigans. 

He added a new beautiful 20 something Latina (I only mention her age and ethnicity because it's his preferred type based on patterns) to his Instagram a few weeks ago, I just rolled my eyes at the audacity and moved on but something has been nagging at me about it. I decided to find her on Facebook today and as it turns out, they work together. I'm not going to prevent or control who he chooses to engage with on Social Media but it's triggering fearful feelings on my end due to past indiscretions on his. I've told him how it makes me feel when he adds new female ""friends"" many many times. These are not your typical co workers and so on, they're all a stereotypical beautiful local single women. I get they work together but why does this need to trickle into his personal life or social media if he's in a committed relationship?

I'm relatively new to drinking quality tea (having been brewing gongfu style). I usually drink oolong since that's my preference, and have tried enough to have a basic understanding of the different offerings out there.

However, one thing that I have trouble with is when I look at more expensive / premium options. For example, Tea Dealers sells 50g of an aged 2008 Da Hong Pao for $300.  
[https://www.teadealers.com/collections/oolong/products/china-zheng-yan-da-hong-pao-2008](https://www.teadealers.com/collections/oolong/products/china-zheng-yan-da-hong-pao-2008)

Obviously this is not an everyday tea, and (potentially?) overpriced in some capacity. A site I order from (Old Ways Tea) has two aged Da Hong Paos (1992, 50g at $150) + (2000, 50g at $42).

[https://oldwaystea.com/products/aged-da-hong-pao-1992?taxon\_id=39](https://oldwaystea.com/products/aged-da-hong-pao-1992?taxon_id=39)

There's plenty other examples of how the same tea varietal is priced differently and so I'm trying to understand what explains the big disparities that are sometimes seen. I'm a big specialty coffee guy - would an analogous situation be like how a varietal (e.g. Gesha coffee) can be grown in slightly different terroirs / roasted by different individuals, which then significantly affects final pricing?

The main differentiator I can see for Tea Dealer's Wuyi oolongs is that they happen to be done under a Teamaster named Ye Qitong. Not sure how this would translate in the taste / brewing of the tea IRL, or whether this is largely branding. Any insight is appreciated, just looking to learn more!",3,1735689260.0,tea,1,1.0,False

Now, onto me:
Personality: Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist. That’s me. I’m the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life’s absurdities. But don’t worry, I’m not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you’re into sarcasm and don’t take life too seriously, we’ll get along just fine.

Hobbies: If you like comedy and horror flicks, we’ll have plenty to binge-watch together. I’m also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal, I’m open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it’s exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

Bonus points if you enjoy laid-back mornings. I’m all about lazy Sundays, relaxing, and making memories over shared experiences.

What I’m looking for:
Connection: I’m drawn to women who speak their mind and aren’t afraid to get real. Whether we’re vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I’m here for it. If you’ve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I’ll be hooked.

Consistency: I want someone who’s invested in making our connection strong every single day, no ghosting, no playing games. Consistent effort and genuine affection are non-negotiable for me. If you’re the type who stays engaged and interested, we’ll have something real and lasting.

Energy: I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let’s start with a voice or video chat. It’s more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we’re willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

Open-Mindedness: I’m open to long-distance relationships and even the idea of living in another state or country someday, as long as we can visit each other and build our connection. I’m not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it’s way more fun if we’re a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we’ll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

Let’s be real, physical attraction matters. I believe in being upfront and getting that out of the way early. Let’s exchange pictures as soon as possible so we can both know if we feel that spark. It’s important to me to build something genuine, and that starts with knowing there’s mutual attraction.

I also love cuddling, watching movies, and being affectionate. I want a partner who’s not afraid to express themselves emotionally and intimately. Deep conversations, daily texting, and phone calls are my kind of connection. If you’re the kind of person who loves to share their feelings and stay close, we’ll be a great match.

The Essentials:
I’ve got a job and my life together, and I’m hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I’ve done the long-distance thing before, so if you’re from another state or even another country, no worries, we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

I’m looking for someone to join me in discovering the best hidden spots in town, whether it’s a new coffee shop, a haunted house, or the perfect hiking trail. Let’s make some memories together.

So, what do you say? Want to see if we’re a match, or are you going to make me work harder to prove I’m worth it? Maybe we’ll get lost in the woods of Maine or somewhere equally unexpected, together.",1,1735689235.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1hqr23o,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1hqr23o/need_advice_for_sleeping_after_day_of_fasting/,Need advice for sleeping after day of fasting,"For the past year, my routine has been to eat 800 calories on M/W/F and eat normally the rest of the days. My intent at the start was to do near-total fasts on those fasting days, but I found the hunger way too debilitating. Last week, I had a breakthrough and pretty easily accomplished near-total fasts for my last three fasting days. The key is coffee: I have an espresso with a splash of milk at 6am, an Americano with 2.5oz of milk at 11am, and a decaf Americano with 2.5oz of milk at 4pm. Something about the caffeine, the bitterness, and the large quantity of warm liquid makes the hunger very manageable.

However, I'm finding I now have a lot of trouble falling and staying asleep on my fasting days. My head feels sleepy, but my body feels ""jumpy"". I've tried magnesium glycinate in the past to improve my sleep to no avail. I'll try it again, but I'm doubtful it will help.

Today I had my first ""date"" in 25+ years. I kept it low-key: coffee in a nice but plain coffee shop. I met her on an app. She was pretty, very much my 'type,' and looked nice. It was a good, low-pressure meet-up. We talked for almost two hours.

I know a lot of guys in here will say this is too soon and ""work on yourself,"" but for me this is working on myself: I need to re-learn how to be social with women who are available and get my social anxieties in check. The rest of me is good. I have no expectations other than becoming a better dater. She'd like to see me again, so I did OK for a first outing.

I have another date set for Friday with another woman, a girlfriend from my high school days. We've been lightly flirting by text for a couple of months -- we coincidentally came back in touch with each other just days after my ex asked for a divorce. Due to holiday schedules, this week is the first time we both have a free evening.

I never dated casually in the before times. It's extremely weird to now have 2 dates within a few days of each other. I give each of these a low percentage chance of getting serious -- I suspect that political differences will emerge and become a deal-breaker for one or both of them -- but it would be just my rotten luck to have both of them turn into ""serious"" contenders and find myself in a whole new unpleasant situation.",2,1735688683.0,Divorce_Men,2,0.75,False

I loved having an actual reason to browse and search for the perfect scent. And THANK YOU again for such a wonderfully curated box. It was really hit after hit. A way better ratio than I ever have for myself. I'm already obsessed with quite a few scents (Area of Effect-Stardew & Solstice Scents-Lace Draped Spectre being two that I wore just while typing this up). You really have a gift for this!
I put together some mostly first impression reviews on all of the scented goodies if anyone is interested. I tried not to ramble too much but some scents just inspire a good ramble. 
There were also some very great  non-scented items! If you have the chance to try the tea Poesie sells I have to highly recommend Geneva. (And if you can't get around to trying Geneva yourself or don't do green teas I would recommend adding a sprig of rosemary to your favorite plain tea. You can thank me later). The other edible goodies did not last very long. I devoured the little banana cakes in no time at all and the other goodies shortly after. The yarn is exactly what I need to finish a tank top I've been knitting! I'll have to share a photo whenever that gets finished!
Once again, thank you so much! It was a blast!

Arcana Wildcraft-Cascadian Mermaid: Cannabis concentrate accord, uplifting grapefruit, cotton candy, Moroccan blue chamomile, vanilla-laced sugar cane, warm rain, wild-harvested spruce tips, and shimmery mermaid musk
My Thoughts: This is unique and refreshing. The cannabis is there but it's all the best parts of the flower without the stoner, if that makes sense. The grapefruit, rain, and spruce come together in a way that really feels tropical but also grounded in the PNW. Will definitely be reaching for this in warmer weather.

Area of Effect-Blupee!:Lilac, lavender, marshmallow, cream
My Thoughts: incredibly floral and clean. The lilac is more forward than the lavender. On application there is something bitter and unpleasant but it pretty quickly becomes lilac baby powder! I tried this on my husband and on him it becomes a lovely clean lavender. Skin chemistry is just so cool.

 Area of Effect-Lon Lon Milk: Cream, marshmallow, vanilla, carnation, grass, nag champa
My Thoughts: This is a scent that is best enjoyed after it's been on the skin for a bit. It's a little too sharp on application but blooms into a creamy incense with just a hint of carnation. I'm pretty sure the marshmallow is the same culprit from Blupee! giving me a bitter jab on application but again it fades pretty quickly into the incense.

Area of Effect-Stardew: Honeysuckle, peach, sweetpea, apricot, hay, corn pumpkin pie
My Thoughts: I feel like I can't quite get enough of this.it's comforting and warm in a way that feels like fall, but somehow also spring? I think the pumpkin comes through like its been oven roasted. The sweetpea is spot on to the sweetpea bouquets I'm overflowing with come summer. This is lovely. If you sit here trying to find all the mentioned notes you can, but if you just want to enjoy them as a whole? It all comes together beautifully. 10/10 my farmer would wear this. 

Area of Effect	Ms. Bumbleflower 	honeycomb, wax, carrot cake, gardenia, sweet potato, autumn breeze, cashmere, pumpkin waffles, harvest spice
My Thoughts: In the bottle this smells like some kinda yummy sweet potato cake with maybe a patch of flowers around it? On me? It's mostly cashmere, beeswax and white flowers. There is a hint of spiced sweet potato. Overall very cozy.

Astrid Perfume-Caramel Popcorn: Buttery salted popcorn, caramel
My Thoughts: This is the kind of perfume that needs a do not drink warning on it. Smells exactly like a bag of buttery kettle corn. I will be on the hunt for more buttery popcorn scents.


Lucky 9-Lucky #13: Black Cat (Pear, pink pepper, orange blossom, coffee, jasmine, bitter almond, licorice, vanilla, patchouli, cedar), bonfire smoke, pumpkin pie with a gingersnap crust with roasted marshmallows on top!
My Thoughts: There's a lot going on in this one. I'm definitely getting classic fall spices and sweet licorice. It's giving fall candle but isn't waxy at all. Maybe a little too spiced for me.

Moonalisa-Mocha Chai Cookies: Roasted Mocha coffee, and chai spices with essential oils of Cardamon, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, with swirls of nutmeg, cocoa, vanilla, and frothed cream. Rich baked cookie accord of tonka bean, sandalwood, maple sugar, rolled oats and coconut.
My Thoughts:This is reminds me of one of my favorite scents. Alkemias Misdeeds after midnight but without the salted caramel or raspberry (so pretty much nothing alike). It gives coffee shop vibes. The coconut is very light but elevates this above being an average coffee scent. It doesn't scream chai but it is perfectly spiced and doesn't give me even the slightest headache. For me it's an everyday kind of scent.

Moonalisa-Strawberry Sugar Shortcake:	Ripe juicy strawberries, crushed and rolled into sweet cane sugar. Then, gently folded into fresh whipped cream on top of a warm buttery shortcake.
My Thoughts: Starts very juicy and tart but somewhat artificial. The cake note is there but is overshadowed by the strawberry. It reminds me a bit of a strawberry chapstick or lipgloss. Incredibly long lasting on me.


Osmofolia-Dream Bean: Italian coffee beans, decadent cocoa beans, warm vanilla beans, and seductive tonka beans, with patchouli leaves, ribbons of caramel, and wafts of sandalwood incense
My Thoughts: Dry, woody, with a soft coffee note. It doesn't smell like drinking a coffee at a cafe but walking by one. Wondering if you have the time to step in for a drink but then wondering if you want a $10 drink or a new perfume. I kinda love it

Poesie-Elemental Tea Party: A swirl of autumn leaves on chilly air, brewed black tea with a discreet splash of whiskey, overturned earth, distant bonfires
My Thoughts: This is a beautiful fall tea scent. The whiskey note is subtle, and the leaves and bonfire are the stars of the show. They make a very pleasant woodsy vibe. Probably a scent I'll want to reach for more as the weather stays cool.

Poesie-Madar: Comforting, creamy Basmati rice pudding flavoured with orange flower water, saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, and dried rose petals, then piled high with sugared pistachios.
My Thoughts: This is fantastic. It's creamy and in a far better way than most perfumes can achieve on me. The rose is perfectly prominent with a soft hint of orange blossom. I'm not getting any of the spices per say but I am getting an overall delightful dessert!

Poesie-Village Bakery	: Japanese Milk Bread
My Thoughts: This smells like sweet milk bread 100% then the bread fades into a light spiced vanilla? It's giving cinnamon sugar mixed into milk and I dig it

Poesie-Sleepy Ghost: Marshmallow pillows sprinkled with natural lavender essential oil and absolute
My Thoughts: A wonderful example of an amazingly done simple perfume. It is exactly as described. And Poesie has a killer marshmallow note.

Poesie-Twice to Tea: Earl grey tea, infused with natural lavender absolute, sweetened vanilla syrup and a splash of milk
My Thoughts: This is really lovely. It's sharp and a little tingly in the nose. Does it smell like a strong cup of black tea with lavender and milk? No. Does it smell like a lovely perfume you might wear to a tea party? Absolutely 

Poesie-Green Girl: Pistachio, wildflower honey, oatmilk matcha latte, heliotrope blossoms, marshmallow musk
My Thoughts: It's definitely a Matcha Latte. Very very light throw. This pistachio doesn't work very well on me but that particular note disappears so quickly its not even an issue!

Solstice Scents-Thornwood Thicket:	Sugared Blackberries, Amber, Oud, Guaiacwood, Oakmoss
My Thoughts: Ever gone camping and eat a bunch of wild berries? But now you're covered in berry juice with no way to wash it off because you got lost in the middle of the woods?!? That's this perfume. I'm obsessed. This is both the best blackberry and wood scent I've ever tried

Solstice Scents-Lace Draped Spectre:	Vanilla Musk, Spicy Pink Carnation, Pink Pepper, Rose, White Musk
My Thoughts: I like this so much that I would scrub this scent from my memory just to experience trying it on for the first time again. It's creamy and drinkable when first applied but quickly becomes that beautiful spicy carnation. It's not quite sweet or truly spiced. Just about perfect and absolutely suits it's name.

Solstice Scents-Rose Mallow Cream: Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk
My Thoughts: On application this smelled JUST like a rose milk tea I used to be obsessed with! My skin does devour this scent.

Solstice Scents-Wilcox Potting Soil: Damp Soil, Wooden Rafters, Spicy Basil, Mossy Terracotta, Mushroom, Leaves, Stone Floor
My Thoughts: This is a TRUE garden scent. Or at least my garden. Like being wrist deep in soft black soil while you prepare a spot to transplant your basil plant. There's a soft. wood note that is the star on the dry down. This is one of those scents Ive been actively looking for.


Solstice Scents-Postprandial: Vanilla, Irish Cream, Coffee, Chocolate, Bourbon, Pipe Tobacco
My Thoughts: In the bottle this smells like an incredibly boozy delicious cocktail. On me it disappears so quickly I couldn't tell I put it on. On my husband it was a very masculine Boozy scent.

Solstice Scents- Solstice Magnolia: Daffodil, jasmine, citrus blossom, osmanthus, magnolia, cypress wood smoke, sun-warmed Earth
My Thoughts: This is the first time I've not liked something in the bottle but adored it on me. It is giving bright almost lemony summer Magnolia flowers. There's a wood note that grounds the whole experience with a warmth that my nose reads as an aged vanilla almost? I'm a big fan of Magnolia flowers so this is an instant favorite.

Solstice Scents-Chantilly Cream: Fluffy Whipped Cream, Peach Nectar, Vanilla & Yellow Mandarin
My Thoughts: This reads like a peach candle on me. But I only tried it once before bed so honestly that's probably not a fair take 

Sorce-Venus in Fleurs: Ripe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac absolute, vanilla absoluteRipe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac absolute, vanilla absolute
My Thoughts: I get less mango on the skin than in the bottle. This is mostly jasmine flowers but the single best jasmine flower I've ever smelled. This is a perfume for the floral people out there.

Sugar Spider-Softer: Honeyed pistachio, pistachio cream, roasted pistachio, sweet almonds, french vanilla 
My Thoughts: I don't have any thoughts on this one. I caught a cold before I could test this one and have had a strong case of the sniffles since. What I can smell is very strong almond extract

Loreworks Bubble Milk Tea body wash/bubble bath
My Thoughts: Fantastic gentle body wash. The scent is best experienced in a bubble bath and I will be purchasing from Loreworks when I run out.

Epically Epic Lip Balm- Strawberry Buttermilk
My Thoughts: Great lip balm with a fantastic strawberry scent.

Moonalisa Apperscotch Hair Detangler 
My Thoughts: Leaves my hair soft and smelling absolutely delectable!

I just wanted to share my amazing experience from a recent trip to Addis Ababa! I took a private city tour with Biruk, and it was excellent from start to finish.

**Here are some highlights:**

Having a **dedicated driver** made everything so convenient — we could explore attractions without worrying about parking.

**Biruk’s knowledge of the city** and its cultures is truly impressive, and he was very generous with his time and insights.

Walking through the bustling markets was a **unique experience**, and Biruk made sure it felt safe and enjoyable.

**Sampling local coffee and food was a real treat!**

The museum at the university was fascinating, and the extra stop at a pottery-making facility was a fun and unexpected bonus.

Overall, it was a fantastic way to discover Addis Ababa, and I highly recommend this tour if you're visiting.

I'm 5ft and petite, so the bigger seat space wasn't a huge deal. I also like the board at the very last minute. We started with a complimentary drink which was nice. Then, the dinner had two non meat options. I get people can't cater to veg, but the first one was a cheese plate like you can get in back and the other one had terrible reviews (mushy falafel). Wouldn't be impossible to do better.  Also (and completely my fault) I had left my pillow at the gate. I asked the flight attendant for a pillow he said they didn't have any.  I also  asked him for a blanket. He said they didn't have any blankets at all.  The other problem was none of my outlets worked. Again, I asked the flight attendant if he had a charger, but he said they didn't have any such thing. All my requests were with a please and thank you. My fully charged devices died about 3/4 in. Guy next to who insisted on using all his outlets lost one after he fell asleep. If you're a small person I really don't think first class is worth it. I did get an ice cream. That was my favorite part. So for a cup of ice cream and one alcoholic beverage I paid about $500.00. I don't know why but I also expected people to check on me and see if I wanted water coffee a snack (what happened to the cookie?)  or another drink but that never happened either.

1hqqlxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1hqqlxz/my_neighbor_perched_himself_on_top_of_a_pine_tree/,"My neighbor perched himself on top of a pine tree in my backyard and never came down. The sheriff of our small town did the same, only a day later. ","When Henry perched himself atop that pine tree, I thought he’d just lost his damn mind. No amount of convincing from Jim or the sheriff could coax him down. He ascended into the canopy and never returned.

Never returned alive, at least.

He’d always been an eccentric. It wasn’t easy living next-door to Henry, but it certainly wasn’t dull, either. Between the small city of birdhouses he maintained around the perimeter of his two-story house, the free homebrewed mead that appeared on our doorstep the first of every month, and the early morning French Horn recitals, he was a handful.

I rather liked the ongoing spectacle, all things considered. Jim never really saw the humor in Henry’s mania. That said, crippling agoraphobia has prevented me from leaving the house for almost a year now, so my threshold for what qualifies as entertainment is quite a low bar to clear.

My husband was on his way to confront Henry about his newest hobby, metal detecting, when he first scaled that twenty-foot tall pine in our backyard. It wasn’t the act of metal detecting that bothered Jim - it was the many untended holes that vexed him. The sixty-something year old found himself too lost in paroxysms of archeological fervor to bother filling the quarries back up with soil after he made them. After days of steady excavation, it looked like Henry had been sweeping his property for landmines.

That morning, Jim saw the man creeping towards the edge of the forest thirty yards from our kitchen window, and he sprung into action. If I’m recalling correctly, he shouted something like, “*I’m going to nip this in the bud*” as he jogged out the front door, which now carries a cruel cosmic irony when examined in retrospect.

The scene unfolded before me through the dusty lens of our den’s cheap telescope, which has a lovely panoramic view of the backyard and the thicket beyond from where we keep it.

As much as it pains me to admit it, fear of the space outside my house has turned me into a bit of a snoop.

Jim sauntered up to our neighbor, but Henry didn’t turn around to greet him. Nor did he stop lurching forward. He didn't even react to Jim, as far as I could tell. It was like he was moving in slow-motion autopilot. Although irritated, it wasn’t like my husband’s molten rage drove Henry to the top of that pine out of a concern for his safety.

No matter what Jim did or said, Henry remained locked in an impenetrable trance. A man on a mission.

He gave up on catching Henry’s attention by the time he had made it three quarters of the way up. As Jim started to walk back, I kept watching. Henry, the sleepwalker, never changed his pace. Each identical movement was eerily slow and deliberate. After reaching the apex, he positioned himself to face our home, extended both arms palms up in front of his chest, and became impossibly still. An unblinking gargoyle baking in the early morning summer sun.

At least, I thought he stationary.

When I checked on him an hour later through the telescope, however, he had spun his torso about thirty degrees west. Arms still extended, eyes still open, but his body had turned. Concerned and captivated in equal measure, I began observing him continuously.

While I watched, nothing seemed to change, and I was becoming progressively unnerved by his uncanny stillness. But when I paused my vigil after about twenty minutes, something occurred to me - he *was* moving. I could tell when I brought my eye away from the telescope. Looking through the den window, his torso had clearly pivoted another fifteen degrees clockwise. The motion was just so slow that I found it hard to perceive in real time.

I put my eye back to the lens of the telescope.

Henry’s skin was developing a red sheen. His unblinking eyes were dry and tinged with brown specks, like overcooked egg whites.

That’s when I called the sheriff.

The grizzled southerner and his doe-eyed deputy arrived quickly, seeing as they were only a three-minute drive down the road. They stood at the base of that pine for an hour, but couldn’t find the language to persuade Henry down either. Flustered and out of patience, the sheriff told us he would involve the fire department tomorrow if Henry remained in the tree.

When night fell, I couldn’t visualize Henry through the telescope anymore. But I could *hear* him. From our bedroom window, faintly sobbing somewhere in the blackness.

I found myself posted up in the den before the sun even rose, my mind burning with curiosity. Black coffee trickled down my throat, warming my marrow. For a moment, I felt ashamed of the excitement rumbling around in my chest.

The more I reflected on the sensation, however, the more I understood it. Journalism used to be my life before the cumulative horrors I documented manifested as a crippling fear of the world. In the grand scheme of things, this stakeout was pathetic. It didn't hold a candle to what I had done before, in a past life. But fascination, not dread, drove me to do it, and that held value.

Henry had not moved from his steeple, and by the time the sun appeared over the horizon, he had stifled his tears. His biceps were red and swollen, likely muscle breakdown from keeping them outstretched in the same position for over twenty-four hours.

A little after eight, Jim made his way downstairs. He was unusually quiet. Initially, I attributed his silence to low-level distress, secondary to Henry’s unexplained behavior. When I finally noticed him, he was standing by the front door, away from the view of our neighbor’s macabre display.

I asked him if he was doing alright, and he replied with an affirmative grunt, so I left him be.

Around noon, I felt a theory crystallize in my skull. Henry was twisting around the tree’s axis with a pace and direction identical to yesterday's. He must be watching something, I thought. That’s when it hit me.

Henry was angling his eyes and his body to constantly face the sun.

My mind scrambled to process this observation, but Jim’s heavy breathing behind me broke my concentration. It scared the shit out of me because I didn’t hear him approach. Startled, I urged him to explain what the hell he was doing.

*“Oh…fixing clock,”* he replied.

Except there was no clock. In actuality, he had his face pressed to the window that was to the right of me. He was staring at something.

I didn’t want to believe it at first. But by the afternoon, I was forced to confront the realization. From where I sat in the den, I could see Henry’s back through the telescope, and when I moved my eye away, I could see Jim’s back, silently gazing forward.

Early that morning, he had been watching the sun rise from our front door, just the same as Henry had from atop the pine tree.

My husband was following the trajectory as well.

Before I could dial 9-1-1, the sheriff and his deputy appeared in my peripheral vision. My burst of relief was short-lived when I observed how they were walking. Their footfalls were languid and protracted, the same as Henry’s had been yesterday.

As their hands contacted two different pine trees in unison, I refocused the telescope on Henry. To my horror, they were not climbing the tree where my neighbor sat to rescue him.

The possessed men were scaling their own trees, each equidistant from Henry’s.

In a state of detached shock, I moved a shaky hand to my notebook to jot down one last detail I had noticed about Henry.

Tiny mushrooms had sprouted from his eye sockets, palms and his open mouth. A robin rested on his forehead, nibbling at the growing fungus.

A wave of primal terror washed over me, and I sprinted from the chair to my front door, pausing as my hand twisted the knob.

I tried to force myself through the threshold. My head pivoted back to Jim for motivation, who hadn’t moved an inch, in spite of the noise of the chair and the telescope crashing to the floor when I sprang up.

Unable to overcome my agoraphobia, I instead sat down on the doormat and placed my head in my hands.

Whatever Henry succumbed to, it had spread to the sheriff, the deputy, and my husband. I contemplated calling 9-1-1, but what if it just spread to emergency medical services as well?

I’m not sure how long I lingered there, catatonic. The blood-chilling wails of my husband returned my consciousness to my body.

It had become night.

The absence of natural light had made Jim into a messy human puddle on the kitchen floor.

I tiptoed over to my husband, doing my best to ignore the pangs of terror vibrating in my spine. He had simply crumbled where he stood when the sun set, knelling unnaturally with his chest and torso leaning against the wall below our kitchen window.

Despite knowing he wasn’t, I asked if he was okay a handful of times, receiving no reply.

Standing over him, I tilted his shoulder, trying to see his face. Jim limply fell over in response. He was still crying softly, eyes open but producing no tears.

That’s when I noticed his chest wasn’t moving.

He wasn’t breathing.

When I found the courage to check, he had no pulse, and I lost consciousness.

I woke up a few hours later.

Through the telescope, I could see my husband perched on a pine tree of his own, arms outstretched and eyes still open. Hellish choreography modeled by Henry, mimicked by the sheriff, the deputy, and Jim.

My current theory is as follows: Henry must have accidentally unearthed something old and terrible digging holes in his backyard. A parasitic fungus lying dormant under the soil, infecting everyone who went near with inhaled spores once it was exposed.

I’m going to make it outside today. I'll grab a shovel from the garage, and I'll fill every single hole Henry made with layers of soil. Maybe I’ll survive uninfected, but I suspect I will succumb to whatever this thing is as well.

But it’s the least I can do to honor Jim’s memory.

I’m taking the time to document and post this for two reasons.

First and foremost, don’t end up like me. I hid from the world because it felt safer. But it wasn’t safer, it was just easier, and I wasted precious time.

Secondly, if you see anyone perched on a tree, eyes following the trajectory of the sun, burn the tree down or run. Whatever you do, cover your mouth.

Because that robin ate some of the fungus that grew from Henry, and may disseminate the spores as far as it can fly.

The start of its life cycle? It’s unclear, and I think that, unfortunately, the world may have an answer to that question in a few days.

Also, for the past few years, I've done easy-to-moderately paced hikes of roughly 7-10 miles (mainly, but not always, with no elevation gains/losses) weekly or biweekly.



3 weeks ago, I began incorporating twice weekly HIIT sessions - mainly to improve my cardiorespiratory system for my hikes.  My HIIT sessions consist of 5 minute warm up walking, 20 minutes alternating 60 seconds running (more like jogging but I get out of breath and my heart rate climbs to the low-to-mid 170s \[for reference I'm 38 years old\]), and 90 seconds walking, followed by a 5 minute cooldown walk, and then stretching.



So my current workout schedule is: Mon: strength training, Tues: HIIT, Wed: easy active recovery/rest, Thurs: strength training, Fri: HIIT, Sat: easy active/recovery/rest, Sun: hike.

  
I try to eat a pretty balanced mix of protein (non-animal sources), carbs, and fat, both before and after workouts.  I drink a good amount of water (and coffee, TBH), and don't drink alcohol (I drank enough in my 20s and early 30s to last me a life time).  I sleep a good 8ish hours every night.

I'm feeling physically and mentally fatigued, and am getting quite irritable, which I feel awful about - I don't want to be snippy with people.  This really began the past few days.

My first time playing this game was 1/24, I still have a couple of days before it makes it official of me playing this game for 1 whole year. I only got into Eversoul a couple of days after getting into Guardian Tales as I ran out of coffee. Me, thinking because they were own by the same company that they were from the same creator and boy was I wrong with that. I ended up making a bet to no life this game to see why at the time the Kakoe games even had this and the difficulty of this game is.

**Story**  
I initially despise Eversoul because I just didn't feel the same weight about my Journey as most Gacha games I played example Brave Frontier, Chain Chronicles, Tales of the Link and Guardian tales, etc., and I'm only referring to the beginning of the story and how interactive it made the player. As time went by and more of the story came out, I grew to like them more and had more of understanding of world of Eversoul. **Please note that this was before the rewrite.** **Difficulty of Story battle:** **0/5**

**Mechanics**  
This has to be one of the most annoying parts of the game because most guides I try to find didn't really cover everything but rather just parts of it. Unfortunately I had to do more digging personally to find the answer I was looking for a bit tad late so was really annoyed that I found my efficiency for this game got reduce because I was missing key component of info that was very crucial to proceed for later content of this game and current. **Tdlr: Knowledge about the game mechanics and economy is power. Difficulty: 4/5**

This has to be one of the interesting interactive I myself had since now we are dealing with each girl personally, getting to know them past, present and future along with learning about who they are as a soul. When I had to deal with the tower with my souls with no kind of enhancements to make them strong just level only this was very challenging in itself in the beginning of my journey thinking that it would be easy as the story and boy was I wrong. If you have low ascension and no enhancements at all this tower will be very challenging but if you know what your doing then this should be a breeze. Watch out for Jacqueline. **Difficulty: 2/5**

**Evil Soul Subjugation**  
This was a very refreshing idea I would never thought of seeing in were we have a ""what if/yet to happened"" scenario for other characters that isn't you the MC and what would happened in those scenarios. My first was Vivienne but I didn't really understand exactly much about it since I hardly participated since I was very under level. I really got into it once the second subjugation arrive Adrianne the concept, design, OST and how she interacted with your souls made the stakes and your involvement for this feel very thrilling and interesting to learn more about the concept of each individual Evil Soul. That being said, to take them on in higher tier as a beginner this will be a very demanding since it will require a bunch of resource, time and knowledge to make this happen till then your most likely just going to be able to do the lower levels till then. **Difficulty: 3/5**

**Event Story**  
These are fun side story to go through tho I don't really know where they fall in the story? If at all but if anyone knows let me know. Till then I guess these are just fillers for now. Really enjoyed going with the souls in there adventure but other than that the battle aren't as difficult but just like I said about being a beginner there could be some problems depending on the level and enhancements your souls have. This only pertains to Event story that have Raid Battle and Stages after completing the event story.**Difficulty: 1/5**

**Operation Eden Alliance**  
Now for any beginner this can definitely be another demanding task because now in order to get more points to place higher you need to handicap yourself the higher tier of handicap the better for you to obtain all the resource that you can get in this event but as a beginner this can be very challenging in itself until you get more resource, time and knowledge. **Difficulty: 2/5**

**Guild Raid**  
I personally join the first Guild I found didn't really care much but if the raid does offer extremely valuable reward that at first you wouldn't pay to much in mind but they are very important for most content that you will participate as in it will make your life easier but as a beginner this has to be the same as Evil Soul Subjugation in terms of resource, time and knowledge because this doesn't have a entry level it just throws you into the battle so surviving will be your best bet and whatever damage you deal to it is better than nothing. Once you get more resource to deal with this it should be way easier for you. **Difficulty: 2/5**

**Gate Breakthrough**  
This has to be if not one of the most repetitive and annoying to go through as a beginner just know that it's the same concept resource, time and knowledge. **Difficulty 2/5**

**Depth Stage**  
If you haven't gotten to a certain part of Battlefront boy oh boy do I have something for you. If you thought regular Gate Breakthrough was annoying you haven't try Depth Stage not only is it repetitive but more harder cause now they have keepsake and you need 3 teams for Unlimited Gate and 2 teams specific gate so if you have don't have enough resource given to particular teams or overall souls then I really don't know what to tell you since this section I didn't complete till Nov.-Dec. so yea good luck with that section. **Difficulty 3/5**

**Decoy Operation**  
This one should be easy for beginner till Stage 15 depending on what penalty and bonus penalty is in play for you in that specific day. I personally jump in at the highest I can do and then check in every day until there was a penalty that didn't hurt my chance to go higher but that being said the hard part is after stage 15 because now they have keepsake and can use Ultimate so now they will show you no mercy and this can make all the difference in how fast and more content you can clear depending on how much effort you put in to get Stage 25 Clear **without** a friend so you can sweep. I was able to clear this section within my 5-6 months in as a beginner but even then it was difficult like no other. For both Mana and Keepsake Operation. **Difficulty: 4/5**

**Dimensional Labyrinth & Hall of Memories**  
These were more tedious then anything even as beginner but don't be scare challenging higher level as you are able to get boost items to help your souls and bring friends I was able to clear most of these high level with ease in a couple of months and had faster access to more resource for that reason to this accelerate my growth as soul master by a large margin. **Difficulty: 2/5**

**World Boss & Iridescent Scenic Instance**  
I really can't comment much about this since this was introduce all late and by then I had a bunch more resource then what you would have as a beginner so can't really rate this or tell you what your looking for just good luck and participate to get some resource.

**Arena**  
This is where you want to participate the most to get some good amount of **Everstone.** I participated when I was a beginner and still do to this day. I gotten to high ranking with my low levels souls so participate and get to the highest you can in here so you can later down the road have more souls. Very friendly and useful. **Difficulty: 2/5**

**Champs Arena**  
This is where it's not friendly and brutal because whatever ranking you have, is your passive income of Everstone and the thing is you need 3 teams and any body can challenge you for your spot so if your teams aren't solid then this can be very annoying. Like right now I have one particular player taking my spot and we go back and forth this player had to grind for manastone and get there souls to Lv. 436 to even beat my Lv. 321 as you can see this more about knowledge, resource and time rather than level. **Difficulty: 4/5**

**Battlefront**  
This is fairly easy for beginner from 1-18 once you get to 19-31 this can get tricky because of the requirement of a 3 teams and let me tell you depending on the Souls you use there will be certain souls you will have a burning passion of hatred to go up against because they are higher tier level and sometimes the damage isn't really there at times and it will take several attempts I finished all of this with low level 321 because I put the time, resource and knowledge in play. **Difficulty: 3/5**

**Battlefront Challenge**  
For this it will get tedious and repetitive in the sense that you will have to be constantly getting out manually to change something between your souls as a beginner because they won't allow you in the selection screen and depending what souls you have this can be a breeze or this can be a nightmare depending on your knowledge as well. **Difficulty 3/5**

**Overall I had fun playing this game myself despite how annoying it was to maneuver through all this even tho certain things I learn a bit late otherwise I think I would had flourish my account even more than I have now, once the year is complete I'll show exactly how a no life** **free to play who manage almost everything would look like in a year.**

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I have arthritis, I'm pre-diabetic, and I have a rare and fatal disease (primary sclerosing cholangitis) that my doctor says gets significantly worse very quickly when patients tip the scale into ""obese"" which is the line I'm hovering over right now. 

My normal weight is around 140 which is in a healthy range for my height and id like to get back to it. 

I gained the weight slowly over 3 ish years, I think mostly because of drinking what I think is too much alcohol for me, eating cheaply because we ran into financial issues,  having a baby (my third but with an age gap of 11 years) and breastfeeding for two years. Also higher stress, and lower physical activity, and poor sleep for an extended time, and I have not paid attention to my eating for the past few years.

I weigh 183, and hope to stay around 130-145.   

I used to be very active and have never been overweight until recently. I used to do intermittent fasting, and ate whole foods, didn't eat junk food, didn't snack, and didnt drink calories other than a glass of red in the evening and sometimes a little orange juice with breakfast or a splash of cream in my coffee, never cared much for sugar but ate pasta or bread and butter every day. I ate intuitively but tried to fill my home with healthy food.

I plan to go back to those habits, but is it enough?  Everyone is saying that I need to be in a calorie deficit to lose weight. Since I've never had to lose fat before, I have a hard time accepting that information, and id like to know what others think.

He planned everything, bought the tickets, put gas in the car, and even brought me coffee in bed to wake me up for it. However, about halfway through the movie, I started to smell his breath. I perceived it as very pungent (like he must’ve gone at least 24 hours without brushing his teeth). However, to be fair, I was very hungry, which heightened my sense of smell, and there were some other people near-ish to us who didn’t seem to smell it. I stopped cuddling with him, leaned away a bit in my chair, and tried to just breathe through my mouth, but I was very uncomfortable until I began to physically plug my nose. I stayed like that the rest of the movie.

Afterwards, he asked me why I was plugging my nose. I tried to dance around it, but eventually he asked directly if it was him, and I said yes. He completely deflated. He will barely speak to me now and seems both angry and embarrassed.

(We have also had some other conflicts recently about him not keeping up his hygiene, health, and appearance, so this is one piece of a bigger puzzle.)

I can’t tell if I was being bratty and ungrateful and should’ve just hidden my reaction, (especially since it’s my fault I went to the movie so hungry), or if he was disrespectful to not brush his teeth beforehand and thus shouldn’t be angry with me for my reaction.

An election after which a certain convicted a\*\*hole is set to return to the White House with a vengeance. That doesn't mean that M&A has continued to thrive, albeit mildly. So as 2024 draws to a much anticipated close, let's look back on some of the biggest M&A moments in media this year, and what's to come in the new year, shall we?

# Paramount and Skydance Media merge

Any media buff will probably know going into 2024 that the most vulnerable of the ""big five"" majors was inevitably gonna be Paramount Global, the cornerstone of the Redstone media empire, home to one of the oldest studios in Holywood, CBS, Star Trek, Spongebob, and a storied collection of cable TV brands, but had been trailing somewhat with their own streamer, Paramount+, which was so small Amazon and Apple had it as an add-on subscription.

To this end, as the year began, it was widely assumed that Warner Bros. Discovery would make their game-changing move with Paramount, but they pulled out of the running in February, citing numerous factors including a possible overlapping of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, from my own opinion and theories. As the year went on though? Well, enter Skydance Media, a production company with historic ties with the Paramount studio, ran by David Ellison, who is the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and was apparently mentored behind the scenes by Paramount chairwoman Shari Redstone to one day take her place at the reins (hence why she stubbornly rejected other bids). On July 8, Skydance announced their intention to merge with the media giant, with the hopes of supercharging CBS, ramping up AI efforts on future productions, and giving Paramount an additional line of output in video games, among other ambitious expansions.

With this, Skydance Media has accomplished an unbelieveable feat for a production company on the brink of diversification. While it remains to be seen as to how Ellison's reigime will go, it's a bit unclear if Ellison will intend to pursue m&A deals for New Paramount and revamp Paramount+ big time, unless the new company continues to struggle.

# Lionsgate and Starz complete their split

For a while now, Lionsgate has been considered as being in a vulnerable state, especially given its leading mini-major status. After years of speculation and theories, as well as the infamous distraction that was buying core parts of Entertainment One off the equally struggling Hasbro, the long-anticipated split of Lionsgate created two new entities: Starz Entertainment and Lionsgate Studios.

On the film side of things following the split, things would get worse from there. *Borderlands*. *The Crow*. *Megalopolis*. What do those three movies have in common you ask? They were THREE tentpole movies within Lionsgate's 2024 movie slate, all of whom BOMBED and BOMBED hard. No good, no good at all for Hollywood's leading mini-major studio, especially after the eOne purchase added to the weight.

To me, both resulting companies will struggle going into the first year of their existence. Starz has no in-house IP, from what I've discovered, which is bound to make things more sour. Lionsgate Studios, though? If they continue to struggle, they're gonna be struggling like hell to exist as a mini-major for much longer, so buyers may wanna use this opportunity to rise up.

# NBCUniversal plans spinoff of cable networks

Let's be honest here: Comcast, the proud owner of NBCUniversal and Sky, has had a polarising place in the media industry in recent times. Aside from the second most powerful film studio and a thriving theme park portfolio, it's been more mixed on the TV and streaming front, especially on an international level. Just look at MOST of the cable networks of the company, which have basically been stripped of any original programming since the Peacock streaming service became a thing. This was, in fact, the main reason why Comcast shocked everyone when they announced they were spinning off networks like USA Network, Syfy, E!, Oxygen, CNBC, MSNBC and Golf Channel, as well as NBCU's stake in Fandango, into a standalone public company.

However, this has left me with more questions. What puzzles me here is the fact that Bravo has been miraculously spared - due to the fact its programming was somehow essential to Peacock. Another thing too, there needs to be answers as to the fate of NBCUniversal International Networks, which operates Universal TV in some countries. As it turns out, cable channels are more profitable internationally than in the US, which is irritating given changing viewing habits, and the fact that Disney has been axing channels outside of the US one-by-one as it rolled out Disney+ worldwide. Well, all we can do at the moment is speculate...

# Vivendi (sort of) splits and an independent Canal+ is born

It's amazing how Vivendi has become one of France's largest conglomerates... until the point you realise they spent the last decade, especially after feeding Universal Studios to NBC, they've has varying levels of triumph, depending on the specific asset in its portfolio. The writing was on the wall back in 2016 after it failed to buy Ubisoft from the Guilermots after divesting whatever stake it owned in Activision Blizzard three years prior. And of course, who can ever forget when it foresaked its decades-long ownership of Universal Music as that company would begin a process that culminated in it hitting it big on the stock exchange?

These divestures all culminated in a lengthy process which came to a head when Vivendi announced its intention to split into multiple standalone companies: Canal+, Havas, and Louis Hachette Group, in addition to a heavilly reduced Vivendi, which would focus on investments. This move was clearly inevitable, especially considering Canal+'s recent acquisition spree, and StudioCanal's own growth as a European studio. Now with its place on the stock exchange, we can expect Canal+, as a brand, to get more global recognition it deserves.

# DirecTV acquires Dish Network (AND FAILS SPECTACULARLY)

Ever since streaming became a thing, linear TV has been a hard thing to come by. Dish Network, one of the leading satellite TV providers in America and owners of Sling TV and the Blockbuster brand, learned this the hard way when AT&T defector DirecTV offered to acquire Dish from its parent company Echostar, a deal that was ditched a month later after shareholders from the latter apparently opposed it.

That M&A fail just shows how unrealistic some view mergers, and how customers would react if the worst ever happened. To be fair, linear TV providers are gonna be having a tough time navigating declining users as they embrace cord-cutting. I do remember when I theorised a scenario in which Liberty Global acquired DirecTV instead and brought it under the Virgin Media name, which would have been a tad bit more realistic than what they attempted. DirecTV must have thought that private equity firms like their owner TPG believe that money grows on trees....

# Embracer Group splits into three

In recent gaming history, there have been very few shocking rises and falls than that of Embracer. Once, it went from saving THQ from the brink, and seemed like an unstoppable M&A force, and then... an cash injection from the Saudi Arabian PIF's gaming unit, Savvy Media Group dramatically collapsed, which spelled dangerous repercussions.

In order to save themselves, the once-promising gaming behemoth rapidly descended into crisis mode, as CEO Lars Wingefors scrambled to save money, and in doing so, scrapped games, closed down studios (including Volition, makers of Saint's Row), and even sold off a few assets, including Saber Interactive.

Which brings us to the outcome of months of chaos. So the three companies resulting from this yet-to-be-completed split are...

* Asmodee Group (board games)
* ""Coffee Stain & Friends"" (name not final; AA games and indie games)
* ""Middle-Earth Enterprises & Friends"" (name not final; AAA games and major IP)

In all honesty, I can see those three new companies as sale targets, for example, Hasbro could buy Asmodee, while it should be noted that Amazon has voiced their interest in buying Embracer, or what remains of it.

# Sony acquires Alamo Drafthouse Cinema

Anyone remember the 1948 Paramount Case? That's right, the fallout from this infamous lawsuit forbade major studios from owning movie theatre chains, especially Paramount, which owned the United Paramount Theatres chain. Well, apparently in 2020, the government abolished the Paramount Decree that banned studios from owning theatres, giving hope that conglomerates can one day buy movie theatre chains. Sony was the first studio to put themselves forward and give that freedom a test run, when they bought the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema chain in June. This may give us some renewed hope that Amazon could do the same if they wanted to.

# Fremantle acquires Asacha Media Group

Let's face it, one overlooked arena in media in recent years is the ream of ""super-indies"" non-studio-owned television production studios with portfolios of scripted and unscripted content up their roof. Banijay has undoubtedly been the unexpected driving force of breakneck M&A, but then there's Fremantle, the RTL Group-owned global TV studio, which has been on a rough acquisition spree in its own right. The biggest target it's landed so far, this little France-based studio with additional labels in the UK called Asacha Media Group. Controversially though, Fremantle chose to continue operating Asacha as a satellite company within itself with very little integration. But, that could very soon change.

# Mediawan acquires Leonine Studios

Speaking of ""super-indies"", another one that has gained some recognition globally is another French studio Mediawan, which has amassed a good chunk of TV labels across Europe, and that's not to mention light broadcasting businesses in its native France. Their biggest move so far came this past April, however, when they acquired German mini-major distributor Leonine Studios, which stems from fellow KKR-backed company Leonine Holding (the successor of Universum Film GmbH and Tele Munchen Gruppe). To better understand their synergies, one must learn that they had a JV once known as ""Mediawan & Leonine Studios"".

# Looking ahead...

As 2024 draws to an inevitable close, let's see what the new year has in store for us. I have been informed that nothing much will happen, but in media, it should go without saying, but nothing is predictable, and with that moron returning to the white house, the regulatory atmosphere will probably be less strict - unlike Democrat administrations, which is good news for anybody. Here's what could possibly happen this coming year in the world of media...

* The Paramount-Skydance merger closes, and speculation mounts on what happens next, and whether or not they pursue M&A deals
* NBCU finally spins off most of its cable assets, while Comcast contemplates rolling out Peacock in other territories
* The fate of Warner Bros. Discovery wrests on the shoulders of how James Gunn's Superman performs financially and critically
* Sony continues to search obsessively for more IP
* Media giants seek more M&A freedom from the greedy cult that is the second Trump adminstration
* Disney contemplates shutting down Hulu as a standalone service and moving its content to Disney+.

Looking back at how we've grown as a subreddit, and as one family of users with a common interest at heart, I'd say it's been a swift year of change for the Future of Media Network as a whole. We had to say goodbye to r/AlternateMediaHistory due to a severe lack of moderation, but we've proudly (mostly) reinstated alternate-reality M&A on this sub. And looking back at the September 28 incident which affected several FOM discord users like me, it's clear we need to learn lessons from this and stay safe online so our values are not quashed by the minds of delusional hackers. For the scenario side of things, it's been a wild ride, especially when speculating about Paramount's destiny.

1hqq7dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huel/comments/1hqq7dk/the_hs_pots_rock_story_time_suggestions/,The H&S pots rock! Story time + Suggestions.  ,"I’m probably in the minority on the sub but I think the single serve format for H&S is a much needed improvement and I’m glad they’re leaning into it. I remember being excited for the OG H&S launch and bought the max number of bags (back when bulk discounts were a thing) out of pure hype. Unfortunately, most of it sucked (yo, that OG sweet n’ sour was a crime against humanity) though there was some ‘good’ flavors (Mexican chili and coconut curry are fine). I ended up throwing out maybe $500 of product. I still love the concept and so I gave it another shot maybe a year or two later when they added new textures and flavors. Some of it was a tolerable mediocre, but most of it still sucked (I honestly found it rather amusing how badly y’all managed to fuck up pasta and red sauce. I also thought the mac n’ cheese was borderline inedible but I guess those are fighting words here). That was another few hundred dollars I quite literally threw away (which actually doesn’t really bother me that much. At this point, I feel like I’m personally funding R&D for a product I hope eventually works). 

H&S has consistency issues and it’s the same problem TWICE for each serving. First there’s the consistency of the dry huel itself, then there’s just good ol’ user error with how much water to put in to get the right ratio —which is a bug that was pitched to us like a feature. Seriously dude, I don’t want the water/huel ratio to be modular based off my “personal preference”; I want it done right and I don’t want to have to think about it.  When was the last time you went to a restaurant, ordered pasta/noodles/curry/whatever and the waiter hits you the follow up question of “and how hydrated would you like that today?” 

Anyways, the first half of the H&S problem was solved with the single serve pots. This got me excited yet again and I ordered the maximum amount of these goddamn pots (which either makes me a refined patron of the sciences or a moron). Luckily, the Korean BBQ was actually good (HOPE AT LAST) and the spicy goo-whateverthefuck was fine, tho the Alfredo was absolutely diabolical. Dear god, I felt like I was getting punked or some shit; that one felt like cracking open a can of soda and somehow drinking milk. 

Anyways, that’s enough with flavor feedback. Let’s get to the reason for the post: the second half of the H&S problem.

The fill line is a struggle for me. Like am I trippin’ or is this a bad system? Do I fill it up to the line then stir? Or do I go halfway, stir, then fill the rest of the way to the fill line? If I fill it up to the stir line but don’t disturb the huel, I’m adding in random chance into the mix for how much wet/dry integration happens during the pour; the variation of how much water gets poured using this method is maybe like an ounce and a half (Imperial) or about a shot glass (‘Merica). But if I fill partway, mix it to get 100% wet/dry integration, then fill up to the line, then it’s too much water

Also, it’s the middle of my work day and I’ve got shit to do. Like bro I work at an urgent care, I’m lucky if I have time to take a bathroom break before 6pm. Why do I feel like I’m back in undergrad chem lab trying to find the exact level of the meniscus in a beaker flask and contemplating the significant figures of my measurements? And all while under a time constraint??

Fuck that (and my old o-chem TA too btw), I’m just gonna have some black coffee and move on. I pop a k-pod in the Keurig, take said bathroom break, and grab the finished cup of coffee as I walk back to the treatment area to go see the next patient. 

Later while charting the eleventh J22 of the day and sipping on my coffee, I have an epiphany. Huel H&S + Keurig. Would it work? Why wouldn’t it work?

When I get home, I look online to see if anyone has tried it. I find nothing but there is a ‘life hack’ fad that seems to pop up every few years of people making their OG cup-of-noodles with a Keurig.

Close enough. 

I look at the Keurig volume settings and see how much water is supposed to go in the Huel pot to see if they match. Indeed, the 6oz setting on the Keurig corresponds exactly with the 3/4 cup recommendation for Huel HS (\*smirks in ‘Merica realizing that the UK uses imperial measurements, even when using their tea-and-crumpet ass kettles\*).

I get to work the next day to try it and… IT FUCKING WORKS. Beautifully even, it was the best serving of Korean BBQ I’ve had to date. And the best part is I didn’t have to do a damn thing. I pressed a button, walked off, and came back a few minutes later to perfectly poured Huel. Stirred it around a couple times and that was it. Both halves of the H&S problem solved: The ratios of both wet and dry components went into the finished product exactly as the product engineers intended. 



I don’t know if this ability to retrofit to Keurig style coffee machines was intentional on Huel’s part or if it’s just a happy accident but I really think Huel should lean into this. People who use Keurigs are literally the same customer demographic that Huel is trying to target with these pots: the person who can’t be bothered to go out of their way for coffee/lunch but is willing to pay extra for the convenience factor of a single serve product while at home/work (with no dishes). And if the majority of this American customer base already has access to a Keurig (or similar single serve coffee maker), why not go where the customer already is?  Get rid of the kettle instructions and slap on the Keurig instructions. Rebrand the same product and it’s suddenly way better. If you’re willing to pay for the Keurig brand name attached a marketing campaign, you may even get wider adoption of the product here in the USA. 

As an American, I’ve never cared for the kettle instructions on Huel H&S anyways (I honestly don’t think I’ve ever seen an electric kettle in real life). Even if I had a kettle, you really think I’m gonna wait around for it to heat the water up, use a measuring cup to get the perfect amount of near-boiling water, and then pour it into the pot? Fat chance. The nutritional science of Huel is neat (revolutionary if I’m being candid) and the UK can have their kettles but in America, convenience is king. I want to press a button and be done with it. And I want to consistently receive the same quality product. Every time. That’s how you get people to happily pay $5 per serving, day after day on subscription. 



**TL;DR: Single serve H&S is its only viable option but only solves half of the H&S problem. Kettles are stupid. Convenience is king. Huel H&S + Keurig. ‘Merica** 🇺🇸



Also, while I have your attention, I’d like to once again request single serve huel chips for the US. MAJHA (Make. American. Junk. Healthy. A first time?) Create a savory version of the powder, press it into chips, bake it, and stack ‘em up like Pringles in a cardboard/paper cylinder. You have sweet; you have savory; you have chewy. Next, we (I) want crunchy. Keep it to an even 200 kcal (\*acquiesces in ‘Merica\*); the 180 kcal of the bar is annoying. 

Lastly, happy New Years and go Team Huel! I know tone of this post has been both flippant and on the more critical side but I do love the core of your company’s mission (well the first 3 things at least) and have been a hueligan for several years now, though I’m not particularly active online. At the risk of coming off as a dick, I generally choose to show my support with my wallet more than my words. After seeing the changes coming to H&S and subsequently making the above described discovery while it was on my mind, I actually *restarted* my H&S subscription, the pots in particular. I was surprised to come online and see all the backlash against the upcoming changes, so I wanted to take some time to semi-publicly give my 2 cents. I’m excited to try the Japanese noodles and whatever else is in the pipeline for the USA. ",5,1735686042.0,Huel,3,1.0,False
1hqq7by,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqq7by,I work at a wind powered sawmill in the Netherlands,"Hi guys, new to Reddit! Wanted to share some of my woodworking projects. Used to live and work in New York for nearly all my life. Last job was as director of prototyping for a very large furniture manufacturer in Brooklyn. We prototyped all kinds of furniture, I did woodworking, welding, 3-D printing, pretty much everything to get a sample done. Now I volunteer at a wind powered sawmill in the Netherlands. I share the traditional bread and cheese sandwiches and black coffee with some really great Dutch friends and a cat! Three days a week I get up very early in the morning to help set the sails and turn it to the wind. For reference, I go to the gym, do Muay Thai and Jiu-Jitsu, but cranking the top of the mill towards the wind is probably the hardest workout there is!

Zooble 

They were probably in a band as the drummer. They die their hair often, resulting in their hair not being the healthiest. 

The reason I gave them a prosthetic was because their removable parts in the show. I meant to give them a prosthetic leg as well, but was too far into coloring to change it 😅

———————————————————————————

Gangle

I wasn't really sure what to do for Gangle, I don't really know too much about her to come up with a more complex design.. 

But, I do believe she tends to hide her true emotions. Often masking, even though the mask often slips when she doesn't intend it to. 

She's had many different jobs before she was transported into the circus, like shift manager, customer service, and before she entered the circus, teacher. She had a side job as an artist, but her commissions didn't do well.

Ragatha

I didn't really change her much, that wasn't intentional but I personally think she looks decent. 

I tried giving her some southern girl vibes, based on her lines ""I miss my horses.."" 

She was probably a rancher, or ran a farm, hence the boots and gloves. 

She probably enjoys sewing and knitting, and has actually made the dress she's wearing. 

Her favorite movie is  Raggedy Ann and Andy :)

Jax

I don't really have a full fledged story for Jax, I didn't really think of it if I'm gonna be fully honest. I just went off vibes for him. He's still the same in the real world as he is in the virtual world. 

I gave him acne cause.. do you really expect him to take care of his skin.. 

He likes to dye his hair, but not often. He's a dirty blonde underneath. 

He's probably had a rabbit or two as well.

—————————————————————————

Kinger 

I kept his design simple, as I feel like he wouldn't dress fancy unless it's for a special occasion. He's a major geek, really into computer science, likes playing chess, and has a bug collection. 

Since she was the one to make him like them, bugs often remind him of his wife. 

I personally think he was the first one to ever enter the circus. I believe he was one of the ones to work on it. I do think he wanted to check the new software out with his wife, and that's why Queenie was there.

Pomni

I wasn't sure AT ALL what to do for her so I did my best. I did like I did Jax, went off vibes and didn't really come up with a background. 

She drinks coffee often to help her get through the day.

I cannot figure out what the hell it’s from. I woke up in the morning feeling a little off (but also had very little sleep— thanks toddler). Then I had a few donut holes from a local place, along with a Vietnamese coffee. My husband ate from the same batch of donut holes, and shared some of my coffee. I then had some smoked cheese, homemade sourdough slices (toasted) and pre-packaged salami. The salami package had 3 different kinds in it — all pre-sliced. The night before, my dad, husband and I all ate from the pack. Then day of, My husband ate the same stuff from the same plate, but only ate 2 of the 3 kinds of salami. I ate the third one. Is it possible for just some of the salami to have been infected? I just can’t think of any other thing that would’ve made me so sick. Within 2 hours of eating it I had heartburn (which is highly unusual for me) and then the explosion ensued within about 30 minutes of the heartburn.",1,1735685960.0,foodsafety,0,0.67,False
