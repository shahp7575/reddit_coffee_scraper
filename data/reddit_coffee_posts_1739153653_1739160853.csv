- nutrition, 

- physiology, 

- world affairs, conspiracies, 

- life in Vancouver, 

- those unfriendly, flakey locals ;) 

- intuitive guidance for fitness, cooking, healing, 

- NDEs (se llaman ECMs), life purpose

- meditative practises, manifestation

- Gregg Braden material in connection to human origins, ancient aliens

you get the idea. 

I understand YT vids on topics above by 97-98% (usually at 100%) that is why I am primarily interested in native speakers. Not interested in ""study buddies"", I can learn much faster on my own. Nor am I looking for tutors, or penpals. 

We will be chatting on the phone first (facetime audio or whatsapp audio are also OK) and once the weather warms up a bit I will restart my walks at Stanley Park. You can join me if you like however I am not keen on hanging out with complete strangers without prior interaction. So focus on building some dialogue with me first. 

A question that often pops up with these types of arrangements: Can you teach me English? Yes and No: I can answer specific questions about English but don't expect me to be your step by step English instructor. I am looking for friends, not commercial transactions.

One caveat just so you know ahead of time: Sometimes I don't understand jokes. When it comes to jokes in Spanish my comprehension rate can go down to 70-80%, and that is where your sense of humor will come handy. :)

Put some effort into your response por favor... Don't just scribble a half liner like most peeps do in this sub and expect me to be interested in you. Introduce yourself. Elaborate on what drew you to this ad, what makes you think we'll get along, what do we have in common...? Feel free to PM me in Spanish. 

Few personal details: 
I live d/t. I don't consume alcohol or drugs. I make my own coffee. I don't believing in wasting time & money in overpriced coffee shops. I live a very minimalistic and anti consumer lifestyle, most items I own are second hand. Also I believe tipping is one of the most annoying, misused and distorted social trends and if it were up to me, I would abolish it. So there.

1ilxhcr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilxhcr,I’m just so tired. I know he’s not as abusive as many but this is slowly killing me. AIO or AITA?," AITA for thinking my (39F) husband (42M) is being selfish and childish?

A little backstory:
I was up all night (til 7am) like I am often because we have puppies and senior dogs that need frequent potty breaks and attention. I also have schoolwork to do and chores and maybe even a little me time that I can’t get during the day because my husband is always there and has high demands of my time. 
He works 530am to 4pm and wants dinner at 4 everyday. Then he usually falls asleep by like 6pm and wakes up around 12-3 am. I’m expected to make sure he has food and be up to let him hang out with the dogs and etc. 
We live in a house with my mom and sis, and he stays exclusively in his office or our room. He has a micro and fridge and etc. in his office and I keep him stocked up on food. (Soup. Sandwiches. Cereal. Oatmeal. Burritos. Yogurt. Water. Coffee. Drinks. Etc.)
Because he needs to sleep and the dogs are not prone to follow his schedule of sleep, I’m up u til he wakes up in the am and then usually have to make him food and etc. then I get to sleep. 
Last night I got to sleep at 7am. He was sleeping on my pillow and blanket and sprawled across our king size bed and I couldn’t even sit down. I tried to wake him enough for him to move but he didn’t. 

I explained all of this to him when I woke up at TEN AM. For my religious meeting. Afterward I made him some food and etc but I was SO tired. I have health issues and the stress is killing me. When I woke up 2pm he was pissed at me (it’s his day off and he was playing video games. )
 
So I cried and slept alone for about an hour then I went to Panera to study and get out the house (which he had told me I should do before he got mad at me)

I am writing this after a lot of thinking as I am someone who is very hesitant to share things. Please sit through this although this is not a short read. :)



Hey, I’m 23M and in a relationship with my girlfriend (21F) of about 1.5 years. I’m feeling really conflicted and I need some advice.
To give you a bit of background, things were good at first, but after moving in together after just 2 months of dating, things have started to go downhill. The main issue is her behavior and constant need for my attention. She doesn’t like hanging out with my friends, she doesn’t get close to my family, and she has an issue with me doing things on my own (even things as simple as watching a movie or listening to a song by myself). If I go out with my friends, she refuses to join and makes a scene about it. She gets mad if I want to do anything solo, even if she doesn’t want to participate.

Things started to get tense when she found out about certain private details from my past, which I didn't openly share at the beginning of our relationship. I’m not trying to hide anything from her; I just tend to keep some things private. It's not about past relationships or virginity—we’re both aware of each other’s pasts and are mature about that. But the issue is that she brings up these private details during arguments to try to win, calling me names and using them as ammunition. The fights are always extreme, with lots of silent treatment and sulking from her. I’ve even apologized to her for things I didn’t think I did wrong just to avoid more fights.

One example of her action that caused a lot of trouble: We ran into an old friend(my friend)  at a coffee shop and we were invited over to his house (for the first time in over a year, since I never got to hang out with my friends much while living with her). But when we got into the car and was about to go, she said she’s not coming saying that my friend didn’t specifically invite her . I tried explaining that he meant to invite us both (although he  didn’t specifically speak to her, we both were there) but she threw a tantrum, and I ended up apologizing to her for something I didn’t feel I did wrong.

At home, I do most of the chores, cooking, and cleaning. We originally agreed that she would cook, and I’d clean, but that’s shifted to me doing about 70% of the household duties. I wanna add that its not like she insists me on doing it alone always its just that if i don’t take initiative it wont never get donr. She’ll only pitch in only if she absolutely feels like she has to.  I do appreciate that she helps me out financially when I’m struggling, and she’s not stingy with her money, but the imbalance of responsibilities is wearing me down.

I also drive her to and from work 90% of the time, even though she can drive herself, and I always plate and serve her food. She’s very harsh and opinionated, and she gets defensive whenever we disagree, especially about things I want to do outside of our relationship (hobbies, friends, my network). I feel like she wants to control my life and have me with her 24/7, and it’s draining. I love her, but I feel like she’s stifling my independence, and I’m starting to feel resentful.

I really believe part of her problem is that she still acts like a child, she wants to be taken care of like one. Sometimes i feel like I am her caretaker or something. She lacks some major life skills and I pick up the slack  is I believe whats happening. 

The real issue now is that due to work circumstances, we won’t be able to stay together starting next month, and I want to use this as an opportunity to take a step back, focus on myself, finish my degree, and think things through. She is not happy about this idea at all and insists that we should stay together, even though it would financially hurt her. When I told her that I need space for a while, she blew up at me and it turned into another big fight with screaming and silent treatment. After a couple of days, she’s somewhat okay with it, but I’m still unsure. She says that if I go through with it, we’re done—though I don’t believe her, I’m still worried that this is a turning point in our relationship. I’m on the fence, and I’d really appreciate your perspective.

But I also want to acknowledge the other side of her. She is extremely supportive, and I know she cares for me deeply. She is incredibly loyal, doesn’t drink or smoke, and is sweet when she’s happy. When things are good, we really get along, and she always expresses how much she loves me. She wants us to succeed together and build a future, but only if I give her my everything—if I am fully committed and available to her 24/7. She wants to feel like I’m hers entirely, and that can sometimes feel overwhelming. I know she means well, but it feels like I’m losing myself in the process. 

Should I take the step back and focus on myself, or am I making a huge mistake? I am scared to death I might regret it and miss her deeply. I’m torn, and I’d really appreciate your perspective.

1ilxd1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ilxd1l/aita_for_leaving_my_date_for_being_black/,AITA for leaving my date for being black?,"I met my date on tinder about four months ago. Her profile picture showed her blue eyes, straight blond hair, and fair skin with freckles. We had been texting ever since we matched, and I had asked several times to meet in person. At first she simply expressed concern about not knowing each other well enough, but eventually turned into plain excuses. She always had a reason not to or a prior obligation she couldn’t get out of. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and figured she was just cautious. Eventually, I persuaded her to meet, and we made plans for a coffee date. On the day of the date, I arrived twenty minutes early, eager to met the girl I had been getting to know for months. Several other people filled the coffee shop over the next little while. I waited for nearly an hour, and after she was over thirty minutes late, I began to think she had stood me up.   


As I was about to leave, a girl got up from her booth not too far from mine and approached me. She introduced herself as the same name as my date, to which I responded by saying how coincidental that was, I was meeting a girl with the same name. She then proceeded to tell me she was that girl, to which I laughed. This girl was obviously a black lady, with dark skin and dark curly hair, completely different than the picture I had seen.  She got mad when I laughed, then pulled out her phone to show me all of our messages over the last four months. I stared, visibly confused. She went on to explain that guys she had dated in the past turned out to be racist and treat her poorly, so she used a picture of one of her friends as her profile picture to get a “better guy” in her words. She figured that since I turned out to be a good person when she got to know me, she could finally reveal her true self and I would love her as she was and treat her better than other guys. 



It took me a second to absorb the information I just learned, but once I gathered my composure I told her that what she did was manipulative and deceitful, and that I did not want to be with someone who thought dishonesty at such an extreme level was an acceptable thing to do. I told her I was done with her right there and turned to walk out. As I did, she burst into tears and loudly began exclaiming how she was wrong about me, I was just like the rest of the racist trash she had dated before. She yelled how dare I break up with her just because she was black, I clearly showed my true colors and proved she was right to hide her looks in the first place, to avoid people like me. She drew a lot of attention with her yelling, and at the race comment, people turned to gape and glare at me. I simply continued walking out to my car, I didn’t want to listen to any more of what she had to say. Am I wrong for leaving her over this matter?",0,1739160032.0,AmItheAsshole,17,0.19,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

He has always had a problem with taking it very personally that she doesn’t trust him or come to him easily.  

He screamed at my cat at the top of his lungs, using the f word over and over, and calling her bad names.  He chased her under his bed.  He said he almost punched a hole in the wall and dresser.  He put his head under the bed and screamed at her when she was hiding and scared.  

He already did this before and my mom said he can never do it again but he forgot.  The way he told us about it was so casual and like it wasn’t wrong.  But he demonstrated the yelling and it made my ears ring so hard and hurt for a longtime.  It was extremely loud and scary.  

My cat is a baby, she’s less than a year old.  She’s extremely sweet and affectionate, I’ve never loved an animal as much as her.  When he told me this stuff I was so terrified I was shaking and ended up throwing up.  I am scared he will kill my cat.  She does worse things than spill coffee.  Not on purpose.

It wasn’t what I wanted, but I was grateful nonetheless. 
The second thing he gave me was also around the same time, maybe towards the end of our first year he had went to a store with his mom to go get clothes and I jokingly told him to not forget about me this time and get me something nice. I wasn’t expecting anything but he came home with a cute sweatshirt. Wasn’t my type, it was more his mom’s style but it was cute and I was grateful. But over the almost 5 years we’ve been together, he’s never given me birthday gift, valentines gift/date, Christmas or anything. He doesn’t ever want to enjoy my hobbies with me but if I don’t indulge in his video game hobbies it’s a problem and I’m making him feel lonely. 
A month ago we got into an argument. What caused it was his mom. We were going out to eat together and his mom decided last minute (as usual) to tell him something super important that she could’ve handled days prior but decided that exact moment was when he had to do it. I was genuinely upset because it was to one of my favorite sushi restaurants that we hardly go to since it’s so expensive and (I may have overreacted) but I told him, “as usual, your mom decides to ruin plans again last minute.” And he kinda tilted his head and got upset asking what I meant by it and I basically told him that, “Every time we decide to do something special it gets ruined by your mom and her last minute issues. We couldn’t celebrate my birthday like planned because you wanted to wait on your mom’s response on going to the aquarium LAST MINUTE and even when she didn’t give you a response you decided to just play your video games than going through with celebrating my birthday.” (His mom and I share same bday and I also asked them both if they had any plans months prior to my bday) And we got into it from that and I basically told him that I’m sick of seeing other couples enjoying things together, being gifted things and just feeling loved while I’m over here just feeling unwanted. I’ve never even been given flowers and he told me that what I want is just materialistic. Since then I just haven’t felt the same. Am I overreacting? ",1,1739159633.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I am currently 28 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. Her name is Charlotte, but we like to call her Charlie :) and we are beyond excited to meet her!

I would really appreciate some advice for my work situation. So, I don't want to stop working until I am 36 weeks along mainly because I just despise sitting at home with nothing to do. That being said, I only work 2-3, 8 hour shifts a week because I am also completing some online courses.

My issue is that I want to keep working, but my body aches terribly at work because I am on my feet the entire time and constantly moving. I already have an extra 10 minute break allowed on top of the 30 we all receive. The issue is: I work at a really tiny coffee shop with a very small staff but we are also very popular so we are busy all the time. I already feel bad for taking an extra 10 minutes on my break. At this job, every person on shift is an absolute necessity and if one person is missing, all my coworkers get fucked and the customers get grumpy. I already have really supportive shoes and wear a maternity support belt, but just 2 hours into my shift I am already experiencing pulsating lower back pain and bending down to reach something low is sooo painful on my knees! It is also really fast paced at times and I will regularly experience a strong wave of dizziness if I move too fast. Also having a chair to sit on during this job is simply a no-go.

I would REALLY appreciate if any of you had any ideas that I could share with my doctor and my manager regarding extra work accommodations. It's tough because I already feel like some of my coworkers despise me for not completing certain parts of my job (I can't use the ladder to stock items or put out the heavy furniture).

Also, my boyfriend thinks I should just go on disability at 32 weeks (my doctor would approve of this, he has told me) but like I said, I just really don't like being stuck at home all day :(

Maybe I really should just go on disability early?? Idk, tell me what you think...

**Brains trust, I need your help.**

Last Friday, on the way home from a school event, my 6-year-old looked confused and asked, “Grandma and Grandpa are so nice to you. Why don’t you let them come here?” This was never discussed in front of my two children, so I became wary. I responded, “I’ve never said they can’t come here. Who told you that?” He replied, “Grandma and Grandpa,” then quickly covered his face, apologized, burst into tears, and begged me not to start a fight with them.

When I got home, I was shaking. My son has picked up on the bad vibes within this family system, and now I feel sick and at a complete standstill. After 11 years of dealing with this, it has reached a new level.

**In a nutshell: (I could write a novel here-these are some snippets to give you an idea of the crap that has been going on)**

* I am not what his parents expected in a daughter-in-law. From my upbringing to the fact that my father died when I was a child, everything about me is the opposite of them. We have nothing in common.
* I couldn't even be present to introduce OR DEFEND myself when my husband had to tell them over dinner that he had fallen in love. Rather than be excited for him, they were more concerned with his finances, and said ""make sure she doesn't fleece you."" Instead of asking about me, they were more interested in my ""family values"" because clearly they wanted grandchildren. They were even more disappointed at the time when DH had to tell them I had grown up in an unstable environment.
* Their body language and communication were frosty from the beginning, causing anxiety. They would only ask my husband about himself and ignore me, even when I was at the same table. They were only interested in what I had to say if it was about my husband, and this extended to their interest in our sons.
* Conversation is rarely directed at me unless I’m alone with them, and then they seem anxious. They don’t ask about my life; they only want to hear my husband’s stories or gossip about other family members who made ‘bad choices.’ I know they’re talking about me too.
* My in-laws insist they are close, but initially, all the siblings seemed uncomfortable around their nosy and overbearing parents. Siblings only call my husband if they want something, never to say hello.
* Think of the type of MIL who is ultimately only interested in either her father’s best interests, or her son’s best interests. (Male centered-makes excuses for the men in her life-but interestingly enough lacks an emotional connection with her own spouse because she has spent their entire time identifying as a parent.)

**Wedding Planning:**

* During wedding planning, my MIL insisted on having music because “people will want to dance” and that my BIL should be in the groom’s party because he is family. Guess who wasn’t included in BIL’s groom’s party when he eventually got married?
* Insisted that my Narc Grandparents have an opportunity to make a speech so that GFIL could do the same-denied.

**Motherhood:**

* My journey into motherhood was a mess. My own mother played mind games and ignored me during my son’s first year. My MIL became overbearing and fearful, saying ignorant things like, “You need to get some sunlight, or your child will be autistic.”
* 2 weeks postpartum she’s insisting that I make my husbands sandwiches for work because “it’ll really help him out.” (My husband and her had decided that she would come and help us for two weeks after his paternity leave ran out. Years later when I started to feel normal, I asked him how dare they both not consider my needs and include me in the decision making process rather than taking that autonomy away. He is incredibly embarrassed about this as a result.)
* In my innocence I would try to open up to this woman, only to have her tell me that depression doesn’t exist, or that psychologists are only money hungry, or the best one is that when I try to talk about something that is in her words “so different to anything she’s ever experienced” she asks me how my husband feels about it all, rather than show some care to the person who is letting her in and asking for help

**Brother-in-law’s Wedding:**

* Five years later, my BIL married a woman in the same line of work as my MIL, instantly connecting with her. They liked her because she was more like them. They behaved well at the wedding and gave the bride and groom space, leaving me with a bitter taste. I felt like a guinea pig put through their paces until they became socially palatable.
* MIL constantly talking about new DIL saying how ""great she is"" and that she will ""organise things with new DIL"". Meanwhile I get a text once a year with the obligatory happy birthday.

**Attempts to Address Issues:**

* I’ve asked my husband multiple times to speak to his parents. They accept the boundaries he sets but become even icier with me. He has asked them to take an interest in my life and participated in role plays with them.
* The pattern continues: they either don’t take my husband’s requests seriously, or he is incapable of delivering the information effectively. We end up having less contact, and the dynamic is felt within the extended family. Siblings have little to say to me at family events, and I catch them looking at me coldly. I can no longer tolerate this discomfort.
* I have done my best very early on when I sensed that these people would be hard to please. I resent that I was never good enough to begin with and now am being treated as someone they don't want to acknowledge.

**Next Steps:**

* We were supposed to have a chat with them after BIL’s wedding, but it didn’t happen. I’m tempted to message my MIL directly to discuss the issues over coffee. My husband doesn’t want me to handle it directly because he fears I’ll lose my temper, pushing them away altogether.
* My resolve is that we go to therapy together first, then I will handle this issue. I suspect they don’t understand their actions, and my husband is miscommunicating my needs to soften the blow.\]
* Husband insists that they know of the mistakes they have made and are now feeling so awkward about it, they don't know how to act. I can't continue on with having people who aren't into personal growth and accountability in my life. This is not teaching my children how to handle situations respectfully.

There has been this student who has been flirting  and hitting on me. Calling me stunning, and wanting to bring a coffee for me. im not used to being hit on or flirted with, so i was not sure how to react. and thought they were just being nice. all i could do was laugh and say thank you.

 He catched me during my break time and he made small talk with me. We got into a convo, which was actually a decent and nice convo. halfway, he talked about how he was lonely, he is an immigrant that is in a new country.  i feel for him as even though im not an immigrant, i feel lonely often too as i dont really have many friends or people in my life. he says how i was the first person to have a deep convo with him in his time of the country and complimented me on my looks again and that enjoyed talking to me and to have more confidence within myself. 

the next day He straight up said how he wanted to take me to a museum one day when he stopped to chat a little with me and saw the painting behind me and had convo about the arts, this made me feel awkward and my other coworkers and students can hear it and felt embarrassed. then i just mumbled and  stopped talking altogether . i do make some small talk with students at times and it been nice but this was different. Its hard because i still have to be friendly with everyone.

last day his classes finish,i ask him if he has a form we gave him to fill out, its an evaluation survey sheet.  i tell him that please we need it and  to bring soon as possible. i have been asking for days. he said he would bring it next week and hopes to see me and  always happy to see me and using a lot of flattery on me how my smile lights up his day. ,then asked if i was single/married. That threw me off completely, i kept nervously laughing, i didnt expect this would happen to me (i have low self esteem) and didnt answer, he asked again if i was married and i was frozen for a bit until i let out a nervous and very quiet no.......  in which i should of said yes! my fight or flight had me frozen  and i didnt have time to think it through.

and he seemed very happy that i was not and how he can bring me a coffee when he comes next week and how he will see me next week.  he said that to me in a form of a question. i said yes i will see you next week while smiling too.

I said that  because he has to come to give in form and pick up his certificate next week, now i realize, i  think i caused a big misunderstanding, i was shocked and could just laugh and nervously look away and mumble........ and smile. i was not clear and i think he thinks that i agreed to date him or something, and im very anxious to go to work next week. i have no idea what to do,  im embarrassed too because the whole office can hear what he is saying and im just here panicking thinking of how to stay and remain professional, my other coworkers heard. i eventually did tell some workers of it, they were supportive and understood how i was just a nervous and nice person and then thats how i found out,

he also flirted with my coworker and used the same lines with her. When she said she was in a relationship, he stopped speaking and greeting her and ignored her. Which i didnt find nice, since she was nice to him and even offered for him to contact her if he needs help with adjusting to this country as she is an immigrant too and he just pretended she didnt exist after that. so the previous positive thoughts i had about him and giving benefit of the doubt flew out the window after that.

If  in case i do see this person, i was wondering what could i say to sound professional and clear misunderstandings if he does come and mention anything? maybe nothing will happen but my anxious brain is ruminating. my coworker said to say that im not straight to him lol and honestly thinking of saying that. im scared of hurting people feelings and disappointing them but i need to stick with my boundaries",3,1739159062.0,hsp,0,1.0,False

Glass buildings sparkled under the fading sunlight, casting long shadows over the streets that once thrummed with life.  Yet, something was profoundly wrong.

People wandered the sidewalks, their faces painted with expressions of vacant horror. They moved as if in a trance, eyes glazed over, whispers of laughter turned into hollow echoes of despair.  The sounds of the city—the honks of cars, the chatter of friends—were muted, replaced by an oppressive silence that hung in the air like a thick fog.  It was a world that looked normal at first glance, but upon closer inspection, the signs of decay were inescapable.

Around the parks, families sat together, yet there was no joy in their gatherings. Children played, their laughter a haunting melody that masked the tension in the air.  Adults clutched their phones, scrolling through endless feeds filled with news of the strange phenomena gripping the nation. Reports of unexplainable suicides surged, and amidst it all, the term “the smile” began to circulate—a vague reference to a creeping horror that left victims unable to escape their own minds.

The symptoms were insidious: people were becoming unmoored, unravelling from the inside out. The unsettling smiles plastered on faces were no longer indicators of happiness; instead, they heralded despair.  It was as if an unseen force was siphoning their very will to live, infecting them with dread and paranoia.  Those who spoke of their experiences described the sensation of being watched, followed by something far worse than death itself—a slow descent into madness.

The streets were littered with remnants of normalcy—coffee shops bustling with patrons who barely exchanged glances, parks filled with people pretending to enjoy the sun.  Yet, the pervasive air of desperation was suffocating. Those who dared to speak of it called it a “curse,” an unseen terror that wrapped itself around the soul, infecting minds one by one.  The light was fading, and so was hope.

In stark contrast to this grim reality, a different kind of despair played out in a sterile room shrouded in shadow.  Here, the air was thick with an antiseptic smell that clung to the walls, reflecting the clinical nature of the space. The dim lighting flickered overhead, revealing a series of security cameras mounted in the corners, their lenses glinting like watchful eyes. Metal instruments lay neatly arranged on a nearby table, their surfaces gleaming coldly, a testament to the meticulous organization of this hidden facility.

An array of monitors flickered silently along one wall, displaying streams of data and surveillance feeds from across the country, their screens bathed in a soft green hue that cast an unsettling glow. Each feed showcased scenes of everyday life, now tinged with an eerie sense of unease as the world outside continued to spiral into chaos.

Beyond the heavy steel door, muffled voices echoed in the corridor, their tones grave and urgent. The faint sound of boots marching in sync resonated through the walls, hinting at the presence of personnel trained for high-stakes operations. A nearby desk bore the insignia of an agency that specialized in covert matters, its surface cluttered with files stamped “Top Secret” and redacted documents that hinted at the gravity of the situation unfolding beyond these walls.

A man lay strapped to a table, his breaths shallow and ragged.  On the far wall, a television flickered to life, casting an eerie glow over the scene.  The announcer's voice pierced through the haze, a mix of urgency and despair.  “The death of global pop star Skye Riley has sent shockwaves through the nation. Authorities are now investigating the circumstances surrounding her tragic suicide, which many are calling the catalyst for what has now been dubbed a ‘Smiledemic.'”

Images of Skye filled the screen, her radiant smile frozen in time, juxtaposed with reports of chaos erupting across cities.  The announcer continued, “Experts warn that the phenomenon, characterized by an alarming rise in suicides linked to the so-called ‘smiling plague,’ is spreading rapidly.  Communities nationwide are being urged to remain vigilant, as millions exhibit signs of withdrawal and despair.”

As the broadcast continued, snippets of interviews with friends and loved ones echoed through the room, their voices tinged with heartbreak and confusion. “He was so vibrant, so full of life,” one friend lamented, tears streaming down her face. “I can’t believe he’s gone. It’s like we’re all being haunted by something we can’t see.” 

News channels flashed images of familiar faces, everyday people who had fallen victim to this nameless horror. Stories of suicides flooded the media, each case more inexplicable and terrifying than the last. They all followed the same unsettling pattern: after witnessing a violent suicide, a spiral of quiet despair that escalated until it exploded in a final, grotesque smile and their own horrific death. Family members and friends described their loved ones as “possessed,” as though something alien had invaded their minds, forcing them to relive their worst fears and most shameful regrets.

The camera panned to scenes of empty streets and desperate faces, shadows of a once-thriving society slowly succumbing to an insidious force. “Authorities are calling for immediate intervention,” the announcer urged, “as experts scramble to understand the psychological impact of this mysterious affliction.”  With that, the room fell into a haunting silence, the flickering television casting dancing shadows on the walls, as the man closed his eyes against the chaos that threatened to engulf him.

Cold metal pressed against his skin, and the dim light overhead flickered, casting an eerie glow across his features. The murmur of voices surrounded him, fragments of conversation slipping in and out of focus. He could feel the weight of their gazes, but the words were muddled, barely decipherable.

“...He’s the only one...can save us...” a voice echoed, tinged with urgency.

“...but how can he know?  He...”

“...He possesses the…unique ability...it’s our only chance...”

The murmurs swirled around him like a tempest, disorienting and surreal. He fought to open his eyes, to anchor himself to something solid, but the words slipped through his mind like sand.  None of it made sense.

A sharp intake of breath punctuated the chatter, and a woman stepped closer, her features partially obscured by shadow. “Find Mark Grodsky when you wake up,” she instructed, her tone commanding yet edged with a subtle fear.

With that, the air in the room shifted, and he felt an unfamiliar pulse of energy surge through him—a connection to something vast and unfathomable.  It was a whisper of possibility, a flicker of hope in a world on the brink of collapse.

But as his consciousness began to fracture, all he could grasp were the remnants of the nightmare that had been haunting him—images of a smiling face, a girl who had vanished into darkness, and a world unraveling at the seams.

And then, everything faded to black.",1,1739158436.0,SmileMovie,0,1.0,False

We talked for a for a day or two and then I asked her out to coffee, to which she agreed. We met Thursday and the general vibe was that it went well. She mentioned that she was playing in a spikeball tournament (she’s on our uni’s club team) this weekend and that I should stop by. She also said right as we were both leaving the coffee date that “we should do this again” and gave me a hug.

This is where things started getting weird. Before the coffee date, she was pretty chatty with me. In fact, I originally was gonna wait to talk to her until the date but she reached out to me a few days before and started a convo with me. But since the date, she been less chatty and hasn’t been replying to my texts like she was before, which I get to an extend if Im just talking about school or whatever but I asked her yesterday if she had any plans for after her tournament today and she never responded. I ended up still going to her tournament today to see her. When I got there she greeted me with a hug and sounded happy to see me. (The way she had described it to me made it sound like it was some kind of big tournament with other schools, but it ended up being just like an unofficial inter-club tournament, which isn’t really important expect for the fact that Im fairly confident that I was the only person that wasn’t affiliated with the club that was there watching.) She even introduced me to a few of her friends in the club.

I stayed for about an hour or so and then left when they all breaked for lunch. Before I left I asked if she wanted to do dinner sometime, to which she said we could do it Tuesday or Thursday. As we were both left, she gave me and hug and waved at me after I got into my car and while she was getting into her friend’s car. A couple hours after I left, I texted her seeing when she would be free for dinner, and she still hasn’t responded.

This is the farthest I have ever made it with a girl, so in all honestly I don’t know how these things are usually supposed to go, but her just not responding to questions like that seems like a red flag to me. Idk though (that’s why I figured I would ask Reddit lol). I think where I am at right now is that if she doesn’t responded to me by the end of the day tomorrow, then Im just gonna cut my losses and move on. But please let me know if I am jumping to conclusions too soon and if you have any insight into my situation please share.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

First game Lucanis - so our handsome assassin stole my heart primarily with that deep sexy voice and killer accent. So that was a big pro that beautiful voice. Loved flirting with him however he never seemed to react much. To be honest I almost went with Emmerich who is so delightfully flustered when you flirt with him. Until the scene. You know the scene Spite and Taash in his room and then Lucanis wakes up. Now the flirting in that scene is fire. Lucanis goes from 0 to smolder in 1 second and I was there. And then the worst snub in video game history when he almost kisses you but didn't. How I shouted at my screen. But I persevered.  I do think the romance would have been better if there had been even one more scene with him. I thought for sure after he was first talon and he wanted to come home. Instead he sits and drinks coffee and didn't even ask you to sit with him. Honestly by the end of the run I had almost forgotten we were a thing. (TBF a lot was happening).  Then the final scene with him was chef's kiss. I mean if there had been one more scene with him or some acknowledgement that you're in a relationship but honestly you're basically pinning it all on the ending. Now I do have head canon for after the game but still I think the devs shortchanged him. 
Now Emmrich brings the romance. Adorably flustered when you flirt. Then there are so many scenes with him. The scene with the skull - love it because it's him really being vulnerable. He knows very well how necromancy is viewed outside Nevarra and still he opens up about talking to the dead. Then he takes you to meet the parents (obviously) and if you start the romance there is the beautiful romantic gesture and hot kissing. Then what is there to do but take you on a proper wine and dine date. Complete with more conversation and yes kisses.  He's the only companion to worry about you and the stress you're under as well. Also he always calls you darling after you start a romance with him. His final scene in the necropolis is also very Emmrich. One he came because he was worried Solas had put a curse on you and he was going to take care of that and two he's surprised when you initiate but very receptive. Then there is the coffin scene. Plus only Emmrich would be a morning person - who is also more than happy to go for round 2. 
The killer part is this time around I watched Neve and Lucanis get together and he's a much better boyfriend to her than he is to you. Ladies and gentlemen the winner of the best romance (so far) is Emmrich in a landslide. ",4,1739158076.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,2,0.75,False

When I was in high school, I have this classmate whom I always saw as a friend. We like the same bands, same jokes and tricks. I never thought na you had feelings for me then seeing that I wasn't even aware of what feelings are because of our age. Fast forward to senior high school, though we were studying at different schools, I have developed feelings for you (for whatever reason, that's not something I can answer lol). And then college hit. You're getting invites from people studyin at my school and it was just perfect that you told me we had feelings for each other at different times. We went out one night, we walked around the bay and even sat by the beach. The night was perfect to end with a kiss, so I thought. But there were chinese men walking behind us and taking pictures. You cursed at them silently as I know you were having the same thoughts as mine. 

Up to this day, I still wonder what could've happened if we had that kiss to end the night. I still wonder what could've happened if I had the guts to tell you how I felt when the feelings were strong. 

Now, we're both far from each other. I can say I am happy 95% because the 5% is still hanging on to the ""what if"" that is you. We may have talked about this a few months ago but I wish you knew that I forgot our agreement. I forgot that we made a deal to be with each other by a certain age. That's what breaks me everytime I remember you. I forgot that I made that promise to meet you when we're ending our 20's. And since everything's done, I hope you find your other half. I hope you tell her how you feel at the right timing. I hope I've made you happy for that one night by the beach. I miss you and your energy. Please live as long as you may. I would like to have coffee with you when we're old and grey, talking about what great things have happened just because I forgot our agreement. :)

1ilwqcd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilwqcd,"Need something to hold detachable ""rabbit ears"" rods upright","Via eBay, I recently bought a mid-1990s Magnavox SmartWave antenna (MANT100), which uses 300-ohm twin-lead connectors, like most of 20th-century antennae back in the days. Originally, it was for my parents' Sony smart TV, but then I realized that a fine tuning knob would be needed for one or more low-power UHF channels. Any other antenna without the knob would produce almost same results.

Right now, I'm connecting the Magnavox antenna to a VHF/UHF combining transformer, which is connected to a Roku TV.

To properly receive (sub)channels using channel 8, I have to detach the detachable VHF ""rabbit ears"" portion from the main antenna (or the UHF portion). Then I have to make holes for two empty paper coffee cups to hold the rabbit ears. As I noticed, the channel 8 would run better if I separate the rods from the main/UHF antenna.

For better reception, I'm using two boxes to elevate the antenna's standing.

I'm uncertain about how long the coffee cups will hold the rods and how sturdy the cups are. I tried searching online for sturdy stands holding the rods without avail.",3,1739157943.0,ota,1,1.0,False

They are both attending the same university as me right now. On Friday morning we were on campus together and I was still feeling sleepy so my best friend(20f) gave me her coffee cup, saying she’s drank most of it already and I can finish it off.

My sister teased us, calling it an ‘indirect kiss.’ Jenna glared at me and I asked her what’s wrong. She said it’s ’not hygienic’ which is understandable. Both of her parents are doctors so she’s very careful with hygiene and stuff.

My best friend also once told me I’d be beautiful as a girl which Jenna was unhappy about. She said it’s weird to say that about a guy, which is fair enough, I suppose.

But my sister insists that Jenna is jealous and said I ask her out again. I told her I’m not gonna ask someone out after they rejected me so she told me I should flirt with my best friend in front of her to make her jealous and goad her into asking me out. I don’t know want to do that though; it would be using someone as a means to an end.

So I told my sister we won’t be discussing this again. She’s upset, saying that she’s only trying to help and that I should be appreciative instead of dismissive.

After a prediabetic diagnosis from my doctor almost a decade ago, I began working with a trainer who starved me and had me doing 2 hours in the gym. It was a super low carb diet mixed with heavy weightlifting. It wasn’t sustainable. Since then, I have kept off most of the weight I lost a few years ago, but entered into a healthy relationship where I put on some happy pounds. Even while watching my diet and exercising every day, I’m no longer seeing any loss. Now that we’re going to be getting married, I wanted to get back into better shape but in a healthier way. 

I got it approved for my weight and previous prediabetes diagnosis and I’m thankful that insurance is covering it except for a $25 copay. I’m absolutely nervous about potential side effects, but more excited for this journey and to see how it’s going to help me get healthier inside and out. ",6,1739157347.0,Zepbound,4,1.0,False

Please take my advice depende sa trip nyo and it might or might not work for you. Just sharing my experience and what I did. . 



For context:	

1.  I’m a retaker and took my first exam last 2017 and my second take was last December 2024.
2. I’m a mother with two toddlers.
3. I’m working full time, like more than 40 hours or more per week. 
4. I’m a full time online reviewee.
5. Mahilig ako sa anime, movies and kdrama. They are my guilty pleasures. 



I work 8 hours per day most days of the week since hindi fix ang off ko. I work from home so I have 2 monitors. My line of work is customer service, calls come in and I assist them. My study routine is mostly during working hours. I started reviewing around May and I followed the 3-month study schedule of Pinnacle. Pagnonood ako Naka 1.5 to 1.75 speed ako kaya siguro I finished the coverage early. What I did for most of the subjects is nung una one subject per day akong kung anong video ang assigned doon tinatapos ko talaga sya for that day. If there are like 2 videos on a topic mostly natatapos ko sya during my whole shift on average, kasi mostly around an hour per video lang naman sa Pinnacle other than RFBT. Sa work ko may times na kyuwing and may times din na hnd so kahit paano na didistribute ko yung video all throughout my shift. After ng shift ko sa work I mostly sleep or mag kakape sa mall. I resume practicing that topic of the day around after ko mag recharge. If hindi ako makapag aral ng maayos since I have toddlers in the house tumatambay ako sa studyhub na closer sa amin after shift. Pag nasa study hub minimum of 4 hours ako tambay doon. I’m not sure if dahil sa edad but I’m getting slow in understanding and madali akong makalimot so paulit ulit ako. What I did is after natapos ko ang first pre board coverage.



Review Tip 1. Index Cards - I repeated the coverage once again to summarize. I got a ¼ index card per topic, bahala ano kadami ang need e summarize pinag kakasya ko sya sa one piece na index card so paliitan ng hand writing. I do this para ma if may nakakalimutan ako along the way isang bunot lang ng index card and part na din sya ng active recall ko and madali ko syang ma alala if nakikita ko sya. If you will see my index cards masasabi mong ew ang dumi naman because I bring my index card everywhere like sa CR, sa coffee shop, sa bed or everytime I had a chance to study I bring it. Minsan nga dinadala ko lang sya for the sake na hnd ako ma guilty at ma condition brain ko na I need to study haha. I really dedicated time and priority to this review since this is my 2nd take and i cant afford na mag refresher. I made sure I gave the review all I got since this is the last time I’m taking it plus I’m working so my time is limited. 



Review Tip 2. Unwind - Nakaka burn out ang review promise lalo pa sa working reviewee kasi kadalasan ang set up natin is work, review, work combination. It is not a crime to unwind and indulge in our guilty pleasures once in a while. Importante din ang tulog. If I’m sleepy hnd talaga ko nag aaral kasi sayang lang, quality over quantity. We absorb more if our brain is relaxed.



Review Tip 3. Repetition beats confusion - Kasi it has been like 7 years since I graduated so medyo gone with the winds na ang aking learning. After I study it, nakakalimutan ko talaga ang madaming portion (kaya very helpful for me ang index cards). I have no choice but to repeat to understand and I realized that everytime I repeat a topic I understand it better parang salaan sya, like if ano yung hindi ko na catch sa first aral ko mas nakukuha ko sya after 2-4 times of repetition. I have all the time since I finished the coverage way too early like super early to the point na naka ilang anime ako in betweens. If hindi ko gets paulit ulit lang ako sa same materials to the point I almost memorize the whole Tax Sheet ni Sir Brad. I read all the materials at least 5 times minimum, I watch the videos at least 2-3 times on average. Ito lang ang materials ko so i make use of it to the best of my abilities. Paulit ulit talaga ko, signs of aging na din siguro to hehe



Review Tip 4. Feel the good energy around you - Very impactful ang positive energy keep it flowing. It opens the mind and relaxes your nerves. Wag ka muna makipag away sa kahit kanino bawi ka na lng away ulit after the boards hehe. Mag simba ka, just going to the church may something na nakaka boost ng morale ko. Hindi ako masyadong nag dwe dwell sa social media kasi may ingetera side ako (sori na) and ayaw ko yun ang umiral during review kasi it affects me negatively. I actually created a dummy account para doon lang ako tatambay if needed. One of the reason I took the boards is yung classmate ko na nangongopya lang before is naging CPA na so naingit ako haha feel ko nakaya nya so syempre kaya ko din yun (panget naman ng ugali ko lol wag tularan please). 



Review Tip 5. Confidence is the Key - alam ko so mahangin but when I reviewed this 2024 I notified people around me that I’ll passed the exam whether they like it or I like it. I always claim that I’ll passed and I did. Condition your mind that you are meant to passed and formalities na lang ang exam. I was super delusional in passing to the point that even if my body surrenders and tinatamad na ko or pagod na my mind keeps pushing me to study. Honestly, there is a point na my safe haven is studying, I felt comfort in studying because of this delusional mindset kaya siguro mabilis ko matapos ang coverage and kahit ilang ulit kong ni repeat I still have the same enthusiasm in reading and learning. When I entered the room during the exam inisip ko na akong pinaka genius sa room na ito (sooo cringe). One of the proctors said to me after I pass my sheet parang nadalian ka ata sa exam a, I’m not sure what type of aura I emit for her to say that since hindi ako nag so sound sa loob ng room kasi bawal naman makipag usap and wala din akong kausap. Weird.  Maging mayabang ka, let yourself believe na kaya mo and matalino ka and ikaw pinaka genius sa universe, I cant stress it enough na since it really had help me tremendously. Mind conditioning is power.  Maging mahiyain ka na lang ulit after the boards pwede ka na maging old self mo again. To be honest I check yung list ng mga kasama ko sa room, there were like 3 of us in that room who passed. 



Review tip 6. Recall, Practice, Focus and Repeat. - We are humans, we can only retain a handful of information at a time so muscle memory is also a game changer. Madami times na confused ako sa question sa boards but because of muscle memory I just suddenly got an answer. For working reviewee who has limited Focus sa basic na what and why. 

Wag ka na masyado mag dwell mag aral sa mga mind boogling practice questions. (you could if you want to of course). Focus din sa review materials mo because they are your road map. Quality over quantity is another mantra of mine. Focus ka lang sa goal mo always. If you have limited time, please maximize every chance you get to study. Always have time for active studying yung focus ka talaga. 



* I hope some of this will help you. This is just from my experience and what I did, at the end of the day it still boils down to you and how you prepare. Good luck CPA Aspirants, you can definitely do it. ",8,1739156933.0,AccountingPH,1,1.0,False

I've never met her in person. It's an internet stalker/crush/obsession/limerence situation.

Everything started in mid 2022. I was lurking on a FB page to find new rental and saw this girls post, was looking for a rental. Had a look her profile. Pretty tidy girl-next-door, mid 20's from bush, new to big city. Local model mid 4 figure followers, made her move to big city post COVID, she's also PT and Pilates instructor. Quite fit, tall, masculine-ish body. She's not top looking, I'd say 7 plain, 8 with make-up but she was looking very sincere on her photos. I had fantasised her for a moment but I was already dating with a girl at that time so brushed off. Added her on Instagram to check and maybe build a connection for future. I haven't watched any stories, just looked her photos, great family/friend circle, everything looking tidy aside some night-life chasing, her FB is just her modelling dreams and road to it with milestones. 

Then in late 2022, I've started to watch some of her stories, not very aggressively. She's building her friend circle, quite night life involving - night outs with elaborate places with high-value people, doing generic/touristic activities in city (events, concerts, restaurants etc.), generally looking happy. I still have my date fwiw.

In early to mid 2023 I've ended my situation-ship. Started to look/follow/DM bunch of girls on Instagram, online dating etc. Still nothing aggressively towards this girl. Then I don't know something happened, maybe fantasised too much, maybe looked at her photos too much, something started to grow in me by mid 2023. I'm usually very strong character when it comes to these things. Then I saw some of her stories, going dates with some people in interstate, night-life going full on still but I really don't have a clue about her life completely as I'm resisting to watch her stories. BTW, SHE ALWAYS HAS MULTIPLE STORIES 7/24, NO BREAK, LIKE A BIG BROTHER.

By August 2023. after seeing her stories with some dude multiple times with night-outs, day dates I've thought she made a BF and completely brushed her off my head. Never checked her stories or had a look on her profile. Still fantasising somehow and then again ""that something"" came into my mind - had a look her profile by December 2023. She deleted all her photos from start. All her candid, family, friend circle photos gone. She only posted her professional shots day by day from September 2023, with a first post saying ""rebranding"". She had around 20 professional shots when I've checked on December. I was in shock - why someone would do that? All the good things/green flags were gone. At that time I've started to watch her stories aggressively as this move attract quite interest from me. She was partying hard, caviar bumps with Dom's, fly-out's/travels frequently in interstate, dining at best restaurants, staying at best hotels etc.. In the meantime her Instagram profile was always getting updates in advance on her interstate trips, what days, where she'll be. She's also getting some modelling work but nothing huge. Small, local campaigns and mostly time for prints. I didn't connected the dots at that time. She started to fly-in/out to other big city very frequently, even for 24 hrs.

In the meantime she completely rebranded her Instagram. Added all her old professional shots and very rare, very airbrushed candid photos. There's not a single photo with a friend or family member, not a single photo of hobbies, activities etc.

Something happened early 2024 and there wasn't much activities with her friends. In fact, she started to lost them. I've found a common contact from one of the friends she parted ways but she was hesitant to say anything. She just said ""we lost contact"" I thought girly issues got in the way. I've lost an interest into her as she was giving quite red flags. I stopped watching stories aggressively. I've also found another common male friend of her that she discarded from her life and he only said ""she has problems that no one knows, I think she's inherently good girl""

By end of early 2024 she completely moved to other big city. Posting just daily stuff, hot-girl-walks, Pilates etc. on her stories. I just watch her stories if I bump as she moved out from my city. She's also announced her summer Euro trip on Instagram by April. That time I've stopped watching her stories. 

Her first photo in Europe popped-up in my feed. Monaco GP in a suite at Hotel de Paris Monte Carlo. Then the rest, 150ft yacht in South of France, Golf tour in Swiss Alps, shots in Como, etc all happening in 6 weeks. Then a month in Berlin, a month in London. There's no one in her photos still, just her! In the meantime she's just reheating her very old, I mean 7-8 year old professional shots in between holiday photos. I haven't watched any stories fwiw since she moved to another big city. I still don't connect the dots btw. I have some clues as one old man liking all of her posts since she rebranded late 2023 but I'm just thinking he's someone she randomly met, he's creeping.

I've started to date with a new girl casually but she's still in my mind obviously.

After 4 month elaborate Euro summer, she's back to other big city for good. I still haven't watch a single story since May 2024. She started to post very body revealing photo carousels since she's back to country with showing her high-life, dinners, jewellery, designer stuff etc.. Still squeezing her old professional photos in between as she put quite weight in last 2 years, not getting campaigns, jawline going fast, double chin growing, belly is double story on her candid shots. We all know how girls tucking in that belly. Lol! She's lost all her beauty in just over a year sadly. She started to post very unusual reels, promoting 3rd grade start-up's, posting photos from her Euro trip still as she has nothing to post in her life, it's because nothing happening apparently. All in new posts still no friend, only one girl in 25-30 posts as she has no friend.

Anyway, somehow by late 2024 I've started to connect the dots. That level modelling pays nothing, PT/Pilates just enough to survive - how does this lifestyle getting sustained? Started to watch stories again by December. Nothing happening in her life, nothing interesting, beach/coffee/some scenery/posting her feed posts to promote etc. She's not posting any story past 5pm, Then that old man get into the concept. Yeah! she's sleeping with a 65 year old, 5'5, fat, UHNW to fund her lifestyle since she rebranded. She also entertained another old UHNW in new years, as found out from her new followers and the penthouse the photo taken. By Christmas she unfollowed most of her ex-big city friends, she has no one left in her circle, her engagement rate on her posts around 1% which is pretty low for a personal account sub 10k followers.

I've found another common friend that she discarded in her life by Christmas as she just said ""I wasn't close, didn't lost anything, I don't know what's going on"" Later found out this girl is Insta friend with our Sugar Daddy, likely she's introduced her to him.

Since 1st January she's literally posting photos nearly every day for attention. Some old shots, some new crappy time for prints, some crappy GRWM reels etc. Stories again nothing happening interesting, mid Jan, I've realised she lost her only friends best friend - male. 

Mid Jan, she came back to our city firs time since she left for an important sporting event for a weekend. Business class, suite at Ritz, dinners at newest/hottest/fanciest places, top seat at the event, LV bag, Gucci shoes etc. Also our Sugar Daddy was in the city coincidentally. Our daddy has private profile but I've sneaked in with a fake hot girl profile by late 2024. Now all dots connected. Interstate travels, no BF, no people on photos. I'm angry, I'm fuming, that country girl-next-door is rooting a 65 year old man for money, holidays, designer stuff. etc. in search of high-life, model-life.

I got in touch with the her only friends, friend she lost recently. He said, he ended his friendship as she's very into the life of our girl-next door. He had always bad energy from her, she tried to set him up over money issues, he knew what she's been up to, he tried to warn her friend to stay out of her, she's doing high amount of cocaine, she's sleeping with other older man for cash and cocaine, our Sugar Daddy paying for her life as a main sponsor, she's sleeping with people at her age for cocaine and validation, she has no friends, she's on meds, she's not working since her Euro trip, she has no life etc.. He literally dumped everything and I've dumped to him everything I know and figured out via connecting dots. He slide out from their life as his friend didn't wanted to listen him so he gave up. I'm very angry and very upset as everything made so much sense since late 2023. I'm upset another country girl lost in the big city.

I got in touch with all her friends that she got rid off from her life to give the updates. I got in touch whoever I know in city's high-circle to expose her. I've been from first hand she entertained many people in parties for cash and drugs when she was in my city 2023/early 2024. I still can't accept the facts. I also got in touch her modelling agency as she's posted really nasty stuff that she advertises her coke habit on her stories many times. Since then she posted more weird posts with hidden messages. Her agency obviously warned her. After reaching out everyone in the city, somehow she's heard obviously and I got blocked. Lol!

I got in touch with her sister that without revealing anything I just asked are they ever thinking how she's funding her life style and asked 15 questions in a row that 5 grade student would understand what she's been up to. Not full reveal to her family or her father as her father has her name on his chest as a tattoo but I'm pretty sure things have been boiling as she's not posted any photo in last 3 days or stories in last 2 days.

I don't regret my actions. I don't love her, I have a habit of stalking her. I feel nothing but just emptiness. I don't know even what to do now, how to get rid of this habit as everything out of closet, she's in shit, I'm in habit. I need to move on to my life, devote more time into my dates but involving this much into someone you've never met in your life is also quite draining. I just wanted her to get back on her feet, live a ""normal"" life. Yeah I know I'm a sociopath I guess.....

Could use guidance from fellow T2D doing both","I'm writing you all here to see if anyone else has had this experience... and ask for help in how you might address this. I have a follow up appointment with my doctor next week, and I need to figure something out. I also posted this to the Mounjaro subreddit, but a lot of folks don't get Keto like this community does, so I'd like your perspective if you're willing to offer it up. 

&nbsp;

Background/context: I have been on Mounjaro successfully for well over a year. I've titrated all the way up to 15mg, and was on that dose for over 9 months. My starting weight was around 340, and I lost down to 230. However, around August, my weight loss basically stopped. I gained/lost the same 3-4 lbs for almost 5 months. Then in December, I was hospitalized with a bowel obstruction. That sucked. The proximate cause of that obstruction was a blocked bile duct caused by a gallstone. No surgery, but needed a bit of intervention to clear it up. In my opinion...it happened because I believe I wasn't hydrating nearly well enough. I was drinking way too many coffees, and not enough water. I then had a follow up appointment with my doctor who basically stated ""We should take you off Mounjaro"". I pushed back, advising that I have enjoyed better glucose control (I am a T2D), and would like to stay on the drug, as I have read that coming off can cause weight gain, and that I still have 50ish lbs to lose.

&nbsp;

He stated he wanted to move me down in dose, to 7.5mg. I asked if we could try 10 at least, and he agreed.

For 4 weeks now, I have been on 10mg after being on 15mg for months. I have regained 12 lbs. I am drinking more water, and have changed no other habits, eating the same level of calories/etc, usually around 1500 a day max.

 &nbsp;

Some additional context: For months nowI feel absolutely, overly full no matter what I eat. Small portion or not, and I feel stuffed.. often. It always feels like I am catching up in digestion, if that makes sense. That has not gotten better, although I do not appear to be digesting so slow to cause the gastrointestinal issue I had before. I also suspect a few things in the diet arent great, such as a quest bar or ""hot and spicy pork rinds"" from the grocery store. I keep electrolytes well in tune (I use LMNT packets) but probably need to hydrate even more than I am (avg 100-120oz a day now). Constipation isn't an issue at this point in time (5-10 bm's weekly, usually loose, sorry for tmi). 

**Medications**

* 20mg Etizimbie
* 20mg Lisinopril
* 10mg Mounjaro
* 3 Psylliym Husk Tablets daily
* CVS Probiotic
* Mild workout regiment (Could do better here)

***TLDR:*** Doc moved me from 15-10mg after a hospitalization for bowel obstruction. Ive regained 12 lbs over 4 months, feel full most of the time (same as on 15mg) and haven't changed anything dietarily from when I was on 15mg.

I am asking for your help on what I should do to

1. Get the weight loss back on track
1. How to best advocate for what I need dosage wise? Should I push to go back to 15? Okay to jump straight back to it?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

For context: I'm in my early 20s, I graduated from college in 2023 and have been working a remote job ever since. As I've been working and saving money, I'm grateful that I'm still able to live at my parents' home, the home I've lived in my entire life, with my two older brothers while I'm working my way up to be able to afford living on my own.

It snowed a bit recently where I live and this morning, my dad asked me if I could shovel the rest of the snow him and our mom shoveled hours before. I said sure but because it was right as I woke up, I wasn't going to do it that instant. I wanted to wake up a bit, get some coffee, and maybe get something to eat before I started shoveling. About two hours after waking up, I was just scrolling on my phone for a bit and decided I'd go eat in a couple of minutes before shoveling snow, like my dad asked me to. As I decided to go make myself something to eat, my dad goes into my older brother's room and asks him why he's not shoveling snow like he asked him to do hours ago. My older brother (we'll call him James) said that he had some homework to catch up on (he recently went back to school) with my dad asking him if he needed to get it done immediately. James let out a deep sigh and then said he'd start shoveling a bit later after wrapping up some schoolwork. Immediately afterwards, my dad comes into my room and straight up demands me to go shoveling. I said in response that I will go in 30 minutes as I haven't eaten yet. After walking away, he returns less than 10 seconds later just screaming at both of us and cursing at us while complaining about how he asked us to shovel two hours ago and we still haven't started. He then mocks James, asking how important his homework was that he couldn't shovel immediately. While continuing to scream and insult us, my dad started saying how if we didn't like the way he talked to us that we should either start paying him rent money or completely move out. I knew I wasn't going to have any time to eat, so I immediately put on some clothes to shovel. As I'm walking out of my room, I tell my dad that I'm going out right now to shovel. However, my dad is STILL yelling and cursing at us (English isn't his first language but he basically was calling us ""fuckers"".) and I decided to talk back and told him to please calm down and stop yelling at us because we're going out right now. Even after I asked him to calm down, he is STILL yelling and cursing at me, to which I asked him further to please stop yelling at us because I was going and that the world is not going to end. I assume that last part struck a nerve in him because he responded to that by saying ""This guy sure has a lot to say."" After I called him out on his yelling, he then told me to be quiet which kind of left me speechless because I was perfectly calm the entire time while he was unnecessarily screaming at the top of his lungs. He then proceeded to tell me how he wasn't yelling at me because he was angry (which I don't really understand) and then started insulting me even further, to which I decided to walk away from and just start shoveling.

This isn't the first time he's irrationally threatened to kick us out or start paying rent but it's the last time I'm willing to put up with it. My brothers and I do not have a close relationship with our dad whatsoever because of his physical abuse in the past when we were younger and his uncontrollable temper and rage over nothing most of the time. He also has never apologized for anytime he's treated any of us like this, even to our mom. For clarification, my dad is the breadwinner of the household and I'm still very thankful that he still pays for the mortgage, the food, and the cars that we have. However, I do not ask him for anything else and I pay for everything else on my own--my phone bill, clothes, gas, car maintenance, and everything else I want or need. At this point, I'm just tired of putting up with his irrational fits of rage and I'd much rather pay more money to live on my own than to start paying him rent. I have already started looking into apartments and finding myself a used car to be completely financially free from my dad. As thankful as I am to him for providing for my family, he's only provided for us financially and nothing more. He has never showed any interest in any of his children's lives to the point where he doesn't remember our birthdays and calls us the wrong names from time to time. I think I've put up with my dad's antics for way too long and I've lost all respect I had left in me for him.

Am I overreacting for thinking this way?

1ilvv9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1ilvv9y/for_you/,For you,"I feel awful over what happened and the way that it played out particularly for you. 
It was not and is not something I have been able to let go of and carry with me. 

If I feel this terrible most days, I have to figure that what you went through was my most terrible time amplified and for that, I am filled with dread and the likely realization that I will never hear from you again. 

I do love you. I've missed you and thought about you in ways that have brought great pain and confusion in regards to what would possibly compel me to say such mean things to the love of my life. To the only person who ever knew me. Loved me. Was sweet, kind, and loving to me. Connected with and spent years of our lives together which I truly cherished. 
And in return for all of that, I've let you down. 
I've managed to scare you off and block myself from likely ever hearing your sweet soft voice ever again. 
I'm not able to know or hear how you are doing. I am not able to be anything more in your eyes then this terrible person. I hate that. Because I don't hate you at all. I don't think you're terrible. I look back on things almost daily as they come to me. Time has given me clarity and perspective I wish I had then before I made the biggest mistake of my life.

You're not an enigma to me. I see you for you and love you as you are no matter what. To know and understand that but have operated in a way that showed enormous jealousy and confusion will be the bereavement of my entire life. That I was so foolish and arrogant and a tactician of being mean and saying wicked things that I regret but can't take back. If you weren't on my mind daily, I would have never thought to look on reddit. To read a very similar situation posted across boards. I was only able to speculate that it must have been you but since the person disappeared over nite along with their posts, I will never know. 

I have the feeling that I will never know a lot of things. Starting with the gap of years in our ages. I felt that I could easily relate to you but stupidly, didn't take your advice to calm down and chill out. Those years of life you have on me are wisdom that can only be earned by living on this earth and experiencing life. I should have been grateful and listened. I should have appreciated your presence. It was literally the only thing I had ever hoped for anyway.
To look you in the eyes and be met with that tippie toe kiss I've missed for so long that I attribute to you and only you. 

So if you are reading this... therapy has been stressful for me. The therapist seems to be blaming you and I don't see it that way. I feel awful for what I've done because I know it hurt you, then you wanted to hurt me back the best and most effective way possible which was by cutting off contact and leaving me with silence and nothing else but loneliness to connect myself and my thoughts and to put it all together. 

I do know that you would do anything for someone you loved. Take enormous risks just to be together and I've wondered if you haven't grown addicted to that part. The doing what you shouldn't do but can part. How I'm left to think of what to do about all of this if there is even anything to be done but take it for the loss it is and pray that I don't relapse and return back to the hell of addiction. 
I'm grateful for the clean time that I have, but hardly an accomplishment to someone who doesn't understand addiction. 30 months that I've thought of throwing away each and every day, but by doing that, I would likely lose the last vestige of hope that is attached to my life. Hope that I literally fought for and hope I would be devastated if I just threw away. 

I would think that it would have been easier to just give up. But I'm stubborn in the sense that I don't want to. I want to have a good day. I want to have a sleep without these dreams in which I wake up in full realization and dread as to you being gone and me being the reason why. 

What have i done? I ask myself over and over again. What the fuck have I done? All I ever wanted out of life was to have this meaningful person's presence in my life once again. I felt that if that could have happened, that I had acquired the most important of all I had wished for and could ever wish for. 

What the fuck have i done? 

I miss her. That's for sure.

Thought about writing her directly a lot but went against it because i didn't know what to say. How to word it. How to help her. So I decided against it. 

The only person i ever loved. The only person who had the ability to move me by just looking at me. Had the ability to turn emotions and feelings into tangible real things with a simple kiss. The only person that meant anything to me and i had believed for so long that I could experience once again in my life that connection I so sorely missed and had thought and even dreamt about for years. 

 
I had reached out and she returned to me, I got to see her, I looked forward to hearing her voice first thing in the morning with coffee and ending it by telling eachother goodnight. I loved the idea of video calling which was something I never cared to do with anyone and I had all of these things but still managed to fuck it all up. 

So I just keep pushing forward and when I am able to break away and sit down and write, I will. I'm not going to ever be ashamed of how I feel and it's important to me that this person if out there wherever you are, that you are safe and okay. That I have had you on my mind heavily the past few days and then for the hell of it two nites ago started searching reddit and might have possibly come across you. But can't know for sure. 

What I do know is that you are loved. You are missed. That you will likely never know what loneliness is and for that, I am grateful. I wish for you to heal and love your life as you always have and if a resolution is at all possible, I will surely figure it out and if not, then I will pay the price surely by losing you.

1ilvv6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ilvv6j/did_i_do_something_wrong/,Did I do something wrong?,"So I’m a 33M that has never dated before and I recently joined the apps and matched with a woman 31F on Hinge. We messaged back and forth for about a week and had good conversation about mutual interest so I asked if she’d like to meetup for coffee and she said she’d love to. Our schedules didn’t align well, but eventually we were able to figure out a day and time based on her suggestion, which was a few days out. 

We kept messaging in the meantime and she seemed genuinely excited, but then on the day of the date she cancelled several hours before saying she had a really busy past couple of days and mentally wasn’t up to socializing that night. I said no worries I understand and thanked her for letting me know. Then said to let me know when she’d like to reschedule. She messaged back thanking me for understanding and then suggested connecting on Discord for a call first since we were having trouble with our schedules. I said sure I’d be down for that but mentioned I never used Discord, and added a little joke about it since we had talked a lot about gaming and I thought it might sound a little weird that I game a lot but don’t use Discord. Anyway, I told her I’d go ahead and create an account and then we could figure out when we could have a call. But then after 5 days, she didn’t respond. 

Now we never were super quick to respond but generally both of us would respond within a day or two at most. So it was kinda weird to not hear from her after 5 days. Then I noticed that she had updated her profile some sometime since the last message sent. So I’m really just confused. I sent a quick follow up yesterday morning just asking if she’d still like to have a call but haven’t heard anything back. 

To me it would’ve made more sense that if she wanted to just stop responding she would’ve done it after cancelling the date and not then further suggesting having a call first since our schedules didn’t align. I’m really confused why she would suggest that if she wasn’t interested and wanted to just back out. 

So did I do or say something wrong? Like I said this is my first time trying to date so I’m just confused about it all and trying to learn. ",1,1739155071.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

TLDR: I've averaged making about 20 dollars an hour for the last 30 hours of play. Is it likely that I'm an above average player at this point?

I started playing poker about a year ago. I got insanely lucky the first two times I played somehow winning about 3k in my first two sessions despite actually being an awful player.

From there I proceeded to lose money until I was down about to about negative 8k lifetime.

After that I kind of took a step back and learned how to play the game. I had two main breakthroughs which were learning the basic math and also realizing that I needed to be folding more preflop when other people were raising.

From there I continued to lose for two months but the amount I was losing went down substantially.

Then I had three months where I made a little bit of money (about 300-500) dollars a month. It seems like I've been playing pretty consistently now. I tend to make about 20 dollars an hour playing 1-3 nlh. I still don't think I'm a good player. I just play more conservatively than a lot of people. I still lose a decent amount of money because I'll play for too long and get sloppy.

I'm comfortable being a losing player long term if I only lose 500 dollars a month. At that point it's a hobby and is honestly worth the food and coffee discount.

When will I know that I've gotten to the point where I'm a winning player instead of a losing player?

1ilvuhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/untildawn/comments/1ilvuhi/until_dawn_fan_survey_4/,Until Dawn Fan Survey 4!,"Hey. I used to do fan surveys just as something fun to look at, and they fizzled out when I ran out of worthwhile questions. However, I’m back for a certain reason: I want a more nuanced look at character popularity. Google forms allows ranked voting, which I think might be more informative towards determining an OVERALL fandom attitude towards characters. This might be especially interesting for characters like Mike and Emily who rank high on both favorite and least favorite character lists. Rather than just seeing how each character ranks when the question forces a best or worst (because the ranking doesn’t really indicate how a person feels about each character on average—another example is Matt whom few rank as a favorite but isn’t the overall least favorite either), I want to see a general attitude.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’d love to meet other moms with kids in the 10-13 age range, especially if they’re interested in exchanging letters as well. My 10-year-old son is super curious about writing letters and would love to connect with other kids who share similar interests. He’s really into Japanese culture, anime, video games, and math, so if that sounds like something your kids might enjoy talking about, we’d love to hear from you!

Looking forward to connecting with some wonderful people. Let’s share stories, advice, and just enjoy getting to know each other through the art of letter writing! Feel free to reach out!

I have a follow up appointment with my doctor next week, and I need to figure something out.   


&nbsp;

**Background/context:** I have been on Mounjaro successfully for well over a year. I've titrated all the way up to 15mg, and was on that dose for over 9 months. My starting weight was around 340, and I lost down to 230. However, around August, my weight loss basically stopped. I gained/lost the same 3-4 lbs for almost 5 months. Then in December, I was hospitalized with a bowel obstruction. That sucked. The proximate cause of that obstruction was a blocked bile duct caused by a gallstone. No surgery, but needed a bit of intervention to clear it up. In my opinion...it happened because I believe I wasn't hydrating nearly well enough. I was drinking way too many coffees, and not enough water. I then had a follow up appointment with my doctor who basically stated ""We should take you off Mounjaro"". I pushed back, advising that I have enjoyed better glucose control (I am a T2D), and would like to stay on the drug, as I have read that coming off can cause weight gain, and that I still have 50ish lbs to lose. 

He stated he wanted to move me down in dose, to 7.5mg. I asked if we could try 10 at least, and he agreed. 

For 4 weeks now, I have been on 10mg after being on 15mg for months. ***I have regained 12 lbs.*** I am drinking more water, and have changed no other habits, eating the same level of calories/etc, usually around 1500 a day max. 

&nbsp;

**Some additional context:** For months nowI feel absolutely, overly full no matter what I eat. Small portion or not, and I feel stuffed.. often. It always feels like I am catching up in digestion, if that makes sense. That has not gotten better, although I do not appear to be digesting so slow to cause the gastrointestinal issue I had before. I also suspect a few things in the diet arent great. I eat keto (have for a while), and thinking I need to resimplify my diet. I keep electrolytes well in tune (I use LMNT packets) but probably need to hydrate even more than I am (avg 100-120oz a day now). 

**Medications**

* 20mg Etizimbie
* 20mg Lisinopril
* 10mg Mounjaro
* 3 Psylliym Husk Tablets daily
* CVS Probiotic
* Mild workout regiment (Could do better here)

***TLDR:*** Doc moved me from 15-10mg after a hospitalization for bowel obstruction. Ive regained 12 lbs over 4 months, feel full most of the time (same as on 15mg) and haven't changed anything dietarily from when I was on 15mg. 

I am asking for your help on what I should do to 

1. Get the weight loss back on track
2. How to best advocate for what I need dosage wise? Should I push to go back to 15? Okay to jump straight back to it? 
3. Any other guidance about why I can't seem to lose any more weight?",1,1739154153.0,Mounjaro,14,0.67,False

I started questioning everything around 15-17 about the evangelical church and my sexuality, became rebellious, and didn’t give a shit about what people thought of me I just wanted to be free and unapologetically myself, her on the other hand was more careful of her reputation (that includes what the church thought of her) and got along with majority of authority figures while I had no problem questioning or doubting their “expertise”. At one point I was a devoted Bible thumper and pretended to pray the bi🏳️‍🌈 away….until after I revisited the “what ifs” and “how comes” and “why nots” and couldn’t pretend I didn’t like girls anymore. This made her uncomfortable, at one point she thought I LIKED HER (Respectfully I could never put up with miss prissy, had to get her way, diva….and she would hate my country music…we’re like Fire and Water😂😅) 
I’m surprised we stayed friends for so long but she was my Clair and I was her Serena (gossip girls) opposite’s attract I guess…
One day I had my insta account logged into her instagram app on her tablet…and I messaged a confession page asking if it’s ok I, a Christian, stay in choir while I was bi and bla bla bla. Fast forward to MONTHS LATER I was sneaking out with a boy and cutting my hair which is a BIG NO NO in the church….
Her knowing all this way fine, until she receives a message back from that confession page and reads my confession….
I get a knock on the door and the pastor walks in and basically him, his wife, and my parents corner me and demand the “rumors” to be put to rest so I must tell the truth, i watered down the truth and I guess I was let off easy. I realized Ashely hasn’t texted in a week and has been avoiding me, I had a gut feeling and asked her straight up “did you tell everyone I was bi?” She didn’t even hesitate and explained everything “I did it cause I love you, I didn’t know how to handle this” which I can understand, pressure from the church to be a goody two shoes 24/7 and to make it to heaven will get you to turn on the ones closest to ya.
But she had no right telling my business like that, she could’ve just talked to me??
Anyway, I stopped talking to her for a month and then went back and tried to mend the friendship, basically she said “I’m sorry to hurt your feelings but I wasn’t in the wrong” and my no backbone self just said ok and befriended her again
But we eventually drifted apart and stopped talking again…fast forward a year and a half later we started being civil then slowly started small talk then I popped the question “wanna grab coffee sometime?” And she said “yeah, sound good” 
She’s like a sister to me, I still love her despite of what happened and I kept my distance and set boundaries but it doesn’t feel right to not be friends. But I’m not a church girly anymore and she’s fully devoted. Idk how well this would mix
And I’m not sure what I’m doing, I recently lost both my grandparents and I feel like I shouldn’t take loved ones for granted….or maybe I’m being delulu trying to mend something that shouldn’t be mended. I don’t hate her and I never have, but losing her as a friend and her family felt like grief as well. And I guess I wanna talk to her about it??
Got any advice on how to move forward? I tried giving as much context as possible. 
Be blunt, slap me in the face if you have to…but this doesn’t feel wrong? I guess idk what I’m doing ",4,1739153948.0,TwoHotTakes,5,0.83,False
