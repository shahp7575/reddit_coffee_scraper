1g8k8c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1g8k8c7/my_weird_experiences_with_caffeine/,My weird experiences with caffeine,"So this isn‚Äôt what people who see things as all good or all bad want to read, but here it goes anyway‚Ä¶

I always enjoyed my mate until I didn‚Äôt. I enjoyed my coffee until I didn‚Äôt. So, I just stopped drinking them and felt better‚Ä¶ but not completely. Meanwhile, some people still enjoyed their coffee with no side effects, sleeping like babies. That‚Äôs when the ‚Äúcoffee gene theory‚Äù came up, which IMHO is BS. I mean, years of a good relationship with coffee until something happens, and suddenly it‚Äôs ‚ÄúOh, the honeymoon is over.‚Äù Yeah, maybe. But not 100% because of the coffee.

In my case, what were the things that ruined me to the point where I couldn‚Äôt even handle mate or coffee anymore? I identified a few:

	1.	I went through some difficult life situations‚Äîheavy traumas‚Äîthat led to stress and anxiety.

	2.	That led me to eat crap food, which caused inflammation in my body. My sleep quality was decimated by stress, traumas, and anxiety.

	3.	This inflammation led me to develop fat around my midsection, specifically the lower part.

	4.	Then I tried ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù that, even though they might work for 1-2-3 months, ended up making things worse: keto and calorie restriction. One thing I learned is that if you‚Äôre drinking coffee, you should actually eat carbs. Otherwise, it‚Äôs like pressing the gas pedal with no fuel‚Ä¶ or with a very slow-burning fuel (fat), forcing your body to pull from muscle stores.

So, up to that point, you can see all the messed up things that had nothing to do with coffee, right?

	5.	This calorie restriction and keto wrecked my hormonal balance, skyrocketed my stress, and sent my anxiety through the roof.

	6.	And then‚Ä¶ blame the coffee.



But over the last 18 months, I‚Äôve been fixing those issues. And these changes have made the difference‚Äînot quitting coffee. In fact, there have been nights when I drank caffeine (via the occasional Coke) and still slept way better.



What have I done?

	1.	Followed a diet like Paul Saladino or Jay Feldmann, 90%+ of the time. The massive change in food made me start enjoying real food and feel disgusted by trash food.

	2.	Gym 2-3 times a week.

	3.	Walking 12k+ steps per day.

	4.	I stopped going crazy about work. I did less and respected my body. The company is not my life, and I‚Äôm definitely not theirs.

	5.	Meditated sometimes‚Äînot every day as I should, but hey, I can‚Äôt change everything at once, right? That‚Äôs another thing: I don‚Äôt overthink it, and I‚Äôm more forgiving with myself for not doing everything perfectly.

	6.	I started swimming, doing cold baths, and using the sauna.

	7.	Of course, I cut out alcohol and cigarettes.



So, as you can see, there are a lot of things that have nothing to do with coffee. Coffee is like adding a bit of water to a bucket‚Äîits effect depends on whether your bucket is already full or empty. And of course, moderation is key. 400mg of caffeine per day is too much. I think a good limit is 150-200mg per day, and nothing after 2pm.",0,1729496508.0,decaf,0,0.33,False

1g8k5tg,https://i.redd.it/8omdeol1c2wd1.jpeg,Questions about this shrine and related questions ,"Hi! This shrine is in my local nail salon. I asked the lady who did my nails about it and she said it was for good luck and to bring in customers but she didn't understand my other questions and got another guy to tell me about it. Funny enough, he didn't know much about it as he said he's Catholic other than telling me what some of the items were (coffee, tea, incense). 

I'm just wondering if anyone can explain the significance of any of these items. I found some information on Google but not much. 

I did ask if it was ok to take a picture of it. 

During my Google search, I was reminded there is a Vietnamese Buddhist temple near me. I've wanted to visit when I pass however I wasn't sure if that's ok to do. I read through their website using Google translate and see they sell candy to fund their temple and it looks like they sell the candy onsite. 

So my questions are: would it be ok to visit and buy candy? I'm not concerned with a language barrier, I just want to make sure it wouldn't be seen as rude to come in as a non Buddhist and non Vietnamese speaking person. I enjoy visiting religious buildings of any kind. If that's ok, how can I be respectful and are there any words or short phrases I can use to be polite like titles, greetings, and 'thank you's'?

1g8k30f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1g8k30f/i_should_have_stayed_in_bed/,I Should Have Stayed In Bed,"My eyes blinked open to the soft, pale glow of the morning light filtering through the curtains. I lay still, my body sunken into the familiar dip on my side of the bed, the weight of sleep lingering in my limbs. The silence was comforting, and I reached across the mattress, expecting to feel the warmth of my wife beside me.

Her side was empty.

I frowned, my fingers brushing the cold, undisturbed sheets. Lisa never woke before me on her days off. I pushed the thought aside, trying to shake off the lingering fog of sleep. Maybe she‚Äôd gone to the bathroom or been called into the ER last minute. They were always short-staffed these days.

I glanced at the old wooden clock hanging above the dresser.

6:17 AM.

Too early for Lisa. My stomach knotted with unease, but I told myself not to worry yet. Maybe she was downstairs, making breakfast. I sat up, rubbing my eyes, and was greeted by Middow, our cat. He wove between my legs, his purring loud and insistent. I reached down to stroke him absentmindedly before stumbling into the bathroom, the chill of the house creeping into my skin.

The stillness of the house unnerved me as I splashed cold water on my face. The only sound was the soft hum of the heater kicking on, filling the empty spaces with a mechanical, distant drone. I pulled on my housecoat and headed down the dimly lit hallway, Middow at my heels.

Coffee first. 

The thought was comforting‚Äîroutine. I moved toward the kitchen, but something stopped me.

Middow‚Äôs bowl was empty. Strange. Lisa was always the first to feed him in the mornings. A flicker of confusion passed through me, and my gaze fell on her purse, hanging from the back of the kitchen chair. Her car keys were still on the rack by the front door.

A sense of unease prickled at the back of my neck. I crossed the room to the living room window, brushing aside the heavy curtains. The landscape outside was barren under the pale winter sky, the frost glistening in the early morning light. Lisa‚Äôs car sat in the driveway, untouched.

‚ÄúBabe? You home?‚Äù I called, my voice sounding hollow in the stillness.

No answer.

I fed Middow, his purring louder than ever, as the coffee maker began its slow drip. I waited, tapping my fingers against the counter, trying to shake the creeping dread building in my chest. Something was off. I grabbed my phone from the bedroom, hoping for a message. Nothing. I hit the call button, but my heart sank when I heard her ringtone‚Äîa familiar melody vibrating from her nightstand.

She hadn‚Äôt taken her phone.

Now the worry set in, sharp and sudden. I threw on yesterday‚Äôs clothes, my fingers fumbling as I laced up my shoes, and stepped outside. The cold air hit me like a slap, biting through my thin layers. The house stood alone on the outskirts of town, fields and forest stretching for miles. There was no movement‚Äîno sound but the whistle of the wind through the trees.

Then I saw her.

Lisa stood at the far edge of the property, just before the dark line of trees that bordered our land. She was still in her pajamas, her thin silk nightgown a stark contrast to the frozen landscape. Her back was to the forest, facing me, unmoving.

‚ÄúLisa?‚Äù I called, my voice quivering slightly. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? It‚Äôs freezing out here!‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt move. She didn‚Äôt respond.

I took a few steps toward her, my heart pounding harder with each one. A strange sense of dread clawed at my chest.

As I approached, she began to move‚Äîbackward. She was still facing me, but her steps were slow, deliberate, retreating into the shadows of the forest. The trees seemed to swallow her whole.

‚ÄúLisa!‚Äù I yelled, breaking into a run. ‚ÄúWait! Stop!‚Äù

She disappeared into the trees.

I stopped at the edge of the forest, the towering pines looming overhead, casting long, dark shadows across the frozen ground. The cold felt sharper here, biting deeper, as if the forest itself was colder than the rest of the world.

I hesitated, my breath clouding the air in front of me. Everything about this was wrong. Lisa hated the cold. She wouldn‚Äôt wander into the woods in a nightgown, not in this weather.

I took a deep breath and stepped forward, crossing the threshold into the trees.

The world changed instantly. The sounds of the wind and the distant hum of the house disappeared, replaced by an oppressive silence. My footsteps were muted on the frozen ground, the air thick with an eerie stillness.

‚ÄúLisa?‚Äù I called, my voice small in the vastness of the woods.

No answer. The trees crowded in on me, their dark branches like twisted fingers reaching toward the sky. I moved deeper, my eyes straining to see through the thick underbrush. Every shadow seemed to shift, every tree standing like a silent, watching sentinel. The cold bit through my clothes, but I pressed on, my pulse quickening with each step.

Then I heard it‚Äîa voice, soft and distant, carried on the wind.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Edgarrrr‚Ä¶‚Äù

I froze. It was Lisa‚Äôs voice, but something about it was wrong. Too delicate. Too close.

‚ÄúLisa?‚Äù I called, spinning around. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

The silence pressed in, thick and suffocating. Then, once again, the voice came.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Edgar, this waaay‚Ä¶‚Äù

The voice echoed from deeper in the woods, sending a shiver down my spine. Without thinking, I ran toward it, the panic now fully taking hold. Branches whipped at my face, roots seemed to rise up from the ground, snagging my feet and tearing at my clothes. The cold air burned in my lungs as I stumbled through the forest.

Finally, I broke through the trees into a large clearing. The ground was frozen, barren, and lifeless, the trees forming a circle around me like towering sentinels. At the far edge of the clearing, I saw her‚ÄîLisa. She was hunched over, her back to me, her nightgown streaked with dirt and blood. Her shoulders shook with soft, pitiful sobs.

‚ÄúLisa?‚Äù My voice cracked, tears of relief welling in my eyes.

Before I could take a step, my phone buzzed violently in my pocket. Startled, I pulled it out and glanced at the screen.

It was Lisa‚Äôs number.

A cold wave of confusion and dread crashed over me. I looked from the phone to the figure in the clearing, my heart pounding in my ears.

With a shaking hand, I answered. ‚ÄúH-Hello?‚Äù

‚ÄúEdgar?‚Äù Lisa‚Äôs voice came through, frantic and full of fear. ‚ÄúWhere are you? I‚Äôve been trying to call you for hours!‚Äù

My throat tightened. ‚ÄúWhat? I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in the woods. Where are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm at home!‚Äù she cried. ‚ÄúI went out for breakfast with Lacey, and when I came back, you were gone! I‚Äôve been calling and calling!‚Äù

I stared at the figure in the clearing, still sobbing, still covered in blood.

My mind reeled as I struggled to make sense of what was happening. ‚ÄúLisa‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre home‚Ä¶ then who‚Ä¶?‚Äù

The line cut out, the phone in my hand going dead as the battery drained in an instant. I stared at the dark screen, a cold sweat breaking out across my skin.

The sobbing stopped, but was replaced with a soft, creeping giggle.

Her arms hung at strange angles, twisted and contorted unnaturally. She took a step backwards towards me, then another, her body jerking and spasming with each movement.

‚ÄúRun,‚Äù she whispered, her voice no longer human.

I didn‚Äôt wait. I turned and ran, my feet barely touching the ground as I tore through the forest. The laughter echoed behind me, growing louder and more hysterical, a sound that chilled me to my very core. My heart pounded, my breath came in ragged gasps, and still, I ran, faster than I ever thought possible.

Branches lashed at me, roots tripped me, but I didn‚Äôt stop. I could hear her‚Äîno, it‚Äîclosing in, its twisted limbs crashing through the underbrush, its laughter ringing in my ears.

Finally, the edge of the woods came into view. I threw myself through the trees and collapsed onto the frozen grass, gasping for air.

When I opened my eyes, I was surrounded by paramedics, friends, and Lisa. The real Lisa. She was holding my head in her lap, her face streaked with tears.

They told me I‚Äôd been missing for six hours.

I said nothing. I couldn‚Äôt explain what had happened. No one would believe me if I tried. So I told them I didn‚Äôt remember anything after making coffee that morning.

But I know what I saw.

They kept me in the hospital for a few days, running tests and scans of my brain to make sure my ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù wasn‚Äôt related to something serious. 

When the tests came back clear, I was prescribed some medication and ordered to see a psychiatrist once a month for three months. And then they sent me home with a note granting me one month of paid leave from work.

Lisa took a couple of weeks off of work to stay with me. She never left my side. Wherever I was, she was. Admittedly, it was hard looking at her the same way after what happened. I felt paranoid, uneasy. Terrified that whatever chased me through the woods was still out there, just waiting for me to come back.

Or maybe it would come for me in the night.

I hardly sleep anymore. I spend my nights listening to the ticking clock above the dresser while who I think is Lisa sleeps soundly next to me.

A few days ago, I was in the basement doing the laundry. It‚Äôs a chore that both Lisa and I tend to procrastinate on. I pulled out an armful of dirty clothes from the overflowing laundry basket and stuffed them into the washer. 

I looked back into the basket and froze. In the bottom of the basket was Lisa‚Äôs nightgown‚Äîthe same one that thing had been wearing in the woods. An awful feeling blanketed over me as flashbacks filled my head.

It became worse when I reached in and pulled it out.

I frowned, my fingers brushing the cold, undisturbed sheets. Lisa never woke before me on her days off. I pushed the thought aside, trying to shake off the lingering fog of sleep. Maybe she‚Äôd gone to the bathroom or been called into the ER last minute. They were always short-staffed these days.

I glanced at the old wooden clock hanging above the dresser.

6:17 AM.

Too early for Lisa. My stomach knotted with unease, but I told myself not to worry yet. Maybe she was downstairs, making breakfast. I sat up, rubbing my eyes, and was greeted by Middow, our cat. He wove between my legs, his purring loud and insistent. I reached down to stroke him absentmindedly before stumbling into the bathroom, the chill of the house creeping into my skin.

The stillness of the house unnerved me as I splashed cold water on my face. The only sound was the soft hum of the heater kicking on, filling the empty spaces with a mechanical, distant drone. I pulled on my housecoat and headed down the dimly lit hallway, Middow at my heels.

Coffee first. 

The thought was comforting‚Äîroutine. I moved toward the kitchen, but something stopped me.

Middow‚Äôs bowl was empty. Strange. Lisa was always the first to feed him in the mornings. A flicker of confusion passed through me, and my gaze fell on her purse, hanging from the back of the kitchen chair. Her car keys were still on the rack by the front door.

A sense of unease prickled at the back of my neck. I crossed the room to the living room window, brushing aside the heavy curtains. The landscape outside was barren under the pale winter sky, the frost glistening in the early morning light. Lisa‚Äôs car sat in the driveway, untouched.

‚ÄúBabe? You home?‚Äù I called, my voice sounding hollow in the stillness.

No answer.

I fed Middow, his purring louder than ever, as the coffee maker began its slow drip. I waited, tapping my fingers against the counter, trying to shake the creeping dread building in my chest. Something was off. I grabbed my phone from the bedroom, hoping for a message. Nothing. I hit the call button, but my heart sank when I heard her ringtone‚Äîa familiar melody vibrating from her nightstand.

She hadn‚Äôt taken her phone.

Now the worry set in, sharp and sudden. I threw on yesterday‚Äôs clothes, my fingers fumbling as I laced up my shoes, and stepped outside. The cold air hit me like a slap, biting through my thin layers. The house stood alone on the outskirts of town, fields and forest stretching for miles. There was no movement‚Äîno sound but the whistle of the wind through the trees.

Then I saw her.

Lisa stood at the far edge of the property, just before the dark line of trees that bordered our land. She was still in her pajamas, her thin silk nightgown a stark contrast to the frozen landscape. Her back was to the forest, facing me, unmoving.

‚ÄúLisa?‚Äù I called, my voice quivering slightly. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? It‚Äôs freezing out here!‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt move. She didn‚Äôt respond.

I took a few steps toward her, my heart pounding harder with each one. A strange sense of dread clawed at my chest.

As I approached, she began to move‚Äîbackward. She was still facing me, but her steps were slow, deliberate, retreating into the shadows of the forest. The trees seemed to swallow her whole.

‚ÄúLisa!‚Äù I yelled, breaking into a run. ‚ÄúWait! Stop!‚Äù

She disappeared into the trees.

I stopped at the edge of the forest, the towering pines looming overhead, casting long, dark shadows across the frozen ground. The cold felt sharper here, biting deeper, as if the forest itself was colder than the rest of the world.

I hesitated, my breath clouding the air in front of me. Everything about this was wrong. Lisa hated the cold. She wouldn‚Äôt wander into the woods in a nightgown, not in this weather.

I took a deep breath and stepped forward, crossing the threshold into the trees.

The world changed instantly. The sounds of the wind and the distant hum of the house disappeared, replaced by an oppressive silence. My footsteps were muted on the frozen ground, the air thick with an eerie stillness.

‚ÄúLisa?‚Äù I called, my voice small in the vastness of the woods.

No answer. The trees crowded in on me, their dark branches like twisted fingers reaching toward the sky. I moved deeper, my eyes straining to see through the thick underbrush. Every shadow seemed to shift, every tree standing like a silent, watching sentinel. The cold bit through my clothes, but I pressed on, my pulse quickening with each step.

Then I heard it‚Äîa voice, soft and distant, carried on the wind.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Edgarrrr‚Ä¶‚Äù

I froze. It was Lisa‚Äôs voice, but something about it was wrong. Too delicate. Too close.

‚ÄúLisa?‚Äù I called, spinning around. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

The silence pressed in, thick and suffocating. Then, once again, the voice came.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Edgar, this waaay‚Ä¶‚Äù

The voice echoed from deeper in the woods, sending a shiver down my spine. Without thinking, I ran toward it, the panic now fully taking hold. Branches whipped at my face, roots seemed to rise up from the ground, snagging my feet and tearing at my clothes. The cold air burned in my lungs as I stumbled through the forest.

Finally, I broke through the trees into a large clearing. The ground was frozen, barren, and lifeless, the trees forming a circle around me like towering sentinels. At the far edge of the clearing, I saw her‚ÄîLisa. She was hunched over, her back to me, her nightgown streaked with dirt and blood. Her shoulders shook with soft, pitiful sobs.

‚ÄúLisa?‚Äù My voice cracked, tears of relief welling in my eyes.

Before I could take a step, my phone buzzed violently in my pocket. Startled, I pulled it out and glanced at the screen.

It was Lisa‚Äôs number.

A cold wave of confusion and dread crashed over me. I looked from the phone to the figure in the clearing, my heart pounding in my ears.

With a shaking hand, I answered. ‚ÄúH-Hello?‚Äù

‚ÄúEdgar?‚Äù Lisa‚Äôs voice came through, frantic and full of fear. ‚ÄúWhere are you? I‚Äôve been trying to call you for hours!‚Äù

My throat tightened. ‚ÄúWhat? I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in the woods. Where are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm at home!‚Äù she cried. ‚ÄúI went out for breakfast with Lacey, and when I came back, you were gone! I‚Äôve been calling and calling!‚Äù

I stared at the figure in the clearing, still sobbing, still covered in blood.

My mind reeled as I struggled to make sense of what was happening. ‚ÄúLisa‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre home‚Ä¶ then who‚Ä¶?‚Äù

The line cut out, the phone in my hand going dead as the battery drained in an instant. I stared at the dark screen, a cold sweat breaking out across my skin.

The sobbing stopped, but was replaced with a soft, creeping giggle.

Her arms hung at strange angles, twisted and contorted unnaturally. She took a step backwards towards me, then another, her body jerking and spasming with each movement.

‚ÄúRun,‚Äù she whispered, her voice no longer human.

I didn‚Äôt wait. I turned and ran, my feet barely touching the ground as I tore through the forest. The laughter echoed behind me, growing louder and more hysterical, a sound that chilled me to my very core. My heart pounded, my breath came in ragged gasps, and still, I ran, faster than I ever thought possible.

Branches lashed at me, roots tripped me, but I didn‚Äôt stop. I could hear her‚Äîno, it‚Äîclosing in, its twisted limbs crashing through the underbrush, its laughter ringing in my ears.

Finally, the edge of the woods came into view. I threw myself through the trees and collapsed onto the frozen grass, gasping for air.

When I opened my eyes, I was surrounded by paramedics, friends, and Lisa. The real Lisa. She was holding my head in her lap, her face streaked with tears.

They told me I‚Äôd been missing for six hours.

I said nothing. I couldn‚Äôt explain what had happened. No one would believe me if I tried. So I told them I didn‚Äôt remember anything after making coffee that morning.

But I know what I saw.

They kept me in the hospital for a few days, running tests and scans of my brain to make sure my ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù wasn‚Äôt related to something serious. 

When the tests came back clear, I was prescribed some medication and ordered to see a psychiatrist once a month for three months. And then they sent me home with a note granting me one month of paid leave from work.

Lisa took a couple of weeks off of work to stay with me. She never left my side. Wherever I was, she was. Admittedly, it was hard looking at her the same way after what happened. I felt paranoid, uneasy. Terrified that whatever chased me through the woods was still out there, just waiting for me to come back.

Or maybe it would come for me in the night.

I hardly sleep anymore. I spend my nights listening to the ticking clock above the dresser while who I think is Lisa sleeps soundly next to me.

A few days ago, I was in the basement doing the laundry. It‚Äôs a chore that both Lisa and I tend to procrastinate on. I pulled out an armful of dirty clothes from the overflowing laundry basket and stuffed them into the washer. 

I looked back into the basket and froze. In the bottom of the basket was Lisa‚Äôs nightgown‚Äîthe same one that thing had been wearing in the woods. An awful feeling blanketed over me as flashbacks filled my head.

It became worse when I reached in and pulled it out.

Her nightgown was tattered and torn, stained with dirt and dried blood.",1,1729495744.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm hunched over my laptop, troubleshooting a bug that *shouldn‚Äôt even exist*. My eyes are burning, my coffee's cold, and my phone's notification ping is *mocking* me. Another support ticket. I glance at the clock‚Äî14 straight hours of coding. Again.

When I started this SaaS project, I thought it‚Äôd be my dream‚Äîfreedom, no bosses, just me running the show. But instead of freedom, I got an endless grind. As a solo dev, I was doing everything: coding, support, marketing, server maintenance.

My social life? Non-existent. Exercise? Yeah, right. Sleep? Forget it.

The breaking point hit hard two months ago. After a 16-hour marathon workday, I realized I hadn‚Äôt spoken to another human in days. I hadn‚Äôt stepped outside in *three* days. And the bug? Still unresolved. It finally clicked‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt running this project anymore. It was running me.

*But here‚Äôs the twist*: I took control. I started scheduling proper breaks, stepping away from my screen, and outsourcing where I could. I learned to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to overworking myself. The work-life balance I thought was impossible? I made it happen.

Now, two months later, everything is back on track. The SaaS is growing, but *I‚Äôm* not drowning. I‚Äôm sleeping again, talking to real people, and even exercising.

TL;DR: You don‚Äôt have to sacrifice your sanity to build something great. Take control before burnout hits‚Äîit‚Äôs a game-changer. üí°",1,1729495014.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm here because life‚Äôs a blast, but it‚Äôd be even better with someone to jump around (literally) and share all the fun, laughs, and crazy experiences with. üòé

**About Me:**

I‚Äôm a 25-year-old globetrotter, originally from Karachi, raised in the UAE, and now kicking it in Canada (UAE's jaan though <3). My life motto? ‚ÄúWhy stay in one place when you can explore the world?‚Äù Next stop: Spain, because who says no to pizza in the sun? üçï At 5‚Äô6"", I‚Äôm just the right height to fit into cozy couple selfies and reach the snacks on the top shelf (don‚Äôt worry, I got you covered)

I run a startup here in Canada and also work as a Senior Product Manager for a company based in Pakistan & the Middle East‚Äîso yeah, my passport is pretty active! When I‚Äôm not working, I‚Äôm either shopping for sneakers (I‚Äôm a total sneakerhead, you‚Äôve been warned) or trying to find the best coffee spot in town. ‚òï

Oh, and I have 12 cats. Yep, you read that right. If that doesn‚Äôt scare you off, we‚Äôre already off to a solid start. üòÇ

**What I‚Äôm Looking For:**

I‚Äôm on the lookout for a **good-looking**, **fun-loving**

If you‚Äôre the type who can keep me on my toes, make spontaneous plans, and still be chill with my sneaker shopping addiction, you‚Äôre exactly who I‚Äôm looking for.

**Fun Facts:**

* I can‚Äôt go a day without trying coffee from a new caf√©‚Äîit‚Äôs an addiction, and I‚Äôm not sorry about it.
* My sense of humor? Mostly bad jokes and relentless teasing. You‚Äôll need to be able to take a joke or two. üòâ
* Cats? I‚Äôve got a *whole squad* at home. 12 cats, 12 personalities‚Äîlife‚Äôs never boring!
* I own way too many sneakers (is there such a thing?), and I‚Äôm always looking for my next pair. So yeah, you‚Äôll probably catch me sneaker-shopping more than I should. You'd mostly find my things in your cupboard or you can pay my netflix subscription to get some space for yourself.

**Deal Breakers:**

* If you‚Äôre not into coffee or cats, this probably won‚Äôt work out (kidding, but not really‚Ä¶).
* Stinginess. I can‚Äôt hang with that!
* Not into traveling? How will we make all those epic memories (and pics) together? üì∏
* No sense of humor? We‚Äôd be like a pizza without cheese. üçï Sad times.

On a serious note, if you think you can keep up with my adventures, appreciate the finer things in life (like sneakers, coffee, and cats with attitude), and are ready for spontaneous plans filled with laughs and caffeine highs + if you want some fun dholki‚Äôs, mehndi and peak level baraat, hit me up!

As i stated in my last post, i‚Äôve had this cutie for a year now and i wanted to share some things that we‚Äôve learned about her during that time! First off, we learned that she is still figuring out what loafing is üôÇ Actually, i‚Äôm sure she knows how but she LOVES striking poses. 
We also figured out that she LOVES shoes. If we go somewhere, she‚Äôs very quick to explore our shoes when we come back. I think she‚Äôs very curious about what it‚Äôs like outside but the poor girl is too frightened to go out there. üò™ We haven‚Äôt tried to push her to go outside anyway since she only has her back claws, but we do bring insects and bugs inside for her to chase since we found out that she LOVES moths and gnats lol.
Figured out that she hates when i take pictures of her, she‚Äôs very quick to walk away or stare at me like i offended her lol BUT guess what else we found out? she loves being under blankets‚Ä¶and warm towels? If I‚Äôm under a blanket, she‚Äôll walk over to me and push her face into my leg until i share the blanket with her, i guess sharing is caring.üòÆ‚Äçüí®
Last thing that i figured out about this gem is that she‚Äôs SUPER curious. Loves going the tv, climbing on the tv stand, knocking down things on shelves, peaking over the coffee table and dining room table (surprisingly she‚Äôs never climbed on the tables before!)
It‚Äôs honestly been a blessing getting to know Star, she‚Äôs really brightened up this house and i hope that we‚Äôve brightened up her life because she‚Äôs opened up SO much this year, it‚Äôs amazing. So yeah, that‚Äôs my fur baby for you. Thank you for reading if you made it this far :) I have so much more that i could say about her but i feel like I‚Äôve already typed a lot so I‚Äôll end this here!!üòä

Na-realize ko lang noon na gusto ko palang mapag-isa, figure out my own path, and decide for myself without having to consider anyone else. I‚Äôm not sure about marriage. It was a mutual break up dahil alam niya rin sa sarili niya na marami pa siyang ibang gustong gawin. Hindi kami nag away. Walang third party. Walang nag try mag date ng iba.

I admit na nawala na yung attraction between us. Sobrang dami kasi naming pinagdaanan together and nung natapos na yung storms, naging clear to us na we want to be single. But we know we have so much love for each other.

We stayed as friends. On our last conversation, we joked na we could still flirt with one another. Since we‚Äôre both not planning to meet new people naman, maybe we could still have fun together. In simpler terms, we downgraded our relationship. But no, we are not fuck buddies. We‚Äôre really just best friends.

Hindi kami nag iwasan. He calls when he wants to talk and I answer when I‚Äôm available. We still share our Netflix, Disney+, and OneDrive accounts. Our shared bank account, di pa rin namin hinahati yung laman. I still come visit kapag may family gatherings sila, he still talks to my siblings and best friends. Everything is chill and I am happy. I got the perfect break up that I wanted. I am able to focus on my health, faith, and career, without losing a very important person.

But then recently, may mga sumusubok na ulit mag pursue sa akin. My love language is receiving gifts and habit ko talaga na when I receive something, I‚Äôll share it.

Last week, I received a designer perfume from some guy. Although admittedly, hindi ko gusto yung scent kasi it‚Äôs floral, I really appreciated the gesture. When my ex saw it, he asked if I liked it. I said, ‚Äúno‚Äù. He said, ‚Äúsabi na eh‚Äù. A couple of days later, he sent me a niche perfume na sa Europe niya pa pinabili. He ordered it na pala a few weeks ago and he was planning to give it to me for Christmas pero binigay na niya agad para daw may new perfume ako na gusto ko yung scent.

Yesterday, I received a coffee delivery from another guy. My ex knowing that I no longer drink coffee, responded to it and sent ice cream right away. He said para daw di ako ma-tempt to drink the coffee because it‚Äôs bawal. He even got my favorite flavor. And then this afternoon, he saw that I liked a video of this restaurant that I‚Äôve been wanting to try, sabi niya he‚Äôll take me there on Wednesday.

Next week, he‚Äôs buying a new car and gusto niya na sumama ako when he picks it up.

Hay I am probably being delusional. But kinikilig ako. Hahaha. I do believe in second chances and I think we both deserve it. But I don‚Äôt want to move too fast. May valid reason yung break up namin and I know na hindi pa ako ready. Still, I am happy with what we have and I hope napapasaya ko rin siya.",1,1729493925.0,OffMyChestPH,1,0.67,False

-------------------------------------------------------------

Scandinavian house design plans stand out due to their simplicity, functionality, and connection to nature. By focusing on minimalist aesthetics combined with efficient use of space, these plans cater to modern living while offering a serene atmosphere. If you are considering building or renovating your home, understanding the key features of this design philosophy can help guide your decisions.

One defining characteristic of Scandinavian design is the emphasis on natural light. Many plans feature large windows that allow sunlight to flood the interior. This not only brightens up the space but also creates an inviting and airy environment. Here are some elements to look for:

- **Floor-to-ceiling windows:** These create a seamless connection between the indoors and outdoors, allowing for stunning views and abundant light.
- **Open floor plans:** This design fosters a feeling of spaciousness and facilitates natural light flow throughout different areas of the home.
- **Light color palettes:** Soft whites, beiges, and pastels help to reflect light, making even smaller spaces feel larger and more open.

Another important aspect of Scandinavian house design plans is their focus on functionality. Every part of the home is designed with purpose and efficiency in mind. This means that storage solutions are cleverly integrated into the structure. You can expect to find:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/scandinavian-house-design-plans  
  
- **Built-in furniture:** Items like benches or shelves are often built directly into the walls, saving space and minimizing clutter.
- **Multi-functional spaces:** Rooms might serve more than one purpose, such as a guest room that doubles as a home office.
- **Efficient layouts:** Scandinavian designs often maximize usable space, ensuring that every square foot serves a function.

Those who appreciate a strong connection to the environment will find Scandinavian house design plans comforting. This philosophy often emphasizes eco-friendliness and sustainability. Some features that support this theme include:

- **Natural materials:** Wood, stone, and wool are common materials, providing a warm and inviting atmosphere.
- **Energy efficiency:** Houses are often designed to use resources wisely, incorporating insulation and energy-efficient windows to minimize heating needs.
- **Sustainable practices:** These buildings may also include energy-saving appliances and rainwater harvesting systems.

Another key feature is the integration of indoor and outdoor spaces. Scandinavian design emphasizes the importance of nature, which is evident in the use of outdoor spaces. Here are a few ways this principle is reflected:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/scandinavian-house-design-plans  
  
- **Outdoor living areas:** Decks, patios, or balconies encourage outdoor activities while providing additional living space.
- **Landscaping:** Native plants and simple designs help fold the home seamlessly into its surroundings.
- **Natural views:** Designs often position rooms to maximize natural views, further extending the living environment.

In addition to aesthetics and environmental friendliness, Scandinavian design also values comfort. This is achieved through a well-thought-out layout and the selection of materials that promote coziness. Here are a few comfort-oriented features you can expect:

- **Textured fabrics:** Soft textiles like wool, linen, or cotton are commonly used in furniture and decor, adding warmth and comfort.
- **Neutral color schemes:** Soothing colors contribute to a sense of calm, making the home feel like a safe retreat.
- **Warm lighting:** Lighting fixtures are often designed to create a cozy atmosphere, with soft, warm bulbs being the preferred choice.

Scandinavian house design plans are a balanced combination of minimalist aesthetics, functionality, environmental awareness, and comfort. These features are designed to promote a harmonious lifestyle where inhabitants can enjoy their surroundings. When considering your own home design, reflecting on these attributes can inspire a sanctuary that is both beautiful and practical.

By integrating these key principles into your house design planning, you can create a living space that aligns with the Scandinavian ethos. Ultimately, the result will be a home that is not only stylish and efficient but also deeply connected to the natural world.

Tips for Incorporating Scandinavian Elements into Your Home Renovation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you thinking about renovating your home and want to add a touch of Scandinavian charm? Scandinavian design is known for its simplicity, functionality, and beauty. By incorporating these elements into your home renovation, you can create a space that feels warm, welcoming, and stylish. Here are some tips to help you embrace this beautiful design style.

### Focus on Light and Space

One of the first principles of Scandinavian design is the emphasis on light. Large windows are key to bringing the outdoors in. If your home allows, consider enlarging your windows or using light curtains to maximize natural light. Think about open floor plans that create an airy feel.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/scandinavian-house-design-plans  
  
To enhance this light-filled atmosphere, use light-colored walls and ceilings. Shades of white, soft grays, and soothing pastels work well. This not only helps reflect light but also creates a neutral backdrop for your decor.

### Choose Functional Furniture

Scandinavian design champions functionality. Invest in furniture that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical. Look for pieces that can serve multiple purposes, such as a coffee table with storage space or a sofa bed for accommodating guests.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/scandinavian-house-design-plans  
  
When selecting furniture, opt for clean lines and simple shapes. Furniture made from natural materials, like wood, cotton, and linen, fits perfectly within this style. The aim is to strike a balance between beauty and usability.

### Embrace Minimalism

Less is more! Scandinavian interiors are known for their minimalist approach. Clear out any clutter and prioritize items that you truly love and need. Not only does this create a more serene environment, but it also allows each item to stand out.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/scandinavian-house-design-plans  
  
You can achieve a minimalist look by:

- Limiting decor pieces to a few key items.
- Using functional home accessories such as stylish storage baskets.
- Creating a sense of peace with open spaces and fewer distractions.

### Add Warm Textiles

While Scandinavian design features clean lines and minimalism, warmth is essential. textiles can add coziness to your space. Choose soft-colored throws, plush rugs, and comfortable cushions to bring a sense of comfort. Wool, cotton, and other natural textiles are ideal choices.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/scandinavian-house-design-plans  
  
Layering textiles in different textures and patterns can create a stunning visual appeal while remaining understated. Think about combining a knitted throw with a soft sheepskin rug or linen pillows for a tactile experience.

### Integrate Nature Into Your Space

Bringing nature indoors is a key element of Scandinavian design. Consider using plants, flowers, or even natural wood accents to enhance your home‚Äôs aesthetic. Large potted plants, hanging greenery, or small succulents can breathe life into your living spaces.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/scandinavian-house-design-plans  
  
Additionally, using natural wood elements in your renovation can add warmth. Exposed beams, wooden furniture, or timber accent walls create an inviting atmosphere that reflects the beauty of nature.

### Opt for Soft Lighting

Lighting is crucial in Scandinavian design. Instead of relying solely on overhead fixtures, layer your lighting to create a cozy environment. Use floor lamps, table lamps, and wall sconces to provide various light sources.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/scandinavian-house-design-plans  
  
Choose light fixtures with simple designs that complement your d√©cor. Soft white bulbs can create a warm glow, making your space feel inviting and comfortable during the darker months.

### Choose a Neutral Color Palette

While Scandinavian design allows for pops of color, the foundation is usually neutral. Stick to a color palette made up of whites, grays, and earthy tones. You can add bursts of color through accessories or artwork that can easily be swapped out as trends change.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/scandinavian-house-design-plans  
  
This approach not only makes your space easy to decorate but also keeps it feeling fresh and modern for years to come.

By incorporating these Scandinavian elements into your home renovation, you can create a stylish, functional, and warm environment. Your space will not only reflect your aesthetic preferences but also embody the essence of comfort and simplicity that Scandinavian design is known for. Happy renovating!

By understanding the key features of these designs‚Äîsuch as open floor plans, ample natural light, and a focus on nature‚Äîyou can create a home that feels both spacious and inviting. Integrating these elements into your existing renovation can transform your space, bringing a fresh and calming ambiance that reflects the essence of Scandinavian style.

1g8jncj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g8jncj,Nobara Kugisaki and my school ID fantasy ,".... If you are among the less than handful that have been following my increasingly concerning posts in the menagerie of nsfw jjk subs then you know that I have a very specific kink. Now, be warned, this isn't one of those ""toe sucking, ass licking"" type freakiness - this is that news headline worthy employment ending digital footprint ""I can't even lie, this mfer needs to go"" type freaky stuff. Nobara is the type of girl that inspires such thoughts in me. Mappa made her tok busty and too thicc and you can't even tell me it's all i my head cuz you know Mappa made her rack bigger than she has in the manga. God even just seeing her expression of disgust in that screenshot turns me on so much and makes me cook up a whole story about a salary man in his 30s and highschooler Nobara involving a school ID.

Let's set the scene: Nobara Kugisaki on a train on her way back from Tokyo Metropolitan Technical School in her school uniform and all that. It's 5 pm in the afternoon and train is jam packed with salary men returning home after another shitty corporate day all thanks to Plaza Accord that tanked the Yen all those years ago (damn the Americans!). Now imagine rattling around in a stuffy train, tired from work, and your eyes fall on this busty, gorgeous girl in school uniform scrolling her phone. She got those tits that no amount of modest clothing can hide that jiggle with every rattle of tha train. Her ass under that tight skirt with those birthing hips biologically scream ""I'm ready"". And her dolled up face with those painted lips make and that expression of mild disgust she looks at you has you throbbing already, hoping you don't shoot a splooge harpoon in your pants. It would be like finding a wellspring in a desert. You try to guess if she is in first year or third and for the first time you feel lucky to be japanese (or American depending on the state) as you cheekily shuffle closer. 

Nobara notices you and your obvious aura of a natural Curse magnet that is your average japanese salary man life and asks if there is something you need. You are a salary man entering his 30s returning home, she's a highschooler you ran into on a train, there's a cheap love hotel nearby and this is a tale as old as corporate Japan. You can practically see the litter of used rubbers and discarded uniform like in those hentai. You don't know why this pretty girl keeps looking over your shoulder (remember, you can't see Curses), but you are glad she's taken an interest in you. You might have rarely gotten to speak with your fellow teenage girls back when you were a teenager yourself but at least you are living that fantasy now. You tentatively ask her out for coffee and Nobara gives you that knowing smile that is the sure fire sign of a naughty girl that's getting all the hints and is in mood. You slap yourself to check if this is real and hope the receptionists at the love hotel follow the word of the law instead of the spirit and just ignore the fact that she's wearing the wrong kind of uniform to be renting a love hotel with a salary man.

Flashforward to 8 pm in a cheap love hotel, the springs of the mattress are groaning with strains of a legally sanctioned but eyebrow raising fuck session as Nobara's juicy plump soft bouncy ass jiggles with each desperate thrust you give her from behind, her eyes rolling into the back of her head and her toes curling. Just moments ago she had been giving you head as your balls clapped on her chin. Now her school uniform lays scattered around the bed mixed with your salary man office uniform and your jizz spilling from used condoms littered on the bed. Sight of a panting and gorgeous girl surrounded by discarded school uniform in a dimly lit hotel room is a familiar sight for anyone that reads decent hentai. And Nobara Kugisaki fits perfectly into this scene.

On the bedside table there's an empty packet of condoms, a voodoo doll, nail and a hammer. You aren't sure why she had those on her, nor do you know why she insisted on getting a hair of you and hammering that on a voodoo doll but you feel lighter all of a sudden and even more horny. 

But the thing that made you the hardest was the confirmation. 

Nobara looks back at you and rolls her eyes. ""Creepy old salary men, ughhhh!"", she says between breathless moans as her tits jiggle and her phat ass claps with each plowing thrust. Nobara with her massive tits that seem a little too big for her age thanks to Mappa. Nobara with that dumptruck that calps with move. Nobara and her sexy pretty face with those plump lips that were wrapped so tightly around your shaft. Behind her you hold her hair in a gentle fist in one hand and with the other hand you hold up her school ID. You don't know what the fuck this Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College is (incidentally it kinda ruins the whole salary man and highschooler fantasy cuz they call themselves a college) but none of that matters as your eyes can the Date of Birth section on her ID and your cock throbs with excitement and your hips move even faster. Your eyes scan over the year and you do a simple substraction and just then your balls give out on you and another condom is filled to bursting with Nobara Kugisaki. Nobara pulls the used condom off and ties it's end. She holds the other 10 from the bedside table up to the light and groans. 

""Really Mr, 11?! Right after I showed you my school ID?!"" Nobara pouts. ""Well at least the Curse is gone."" 

You don't know what that means but who gives a shit. You pick up her ID again and give the DoB section another read. Your cock jumps with delight and Nobara groans with an adorable pout again. You are ready for round two. You pull out the calculator and start typing the years in. You want to see the digits displayed on a screen for your own eyes",7,1729493812.0,FreakyKaisen,14,0.89,False

Mind you this story is from what I have seen and exspericed with these people and what I've heard 2nd hand.

For backstory her sister is 4 years younger than her. She has always been bad with money. When we were first dating we got her on our phone plan to help save her some money. Never paid us after the first month. Get tickets to concerts, never seeing that money again.

Well now it's starting to spread around town. So my SIL started working with her aunt for a guy that owns a few businesses around town. It started with her painting houses to her becoming the owners secretary. This man is a good 10+ years older than her mind you.

After a year of them working together she convinces him to open a little coffee shop in our town.

Well after a while this man just ups and leaves his wife and 5 kids for no reason. (That I've been told.) Also he's really into his religion and even ends up leaving the church. So then the coffee shop gets caught up in all the curfuffle. 

This man also co signs a car for my SIL, and helps her get a house through his business. The eldest sister lives with her and her 2 kids. She claims that she is doing no ""favors"" to this guy. She also has a baby daddy who's in the picture, but they are separated for the time being. 

Well the coffee shop opens and is open for literally like 4 months before now the coffee shop gets caught up in everything. They close. Everytime we as when are you gonna open and whatnot she's like oh it won't be long just gotta get some thing in place and everything will be right as rain. She said alot of she's just waiting on a loan to go through.

Come 7 months later.

She starts having issues with her co partner. He starts making advances to her and she says she wants nothing to do with him. Then someone gets her attention about the guy and that's when all hell breaks loose. 

He starts stalking her and constantly coming into the shop even during past closing and wouldnt work just talk and talk to my SIL. She starts finding him really annoying and starts wanting to distant herself from him. 

Come to find out this man had got caught at a school peeping into the girls lockerroom master baiting. Personally idk all the details of that but now my SIL wants NOTHING to do with this man.

She is wrecking this man's life once she found out about this. He has lost all his partners in his other jobs, and now she is taking him to court to get him erased from all paperwork of the coffee shop.

But now we are working on almost a year and there has been no changes and the shop has been closed. No electric now just a husk of a shell of what it used to be. She claims she just waiting for the courts to follow through, but my buddy has pointed out that if it was such an open shut case this would have been taken care of already. 

Now she's prodding my wife on trying to get her to co sign for a car for her and get money out of her to help with the shop. Which mind you I forgot to mention, my wife is a family of 5 and whenever my SIL started opening the shop she asked the help from the eldest and her younger brother. My wife is the 2nd oldest but yea she never once asked my wife to help with the shop up till whenever it came to money.

Now she's living with her baby daddy trying to make things work, and working with him. Come to find out she's wanting to leave him again and claims that he had spent the money that was for her mortgage. That her sister has givin her half of the mortgage. My wife is scared that she is gonna lose her house and her eldest sister is gonna get screwed in the process.

My wife felt really upset whenever this happened wondering why she didn't want any help from her. But now she's kinda like oh this is my chance, but I'm like i want nothing to do with that shop. (Not to mention there's already 3 other places that are coffee shops in our small town). 

So how do I get it through to my wife that her sister is only telling her what she wants to hear. I'm a ferm believer of the whole 2 sides of every story, and I tell my wife she also needs to see whatever her sister isn't telling her. Any advice?

I had no issues doing that and didn‚Äôt even ask for gas money (they never offered anyways) despite driving 50+ km every time we hang out. But these guys have absolutely zero respect for safety and my car. 

I have some basic sets of rules that everyone has to follow; all seat belts must be buckled (at the back too), no eating or drinking (water exception), no messing with my infotainment system, no opening and closing the windows when AC/Heat is on, and no smoking. 

Thing is, none of them follow my rules, they act like total children when they‚Äôre in my car. Constantly complaining about the temperature (I set it to 22 degrees), music, volume, the way I drive etc. They also blatantly break my rules and complain about them.

I‚Äôm sick of driving them around. Owning a car is a big responsibility and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable or safe driving with these people. 

So as of last month I told them I‚Äôm not driving these people around, they‚Äôre banned from ever entering my car, if we hang out, we hang out with public transit, walking, and cycling.

I wasn‚Äôt prepared for this. In fact, I hadn‚Äôt even finished my coffee when I stumbled into the living room, yawning, only to find Benji standing by the window, staring out with his arms crossed. His face was pale, tense, as if he was watching something sinister unfold. His eyes were fixed on the driveway. I glanced over, but all I could see was the top of some sandy blonde hair, barely visible above the back of a foldable red lawn chair.

""He's still out there,"" Benji groaned, not taking his eyes off the scene.

""So?"" I muttered, still groggy and trying to shake off my sleep.

""Dude, he's been sitting there for hours. Every single day! Just... staring. It's not normal.""

I sighed, setting my mug down on the table. ""He comes inside at night, mostly,"" I replied nonchalantly. ""He‚Äôs just a little... odd, that‚Äôs all.""

""Yeah, and when he‚Äôs inside, he stares at me. Like, just sits there and stares. It's creepy as hell. Sometimes he doesn‚Äôt even come in all night. Just stays out there... waiting.""

I shrugged, trying to brush it off. ""Well, he pays his rent. Actually, he paid months in advance.""

Benji turned to me, his expression exasperated. ""I don‚Äôt care if he pays his rent. He freaks me the hell out. And you know what freaks me out even more? He‚Äôs always watching. What is he even watching?""

My eyes wandered back to the driveway. Our strange roommate, Greg, hadn‚Äôt moved in hours, just sitting there like some kind of statue. His head occasionally shifted, following the movement of passing cars, but otherwise, he was eerily still. He didn‚Äôt seem to care that anyone found his behavior odd.

""Look, man,"" I said, rubbing the bridge of my nose. ""We can‚Äôt kick out the one guy who actually pays his bills on time, just because you‚Äôre worried he‚Äôs secretly plotting to measure our skulls while we sleep.""

Benji froze, his eyes widening. ""Wait, what? What did you just say?""

I blinked, realizing what had slipped out. ""Oh... yeah. That reminds me... I woke up the other night and found him, uh, measuring my skull.""

Benji‚Äôs face paled. He slowly turned to face me, disbelief and anger rising in his voice. ""What the hell, dude! That's not normal! Why didn't you say anything before?""

I waved him off. ""Relax, he said he was just collecting data. He‚Äôs a nerd. It‚Äôs probably some research project.""

""Has he measured *my* skull?""

""How would I know that?"" I shrugged. ""Maybe? I didn‚Äôt ask. You think I‚Äôm going to have that conversation?""

Benji‚Äôs frustration was boiling over. ""You should‚Äôve asked him! For all we know, he‚Äôs doing some freaky serial killer stuff while we sleep!""

""Calm down, Benji. He‚Äôs not a serial killer. If he was, don‚Äôt you think he would‚Äôve, you know, led with that in his emails? ‚ÄòHey, looking for roommates, by the way, I have a slight hobby of measuring skulls and collecting data for my murder manifesto?‚Äô""

Benji‚Äôs fists clenched. ""That‚Äôs not funny. What exactly does he do for a living? How did you find this guy?""

""He said he used to work in a lab or something. He‚Äôs harmless. Just weird.""

I noticed Greg had stood up now, swaying slightly, his arms raised like he was gesturing at something. He looked completely unhinged, a far cry from the quiet nerd we thought we knew. And then I saw it‚Äîa small white van pulling into the driveway, its headlights briefly illuminating the dim street.

Benji‚Äôs voice cracked as he stared at the van. ""What kind of lab did he work at?""

""I don‚Äôt know, man. He‚Äôs private. But he did make me a strange offer the other day.""

""What offer?"" Benji asked, his voice laced with panic.

I hesitated. ""He offered to pay your share of the rent.""

Benji shot me a horrified look. ""Why would he do that?""

""I didn‚Äôt ask. I figured it was a nice gesture."" My attempt at humor fell flat as Benji's face grew more and more alarmed.

The white van came to a halt, and a cold chill ran down my spine. Two figures, dressed in dark coats, emerged from the van, moving toward Greg with quick, purposeful steps. I exchanged a nervous glance with Benji.

""Something‚Äôs wrong,"" I muttered, more to myself than to him.

""Yeah, no shit,"" Benji hissed, stepping back from the window.

Greg, who had been completely still until now, suddenly erupted into frantic movement. He started yelling at the two men, his voice muffled by the glass, but his body language screamed desperation. His wild hand gestures, his frantic pacing‚Äîit was like he was pleading with them.

""Okay, this is getting way too weird,"" Benji whispered, backing away from the window.

Before I could respond, there was a loud knock at the front door. Both Benji and I froze, the sound echoing in the stillness of the house. Another knock, louder this time.

""Should we... should we open it?"" Benji stammered, his eyes wide with fear.

""I don‚Äôt know, man. What if it‚Äôs them?"" I whispered back.

Another knock. This time, it was followed by Greg's muffled voice outside, frantic and panicked. ""Guys! Let me in! Please! I need your help!""

I cautiously approached the door, peeking through the peephole. Greg was standing there, drenched in sweat, his face contorted with fear. Behind him, the two men from the van were slowly advancing, their faces obscured by shadows.

""Open the door!"" Greg shouted, banging his fists against the wood. ""Please, they‚Äôre coming for me!""

I hesitated for a moment, then turned the lock and swung the door open. Greg stumbled inside, slamming the door shut behind him, his breathing ragged and uneven.

""They found me,"" he gasped, leaning against the wall, clutching his chest.

""Who found you?"" Benji demanded, his voice trembling.

Greg‚Äôs eyes darted wildly around the room, as if expecting the walls to close in on him. ""The people I worked for. The lab... it wasn‚Äôt just a lab. They did things‚Äîhorrible things.""

""What are you talking about?"" I asked, trying to make sense of his words.

Greg swallowed hard, his eyes wide with terror. ""They experimented on people. On *us.* I was one of the subjects. But I escaped. I‚Äôve been hiding ever since. But they found me.""

Benji and I exchanged a horrified glance. This was way beyond what either of us had expected.

""You... you were a test subject?"" Benji stammered, his face pale.

Greg nodded, wiping sweat from his brow. ""They did things to us. To our minds. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know they‚Äôre still watching. They‚Äôve always been watching.""

The knock on the door came again, more insistent this time. Greg‚Äôs eyes widened in terror, and he backed away from the door, trembling.

""They're here,"" he whispered.

I motioned for Benji to stay quiet, then slowly crept toward the door. My heart was pounding in my chest, each beat echoing louder than the last. I peered through the peephole again. The two men were still there, but they weren‚Äôt knocking anymore. Instead, they were just... standing, staring at the door, their faces hidden in the shadows.

""Greg,"" I whispered, stepping back from the door. ""What do they want?""

Greg shook his head violently. ""I don‚Äôt know. But they‚Äôll kill me. And if you let them in, they‚Äôll kill you too.""

The room seemed to grow colder. Benji was shaking now, his eyes flicking from Greg to me, waiting for some kind of plan.

Suddenly, the men outside began pounding on the door with relentless force, shaking the entire frame. The lights in the room flickered, casting strange, dancing shadows across the walls.

""Benji,"" I hissed. ""Call the cops. Now!""

But before he could even reach for his phone, the pounding stopped. Complete silence. The air felt thick, suffocating.

We waited, tense and frozen. But no more knocks came. No more pounding. Just silence.

I slowly approached the window and peeked through the curtain. The van was gone. So were the men. They had vanished, as if they had never been there at all.

Greg collapsed onto the couch, burying his face in his hands. ""You don‚Äôt understand,"" he whispered. ""They‚Äôll come back. They always come back.""

As his words lingered in the room, Benji and I exchanged a look of shared dread. We weren‚Äôt sure what had just happened, but we knew one thing for certain.

A riot of colors, vivid and bold,
Like life itself, a canvas tossed,
With splashes of chaos, pure joy to behold.

In conversations that twist and coil,
Yet in the chaos, a beauty blossoms,
A harmony of hearts that‚Äôs worth the toil.

The moon, that cheeky little tyke,
Winks at me from the darkened canopy,
""You‚Äôre doing great!"" she seems to say,
As I blunder through daylight‚Äôs absurdity.

My (30M) wife (32F) and I have been married for nearby a year but we've been together for 14 years and have 4 kids.

To make a very long story short, here's a quick breakdown of our current situation:

I'm the primary breadwinner with salary that's 4x hers and I care for most of the household stuff and kids related things.

I need intimacy (all of it) and she seemingly doesn't. She never shows love towards me, it's always I who need to initiate intimacy of any kind.

She goes out nearly every weekend to the club with her friends, even though I've expressed my discomfort and view on it (clubbing is for singles, not a married parent of four). 

Every single morning when she's working she's stressed and angry. I need to drop off the kids at school because of her schedule, so I need to readjust mine.

This past week we've only had 1 car due to a flat tire and the new one on its way. So she'll drop us all off at school and I'll take the bus to the office.

So this naturally stresses her out even more. She gets irritated, says mean things, shouts at me for not thinking of everything while she does nothing.

I'm writing this on the bus to work. This morning she chastised me for not knowing where her rain pants were (she works with dogs outdoors and it's raining) and not thinking of everything for the kids.

What I did this morning was give the kids breakfast, help put clothes on them, take out the dog, prepare my wife's lunch and coffee, change diapers, clean the kitchen and somehow put clothes on myself.

And nevermind I've been up several times this night giving the little one formula.

But my wife decides to call me names, tell me to eff off and be overall mean.

I wrote her a text message telling her that I'm this close now if nothing changes. I said that she can't keep hurting me like this. I said that I'll prepare everything the night before to avoid stress but this behavior has to stop.

I'm just lost. I love her but I can't live like this anymore. Worst part is that I have an open heart surgery coming up so we need to stick together now, but it's just not fun anymore.

Rant over, I'll give more details in the comments if need be.",1,1729491969.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False
1g8j8sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Blogs_Only/comments/1g8j8sl/top_amenities_that_make_luxury_senior_living/,Top Amenities That Make Luxury Senior Living Facilities Feel Like Home,"Retirement is a wonderful phase where one gets to enjoy the fruits of labour after decades of hard work. It involves the transition to a new span of life filled with happiness and opportunities for relaxation.

The place where you get to spend your retired life plays an important role in how you can live your golden years. In recent years, luxury senior living facilities have increased, but for all the good reasons. Earlier, the idea of moving ageing parents or any loved ones to an old-age home was a bit scary or rather had negative perceptions.

However, given the modern changing situation where children are moving away from the cities for better job prospects, keeping the parents in a retirement house is the best option to let them enjoy their years in a safe and comfortable place. 

Over the years, the new-age senior living facilities have changed significantly and they are no less than a second home. Unlike, traditional elderly care homes, which were doomed places, modern retirement homes come with plenty of amenities and services for the residents to enjoy and do the things that they love.

# Here is What Luxurious Retirement Homes are Designed to Feel Like Home

Today‚Äôs senior living housing not only caters to the health and safety of its residents but also fosters independence and creates a true sense of home. Here are the top amenities that these facilities have, thereby offering a life of sophistication and luxury to its residents.

* **Spacious and well-furnished rooms**

One of the significant aspects of modern and premium old-age homes is well-designed and fully furnished rooms. Each unit has an attached balcony with a garden view, ensuite bathrooms with shower cubicles, supporting handles, grab bars & anti-skid flooring. There is also a pantry counter for tea/coffee making, a study table, a wall-mounted TV with cable connection, 24-hour power backup, and free WiFi.

* **Fine dining experience**

A gourmet experience in a premium retirement home goes beyond having standard meals. A luxury senior living facility in Kolkata has AC indoor and outdoor dining halls. The foods are cooked by professional chefs in their in-house kitchen. Within the facility, there is a resort that is just 10 metres away, which also has multi-cuisine restaurants that can be accessed by the residents. The facility understands the dietary precautions of the elders; hence, they serve curated foods according to their needs.

* **Beautiful outdoor spaces**

A key element that makes modern old-age homes different from traditional ones and enhances the lives of senior citizens is allowing them to connect with nature. One can find beautifully designed landscaped gardens with walking pathways and outdoor seating options. This gives a chance to the residents to spend time in the fresh air or stroll under the open sky.

* **Fitness and holistic wellness centres**

Most luxurious senior care living facilities have a yoga and meditation room, a well-equipped gymnasium and a physiotherapy centre, encouraging the residents to have an active lifestyle. They even have a library and mini-theatre so that the elders can spend their leisure time.

* **CCTV cameras in common areas**

Safety and security are of utmost importance in senior living communities. They have CCTV cameras installed in common areas with round-the-clock surveillance by trained staff. There is a receptionist responsible for recording every guest entry. 

* **On-site health care support**

[Elders do not need to worry about their healthcare needs while residing in luxury senior living facilities](https://www.jagritidham.com/). They offer emergency response services. There are resident doctors and nurses, ambulance alerts and a 24\*7 medical care team within the facility.

# Conclusion

With premium amenities, meticulous infrastructure and trained staff, senior living facilities are communities where residents can enjoy calling home and enjoy their golden years to the fullest.

**tldr:** struggling to find the right grind size or V60 recipes with my new ZP6. I get clarity, but I'm missing any sweetness and cant get rid of the tannic taste. I can't return it, so trying to make the best of this grinder without buyer's remorse. \[My coffee set up is listed down at the bottom\]

**Context:** I recently moved out to Japan and bought a new quality grinder for my journey. I wanted to downsize from my Fellow Ode 2 that I had back in the US, but not skimp out on brew or build quality. 

I loved my Ode 2 and its brews and it didn't take me long to get used to dialing it in. I also have been using a Timemore Chestnut C2 for when I was traveling in the states. It overall did not make amazing brews, but was fantastic for my nomadic lifestyle of the past year (and only like $70 at the time of 2022). Once I learned how to do brews with much coarser settings on the C2, I was able to get some FANTASTIC cups on occasion. SO, now that I have ""upgraded"" to a ZP6 (the supposed king of filter), I am very perplexed.

I enthusiastically went for the ZP6 after much research. Good affordable flat bur grinders are hard to come by here in Japan. I wanted something that got me close results to the Ode 2 (conical or flat) and there was tons of positive feedback on the ZP6 online, especially at $200 usd (about 30,000Ôø•). 

But when I finally  got it, my cups were- not great. \[I will list all of my coffee specs and experience below this, so scroll down if you want more info to help me nitpick\] I've worked in coffee for a long time and I have a pretty well trained pallet, but no matter what grind size I've been using, my cups are not coming out as clean and nice as everyone touted. I usually strive for clarity and I like a light body. However, even the slightly more balanced cups I've made have been lacking any sweetness, and--more importantly--quite **tannic**. I've also been a tea lover for even longer than coffee, but despite claiming ""tea like"" cups, I didn't expect TANNIN to be the thing to most resembling tea here (Specifically, I mean the drying sensation you feel on the back of your tongue when drinking a over extracted cup of tea or a glass of red/orange wine).

I've tried fine-grind (3.5-4.5), high-ratio (1:16.6+), and high-extraction all the way to med-coarse (6-7), low-ratio (1:15), low extraction--or some combination of those. I still feel like I'm chasing something unattainable here. Yes, I have set true Zero. Yes, I have disassembled and cleaned. Yes, I have shaken my grounds. Could it be my burs need more seasoning?

I've seen a lot in similar forums about how some people maybe haven't learned what their perception of sweet vs clear or full-bodied vs tea-like is. After years of different coffees and home roasting, I'm fairly sure I like a very light body, high acidity, but a good amount of juiciness or sweetness- depending on the coffee obvi.

In Japan, returns are virtually impossible, and 1Zpresso gave a pretty small window, so looks like I'm stuck with this guy. Granted, I've already gotten some pretty good brews with my C2 (an objectively worse grinder for light roast) prior to getting the ZP6, which makes the learning curve EVEN MORE CONFUSING. 

PLEASE give me advice on some brew ratios, coffee hacks, technique, or if I'm just a lost cause and need to switch to something that produces more fines for sweetness (like the K-ultra).

**Coffee set-up and Experience:**

Grinder; ZP6 (current), Chestnut C2 (backup)

Dripper: V60 or Cafec Flower

Paper: Cafec Abaca

Water: (I live in the mountains, so the tap is quite soft and tasty, and distilled water in large quantity is very hard to come by. So this factor is unfortunately out of my hands)

Temp: 89-96C (working without a temp control kettle for the time being)

Dose: I always do 28-32g for a two cup brew in the morning. I rarely do smaller recipes.

Coffees: usually very light. I'm easing out of aerobics and and heavily processed coffees. I usually avoid florals, but I'm hoping to lean into those with the new ""clarity."" Using lots of Ethiopia's right now after avoiding them for the longest time. Still enjoy very fruity and sweet coffees from all over, many times leaning towards tropical.

Experience in coffee: Barista for 7 years, home roaster or 4 years, commercial roaster for about half a year.

Recipes: My go to is Lance Hendrick's modified 2-pour - 2-3x bloom, full pour in small circles around center. 

I also like a 4-pour recipe - 60-90g bloom, remaining weight divided into 3 separate pours with decreasing agitation (via mellow drip or center pour). Yes, I also base my pouring technique off of Aramse's pouring video

Best results so far is with a recipe I was given by the ppl at Koffee Mameya harujuku for a nice natural ethiopian - 14g in 35g, 35g, 35g, 55g, 50g (I double everything obvi) ZP6 at about 5.7

Choose a day to eat all meals phone""

Some of my own comments:
I have no idea what that last thing means about eating all meals one day ""phone."" The fact that she has to make it a goal to eat before 1PM speaks volumes of laziness about how her days go everyday. She has to make it a goal to eat THREE lousy healthy meals in a WEEK? What the hell kind of crap is she normally eating? Just goes to show what a complete bullshitter she's been everytime she declared how much she loves salads, vegetables, or fruit. Checking out a new coffee shop is ""healthy""? Uh, okay. 

That pick a day for self-care is so beyond laughable. Everyday is ""self-care"" for and all about Alex! And I don't think ""snacks"" is a one day self-care thing if she's writing down having to eat 3 healthy meals in one week as a goal. üòÜ

Given the reasons why she was just in the hospital, 1 glass of water per day is nowhere near enough to make even a slight dent in helping her health. That's like putting a drop of water in the Sahara Desert each day hoping to create a lake. ü§£

I'm guessing that 45 minutes of PT is something a social worker from the hospital set up for a few weeks after Alex was discharged from the hospital because God knows Alex wouldn't take that upon herself to do.

I hope her ""compliment a stranger"" isn't her just going up to someone in a restaurant and telling them their cocktail looks delicious.

I guess doing anything with or for Ari isn't something Alex considers a priority or a goal in helping her [mental] health in any way. Shocking. üôÑ

Yeah, that whole list is so painfully pathetic and laughable for a 30-year-old, and the fact that she posted it to share with the world goes to show, once again, how emotionally and mentally stunted she is because it should be embarrassing for her to admit she wrote this for herself.


P.S. Looks like a hospital invoice under the list.",10,1729491773.0,wheelchairrepunzel,7,1.0,False

When I went to reload the ‚Äúonly appliances‚Äù save file after completing a party and wanting to reset to a blank floor plan, I noticed all the flour/tea/coffee machines were at 50 again. I took all the flour out, and reloaded the ‚Äúonly appliances‚Äù save file, and sure enough it was back at 50. 

Has anyone else noticed this and if so, have you tried doing it with other machines (brewing machines or something like that)?

Her posts are very eerily edited videos of herself. It is scary. She always wears a shirt of her wanting coffee, and many of her videos fit well into the horror and corecore genres. She is frightening and I feel like there could be a lore of sorts behind her videos.
