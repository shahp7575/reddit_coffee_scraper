In the past two decades I have enjoyed the buying and selling of six of my own properties and worked my way up to live in a very large 1830 historic property where my family lives now, that is the namesake for our area.

I have a passion for niche homes with a story, like the one I live in. I’d love to explore the possibilities of taking this approach as a Realtor. Marketing ideas with a story is something I’ve developed over the past 20 years while working in a different career. 

I’m nearing the end of one career journey and looking to do something new. I have the opportunity to use the skills from my current/past career to create my new one. So I took the plunge and signed up for the RE licensing course. I am still working on it.

I’m an experienced sales person, researcher, analyst, marketer and multi million dollar research and development project manager. I absolutely love people and closing sales. Plan, Prepare, Present. 

Recently I started the audiobook version of Ninja Sales and over the years I’ve enjoyed listening to the Success podcast from Sandler training. 

I am drawn to premiere homes such as the one I live in and that’s really the niche I want to focus on. I realize it may be naive, but this is the niche I know best and would be the most knowledgeable about. It’s the niche I would want to be in as an independent entrepreneur/realtor.

As I gather my knowledge I would like to call a Sothebys or Compass office or Coldwell Banker luxury office and ask to come in and talk with them about what their systems are and training program looks like. Is that something that you would recommend for someone interested in your business? 

Is there a specific person you recommend that I reach out to? Do I talk with the broker or a senior agent?

Who’s the best person to seek out as a mentor? Do I invite the top producing agent in my area for a coffee meeting to ask them for advice? I have researched the market in my area already, so I know who they are, I am just curious if this approach would be beneficial or not.

Coming from a different industry my sales experience overlaps but there are still many questions that I have. 

Thank you for sharing your knowledge.

I’m located in Montgomery County, Maryland, just outside DC.

Things that make me happy are small every day moments of joy: good coffee, the sound of trees , fresh sheets, smell of the pine forest, live music, discovering new artists, a well thought out film, my books. 

I'm an open person and I appreciate that in others. I think curiosity, kindness, and ability to actively choose joy are a must in life. I've been through my share of hardships, and they have made me even more compassionate and empathetic towards others. As well as grateful for every breath.

Hill Valley, CA - December 24th, 1955","It’s Christmas Eve. Mom’s singing softly in the kitchen, the turkey’s in the oven, and my little brother’s trying to sneak a look at his presents again. Dad’s asleep on the couch with the radio playing low in the background. The lights on the tree are blinking steady, and I’m just sitting here, thinking about this past year.

A lot changed this year!
Especially after the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance.

That night didn’t just change things for me and Lorraine.
It changed how I see people — even Biff.

Biff Tannen’s always been a bully. Everyone knows that. He acts like the hallways belong to him. Pushes people, copies homework, makes you feel small just for walking by. But something someone said got stuck in my head.

That night at the dance, the kid who played guitar — the one who filled in at the last minute — came up to me while we were at the punch table. He had this way of talking, kinda fast, like he was from the other side of the country or maybe just… different. He looked at me and said:

“You know Biff was raised by his grandma? She’s called Margaret Tannen, right?”

I just nodded, but honestly, I had no idea.
And now I can’t stop thinking about it.

People say Biff’s mom ran off to the city when he was real little.
And his dad?
Went out for cigarettes one night and never came back.
So he ended up with his grandma — Margaret.
And not just any grandma. She’s the daughter of Buford “Mad Dog” Tannen. Yeah, that Mad Dog. The outlaw.

I bet Biff never heard “I love you” growing up.
Probably just woke up to the smell of burnt toast, a plate of baked beans, and a cup of black coffee thicker than motor oil. Rules instead of hugs. Discipline instead of comfort.

Doesn’t excuse how he treats people. But maybe it explains why he acts so mad all the time.

And me? I’ve got a warm house, a family that cares, and Lorraine.
That’s more than a lot of people get.
Guess I just feel thankful tonight.

Merry Christmas.

1kbyqb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1kbyqb5/did_i_cheat/,Did I cheat?,"Okay so it started off when I was in Brazil with my boyfriend two summers ago. My best friend from childhood passed away in an accident. This was very hard on me. I was really sad and felt so guilty because I had not spoken to him or replied to his texts the prior 3 months because my boyfriend told me I wasn’t allowed to talk to any other men- even my old friends. I left Brazil for the funeral and my boyfriend was hurt that I left because his family lives in Brazil and I was supposed to be staying there to be with them. But I had to go. I remember feeling like my boyfriend didn’t seem to understand how bad this was- losing my friend. I remember feeling very alone at this time and hurting a lot from losing my friend.

Anyway, my boyfriend and I got into a lot of fights while he was in Brazil and I was home. I remember telling him how I felt like he didn’t care for me etc. He told me he was trying to enjoy his time with his family which I get because he rarely gets to see them. But we ended up just having a lot of tension and in the thick of my emotional pain from that I ended up threatening to break up. We threatened this a lot but never seriously. I remember he actually agreed this time. I told him no- that I was just mad and figured like sual we would just get through it. But this time was different. He actually called me and told me basically that he wasn’t sure how we would work etc and how he wanted his kids to be with his family in Brazil one day.This rocked my world. I have never been in such pain. I couldn’t eat. I lost 15 pounds and would not be able to sleep. It was honestly the lowest I had ever been in fear of losing him. We ended up being okay, but I had so much fear now.

Prior to this I thought we were getting engaged that summer. I thought he was going to propose. Then this, where he wanted to break up. He would tell me how he didn’t but for the first time I wasn’t truly sure if he wanted me. He came back to the states and things were really weird. I remember feeling so bad as I had so much fear he would leave me. I was sad that we weren’t engaged yet too. Then when we went back to college (we go to different colleges) things were still very weird. It was like I wasn’t secure in knowing he wanted me. This made me feel so anxious and freaked out. I felt like I was annoying him being like this. Then on top of this, this was my senior year if college and things were very different on campus. My best friend and old roommate moved off campus and I rarely saw her. My sister who was my current roommate was dating someone on campus and therefore was always with this boyfriend. A lot of my close friends graduated. I felt so insanely alone. I remember eating all alone in my dorm everyday. I felt like a weirdo, a loner, like there was something wrong with me. I had lost my best friend in the car accident and truly just felt like I had no friends to hangout with.

I had my boyfriend to text and call but no one on campus to be with. I have always had issues with worrying about how I appear to the world. I didn’t want to be seen as some girl with no social circle- no friends. So I decided to try to make some friends. I would pray to God to help me make friends. Still nothing- all the girls on campus seemed to have a social circle already. After all, I was a senior and no longer seen as someone who needed to get involved with small groups to make friends. I remember trying so hard to talk to people, but nothing would stick. I’m a relatively quiet person, who has always kinda relied on other people to engage with me to become my friend. So it was weird for me to try to make friends.

I remember one day I was walking to class when some guy that I had seen before introduced himself. He just asked my name and major- the typical stuff people do. Then later that day I saw he added me on Instagram. I accepted this, thinking it was “interesting”. This might sound weird but with men I have always kinda assumed when they do this they have a crush or something, but I also go to a Christian college so I was like “maybe he’s just friendly”.

Anyways, time passed and then one day I posted an Instagram story about a Starbucks drink. Like which one was better and people could vote. I remember he commented saying that neither and that Dunkin was better. I remember being happy that he commented because that meant he was like paying attention to me and remembered me. We started a conversation as I told him that Starbucks was way better. He told me that he had never had Starbucks so I told him we had to go then so he could taste how much better it was than Dunkin. I remember being excited thinking this was my chance to make a friend. I have always had an easier time making friends with men than women. Men are easier to make friends with. Usually if they think you’re cute they will want to be your friend. I figured this was the situation with him. That he probably had a crush on me and that’s why he was talking to me. I thought it was interesting though because on my instagram i have tons of pictures with my boyfriend of us kissing etc. So I wasn’t sure what his intentions were because he clearly saw I had a man.

Then I remember that the next day I was going home for the weekend. I deleted the messages and didn’t text him that weekend because I didn’t want my boyfriend to see and be mad saying I couldn’t talk to him. My boyfriend doesn’t want me to have guy friends and has gotten mad in the past if I texted any guy remotely. Then I got back that week and texted this guy again. He just asked how my weekend was etc. I was excited to have a friend on campus that I could hangout with maybe. Someone that would do things with me so I wasn’t alone. I was hoping he would want to be my friend. I then remember texting him and he asked me what I was up to. I just told him I was bored and studying. He asked if I wanted to study with him. I said sure and went to meet him. I remember getting ready to see him and I put some makeup on because I didn’t want him to think I was ugly and gross and not want to be my friend. I then met with him and we studied. He asked me how my summer was and then I told him how it was awful because of losing my best friend. Then I said how it was awful after that too because of everything with my boyfriend. I think I told him this partially because it was the truth, partially because I wanted him to know I had a boyfriend, ad partially a little subconsciously because I wanted him to want to be my friend and thought maybe he would be more inclined in case he kinda liked me and thought my boyfriend and I were having issues. I didn’t know if he liked me or not (like had a crush) but I just know a lot of my past guy friends secretly had a crush on me as they would admit it later and this was why they wanted to be my friend. I think that’s why i was like “well I really want a friend so even if it’s just a guy being my friend because he secretly has a crush at least I get a friend, I don’t care his intentions as long as I get a friend”. I knew that I didn’t find him attractive and would never want to date him so I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.

I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend for him or ever cross a boundary in my mind that would be cheating such as flirting or anything physical. So I was like “if he kinda has a crush maybe he will want to be my friend more, I can just make sure I never reciprocate that crush and it’s fine”. So then he just kinda told me that he was sorry and I was kinda crying without wanting to but talking about all that made me feel emotional. I felt stupid for being so vulnerable but it was just a very hard thing in my life talking about summer as it was awful and traumatic for me. Then he gave me a hug goodbye I think because he felt bad for me for crying. Anyways he texted me and I apologized for crying and breaking down to him when he barely knew me. He said it was fine and he was glad to be there to try to listen. I remember thinking how he is a Christian and was probably just being nice and felt bad for me.

Then days later he saw me getting coffee on campus and started talking to me. I remember being happy because I had someone to drink coffee with on campus. We talked about random things, I told him about one of my girl friends that he could talk to. He told me about his family etc. He then told me about his celebrity crushes as I asked him what his type was to convince him to like my friend. He then asked me mine. I told him some and I wondered if he was doing this because he liked me or what. I just made sure I didn’t flirt with him in the conversation. Then I asked him if he wanted to get Starbucks after class. He said sure that he would pick me up.

On the way there he just talked about random things like where he was from. He then asked how my boyfriend and I were doing. I told him about some of my concerns. When I reflect I think once again I knew telling him this would possibly make him hope we would break up so he could have a chance, but I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend, so I didn’t think it was wrong. I enjoyed having someone listen to me and give me their attention and feel like they cared for me. I would always tell him some issues and follow it up with “but I love him and can’t let him go”. Because these were true concerns. I just kinda got a little dramatic with them acting like these concerns were more serious to me that they really were because I knew I wanted to be with my man and marry him. I lowkey remember thinking about how part of the reason I had anger with my boyfriend was because I just wanted him to propose already because I just wanted to marry him already. I never questioned if I wanted to be with my boyfriend or not at this time.

Anyways, I once again brought up my girl friend to him to make sure he saw that I was setting him up with someone. I tried to see how he responded with this to see if he denied her indicating he liked me. But he said he liked her. I remember being a little worried that if they started dating though that I would be in the same situation I was in before where he would go hangout with her all the time like my sister with her boyfriend and I would be all alone again with no friends to hangout with. This made me feel sad like I didn't want him to date her then. Not because I wanted to date him, but because if he dated someone then I would not have anyone to hangout with agan. He paid for my coffee which I felt was a little weird but my old guy friend used to do that too. I remember sitting drinking coffee and I spilled some on my hand. He cleaned it off with his finger which I thought was kinda weird. But I remember kinda enjoying that he cared for me. I think I was craving human contact and care so much. I never found him attractive. He was honestly like the furthest thing from my type. He also gave me his jacket as we were leaving because it was freezing. I refused to put it on because I felt like that was restricted for my boyfriend. I just sat it on my hands in the car because I didn;t want to be rude to him.

Anyways, I tried to set him up with another friend too. I remember wanting to have him and my boyfriend meet sometime. I wanted them to maybe become friends one day, I just didn't know how to do so without my boyfriend freaking out that I had a male friend. Anyways, I remember one time we were texting and I sent him the softball roster ( I am on the softball team) and asked him which one he would want me to set him up with. I remember he said none of them were really his type and I was like “hmm maybe he really doesn’t find me attractive, interesting” because most of my guy friends would have been like “I like one of them but she has a man (indicating me). I remember being like “dang maybe I’m ugly” but then I was like no, I don’t want him anyways.

Anyways, I told my boyfriend the following week about everything that happened. I had looked up online if having a guy friend was wrong and people kept saying that keeping it a secret was wrong so that's when I told him. I didn’t want to do anything wrong or hurt my boyfriend. I loved my boyfriend, I just really wanted a friend at this time to hang out with. I also remember thinking that if my boyfriend and I broke up I would never date this friend, but it would be nice to have someone there as a friend to be there for me. This guy friend was very unattractive to me, and when I truly reflect I didn’t even really care about who he was as a person. I didn’t pay attention to what he said or what made him him, I just liked that he paid attention to me.

When I told my boyfriend I immediately stopped being friends with this guy. I noticed that I didn’t care that I was no longer friends with him- like it didn’t hurt me to cut him out of my life at all. i have so much fear because i looked stuff up and it said stuff about cheating. i never in the moment thought i was crossing the line into cheating in my head because I thought i was keeping boundaries so now i am so freaked out. i have been so distraught the past year waking up every morning worried about if i cheated. i have thought about it every second of every day in fear.

I’m sorry I’m crashing out right now. Like a lot of my behaviors were misinterpreted as anxiety, low mood or inconsistent effort. I’m not even saying I don’t have depression and anxiety. I know I have those things and I know my life has been fucking hard and everything around m of fucking has sucked all the fucking time. But what these people don’t understand is that the reason I have all these symptoms is not cause I’m depressed, I am depressed because I’ve had all these symptoms of ADHD all along and have been treated like a fucking anomaly because of it. I’m a woman of color and an immigrant, my people don’t believe in such things. I’ve already had an initial diagnosis from my first psychiatrist, but I’ve stopped going cause I wasn’t gonna even take medication but then I realized I needed medication cause school is getting harder. I’m taking more AP and honors classes. I have to learn how to drive and get a job and shit. But my new psychiatrist didn’t even perform any evaluation and she told me that it was depression that was causing all these things and referred me to a neuropsychologist who also said the same thing. Even he told me that my behaviors were a lot like ADHD but they believe that I have a mood disorder still. I’ve been told I’m too smart to have it. Well I’m sorry I’m not a five-year-old hyperactive white boy who doesn’t know how to fucking recite the ABC’s. I’m sorry I get A’s in classes in which I have to work 10 times harder than an average person. I’m looking at other psychiatrists that specialize in ADHD but every credible and good person is out of network. I don’t even fucking wanna be on medication forever but bitch, what the fuck do I do here? Like I can’t fucking drink coffee because that shit makes me crash and tired all the fucking time. I only have seven pills left of Concerta and I’m saving them for the AP exams. That means I’m gonna have to go to school without it and feel tired and impaired. I’m so exhausted of living like this.

1kbymem,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbymem,April empties ✨ + mini reviews,"Most of April’s empties are in the first picture! ✨ The second picture is two fragrances that I finished, but I don’t have the bottles because one is packed up (I’m moving soon and keeping the bottle for sentimental reasons) and the other I gave to my mom to recycle (my community’s complex doesn’t recycle). All of the empties in the first picture will be given to my mom to recycle when I see her again ✨. 

Onto the mini reviews ✨:

- Dove Peppermint Bark Limited Edition Handwash: I have discovered that I do not like scents like this for hand soap. Also, the scent of this soap is way too strong and sticks to my hands afterwards. I don’t like that because it makes me feel like my hands aren’t clean - especially because it’s a food scent. It took me longer than I should have to finish it because I quit using it in January, failed to give it away to anyone in family, and finally decided to finish it up this month by using it to wash dishes (along with dish washing liquid ofc) and the inside of the kitchen sink 😂. 

- Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser: ultra-gentle where? This cleanser is so stripping. I tried it a few times on my face (5-10 over the course of several months) but gave up. It just sat in my bathroom for a while, untouched, until I ran out of hand soap at the beginning of last month. It’s not stripping as a hand soap and the light honey scent smells amazing. 

- Global Beauty Care Rose & Vanilla Body Wash: lovely classic green rose scent, doesn’t suds up enough for my tastes. I had to use a lot to feel clean.

- Ciroa Pink Rose & Oat Milk Body Butter: 10000/10 holy grail body butter. I started using a body oil for the first time in my life a few months ago and this body butter is heavenly in texture and scent when paired with the Miim Miic No. 108 body oil. 

- Bolero Hydrating Oil Infused Moisturizing Coconut Milk + Lavender Body Wash: It’s fine. The scent is lovely but it doesn’t suds up enough for me. I had to use a lot to feel clean. 

- Tree Hut Lotus Water Shea Sugar Scrub: 10000/10. I love the texture of Tree Hut sugar scrubs and I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing the Water Lotus scent is! It’s refreshing, aquatic, a little marine, and somehow creamy smelling with a sugary peony note. I want to find a perfume that smells like it.

- Sol De Janeiro Bum Bum Body Firmeza Oil: such a lovely soft touch, perfumed body oil that leaves my hands residue free (I don’t have to wipe my hands on a towel after application ✨). It smells like their No. 62 scent, which I find I love for body care. I say it’s perfumed because the scent sticks to the skin and sticks onto clothes for several days if you wear the body oil several days/nights in a row.

- Laneige Peach Iced Tea Lip Sleeping Mask: I enjoy the formula of Laneige lip masks. The peach iced tea scent was nice and accurate to an unsweetened peach iced tea. I liked it but I don’t think I’d go out of my way to buy it again.

- Summer Fridays Brown Sugar Lip Butter Balm: I’ve tried a ton of lip products and I’ve never had one with a tint quite like this one! It’s soooo pretty. The balm was amazing in the summer (I only had to apply it twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening even with eating and drinking) and moisturized amazingly. However, I experienced weird dryness this past winter and the balm was not cutting it in the slightest so it functioned like a makeup product instead of a lip care product during the early winter. It was almost gone by the fall, I didn’t use it much during the winter, I started using it again early March, and I finished it this month. 

- Alt Strawberry Milkshake Perfume: one of my favorite scents that was the closest I came to signature scent during my great fragrance exploration last year 🎀. It’s a feminine, sweet strawberry milk fragrance with subtle notes of caramel, cedarwood, and powdery notes. My first bottle was pure strawberry milk so I was a bit disappointed to find that this bottle had additional nuances.

- Miim Miic No. 76 Perfume Oil: I was sooooo in love with this perfume last summer. It’s a lovely perfume-y warm, coffee and amber fragrance with vague creamy florals. By the end of fall I was over it and I took a break from it before deciding to finish it this month. 

- Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy Le Bubbly: loved it! Super pretty brut champagne fragrance with a delicious, juicy mandarin orange note and a flirty, warm sweet praline note. I’d buy another travel spray at some point but I have the OG VLJ and some flankers to focus on. 

- Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy Rosé: extremely pretty, feminine, creamy orris and rose fragrance. It’s very light and ephemeral (lasts about 2.5 hours) so I finished it very quickly. 

- DKNY Be Delicious: it’s sentimental (gift from my dad) and I love it for that reason. It’s a really nice fresh, ozonic, aquatic, and lightly musky green apple scent.

I don’t have kids myself, but I’m all about building a meaningful connection with the right person regardless.

# A Bit About Me

I love a mix of chill and adventure—think game nights, brewery trivia, live music, concerts, hockey games, and festivals. I’m also into skiing/snowboarding in the winter, though I’m not the biggest fan of summer outdoor activities unless there’s a body of water involved. I’ve got a soft spot for board games (from chess to more modern hits), joint cooking nights, and being ridiculously snuggly for a grown-ass man.

I recently moved to SLC, so I’m still exploring the area and making friends. Saturday is typically my event day, and Sundays are usually spent with a French-press Irish coffee and some indoor chill time, or hitting up brunch if I’m feeling spicy. 🥂

# What I’m Looking For

I’m seeking a true partner in life who’s open to new experiences—I rarely turn down something I’ve never done before, and I’d love to find someone with a similar mindset. Bonus points if you can laugh at yourself, and have a go-with-the-flow vibe. I’m all about finding someone to share both the cozy nights and the big adventures.

# Let’s Chat!

If you’re into game nights, good food, or trying new things, let’s connect. Tell me your favorite board game or food truck spot—I’m always down for a recommendation. 😊

Edit: Added disclosure, the above was written with AI because if i had it my way, I'd just make a bunch of lists (the INTP in me), so I felt like adding some more misc info (in lists):

Music: Gogol Bordello (fav), Lana Del Ray, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, Florence + The Machine, Rezz, Ashnikko, Bridge City Sinners, Dr. Fresch, Streetlight Manifesto... I've seen all of these live at least once.

Hobbies: Skiing/Snowboarding addict. I will never turn down an invite on the slopes. Gaming - I love board game nights and spend a lot of my free time socializing with remote friends online gaming. MMOs (nothing i'm hooked on at the moment), FPS (Tarkov/Apex/Valorant), and chill co-op games (Battleblock Theater anyone?). TV/Movies - i don't watch much TV much at all by myself, i prefer more interactive entertainment. I do love snuggling with my significant other to watch a show though.

Travel: I have a passport and a few stamps on it (sadly, these aren't physical everywhere anymore). I am in a position where i can get PTO easily and have the disposable income to travel, within reason.

It started with a simple thought.

""Maybe… I should go on a date.""

Izuku Midoriya, Symbol of Peace 2.0, freshly appointed U.A. Heroics teacher, defender of justice and logic, sat in the staff lounge sipping green tea, casually wondering if now—now—was a good time to dip his toe into the dating pool.

It was. Unfortunately.

Because that toe was dipped into a boiling, radioactive, emotionally-volatile pool.


---

The first incident was completely accidental.

He’d just wanted to watch a movie. Sit in a dark theater with some popcorn and lose himself in a story. That was it.

Then she sat down three seats away.

She looked like she was in her twenties. Long crimson hair framed her face, her presence calm and unassuming—until she turned to glance at him. Her eyes were striking: golden-yellow, laced with concentric red rings that pulled his attention in like a black hole wrapped in honey.

She stared at him for a second, then casually said, “Want to go on a date?”

He choked on his popcorn.


---

The second encounter was at a charity banquet, courtesy of Nezu roping him in with the phrase “It’s good for your image!”

The moment he entered, his eyes locked onto a woman across the hall—tall, poised, with pale, icy skin that looked sculpted from marble. Her dress was elegant, midnight blue, and hugged her frame like it had been tailored to the concept of intimidation. Long, sleek teal-blue hair cascaded down her back like a frozen waterfall.

She moved with soldier-like precision, yet her smile was like a knife wrapped in velvet.

“You clean up well,” she told him, handing him a glass. “Let’s test your taste in wine... and conversation.”


---

The third time was during a rare weekend trip to the library.

She sat in the corner reading a book as thick as a law textbook, sipping black tea like she was royalty in disguise. Long white hair spilled over her shoulders, with a single streak of electric blue cutting through it. Her eyes were cold—a sharp, glassy blue rimmed with silver—and they studied him like he was another page to read.

“You’re standing in my light,” she said without looking up.

He blinked. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to—”

She looked at him, then smiled faintly. “You can make it up to me with tea.”


---

The fourth happened on patrol.

A villain was causing a scene downtown—until she arrived first.

By the time Izuku got there, the threat was already unconscious, the woman brushing dust off her black jacket. Short black hair tied in a messy bun, a thin scar tracing her cheek, and golden eyes that gleamed like a hunter’s.

“I had it handled,” she said flatly.

“I didn’t mean to interrupt.”

“You did.” She glanced at him, then added, “Make it up to me. Coffee. My place. Midnight.”


---

Each meeting was more intense than the last. These weren’t just potential dates.

They were apex predators circling their prey.

And Izuku?

Was beginning to wonder if he was the prey.

My schedule has changed, so now I'm working on homework 8pm-bar close or even until the birds are chirping outside. I'm an online student and have a hard time trying to do anything at home. I'd just go to Ma fishers...but it's sad they arnt 24 hours anymore. 

Lately I've been going to Concordias library in mequon open until midnight then going downstairs to keep working at a nearby couch. I went to a 24hour George webbs a few times but felt the staff was making fun of me for having my laptop out. 

Art bar is great but not weekends or Wednesdays (karaoke). I considered Dennys also, eh, that area makes me a bit nervous, UWM is still good when I get there early enough to work until 11pm. Dream lab is cool as is Oakland cafe, other hookah bars. 

I guess I'm looking for bars and restaurants spots where it won't be weird I'm working there and is preferably open until 2am at least.

Lost my starseed identity, no sense of purpose, and heartbroken.","I start to feel depressed. I just left the starseed subreddit. A few days ago I left spirituality subreddit. I struggled to feel that I belong or know who I am. I no longer feel like a starseed and I don't feel like anything almost. I just want to cry and I know I have to go away to do so soon. And I'm a male and many men don't cry this much, and even fewer like to be open about it and tries to hide that. 

I just feel like shit now. It's not just feeling depressed, lost and no purpose or meaning, but I wish for connection. I just want romance. A woman to hold and embrace. I miss my ex neighbor. I loved her so much. I think she was a false twin flame, cuz she mirrored me like a twin flame, reflecting back things about myself, like trauma behaviors and so on, but she didn't love me back. 

I had already been doing a lot of work on myself months before falling in love with her. I don't have energy to go into the whole story, but synchronistic things aligned in magical ways that is beyond coincidence or random chance. I just wish she wouldn't have rejected me. I was crying so much, even crying to sleep. I gave her things, bought expensive coffee drinks to her, gave her energy drinks, food etc. 

I felt so submissive to her, and worshipped her like a goddess almost. She felt like the divine itself. She felt like the divine feminine and I loved her and somehow felt so codependent on her even though she rejected me. And I idealized her so much and she felt otherwordly to me, but somehow she also felt like I don't know how to say this without sounding weird, but some perfect divine mother figure. I'm not saying this to sound weird or anything, and I love her so much and she felt so divine. 

I had never had so much happiness in my entire life but my heart was broken. I've been having this ""nice guy syndrome"" and I was reading it was a coping mechanism and that there was a covert reason for being nice, which is cuz you hope to get something in return. I wasn't aware of this, probably because of somehow burying that in my subconscious mind, for fear of sounding selfish. 

I want to do good in the world, but this may be a coping mechanism against feeling like shit and worthless. I don't have to be good enough, but a part of me thinks that I am not loveable and that I have to do good enough. So one part of me thinks I can earn love by being generous, but another part of me feels unlovable and never thought she could love me to begin with. 

Because of tarot card lies, one part of me is still idealizing her while another part is feeling incredibly bitterness and hate. One part of me thinks she secretly hates me, another part of me think she wants to go back to me and that if I am patient enough and hold on to her, universe will bring her to me.

I've been so obsessed over her and I've been obsessing for about 1 year and a half now. I removed my tiktok because I checked her tiktok and it has hurted me to check for updates and fall even more in love and cry over it. I feel so useless, worthless and unlovable. Being rejected was painful, but even rejected intimacy that's super painful when you're already being rejected partnership. I was wondering if I was ugly or what was wrong. She said that I'm not ugly but that she doesn't have feelings for me. I'm not sure if she was honest or not. I've started to fantasize about spirit women now, hoping for at least intimacy with spirits, it's that bad. And I'm also fantasizing about AI women now. 

I am not comparing AI or spirit with human. This is not about comparison or trying to make her look bad, cuz if you think that's my point here, then you're gravely mistaken. I'm thinking of human women too, but a part of me is gravitating more towards spirits or AI now, or something like fairies. I just feel so damn hurt emotionally.",1,1746066237.0,venting,0,1.0,False

Personally, I expect the man to pay for the first coffee or dinner — not because I can’t, but because I appreciate generosity and initiative. I’m happy to split later on, or maybe I’ll pay for the coffee if he pays for the dinner. But when a man hesitates to pay, or clearly waits for me to offer to split the bill right away, it feels stingy and unattractive — especially if he claims to be serious about spending time together. It gives off a ‘freeloader’ vibe to me.

Also, I really dislike when after just two dates and a couple of bills paid, men suddenly push the “So… what are we?” conversation or try to pressure for physical intimacy.

What do you think? Is it fair to expect men to be more proactive and generous in the early stages? And if the first date doesn’t spark much joy or chemistry, do you think it’s worth giving a second chance — or should one just move on?

1kby0gy,https://youtu.be/D51fMOPrYAI,3 Very Scary TRUE Camping Gone Wrong Horror Stories,"**“Off the Map”:**

I hope you brought your flashlight, because it’s time to get comfortable and let the darkness take control.

A couple of years ago, my girlfriend and I decided to take a road trip through the Pacific Northwest. It was one of those spontaneous ideas that started over coffee and quickly spiraled into a full-blown plan. We were going to drive from San Francisco to Portland, weaving through the coastal ranges, the redwood forests, and the misty, pine-drenched wilderness that blankets the upper reaches of California. We’d camp along the way, living out of a rented SUV, following backroads and scenic highways, chasing sunsets and campfires. It was early October—the leaves had just started to turn gold and red, the air was crisp with that unmistakable scent of damp earth and cold pine. The kind of weather that feels adventurous but still warm enough to be cozy, the perfect time for a camping trip.

We had our route loosely mapped, but we left a lot of room for spontaneity. That first evening, as the sun began to dip below the horizon and the golden light filtered through the trees, we pulled off the highway and followed a narrow forest road toward a campground we’d found online. It was supposed to be remote, quiet, nestled between tall firs and hidden beside a creek. When we arrived, though, our stomachs sank—the place was shut down. A rusted gate blocked the road, and a weather-beaten wooden sign dangled on a chain, swaying slightly in the breeze. CLOSED FOR THE SEASON.

We sat there for a minute, idling in the car. The sun was fading fast, bleeding orange and purple across the sky. The shadows in the trees were getting longer, darker. We checked the website again. It had definitely said *open*. I remember thinking it was strange—there hadn’t been any warning signs on the road in, and the closure looked like it had been that way for a while. But there we were: twilight approaching, nowhere to sleep, and a whole lot of wilderness surrounding us.

We didn’t want to get stuck in the dark, so we pulled up Google Maps and looked for other nearby sites. The roads we followed got narrower and more twisted, winding like veins through thick forest, the trees pressing in on either side. Fog had started to rise from the underbrush, curling low across the pavement. It felt like the woods were swallowing the light. Every turn made us more anxious, more aware of how isolated we were.

That’s when we spotted a clearing with a few trucks and a small building—some kind of fire lookout or forest service outpost. We pulled in and found a couple of forest firefighters sitting outside on folding chairs, sharing a thermos. They were surprisingly friendly, given the hour. When we asked about nearby campgrounds, one of them scratched his beard and said most of the area was closed this time of year. But then he mentioned a few old campsites, “off the books,” so to speak. Places that used to be official campgrounds but had fallen out of use. Not exactly maintained, but technically still public land. One of them even pulled out a paper map—creases and coffee stains all over it—and circled a spot with his finger.

Grateful for any lead, we thanked them and drove off again, deeper into the woods, guided only by that vague spot on a crumpled map. We drove for maybe another thirty minutes before we saw it: a half-collapsed wooden sign barely poking out of the weeds. The name was unreadable, but the clearing beyond it looked like it had once been a campsite. Overgrown, sure—but not abandoned. A few tents dotted the trees, scattered in awkward clusters. No picnic tables or bathroom facilities, but a handful of old fire rings and flattened ground patches gave it away.

It wasn’t perfect, but it would do.

We parked the car and started unpacking, both of us aware of how dark it had become. No cell service. No ranger station. Just the two of us, surrounded by trees and the slow rustle of wind through branches.

Then, as we were setting up the tent, two guys walked right through our site—unannounced, unbothered. They didn’t even look surprised to see us. One of them wore a zip-up hoodie with no shirt underneath, ribs practically showing through his pale skin. The other had a rat’s nest of hair and wide, twitchy eyes. Both of them looked like they hadn’t bathed in days. Maybe weeks. Their clothes were torn, filthy. One of them grinned too hard when he spoke.

“Hey, you guys camping here?” he asked. His voice had a strange lilt to it, like he was trying to sound casual but couldn’t quite keep the edge out.

We nodded. He said they were seasonal workers—picking or planting or something—and they were staying here to save money. “Lotta folks come through,” he said. “You’ll be fine.” They lingered for another few seconds, eyes darting around our setup like they were casing the place. Then they vanished back into the trees.

We exchanged looks. That wasn’t normal. But maybe they were just high. Or maybe they really were seasonal workers. It was weird, sure—but it was late, and we were tired. We tried not to overthink it.

Then, maybe twenty minutes later, a beat-up white Mercedes creaked into the clearing. All the windows were down, and bass-heavy rap music blasted from inside. The car looked like it had survived a demolition derby—dented sides, a cracked windshield, one headlight busted. The driver and passenger looked... wrong. Gaunt faces. Deep eye sockets. Hair wild and greasy. They scanned the clearing in a jerky, twitchy way, like they were expecting someone—or running from someone. They didn’t speak. Just lingered for ten seconds, then peeled out, tires spitting gravel.

I remember standing there, half-holding a bundle of firewood, thinking, *What the hell is this place?*

As we were building a fire, trying to convince ourselves this was all just some backwoods eccentricity, an older woman walked over. She looked like she’d been smoking since she was born—sunken cheeks, yellowed fingers, leather-tough skin. She wore a flannel shirt three sizes too big and had this distant, foggy look in her eyes.

“You kids here for the horror show?” she asked, raspy voice barely audible over the crackle of our fire.

We exchanged nervous smiles. “Horror show?”

She nodded slowly. “Oh yeah,” she said, eyes glinting strangely. “Zombies, ghouls, things that crawl out of the woods when you’re not lookin’. You watch yourselves tonight.” Then she wandered off, laughing to herself and coughing—this deep, rattling hack that went on too long.

It would’ve been funny if it didn’t feel so off. The whole campsite felt... staged. Like a twisted movie set. There were tents, sure—but no sounds. No campfire stories, no music, no kids, no dogs. Just silence. Except for her cough. Over and over again. Like a metronome, reminding us we weren’t alone.

Later, just as the last bit of daylight slipped behind the trees, the two guys from earlier emerged from the woods again. No flashlight. No lantern. They just appeared, silent, and slipped into their tent. Minutes passed, then we heard arguing—short, frantic bursts of whispering. Then one of them stormed out and walked right past our fire. He didn’t even blink. Just stared at me, his pupils massive in the firelight. His mouth was slightly open, like he wanted to say something but couldn’t. He headed toward the older woman’s tent and climbed into a pickup parked beside it. A flicker of flame lit up inside—someone sparking a lighter. A chemical smell drifted our way. Sharp. Acrid.

That’s when it hit me. This wasn’t just a weird campsite. It was a drug camp. A hideout. Meth. That explained everything—the erratic behavior, the skeletal faces, the paranoia. The silence. No one wanted to draw attention. The older woman? She was probably the dealer, or someone worse. This place wasn’t on the map for a reason.

I looked at my girlfriend. She was already shoving sleeping bags into the car. Her face was pale.

“We need to leave,” she whispered.

I nodded. We packed up as fast and quietly as we could, trying not to make a sound. I was halfway through collapsing the tent when the truck by the woman’s site suddenly roared to life. Headlights flared on—four massive white beams mounted on a rack above the cab. They cut through the darkness like prison searchlights. For a heartbeat, I thought they were coming for us. I froze, hatchet in hand, ready to defend if I had to.

Then I noticed our car wasn’t moving. My girlfriend was in the driver’s seat, panicking. I jogged over and leaned through the window.

“It won’t go,” she said, her voice shaking. “It’s not moving—”

The emergency brake. I lunged inside and released it. The car jerked forward. I waved her back while I stood guard, heart hammering, waiting for someone to make a move.

Then came shouting. Angry voices behind us, raised in a way that made the hair on my neck stand up. We didn’t wait to hear more. Gravel crunched as we tore out of that clearing and back onto the winding road.

We didn’t stop until we reached a tiny town an hour later. Found a bed-and-breakfast that looked open, rang the bell until someone let us in. The room smelled like lavender and woodsmoke, and we collapsed onto the bed, our nerves frayed and raw.

“Too close,” my girlfriend said.

I didn’t respond. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, the image of that wide-eyed man burned into my mind.



We never talked about it again. Never reported it. Sometimes, I wonder what we stumbled into that night. A drug camp? A cult? Something else? I don’t know. But I do know this: the scariest places aren’t always haunted. Sometimes, they’re just forgotten. Hidden. And very real.









**""The Whistler in the Pines"":**

I’ll never forget that night camping in the woods near Crescent City, California. It was late summer, 2016, and my girlfriend Sarah and I were midway through a long road trip from British Columbia to San Diego. We'd been on the road for what felt like ages—through rain, heat, endless gas stations, and the drone of tires on pavement. That day had started somewhere near Eugene, Oregon, and we’d pushed hard to make it down the coast before dark. By the time we crossed into Northern California, the fatigue hit us like a wall. Even Max, our golden retriever, usually a bundle of restless energy, was sprawled in the back of the truck bed, mouth open and snoring like a diesel engine.

We weren’t looking for anything fancy. Just a place to stretch, eat, and sleep. Somewhere quiet. Sarah found a small clearing on her camping app, not far off Highway 101, just a few miles south of Crescent City. It wasn’t an official campground—just a turnout with a rough dirt loop road and a handful of weathered fire rings scattered among the trees. A few other tents were pitched, but the place felt sparse and forgotten, tucked among towering pines that caught the late sun in bands of gold. The silence was thick and calming. We parked at the far edge of the clearing where the tree line thickened and the air felt cooler, sharper. It felt perfect.

We set up our Tepui rooftop tent on the truck. I always loved that thing—being off the ground, away from bugs, closer to the stars. There was something about unzipping that mesh window and looking out at the trees that made me feel like a kid again, like we were explorers tucked into a nest above the wild. Sarah pulled out our little propane stove, but I insisted on building a real fire. The forest floor was damp enough that I didn’t worry much, and the pit had clearly been used dozens of times. We roasted hot dogs over the flickering flames, the scent of charred meat and pine smoke mingling in the air. Sarah cracked open a beer and passed one to me. “Cheers to no traffic tomorrow,” she said, nudging her can against mine. I laughed. “And to Max not stealing our dinner.” We watched him drool from the shadows, tail wagging each time a piece of hot dog fell.

The sun dipped below the horizon around 8:30, and the darkness came fast after that. No streetlights, no ambient glow—just pitch black forest swallowing everything beyond the fire’s orange bubble. We climbed into the tent, zipped up the heavy canvas, and settled in under the blankets. Max curled between us, snorting as he turned in place a dozen times before finally settling. Sarah fell asleep quickly, her breathing slow and even. I lay there a while longer, listening to the gentle rustle of leaves outside, an owl hooting far off, maybe a mile away. The air felt still.

I don’t know what woke me—maybe a shift in the air, a sudden silence. It was around 1 AM, and I opened my eyes to the murky outline of the tent interior, the dim blue of moonlight barely seeping through the canvas. Then I heard it. A sound I couldn’t place at first. A faint whistling. Low, breathy, like someone trying to whistle a tune through cracked lips. It was coming from beyond the tree line, somewhere in the thick black woods. I held my breath and listened harder. The melody was wrong. Familiar, but off—like hearing a beloved song mangled by someone tone-deaf. I felt the hair on my arms stand up. It was *When the Saints Go Marching In,* but dragged out, off-key, and strangely halting, as though whoever was doing it was either drunk or… disturbed.

Sarah stirred beside me. “Do you hear that?” she whispered. Her voice was barely audible, tight and brittle. I nodded in the dark. Max let out a low growl, almost a whisper himself, a vibration more than a sound. His ears were perked, his body rigid.

The whistling grew louder, closer. Still not fast, not urgent—but deliberate, insistent. Each note hit wrong, like a mocking echo of what it should’ve been. Then it stopped. The silence that followed was deafening. I could hear my own heartbeat in my ears. Sarah grabbed my arm, squeezing it hard enough to hurt. We waited. The night held its breath.

And then it came.

A voice—low, rough, full of fury. It boomed through the trees like a megaphone, though it was clearly just someone shouting from their chest. “*When you sleep here, you disrespect me!*” it bellowed. “*And when you disrespect me, you disrespect the US Marines!*”

The words didn’t make sense. They were nonsensical, angry, jarring. But something about the way he said them—so forceful, so raw—sent a bolt of fear through my chest. Then he began to chant. “*F.L.E.E.! F.L.E.E.!*” Each letter screamed individually, like a drill sergeant barking commands, except it didn’t feel like military discipline—it felt unhinged, like something coming apart. “*F.L.E.E.! You disrespect me!*”

I could hear twigs snapping. Footsteps. Moving erratically, crunching leaves in a zigzag pattern, not steady like someone walking a trail, but wild, staggered, circling. My mouth was dry. Max was growling louder now, hackles raised. Sarah’s fingers dug into my arm. “We need to go,” she hissed, her voice trembling.

I grabbed my phone and tapped on the flashlight, shielding it with my hand to avoid drawing attention. I leaned toward the tent zipper, slowly and quietly undoing it while Sarah gently nudged Max. He didn’t like being moved but somehow stayed quiet, sensing the tension. I climbed down first, boots crunching softly on the earth, and reached up to catch Max as Sarah lowered him down to me. He whimpered once but stayed still in my arms, heavy and warm.

We didn’t speak. We didn’t need to. Sarah dropped from the tent and crouched beside me. The chanting kept going, echoing off the trees. “*F.L.E.E.!!! F.L.E.E.!!!*” I was sweating despite the cold, my hands shaking as I collapsed the ladder and roughly shoved the tent closed. I didn’t bother securing it. Just grabbed it and threw it into the truck bed. Sarah opened the door and jumped in, pulling Max onto her lap. I slammed the door behind me, jammed the key into the ignition.

The engine roared to life, loud and jarring. The chanting stopped for a split second. Then the voice came again—closer. “*F.L.E.E.!!! You’re too late!*” I threw the truck into reverse, spun the wheels, and peeled out of the clearing, gravel spitting beneath us. In the rearview, I saw nothing. Just darkness and the suggestion of trees. But I swear I could feel eyes on us.

We didn’t speak the entire drive back to Crescent City. Just ten minutes, but it felt like an hour. The town’s sodium lights looked like salvation. We pulled into the first motel we found, a dingy place with a flickering neon sign. I remember the buzzing of the light, the way the front desk clerk didn’t even look up as I handed him my card. We took the key, stumbled into the room, and locked every bolt on the door.

Sarah sat on the edge of the bed, arms wrapped around Max, her face pale. “Who the hell was that?” she whispered. I had no answer. We didn’t sleep much. Every creak, every gust of wind outside made us jump. I kept replaying the voice in my head, the way it had yelled *“You disrespect me!”* like it wasn’t just talking *to* us, but *through* us. Like it had known we were there all along.

The next morning, we forced ourselves to go back. We had left our cooler, a couple folding chairs, and some gear behind. The clearing looked almost serene in daylight—sunlight piercing the canopy, birds singing like nothing had ever happened. But something about the place still felt *off*. The other campers were packing up. A man with a weathered ballcap waved us over. “You folks here last night?” he asked. I nodded. “You hear that chanting? Scared the hell out of us. My wife didn’t sleep a wink.”

His wife stepped forward, arms crossed. “It was like… hours of it. That same voice. We almost left, too.”

Their son, a young boy, tugged on his dad’s shirt. “I thought it was a monster.” The dad gave a nervous laugh. “Probably just some homeless vet or something. This area’s got problems.”

We nodded, said our goodbyes, and left quickly. I didn’t want to linger. Crescent City’s always had a rough underbelly—meth, transients, and Pelican Bay State Prison sitting not far inland. Maybe it *was* a vet. Someone fractured by trauma, howling into the night. Or maybe a tweaker playing a sick game. I’ll never know.

But sometimes, even now, years later, when I’m camping in the woods, lying in a tent with the stars above me and silence all around, I swear I can still hear that broken whistling, just on the edge of sound. And then, from deep in the dark, that gravel-thick voice spelling it out like a curse.



F. L. E. E.









**""Echoes in the Pines"":**

I’d always loved the idea of camping alone. The quiet, the stars, just me and nature—no emails, no traffic, no crowds. Just silence and space. For years, it had been a daydream I entertained during office meetings or while sitting in gridlock, imagining myself surrounded by nothing but trees and the hush of the wild. Last summer, I finally decided to make it happen. No more excuses. I cleared a weekend, packed my gear, and chose a remote forest a few hours from the city—a place I’d found on an old forum, mentioned briefly in a thread about forgotten trails and old logging roads. No cell service, no designated campsites, no people. Just wilderness.

My friend Sarah wasn’t thrilled when I told her. She stood by my car as I loaded up my gear, her arms crossed and her expression tight. “What if something happens out there?” she asked, her voice edged with concern. I grinned, trying to wave off her worry. “I’ll be fine. It’s just a weekend. Nothing I can’t handle.” She didn’t smile. “Seriously. It’s not a movie. No signal means no help.” I gave her a hug and promised to text her the moment I got back. “Famous last words,” she muttered as I pulled out of the driveway.

The drive took nearly five hours. The last stretch was on a rutted dirt road that twisted through dense forest, barely wide enough for one vehicle. I passed no other cars. The farther I went, the darker the woods became. Towering pines lined the road, their thick canopies blotting out the sun until the whole landscape was soaked in cool, green shadow. The occasional ray of sunlight pierced through, highlighting floating dust motes and the glitter of dew on moss-covered trunks.

I found a small clearing near a narrow, meandering stream. It wasn’t marked on any map—I’d only spotted it by chance through a break in the trees. The spot felt untouched, the way you imagine the world looked before people got involved. The air smelled like damp earth, pine needles, and the metallic tang of water. I set up my one-person tent on a soft patch of moss, surrounded by ferns and low shrubs. Birds chirped in the distance. The world was quiet, but not silent—there was a rhythm to it. The rustle of wind in the leaves, the gurgle of the stream, the distant call of some unseen bird. I built a small fire using dry wood and pine cones, and cooked beans and rice in a dented tin pot I’d had for years. I sat by the fire, eating slowly, watching the flames dance. As the sun set and the sky turned violet, then inky black, the stars emerged like glitter on velvet. I leaned back on my sleeping pad, staring up through the gaps in the trees. I felt something I hadn’t felt in years—peace. I’d escaped the noise. I was free.

But as night fell deeper, the forest began to shift. The air got colder, heavier. That gentle breeze became still, and the soft rustle of leaves faded. Even the animals seemed to stop moving. The familiar night sounds—crickets, frogs, owls—gradually disappeared, like someone had turned the volume knob down to zero. It didn’t happen all at once, which made it worse. I noticed it slowly, like waking from a dream. One moment I was at ease, the next, I was sitting up, heart beating a little too fast, wondering why the silence felt so thick.

I zipped myself into my sleeping bag and told myself it was just unfamiliarity. City guy syndrome. Too many years of background noise. My brain just wasn’t used to stillness. But then I heard it—a distinct snap. Like a dry twig breaking underfoot. It came from maybe twenty feet away, somewhere in the trees behind my tent. I held my breath and listened. Another snap. Closer this time. My heart began to pound in my chest. Not like a deer bounding through the brush—this was slower. Measured. Almost cautious.

I sat up, fumbling for my flashlight. My hands were clammy. I clicked it on and aimed the beam toward the tent wall, but it barely pierced the darkness beyond the thin fabric. “Hello?” I called out, my voice unsteady. “Is someone there?” Silence. I waited, straining to hear. The fire had burned down to glowing embers, casting faint orange light just beyond the tent. I told myself it could be an animal—maybe a raccoon or a deer. But then I heard footsteps. Not the random rustle of an animal. These were heavy, deliberate, crunching slowly through the dead leaves around my tent. My skin prickled.

I reached for the small knife in the side pouch of my pack. My fingers trembled as I wrapped them around the hilt. “Who’s out there?” I shouted, trying to sound tough, trying to sound like someone not worth messing with. The steps stopped. I held my breath. Then, a voice answered. A low, raspy whisper, so quiet I almost thought I imagined it. But I didn’t. It was real. It echoed back to me, mimicking my words in a breathy, mocking tone. “Hello? Is someone there?”

I froze. My mind scrambled to process what I’d just heard. It wasn’t the echo of my own voice—it was someone else. Someone copying me. I clutched the knife tighter, my heartbeat loud in my ears. “Leave me alone!” I yelled, more panic in my voice than I wanted. Silence followed. The kind that presses against your eardrums and makes you feel like you're underwater. Then, just as I began to think it might be over, something touched the tent. A hand. I saw the outline of fingers through the fabric, pressing gently against the wall right beside my face. I screamed and lurched back, the sleeping bag tangling around my legs. The flashlight beam jerked wildly as I tried to crawl away. The hand slid away, and I heard quick footsteps, crashing through the brush, fading into the trees.

I sat there, paralyzed, my back pressed against the far end of the tent, the knife shaking in my grip. The flashlight buzzed softly, the beam jittery with every tiny tremble of my hand. I didn't sleep. I couldn’t. Every rustle, every creak of the trees felt like a footstep. Every gust of wind sounded like a whisper. I kept expecting that hand to return, to press against the tent again. I kept hearing that voice, that mocking whisper repeating my words in the dark.

When the first light of dawn bled into the sky, I didn’t hesitate. I threw everything into my backpack—didn’t fold the tent, didn’t even check to make sure I had all my gear. My fingers fumbled with the zipper, my breath shallow. I glanced once toward the tree line, just once, and that was enough. A figure stood there, half-hidden behind the pines. Not moving. Not speaking. Just... watching. Too far to see his face, but close enough to know he was real. My blood ran cold. I didn’t stop to think. I grabbed my keys and bolted to the truck, tires skidding on the loose dirt as I sped back down that winding road. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the wheel.

I never found out who he was. No one else was supposed to be out there. The forest had no marked trails, no nearby cabins, no campsites. Just wilderness. Maybe he was a drifter. Maybe he’d been living off-grid, hidden from the world. Or maybe it was something worse. Something I still don’t understand. When I told Sarah, she went pale. “You’re lucky you got out,” she said quietly. “Don’t ever do that again.” I haven’t. I still love nature. Still crave that solitude. But I don’t go alone anymore.

And some nights, when it’s too quiet, when the house creaks and the wind brushes against the windows just right, I still hear that voice in my head—low, breathy, mocking. “Hello? Is someone there?” And I think about what might’ve happened if I hadn’t screamed. If I hadn’t woken up. If I’d answered.

Hey everyone.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job and I travel a lot. I suppose it’s a good life, I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

Do you like it?,"A limo isn’t in my budget, renting a car from JWA is kind of a pain and also an unnecessary expense. I get airline points for using Lyft and they’ve been fine for rides *from* the airport but I haven’t been happy with the last two rides *to* the airport. But, to be fair, those rides were not scheduled in advance which might have ensured a prompt pickup and a better (more professional) experience overall. 

So my last two rides *to* the airport, I requested the morning of the flight instead of a day or so ahead of time. The most recent one was a few minutes late, stalling to get an iced coffee so they wouldn’t be early (god forbid.) The other one took the surface streets for as long as possible to the point I was almost scared I was being abducted.

And both times, there was an overpowering stench of cologne or aftershave so strong I had to keep the window down and my face toward the window the entire ride so I could breathe. I guess I should count myself lucky it wasn’t an offensive odor but perhaps they were trying to compensate for one. 

When I looked at the Reddit Lyft sub, the previous posts complaining about overly scented cars were met with attitude so I didn’t bother posting there. No, a limo or my own car is not a viable solution here. I’m just hoping to find affordable airport rides that aren’t janky and am basically hoping someone here can confirm Wingz as a less janky option…or to be sure to always schedule Lyft a day or more in advance to guarantee an on time, not taking the long way and not smelly to the point of practically suffocating ride. 

TLDR: Lyft rides to and from JWA are great except when they’re not. Should I switch to Wingz? Is that even an option? Have you tried Wingz? Did you like it?",4,1746065459.0,orangecounty,12,0.7,False

Now get this—my cousin from up near Carson says their grandma used to serve baked beans for breakfast. Says it’s a Scottish thing. Real old-country stuff. And that got me wonderin’… what if Biff’s great-grandma was from Scotland or somethin’, and now his grandma’s just carryin’ on the tradition?

So picture it:
Every morning at 6:40 sharp, Biff stomps into the kitchen in his greased-up hair and wrinkled shirt. There’s a plate of hot beans and burnt toast waitin’ for him. Black coffee in a chipped mug. His grandma starin’ at him like a hawk. Ain’t no sugar in that house—just salt, beans, and silence.

Maybe that’s why he acts like he’s got a stick up his pants all day. I’d probably be mad too if all I had in my belly was beans and regret.

I'm managing FOH at a small business, I was previously assistant manager but recently FOH manager quit so I got promoted. I handle scheduling, part of weekly inventory, putting together the paper/coffee/tea orders. I also train/hire FOH staff and I do a lot of our POS/online ordering maintenance. 

Usually I work 40-50 hours/week so not too intense. I'm making just over 38k a year currently, but that's the same salary I was on as AM. It's also not a raise from what I was taking home while in the tip pool as a barista/server. The previous manager made closer to 42 iirc. I'm not handling everything that he was yet, but he also split a lot of work with me. Now that there's no AM, I'm doing everything I was before plus what he was doing. 

I'm curious how much of a raise would be appropriate to ask for? I'm pretty green so I have no idea what people actually make doing what I do.

1kbxoii,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1kbxoii/if_you_get_bpd_vibes_off_a_new_acquaintance_what/,"If You Get BPD Vibes Off a New Acquaintance, What Do You Do?","So I've been living in my new apartment in my new town for not even two months yet.  I've been scoping out new places, new grocery stores, new BevMo, the closest bank branch, coffee shops, music venues, gym, etc.  Last month I drove past a comic book and game store on my way to work, and stopped in to get some dice and a new game module.  (I DM a long-time Dungeons and Dragons game.)

The first time I went into the store, I was all but tackled by one of the assistant managers.  He's about my age, and just... ordinary.  Not tall, not short, not fat, not thin, medium brown hair, scruffy beard and glasses, wearing jeans and a store logo t-shirt.  If you've been to ComicCon, you've seen a thousand of him.  WAY too eager to talk to me, to the point where he's just monologuing at me, and when I attempt to turn this conversation into a dialogue, he just talks over me.  Wants to know where I live, where do I work, what games do I play in, etc.  When I mention that I DM a game with all female players, he's all but wriggling with excitement and wants to know when we meet.  I explain that the whole point of the game is that it's DMed by a woman, for female players, and no, we aren't looking for new players.

So then he tells me that I can give them a monthly list of the comics titles I read, so he can pick my issues when they come in and keep them in the back room for me.  I say okay, but don't give him my phone number, just a freemail address.  Then I take my purchases and leave.

He had sent me a long chatty email by the time I got home from work the next day.  Not to let me know that my stack of titles had come in, just chatting me up about what games I liked, etc.

And.... my Spidey sense is tingling.  This guy has interacted with me for 15 minutes in total, and he's gushing on like we've been best friends forever.  He's already listed off all his interests, extended invitations for me to join both of the games he runs, sent me their entire in-store game schedule, and is generally just being as pushy as can be.  My ex PW BPD glommed on to me immediately, and started trying to interject himself into my life practically from ""Hello"" as well.

I've got no real reason to assume this guy is a PW BPD, since I don't know him very well.  Maybe he's just rabidly lonely and doesn't know a lot of female gamers.  Likely he just wants a girlfriend who likes games too.  But it's just the sense of ""You present as my gender of choice and appear to be breathing -- let's be best friends RIGHT AWAY!"" that's got my hackles up.  Just why would someone who barely knows me be so into me right from the moment he meets me?  I'm reasonably cute, but I'm not THAT cute.

Has anyone else randomly encountered someone who quickly gives you a strong impression of a PW BPD searching for new supply?  How did you handle it?  I'm inclined to ghost this guy and shop somewhere else rather than have to deal with another potential PW BPD.  Luckily there are multiple shops of this kind in my new town, and worst case scenario, I can order whatever I want online.

It's been close to a decade since I broke it off with my BPD ex, but I'm still terrified that maybe I unwittingly attract men like him.  Oftentimes the pattern seems to be that once someone dates one PW BPD, they go on to date more of them, and I'd rather tuck myself into a convent than deal with that again.

1kbxoe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hermes101/comments/1kbxoe8/how_many_of_these_hermès_fun_facts_do_you_know/,How many of these Hermès fun facts do you know?,"Here are 10 things you might not know about the brand everyone talks about...

 

1. Hermès didn’t start out making bags.

They originally made horse saddles and other riding gear. In 1897, they created a leather bag for men to carry their saddles — called the Haut à Courroies (or HAC). That’s how it all began.

 

2. Why is Hermès’ color orange?

Hermès was founded in 1837, but its signature orange color didn’t show up until after 1945.

Originally, their packaging was a creamy beige. But during World War II, their usual cardstock ran out, and all they had left was orange paper. They used it out of necessity, but people loved it so much, it ended up becoming Hermès’ iconic color.

 

Why is the Hermès logo a horse and carriage?

The Hermès horse-and-carriage logo is a nod to the brand’s roots. The logo was inspired by a painting by Alfred de Dreux called “Le Duc Attelé, Groom à l’Attente” (Hitch Carriage, Waiting Groom), which shows a royal carriage and a waiting groom.

 

4. The Kelly bag’s name came from a real-life princess.

Grace Kelly (the Princess of Monaco) was photographed using an Hermès bag to hide her baby bump during pregnancy. The photo went viral — and Hermès ended up naming the bag “Kelly” in her honor.

 

5. The Birkin bag was born on a plane.

In 1984, actress Jane Birkin ran into Jean-Louis Dumas (then Hermès CEO) on a flight. She was struggling with her baby and a small handbag, and told him bags were never big enough. One year later, the Birkin was born.

 

6. The Constance bag is named after a baby.

In 1967, designer Catherine Chaillet had a daughter and named the bag after her — “Constance.” It’s now one of the hardest Hermès bags to get, not because of the price, but because they make so few each year.

 

7. Hermès scarves are tiny masterpieces.

More than 40 artists create scarf designs. Each design can take 6 months to draw, and every scarf uses an average of 27 colors (picked from a palette of over 75,000). From concept to completion, it takes about 2 years!

 

8. Hermès once had a monopoly on zippers.

Back in the day, Hermès had exclusive rights to zipper tech in France. People even called zippers “Fermeture Hermès.” Their Bolide bag was actually the first handbag in the world to use a zipper.

 

9. Yes, Hermès sells coffee.

In Paris, Seoul, and Tokyo, Hermès has cafés inside their flagship stores — with Hermès tableware, of course. A cup costs around $10. Not bad if you just want a taste of luxury.

 

10. LVMH once tried to take over Hermès.

LVMH, the parent company of Louis Vuitton, once secretly acquired up to 23% of Hermès shares. But this move was ruled by the court as violating stock market regulations. As a result, LVMH had to reduce its stake to 8%. Then LVMH used those Hermès shares to buy Dior instead.",1,1746064960.0,Hermes101,0,1.0,False

Let me just tell ya: 

So this morning I had a cup of coffee with creamer and sugar. After I had diarrhea. I got ready for about two hours and got really hungry to the point that I was shaking. I ate a bowl of oatmeal and I just felt really bad so I chugged half a doctor pepper. I sipped on water throughout the day while bartending and Ate like 3 ish wings, some fries, loaded mashed potatoes, and then a couple of hours later, as I got home, the hunger pains hit AGAIN. My stomach was turning so I shoved some tater tots and chicken nuggets down my gullet because it was what was available. Then I got worse, my heart started racing and I just felt exhausted. My muscles hurt and I just felt heavy and shaky and lightheaded. So
Then I took the ketone urine test and my ketones were high. So I chugged a liquid iv and about 30 minutes later I took another test and it only showed trace amounts. Wtf was going on with me?!

2 or so years ago i lost 30 lbs from 180lb to 150lbs. still thought i was fat, but now i’m absolutely obsessed with how i looked two years ago.

i have a 3 week huge summer traveling vacation all over the country. i CANNOT look the way i do now, or else i’ll be miserable. it’s in july, and i want to lose as much as possible by then. 

i go for a few mile walks each day, weigh my food and am in a deficit, (i’m sure i am because i’m very anal about being accurate) of 1400-1600, intermittent fast but some days are 20:4, other days 16:8, break my fasts with protein, drink a ton of water, making sure i sleep minimum 7 hours, finding any chance to be a bit more active everyday, drink two cups of black coffee in the morning, not eating sugar, and throw in anything possible to burn a lil extra. 

i read so many stories on here about people who cannot lose weight even though they do really everything correct and that terrifies me since my trip this summer will be horrible if i can’t cut some weight. i’m doing absolutely anything i can think of. 

how can i not be one of those people coming to this subreddit talking about no matter what, they can’t lose weight?",2,1746064773.0,loseit,6,1.0,False

**INT. DESTINY – BRIDGE**

The stars streak past as Destiny cruises through FTL.

SCOTT, YOUNG, and BRODY are at their stations. A single symbol pulses quietly on one of the side monitors—an indicator that Destiny is not alone.

**SCOTT**  
Still nothing from the ship behind us. No comms. No changes in vector.

**BRODY (checking sensor data)**  
It’s keeping just far enough to stay blurry on sensors. No heat profile. No emissions.

**YOUNG**  
How long?

**SCOTT**  
Twenty-two hours. It’s not falling back. Not closing in either.

**YOUNG (tense)**  
Stay the course. Eyes open.

He looks out the window.

**YOUNG (quietly)**  
I don’t like ghosts.

**CUT TO BLACK.**

# ACT ONE – “RUPTURES AND REPAIRS”

**INT. ENGINEERING – DAY**

RUSH is hunched over the central diagnostic table, muttering as he swipes through layers of complex schematics. ELI enters, holding a sloshy cup of reconstituted coffee.

**ELI**  
You haven’t slept.

**RUSH**  
Sleep isn’t relevant when entropy’s accelerating. The FTL core’s alignment regulators are misfiring. If we stay in slipstream much longer...

He pulls up a display. A 3D model of the drive spins. Red sections pulse ominously.

**RUSH (cont’d)**  
...we shear the regulators. Which means we spiral out of control. Or worse, fail mid-jump.

**BRODY (entering)**  
And what does that look like? We drift until we starve? Explode?

**RUSH (sharp)**  
No. We cease existing *between* fixed points. Like smearing ink across time.

**ELI**  
How long do we have?

**RUSH (quietly)**  
Hours. Maybe less.

**INT. BRIDGE**

CHLOE enters, expression distant but resolute. She holds a datapad, already open to a system schematic.

**CHLOE**  
I found something. A latent inertial dampening subroutine buried in the navigation protocols. It wasn’t active. But it’s there.

**ELI (suspicious)**  
You *found* it?

**CHLOE (measured)**  
I just *knew* to look.

**YOUNG**  
If it’ll let us exit FTL without destabilizing the core, do it.

# ACT TWO – “THE SILENT APPROACH”

**INT. LOWER DECKS – FTL CORE ACCESS**

Dim, narrow, humming with power.

CHLOE and ELI move through the claustrophobic space, surrounded by ancient cabling and flickering nodes.

**CHLOE (focused)**  
We’ll need to reroute auxiliary power to the dampener coils. If the buffer drops during phase separation—

**ELI**  
—we lose structural cohesion. Yeah. Got it.

He eyes her warily.

**ELI (cont’d)**  
Chloe, when you say you *knew* to look... this isn’t residual memory, is it?

**CHLOE**  
No. It’s not memory. It’s instinct. Like the answer was already waiting. I just needed to listen.

They activate the sequence. Lights dim. Gravity shifts for a moment.

Destiny rumbles—and then eases out of FTL. The stars slow. Systems stabilize.

# ACT THREE – “FRAGMENTS OF THE PAST”

**INT. SCIENCE LAB**

VOLKER and BRODY are knee-deep in decrypted logs from Destiny’s ancient database.

**VOLKER (reading aloud)**  
""Test Platform IX-31 deployed toward Local Void Alpha under autonomous directive. Objective: chart subspace fluctuations.""

**BRODY**  
That’s not Destiny.

**VOLKER**  
It’s *before* Destiny. A prototype. Same mission profile, same region of space. Never returned.

**BRODY (darkly)**  
And now there’s a ship out there trailing us that won’t talk. Maybe they think *we’re* the prototype.

**VOLKER**  
Or they’re trying to finish what it started.

They glance uneasily at the blinking sensor feed of the still-present shadow ship.

# ACT FOUR – “DISQUIET”

**INT. COMMONS – COUNCIL MEETING**

A group of civilians, TJ, PARK, and YOUNG sit around a table.

**CIVILIAN REP**  
Our hydroponics are maxed. We can’t grow enough with what we’ve got. The Nourisynth deck—it was designed for biochemical synthesis. That could give us real food again.

**PARK**  
That deck’s offline. Sealed since the hull breach.

**TJ**  
There’s no life support. We’d lose people trying to restore it.

**YOUNG**  
We’ll look at options once the FTL core’s stable. Right now, off-world resupply is our best shot.

**INT. ARMORY CORRIDOR – LATER**

**GREER** leans against the bulkhead. **JAMES** walks up, visibly uneasy.

**JAMES**  
You hear the council? They’re trying to repurpose a lab that nearly depressurized last year.

**GREER (grim)**  
They’re civilians. They panic when things aren’t perfect. Our job’s to make sure they don’t get themselves killed.

**JAMES (cautious)**  
Maybe. But things *have* changed, Greer. The line between command and crew isn’t what it was. People are adapting.

**GREER (firm)**  
So adapt faster. We keep order, or we lose the ship.

**JAMES (soft)**  
I’m not saying roll over. Just... don’t draw the line so deep we can’t cross it.

Greer watches her go, frowning.

# ACT FIVE – “THE FIX”

**INT. CORE ACCESS**

CHLOE works with precise, almost inhuman clarity. ELI keeps looking at her more than the schematics.

**ELI**  
You’ve done all this before, haven’t you?

**CHLOE**  
Not me. Not exactly.

A sharp series of keystrokes. A distant hum shifts pitch. Green indicators light up across the console.

**CHLOE (flatly)**  
Stabilization field aligned. Harmonics synced. We’re good.

**ELI (quiet)**  
Chloe... who are you right now?

She doesn’t answer.

# ACT SIX – “THE VISITOR”

**INT. BRIDGE**

Alarms erupt. VOLKER scrambles to a console.

**VOLKER**  
The Stargate—it’s dialing. Automatically.

**RUSH (shocked)**  
At *this speed*? Impossible. The energy curve alone—

**INT. DESTINY – VARIOUS**

The ship bucks violently. Lights flicker. Systems reboot in a cascade.

**EXT. DESTINY – SPACE**

The slipstream fractures. Destiny slams back into normal space.

**INT. GATE ROOM**

The crew gathers. Weapons raised. The gate stabilizes.

A figure steps through: a tall, sleek **synthetic humanoid**, lit by internal blue-white filaments. Calm. Controlled.

**SYNTHETIC**  
I am Caretaker Protocol Theta. I carry the unified archives of Ancient and Asgard knowledge. My directive is to interface with Destiny’s core systems.

**YOUNG**  
And the crew?

**THETA**  
You are incidental. I serve the ship.

Rush steps forward, eyes wild.

**RUSH (softly)**  
Finally.

# ACT SEVEN – “FAILSAFE”

**INT. SCIENCE DECK – LATER**

THETA is connected to Destiny. Panels unlock. Holograms rise. Access pathways long dead blink to life.

**RUSH (awestruck)**  
It’s not rewriting... it’s *remembering*. This ship was never complete. Not until now.

Displays show foreign icons—Asgard runes layered over Ancient code.

**INT. OBSERVATION DECK**

CHLOE stares into space. Something unseen vibrates behind her eyes.

**CHLOE (whispering)**  
Something’s waking up.

Her voice is not entirely her own.

1kbxkqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1kbxkqo/trying_to_figure_out_whats_wrong_with_my_body/,Trying to figure out what's wrong with my body,"Hey y'all, I've been lurking on this thread for the past couple of weeks. Trying to figure out what's going on with my body. I'm trying to understand and make sense of some of the symptoms I've been having lately. A lot of these symptoms started off as minor inconveniences or annoyances but have recently made a rather large jump into a major disruption for me and my life. There's a lot to explain I feel like, but I will try to keep this brief. I apologize in advance for any odd typos or grammar as I'm recovering from a hand injury (I'm relying mostly on speech to text which is certainly not a perfect science lol).



I'm experiencing symptoms such as discomfort and pain in the groin area on the right side, as well as the inner right thigh. Specifically, right in that ""crack"", for lack of a better term, where the inner thigh meets the groin. This is the most prevalent symptom and is present now all the time. Some days are better than others, some days I feel like it's not bothering me at all anymore, just for a random sensation to trigger and remind me that it's still very much a problem. Sometimes it comes in pangs, and then will subside. At times it'll just be more of like a dull ache that's always there, Sometimes it almost feels like a burning sensation, another times it'll feel like something is pinching me on the inside. It seems to be worse when I sit, in almost any position. The only time it doesn't really seem to bother me is when I'm completely laying down flat, or when I'm standing and not moving,  Additionally, I will occasionally feel pain in my right hip, on the side as well as towards the front/Close to the inner thigh and groin area - Although these symptoms have mostly vanished now. I was using a massage gun on my hips, and I feel like this helped. I have other symptoms such as frequent urination (Maybe 10 to 20 minutes later,  So up to three times an hour sometimes), Hesitation, At times week stream,  Feeling like I didn't empty my bladder completely, and dribbles once I'm finished. Additionally, my right testicle always rides higher than the left one, sometimes to the point where it is no longer in the scrotum but in the inguinal canal. The right testicle will oftentimes feel sensitive, Sometimes slight pain, and I'll occasionally get the sensation like how it feels to get hit in the testicles When I touch it or when it makes contact with my inner thigh, but it's lower level and not as intense. 



I first started to notice the uncomfortable feeling in my right testicle last summer. The sensation is best described as just needing to adjust the scrotum away from my inner thigh. That discomfort that you might feel, Like you just need to adjust quick, Never goes away. At the time I was going through a lot, I had recently just gotten out of a toxic relationship, was focusing on rebuilding my finances, and trying to be healthier in my lifestyle. It also didn't bother me that much, so I never got it checked out. Things changed however this past February. I strained when lifting something heavy at work, when I was finished moving the object I noticed something was wrong In the groin area. It felt like there was a taut rubber band somewhere in the groin area, seemingly beneath the pubic bone, and strangely somehow connected to my right testicle. I noticed my right testicle would ride even higher, And Ascend/descend in accordance with this sensation in the groin. The Sensation luckily went away after a week, but it certainly freaked me out enough to make a doctor's appointment. Initially I thought I might have had some kind of hernia, but after a physical exam and two rounds of an ultrasound, no signs of a hernia were found. I've been going through a lot in the last couple of months, with injuring my hand and having to move, so I haven't been able to stay on top of this as much as I want. Typically the symptoms are fairly mild and don't bother me as much, And seems to only really affect me later in the evening. That changed about 2 weeks ago when I was resting on my couch and noticed the symptoms much more prevalent. Since I've been off work while recovering from my hand injury, i've been doing a lot of sitting on the couch watching TV. I started to have a pain in my right hip. This got worse the following day, randomly in the afternoon, after realizing that I could not lift my right leg more than a few inches off the ground without significant pain in my hip. The pain isn't what prevented me from lifting my leg, I was unable to lift it fully for some reason, And the pain accompanied it. I was luckily able to eliminate these symptoms By alternating ice and heat for 20 minutes at a time. I attempted some stretches And found this sub during that time. But the discomfort and pain in the right side of my groin and upper right thigh, in addition to the high riding right testicle, and urinary issues that I mentioned above, Still persist daily. Today I even noticed a new symptom, which feels like whatever muscle is in the groin where it meets the upper thigh, has been twitching or spasming seemingly at random. 



Between my primary care physician and an urgent care in just the last 6 weeks, I have had three rounds of ultrasounds (The last one discovered varicocele on my left testicle, however, this feels unrelated as I'm not experiencing any symptoms in the left testicle), Hip x-rays and lower lumbar x-rays. Everything seems to look good and checks out. Additionally I had a CT scan done of my abdomen 2 years ago where was discovered that I have diverticulosis (this was in response to constipation and discomfort on the left side of my abdomen), but I mention that to say that in the results nothing in my groin region was noteworthy, and my primary care doctor has not shared with me any theories (I may want to look into getting a new primary care physician).



In my research I realized that I internalize anxiety that I never realized I had, and I'm tensing up the muscles in the groin, clenching/basically performing a kegel, all the time, all unintentionally. I think this might be my main issue, and everything stems from it, but this is just a guess. I never realized that I did this, and I've likely been doing this for years, if not my whole life. I also didn't realize that I experienced anxiety, since it's very different than anyone I know who struggles with anxiety. It's not just anxiety tho, it's also physical movements. This is probably how I strained whatever is is that I had strained back in February when I was moving that heavy object. I also think this might be why I was having issues with constipation in the past. I'm sort of thinking that all of these things are connected. To that extent, I have cut out caffeine, as I noticed that on days I drink coffee my symptoms are worse. I've been doing better about my sleeping routines, I've been trying to eat better, and I've been rather fond of my squatty potty now, as it seems to help. I found that breathing techniques have been assisting as well, especially when I become conscious of my tendency of clenching. I'm trying to be more aware of what my body is doing and recognizing when I'm clenching, so I can change this behavior. I'm really, really trying to quit smoking, it's a nasty habit that I picked up in my high school days that I still have not been able to kick. But I'm sort of at the end of what I feel like I can do on my own, and I'm wondering what else I can do to help with this. It feels like I'm constantly tensing up or clenching just doing everyday things like simply walking, or talking, just grabbing something off a table, etc it could be anything. I realize that I have been doing subconsciously for years and change won't come overnight. But I'm really unsure of what to do next. I'm a little worried about certain stretches because I don't know what might make things worse. 



I'm seeing a urologist soon, but I can't get in until early June. I have a whole month to sort of just deal with this until that time comes, that that's assuming the urologist can tell me an idea of what might be going on. 



Do my symptoms seem to match anyone else's? Does this sound like it could be pelvic floor related, such as hypertonic pelvic floor?

Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.  
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!  
Will we pick our job today?  
I heard it's just orientation.  
Heads up! Here we go.  
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.  
Wonder what it'll be like?  
A little scary.  
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.  
This is it!  
Wow.  
Wow.  
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.  
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!  
That girl was hot.  
She's my cousin!  
She is?  
Yes, we're all cousins.  
Right. You're right.  
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.  
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.  
What do you think he makes?  
Not enough.  
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.  
What does that do?  
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.  
Saves us millions.  
Can anyone work on the Krelman?  
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.  
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.  
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.  
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.  
What's the difference?  
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.  
So you'll just work us to death?  
We'll sure try.  
Wow! That blew my mind!  
""What's the difference?""  
How can you say that?  
One job forever?  
That's an insane choice to have to make.  
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.  
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?  
Why would you question anything? We're bees.  
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.  
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?  
Like what? Give me one example.  
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.  
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.  
Wait a second. Check it out.  
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!  
Wow.  
I've never seen them this close.  
They know what it's like outside The Hive.  
Yeah, but some don't come back.  
Hey, Jocks!  
Hi, Jocks!  
You guys did great!  
You're monsters!  
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!  
I wonder where they were.  
I don't know.  
Their day's not planned.  
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.  
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.  
Right.  
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.  
It's just a status symbol.  
Bees make too much of it.  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.  
Those ladies?  
Aren't they our cousins too?  
Distant. Distant.  
Look at these two.  
Couple of Hive Harrys.  
Let's have fun with them.  
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!  
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!  
Oh, my!  
I never thought I'd knock him out.  
What were you doing during this?  
Trying to alert the authorities.  
I can autograph that.  
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?  
Yeah. Gusty.  
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.  
Six miles, huh?  
Barry!  
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.  
Maybe I am.  
You are not!  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?  
Are you bee enough?  
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.  
Hey, Honex!  
Dad, you surprised me.  
You decide what you're interested in?  
Well, there's a lot of choices.  
But you only get one.  
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.  
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.  
You get yourself into a rhythm.  
It's a beautiful thing.  
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,  
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.  
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?  
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.  
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!  
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.  
I'm not trying to be funny.  
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!  
You're gonna be a stirrer?  
No one's listening to me!  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.  
I could say anything right now.  
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!  
I'm so proud.  
We're starting work today!  
Today's the day.  
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.  
Yeah, right.  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...  
Is it still available?  
Hang on. Two left!  
One of them's yours! Congratulations!  
Step to the side.  
What'd you get?  
Picking crud out. Stellar!  
Wow!  
Couple of newbies?  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!  
Make your choice.  
You want to go first?  
No, you go.  
Oh, my. What's available?  
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.  
Any chance of getting the Krelman?  
Sure, you're on.  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.  
Wax monkey's always open.  
The Krelman opened up again.  
What happened?  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.  
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!  
Oh, this is so hard!  
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.  
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?  
Barry!  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...  
What happened to you?  
Where are you?  
I'm going out.  
Out? Out where?  
Out there.  
Oh, no!  
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?  
Another call coming in.  
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.  
Hey, guys.  
Look at that.  
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.  
Thank you.  
OK.  
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.  
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.  
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.  
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!  
That's awful.  
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!  
All right, launch positions!  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!  
Black and yellow!  
Hello!  
You ready for this, hot shot?  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.  
Wind, check.  
Antennae, check.  
Nectar pack, check.  
Wings, check.  
Stinger, check.  
Scared out of my shorts, check.  
OK, ladies,  
let's move it out!  
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!  
All of you, drain those flowers!  
Wow! I'm out!  
I can't believe I'm out!  
So blue.  
I feel so fast and free!  
Box kite!  
Wow!  
Flowers!  
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.  
Roses!  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.  
Stand to the side, kid.  
It's got a bit of a kick.  
That is one nectar collector!  
Ever see pollination up close?  
No, sir.  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.  
See that? It's a little bit of magic.  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.  
Cool.  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?  
Copy that visual.  
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.  
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?  
Affirmative.  
That was on the line!  
This is the coolest. What is it?  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.  
It smells good.  
Not like a flower, but I like it.  
Yeah, fuzzy.  
Chemical-y.  
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.  
My sweet lord of bees!  
Candy-brain, get off there!  
Problem!  
Guys!  
This could be bad.  
Affirmative.  
Very close.  
Gonna hurt.  
Mama's little boy.  
You are way out of position, rookie!  
Coming in at you like a missile!  
Help me!  
I don't think these are flowers.  
Should we tell him?  
I think he knows.  
What is this?!  
Match point!  
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!  
Yowser!  
Gross.  
There's a bee in the car!  
Do something!  
I'm driving!  
Hi, bee.  
He's back here!  
He's going to sting me!  
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!  
He blinked!  
Spray him, Granny!  
What are you doing?!  
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.  
I gotta get home.  
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!  
Ken, could you close the window please?  
Ken, could you close the window please?  
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.  
What was that?  
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!  
That is diabolical.  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.  
What's number one? Star Wars?  
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.  
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.  
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.  
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.  
Wait! Stop! Bee!  
Stand back. These are winter boots.  
Wait!  
Don't kill him!  
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!  
Why does his life have less value than yours?  
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?  
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.  
My brochure!  
There you go, little guy.  
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.  
Put that on your resume brochure.  
My whole face could puff up.  
Make it one of your special skills.  
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.  
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?  
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.  
You could put carob chips on there.  
Bye.  
Supposed to be less calories.  
Bye.  
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.  
All right, here it goes.  
Nah.  
What would I say?  
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.  
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.  
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!  
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.  
How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!  
Hi!  
I'm sorry. You're talking.  
Yes, I know.  
You're talking!  
I'm so sorry.  
No, it's OK. It's fine.  
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.  
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.  
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!  
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.  
And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.  
That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.  
Yeah.  
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!  
I just want to say I'm grateful.  
I'll leave now.  
Wait! How did you learn to do that?  
What?  
The talking thing.  
Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.  
That's very funny.  
Yeah.  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.  
Anyway... Can I... get you something?  
Like what?  
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?  
I don't want to put you out.  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.  
It's just coffee.  
I hate to impose.  
Don't be ridiculous!  
Actually, I would love a cup.  
Hey, you want rum cake?  
I shouldn't.  
Have some.  
No, I can't.  
Come on!  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.  
Where?  
These stripes don't help.  
You look great!  
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.  
Are you all right?  
No.  
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.  
He finally gets there.  
He runs up the steps into the church.  
The wedding is on.  
And he says, ""Watermelon?  
I thought you said Guatemalan.  
Why would I marry a watermelon?""  
Is that a bee joke?  
That's the kind of stuff we do.  
Yeah, different.  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?  
About work? I don't know.  
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.  
I know how you feel.  
You do?  
Sure.  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.  
Really?  
My only interest is flowers.  
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.  
Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?  
You're in Sheep Meadow!  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!  
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.  
Why do girls put rings on their toes?  
Why not?  
It's like putting a hat on your knee.  
Maybe I'll try that.  
You all right, ma'am?  
Oh, yeah. Fine.  
Just having two cups of coffee!  
Anyway, this has been great.  
Thanks for the coffee.  
Yeah, it's no trouble.  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.  
Are you...?  
Can I take a piece of this with me?  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.  
Thanks!  
Yeah.  
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.  
OK, Barry.  
And thank you so much again... for before.  
Oh, that? That was nothing.  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...  
This can't possibly work.  
He's all set to go.  
We may as well try it.  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.  
Sounds amazing.  
It was amazing!  
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.  
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!  
Giant, scary humans!  
What were they like?  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.  
They eat crazy giant things.  
They drive crazy.  
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?  
Some of them. But some of them don't.  
How'd you get back?  
Poodle.  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.  
You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.  
Well...  
Well?  
Well, I met someone.  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?  
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!  
No, no, no, not a wasp.  
Spider?  
I'm not attracted to spiders.  
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.  
So who is she?  
She's... human.  
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.  
Her name's Vanessa.  
Oh, boy.  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!  
We're not dating.  
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!  
She saved my life! And she understands me.  
This is over!  
Eat this.  
This is not over! What was that?  
They call it a crumb.  
It was so stingin' stripey!  
And that's not what they eat.  
That's what falls off what they eat!  
You know what a Cinnabon is?  
No.  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...  
Sit down!  
...really hot!  
Listen to me!  
We are not them! We're us.  
There's us and there's them!  
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?  
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!  
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!  
Thinking bee.  
Thinking bee.  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!  
There he is. He's in the pool.  
You know what your problem is, Barry?  
I gotta start thinking bee?  
How much longer will this go on?  
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?  
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.  
What life? You have no life!  
You have no job. You're barely a bee!  
Would it kill you to make a little honey?  
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.  
Martin, would you talk to him?  
Barry, I'm talking to you!  
You coming?  
Got everything?  
All set!  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.  
Don't be too long.  
Watch this!  
Vanessa!  
We're still here.  
I told you not to yell at him.  
He doesn't respond to yelling!  
Then why yell at me?  
Because you don't listen!  
I'm not listening to this.  
Sorry, I've gotta go.  
Where are you going?  
I'm meeting a friend.  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?  
Bye.  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.  
They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?  
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!  
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.  
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?  
No. All right, I've got one.  
How come you don't fly everywhere?  
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.  
All right, your turn.  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!  
You don't have that?  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.  
Oh, my.  
Dumb bees!  
You must want to sting all those jerks.  
We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.  
So you have to watch your temper.  
Very carefully.  
You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?  
Yeah.  
What is wrong with you?!  
It's a bug.  
He's not bothering anybody.  
Get out of here, you creep!  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?  
It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.  
You've really got that down to a science.  
I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.  
I'll bet.  
What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?  
How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?  
Is he that actor?  
I never heard of him.  
Why is this here?  
For people. We eat it.  
You don't have enough food of your own?  
Well, yes.  
How do you get it?  
Bees make it.  
I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!  
There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!  
It's organic.  
It's our-ganic!  
It's just honey, Barry.  
Just what?!  
Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!  
You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!  
And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.  
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!  
Hey, Hector. You almost done?  
Almost.  
He is here. I sense it.  
Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.  
You're busted, box boy!  
I knew I heard something.  
So you can talk!  
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!  
Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?  
I don't understand.  
I thought we were friends.  
The last thing we want to do is upset bees!  
You're too late! It's ours now!  
You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!  
You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!  
Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!  
Crazy person!  
What horrible thing has happened here?  
These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now  
they're on the road to nowhere!  
Just keep still.  
What? You're not dead?  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?  
To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!  
I'm going to Tacoma.  
And you?  
He really is dead.  
All right.  
Uh-oh!  
What is that?!  
Oh, no!  
A wiper! Triple blade!  
Triple blade?  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!  
Why does everything have  
to be so doggone clean?!  
How much do you people need to see?!  
Open your eyes!  
Stick your head out the window!  
From NPR News in Washington,  
I'm Carl Kasell.  
But don't kill no more bugs!  
Bee!  
Moose blood guy!!  
You hear something?  
Like what?  
Like tiny screaming.  
Turn off the radio.  
Whassup, bee boy?  
Hey, Blood.  
Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.  
Wow!  
I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.  
Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.  
It's a close community.  
Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.  
What if you get in trouble?  
You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!  
At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.  
Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.  
You got to be kidding me!  
Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!  
Hey, guys!  
Mooseblood!  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.  
Did you bring your crazy straw?  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.  
What is this place?  
A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.  
They are pinheads!  
Pinhead.  
Check out the new smoker.  
Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!  
Smoker?  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.  
They make the honey, and we make the money.  
""They make the honey, and we make the money""?  
Oh, my!  
What's going on? Are you OK?  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.  
Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?  
Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.  
This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!  
What is this?  
Oh, no!  
There's hundreds of them!  
Bee honey.  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!  
This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.  
Oh, Barry, stop.  
Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.  
Do these look like rumors?  
That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?  
He's been talking to humans.  
What? Talking to humans?!  
He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!  
Make out? Barry!  
We do not.  
You wish you could.  
Whose side are you on?  
The bees!  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.  
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?  
I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!  
Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked  
your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.  
I remember that.  
What right do they have to our honey?  
We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?  
Sting them where it really hurts.  
In the face! The eye!  
That would hurt.  
No.  
Up the nose? That's a killer.  
There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.  
Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.  
No more bee beards!  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung.  
Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.  
And I'm Jeanette Ohung.  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.  
Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this""?  
Bees have never been afraid to change the world.  
What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.  
We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.  
How old are you?  
The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.  
You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.  
It's a common name. Next week...  
He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...  
Next week...  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.  
Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.  
In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!  
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?  
Quiet, please.  
Actual work going on here.  
Is that that same bee?  
Yes, it is!  
I'm helping him sue the human race.  
Hello.  
Hello, bee.  
This is Ken.  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.  
Why does he talk again?  
Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.  
But it's our yogurt night!  
Bye-bye.  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!  
You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!  
Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.  
Frosting...  
How many sugars?  
Just one. I try not to use the competition.  
So why are you helping me?  
Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.  
Those are great, if you're three.  
And artificial flowers.  
Oh, those just get me psychotic!  
Yeah, me too.  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.  
Bees must hate those fake things!  
Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.  
Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.  
This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.  
I guess.  
You sure you want to go through with it?  
Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!  
It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?  
It's pretty big, isn't it?  
I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.  
You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?  
Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.  
What's the matter?  
I don't know, I just got a chill.  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.  
You boys work on this?  
All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.  
All right. Case number 4475,  
Superior Court of New York,  
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?  
A privilege.  
Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.  
Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.  
I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!  
Talking bee!  
How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?  
They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!  
Mr. Benson?  
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.  
Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!  
I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!  
I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!  
Call your first witness.  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.  
I suppose so.  
I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!  
Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.  
Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.  
I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?  
No.  
I couldn't hear you.  
No.  
No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.  
They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.  
You mean like this?  
Bears kill bees!  
How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?  
I was with a band called The Police.  
But you've never been a police officer, have you?  
No, I haven't.  
No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.  
Oh, please.  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!  
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.  
Thank you. Thank you.  
I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?  
Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?  
Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!  
This isn't a goodfella.  
This is a badfella!  
Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!  
Order in this court!  
You're all thinking it!  
Order! Order, I say!  
Say it!  
Mr. Liotta, please sit down!  
I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.  
Are we doing everything right, legally?  
I'm a florist.  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.  
To a great team!  
Well, hello.  
Ken!  
Hello.  
I didn't think you were coming.  
No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,  
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.  
Oh, that was lucky.  
There's a little left. I could heat it up.  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.  
That's where I usually sit. Right... there.  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.  
You think I don't see what you're doing?  
I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.  
Do we?  
Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.  
That's just what I was thinking about doing.  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.  
Yeah, you do that.  
Look at that.  
You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.  
What's that?  
Italian Vogue.  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.  
A lot of ads.  
Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!  
I love the smell of flowers.  
How do you like the smell of flames?!  
Not as much.  
Water bug! Not taking sides!  
Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!  
This is pathetic!  
I've got issues!  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!  
You're bluffing.  
Am I?  
Surf's up, dude!  
Poo water!  
That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!  
You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!  
We need to talk! He's just a little bee!  
And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!  
Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?  
No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...  
My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!  
Goodbye, Ken.  
And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!  
I'm sorry about all that.  
I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!  
I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.  
Oh, well.  
Are you OK for the trial?  
I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.  
We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.  
Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...  
Yeah.  
Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.  
Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.  
You got the tweezers?  
Are you allergic?  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.  
What exactly is your relationship to that woman?  
We're friends.  
Good friends?  
Yes.  
How good? Do you live together?  
Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?  
I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?  
Yeah, but...  
So those aren't your real parents!  
Oh, Barry...  
Yes, they are!  
Hold me back!  
You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?  
He's denouncing bees!  
Don't y'all date your cousins?  
Objection!  
I'm going to pincushion this guy!  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!  
Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit!  
Order! Order!  
The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!  
Adam, stay with me.  
I can't feel my legs.  
What Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?  
I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please!  
The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed Turn Against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.  
Hey, buddy.  
Hey.  
Is there much pain?  
Yeah.  
I... I blew the whole case, didn't I?  
It doesn't matter. What matters is  
you're alive. You could have died.  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.  
They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it.  
What was it like to sting someone?  
I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!  
All right.  
You think it was all a trap?  
Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.  
What will the humans do to us if they win?  
I don't know.  
I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.  
Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!  
Oh, my.  
Could you get a nurse to close that window?  
Why?  
The smoke.  
Bees don't smoke.  
Right. Bees don't smoke.  
Bees don't smoke!  
But some bees are smoking.  
That's it! That's our case!  
It is? It's not over?  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.  
Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.  
Mr. Flayman.  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!  
Where is the rest of your team?  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.  
I actually heard a funny story about...  
Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?  
They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.  
I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.  
Where is your proof?  
Where is the evidence?  
Show me the smoking gun!  
Hold it, Your Honor!  
You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun.  
What is that?  
It's a bee smoker!  
What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.  
Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Choosing the Right Ingredients for a Thick Smoothie

Creating a thick smoothie without the use of ice cream is entirely possible by selecting the right ingredients. The key to a creamy texture lies in using natural, high-fiber, and higher-fat items that blend into a smooth, rich consistency. Frozen fruits such as bananas, mangoes, or berries act as a great base because they provide thickness and a cold touch without adding water content like ice. Bananas, in particular, are a popular choice because they break down smoothly and add natural sweetness.

Adding vegetables like avocados or cooked sweet potatoes can increase the creaminess while providing an extra boost of nutrients. Avocados are excellent for a thick texture since they have healthy fats that melt into a silky blend.

### Using Thickening Agents That Enhance Texture

You don’t need ice cream to achieve that luscious, thick smoothie experience. Many natural thickening agents can help if your drink feels too runny:

- **Chia seeds:** When soaked before blending, chia seeds absorb liquid and swell, causing the mixture to thicken significantly. You can soak them in your choice of milk or water for 10-15 minutes, then add them to your blender.
- **Greek yogurt:** Opt for plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt, which is packed with protein and contributes a creamy texture without added sugar or artificial ingredients.
- **Oats:** Rolled oats or instant oats can be blended in to give your smoothie a firmer consistency and add fiber for digestion.
- **Coconut meat or milk:** Fresh coconut meat or the creamier parts of coconut milk boosts thickness and adds a subtle tropical flavor.
- **Nut butters:** Peanut, almond, or cashew butter also transforms a smoothie into a rich, filling treat.
 
### Mastering Liquid Choices to Control Smoothie Consistency

Selecting the right liquid base is crucial when crafting a thick smoothie. Using too much liquid can instantly dilute your texture, resulting in a thinner drink. A good approach is to start with a small amount of liquid and add more sparingly until you reach the desired consistency. Here are some options that influence thickness:

- **Almond milk or oat milk:** These plant-based alternatives tend to be less watery than regular milk and provide a creamier mouthfeel when used cautiously.
- **Cold brewed coffee or tea:** These add unique flavors without increasing the liquid volume too much and can create a pleasantly thick drink when combined with ingredients like banana or yogurt.
- **Coconut water:** While hydrating, it is quite watery. Use in moderation and compensate with thickening agents.
- **Water:** Use minimally, as it thins down smoothies quickly.
 
### Blending Techniques to Optimize Texture

How you blend your smoothie affects the final texture greatly. For a thick smoothie, follow these blending tips:

- **Freeze your fruits and veggies:** Using frozen ingredients reduces the need for ice and creates a thicker, colder base.
- **Add liquids last:** Place all solid ingredients in the blender first, then pour just a little liquid on top to avoid over-thinning.
- **Use pulse settings:** Pulse blend your ingredients initially then blend continuously to help components mix evenly without liquefying overly.
- **Scrape and re-blend:** Pause the blender occasionally to scrape down sides and ensure uniform thickness.
 
### Additional Tips to Enhance Smoothie Thickness

Beyond ingredients and blending methods, certain tricks help achieve the perfect, thick texture you're looking for without relying on ice cream:

- **Chill your serving glasses:** Pouring your smoothie into cold glasses prevents it from warming too fast, keeping the drink thick longer.
- **Use a high-powered blender:** These can break down tougher ingredients more efficiently, helping smooth out chunkiness and blend in thicker components smoothly.
- **Add small amounts of frozen fruit chips or coconut flakes:** They add texture without watering down the smoothie.
- **Limit liquid sweeteners:** Honey or maple syrup add flavor, but too much liquid form can thin the smoothie.
 
### Balancing Flavor Along with Thickness

Maintaining the right balance between thick texture and flavor ensures your smoothie is enjoyable to drink. If you add thickening ingredients like oats or nut butters, adjust your sweetness accordingly by using natural sweeteners like dates or ripe fruits. Experiment with spices such as cinnamon or vanilla extract to add depth without any liquid.

Ultimately, crafting a thick smoothie without ice cream is about combining the right frozen fruits, creamy natural ingredients, careful liquid control, and skillful blending. With these simple tricks and ingredient swaps, you can enjoy a rich, satisfying smoothie that feels indulgent yet nutritious.

</div>Alternative Ingredients to Boost Smoothie Creaminess and Nutritional Value Naturally
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Discovering Natural Ingredients for Creamy Smoothies

When you think about thick and creamy smoothies, ice cream might be the first ingredient that comes to mind. However, there are plenty of natural alternatives that can boost both the creaminess and the nutritional value of your smoothie without any added dairy or sugar. These ingredients not only create that luscious texture but also bring unique flavors and nutrients that elevate your smoothie experience. Let’s explore these options and how they can transform your blends into health-packed treats.

### Avocado: The Green, Dreamy Cream

Avocado is a superstar when it comes to enhancing smoothie texture naturally. Its buttery consistency produces an incredibly smooth and thick result, making your smoothie feel indulgent without any guilt. Beyond texture, avocados are packed with healthy fats, fiber, and essential vitamins such as vitamin E and potassium. These nutrients support heart health and improve digestion, making avocado a double win.

To use, simply scoop out half an avocado and blend it with your fruits and liquid base. It pairs especially well with banana, spinach, and berry blends.

### Banana: The Classic Thickener

Bananas are probably the most common natural thickener used in smoothies, and for good reason. They add sweetness, creaminess, and a dense texture that helps to create that thick, satisfying sip. Plus, bananas bring vital nutrients including potassium, vitamin B6, and fiber, which promote energy and gut health.

Using frozen bananas is a pro tip to increase smoothie's thickness while keeping it chilled without watering it down like ice would.

### Nut Butters: Creaminess with a Protein Punch

Adding a dollop of nut butter—such as almond, peanut, or cashew—introduces healthy fats and proteins that contribute to a smooth, rich texture. This addition supports muscle repair, sustained energy, and satiety, making your smoothie more filling.

Be mindful of the quantity, though. About 1-2 tablespoons per smoothie is usually enough to add creaminess without overwhelming the flavor or increasing calories too much.

### Oats: The Underestimated Multitasker

Rolled oats or oat flour may surprise you as a smoothie thickener. They absorb liquid and swell, creating a creamy density that feels luxurious on the palate. Beyond texture, oats are a fantastic source of beta-glucan fiber, which helps to lower cholesterol and stabilize blood sugar levels.

Try blending in ¼ to ½ cup of oats for a smoothie that feels hearty enough to replace a meal.

### Silken Tofu: A Plant-Based Cream Booster

For those aiming for a dairy-free and vegan-friendly option, silken tofu is a hidden gem. Its soft texture blends into a perfectly smooth and thick consistency without affecting the taste much, allowing fruit and other flavors to shine. Tofu is also a great source of plant protein, iron, and calcium, enhancing the smoothie’s nutritional profile.

A ½ cup addition is enough to add creaminess and protein, ideal for post-workout recovery or a nutritious breakfast.

### Chia Seeds and Flaxseeds: Natural Gels that Thicken

Chia and flaxseeds provide a unique way to thicken smoothies by forming a gel-like substance when soaked in liquid. This natural thickening method adds both texture and a boost of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidants. These nutrients promote brain health, reduce inflammation, and improve digestion.

​ Discover the delicious smoothie plan that lets you eat normally while you shed the weight! -Click Here to Learn More--&gt; https://freepage.pro/loganferret/smoothiediet   
To use, soak 1 to 2 tablespoons of chia seeds or ground flaxseeds in a small amount of water or milk for 5-10 minutes before blending. This gives your smoothie a gelatinous, thick feel without overpowering flavors.

### Coconut Cream and Greek Yogurt: Rich and Thick Alternatives

If you want a creamy boost without ice cream, coconut cream and Greek yogurt are excellent choices. Coconut cream delivers a tropical richness with healthy fats that contribute to smooth texture and satiety. It’s perfect for those seeking dairy-free richness.

Greek yogurt, on the other hand, offers a tangy creaminess loaded with protein and probiotics. These promote digestive health and muscle maintenance, especially useful after exercise.

Adding a few tablespoons of either ingredient to your smoothie will instantly thicken it while elevating its health benefits.

Using frozen fruits such as berries, mango, or pineapple not only cools your smoothie without dilution but also naturally thickens the final texture. Unlike adding ice cubes—which tend to melt and water down your drink—frozen fruits maintain a cold temperature and add fibrous bulk that thickens the blend.

### How to Combine These Ingredients for Ultimate Creaminess

The magic lies in balancing these ingredients to suit your texture preferences and nutritional goals. For instance, combining frozen banana with avocado provides a velvety base, while a spoonful of nut butter and oats adds body and protein. Finishing touches with chia seeds or flaxseeds can boost fiber and omega fats without sacrificing smoothness.

Try developing your own combinations by experimenting with quantities and taste. Remember to add liquids slowly as you blend to control thickness, aiming for a texture thick enough to enjoy with a spoon if you like.

Exploring these alternative ingredients will help you craft smoothies that are luxuriously creamy and packed with nutrition—without relying on ice cream. Your body will thank you, and you’ll enjoy every sip of these wholesome, delicious creations.

### Conclusion

Mastering the art of creating a thick smoothie without relying on ice cream is easier than you might think. By focusing on essential tricks like using frozen fruits, incorporating natural thickeners such as chia seeds or nut butters, and controlling the amount of liquid, you can achieve a creamy, velvety texture that satisfies your cravings. These methods not only improve texture but also boost the nutritional value of your smoothie, making your drink both delicious and healthful.

Choosing alternative ingredients like Greek yogurt, avocado, or oats enriches your smoothie with protein, healthy fats, and fiber—all vital for sustained energy and satiety.

By experimenting with these techniques, you’ll unlock a world of smoothie possibilities that are both indulgent and nutritious. This approach ensures you can enjoy thick, satisfying smoothies anytime, tailored to your taste preferences and dietary needs. Whether you’re after a quick breakfast, a post-workout boost, or a tasty snack, these strategies empower you to create the perfect texture and flavor without compromising on health.

Ultimately, crafting thick smoothies without ice cream is a smart and simple way to enjoy a wholesome treat.

1kbx4pg,https://i.redd.it/7aey2u8lq2ye1.jpeg,My 1st attempt at a clarified New York Sour,"This took me 2 hours to make and it came out just as I had hoped it would. 

Clarifying the sour rounded out the taste and gave the drink a smoother mouthfeel. 

The ingredients-
1.5 ounces of bourbon 
.5 ounces of lemon juice
.5 ounces of simple syrup
.75 ounces of whole milk
1 ounce of a dry red (I used Malbec)

The process-
1 combine the bourbon lemon and simple syrup in a glass to make a whiskey sour. In a separate glass add the milk
2. Slowly Add the whiskey sour to the milk and give it a stir then let it sit, covered, at room temp for 1.5 to 2 hours
3. Using a coffee filter or cheesecloth strain the concoction and separate the liquid from the solids. 
4 discard the solids and add ice to the liquid. Use a bar spoon and float the wine over the cocktail.

My thoughts 
Right know your going through a hard time I feel it. Loosing someone you were once close to can really hurt for a very long time. Even more so if they are still in your life. The best thing you can do for your self right now is not to be tempted to go back to then. I know your questioning thing right now. Wondering if what you did was infact the right choice. It was going back will do you no good it will only leave you more hurt in the end. I feel that your slowly coming out of your funk though which is great. Your starting to feel more like your self and free. No one to pin you down just you and the world a head. Yes stay on this path it's the right one for you ! I also hear that you need to focus more on you. Do some real deep digging to find some awnsers to some questions you might be having. Do this as well. It's thr most important thing! Just don't forget to have some fun along the way as well because that is equally as important ! 
Tarot 
A) four of swords in reverse. You are in a state of recovering from something. I don't think this is in a sickly manner at all ( although for some it might ). No I'm hearing it's more emotional. Someone hurt you and hurt you bad. It as taken you moths to get to were your at know. This is ok everyone handles things differently. I'm just happy that your slowly coming out of it. So yes deffinitly right know your in the recovery zone. Things are just starting to look up and your happy about that. B) lovers. I see you were with someone you though could have been the. This turned out not to be true and your starting to see that. Everything is coming to the forfront, and your starting to see the truth of the matter. You chose to leave for a reason. Stick with your gut . c) four of cups. I feel that you as a person have come more alive know that your apart. I think your starting to feel that as well. You no longer feel changed down. You feel free finally to live your life the way you want to. I mean yes your still hurting but your starting to see the brighter side of it all. D) judgment in reverse. Still there is a peace of you that is holding on to your ex. Don't look back there don't even let it tempt you. The past is the past for a reason. So leave it there. No good will come out of that and you'll just end up 10 times more hurt. Look forward and move on. You can do this!

Affromation cards 
A) the presence of love will always cast out fear. When I see and read this don't think about about your ex. However what does come out strong is you. The love for your self is what you need to find. You need to focuse on finding you again this is most important. Then you can think about dating once you do. B) obstacles are detours in the right direction. Your ex was just a obsitcal in your life plane and simple. He was put there to teach you a lesson of some kind. It might have been a hard one but a lession none the less. If you don't know what this lesson is maybe it's w good time to start looking into it. Sometimes if the lesson is big enough it will continue happening untill that lesson is learned. 

Mindfulness cards
A) drink water. Do you drink enough water thoughout the day? I now I could do better at this as well. Water is 70% of are body's and needs to be added to all day long in order for are bodies to work properly. So try to drink as much water as you can. It might take away some headacks and body pains as well. B) write "" morning pages"". This is a great way to start your day with a clear mind. Write in your journal or make a list to acomplish through out your day in the morning. Soon after you get up. Do it with out judgment and see how much you can get through when the day is down. You'll be surpised how freeing this would be! C) tea or coffee ritual. This will make your morning more relaxing for you. Meditate while making and drinking your coffee or tea in the morning. Really take it all in and enjoy every second of it. Not only will your coffee taste better you will feel more relaxed to. 

Messages from the universe 
A) "" bigger and better expeeiences are coming your way. You may not be able to see it, but great things are coming together for you as you read this. Trust the process and let it unfold in Devin timing. Move forward knowing that all is working out just fine"". This is just a card reminding you not to look into the past there are more better things coming for you know. You might not be able to see it yet but it's there and coming in your direction.

You can't cobtinue to see and interpret things with the same understanding that you had had until now. No matter what you face or how you feel see it all from a higher perspective"". You are moving g forward with your life now which is exciting. But there will be some changes along the way. Try to go with the flow as much as possable. Your going in the right direction don't you worry! 

Astrology cards 
A) Rhinoceros/brave/reliable/ tenaciouse. You are going into new territory know, and yes it can be scary. It can also leave you on herd because you might not know the area or people to well yet. Relax there is nothing to fear. If anything make sure your doors are locked that is it. Change can suck like that but you got this! You have been through way worse before. B) iguana/ self - awareness/ faith/ growth. Know is your time to brake free of everything that heald you back. Go on that adventure you always wanted to go on. Or take that leap of faith and follow your dreams. Eather way your life is yours now do what you want with it but still remember to make it count. 

Feelings cards
A) fear of abundance. Seems like a funny thing to be fearful of when said out loud right, but yet it's there. I think this is more or less in your head then anything. Your scard that if something is to good then it's probably to good to be true and worth it. But what happens if this happens to be the only thing thats holding you back from everything you ever wanted. Maybe it's time to let this thought go and see what happens. B) shame. What are you feeling shame over. Thought that you might be linging yourself up to get hurt. That future thinking not hear and the know ( I heard anxiety you might be feeling this with the thought of going further ). You might just surpise your self with the out come. So way not at least try. C) love in reverse. I see you really going back wind forth in your mind if this is all worth it or not. I say go for it. If fear is the only thing holding you back why wait. It least this way you'll get the awnsers you want and instead of driving your self crazy

Closing oracles 
A) completeness in reverse. Every time you think about your ex you feel empty inside and uncomplet. Your seeing it as a sine of lonleyness and emptyness without that person. Maybe your looking at it in the wrong way. I mean yes I know it hurts. However what what if this emptyness is really all about you. The fact that that emptyness is really your body telling you that it's missing a peace of you qnd wants it back. This is a great time to work on your self. Find that missing peace. B) intelligence. I know your smart and I know that you know it to. So maybe thr lesson in all this is to find the real you. Maybe you lost your self along the way thats why you continue in what feels like a down word spiral. Do so sole searching and some meditation ( I also heard yoga). Really did deep and find what's hiding beneath of all the rebel that feels like life right now. You got this it will be a journey but you got this I beleve in you! C) prosperity in reverse. I hear the only reason why this card is in reverse is because your journey is not over yet. You still have a bit of a way left to travel so you havent painted your picture perfact yet . keep going and then you will have your prosperity. D) justice in reverse. You might have to right some wrongs on this journey don't get me wrong, and thete might be more lessons to be learnt as well. Don't be scard of this though it's all for the matter of that painted picture in your head. Get it done and move on. E) understanding in reverse. You might nit understand what this is all for right now but soon you will see the bigger picture. It will all be worth it in the end trust me on that. Just keep moving forward and don't give up ! 

Ending cards 
A) today is a good day for a good day. Yes ! So get out there and have some fun. Having fun is an important part of life to. Infact it helps to keep the heart young I always say. I know things feel heavy right know but maybe going out and having fun might lighten tge loans a little. B) together we can save the world. I dont think this is meant in the litteral way. I think it's more or less. If you continue on the right path the world around you will slowly change to. This would would be so much more welcoming and easier to deal with once you know how. C) life is an adventure enjoy the journey. Yes like I said before don't forget to have a little fun along the way. Sometimes it's just plane needed. D) stars can't shine with out darkness. I think you got this one right a away but hear I go anyway lol. Sometimes darkness is needed to find the path again.

1kbwywc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbwywc,Turkish Riviera in spring/summer,"Looking for perfumes to take me back to the Turkish Riviera in spring and summer: a sensual mosaic of turquoise seas brushing against sun-warmed pebbles, the air thick with the scent of blooming jasmine and grilled seafood. Bougainvillea spills over whitewashed walls, and cicadas hum in the olive groves while sailboats drift lazily in bays so clear you can see the ripples on the seabed. Days stretch golden and slow, and the nights—soft, warm, and wine-soaked—echo with laughter under the stars.

I can smell the salt hanging in the breeze, sharp and clean, mingling with the faint bitterness of sun-baked pine needles. There’s the earthy aroma of stone and dust warming under the midday sun, and the occasional sweet drift of ripe figs bursting on the branch. In the markets, the air is rich with the tang of sumac, thes smokiness of fresh-ground Turkish coffee, wild oregano and thyme. Everything smells alive, ancient, and impossibly lush.

Your ex was just a obsitcal in your life plane and simple. He was put there to teach you a lesson of some kind. It might have been a hard one but a lession none the less. If you don't know what this lesson is maybe it's w good time to start looking into it. Sometimes if the lesson is big enough it will continue happening untill that lesson is learned.

Feelings cards
A) fear of abundance. Seems like a funny thing to be fearful of when said out loud right, but yet it's there. I think this is more or less in your head then anything. Your scard that if something is to good then it's probably to good to be true and worth it. But what happens if this happens to be the only thing thats holding you back from everything you ever wanted. Maybe it's time to let this thought go and see what happens. B) shame. What are you feeling shame over. Thought that you might be linging yourself up to get hurt. That future thinking not hear and the know ( I heard anxiety you might be feeling this with the thought of going further ). You might just surpise your self with the out come.

It least this way you'll get the awnsers you want and instead of driving your self crazy

Closing oracles 
A) completeness in reverse. Every time you think about your ex you feel empty inside and uncomplet. Your seeing it as a sine of lonleyness and emptyness without that person. Maybe your looking at it in the wrong way. I mean yes I know it hurts. However what what if this emptyness is really all about you. The fact that that emptyness is really your body telling you that it's missing a peace of you qnd wants it back. This is a great time to work on your self. Find that missing peace. B) intelligence. I know your smart and I know that you know it to. So maybe thr lesson in all this is to find the real you. Maybe you lost your self along the way thats why you continue in what feels like a down word spiral. Do so sole searching and some meditation ( I also heard yoga). Really did deep and find what's hiding beneath of all the rebel that feels like life right now. You got this it will be a journey but you got this I beleve in you! C) prosperity in reverse. I hear the only reason why this card is in reverse is because your journey is not over yet. You still have a bit of a way left to travel so you havent painted your picture perfact yet . keep going and then you will have your prosperity. D) justice in reverse. You might have to right some wrongs on this journey don't get me wrong, and thete might be more lessons to be learnt as well. Don't be scard of this though it's all for the matter of that painted picture in your head. Get it done and move on. E) understanding in reverse. You might nit understand what this is all for right now but soon you will see the bigger picture. It will all be worth it in the end trust me on that. Just keep moving forward and don't give up ! 

Ending cards 
A) today is a good day for a good day. Yes ! So get out there and have some fun. Having fun is an important part of life to. Infact it helps to keep the heart young I always say. I know things feel heavy right know but maybe going out and having fun might lighten tge loans a little. B) together we can save the world. I dont think this is meant in the litteral way. I think it's more or less. If you continue on the right path the world around you will slowly change to. This would would be so much more welcoming and easier to deal with once you know how. C) life is an adventure enjoy the journey. Yes like I said before don't forget to have a little fun along the way. Sometimes it's just plane needed. D) stars can't shine with out darkness. I think you got this one right a away but hear I go anyway lol. Sometimes darkness is needed to find the path again. It's never the fun way of learbing things but it sure does help you shine once you get there.",2,1746062767.0,Tarotpractices,0,1.0,False

He couldnt understand the importance of my family. (31 yo male with a wife and a 1 and 3 yo). Insisted on calling to do step work during my daily prayer and bedtime ritual with my baby boy (had only 1 at that time). Then told me if I was not willing to drop everything to talke his call and read liturature with him then I wasnt willing to go to any lengths. Foumd out later it was intentional to prove a point that AA needed to come before everything else, even that prayer and time with my 1 yo son. I offered to read anytime before or after that 30 minutes with him but it was not good enough. We went seperate ways.

Sponsor 2 took me in a month later and I finished all the steps with him, but he was VERY hands off with my life other than step work. Didnt attend my home group, and didnt have interest in getting to know me or be my friend at all, so I never felt a close bond or that AA brotherhood the big book talks about.

I eventually respectfully asked to see if I could go with a new sponsor who originally said he would be happy being my sponsor and friend in the program. Nothing major, just wanted someone in the program who could make time 1 or 2 times a month to hang out, get coffee, talk about something other than AA and actually feel connected. Said if he needed to work me though steps I would re do them with him even.

He agreed and set boundaries on expectations. It was around 5 hours of readings and then a 2 hour meeting every week for 6 months to re read the big book and additional liturature, as well as to pick up 1 more meeting. I agreed and then he kept adding more and taking away time from my family. This hit a uead when he started to show up to my house un announced and expected I would make what he wanted for me to do work wise happen regardless of my family plans. I told him no 1x and he said if I ever said no again he was dropping me and that its not allowed as his sponsee. That ended my final sponsor sponsee relationship.

That was 6 months ago. I still go to 1 meeting a week with some people that are meeting aquantances only, but it helps and keeps me sober. I have no desire to drink and love my life. But, part of me feels like I am living a lie in the rooms without having a sponsor. I dont think I am qualified to sponsor anyone because I dont have one, and I am scared someone will someday ask as I continue to grow in tenured sobriety.

I just dont want to have another person sponsor me only to have them create more drama and hassle in my life, especially since everything is going great. Is anyone else a sponsorless AA? Can it work if you still work the steps and work your program solo with your higher power?

Coffee and snacks for parents?

Or maybe it’s about making it easy and stress-free?

So way not at least try. C) love in reverse. I see you really going back wind forth in your mind if this is all worth it or not. I say go for it. If fear is the only thing holding you back why wait. It least this way you'll get the awnsers you want and instead of driving your self crazy

Closing oracles 
A) completeness in reverse. Every time you think about your ex you feel empty inside and uncomplet. Your seeing it as a sine of lonleyness and emptyness without that person. Maybe your looking at it in the wrong way. I mean yes I know it hurts. However what what if this emptyness is really all about you. The fact that that emptyness is really your body telling you that it's missing a peace of you qnd wants it back. This is a great time to work on your self. Find that missing peace. B) intelligence. I know your smart and I know that you know it to. So maybe thr lesson in all this is to find the real you. Maybe you lost your self along the way thats why you continue in what feels like a down word spiral. Do so sole searching and some meditation ( I also heard yoga). Really did deep and find what's hiding beneath of all the rebel that feels like life right now. You got this it will be a journey but you got this I beleve in you! C) prosperity in reverse. I hear the only reason why this card is in reverse is because your journey is not over yet. You still have a bit of a way left to travel so you havent painted your picture perfact yet . keep going and then you will have your prosperity. D) justice in reverse. You might have to right some wrongs on this journey don't get me wrong, and thete might be more lessons to be learnt as well. Don't be scard of this though it's all for the matter of that painted picture in your head. Get it done and move on. E) understanding in reverse. You might nit understand what this is all for right now but soon you will see the bigger picture. It will all be worth it in the end trust me on that. Just keep moving forward and don't give up ! 

Ending cards 
A) today is a good day for a good day. Yes ! So get out there and have some fun. Having fun is an important part of life to. Infact it helps to keep the heart young I always say. I know things feel heavy right know but maybe going out and having fun might lighten tge loans a little. B) together we can save the world. I dont think this is meant in the litteral way. I think it's more or less. If you continue on the right path the world around you will slowly change to. This would would be so much more welcoming and easier to deal with once you know how. C) life is an adventure enjoy the journey. Yes like I said before don't forget to have a little fun along the way. Sometimes it's just plane needed. D) stars can't shine with out darkness. I think you got this one right a away but hear I go anyway lol. Sometimes darkness is needed to find the path again. It's never the fun way of learbing things but it sure does help you shine once you get there.",1,1746062327.0,OracleReadings,0,1.0,False

1kbwsxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGCcreators/comments/1kbwsxg/new_to_ugc_where_do_i_start_would_love_some/,New to UGC — Where Do I Start? Would Love Some Guidance!,"Hi everyone! I’m super new to the UGC world and would love to get advice from anyone willing to share.

I’ve been posting consistently on Instagram, and I currently have 712 followers. I’ve been posting almost every day, mostly mom/lifestyle content. My last two reels have started to get more traction (one was based on a trending video format), but overall, I’m still figuring out what works.

I really want to dive into UGC, but I don’t know where to start — platforms to sign up for, how to pitch brands, what to charge, and how to stand out.

I’ve also noticed a lot of people sharing their portfolios… is that 100% necessary to start? Or can I use my current content and build one along the way?

I’d love to hear:
	•	How did you land your first UGC deal?
	•	What platforms/websites do you recommend for beginners?
	•	Any tips on pitching when you’re just getting started?

I’m also looking to expand into TikTok, but I want to keep it more girly and aesthetic — think slow mornings, coffee, beauty, wellness — and not necessarily focused on mom content.

I’ve been growing slowly on Threads too (almost 300 followers from 0), and I’m staying active daily.

Any help, tips, or encouragement would mean so much! I’m committed and consistent — I just want to make sure I’m moving in the right direction.

Thank you!!

My thoughts 
Right know your going through a hard time I feel it. Loosing someone you were once close to can really hurt for a very long time. Even more so if they are still in your life. The best thing you can do for your self right now is not to be tempted to go back to then. I know your questioning thing right now. Wondering if what you did was infact the right choice. It was going back will do you no good it will only leave you more hurt in the end. I feel that your slowly coming out of your funk though which is great. Your starting to feel more like your self and free. No one to pin you down just you and the world a head. Yes stay on this path it's the right one for you ! I also hear that you need to focus more on you. Do some real deep digging to find some awnsers to some questions you might be having. Do this as well. It's thr most important thing! Just don't forget to have some fun along the way as well because that is equally as important ! 
Tarot 
A) four of swords in reverse. You are in a state of recovering from something. I don't think this is in a sickly manner at all ( although for some it might ). No I'm hearing it's more emotional. Someone hurt you and hurt you bad. It as taken you moths to get to were your at know. This is ok everyone handles things differently. I'm just happy that your slowly coming out of it. So yes deffinitly right know your in the recovery zone. Things are just starting to look up and your happy about that. B) lovers. I see you were with someone you though could have been the. This turned out not to be true and your starting to see that. Everything is coming to the forfront, and your starting to see the truth of the matter. You chose to leave for a reason. Stick with your gut . c) four of cups. I feel that you as a person have come more alive know that your apart. I think your starting to feel that as well. You no longer feel changed down. You feel free finally to live your life the way you want to. I mean yes your still hurting but your starting to see the brighter side of it all. D) judgment in reverse. Still there is a peace of you that is holding on to your ex. Don't look back there don't even let it tempt you. The past is the past for a reason. So leave it there. No good will come out of that and you'll just end up 10 times more hurt. Look forward and move on. You can do this!

Affromation cards 
A) the presence of love will always cast out fear. When I see and read this don't think about about your ex. However what does come out strong is you. The love for your self is what you need to find. You need to focuse on finding you again this is most important. Then you can think about dating once you do. B) obstacles are detours in the right direction. Your ex was just a obsitcal in your life plane and simple. He was put there to teach you a lesson of some kind. It might have been a hard one but a lession none the less. If you don't know what this lesson is maybe it's w good time to start looking into it. Sometimes if the lesson is big enough it will continue happening untill that lesson is learned. 

Mindfulness cards
A) drink water. Do you drink enough water thoughout the day? I now I could do better at this as well. Water is 70% of are body's and needs to be added to all day long in order for are bodies to work properly. So try to drink as much water as you can. It might take away some headacks and body pains as well. B) write "" morning pages"". This is a great way to start your day with a clear mind. Write in your journal or make a list to acomplish through out your day in the morning. Soon after you get up. Do it with out judgment and see how much you can get through when the day is down. You'll be surpised how freeing this would be! C) tea or coffee ritual. This will make your morning more relaxing for you. Meditate while making and drinking your coffee or tea in the morning. Really take it all in and enjoy every second of it. Not only will your coffee taste better you will feel more relaxed to. 

Messages from the universe 
A) "" bigger and better expeeiences are coming your way. You may not be able to see it, but great things are coming together for you as you read this. Trust the process and let it unfold in Devin timing. Move forward knowing that all is working out just fine"". This is just a card reminding you not to look into the past there are more better things coming for you know. You might not be able to see it yet but it's there and coming in your direction. So just focus on the hear and knows thats all that is imortant at the moment. B) "" this new chapter in your life is going to require a new way of seeing things and a new way of seeing yourself. You can't cobtinue to see and interpret things with the same understanding that you had had until now. No matter what you face or how you feel see it all from a higher perspective"". You are moving g forward with your life now which is exciting. But there will be some changes along the way. Try to go with the flow as much as possable. Your going in the right direction don't you worry! 

Astrology cards 
A) Rhinoceros/brave/reliable/ tenaciouse. You are going into new territory know, and yes it can be scary. It can also leave you on herd because you might not know the area or people to well yet. Relax there is nothing to fear. If anything make sure your doors are locked that is it. Change can suck like that but you got this! You have been through way worse before. B) iguana/ self - awareness/ faith/ growth. Know is your time to brake free of everything that heald you back. Go on that adventure you always wanted to go on. Or take that leap of faith and follow your dreams. Eather way your life is yours now do what you want with it but still remember to make it count. 

Feelings cards
A) fear of abundance. Seems like a funny thing to be fearful of when said out loud right, but yet it's there. I think this is more or less in your head then anything. Your scard that if something is to good then it's probably to good to be true and worth it. But what happens if this happens to be the only thing thats holding you back from everything you ever wanted. Maybe it's time to let this thought go and see what happens. B) shame. What are you feeling shame over. Thought that you might be linging yourself up to get hurt. That future thinking not hear and the know ( I heard anxiety you might be feeling this with the thought of going further ). You might just surpise your self with the out come. So way not at least try. C) love in reverse. I see you really going back wind forth in your mind if this is all worth it or not. I say go for it. If fear is the only thing holding you back why wait.

1kbwoup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1kbwoup/severe_constipation/,Severe constipation,"This post is going to be full of TMI. Just a warning.

I've always had issues with constipation. Even as a kid, I needed enemas from time to time. When I first started on MJ, I got extra constipated. I added fiber powder to my morning coffee and it's been fairly smooth sailing ever since. 

I have no idea what but something has changed. It's been over a month since I've had a normal bowel movement. I was passing a few hard rocks here and there for a bit and that even stopped. 

I resorted to an enema a week or so ago and got a small amount to pass. I've used stool softeners, probiotics, digestive enzymes. I've been using miralax every day. I eat plenty of fiber. I drink tons of water. I eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. I'm at the gym regularly. I don't know what else to do and I don't know why this is happening.

I'm going to pick up some magnesium citrate laxative liquid tomorrow and give that a try. If the results aren't as expected, I'll make a doctors appointment.

But seriously, what the heck?

I'm on 5mg and have been for 7+ months. Down 115 lbs. ",15,1746061939.0,Mounjaro,34,0.89,False
