1inrk8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1inrk8t/routine_help_how_to_get_my_skin_to_look_normal/,[Routine Help] How to get my skin to look “normal” again.,"I already know, that people are going to tell me it could be a numerous reasons as to why my skin looks like this. I currently do not have insurance for a dermatologist as of the moment, so advice & tips would be so great fully appreciated! 

To start off, some relevant (maybe irrelevant but I’m detailed oriented) factors: I am [26M], oily/combo skin type since puberty. I live in northern Utah, (Known as “high desert climate”) Elevation- 4,810ft. It’s been a pretty cold winter as of recently, I experience occasional dryness on cheeks/in or around my facial hair, & frequent chapped lips. I do have raynauds syndrome (link to those who don’t know what it is) https://www.reddit.com/r/Raynauds/ 
I’m on top of my water intake, typically close to a gallon a day 5/7 days of the week. I eat fresh or frozen vegetables with dinner and sometimes lunch almost every day. I eat lots of fruit, I do consume a lot of diary such as a morning yogurt each morning, ice cream for dessert, and lots of cheese! I do however eat processed food more than I should. I drink coffee daily, and Diet Coke regularly. I drink alcohol about 3 times a week, usually consisting on beers, seltzers, or Sailor Jerry’s Diet Cokes! I am recently in recovery due to cocaine addiction (definitely has damaged my skin!) I am a daily user of nicotine (vape/occasional cigarette)
I use unscented laundry detergent and softener, I wear a hair system most of the time, and I sleep in a protective bonnet so the oils I use don’t touch my skin, and when I’m at home doing nothing I’ll wear a sweatband to keep my hair out my eyes, and when I’m not wearing my toupee I wear beanies or a cap. 
I live with a chihuahua/wiener dog mix, and a short haired cat. (Long haired cats and short haired dogs tend to give me allergies more than these cuties) 
We vacuum and dust regularly, however our house is very close to a lot of commercial and residential development being built causing lots of stir up of dirt, and our street borders a huge empty field, so it’s always dusty here. 
I should mention my dad has had several surgery’s for his basal cell carcinomas, due to constantly being in the sun. 6 years prior to now I had a very short period in life involving using tanning beds a couple times a week for almost a year. (Noticeable damage already) 

I definitely know I should change my diet and lifestyle a bit and stop my bad habits, and environmental factors and the pollution in Salt Lake City are terrible, but my skin has almost gotten worse in the last year (probably due to my addiction and not enough hydration and nutrition) than it did in high school. I did have pretty typical teenage acne in high school (cheeks and temples, occasional breakouts around mouth) to which I used GOLD BAR DIAL SOAP on my face, with switching up  moisturizer frequently, never really paying attention. My main concerns are the pores, my texture, redness, and dark circles. 

Daily: Cleanse with CeraVe foaming facial cleanser, tone with Thayers unscented witch hazel (once a night), and I go between either The Ordinary Niacinamide 10%+Zinc 1%, or the MAC Hyper Real serumizer (mainly niacinamide). I then moisturize with the CeraVe daily moisture lotion, and mornings only for SPF, I use the Beauty of Joseon relief sun: rice and probiotics SPF 50+

3x a week: liquid exfoliate with Paula’s Choice 2% BHA nightly (just started using again this last week after a 2 month break) 

That’s my skincare routine^^^^^^

Occasionally: Mud masks, under eye gel patches, and sometimes tanning facial drops when I have a self tan. 

Any advice would be appreciated, sorry if it’s too detailed but I find those details to be important possible reasons. Recommended products, diy products, recommendations for cleaning, diet, etc. Proven effects and damage caused from what I’ve chosen to put into my body, anything! Thank you.

EDIT- I found the skin cancer accurate to add because of the risk and my family history of how common it is, even though every family member who’s had it was raised in either Southern California or Florida (doesn’t matter but we don’t nearly get that kind of sun)",1,1739369165.0,SkincareAddiction,2,1.0,False

1inrjrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCoffeeTables/comments/1inrjrw/affordable_and_functional_coffee_table_review/,Affordable and Functional Coffee Table Review: Ameriwood Home Parsons 5099096,"Testing the Ameriwood Home Parsons Coffee Table, model 5099096, was a mix of practicality and simplicity. As someone who values furniture that prioritizes both form and function, this coffee table delivered in many areas, though not without a few compromises. The espresso finish is understated yet elegant, blending seamlessly with a variety of room styles, whether modern, minimalist, or rustic. I placed it in my living room, where it complemented the soft beige sofa and a jute rug, creating a cozy ambiance.

The table's dimensions—19 inches deep, 39 inches wide, and 17.5 inches high—make it ideal for small apartments or dorm rooms. It's large enough to hold essentials like remotes, snacks, and even a few magazines without overwhelming the room. Despite its compact size, the surface can accommodate up to 50 pounds, making it surprisingly sturdy for its lightweight construction. My little niece even used it as her mini desk for an impromptu coloring session, and it held its ground without a wobble.

[Ready to snag Ameriwood Home Parsons 5099096? See Amazon’s price.](https://decorgurus.com/product/ameriwood-home-parsons-coffee-table-review-model-5099096-b009oba2v8/)

**Design and Quality**  
Crafted from PVC-laminated hollow core, the coffee table boasts a dark espresso finish that is sleek and smooth to the touch. However, the material isn’t real wood, which is evident upon closer inspection. While this keeps the table affordable and lightweight—ideal for frequent movers—it does sacrifice some durability. I noticed that the surface is prone to scratches and stains, especially when exposed to heat or moisture. A coaster became an absolute must when placing my coffee mug on it.

**Assembly and Maintenance**  
One of the most impressive features is the hassle-free assembly. The table arrives with pre-drilled holes, and the legs screw in by hand. It took me under five minutes to put together, and no tools were required. This simplicity is a blessing for someone like me, who has a love-hate relationship with flat-pack furniture. Maintenance, however, is a bit more demanding. The finish, while visually appealing, requires gentle cleaning with a damp cloth to avoid damage. It’s not water-resistant, so accidental spills need immediate attention.

**Storage and Stability**  
The minimalistic design lacks additional storage options like shelves or drawers, which might be a drawback for anyone needing extra functionality. Stability-wise, the table performs admirably on both carpet and hardwood floors. The legs are precision-cut, ensuring there’s no wobbling unless uneven weight distribution occurs. Still, I wouldn’t recommend sitting on it or placing anything overly heavy, as the hollow core construction might not withstand such pressure.

**Pros**

* Lightweight and easy to move around.
* Simple to assemble without tools.
* Affordable price with a sleek espresso finish.
* Compact size suitable for small spaces.
* Holds up to 50 pounds, decent for everyday use.

**Cons**

* Surface prone to scratches, stains, and heat marks.
* Limited durability due to hollow core materials.
* Lacks additional storage features.
* Not ideal for heavy-duty use or high traffic areas.
* Requires careful maintenance to preserve finish.

**Comparison with Competitors**  
When compared to similar budget-friendly coffee tables, the Ameriwood Home Parsons stands out for its aesthetic appeal and ease of assembly. For example, IKEA’s Lack coffee table offers a comparable price point but feels less sturdy and requires more effort to assemble. On the other hand, the Furinno Simple Design Coffee Table comes with additional storage options like lower shelves but lacks the refined finish of the Ameriwood. While not as durable as solid wood options like those from Ashley Furniture, the Parsons table excels in affordability and lightweight convenience.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
In terms of value, this coffee table is a strong contender for anyone on a budget. It’s not designed to last decades, but for short-term use in apartments, dorms, or as a secondary table, it’s hard to beat. While the materials and build quality reflect its low cost, the overall aesthetic and functionality make it worth considering. Just don’t expect it to replace a high-end wooden table in terms of durability.

**Features and Options**  
The Ameriwood Home Parsons Coffee Table comes in an espresso finish that pairs well with most décor. Its simple, rectangular shape and flat surface make it versatile for various uses—from holding a laptop to serving snacks during a movie night. The absence of customizable features or additional compartments might seem limiting, but this straightforward design is precisely what makes it appealing to those seeking no-fuss furniture.

**Personal Experience**  
During my two weeks of daily use, the table served its purpose effectively. Whether I was working on my laptop or hosting a casual game night, it provided a reliable surface. My only concern was the occasional smudge and scratch that appeared after placing a hot plate directly on the surface. My advice? Always use coasters and placemats to keep it looking new.

1inriyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1inriyr/best_milk_frother_foodville_mf05_review_is_it/,Best milk frother FoodVille MF05 review: Is it worth the hype?,"Testing out the FoodVille MF05 rechargeable milk frother over the past month has been an interesting experience. As someone who enjoys indulging in frothy cappuccinos and silky lattes, I was curious to see if this compact handheld device could elevate my coffee game. Spoiler alert: it has, but not without a few quirks.

This frother is sleek and lightweight, with a stainless steel design that screams modern minimalism. It came with two interchangeable heads—a standard frother head and a balloon whisk—which I found useful for different kitchen tasks. The USB-C charging is a lifesaver compared to battery-operated models. After a full charge, it easily lasted me a few weeks of daily use, making it a reliable companion during my caffeine-fueled mornings.

One feature I appreciated was the turbo mode. By pressing the power button again, the frother kicks into high gear, making it effortless to whip up creamy foam in seconds. I tried it with both dairy and plant-based milks, and the results were consistent—a rich, velvety foam every time. However, I did notice that its power can be a double-edged sword. Using it in a shallow or wide mug often led to splashes, turning my countertop into a mini disaster zone. Pro tip: use a tall, narrow cup to avoid the mess.

[Click here to see the price](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-milk-frother-foodville-mf05-review-b0bvbfh497/).

Beyond beverages, I even tested the balloon whisk for mixing protein shakes and scrambling eggs. While it performed decently, I wouldn’t say it replaces a traditional hand mixer for tasks like batter or thick mixes. The two-button operation (separate on/off buttons) was initially confusing. I kept hitting the wrong button in a rush, which caused some chaos when liquids started to splash. This design could definitely use improvement.

**Pros**

* The rechargeable design eliminates the hassle of replacing batteries.
* Turbo mode provides excellent frothing power for smooth results.
* Lightweight and easy to maneuver, making it perfect for daily use.
* Versatile attachments cater to more than just frothing, like mixing protein shakes or whisking eggs.
* Holds a charge impressively well, lasting several weeks on a single charge.

**Cons**

* Overpowering speed can lead to splashes; not ideal for shallow mugs.
* Two-button design can be inconvenient and poorly distinguished.
* Not as effective for thick batters or heavy-duty whisking tasks.
* No stand included with certain versions, making storage slightly awkward.
* Requires careful handling to avoid spills due to its power.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When comparing the FoodVille MF05 to other handheld milk frothers like the Zulay Milk Boss or the PowerLix Frother, a few distinctions become apparent. The MF05’s rechargeable feature is a standout advantage; I’ve used battery-powered alternatives and found the constant battery changes both wasteful and inconvenient. However, models like the Zulay Milk Boss are slightly more user-friendly with their one-button operation, which avoids the on/off confusion of the MF05.

In terms of sheer frothing power, the MF05 beats most competitors hands down. The turbo mode ensures faster frothing, but this power can be excessive, especially when compared to more controlled devices like the PowerLix Frother. Both competitors also tend to be more compact and come with stands, which makes storage easier—something I missed with the FoodVille.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The price point of the FoodVille MF05 places it somewhere in the mid-range of milk frothers. Given its rechargeable design, durable materials, and versatility, I believe it offers solid value for money. While cheaper models might save a few dollars upfront, the rechargeable feature alone justifies the cost in the long run by eliminating the need for frequent battery replacements.

That being said, it’s not flawless. If you’re someone who values convenience and simplicity, the two-button design might be a deal-breaker. For those who need a frother mainly for beverages and occasional light mixing, this is a worthwhile investment. However, individuals looking for a multi-purpose tool for heavier kitchen tasks might want to consider alternatives.

As someone who thrives on caffeine to kickstart the day, having a coffee maker that promises speed without sacrificing quality is like a dream come true. But, like any product, it’s not without its quirks.

The design is simple yet effective. The black body with the stainless-steel finish gives it a classic, no-nonsense look that fits well in most kitchen settings. It’s not flashy, but it also doesn’t scream ""cheap."" The materials feel durable, and the commercial-grade stainless-steel water tank inside is a nice touch. However, I did notice the lid where you pour in the water felt a bit flimsy. A coworker who owns the same model warned me to be gentle with it, as hers broke within the first week.

[Check BUNN GRB Velocity Brew price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/bunn-grb-velocity-brew-review-model-38300-0064-b000ffrz26/)

This coffee maker is all about speed, and it delivers. Brewing a full 10-cup pot in just three minutes is impressive. I’ve tested it multiple times, both with a full pot and single travel mug servings, and it’s consistent every time. The multi-stream spray head evenly saturates the coffee grounds, resulting in a rich and flavorful cup of coffee that rivals what you’d get at a café. My spouse, who prefers weaker coffee, even commented on how smooth and balanced it tastes. That said, if you live in an area with soft water, you might need to call BUNN for a flow restrictor to avoid overflow issues.

Customization is where this machine falls short. Unlike some competitors, you won’t find adjustable temperature settings or brew strength controls. This might be a dealbreaker for those who like to tweak their coffee to perfection. Personally, I didn’t mind, but I can see why others might.

Ease of use is another highlight. The buttons are straightforward, and the manual operation means there’s no fiddling with digital screens or complicated settings. The lack of a timer or auto-brew feature might seem like a drawback, but considering it brews so quickly, I didn’t miss these extras. I do wish, however, that the warmer plate had an automatic shut-off. On more than one occasion, I’ve forgotten to turn it off, and it’s a bit of a safety concern.

Cleaning this machine is relatively painless. The parts are easy to disassemble, and the stainless-steel tank doesn’t accumulate grime as quickly as plastic. That said, deep cleaning the internal tank requires some effort, and you might need an extra pair of hands to lift it.

The size is perfect for most kitchens. It’s compact enough to fit under cabinets but still has a decent 10-cup capacity. The water tank holds 70 ounces and is always hot, which is part of why it brews so quickly. However, this also means it’s not ideal for occasional coffee drinkers, as you’ll need to turn it off to avoid the tank running dry.

**Pros:**

* Lightning-fast brewing time (3 minutes for a full pot).
* Consistently good coffee flavor with a smooth, café-like taste.
* Durable stainless-steel water tank.
* Straightforward, user-friendly design.
* Compact size fits well in smaller kitchens.

**Cons:**

* Lack of customization options for brew strength and temperature.
* No auto shut-off for the warmer plate.
* Flimsy water lid prone to breaking.
* Requires regular maintenance if used daily.
* Not ideal for occasional coffee drinkers due to the always-on hot water tank.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to other coffee makers in its price range, the Velocity Brew stands out for its speed and simplicity. Machines like the Keurig K-Classic offer more customization with pod options but can’t compete with the rich flavor of freshly brewed coffee. On the other hand, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 provides more advanced features like brew strength control and a built-in timer, but it takes significantly longer to brew a full pot. For those who value speed and flavor over bells and whistles, the BUNN GRB Velocity Brew is a solid choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While it’s not the cheapest coffee maker on the market, the Velocity Brew justifies its price with its performance and build quality. It’s perfect for daily coffee drinkers who prioritize speed and taste. However, if you only drink coffee occasionally or need advanced features, you might want to explore other options.

The BUNN GRB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer isn’t flashy, but it gets the job done—and fast. It’s the kind of coffee maker that grows on you with each use, despite its minor flaws.

1inrhf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutonomyHealth/comments/1inrhf8/tip_2_identify_the_junk_or_unnecessary_foods_in/,Tip #2: Identify the Junk or Unnecessary Foods in Your Diet,"Taking a good, hard look at your diet can be like inspecting a stranger’s cart at the grocery store: enlightening, cringeworthy, and full of questions. But fear not—this step is essential for healthier eating habits. First, let’s face the villain of your culinary tale: junk food.

These calorie-packed saboteurs may infiltrate your diet:

* **Soda and sugary coffee drinks**: Liquid desserts in disguise.
* **Chips, cookies, and candy**: Delicious, sure, but they’re basically empty promises wrapped in salt and sugar.
* **Processed snacks**: Easy to grab, easier to regret.

Let’s be real. Junk food is convenient, tasty, and always there for you—unlike your ex. But it’s also sabotaging your health and weight goals. The solution? Ghost it. Replace that daily soda with water or unsweetened tea. Swap out chips for nuts or fruit, and make peace with whole-grain crackers instead of cookies. It’s a glow-up for your pantry.

Rome wasn’t built in a day, and your junk food habits won’t vanish overnight. Start small. Replace one snack at a time, and don’t look back. Soon, you’ll find yourself snacking on almonds instead of chips and wondering how you ever thought neon-orange cheese dust was a food group.

This isn’t a temporary breakup; it’s a divorce, a lifestyle change. You’ll pave the way for long-term success by ditching junk and embracing healthier options. And who knows? Maybe you’ll even stop craving that bag of chips after dinner (or at least crave it less).

So, here’s to a future filled with mindful eating, fewer sugar crashes, and maybe a little less shame when you peek into your snack stash. You’ve got this

I am an OS who recently started to work on my first cargo ship. The Theseus was in search of extra hands, and I was in search of a job, so the fit seemed perfect. The large amount of paperwork given to me prior to embarking had surprised me, but this was, again, my first cargo job, and I assumed this was customary.

However, when the non-liability waivers in cases of serious bodily or psychological harm or death were placed in front of me, it made me worry for a split second. But I had done well in training and was broke, so I really needed this. The pay would be fantastic. Like, five figures for a month of work- fantastic. Knowing that the average OS salary is between 900 to 1,300 a month, I more than needed this.

It was only the third day on board when the first crew member went missing, a mechanic named Teddy. We had received the news during dinner. After an extensive search on board, the first mate informed us there was a mistake with documentation, saying Teddy had never even boarded the ship. Any protest, claiming crewmates have talked to Teddy on board, were met with a swift “Theodore Hunters never boarded the Theseus”.

The second to go missing was my buddy Phil. He was one of the new guys, just like me. He disappeared four days after Teddy did. I was with him the night it happened. We had left the sleeping quarters to go out for a cigarette on deck. The flame of my lighter offered a brief relief from the cold. For a moment, we simply blew smoke into the crisp air and looked out into the darkness around us. At night, the sky and sea fused into one endless black void. You couldn’t see a thing. But the sound of wind blowing and waves crashing into one another kept us grounded and calm.

“One more week to go” Phil muttered as he took a drag from his cigarette.

“You got another shipment soon after this one?” I asked, flicking ashes into an ashtray I held in my hand.

“Nah, I’m goin’ home.”

“To the missus, huh?” I joked.

I saw his jaw tighten in the faint glow of the small deck lights.

“Not anymore.” He sighed, “My girlfriend recently broke up with me.”

I kicked myself at my stupid comment.

“Aw, man. I’m sorry to hear that.”

He looked straight in front of him.

“Yeah, she said the ‘spark’ was just gone.” He cleared his throat. “I really loved her. Was gonna propose. Sometimes I think I can still hear her voice. I can still smell her perfume-” he started to choke up.

“Hey man, I’m really sorry. That’s terrible.”

“Yeah, well…” He cleared his throat again and quickly rubbed his face while inhaling sharply. “But what about you, huh? You got a special girl in your life? Special boy?”

I snickered

“No, no, none of that for me. I’m happy on my own.”

“Uuuuh-huh.” He laughed and lit up another cigarette. He offered me a light for my second one.

We stood there smoking in silence again for a short while.

“Do you know what the cargo is?” I asked.

“What?”

“The cargo on the Theseus. What are we transporting?”

“From what I have heard some circus equipment. Trapezes, stages, tent poles, sound equipment, that kinda stuff. Some European circus needs more stuff I s’posse.”

I glanced over at where the cargo was kept. It looked like a second ocean of green and blue shipping containers. The containers were huge, like those containers millennials would renovate into tiny homes or small bungalows.

“Seems like they need a lot of stuff.”

“Big circus I guess.”

I felt the conversation starting to die out, so I decided to head back to the sleeping quarters, while Phil stayed back for his third cigarette. When leaving, I smelled the faintest hint of a woman’s perfume; floral and soft.

The next morning, Phil was gone and I was called to the captain’s quarters for questioning. I was asked to reveal everything we had talked about the previous night. When I came to Phil’s recent breakup, the captain and first mate exchanged knowing looks. They concluded that Phil had jumped overboard.

“We are sorry for your loss.” The captain said in his thick Dutch accent. “Instances like these happen sadly all too often.”

“What do we do now? Do we turn back?” I asked.

“Turn back?”

“There was a suicide on board, shouldn’t we turn back? Contact someone?”

“The right people will be notified about this,” the first mate interrupted me, “We don’t turn back. Standard protocol, kid. You’re young and inexperienced, so I understand how shaken up you are by this, but this is something you sadly get used to.”

And get used to it I did. When the third crew member, an intern named Isaac, had gone missing, I was hardly phased anymore. The first mate came up with another explanation, and work went on.

Yesterday, I finally understood what truly happened to Teddy, Phil and Isaac. I was almost the fourth.

I was out on the deck again, having a smoke and reminiscing on the last conversation I ever had with Phil.

I started to smell the women’s perfume again. It was warm and inviting. It was sweet, almost sickly sweet. Almost.

That’s when I saw them, faintly, in the dim glow of the sidelights. Women. Around six of them. Happily bobbing around in the dark waters. Swimming alongside the Theseus. They turned towards me and waved.

The sweet smell had me in a sort of trance, I don’t remember at all finding it odd to see a group of women swimming in the ice-cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean at 2 at night, days away from civilization. They called out to me. Their voices were the most beautiful things I have ever heard. Soft and melodious, the tones caressed my face. I tried my best to look closer. Their faces seemed to shift in the light. One of them had the face of my middle school crush, another was the cute barista who once gave me a coffee on the house, and another looked like my last girlfriend. When I blinked, they had other faces of previous work crushes, ex-girlfriends, one night stands,… Their faces shifted so often, morphing each of the women into amalgamations of my love interests. And they were beautiful. The faces were so, so, so beautiful.

They called out to me again. Told me to join them. I cannot describe their voices, they were the sweetest melody human ears could ever perceive. I had to go to them. The pilot ladder. I could take the pilot ladder down. I swung myself over the sides of the ship and started my slow descent down on the ladder. The wind stung my face and squealed in my ears, but their voices kept me warm. I needed to hear more of the voices. I now know of course, this is stupid. But you simply weren’t there. If you heard the voices too, you would understand the unmatched compulsion. I was almost down, the women surrounding the water under me, crowding around the bottom of the ladder.

A loud clank is what shook me back to awareness. I later found out some idiot hadn’t tied down something properly which fell due to the hard wind. I looked back at the women. Their faces… my God, their faces. I only caught a glimpse before they disappeared back into the dark water, but that glimpse was enough. It was enough. Small, fish-like eyes on the front of their faces. No nose, no ears, no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelids. Gills poked out of their necks and their mouths… Large and unhinged, like snakes. Have you ever seen a shark’s teeth? The rows and rows of razor-sharp teeth? Theirs were like that. Their tongues were like a lamprey’s, moving back and forth in anticipation.

Diving back into the water, they disappeared into vague silhouettes under the surface. I climbed back up the pilot ladder with all my might, letting myself fall onto the deck once I had reached the top. I took a second to catch my breath and sat up, looking out onto the ocean, the silhouettes gone. I puked.

Right now, I have locked myself in a storage room. I can’t do this journey anymore. Not knowing those things took my friends and will continue to do so. The boatswain is knocking at the door. I will not open it. Not until I have answers. I will sit out this journey in here. It’s only two more days. Wish me luck.",1,1739368546.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1inr9hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1inr9hw/fears_do_come_true_best_friend_has_just_started/,Fears Do Come True: Best Friend Has Just Started Dating,"Mga mahal, kailangan ko lang ng makikinig dahil hindi ko na alam ang nangyayari. Parang sasabog ang puso ko at buong pagkatao ko.

So I have a best friend of 15 years. He doesn't know that I'm closeted and that I've been in love with him ever since. As in buong life ng friendship namin itinago ko ang feelings ko for him. I don't want to confess to him because I know it'll change the dynamics of our relationship and ayoko siyang mawala 'pag nalaman niya na mahal ko siya. Tapos straight pa siya.

Sobrang saya ng friendship namin. Masaya akong kasama siya lagi, from weekly/monthly coffee sessions to travels abroad. And somehow, I've convinced myself na okay na for things to stay this way. I always tell myself that these feelings are my problem and mine alone, and I don't want to burden him with them.

For context, no girlfriend since birth siya. May niligawan siyang tatlong girls nung college, but it didn't work out.

Whenever I have daydreams about him (like magiging kami or the like), ini-interrupt ko na agad and sasabihin ko na okay na ako sa friendship nami. Kasi after all, he doesn't owe me attention, affection, and love. Tapos, I always wish na sana magka-girlfriend na siya para masampal na ako ng katotohanan. Pero, natatakot pa rin ako na baka dumating nga 'yung panahon na 'yun...

...at dumating na nga 'yung panahon na 'yun. Earlier today, may ni-reveal siya sa akin at sobrang saya niya nung sinabi niya 'yun--na magkaka-jowa na daw siya. May ka-talking stage siya, pero 'di pa niya sinabi kung sino dahil hindi pa siya ready i-reveal.

...but somehow I found out kung sino 'yung ka-talking stage niya--and it's a guy! I found it out based sa mga hints and clues na dinrop niya and I'm 96% that it's that guy. And na-realize ko na he's not ready to reveal the identity because my best friend is probably closeted.

May part sa akin na 'di na na-surprise, dahil at some point, nagkaroon ako ng assumption na baka bisexual or bi-curious and best friend ko. Because there are signs gaya nung may na-like siyang alter tweet sa twitter, pero I didn't make a big deal about it.

Despite those signs, I didn't dare confess my feelings for him kasi nga he's my friend. And baka mamaya, accident lang pala 'yung pag-like niya at mapahiya pa ako and ma-out ko sarili.

Hindi ako makagalaw and makapagsalita. Dahil to be honest with you, it'll be less painful if babae 'yung ipapakilala niya. But now I know that it's a guy, I just confirmed that very thing na lagi kong sinasabi sa sarili ko: wala akong pag-asa sa kanya.

Gusto kong sumigaw and umiyak pero 'di ko magawa. A tiny part of me screams na sana I took the chance and confessed to him. Did I miss the chance? Did I miss the train?

But my rational self would say na wala talaga akong pag-asa and 'di niya talaga ako gusto. Dahil kung meron man siyang kahit na katiting na pagtingin sa akin, he would have shown interest. Tama 'di ba? Sa tagal ba naman naming magkaibigan.

I just went to the gym to distract myself, but instead my thoughts raced and made me more anxious. Thankfully, nakatapos ako ng mga sets. But I really want to cry and grieve.

Mahal na mahal ko siya and I want to be happy for him. Kasi nung kinwento niya sa akin 'to, masayang masaya siya and kilig na kilig. And somehow, I was happy na nakikita siyang ganun.

As a consolation to myself, I just tell myself na hindi kami magwo-work out kung maging kami and we'll just lose the friendship forever if mag-break man. Dahil para sa akin, mas mahalaga ang friendship namin kaya pinili ko na lang na 'wag umamin.

Kaso, mga mahal nag-o-overthink ako at nagkaroon ako ng mga bagong isipin at takot:

1. That I would lose him as a friend eventually, kasi magiging busy siya sa lovelife niya. But he assured me na maga-allot daw siya ng oras para sa akin. And two years ago, sinabi niya na 'di siya mawawala sa buhay ko. But I don't want to latch onto those promises because life happens.
2. Na baka if maging sila nung guy, magkaroon 'yung guy ng impression na love ko si best friend and baka maging dahilan ako ng away nila or anything. Takot lang 'to, because I know my boundaries and I won't do anything na ikakasira ng relasyon nila.
3. The solution to number 2 is to distance myself from him, especially 'pag naging sila. May times within this day na nagpu-push sa akin na mag-migrate na and mag-umpisa uli. But he's my best friend and ayoko siyang biglang iwan sa ere ng walang dahilan. Kumbaga, we acknowledge that we love each other as friends and brothers. Ang daming nangyayaring masasakit sa buhay niya, and ayokong mawala rin ako kung kailangan niya ng sasandalan (or am I overestimating my worth here?).

Ang hirap magpanggap na 'di nadudurog ang puso ko ngayon, pero I want to show him that I support his lovelife. And kahit papaano, natutuwa ako na sobrang saya niya--para siyang bata na binigyan ng candy and that's the happiest he's been in a very long, long, long time. I want him to be that happy always, pero ang sakit, sakit, sakit, sakit.

Sorry, sobrang haba nitong kwento ko. Kailangan ko lang ng mapaghihingahan.",5,1739368342.0,phlgbt,4,1.0,False

1inr83r,https://www.reddit.com/r/etiquette/comments/1inr83r/neighbors_constant_requests/,Neighbor's constant requests,"My partner and I recently met one of our neighbors who lives a few houses down. He’s an older man, probably retired, since he often takes walks around the neighborhood for things like coffee runs. Whenever we’ve seen him, our interaction has been limited to a quick wave and hello.

A few months ago, late one evening, he knocked on our door asking if he could use our phone to call the police. We learned that his roommate had locked him out of the house and was refusing to let him back in. Since it was cold and late, and he wasn't wearing a jacket, I insisted he come in while waiting for the police to arrive.

The conversation was a bit awkward, but he was very nice. We found out that the house is rented to adults with disabilities (he mentioned conditions like ADHD, and people recovering from various issues), so it might be a recovery home. He also mentioned that he doesn’t work and is home most of the time.

Fortunately, the police arrived, and everything was resolved. Since then, he has asked to use our phone three more times, always during the day, so it hasn’t been as startling as the first time. However, my partner and I both work from home, so these requests can be a bit disruptive—especially when we're on calls.

It seems like he doesn't have a phone, and we want to be good neighbors and help when we can. But at the same time, it’s starting to feel a bit uncomfortable. We’re not sure if we should buy him a pre paid phone where he can get minutes (as a holiday gift), or if we should put a sign on the door explaining that we’re working and can’t be disturbed.

I don’t want to be rude, but we also can’t be his go-to phone provider every time he needs one.

1inr5pi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1inr5pi,Helene Darroze at the Connaught (3 star),"So funny story, we were looking to go somewhere fancy for a pricey but ""reasonable"" lunch and saw that Helena Darroze had a table for the £125 for 3 courses. This ticked all the boxes but when we turned up the 3 course menu wasn't offered so we sucked it up and went for the full tasting menu. When in Rome and luckily a decent bonus meant we could swallow it. In the end, everything was amazing except the price. I don't think the experience is so much better here to warrant the extra £££ over the 1 stars i have been to but incredible meal

Amuse-Bouches,
Can't remember what each one was but they all had different flavours, textures and spicing. Lovely. Had multiples throughout the whole meal (only 3 captured here). The mushroom soup drink was spectacular

Onion Soup
When you go to a 3 star you want to have a dish that blows you away (vegerable pie at Ducasse for example). This was mine. So much going on in such a simple dish, the cheese and bread were a glorious combo. Very memorable

Prawn/Beetroot
I can't eat the prawn but my wife said it was delicious, it looked amazing. The beetroot was really nice but didn't make me go ooo

Lobster
Signature from Helene, this was lovely. The spicing was magnificent, slow gentle warmth throughout but never overpowering. I can see why it's a signature

Hare
Really lovely textures here with the slow cooked hare in the middle, really unctious meal. Lots of butter

John Dory
Fish done well is nice. Fish done really well is very nice. Perfect fish with some punchy cauliflower was a great dish

Guinea Fowl
Everything cooked to perfection and a great combo but nothing to make you go think wow

Sea Buckthorn
Had no idea what of expect from this but it was full of flavour and refreshing. Really surprising and tasty desert

Chocolate
Rich indulgent chocolatey goodness, but too much by the end to finish it all off

Drinks
Had 2 very nice cocktails (the connaught in general does some of the best cocktails in london) and 2 very nice glasses of wine

Verdict
Everything here is of the highest quality. It was the most comfortable I have ever felt in a restaurant, the room and furnishings are lovely. Staff really engaging and fun. All the crockery was stunning, especially the wine glasses. The food was some of the best we've eaten, every dish tasted phenomenal and some had plenty of surprises. I will also say the portion sizes were much bigger than normal, we were stuffed by the end. But, would I recommend it? Only if you have money to splash.

It's so weird because it's only a problem for me at work. I go to the office once per week and on that day I find that after just a few hours of being in the office, I smell so bad 😭 TMI but if I use the bathroom, even just in morning or midday, my underwear will already have such a strong smell. Not even just the hooha, but the whole area. And I can detect it just walking about and it makes me feel awful. I hope to god no one else can detect it but I absolutely hate it and have no idea what to do about it! 

I'd assume it was the underwear or less breathable clothes or a problem with pH or soap etc but it's never like this the rest of the time. I can wear the same underwear any other day and it won't happen to me. I can skip showers for days and I won't have that odour.

At the moment I'm using panty liners to manage it, but they really don't help that much. The only thing I can think is that it's from sitting down on an office chair for hours making me sweaty, or it's some kind of stress sweat. I'm an anxious and relatively shy person and the office does stress me out, but is that really enough to cause this?!

I didn't realize there was anything strange until I turned sixteen and started to have visions. The first time it happened, I was at school paying attention to a lesson and it suddenly seemed like a little number popped out of nowhere beside the head of a boy I secretly fancied.

I stared at that number very puzzled and shocked and looked around the class wondering if someone was using a laser that made the numbers appear in that strange way. But no one was looking in his direction and he continued to talk normally to a boy seated beside him, like nothing was the matter.

I stared at him for a whole minute wondering if something I had eaten that morning could have possibly made me sick or if, somehow, I was just having a bad day and should make nothing of that little sign. I rubbed my eyes a dozen times and the little, yellow sign continued firmly in its place and stayed in there for all day long.

It was a number 4.

For the rest of the day I didn't look in his direction, afraid I would start seeing something even more absurd. 

I arrived home feeling puzzled and uneasy with myself. What sort of thing was that number on the boy's head? It was big enough that I could see and it had a yellow, bright color to it, which made it perfectly visible but no one seemed to care. It made me wonder if I was showing some signs of craziness...

I lived with my auntie for as long as I could remember. She was a very serious, rigid woman who didn't allow me to leave home or to make many friends. It was really a miracle she let me go to school and to the grocery store but, apart from these places, I was always basically home and never had much to do outside the protectiveness of our little house.

On that particular day, my birthday, Auntie seemed a bit tense and acted out of sorts and more abruptly than usual. She was never really kind and rarely talked about my mother, her sister, but at least she never beat me or let me starve. And I've been receiving new clothes and jackets each year, together with a new pair of shoes, and it was enough so I wouldn't feel any great necessity.

I arrived home after school and the first thing I did was to go after my auntie to look attentively at her, wishing to see if she somehow had grown a number next to her as well. But when I found her in the kitchen, there was nothing in there, no yellow sign or anything out of normal. She was doing soup for the night and I was a bit sad for not having my birthday acknowledged in any form, but it was her way of doing things and I was not expecting anything different, anyway.

She sensed my presence and gave me a strange look, evaluating my person from head to toe, like she was trying to find a difference in me I didn't know was there. I felt very hot and flushed and didn't know what was expected of me in that situation.

She made a sound with her tongue like I was the most enervating person in her life, and asked me with a gruff sneer, ""Do you have something to tell me, girl?"" 

I gave an almost imperceptible gasp because it was almost like she knew I had something on my mind. It certainly was not possible for her to know what was inside my head. There is no such thing in this world. But her eyes seemed like burning flames looking at me and I could feel a scorching sense of anxiety growing inside me.

""No... auntie. It was... just a normal day."" I nervously swolled waiting for her to reveal my lie. The way she was looking at me was so strange... It was almost like... She was waiting for something to happen. She didn't seem to like my words. She didn't seem at all convinced. Her eyes told me she expected me to confess.

But I sealed my lips after my answer and tried to act like nothing was out of normal. In fact, nothing was wrong, really. It was just something of my imagination. The number means nothing because it was never there in the first place.

Auntie turned around and continued her cooking. I felt almost boneless with relief after so strong inspection but... Well, I really had nothing to tell.

We ate the soup with some warm bread and watched some television after. She didn't comment on my new age or give me any presents. It was like any other day on this earth

But inside me, I felt this little thing, like a little thing no one could see. It was a little thought, almost like something I had created myself, that was not there yesterday. What should I do with this, I had no idea. But when I went to bed that day, I thought with great apprehension that nothing would really be the same in my life and I should prepare myself for whatever it was this thing I had received when I was sixteen.

I received the confirmation things would never be the same when I entered school, the next day. I saw another number. And another. And another. They were everywhere.

They were yellow and shiny little signs. The little numbers taunted me with their presence and made me sick with concern for my sanity. Each one of them showed something different and each boy had a different number hanging beside their ears. 

There were boys in school I sometimes made silly dreams in my head about them, and the number near them varied between 1 and 3. One of them even had a decimal number on him: just 0.5.

Witnessing such a strange appearance made me feel as if something cold was being poured over my bones so that the ice seemed trapped inside me and my own spirit trembled with fear at such a whirlwind of feelings. I was standing in the middle of school looking at the boys and their numbers with pure dread coming from inside my heart.

I ran to the bathroom and used the toilet, feeling the bile rising in my throat as a burst of nausea left me weak and made me kneel in the cubicle I had entered.

Maybe it was a vision, something my eyes had created that meant nothing at all. I couldn't believe that I had simply gone crazy... it couldn't be... I was only 16. I should just ignore it and hope the numbers will go away someday. I was just having a bad day and it certainly wasn't going to be like this forever.

My life went on, but the numbers never went away. They multiplied and appeared in the most alarming circumstances. Some boys had no numbers next to them, others had the same number continuously. Sometimes, someone who had never had a number would suddenly have one after a while. And this would sometimes happen after a brief interaction between me and that person. When I looked again, next to that boy appeared a bright yellow sigh. A new number, a new mystery.

When I turned eighteen, I saw for the first time the highest number I had ever seen. A new boy entered my school, bringing with him an excited murmur of girls who crowded around him every chance they got. I noticed him on his first day, but I didn't dare look in his direction too much. I noticed that he was handsome and tall, but other than that impression, I preferred not to have any contact with him. Not that he would have noticed me anyway.

Walking into the cafeteria one day, near the end of the year, with all the excitement for graduation, I stopped in line to get a meal, and I didn't realize that this boy was right in front of me. When he turned and smiled at me, I was surprised and didn't smile back right away. But his eyes looked at me with a certain warmth and he introduced himself by saying his name and I answered mine when he asked. ""Savannah. My name is Savannah."" He invited me to sit at the table with him but, at that moment, I was startled by the number that appeared next to his face. Number eighteen. The biggest number I had seen so far.

I didn't know what to do other than stare at that number as if it were a terrifying apparition right in front of me. Up until then, the largest number I had seen was 5, and strangely enough, it appeared next to a younger substitute teacher who had been in our school for some time. His eyes followed me more closely when I was in his class, but other than that, I had never met anyone with a number higher than 5, and so I felt extremely intrigued by this boy having a bright 2-digit number shining in my direction.

I made an excuse not to sit with him and for the rest of the days until graduation, I looked in his direction a few times and that number was still there, without changing its shape, but hiding its meaning from me.

It was strangely scary to have this secret that I couldn't tell anyone, for fear of the strangeness it would certainly bring and the judgment I would certainly face. I was afraid that this madness would become something worse and that I would start seeing more sinister things that I didn't even want to think about. The numbers were already a big enough annoyance in themselves. They took away from me the desire to look into the eyes of the boys I knew. I was afraid of what I might see or what it might mean. Added to the fact that I didn't leave the house much, I felt out of place in most situations and, even though I had some friends among the students in my class, I felt different in a way that prevented me from developing any kind of true bond with anyone.

I don't know what could have happened between me and the new boy with the number 18 next to him. He asked me to go to the prom with him but I refused, not having the courage to look him directly in the eyes when I did. After that, I didn't have much opportunity to worry about why I refused, because my aunt arranged for me to start working at a small grocery store that one of her friends owned, so my life became limited to working, going home, and taking care of the house chores.

At twenty-one I met the next highest number I had ever seen. Twenty-two. It was standing next to a man dressed in a well-cut suit, his hair finally combed to the side, and his bright coffee-colored eyes seemed warm and appreciative when they looked at me. I was in the cashier that day and he came directly at me when he entered the little grocery where I worked.

Up until that point, I had barely noticed any other numbers because they were all small for the most part and didn't seem strange anymore. But this particular man introduced himself with a smile, taking my hand and bringing it to his lips. He asked my name and invited me to have a coffee with him.

I didn't accept it, but he left a card and a smile saying goodbye. I felt something different with that number. I was determined to ignore its existence because it didn't affect me or make a difference in my life. But why did it exist and what did it mean? Why wasn't anyone seeing it? My life had changed so much since they appeared. It was like I had to wait for a certain number, a unique number to appear so I could make a decision. I held the man's card with the number 22 next to his face, imagining what it would be like if I dared to call him. I knew it was impossible for me to do so. But I could dream and I could pretend I was bold enough to call.

When I returned home that day, I had the card safely tucked away in my purse, and it seemed uncomfortable to have been placed in a dark place where I couldn't see it. I was curious as to why that unusual number had caught my attention. I didn't even know what it meant. But still, something strange was happening, and I couldn't explain why I felt so bothered by its appearance.

I started preparing dinner as I normally did, but something on my face probably caught my aunt's attention, because she asked me bluntly, ""What number did you see today?""

I froze, feeling terribly exposed and afraid and, for a few seconds, I didn't turn to look at her because I felt trapped as if a chain was holding me in place. I turned my head and saw that she was looking at me directly without blinking, and the fear I felt evaporated by the calmness that was on her face.

She didn't seem worried or judgmental. She was just asking something that would sound normal to anyone listening. But for me, the meaning was something completely terrifying. How could she know?

""Do you know about the numbers?""

""Yes.""

""Why didn't you say anything?"" I asked, suddenly feeling betrayed. I had been living with this strange apparition for over 5 years and had never dared to speak up. But she had known about the situation all along. ""I thought I was crazy. Why didn't you tell me? What are these numbers?!""

""What number did you see today? You seem to have found it interesting enough to keep quiet and to be thoughtful.""

1inr04q,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1inr04q/advices_from_someone_who_recovered/,advices from someone who recovered,"hi ! first of all english is not my 1st language so sorry if i make mistakes with the grammar.

my first panic attack ever was in july 2024 and i recently recovered from months of hell due to this.
i have extreme empathy for everyone who is going through this so i thought it would be nice to share here how i made things better.
to quickly explain my experience i always had minor anxiety in my life and i was actually very happy when my first panic attack came. nothing could have explain why it happened. i think that a lot of us are worried about death, so if you have health anxiety too it makes things even worse. what triggered mine is that someone told me i was having a stroke while i was just too nervous because i drank too much coffee this day. it instantly became a huge panic attack until i couldn’t even move. usually when people talk about panic attacks they forget to tell you that you litteraly feel like you are dying, and also all the physical symptoms that can goes with. my legs were shaking, my arms and my hands were blocked, even my eyes were shaking. i couldn’t stay calm and i had to go to the ER. 

then for a month my life went normal, i didn’t had another one, until on a random day in italy it happened again, for no reason at all. i was outside and i litteraly had to lay on the ground bc i thought i was going to faint. from this day, every single day until december i had multiple panic attacks. i had to wake up my friends and family during the night, and it went so bad that i couldn’t stay alone at home. i was constantly affraid of going out, i was even afraid to drink coca cola or coffee that can cause me palpitations. i had everyday the fear of dying of a heart attack or a stroke.

it started to scare people around me so i finally started everything i could : go to the doctor and start therapy. now if i had to be honest, what truly helped my was anti depressants. i also understand that not everyone wants to take a medication.
usually i learned that it happens bc your nervous system is not regulated. if you can, check first with a doctor to see if there is no physical problems. so now here are all the things that you should try :

- don’t watch too much content about anxiety and panic attacks. i know it can help, but if you do too much you will be even more focus on it and your mind will never rest.

- for my health anxious people, stop listening too much to your body. i know sometimes physical symptoms feels horrible, but you feed them if you analyse it too much. trust your doctor. AND DON’T GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS PLEASE.

- see a therapist if you can and if you are ready to talk about it. 

- avoid people that can’t understand you. at least don’t talk with them about this. it’s not helpful when people minimalise what you go through.

- avoid horror or stressful content in general, especially horror movies or things like this for a moment (as a horror movies fan it was boring lol but trust me) sometimes just a bit of adrenaline from a scary scene can trigger an attack.

- if you are having one while you are alone,don’t start to walk around or to avoid it coming. once it’s here, deal with it. if you can, call someone that knows your situation to distract you. i you have nobody, it may sounds weird but tell chatgpt. this thing can tell you what to do to calm your and for once the breathing exercices were truly benefic. if it really doesn’t go away and if you can, take an anxiolytic (just one) and wait until it works.

and please, for the ones that deal with this horrible thing for way too long, don’t be scared to take medication. i was scared too. i tried everything and it was still coming back. i think that if you tried everything too, you have to try this. everyone can have a different treatment, there is a lot of meds that can be helpful. for me it was effexor, the first week on it was litteraly terrible, i had to go to the work of my mom because i was in a terrible condition. and then, a few weeks after, everything went better. i didn’t had any panic attacks. it takes some time, but it worked. 

i still have some physical symptoms sometimes, my stomach hurts bc of some digestive problems due to the anxiety i still have sometimes, even if the attacks are gone. for this i recommend you digestive infusions or some anti spasmodics meds if it’s really problematic. I do take it sometimes and it truly helps too.

i really thought i will never recover from all this sht and that i would have to deal with it all my life, which is probably true, but when you know how to fix it in a way or another it truly isn’t that terrible i promise.
take your time and don’t be hopeless you will win this. ❤️",2,1739367587.0,PanicAttack,1,1.0,False

I could wake up at 6 and some mornings might still have the burning until noon.

Coffee / caffeine aggravate it a lot. If I try to eat in the morning it GUARANTEED makes me very nauseous. Definitely have heart burn at least. Sometimes I just lie awake in bed for a few hours because I know if I get up I'm going to feel like absolute shit.

I love to garden and grow my own veggies in the summer in my small veggie garden. Also have a variety of flowers, bushes and house plants!

I love working out and staying active. I use to be a personal trainer. I mostly do weights now and play some soccer. I have a home gym

In my free time, I play guitar....but not well. I enjoy 90s alternative, classic rock, 00s emo plus a variety of other types!

And I can’t forget my awesome German Shepherd!

Would love to chat and see where things go. Hope youre having a good day

I'm really struggling to find another soft eyeliner pencil in the same warm brown shade, most of what I find is black brown or bronze. I'd really like a matte warm brown.

1inqtjq,https://i.redd.it/5cmgf3k8npie1.jpeg,Missouri AG Brews Trouble for Starbucks Over DEI Practices,"Oh, what a brew-haha! Missouri's Republican Attorney General, Andrew Bailey, has decided to grind Starbucks' diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) beans into a fine legal powder. In a lawsuit that's as frothy as a venti caramel macchiato, Bailey accuses the coffee giant of brewing up discrimination under the guise of DEI.

According to Bailey's 59-page lawsuit, which seems to take longer to read than waiting for your morning coffee during rush hour, Starbucks has been unfairly favoring diversity over ""merit"" since 2020. He's particularly steamed that the workforce has become ""more female and less white"". Because, apparently, having a diverse team is akin to serving decaf when everyone expects espresso.

Bailey's solution? He wants a court order to stop Starbucks from what he calls ""discriminatory patterns and practices."" He argues that Missouri consumers are now stuck paying premium prices for their lattes because, according to him, Starbucks isn't hiring the ""most qualified"" workers—translation: those who match a very specific demographic profile.

Starbucks, however, isn't taking this lying down. They've shot back with a statement that's as robust as their dark roast, defending their hiring practices as inclusive, fair, and competitive. They're essentially saying, ""You want a lawsuit? Here's your lawsuit with a side of our commitment to equality.""

This legal spat comes at a time when President Trump, back in the White House, has declared open season on diversity initiatives, dismantling them across federal agencies faster than you can say ""Grande Pumpkin Spice Latte."" 

So, grab your coffee, folks, because this lawsuit is set to be one of the longest-running shows in town, with more twists than the line at a Starbucks drive-thru during a morning rush. Here's hoping the truth comes out with less bitterness than the last sip of a cold brew.",1,1739367042.0,30DegreesCollective,0,1.0,False

I’m a 33F, and for months, I’ve been using Bumble BFF to build casual friendships in my city, like grabbing coffee or beers, going on hikes, etc. But this is already the fourth time I’ve run into the same scenario:

-I match with someone.

-We text a bit, discussing general topics, including work (I work in a niche IT field).

-Suddenly, the conversation takes a 180-degree turn, and my texting partner starts bombarding me with questions about open positions.

-An innocent question is fine, I totally get why people ask in this job market, but it never stops.

-Even if I try to change the subject or suggest a potential meetup, the conversation always circles back to jobs. They look for my LinkedIn, send me their CVs, ask for HR contacts, etc.

Again, I completely understand and sympathize with everyone struggling to find a job. But I’m on Bumble BFF as a person looking for connections and friendships, not as a recruiter. It honestly makes me sad that some people only seem interested in me because they think I might help them get a job.

We have hung out through college, and hobbies. She recently came out of a 4 year relationship a few months ago and I've supported her through her difficult times.

As a result, in the last few months I have hung out more than ever and found myself caring more and more. However, I worry that one side of my head can't shake the momentary ""what if"", while the other side doesn't want to ruin a strong friendship and make her think I was feeling this way all along/playing the long game. This other side of me can't shake the following obstacles; her dad has the same name as me, I feel she's way out of my league, as friends we never built up flirty/sexual chemistry, and she always uses me to text info on where she's meeting a new date in town as she trusts me as her friend (she says she is just meeting new people but she's usually not sure of them).

The latter is becoming an issue; I'm becoming jealous/too overthinking when hearing about her going for a coffee or drinks with anyone else, even though they all end as one or two dates. I never viewed her this way in the past when she was in relationships.

**Biscione:** ...Is what I know to be proper business etiquette, but... M-master, can I just ask you a question first?

* Of course, go ahead.

**Biscione:** Umm... Master, are you working right now? Or is this your off time?

* Well, I'm working on a report right now
* I guess you could call that work.

**Biscione:** O-oh, I see! I'm so sorry for bothering you during your work!

**Biscione:** I... feel a bit relieved, but also disappointed... I made this purely out of impulse, so I just don't feel comfortable giving it outside of a private situation...

**Biscione:** No, I came here with the resolve to leave it all up to Master's situation, so I'll stick to my original goal like a good newbie!

* Is there something you need help with?

* Of course!
* It's handmade too, which makes me really happy with it.

**Biscione:** But... I just thought of something. I'm sure that I'll be like this no matter what path I choose to follow, but something that'll never change is that I'll always be by Master's side, like a loop. Or, I hope that's the case.

**Biscione:** It's like there's a Master behind me and in front of me. If that's what the future has in store, then I'd feel safe for sure-- wait.

**Biscione:** Isn't this statement kind of like a... forever-type... p-pro--

**Biscione**: N-N-N-NO WAY! This is definitely moving way too fast! No matter how close we are, we're still Boss and Subordinate! We still need to cultivate that relationship or it'll all be no good in the end!

Valentine's chocolate from Biscione.

Knowing where to draw the line between one's true feelings in private and what they express in public is a crucial skill for all working adults.

The ""standard"" chocolate (top right), shaped like a snake forming a circle with its body, is a lucky charm that expresses the nuance of eternity and immortality. In other words, it's a wish to be able to support each other forever and ever.

On the other hand, the ""personal"" chocolate (center), shaped like a snake holding someone in its mouth, is said to have a sense of familiarity still beloved in Milan, and is meant to represent the nuance of wanting to get closer to someone on a more personal level.

Oh, by the way, if you bring up that the person being eaten by the snake kind of resembles a certain someone...

For the past month, I’ve been testing the FoodVille MF05 rechargeable milk frother, and it’s definitely been a game changer in my coffee routine. Forget having to stir endlessly or deal with clumpy protein shakes—this little device takes care of it all.

The frother features a rechargeable design, which I appreciated because I’m constantly trying to reduce battery waste. With a USB Type-C port, charging is quick and easy, and a single charge lasts me weeks. I use it daily for frothing milk for cappuccinos, blending matcha lattes, and even whisking protein powder into drinks. It’s lightweight and compact, so it doesn’t hog counter space. Plus, the included stand makes it look sleek and neat when not in use.

The FoodVille MF05 packs a serious punch when it comes to power. It has a turbo mode for high-speed frothing and a low-speed setting for gentler tasks. Switching between the modes is simple, but here’s a tip: always start slow if you’re working with a full cup of liquid. There were a few messy incidents on my first attempts, but once I got the hang of it, the results were worth it. It creates a thick, creamy foam in seconds—perfect for elevating my morning coffee game. My kids even enjoy using it for making fluffy hot chocolate, and they love the balloon whisk attachment for mixing pancake batter.

[Check FoodVille MF05 price on Amazon](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-milk-frother-foodville-mf-review-b07v2zgyj1/).

**Pros**

* **Rechargeable and Eco-Friendly**: The USB Type-C charging eliminates the need for batteries, and the battery life is impressive.
* **High Power with Turbo Mode**: Froths milk and blends drinks quickly and efficiently.
* **Multiple Attachments**: Includes a whisk head and balloon whisk, making it versatile for various kitchen tasks.
* **Compact and Stylish Design**: Fits well on the counter and comes with a handy stand.
* **Easy to Clean**: A simple rinse under water is all it takes to clean the attachments.

**Cons**

* **Too Powerful at Times**: The high power can be overwhelming and lead to spills if you’re not careful.
* **Separate On/Off Buttons**: The two-button system can be confusing initially, especially when trying to stop quickly.

**Comparison to Competitors**

While the FoodVille MF05 impressed me with its performance, it’s worth considering how it stacks up against other popular frothers. Compared to the Zulay High Powered Milk Frother, the FoodVille’s rechargeable feature is a clear winner, saving money and the environment from disposable batteries. However, the Zulay model offers a simpler one-button operation, which some might prefer.

When placed next to the Breville Milk Cafe Frother, the FoodVille is much smaller and portable, making it ideal for everyday use or travel. That said, the Breville offers more advanced features like temperature control, which is something the FoodVille lacks.

Lastly, the PowerLix Milk Frother is another competitor in a similar price range. While the PowerLix is known for its sturdy build and decent performance, it doesn’t offer a rechargeable option, making the FoodVille more convenient for long-term use.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Considering its features, the FoodVille MF05 offers excellent value. The rechargeable design saves on battery costs over time, and its versatility means you won’t need separate tools for frothing, whisking, or blending. While some might find the price slightly higher than basic frothers, the performance and convenience justify the investment. Whether you’re a coffee enthusiast, a matcha lover, or someone who enjoys experimenting in the kitchen, this frother earns its keep.

Although I love this frother, it’s not perfect. It could benefit from additional speed settings for more control. The power is great for frothing milk but a bit too much for delicate tasks, like mixing small quantities without splashing. But these are minor gripes in the grand scheme of things.

I had been chatting with him ( him 27 ( bottom) me 31 ( Top ) m)  for a   week ( seriously and I Know him for 2 months ) before we finally met for coffee. He was the most handsome and respectful man I had ever met—there was something special and unique about him that I couldn't quite put into words.

From the start, I felt drawn to him. He listened attentively, spoke thoughtfully, and carried himself with a quiet confidence that made him even more attractive. But there was something else—something I couldn't ignore. Whenever I tried to bring up more intimate topics, he would subtly steer the conversation away or give a vague response.

Then, one evening, he admitted, “I’m still new to the gay world.” That explained a lot. He wasn’t avoiding intimacy because he wasn’t interested—he just wasn’t used to navigating it.

On top of that, he had a lot on his plate. He had just started his master’s in data science and engineering and was struggling to find a student job. I could see how much it stressed him out. Naturally, I offered to help him financially, but he refused. “I appreciate it, but I need to do this on my own,” he had said firmly.

That was new for me. I wasn’t used to being in this kind of situation—wanting to help but having to step back and respect his independence. At the same time, I really liked him. He was different from most guys I’d met, many of whom were more open, more forward—even a little slutty, to be honest. But he wasn’t like that, and I liked that about him. I wanted something real, something long-term, but I wasn’t sure how to approach it with someone still figuring things out.

I even considered leaving some money for him anonymously, slipping it into his bag or hiding it somewhere he’d find it. That way, he wouldn’t feel pressured, and it might ease his stress a little. But would that be the right thing to do? Would he accept it if he knew it was from me?

Should I just keep supporting him in other ways? Invite him to the cinema? Go hiking together? Something casual and low-pressure? I didn’t want to rush him, but I also didn’t want to stay in this uncertain phase forever. He was different, and maybe that was a good thing. I just had to figure out how to move forward without scaring him away.

While taking time off work might seem like a quick solution, there are many ways to reduce stress during the workday without stepping away from your responsibilities. Here are **five effective strategies to manage stress without taking time off work**.

# 1. Practice Deep Breathing Techniques

Deep breathing exercises can help calm the mind and reduce stress in just a few minutes. Take a moment to focus on your breath, inhale deeply for a count of four, hold for four seconds, and then exhale slowly for four seconds. This simple practice can activate the body’s relaxation response, reducing anxiety and helping you feel more centered during hectic moments.

# 2. Incorporate Micro-Workouts

Taking short, 5-10 minute [**micro-workout**](https://minutemicros.com/shop/) breaks throughout your day can reduce stress and boost your energy. Whether it’s a quick set of stretches, jumping jacks, or bodyweight exercises, these bursts of activity help release tension, improve circulation, and increase endorphins, leaving you feeling more focused and less stressed.

# 3. Prioritize Time Management

Stress often arises when tasks and deadlines feel unmanageable. To combat this, organize your workday by setting clear priorities and breaking large projects into smaller, more achievable steps. Use time management tools like step-by-step to-do lists or time-blocking to allocate specific periods for each task. This structure not only helps you stay on top of your responsibilities but also prevents overwhelm, allowing you to approach your work with a clearer, more focused mindset.

# 4. Take Short Breaks

Stepping away from your workspace for a few minutes can significantly reduce stress and improve focus. Whether it’s a quick walk, a coffee break, or just a moment to relax your eyes from the screen, short breaks give you the mental reset you need to return to work with fresh energy and perspective.

# 5. Use Mindfulness and Meditation

Incorporating short mindfulness or meditation sessions into your workday can be an effective way to manage stress. Even just five minutes of mindfulness—where you focus on the present moment and clear your mind—can improve concentration, reduce anxiety, and enhance your ability to handle stress.

You don’t need to take time off work to manage stress effectively. By integrating these simple strategies, you can maintain a calmer, more focused mindset and reduce work-related stress throughout the day. For added benefits, consider incorporating quick [**micro-workout plans**](https://minutemicros.com/shop/) into your routine to help you stay active and energized while managing stress.

1. Transportation: Nagjoin ako ng vanpool sa X. Sobrang accomodating ng Ajy On Board (ajy_on_board sa X). Di nila kayo papabayaan. May assigned contact person per van. Madami silang assigned na lugar para macater iba’t ibang fans from different cities. May Cavite, Batangas and parts of NCR. Plus factor din na may pafreebies. Def a 10/10! Umalis kami sa Mandaluyong ng 11am, nakarating kami sa arena ng 12nn onwards. 
2. Food: May parang food park sa tabi ng arena, can’t remember if malapit sa parking B. Madaming choices BUT mahaba pila. May food stalls din naman sa loob ng arena so dapat may cash kayo para di hassle.
3. Network: May signal sa loob at labas. Pag nagstart na concert parang wala na ata signal masyado.
4. Parking: Para sa mga may sariling sasakyan, mas okay kung maaga kayo para makapagpark sa malapit sa entrance ng arena.
5. Going around the venue: May shuttle! Not sure if this time ay meron pero mukang oo. Libre ang shuttle. Sumakay kayo nang sumakay para di mapagod. 
6. CR: Madami CR sa loob ng arena, malinis din naman so goods din. Hindi ko matandaan if merong CR sa labas ng arena kasi di ako naghanap that time.
7. Since masyado ako maaga para sa concert, what I did ay tumambay ako sa isang cafe. Sumakay ako ng tricycle sa may labas ng stadium. Dun lang kasi pwede magsakay at magbaba ang mga trike. I went to It’s Eight Thirty coffee shop. Maganda yung place + decent naman taste ng coffee. Madami resto sa labas ng arena, magtrike kayo if gusto niyo puntahan. Nag-explore lang ako sa Google maps kaya nadiscover ko yung cafe.
8. Inside the venue: Madaming marshal sa loob at very accommodating din. Malamig ang venue, masarap umupo sa floor while waiting haha! Maganda ang view ko pero not sure pag malayo na yung seats kasi ang reklamo ng iba hindi lagi inoopen yung mga led na nakalagay dun sa mas mataas na part. Sana magawan ng paraan ng 1Z to para mas okay ang view ng mga a’tin.
9. Palabas ng venue: Madaming tao so matagal makalabas ng venue. Nagwait ako ng 10-20 minutes para humupa mga tao. Yung van namin yung ilan sa mga late na nakalabas ng parking dahil di agad nakabalik mga kasama ko sa van so hindi na ganun kabagal yung usad nung time na palabas na kami ng venue.

I'm sure this has been discussed more than once, but I am still having a little trouble understanding. 

I have a Vertuo Next from around 2020 and the Aeroccino. I usually use two regular espresso pods or 1 double espresso with a tiny bit of brown sugar either as a hot latte or a shaken espresso. Not too long ago, I was gifted a bunch of the full size coffee pods. As much as I wanted to love them (the golden caramel sounds so yummy), I just don't love to drink a full cup of nespresso coffee and find that I never seem to finish them when I make them. I recently learned about expert mode but I am still a little confused. 

If I use expert mode and put in a pod that usually makes a full cup of coffee, will it effectively become an espresso shot? Double espresso shot? Will it be more bitter? Or is it some secret third thing I don't know about. 

Also, I know I have to get the app and update my machine to do this, which I am almost positive I can do with my model. I just don't want to waste the time to do it if it won't be something I actually use regularly.

Since I mostly shop online, I spend a ridiculous amount of time looking for the best option, then start overthinking about my finances, and in the end, I don’t buy anything. What helps is that I struggle to make decisions, so by the time I actually decide what to purchase, I start thinking rationally again.

However, I have a huge weakness for beauty products, and with those, rational thinking goes out the window. I often order clothes worth up to €1000, but since most stores have a 30 day return policy, I hold onto them until the last possible day, realize I don’t actually need them, and return everything. If I shop in physical stores, though, I don’t think as rationally and tend to buy stuff I don't need.

Lately, I’ve noticed that I can’t bring myself to spend money on things where I can’t get a refund. This has started to affect my relationships with a few friends because I always split on them if they try to convince me to spend money. I don’t understand myself, there are things I can drop huge amounts of money on without a second thought, but if it’s something like grabbing a coffee for under €10, I just won’t do it and for some reason the rest of my day is ruined because of guilt.

As you know, I've been quiet for a while. The reason for this silence was that I finally had my wedding ceremony without any problems and went on my honeymoon. Now I have an experience I want to share with you. I hope it will give you an idea for those who are planning a honeymoon abroad. 

As a newlywed couple, we thought a lot about where to go for our honeymoon, and a quarter of the 14-month planning process was spent planning the honeymoon. A secluded tropical island, a quiet city in Europe, or somewhere unique in its culture, scenery, and atmosphere? The city itself was fascinating, but we wanted to stay somewhere that would make us feel really special, so the Ritz Carlton Istanbul was the best choice for us.

When we arrived at the hotel, it was just before sunset. From the moment we were greeted at the entrance to our room, the process was very relaxed, we didn't have to rush into anything. We had chosen one of the rooms overlooking the Bosphorus, and when we opened the door, the view was literally breathtaking. Just beyond the glass was the blue of Istanbul, the lights of the city and the ships passing in the distance. I remember the excitement as we walked into the room - we knew immediately that our days here were going to be very special.

https://preview.redd.it/ff06s22ddpie1.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3657d07a4ab43bf24e393f66157ac2e81456b0a

We decided to stay in the hotel that first night instead of going out. We were tired from the wedding rush and wanted to stop and enjoy the moment. The Ritz Carlton Istanbul is a hotel where you can not only stay, but also have a really enjoyable time. First we had dinner at the hotel restaurant. The food was very elaborate, but the best part was the service, because we were a honeymooning couple, and the fact that we could eat just focusing on each other and the view was like a moment out of a fairy tale. In Istanbul you usually have to rush somewhere, but here time seemed to slow down.

https://preview.redd.it/kwsxu9qkdpie1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=604450dc4414e0e748dd7bb7bc4fbe5a61b9131f

The next day we decided to try the hotel's spa. We realized that we had needed this kind of relaxation for a long time. We booked a couple's massage and I can say that we really let go of all the wedding stress there. After the massage, we spent some time by the pool, not thinking about anything, putting our phones aside and relaxing.

The fact that the hotel was in the city center was a great advantage for our honeymoon. During the day, we walked to Galata, had a coffee break on the Bosphorus, and returned to the hotel in the afternoon. After experiencing all the energy of Istanbul, it was a great comfort to return to this quiet and comfortable room.

https://preview.redd.it/z0ssokmhdpie1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=25ef5d0cc708cedcf710c6852b9379d84f8048c7

On our last evening, we drank wine from our room, looked out over the Bosphorus, and really thought about it: A good honeymoon is not only about the destination, but also about how those moments are experienced. The Ritz Carlton Bilgili gave us the opportunity to live those moments to the fullest. It didn't matter that the hotel was luxurious, what mattered was that everything felt natural and in flow.

At the end of our honeymoon, we realized how right we were to choose this place. The Ritz Carlton is not just a hotel, but a place where you can truly feel the most romantic side of Istanbul. If you want to celebrate a special moment, if you want to stay in the city but away from the hustle and bustle, this is a really good option.",1,1739363811.0,u_Material-Ant-6872,0,1.0,False

And it makes me feel ashamed for my feelings and the source of the trauma that possibly resulted in them. Any advice on what should i do now? Have i done something wrong by expressing and telling her about my feelings? Thank you.

Also complimented me a lot, and when i asked her would she accept me as her partner if i wasn't her client she said she would. Then suddenly this anger towards me, it feels horrible and i don't want her to hate me. I apologized to her but i don't know what else to do.

Hey! I’m 23, originally from Romania, but I grew up in Germany. I speak Romanian, German, and my English is getting better, even though it’s not perfect yet. 😊

If you love dogs, we’re already on the same wavelength I have a loyal German Shepherd who keeps me on my toes. 🐾

I enjoy playing board games but also value the quiet of a cozy movie night. The ocean has a special place in my heart, nothing beats a relaxing day at the beach. But don’t be surprised if we also take spontaneous night drives, because I’m currently working on my driver’s license... so soon, I won’t have to enjoy those night rides without a license anymore!😂

I love discovering new things, whether it’s music, restaurants, or traveling. Basketball is a sport I enjoy, both playing and watching. Long walks with good company or grabbing a coffee are some of my favorite simple pleasures. And, by the way, I’m a big fan of horror movies, nothing beats a good scary flick for a fun night in!

I’m looking for a best friend with whom I can have deep conversations, someone who’s open to discussing anything and everything. I want someone who values genuine connection and is ready to support and grow with each other through life’s ups and downs.

I’ll be honest, I’m mostly looking for female friends, as I find that other guys can be a bit too much sometimes. However, that’s not a dealbreaker. If there are any guys out there who want to share a beer and enjoy some good conversation, I’m totally down for that too mfs! 🍻

I’m not looking for something casual, I want a true friendship, one where we can always count on each other and have each other’s backs, no matter what life throws at us.

I’m also always learning and growing, whether it’s in my personal life or in a friendship, I believe that change and growth are part of what makes life exciting. Life is all about progress, and I want someone who’s ready to keep moving forward with me.

Whether it’s hiking in the mountains, checking out a new park, or trying out new recipes, I love staying active and engaged with the world around me. Oh, and for parties? I’m totally down for those too! 😈 

If you’re up for genuine conversations, adventures, and a bit of spontaneous fun, let’s see where this could go!

A few months ago my boyfriend mentioned that a female work colleague (that I'd heard nothing about in the year they worked together) was leaving the job and he was upset as they got along and had stuff in common. I was a little jealous in the moment but moved on from this. I can't remember what started the conversation but I happened to ask him if he's texted other women I don't know about while we've been together and it came out that for 2-3 months since she left work they've been texting and met up for coffee on his lunch break last week without telling me. I asked how often they've texted and he said only a handful, I asked to see his phone (which I have only done once prior in the 5 years we've been together) and they'd actually texted 50+ times. He'd also gone out of his way to buy her a leaving card and she said it was the loveliest thing she'd ever received. She also used love heart emojis despite knowing he has a girlfriend. I've always been very trusting with my boyfriend despite being cheated on by my only 2 ex boyfriends and now I'm not sure what to do, I've moved back to my dad's house over the past 4 days. I go back and forth between thinking I'm overreacting or just wanting to end things, he says he won't delete or block her and won't stop meeting up with her as he feels he shouldn't have to, I'm worried I'll just always feel insecure because I know affairs happen through work and me and my boyfriend met through work ourselves and it first started as casual friendly conversation like he's having with her. Should I be leaving him or just forgetting about the situation? Please don't give me too much hate if you think I'm unreasonable. 


EDIT: he has said in the future he'll tell me if they meet up again but he says I'm overestimating the likelihood they will as they only met up because she happened to be meeting her mum near his workplace. He has also agreed I could meet her if I want but it took some persuading on my part for him to agree to this.

Hey Guys, I have a rocket apartamento and it started leaking water from one day to the other.

I disassembled it and when heating up after turning it on, it became apparent that there's a significant amount of water leaking from the vacuum relief. I'm aware that to a degree, that's expected as the piston pushes out but this is definitely out of the ordinary as there's pools of water underneath.

Also, there's no pressure as a consequence when making coffee or using the steam wand.

**The Liberty Trail after you cross the Man O'War pedway bridge and then head towards Liberty Elementary has a place where an apartment complex has a sidewalk and connects it to the trail.  Nearby this area is a city trash can.  The trash can is usually on**
The trash can is usually on the right side of the trail.  This area of the trail over time has become extremely nasty.  Numerous people from the apartment complex bring their dogs to go to the bathroom in this area of the trail between the sidewalk and the trash can.  The piles of dog feces build up and up over time.  It becomes quite gross.  I was wondering if a MUTT MITT station could be put in this area to try and encourage the residents to pick up after their dogs.  Maybe even signage reminding them to pick up and the problems feces left on the ground and trail cause.  I took pictures of the area where the sidewalk from the apartment complex meets the trail and where the trashcan is located if you need a better visual of the area.  In the fall it was quite covered, and you have to be careful not to let your dog get off the trail here for fear of getting feces on their paws.  It is definitely needing to be addressed before spring and good weather are here once again and the area becomes gross.  Thank you!

The property owner of 952 Gerardi (Michael Schroeder, michaelalanschroeder@gmail.com, 502-797-9683) reached out to LEXserv / LexCall on May 9, 2024, and to his CM and Parks on May 13, 2024, about concerns with trees and limbs in Liberty Park that could fall onto his property and cause damage to his fence or home.  His emails were routed to DES on May 20, 2024 (subject line “Dead trees and limbs”), but without accompanying SRs that would’ve tracked the issue for our follow-up.  Nathan, please coordinate with Mr. Schroeder at your earliest convenience and provide an assessment of the trees that are of concern to him.

I quit coffee last week and by day 2 I was in bliss, felt not rushed for the first time in years and could actually relax, no headaches. Even hangovers became a lot more bearable. On day 14 I have started to wake up every morning with a thumping heart, ruminating and sometimes coming to tears. Has anyone else noticed similar effects to this? It is a bit of a bummer as I was sure that I had found the secret to getting rid of my anxiety and now I am back to square one. ",1,1739362501.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

1inpekv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1inpekv/good_uk_roasters_who_deliver_reasonably_fresh/,Good UK roasters who deliver reasonably fresh coffee,"Hi. I have what feels like an increasingly unpopular question to ask, but I don't know where else to ask it. 

Like the title suggests, I'm looking for good UK roasters who deliver relatively fresh coffee by default, so 7 days or less off roast routinely. 

I understand that the general consensus points towards resting light roasts for three weeks or more, with rest times in the order of several months not being uncommon, but every time I do this I find that the flavour has deteriorated, not improved. 7 to 10 days works best for me. 

Like salt in cooking, I can always add aging myself, but I can't remove it if it's already been added for me. 

Plenty of good roasters who normally deliver coffee two weeks or more off roast will accommodate a request for fresher coffee, but A. I need to remember to do that each time and B. They need to remember that I've requested this before packing the order. Plus the conversation always feels awkward - like I say, an unpopular request these days. 

Any suggestions? I have Crankhouse, Horsham and Hundred House so far. ",0,1739362462.0,pourover,16,0.5,False

They were weird sometimes and boring sometimes. 

I don't remember my dreams that frequently, so maybe I'm dreaming of other places and forgetting?

But for several years now, when I do remember a dream, it took place in one of 5 different settings that are constant. 

There's a library with many floors

there's an old house also with many floors and a spooky basement

there's a coffee shop

there's a weird floating highway that always leads me to a huge airport

and there's a loooong stretch of beach with houses along it. I only ever get to be on the sand or in the water, I've never gotten to the other side of the houses. 

Generally the feeling of the dream decides where it happens, I think. The highway/airport is my stress/anxiety dream location. 

The coffee shop and library are neutral/positive places. 

Does anyone else have this? It doesn't feel normal but it doesn't feel that weird? ",3,1739362441.0,DoesAnybodyElse,3,0.81,False
