My dumbass spilled coffee on this laptop, and although I'm relatively new to laptop maintenance, I took my baby apart and replaced the trackpad. I also took it as an opportunity to replace almost everything with PTM7950 (aside from the CPU). Looking at the CPU and heat pipe, the LM looked poorly applied, and like there was a dry spot near the middle.

1. So long story short, is it worth switching the CPU LM to PTM7950 (for convenience/peace of mind), or to re-paste LM with something like Thermal Grizzly.
2. My CPU temps jumped after taking the G16 apart (all P-cores throttling, even with max clocks turned way down). I checked everything else is making contact with the heat pipe, but can't confirm the CPU. Could it be LM moved as a result of my repairs, or bad factory coverage?

Thanks all in advance!",1,1749132711.0,ZephyrusG14,0,1.0,False
1l405ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l405ey/i_29m_just_got_broken_up_with_by_my_ex_29f/,I (29M) just got broken up with by my ex (29F),"Hi all, just wanted to come here and ask what everyone‚Äôs opinion is on my current situation. 

I 29M was seeing a girl for about 4 months, things were going well, especially when we were just going on dates. I planned all the dates by making reservations, plans, etc. I also paid 100% of the time. Which I didn‚Äôt mind because I know she takes time out of her day to get ready and drive 15-20 minutes to come see me. Plus she‚Äôs in school and not working while I work and pay my own bills already. 

She first started a fight with me 2 months into our relationship by saying I didn‚Äôt ask her to be my gf and broke up with me over text. Mind you, we had just spent the weekend together and she texted me 24 hours prior that she already missed me and wanted to see me again. She saw a comment I posted on my friends instagram post who was a girl and thought I called her ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù in Spanish but what I posted was ‚Äúsister‚Äù - in direct translation I said ‚Äúmy sister is killing it‚Äù in Spanish. The words are very similar to each other in Spanish - ‚Äúhermosa‚Äù and ‚Äúhermana‚Äù. 
The reason I did that was because my friend posted about her being in Mexico. Anyway, the next 2 days after this she doesn‚Äôt text me at all and breaks up with me over text. I was caught off guard and when we finally talked I told her it was a misunderstanding and she also told me she feels weird I have so many friends that are girls, also that I haven‚Äôt asked her to be my gf. I told her it was only 2 months but I also was leading up to ask her, I guess I didn‚Äôt prioritize it because we were basically together all the time. So I didn‚Äôt think I needed to ask her to make it official. 

So anyway, we ended up fixing things. Although I found it so weird she didn‚Äôt communicate to me at all about how she felt. Either way I apologized and we continued like business as usual. I asked her to be my gf a week later. Within that time - I introduced her to my friends as my gf and even mentioned to my parents I was newly seeing someone. 

I also work a lot - 2 jobs. One being a 9-5 and another being a bartender, she had previously mentioned that she‚Äôs insecure about me being a bartender and how she doesn‚Äôt trust me because of that. Even though I did nothing to break that trust prior and she did mention in her past something happened to her that caused her to be so insecure and worry some. I explained to her that what happened in the past isn‚Äôt my fault and that I haven‚Äôt done anything for her to not trust me. So then, last weekend I went to NYC to see my friend and my sister. I guess because I work so much I didn‚Äôt tell her exact details of my trip. I just told her I‚Äôm going to NYC from Friday to Monday. She also doesn‚Äôt know my friend who I am going to visit, he‚Äôs married and lives in the city.  My sister is also married and just had a baby so I went to see her also after seeing my friend. Usually I don‚Äôt text anyone when I‚Äôm away because I prefer to be in the moment and not on my phone much. Although I did post on my instagram a few stories of me being in NYC + my friend who I was hanging out with. I texted my gf at the time - asking her how her day was 2nd day into my trip and she was being very cold. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and tried to engage in convo but no luck, she was very unresponsive.

When I got back she told me she was mad at me, so I asked her to call me to explain why but she made me wait a day because she said she was busy. When she called me she started getting angry saying that I didn‚Äôt text her when I landed and that she didn‚Äôt know who I was with, or what I was doing in NYC. Basically suggesting I didn‚Äôt text her because I was doing unfaithful things behind her back. She also mentioned that I‚Äôm not a man of my word because I texted her saying that I‚Äôll pay for her gas and I didn‚Äôt do so - mind you, I have always paid 100% in this relationship because she was in school and I obviously work a lot. She hasn‚Äôt even bought me a coffee in 4 months, so when she said this I realized she‚Äôs very spoiled in her ways. She also said I gave her nothing because I promised her a dinner date to celebrate her graduation and a weekend away but when I had gotten back I couldn‚Äôt get too much time off work so I had to postpone it. I did however buy her shoes as a present. 

To me she just seemed like a bit of a spoiled brat who expects me to pay for everything and never returns the favour. I also work so much to take care of my parents and run a side hustle with rental properties. Which if anyone knows about Canadian properties it‚Äôs not cheap. So I found it very disrespectful when she said I wasn‚Äôt a man of my word because I didn‚Äôt pay for her gas, and didn‚Äôt give her updates on my vacation. I did text her prior to takeoff saying I‚Äôll let you know when I landed, but when I landed I didn‚Äôt text her because I was busy trying to get a cab and tried from my flight. Also in the 4 months we were together I never once raised my voice at her, I hate fighting and I told her that the first time she tried to end things. We agreed to have open communication but when we were on this call, she was yelling and blaming me for every little thing I did without giving me a chance to explain myself.

1l404tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeCommunity/comments/1l404tc/is_webflow_good_for_blogs/,Is Webflow Good for Blogs?,"ü§î Picture this: You're ready to launch your blog, but you're stuck staring at an endless list of platform options. WordPress? Too complicated. Squarespace? Too limiting. Then someone mentions Webflow, and suddenly you're wondering if this visual web design platform could actually be your blogging goldmine.

I get it. Choosing the right blogging platform feels like picking the perfect coffee blend ‚Äì there are countless options, each promising to be ""the one."" But here's the thing: **Webflow isn't your typical blogging platform**, and that's exactly what makes it both intriguing and potentially perfect for certain types of bloggers.

After diving deep into Webflow's 2025 capabilities, testing its features, and analyzing real user experiences, I'm here to give you the unfiltered truth about whether Webflow deserves a spot on your blogging shortlist.

# What Makes Webflow Different? üé®

Before we dive into the blogging specifics, let's establish what Webflow actually is. Unlike traditional content management systems that separate design from content, **Webflow combines visual web design with powerful CMS functionality**. Think of it as having a professional web designer and a content management system rolled into one platform.

What sets Webflow apart is its approach to website creation. While WordPress relies on themes and plugins, Webflow gives you complete visual control over every pixel. You're not just picking from pre-made templates ‚Äì you're essentially becoming the designer of your own digital space.

The platform has evolved significantly in 2025, introducing enhanced CMS performance, AI-powered optimization tools, and improved collaboration features. According to recent updates from Webflow Conf 2025, the platform now positions itself as the first ""Website Experience Platform,"" expanding beyond simple website building to include powerful analytics and optimization tools.

For bloggers, this means you're not just getting a place to publish content ‚Äì you're getting a complete digital experience toolkit. The question is: do you actually need all that power, or would you be better served by something simpler?

# Webflow's Blogging Arsenal: Features That Matter üí™

Let's talk about what Webflow brings to the blogging table. The platform's CMS capabilities have received major upgrades in 2025, and honestly, some of these features are pretty impressive.

# Visual Content Management

The standout feature is Webflow's **visual CMS approach**. Instead of writing posts in a basic text editor and hoping they look good on the frontend, you get real-time visual editing. Double-click any text element on your blog post, and you can edit it directly on the page. It's like having the simplicity of Medium's editor but with complete design control.

# Dynamic Content Capabilities

Webflow's Collections system lets you create custom content types beyond standard blog posts. Want to add author profiles, portfolio pieces, or product reviews with unique layouts? You can build these as separate collections and dynamically link them to your blog posts. This flexibility is something traditional blogging platforms struggle to match.

# Built-in SEO Tools

The platform includes robust SEO features that auto-generate meta titles and descriptions based on your content. You can customize URL structures, add alt tags to images, and use dynamic SEO data that pulls from your CMS fields. The new Audit panel helps identify and fix SEO issues before you publish, which is a nice touch for content creators focused on organic growth.

# Performance and Hosting

Webflow's hosting infrastructure is optimized for speed, with built-in CDN, automatic backups, and SSL certificates. In 2025, they've enhanced their CMS performance, allowing for faster publishing and better handling of content-heavy sites. This means your blog posts load quickly, which both readers and search engines appreciate.

# Advanced Interactions and Animations

Here's where Webflow really shines: you can add sophisticated animations and interactions to your blog posts without touching code. Want a smooth scroll effect or an animated image gallery? It's all built into the platform.

# The Bright Side: Why Bloggers Love Webflow ‚ú®

After researching user experiences and testing the platform myself, here are the reasons why many bloggers are genuinely excited about Webflow:

# Complete Design Freedom

The biggest advantage is **creative control**. You're not limited by theme constraints or worried about your site looking like everyone else's. If you can imagine it, you can probably build it in Webflow. This is particularly appealing for bloggers who view their website as an extension of their personal or professional brand.

# Professional Appearance Without the Price Tag

Hiring a custom web designer can cost thousands of dollars. Webflow lets you achieve that custom, professional look yourself. Many users report creating blogs that rival expensive custom designs, which is especially valuable for freelancers, agencies, and creative professionals who need to make a strong visual impression.

# All-in-One Solution

Instead of juggling multiple tools for design, hosting, analytics, and content management, Webflow consolidates everything into one platform. This can actually save money and time in the long run, despite the higher upfront cost.

# Scalability and Growth

As your blog grows, Webflow grows with you. The platform handles everything from simple personal blogs to complex business websites with thousands of pages. The enhanced CMS limits in 2025 mean you can manage substantial amounts of content without performance issues.

# Learning and Skill Development

Many users find that working with Webflow actually teaches them web design principles. Unlike other platforms where you just fill in templates, Webflow encourages you to understand design fundamentals. This knowledge becomes valuable whether you stick with blogging or expand into other digital projects.

# The Reality Check: Webflow's Limitations for Bloggers ‚ö†Ô∏è

Now for the honest conversation about where Webflow falls short for blogging. These limitations are important to consider because they might be deal-breakers depending on your specific needs.

# Cost Considerations

Let's address the elephant in the room: **Webflow is expensive** compared to traditional blogging platforms. The CMS plan, which you'll need for blogging, starts at a significantly higher price point than WordPress hosting or even premium Squarespace plans. For hobbyist bloggers or those just starting out, this cost can be prohibitive.

# Learning Curve Challenges

While Webflow is more intuitive than coding from scratch, it's definitely more complex than WordPress or other traditional blogging platforms. New users often report feeling overwhelmed by the interface and the number of design options available. If you just want to write and publish quickly, this complexity might slow you down.

# Mobile Editing Limitations

Here's a practical issue that frustrates many users: **you can't edit your blog through a mobile app**. All content management must be done through a desktop browser. For bloggers who like to write on-the-go or make quick edits from their phone, this is a significant limitation in 2025.

# Data and Table Restrictions

If your blog content involves a lot of data, statistics, or complex tables, Webflow isn't ideal. While you can create grids and basic layouts, the platform lacks robust table creation features. This makes it less suitable for technical blogs, research content, or data-heavy niches.

# Third-Party Integration Complexity

While Webflow has improved its integration capabilities, connecting with certain third-party tools (especially niche blogging tools or specific marketing platforms) can be more complex than with WordPress. The plugin ecosystem is much smaller, which might limit your ability to add specific functionality.

# Head-to-Head: Webflow vs. Traditional Blogging Platforms ü•ä

To help you make an informed decision, here's how Webflow stacks up against the most popular blogging alternatives:

# Webflow vs. WordPress

**WordPress wins on**: Cost-effectiveness, plugin ecosystem, mobile editing, community support, and flexibility for complex functionality.

**Webflow wins on**: Design control, hosting simplicity, security (no plugin vulnerabilities), performance optimization, and learning curve for non-technical users who want custom designs.

# Webflow vs. Squarespace

**Squarespace wins on**: Simplicity, cost, mobile app editing, and speed of setup.

**Webflow wins on**: Design flexibility, customization options, advanced interactions, and scalability for complex projects.

# Webflow vs. Ghost

**Ghost wins on**: Publishing focus, simplicity, cost, and built-in membership features.

**Webflow wins on**: Visual design capabilities, all-in-one solution, and advanced layout options.

The choice really comes down to your priorities. If you value design control and are willing to invest time and money to achieve a truly custom look, Webflow is compelling. If you prioritize simplicity, cost-effectiveness, or specific blogging features, traditional platforms might serve you better.

# Who Should (and Shouldn't) Choose Webflow üéØ

Based on my research and analysis, here's my honest assessment of who Webflow serves best:

# Webflow is Excellent For:

* **Creative professionals** (designers, photographers, artists) who want their blog to showcase their aesthetic sensibilities
* **Agencies and consultants** who need a professional web presence that reflects their expertise
* **Business blogs** where design and brand consistency are crucial
* **Content creators** who want to experiment with interactive content and unique layouts
* **Bloggers with some technical aptitude** who enjoy learning new tools and don't mind a steeper learning curve

# Webflow Probably Isn't Right For:

* **Budget-conscious beginners** who need to minimize upfront costs
* **High-volume content publishers** who prioritize speed and efficiency over design customization
* **Mobile-first bloggers** who need to write and edit frequently from their phones
* **Data-heavy content creators** who regularly publish complex tables and statistical content
* **Bloggers who prefer simplicity** and just want to focus on writing without thinking about design

# Final Verdict: Making the Right Choice üèÜ

So, is Webflow good for blogs? The answer is a qualified **yes** ‚Äì but with important caveats.

**Webflow excels when your blog is part of a larger brand strategy** and when visual presentation is crucial to your success. If you're building a blog that needs to impress clients, showcase creative work, or serve as a professional calling card, Webflow's design capabilities justify the investment.

However, if you're primarily focused on content creation, community building, or cost-effective publishing, traditional blogging platforms will probably serve you better. WordPress, Ghost, or even Squarespace might be more aligned with your actual needs.

My recommendation? **Start with your goals, not the platform**. Ask yourself:

* How important is visual customization to your success?
* Do you have the budget and time to invest in learning a more complex tool?
* Will design flexibility actually help you achieve your blogging objectives?

If you answered ""very important,"" ""yes,"" and ""absolutely"" ‚Äì then Webflow deserves serious consideration. The 2025 updates have addressed many previous limitations, and the platform continues to evolve in blogger-friendly directions.

For everyone else, there's no shame in choosing a simpler, more cost-effective solution. The best blogging platform is the one you'll actually use consistently to create great content. Sometimes that means choosing the tool that gets out of your way, not the one with the most features.

**The bottom line**: Webflow is a powerful choice for bloggers who value design control and are willing to invest in learning a sophisticated platform. Just make sure that sophistication aligns with your actual blogging goals before taking the plunge.",1,1749132527.0,NoCodeCommunity,0,1.0,False

1l401sk,https://i.redd.it/qrb8xdff845f1.jpeg,An ebook reader that works (sort of),"This is Xodo, ‚ÄúAll PDF Editor & Reader.‚Äù It is the first reader I‚Äôve found that will rotate documents. So, it works, but is not without inconveniences. I‚Äôll outline them here.

1. When you open the app for the first time, there‚Äôs no way to use it without signing up for a 3-day trial period followed by a $61 one-year subscription for advanced features. Basic features like simply reading documents are supposed to be free, so PLEASE, PLEASE go to your ‚ÄúPayments and Subscriptions‚Äù menu is Google Play, and cancel within the trial period.

2. It‚Äôs a PDF reader, and does not support ePub or Kindle formats. So, you will need to convert your documents before sideloading them. In Calibre, I set my output profile as ‚ÄúPocketbook Inkpad 3 (Pro) and X,‚Äù because this profile has the same 1404x1872 screen resolution of the OKPad. More experimentation to come.

3. You cannot set it up to universally work in portrait mode. Every book will have to be rotated after it is opened. Tap in the middle of the screen to open the menu, and set the configuration in the upper-left to ‚ÄúView.‚Äù Then tap the icon showing a page with a gear inside, set Viewing Mode to ‚ÄúSingle,‚Äù toggle ‚ÄúVertical Scrolling‚Äù to OFF, and select the ‚ÄúRotate Clockwise Action THREE TIMES (see next step for explanation of why).

1l401ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1l401ql/sovereign_city_echo_protocol_chapter_4_a_breath/,[Sovereign City: Echo Protocol] Chapter 4: A Breath Between Heartbeats,"The hum of the R&D sublevels was constant - airflow, pressure gates, the distant whir of drone treads against polished flooring.

Nova had grown used to the rhythm. It was the kind of background noise that became a comfort over time, like the tick of an old engine you didn't need to fix because you already knew its song.

A mug of synth-coffee steamed beside her datapad, untouched. Better than the coolant-y one from before. The light in the corridor was soft and even, tinted with that faint teal-ish hue they used in the lower labs to reduce eye strain and anxiety. Here, in this pocket of engineered calm, the world felt¬†*almost human.*

She leaned against the frame of the lab door, one boot scuffing idly about as she waited for the calibration to finish. Another test sequence. Another patch fix. Another line of code dropped into a machine she no longer fully trusted.

She hadn't talked to anyone about the interface. Not about the voice. Not about the memory that wasn't hers. Not about how it felt like something had looked back at her from inside the system. How could she?

*""You are almost finished.""*

Nova blinked the thought away. She was tired of asking questions she didn't have clearance to answer. But before more thoughts could organize, they were interrupted by a distant roar; growing stronger in strength.

Fast. Sharp. Frantic.

The rhythmic clatter of emergency treads and synthetic comms chirping in escalating urgency. She turned her head just as the corridor lit with overhead strobes - procession of medical transport approaching, flanked by two stabilization drones and a surgical escort team moving at a dead sprint.

They passed her lab door in a blur, and that's when she saw him. The body strapped to the gurney wasn't just wounded - it was ruined. Skin fused to ceramic shards. Breath shallow. Magnetic core exposed, sparking faintly against an open sternum. But what stopped her wasn't the gore.

It was the luminescant pattern etched beneath the exposed plating on his shoulder; a latticework of augmented connective tissue so specific, so elegant, it could only have come from one place.¬†*Herself.*

""No!"" she gasped, pushing through the door. ""Wait, that's my - ! Those were never meant for field deployment! - ""

She chased them down the hall, nearly colliding with the rear drone as she caught up. One of the medics glanced back. ""We're taking him to the Fabrication Wing.""

Nova looked again. The augment framework was definitely hers, but modified, overclocked, weaponized far beyond its original intent.¬†*Who had done this to him?*¬†And more urgently -¬†*had she done this to him, without ever knowing his name?*

She ran beside the gurney now, close enough to see his face. He was mostly unconscious, with only brief, terrible bouts of cognition. His eyes flickered. One opened, just slightly. The iris lagged, like it had to remember how to focus. He looked at her.

""Kiera?"" he rasped, weak as static.

Nova blinked. ""No,"" she said quietly, voice catching. ""Nova. Nova Cale.""

His lips didn't move, but his breath hitched. Recognition or relief, she didn't know. Not too shortly after that, his head slumped, and the monitors spiked, just as they turned the corner into the Fabrication Wing.

This was Calyx's sanctum.

The lighting had changed; warmer, but still clinical - refracted through bio-gel panels designed to soothe cortical stress. There were no doors here. Only pressure fields and isolation bands.

But Calyx was already waiting.

She stood at the center of a circular surgical platform, feminine in silhouette, but so very obviously inhuman. Her posture was perfect. Movements delibrate. Her face was carved with smooth, symmetrical planes; too exact to be mistaken for natural beauty, too poised to be purely mechanical. She was sentient.

Her eyes were not traditional eyes. They were adjustable oscillators, multi-spectrum apertures that tracked micro-tremors and nerve latency like a musician reading sheet music. Calyx stood at the edge of the surgical dais as they presented his remains. With one hand pressed gently against Caelus Drae's shattered chest, she analyzed his body. Her fingers were long and meticulate. Not spiderlike, simply more precise. Crafted. Built to touch without error.

Nova watched from behind the transparent barrier, body tight with worry but eyes refusing to blink.

""He's cerrrrrtainly not stable,"" Calyx said, her voice whispy and poetic. ""Internal temperature below survivable range. Multiple stress shears. The muscular lattice has collapsed in four quadrants.""

Her voice came from¬†*four places at once.*¬†Nova turned her head. The other Calyx units - three standing at control stations, one seated behind a fabricator arm, were perfectly synchronized. Hive-stitched consciousness was shared across all of them like memory through a relay. She was the only sentient one however, her clones merely extensions of her mind and Synthetic body.

""So... what are you saying?"" Nova asked, too tense.

Calyx didn't respond immediately. Instead, she leaned closer to Caelus's exposed torso, eye modules flickering across various wavelength spectra.

""I'm saying he's¬†*beautifully broken,*"" she said, almost reverently. ""And if I repair him, it will be the most sophisticated restoration of augmented tissue in post-Accord history."" She turned. ""You brought me a masterpiece in pieces.¬†*I accept.*""

The table lowered into position. The lights above shifted to surgical white, pressed against a bioreactive filter. The other Calyx bodies moved like instruments brought to life; adjusting, syncing, configuring environmental tolerances.

One Calyx placed a nanite syringe against the side of Caelus's neck. A tiny hiss escaped. ""Nociceptor disruption is underway."" that Calyx said. ""Pain transmission suspended.""

Another waved a hand over his thigh with a flowerly gesture. Nano-sutures danced beneath the skin, knitting torn fiber back into cohesion. ""Initiating cellular proliferation,"" said a third. ""Stage one: muscular regrowth. Phase time: 11 minutes.""

Caelus twitched. His lips parted in reflex. His brain registered the tearing of his own cells becoming whole again... but the pain never arrived.

Calyx watched his readouts calmly. ""He would be screaming if not for the disruption to his pain receptors. His cells are now multiplying and dividing quicker than theyre consuming energy. Rapid regeneration is... traumatic. We prefer not to remind them.""

From the back of the chamber, the fourth Calyx oversaw the fabrication unit. Augments were being printed in real-time, designed from scratch to replace the internal structures lost in the blast. Nova stepped closer to the barrier.

""You're designing new ones?""

""No,"" Calyx said. ""I'm designing¬†*better*¬†ones. What he had was... crude. Optimized for destruction, not recovery.""

She glanced at Nova - not unkind, but clinical. ""If he survives, it will not be because of what he was. It will be because of what I've made him.""

Nova didn't respond. Not with words. She just watched - hoping this wasn't the last time she'd see him breathe.

Calyx's four bodies continued to work in a flurry of controlled elegance, each tireslessly a reflection of the same unified thought. But the one closest to Nova was smiling now, or at least doing the best approximation of a smile that a synthetic face could manage without appearing either predatory or in pain.

""I do love a man in pieces,"" Calyx said brightly, delicately lifting a severed augmentation spindle as if it were a fine tea cup. ""So much potential. So little coordination.""

Nova blinked. ""Is that... supposed to be comforting?""

One of the other Calyxes, the one at the far fabrication station, turned just slightly. ""She finds humans respond better when confused.""

""More pliable,"" added the one at the medical console.

""More fun,"" said the first, tossing the spindle into a recycling hopper with a musical¬†*ping*.

Nova crossed her arms, unsure whether to be impressed or concerned. ""You're a battlefield medic operative, sure. But what else? Surely you dont need multiple bodies just for that?""

""I'm the¬†*best*¬†battlefield medic,"" Calyx replied with a curtsey too precise to be organic. ""Also the worst baker, third-best linguist, and a disgraceful tap dancer. But healing? Healing I do¬†*exceptionally.*""

She turned back to Caelus's partially reconstructed frame, her voice lowering into something reverent.

""You see, this man was built to break. Violent and surgical, these elite operatives are mostly the same. 'Damage Dealers' to put it bluntly. But this..."" she traced a finger across the edge of his exposed sternum, where nanite scaffolding had begun weaving itself into new armor-like ridges, ""...this will make him¬†*last.*""

Calyx wasn't just healing Caelus.

She was remaking him.

The augment schematics floated in the air, cast from her internal frame projectors - lines of geometric force-distribution matrices and overcharged shielding nodes. The designs were massive, layered in a way Nova had never seen before. There were heat venting arrays, staggered kinetic buffers, threat-magnetizers, and - Nova narrowed her eyes - a redirection array.

""You're building him to... take hits?"" Nova asked.

""To¬†*invite*¬†them,"" Calyx replied cheerfully. ""The Ascendents always think in terms of output. Firepower. Alpha strike. But that's not what a field needs. A field needs¬†*weight.*¬†A center. Someone the chaos clings to.""

A fourth Calyx chimed in, scanning muscle regeneration progress: ""Aggro profile optimization at 74%. Projected enemy prioritization high.""

Nova raised an eyebrow. ""You're making him a threat magnet?""

Calyx grinned. ""Well. If you're going to be the last thing standing, you might as well be interesting.""

The restoration wasn't gentle.

Despite the nociceptor disruptors keeping Caelus's nerves from screaming, the strain on his system was enormous. The nanites themselves operated like hive-minded surgeons, crawling through his blood, replicating healthy tissue at impossible speed. Every micron of his body was being rewritten. Bones thickened. Augment ports rebalanced. Nerve channels expanded to allow faster shielding reflexes.

But none of it looked painful. Calyx's precision saw to that.

""You know,"" she said, flipping a scalpel between her fingers like a conductor's baton, ""you could have brought me someone¬†*boring.*¬†A broken Purist. A crushed Sovereign. But no - you bring me a legend with a blown-out frame and enough internal trauma to make a priest cry. This is a¬†*treat.*""

Nova stared at the projection. ""He'll be able to walk?""

Calyx spun on a heel. ""He'll be able to¬†*carry cities.*""

Nova stepped out into the corridor and let the door seal behind her. The silence crept in like a subtle pressure - clean, quiet, and sterile. She leaned back against the warm bio-gel paneling and exhaled hard, finally releasing a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding since his body came careening through hall like a dying prophecy. Her hands shook, just slightly. Adrenaline, she told herself. Nothing more.

The corridor smelled faintly of ionizing mist from the operations. Somewhere nearby, a ventilation duct clicked with soft acknowledgement.

""Caelus Drae,"" came the voice behind her.

Nova turned. One of the Calyxes - impossible for her to tell which one - with a faintly pearlescent facial plating and a ribbon of cobalt threading through her synthetic hair, had snuck in beside her, arms folded, expression unreadable.

""Tier Three Elite. Ascendent field operative:¬†*Sentinel Class.*¬†Solo combatant. Full threat capabilities, responsive shielding, forward-pressure control.¬†*One Hunnnnndred percent*¬†mission completion. Unbroken."" She gave a theatrical little shrug, like reading off a menu. ""And yet... there he lies. Cracked open like cheap circuitry and bleeding out onto my floor.""

Calyx paced with slow, effortless grace, boots making no sound. She traced a circle in the air with one gloved finger as if writing invisible glyphs.

""I don't believe in coincidence. I believe in orchestration. And this? This feels... discordant.""

Nova raised an eyebrow. ""You're saying he was set up?""

Calyx spun to face her with the loose-limbed twirl of someone who had once studied ballet for the express purpose of making war seem graceful. ""Oh no, my dear. I'm saying someone¬†*knew*¬†he might not come back, and sent him anyway. And that means one of two things: our operators are being used like chess pieces..."" She paused, grinning faintly. ""...or more like sacrificial runes.""

Nova swallowed. The weight of Calyx's gaze made her feel both seen and scanned. She looked away, then back again. ""You seem pretty confident in your intel.""

""Please. I'm a war-clinic with legs and a broadband uplink. I read between everything."" Calyx's head tilted, like a bird hearing something behind the walls. ""Who's his handler?"" she asked softly.

Nova hesitated. ""I... I don't know. I didn't even know his name before today.""

""Mmm. Tragic. But useful.""

Calyx began walking again, slow, gliding steps down the hall, speaking over her shoulder like someone narrating a play only she had seen to the end. ""I know who probably knows. And I think it's time we paid him a visit.""

Nova blinked. ""Who?""

Calyx stopped. Turned, and smiled like the moon shining down on a battlefield.

""My good friend...¬†*Maxim Cutter.*""

Hey fellow content creators! üéâ

Have you ever had that moment where you felt the world zooming by, and you're just trying to keep up? Let's face it‚ÄîAI is taking over faster than my coffee-fueled Monday mornings. ‚òï If we don‚Äôt level up our skills NOW, we might find ourselves left in the dust, watching everyone else snag the dream jobs while we‚Äôre still stuck figuring out how to use the printer. 

**So, how do we ride this AI wave instead of getting wiped out?** 

Here are some must-have AI skills that can really help you pay the bills:

- **AI Content Creation**: Yep, it‚Äôs not just about writing anymore. Learn how to use AI tools to craft better, faster, and more engaging content. Imagine hitting ""generate"" and having a draft ready to refine. Isn‚Äôt that wild? 

- **SEO Savvy**: Knowing how AI can optimize your content for search engines is key. Get comfy with terms like ""natural language processing"" and ""semantic search."" Your future self will thank you when your posts start landing on page one!

- **Data Analysis**: Don't run away! Data sounds boring, but with AI-driven tools, it doesn‚Äôt have to be. Understanding basic data analysis can help you make informed decisions and really elevate your content strategy. Plus, it makes you sound super smart in meetings! üìä

- **Automation Basics**: Who doesn‚Äôt love a little automation, right? Learning to automate repetitive tasks frees up time for *the fun stuff*, like brainstorming new ideas or actually enjoying a lunch break. üëÄ 

And here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äî**investing in your skills pays off.** I recently checked out this [educational program](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) that dives deep into AI skills for creators. It‚Äôs like having a cheat sheet in this AI game! Seriously, the stuff I learned got me thinking about all the potential I had been sitting on for years.

But here‚Äôs where it gets real‚Äîwhat happens if we don‚Äôt adapt? Imagine being the last flip phone owner in a world full of iPhones. üò≥ Yikes, right? Or worse, missing out on opportunities because we didn‚Äôt evolve with the times. 

So, what are you waiting for? It's time to embrace AI, level up, and, heck, even have a little fun in the process! 

What has your experience been with AI so far? Are there any roadblocks you‚Äôre facing, or tips you have up your sleeve to share with the crew? üëá Let‚Äôs chat!",1,1749132270.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Two days ago, I went to start the car in the morning, and it started up fine. However, upon putting the vehicle into Drive, the engine stalled. I started the car back up, and it ran fine. I was able to get coffee and return home. 

Later that day, when I started it again, the engine started but instantly died. I tried starting again, but it was hesitant, just like the video of the cold start. 



The vehicle, at times, runs fine and can drive, but it will stall randomly again. The videos are the worst of it. I've been trying to figure out the issue ever since. After a cold start, the car will warm up at 1.5k RPM for a minute or so before the RPM-dropping symptoms begin.



The battery and alternator have both been tested to 14.5V charging at idle and 12.6V with the engine off and checked for any apparent air or vacuum leaks. 

I ran the vehicle without the MAF plugged in as a test and still experienced the RPM jumping symptom, as seen in video #2. However, the car did not stall, and the idle subsided presumably when it reached operating temperature.



Approximately 600-700 km ago, I experienced a P0335 Crankshaft Position 'A' Circuit Malfunction CEL, which I resolved by replacing the CKPS with an OEM part and recalibrating it from an independent mechanic. Could this be the issue?

## Key Features Analysis

The Hamilton Beach coffee grinder lineup boasts a variety of features designed to cater to different needs and preferences. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting the grinder that best suits your individual requirements.

**Durable Blades:**
Many Hamilton Beach coffee grinders are equipped with durable stainless steel blades. These blades are designed to efficiently grind coffee beans to the desired consistency.The stainless steel construction ensures longevity and resistance to corrosion, making them easy to clean and maintain. The blade design focuses on even grinding for optimal flavor extraction.

**Grind Consistency:**
While blade grinders don't offer the same level of consistency as burr grinders, Hamilton Beach models strive to provide a uniform grind. The grind consistency can vary depending on the duration of the grinding process. A longer grinding time typically results in a finer grind, while a shorter duration yields a coarser grind.

**Capacity:**
Hamilton Beach coffee grinders offer varying capacities to accommodate different brewing needs. Some models are designed to grind enough coffee for a single cup, while others can grind enough for a full pot.The capacity is typically measured in cups or ounces of coffee beans.Larger capacity grinders are ideal for households with multiple coffee drinkers or for those who frequently entertain guests.

**One-Touch Operation:**
Many Hamilton Beach coffee grinders feature a user-pleasant one-touch operation. This simplifies the grinding process, allowing you to start grinding with the push of a button. The one-touch operation provides convenience and ease of use, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.

**Hidden Cord Storage:**
Several Hamilton Beach coffee grinders include a hidden cord storage compartment. This feature helps to keep your countertops clutter-free and organized.The hidden cord storage allows you to neatly tuck away the power cord when the grinder is not in use.

**Removable Grinding Chamber:**
Some models have a removable grinding chamber designed for easy cleaning and maintenance. This feature allows you to thoroughly clean the grinding chamber without having to disassemble the entire grinder. The removable chamber also allows you to easily pour the ground coffee into your coffee maker or storage container.

## Core Benefits

Choosing a Hamilton Beach coffee grinder can bring several advantages to your daily coffee routine. These benefits extend beyond simply grinding beans, impacting flavor, convenience, and overall value.

**Freshly Ground Coffee:** grinding your own coffee beans right before brewing ensures maximum flavor and aroma. Pre-ground coffee loses its flavor over time, while freshly ground coffee delivers a richer, more vibrant taste. The Hamilton Beach coffee grinder allows you to enjoy the full potential of your favorite coffee beans.

**Customizable Grind Size:** While most Hamilton Beach grinders are blade grinders and don't offer precise grind settings, you can still control the grind size by adjusting the grinding time. This allows you to customize the grind to suit your preferred brewing method, whether it's drip, French press, or espresso. Experimenting with different grinding times can definitely help you achieve the perfect cup of coffee.

**Cost-Effective:** Grinding your own beans is frequently enough more cost-effective than buying pre-ground coffee. Whole bean coffee typically costs less per pound than pre-ground, and you have the flexibility to grind only what you need. Over time, the savings can add up, making a Hamilton Beach coffee grinder a worthwhile investment.

**Convenience:** Having a coffee grinder at home provides the convenience of freshly ground coffee whenever you want it. You no longer need to make trips to the coffee shop or rely on pre-ground coffee that might potentially be stale. The hamilton Beach coffee grinder puts the power of fresh coffee in your hands, allowing you to enjoy a tasty cup whenever the mood strikes.**Versatility:** Beyond coffee beans, Hamilton Beach grinders can also be used to grind other spices and nuts.This makes them a versatile addition to any kitchen. You can grind spices for cooking, nuts for baking, or even flax seeds for added nutrition. However, avoid grinding oily nuts as this will cause damage to the unit.

## FAQs Section

**Can a Hamilton Beach coffee grinder grind spices?**

Yes, many Hamilton Beach coffee grinders can be used to grind spices. However, it's recommended to dedicate a separate grinder for spices to avoid flavor contamination. Thoroughly clean the grinder after each use to prevent cross-contamination between spices and coffee.

**How do I clean my Hamilton Beach coffee grinder?**

The grinding time depends on the desired grind size and the model of the grinder. Start with a short grinding time (e.g., 10-15 seconds) for a coarse grind and increase the time for a finer grind. Experiment with different grinding times to find the perfect setting for your preferred brewing method.

I know very well this does not matter in jee but just want to tell you so you may help me(sorry for wrong English). I have always been a topper ever since class 5th to last preboard of class 10th (yes I was not able to achieve my aim in class 10th of 98+ % I got 97.2) I could not make my parents and grandparents feel proud. I studies till 2-3 at night before and during my board exam. I used to keep my self forcefully awake by drinking bitter black coffee just for studying. I have been a devotee of krishna all through my class 10th but now I cannot bring my self to praying to my god. When ever I am infront of my home temple I just say to god 'thank you for whatever you gave me' but I can't bring myself to pray or ask for anything from him because I can't trust anymore, I have lost my faith. It is not that I hate my god but it is just that I don't feel as close to him now as I Used to.

I got to know recently my father is a drunkard and have been from 1995. It was around late April when I was fighting with my jee backlogs when I saw him vomiting and my grandfather with tears in his eyes told me ""Tumahre mammi tumhare papa ko pilati hai"". My father hit my mother very frequently (if she does not do what he askes he will hit her more), but the drinking part I did not know about. I cannot put in words what I have gone through the past month. I was not able to breath around 1 to 2 pm in the evening and I think those were anxiety attacks,My heart would feel like stopping and palm would swet and feet would become cold. My father is not very educated and I always fear what if he stops my study what will I do. I don't want to be married and get hit by my husband like my mother. I have talked to my father about his drinking infront of my whole family he said he is not a drunkard he drinks occasionally. He has OCD though he does not accepted, mammi se hamesha apna hath (hand) dhulvate rehte hai, aur Kuchh unke according na ho to mammi ko marte hai.

Since I have a dummy school and I study from home I ask him not to shout but he occasionally listens and always speaks loudly which makes me very anxious. I have started to hate him but do not get angry infront of him only because what if he does not let me study.

I just want to get good rank in jee and get out of this mess. I am unable to focus in class. My Maths and Physics are going well but I feel lost and I don't think I am doing enough for jee. I have talked to my teachers and they are very kind I could not hold back my tear while on call with them. My chemistry is messed up badly. I don't have backlog in maths and physics but mole concept, atomic structure (partially) and periodic table is completely in backlog, currently chemical bonding is going on and I am unable to gain confidence.

I have lost my hope, my krishna, my peace but I Don't want to be lost. I want to live with freedom. Please guide me I don't want to waste my jee Years. My father won't let me take a drop. Please help me. Please tell me how should I complete my backlog. How should I remember what I study. Upto class 10th it was just that you have an NCERT ,study it and you are done but jee is different. Please, I don't want to waste my life, I don't want to be physical hurt by my husband when I grow up just because i don't have a career and depend on him for money (just like my mom). I cry daily at night, I pinch my self that my skin becomes red and bleeds, I slap myself while studying and when. No one is around, and I want to kill myself but my condition is better than a lot of people on reddit whose father drink only and those who have very bad health or bad finance that they cannot even study. I want my Kanha back I love him and only him but I don't know what I have done wrong that he does not love me. Please I don't want to be a failure, I will deal with my personal life anyhow but please guide me for my jee prep. Please I beg. Thank you.

The endless expanse of snow-capped peaks stretching into infinity made my heart skip a beat‚Äîand that was just the beginning. After multiple trips to the Last Frontier and countless conversations with fellow travelers who've fallen under Alaska's spell, I can tell you that this magnificent state offers some of the most breathtaking experiences on Earth.

Alaska isn't just a destination; it's a transformative journey that awakens something primal within you. Whether you're watching grizzly bears fish for salmon, standing before a glacier that's been around since before civilization, or witnessing the **northern lights** dance across an ink-black sky, Alaska has this magical way of making you feel simultaneously humbled and exhilarated.

# Gateway Cities: Your Alaska Adventure Begins

# Anchorage: Where Urban Meets Wild

Anchorage serves as the perfect introduction to Alaska, offering big-city amenities with wilderness literally at your doorstep. I remember stepping out of my hotel in downtown Anchorage and being amazed that I could see the towering peaks of the Chugach Mountains while still being surrounded by restaurants, museums, and shops.

The city strikes this incredible balance between civilization and untamed nature. You can start your morning with a latte from a trendy coffee shop, spend your afternoon hiking in **Chugach State Park**, and end your day watching for beluga whales along the **Tony Knowles Coastal Trail**. Within an hour or two from town, you could be kayaking among icebergs, watching brown bears in the wild, or hiking through a rainforest or alpine meadow.

**Must-do experiences in Anchorage:**

* Take a scenic drive along Turnagain Arm to spot Dall sheep and beluga whales
* Visit the **Alaska Native Heritage Center** to learn about Indigenous cultures
* Explore the Anchorage Museum for fascinating exhibits on Alaska's history
* Try your hand at flightseeing tours that take you over glaciers and mountain peaks

# Fairbanks: Land of the Midnight Sun

Travel to Fairbanks in the summer to experience the legendary midnight sun, a phenomenon where the sun shines nearly all day, or visit in winter for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the northern lights. There's something almost surreal about playing softball at midnight under natural sunlight, or conversely, watching the aurora borealis paint the winter sky in ethereal greens and purples.

Fairbanks offers a more rugged, frontier feel compared to Anchorage. The **University of Alaska Museum of the North** houses incredible collections of Alaska Native artifacts and natural history exhibits that help you understand this complex land. Don't miss the **Chena River State Recreation Area** for outdoor adventures, and if you're visiting in winter, the **Chena Hot Springs** provide a perfect way to warm up while potentially catching the northern lights overhead.

# Alaska's Crown Jewel National Parks

# Denali National Park: Home of the High One

At 20,310ft (6194 m), starting at almost sea level, Denali is the tallest mountain in the world, measured from its base to summit. But Denali National Park offers so much more than just its famous peak. This is where Alaska's wilderness truly comes alive.

The park has just one road, and private vehicles can only drive a short portion of it in summer. Most sightseeing in Denali is done by bus tours, which initially might sound limiting, but trust me‚Äîit's actually perfect. These buses are like mobile wildlife safaris. I've spotted caribou, grizzly bears, Dall sheep, and golden eagles all from the comfort of a park bus, with knowledgeable drivers who know exactly where to stop for the best wildlife viewing.

**Pro tip:** Book your bus tour tickets and accommodation long before your visit! In the summer, Denali NP is a very busy place, and the narrated tours are usually sold out long before the season starts.

The **Tundra Wilderness Tour** is absolutely worth the investment. It's a 5-6 hour narrated tour that offers the best opportunities for wildlife viewing in Denali National Park. The landscape transitions from dense spruce forests to open tundra, and on clear days, the views of Denali itself are simply breathtaking.

# Glacier Bay National Park: A World Sculpted by Ice

Lofty mountain peaks, ice-sculpted fjords, an abundance of marine wildlife, and massive tidewater glaciers have made Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve one of Alaska's most spectacular settings. This UNESCO World Heritage Site feels like stepping into a different era entirely.

Although getting here is a bit of a challenge (there is no road access in or out of the park), the sheer beauty of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve makes the journey more than worth it. Most visitors experience Glacier Bay as part of an Alaska cruise, but if you can swing it, I highly recommend flying into Gustavus and staying at Bartlett Cove for a more intimate experience.

The **wildlife viewing** here is phenomenal. Humpback whales migrate thousands of miles from their tropical breeding grounds to feed in the nutrient-rich waters of Alaska. Visitors often witness humpbacks breaching, lobtailing, and bubble-net feeding‚Äîa cooperative hunting technique that showcases their intelligence and coordination. I watched in awe as a pod of humpbacks performed their synchronized feeding dance, creating a wall of bubbles to trap their prey.

**What makes Glacier Bay special:**

* Over 1,000 glaciers in a 3.3-million-acre park
* Incredible marine wildlife including whales, sea lions, and sea otters
* The thunderous sound of glaciers calving into the sea
* Pristine temperate rainforest hiking trails

# Coastal Adventures and Marine Wonders

# Seward and Kenai Fjords: Gateway to Glacial Wonders

Fed by nearly 40 glaciers flowing from the Harding Icefield, Kenai Fjords National Park tops the list of many Alaskan itineraries. Seward, the charming gateway town, sits beautifully on Resurrection Bay and serves as the launching point for some of Alaska's most spectacular boat tours.

The **Kenai Fjords boat tours** are absolutely magical. Picture this: you're gliding through emerald waters surrounded by towering cliffs, when suddenly a massive chunk of glacier ice crashes into the sea with a sound like thunder. The boat rocks gently from the waves created by the ""calving"" ice, and everyone on deck gasps in wonder. It's moments like these that make Alaska unforgettable.

Seward itself is a delightful town to explore. The **Alaska SeaLife Center** provides fascinating insights into marine ecosystems, and the hiking trails around the area offer stunning views of the Kenai Peninsula's dramatic landscape.

# The Inside Passage: Alaska's Scenic Marine Highway

Visit a glacier in Juneau, ride a narrow-gauge train in Skagway, go fishing in Ketchikan, and find plenty more fun in Alaska ports of call. The Inside Passage cruise route showcases Alaska's coastal beauty like nothing else.

Each port town has its own distinct personality. **Juneau**, Alaska's capital, offers the famous Mendenhall Glacier and excellent hiking trails. **Ketchikan** is known for its incredible totem pole collections and rich Alaska Native heritage. **Skagway** tells the story of the gold rush era with its historic downtown and the thrilling White Pass Railroad.

The journey between ports is just as spectacular as the destinations themselves. Cruising through the **Lynn Canal** or **Stephens Passage**, you're constantly scanning the water for whale spouts or eagles soaring overhead. The inside waters are protected from ocean swells, making for smooth sailing and incredible photography opportunities.

# Unique Alaska Experiences You Can't Miss

# Northern Lights Viewing

You will be rewarded with magnificent glaciers, rich Native American culture and breathtaking views of the aurora borealis (best seen between August and April). There's absolutely nothing like witnessing the aurora borealis dance across the star-filled Alaska sky.

I spent one incredible September night near Fairbanks, bundled up in a warm parka, watching ribbons of green and purple light undulate across the heavens. The silence was profound, broken only by the occasional whisper of wind and my own amazed gasps. It's a spiritual experience that photographs simply cannot capture.

# Wildlife Encounters in Their Natural Habitat

Alaska's wildlife viewing opportunities are unparalleled. Visitors can take in stunning views of mountains and glaciers, spot wildlife like moose and bears, and explore the state's rich natural history. Whether it's watching brown bears fishing for salmon at **Katmai National Park**, observing the massive Kodiak bears on **Kodiak Island**, or spotting caribou migrations in the Arctic, Alaska offers wildlife experiences found nowhere else on Earth.

The key to successful wildlife viewing is patience and the right timing. Early morning and evening hours tend to be most productive, and having a good pair of binoculars makes all the difference in your experience.

# Planning Your Alaska Adventure

# Best Time to Visit

The best time to visit Alaska is during the summer between May 10 and September 15. You'll experience temperatures in the 60's to low 70's, 16‚Äì24 hrs of daylight, leaves and flowers in bloom, rushing rivers, and the best wildlife viewing.

However, each season offers something special:

* **June-August**: Peak season with warmest weather and longest days
* **May and September**: Shoulder seasons with fewer crowds and potential cost savings
* **Winter**: Northern lights viewing and unique winter activities like dog sledding

# Transportation and Logistics

In 2025, I'm especially encouraging travelers to book on the Alaska Railroad; the rental car shortages have been bad the past few years and it's a better choice for seeing Alaska without extra driving and costs. The **Alaska Railroad** offers spectacular scenic routes between major destinations and removes the stress of driving unfamiliar roads.

That said, having a car does provide flexibility for exploring at your own pace. Most fly-in and drive trips start from Anchorage or Fairbanks; it's the easiest way to see several towns along the road system.

**Essential planning tips:**

* Book accommodations and tours well in advance, especially for summer travel
* Pack layers for unpredictable weather
* Budget accordingly‚ÄîAlaska is not a budget destination, but the experiences are worth the investment
* Consider focusing on 1-2 regions rather than trying to see everything in one trip

# Your Alaska Adventure Awaits

Alaska has this incredible ability to exceed even your wildest expectations. Whether looking at it on a map or seeing it in person, Alaska's sheer size stands out, but it's not just the scale that's impressive‚Äîit's the pristine wilderness, the incredible wildlife, and the sense of adventure that permeates every experience.

From the moment you spot your first glacier to the last glimpse of the northern lights, Alaska creates memories that will last a lifetime. The state changes you somehow, opening your eyes to the raw power and beauty of the natural world in ways you never imagined possible.

So start planning your Alaska adventure today. Research the destinations that speak to your soul, book your accommodations early, and prepare for a journey that will undoubtedly rank among the most extraordinary experiences of your life.

I‚Äôll go to a more authentic restaurant when I can, but love me Taco Bell, I got the damn Crocs slides collab. I used to own a broken Taco Bell exit sign (they were throwing it out) and fixed it up. The Grilled Cheese Burrito is the best thing they‚Äôve come out with, chicken is the best followed by black beans, followed by steak then ground beef. I can submit proof of the sign and slides.

2nd- I eat beans out the can warmed up in a bowl with some spices and cheese, maybe sour cream. Talking black beans and kidney beans. 

3rd- Black beans at F is a damn war crime. At least a C is fair. It‚Äôs the perfect average bean because it‚Äôs more versatile than the other beans that were listed. Same with kidney beans, but black beans are slightly more versatile than kidney. Beans in chili are lovely and fill it out more, they give you a plant based protein in addition to the main protein. 

4th- I don‚Äôt like humus, I keep trying it every once in awhile to see if I do but still no. Chickpeas in a salad though? Shit I‚Äôll thrown black beans too if it‚Äôs like a taco salad. Chickpeas themselves are like an A or B.

5th- When made well, green beans are an A or B. I love me a green bean casserole when Thanksgiving comes around, I don‚Äôt have it that often so I love it.

6th- Jelly beans are a D. There‚Äôs better beans and better candy out there. Taste is ok, but I agree that I don‚Äôt like the texture and them sticking to your teeth. Cocoa beans when made it chocolate are an S when done right, but as someone who‚Äôs reduced their caffeine consumption and wants to quit it entirely, I don‚Äôt eat chocolate anymore which is sad.

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ovf38/33m_caught_my_gf_30f_in_a_lie_by_omission_not/)  **Jan 7, 2018**

I've been with my GF for just over 2 years now. We've both been through a lot, changes in careers, a couple of moves (each on our own) and now we're finally in a good spot. She just moved in to her brand new home, and I have a nice new condo.

We're talking about moving in to one and renting the other, although lately that conversation has cooled off.

She is a doctor and spends a lot of time at the hospital working, and time at coffee shops with other doctors reviewing notes, studying new material/keeping up to date, lectures and other things that they need to review and keep on top of.

There are always been one who has struck me the wrong way. Another male doctor who is 36 who she studies - his is fit, tall, single, and from what I can tell - attractive. We'll call him Tom. My GF has always been open with when they meet. He has asked her out on a date on several occasions, including just this weekend. She has always told me about that, and even shown me the messages if asked. My ex of 8 years cheated on my for months so I do have some demons to face, and she understands. I'm pretty good at keeping it in check, but Dr Tom has me on my guard as this is the way it started with my ex.

Well, she has enrolled in a dodgeball league on Monday nights (starting tomorrow) as I still go to class and she needs something to do. She hasn't said much about it other than she was planning on going alone and making some new friends (she said that weeks ago). This is where it changes. Today we were laying on her couch, she was asleep and a text previws came in from Doctor Tom - ""What time is dodgeball tomorrow? I'm looking forward to it"".

She never told me she invited him, and she knows my radar is up on him.

I prodded it a bit by asking ""Hey are you still going to dodgeball tomorrow?"", but just a basic ""yep"" is all I got.

I might just be paranoid, but this seems very much unlike her to keep this from me. Should I be concerned?

tl;dr: GF is hanging out with a guy who has asked her out several times - she hasn't said anything to me.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**raptorsinthekitchen**

>So, she may not have mentioned it to you because, as you say, your radar is up on him. I'm not sure what that means, but if you've spoken to her about him before, she may feel like she can't mention him to you without you getting upset, or thinking something is going on when there isn't. 

>Alternately, there could be something going on. The fact that he's asked her out on a date on several occasions is troubling. Does he not know she's married or does he just not care? Either way, *she* should care, and she should have put the kibosh on him asking her out a long time ago. If he kept doing it afterward, that should bother her, too, because he doesn't respect her boundaries or her relationship.

>Ultimately, though, it's dodgeball. Maybe she heard about it from him, and that's why he's involved. Or maybe she doesn't see it as a big deal, because there's a ton of other people involved. You need to ask her what's going on directly, instead of trying to hint her into telling you. 

**OOP**

>>Correct, although they do work at the same hospital, he actually works F/T at another clinic and only on-call at this one. As far as I know they have only worked together a couple of times in the past year. Most of their communication happens when they meet to study (sometimes in groups, but often just one-on-one at a local coffee shop). I don't believe there is too much crossover for them in the workplace, and if there was she would tell me about ""harassment"". From what I can tell the attention he has given her hasn't been necessarily unwelcomed by her.

**~**

**lcdr218**

>She can‚Äôt choose her interactions with Tom at work but she can definitely choose her interactions with him outside of work. 
She knows your radar is up but she might feel that she didn‚Äôt want to upset or worry you which is why she made that omission. 
Have a talk to her about your concerns and let her know. I don‚Äôt think you are coming off jealous doing that. Ask her to put her in your shoes. If it was you doing an activity outside of work with a girl that has put the moves on you a few times how would that make her feel ? 

>I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for her to spend time with someone who doesn‚Äôt respect the relationship she‚Äôs in (asking her out on a date when he knows she‚Äôs in a relationship). Even if they genuinely just get along well and are good work friends she still needs to know how you feel and you would like her to be open about it. She needs to know that you feel that he‚Äôs crossed the line with her and she needs to address it with him. 

>She might also be liking his attention for some reason but she needs to hear from you that that attention is detrimental to your relationship with her. It‚Äôs not that she can‚Äôt have friends, but she can‚Äôt choose to spend more time with someone who is giving her inappropriate attention and hiding it from you. She needs to set the boundaries as respect you and the relationship that you are both in. 

**OOP**

>>Thanks, this is a good summary of what other posters had put together. She hasn't set any boundaries with him, and instead of ""no"" she always gives him an excuse. I know she thinks he is a good guy but she hasn't given him defined boundaries as far as I know.

>>We just had an evening phone call and I casually asked about him constantly asking her out (as we just talked about him the other day) and she said that she understands and will tell him to go fly a kite. But she again didn't bring up dodgeball at all.

>>My insecure mentality wants to just ""show up"" to dodgeball tomorrow dressed to play and see if they're there/show up together. My sane mind says to leave it alone and trust that she will make the right decision.

[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7pklhu/update_33m_caught_my_gf_30f_in_a_lie_by_omission/)  **Jan 10, 2018 (3 days later)**

We talked, I told her about what I found and how I felt about Dr Tom. It was a tough conversation, she wasn't happy that I saw anything on her phone, but that wasn't the issue the brought it all down. She felt that after 2 years that the trust should be concrete and that it shouldn't have even been an issue. She showed me everything her and Dr Tom had ever talked about and that they were just colleagues.

We talked a lot over the past few days, and tonight she came over when I got off of work and said that she just couldn't be with me until I could learn to trust 100% again. Even though it was MY demon and I know I needed to work on it, she didn't want to be in the way of my becoming a better me. I need to work on myself and that she just can't do us anymore.

She cried, she brought my house keys back, and told me that no matter what she'll always be here. She cried some more, then she left.

tl;dr: We broke up.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**tysonherpes**

>While it is possible she was put off by your insecurities something is not sitting right. The fact that you had voiced your concerns about this Tom guy and she still decided to be sneaky is just shady. He has disrespected your relationship by trying to date her and she has decided to hang out with him outside of work. You are better off without her. It's not a new relationship, you communicated with her but she decided to keep secrets even though she knew it could hurt you and raise red flags. Shame on her for making it seem like your insecurities are to blame.

**OOP**

>>I know, my friend kind of told me the same thing - she pushed the breakup on me for my problems, but instead didn't really acknowledge anything else.

**~**

**pegmatitic**

>Honestly I think you may have dodged a bullet. This guy has asked her out more than once, knowing that she was in a relationship, and she dumps YOU because this is YOUR problem? I think your concerns were entirely valid and your original post didn‚Äôt strike me as pathologically insecure. It sounds like she used this as an excuse to break up with you without seeming like the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù (with the whole ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get in the way of you becoming a better you‚Äù) ... I could obviously be wrong, but that‚Äôs the impression I‚Äôm getting from this.

**sugarangelcake**

>>She basically just said ""It's not me, it's you""... Yikes.

**Behemothwasagoodshot**

>>>We only have OP's side of the story, to be honest, and he is freaking out because this guy who is in all her social circles is asking about the game. I mean, she turned him down, and she likely can't control socializing with him. She's been open with her media and allowed her SO to look at all of her messages despite the fact that she clearly does value her privacy. We haven't heard what the past two years have been like for his SO. So maybe she was carrying on an affair, or maybe she expected OP's jealousy to eventually subside and it didn't. Hard to say from what we get here.

>>>I will say this. Managing workplace/schoolplace guys who have interest in me is something I require a lot of latitude on and I really would not appreciate my SO putting pressure on me to do things that would make my workplace uncomfortable, especially if we're talking about a guy there's less than 0 chance of me being into. Guys do not understand how fraught rejections and boundary drawing can be and the impact that can have on, you know, your career. I have colleagues like this who I am ""in contact"" with. I get messages like this and I ignore them. It's a better work choice. If I really shut down a guy and tell him to straight up not speak to me or contact me on social media, he's likely to argue with me about it or push my buttons or take it out on me at work or start rumors or pour poison into people's ears about me, which could effect my career options. In a way, a guy who thinks he has a theoretical shot at you but is constrained by the fact that you have an SO is easier to deal with than a guy who has no such illusions. I realize this makes me sound calculating and I am. But I have also never cheated.

**OOP explains why the Dr Tom incident is different from having male friends**

>Yes of course. Believe it or not I haven't had any jealous or controlling issues with her. She has a lot of male friends who I've never worried about. I have never accused her of anything before Tom came in to our lives. We actually had things REALLY good for a long time. It was MY past she was bothered with as I had a very active 20's, whereas she was in med-school and really only dated very casually.

>I've never had a reason to question her before dr Tom, and I know you probably won't believe it, but her bahaviour when they started talking was different, and my radar went off.

>Dr Tom however came out of nowhere a couple of months ago. I never even thought about it until she told me the first time he asked her out. Then I started to get anti-trusting which was my fault. As he continued to do so, I continued to push, which again was my fault. Finally I did what I shouldn't have - and that was the end of it. If she ends up with Dr Tom, I'll feel shitty, but at least I'll know I was right.

>If she doesn't, I fucked up big time.

Welcome to Puerto Rico, where the Caribbean dream meets American convenience in the most spectacular way possible.

Recent tourism statistics reveal just how extraordinary this destination has become. Puerto Rico welcomed over **6.1 million travelers** in 2023, generating a record-breaking **$9.8 billion in tourism revenue** ‚Äì a remarkable 13% increase from the previous year. The U.S. Department of Commerce even ranked Puerto Rico as the fastest-growing U.S. jurisdiction in visitor numbers since 2020, while UN Tourism placed it second worldwide in tourism growth, trailing only Qatar.

From the cobblestone streets of Old San Juan to the mystical waters of Mosquito Bay, Puerto Rico offers an incredible diversity of experiences that rival any international destination. Whether you're seeking adventure in America's only tropical rainforest, relaxation on world-ranked beaches, or immersion in rich cultural heritage, this comprehensive guide will help you discover the very best places to visit in Puerto Rico.

# Historic and Cultural Gems That Tell Puerto Rico's Story

# Old San Juan: Where Five Centuries Come Alive

**Old San Juan** stands as Puerto Rico's crown jewel, a UNESCO World Heritage site that perfectly preserves 500 years of Caribbean history. This 16th-century walled city captivates visitors with its **pastel-hued colonial buildings** and original cobblestone streets that have witnessed centuries of Spanish, American, and Caribbean influences.

The experience begins the moment you step off one of the complimentary **garita carts** ‚Äì free transportation that winds through the historic district, connecting you to major landmarks including the imposing **Castillo San Felipe del Morro** and **Castillo San Crist√≥bal**. These Spanish citadels offer breathtaking ocean views and fascinating insights into Puerto Rico's strategic military importance throughout history.

Beyond the historical significance, Old San Juan pulses with contemporary energy. The neighborhood hosts vibrant nightlife, world-class restaurants, and boutique shopping opportunities that seamlessly blend with the colonial architecture. Local tip: Join one of the free walking tours offered by the city to uncover hidden stories and architectural details that standard guidebooks often miss.

# Ponce: The Pearl of the South

Founded in the late 1600s, **Ponce** showcases Puerto Rico's architectural heritage in stunning detail. The city's main plaza features the iconic **Parque de Bombas** firehouse, the elegant **Fuente de Los Leones**, and the majestic **Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe** ‚Äì all representing different eras of the island's cultural evolution.

The **Castillo Serrall√©s Museum**, housed in a 1930s mansion on the former Don Q rum estate, offers visitors both historical education and rum tasting experiences. The property includes Japanese gardens and a butterfly house, making it a perfect blend of cultural learning and natural beauty. Ponce's strategic location on the central southern coast also provides easy access to offshore destinations like Caja de Muertos Island.

# Natural Wonders That Showcase Puerto Rico's Ecological Diversity

# El Yunque National Forest: America's Tropical Paradise

**El Yunque National Forest** holds the unique distinction of being the only tropical rainforest within the U.S. National Forest System. Spanning **29,000 acres** of lush vegetation, this ecological wonder features over **25 miles of year-round hiking trails**, cascading waterfalls, and natural swimming pools that provide refreshing escapes from the Caribbean heat.

The forest supports incredible biodiversity, including more than 200 tree species and serving as home to the endangered Puerto Rican parrot. Popular attractions include **Juan Diego Falls** and **La Coca Falls**, though experienced hikers should explore the less-crowded eastern trails like the **Angelito Trail**, which leads to secluded natural swimming holes away from the main tourist areas.

Masonry structures built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, including **Ba√±o de Oro** and **Ba√±o Grande**, add historical context to the natural beauty. The forest's elevation changes create distinct ecosystems, from lowland rainforest to cloud forest conditions, offering diverse experiences within a single destination.

# Bioluminescent Bays: Nature's Own Light Show

Puerto Rico hosts three of the world's five bioluminescent bays, with **Mosquito Bay** in Vieques recognized as the brightest bioluminescent bay on Earth. These natural phenomena occur when microscopic organisms called dinoflagellates emit blue-green light when disturbed, creating an otherworldly experience that must be witnessed to be believed.

**Laguna Grande** in Fajardo offers kayaking tours through mangrove channels that culminate in the glowing waters, while **La Parguera** in Lajas provides boat tours for those preferring a more relaxed viewing experience. The bioluminescence is best observed during new moon phases when artificial light interference is minimal.

These bays represent fragile ecosystems that require careful protection. Tour operators follow strict guidelines to preserve the dinoflagellate populations, ensuring this magical experience remains available for future generations.

# Beach Paradise: Islands and Coastal Treasures

# Culebra: World-Class Beaches in an Untouched Setting

Located nearly equidistant between Puerto Rico's main island and the U.S. Virgin Islands, **Culebra** offers some of the Caribbean's most pristine beaches. **Flamenco Beach** consistently ranks among the world's best beaches, featuring sugar-white sand and crystal-clear waters perfect for snorkeling and swimming.

Reaching Culebra requires either a 30-minute flight or 45-minute ferry ride from Fajardo, but the barefoot paradise that awaits justifies the extra planning. The island maintains its unspoiled character with minimal development, allowing visitors to experience Caribbean beauty in its most natural state.

**Cayo Icacos**, another nearby destination, provides excellent snorkeling opportunities and serves as a popular day-trip location for catamaran excursions that include lunch and beverages. The surrounding La Cordillera Nature Reserve protects these pristine environments while allowing sustainable tourism access.

# Vieques: Beyond the Famous Glow

While **Vieques** is internationally known for Mosquito Bay's bioluminescence, the island offers remarkable diversity beyond this famous attraction. **Playa Negra** presents one of Puerto Rico's few black sand beaches, created by volcanic activity and offering a striking contrast to the region's typically white shores.

**Nav√≠o Beach** and **Sun Bay** provide excellent swimming and sunbathing opportunities, while the island's history as a former U.S. Navy training ground has left it largely undeveloped, preserving vast areas of natural beauty. The **Vieques National Wildlife Refuge** protects much of the island's ecosystem and provides habitat for diverse bird species and marine life.

Accommodation options range from eco-friendly guesthouses to luxury resorts, allowing visitors to choose their preferred level of comfort while exploring this unique destination.

# Rinc√≥n: Surf Capital and Sunset Views

Puerto Rico's western coast town of **Rinc√≥n** has earned international recognition as a premier surfing destination, particularly during the November through March season when consistent swells create ideal conditions. **Domes Beach** hosts international surfing competitions, while other area beaches accommodate surfers of all skill levels.

Beyond surfing, Rinc√≥n offers spectacular sunset viewing opportunities and maintains a laid-back atmosphere that appeals to visitors seeking relaxation. The town features excellent restaurants, boutique accommodations, and easy access to other western coast attractions.

Even non-surfers find plenty to enjoy in Rinc√≥n, from beach lounging to exploring local art galleries and experiencing the town's vibrant cultural scene.

# Hidden Gems and Authentic Local Experiences

# Adventure Beyond the Guidebooks

**Tres Picachos**, one of Puerto Rico's highest mountains, offers challenging hiking opportunities with 360-degree views of the central mountain range. The 3.4-mile trail demands physical preparation, but rewards hikers with panoramic vistas and the opportunity to enjoy locally-grown coffee at **Cafe Tres Picachos**.

**Caja de Muertos** (Coffin Island), an uninhabited island off Puerto Rico's southwestern coast, provides pristine beaches and excellent snorkeling opportunities without crowds. Despite its ominous name, the island offers peaceful natural beauty and serves as a protected nature reserve.

**Gozalandia Falls**, also known as **Charca de la Leche**, features milky-white waters cascading through lush tropical vegetation. This local favorite provides natural swimming pools and photo opportunities that showcase Puerto Rico's inland beauty.

**Cueva del Indio**, located on the northern coast, displays prehistoric cave art created by the indigenous Ta√≠no people centuries before Spanish colonization. The site combines cultural education with natural beauty, featuring dramatic coastal cliff formations.

# Culinary Culture and Local Flavor

**Guavate** in Cayey, known as one of Puerto Rico's three ""rutas del lech√≥n"" (pork highways), offers authentic local dining experiences featuring slow-roasted pork and traditional dishes accompanied by live music and dancing. This mile-long stretch of roadside stands provides cultural immersion alongside exceptional food.

The **Pi√±ones** coastal area east of San Juan combines beautiful beaches with outstanding local cuisine, particularly fresh seafood and traditional Puerto Rican fritters. The area also features the impressive **Maria de la Cruz cave** and kayaking opportunities through mangrove ecosystems.

Puerto Rico's emerging **craft brewing scene** includes establishments like **Ocean Lab Brewing Co.** in Isla Verde, **Boquer√≥n Brewing Co.** in Cabo Rojo, and **Se√±orial Brewing Co.** in Ponce. These breweries incorporate local ingredients like passion fruit, quen√©pa, and mango into traditional brewing techniques.

# Practical Travel Information for Your Puerto Rico Adventure

# Optimal Timing for Your Visit

The **peak season from December through April** offers ideal weather conditions with minimal rainfall and comfortable temperatures perfect for both beach activities and hiking excursions. This dry season coincides with the best surfing conditions and optimal visibility for bioluminescent bay tours.

**Shoulder seasons in May and November** provide excellent value opportunities with fewer crowds and reduced accommodation costs. While humidity levels increase during these periods, the weather remains generally pleasant for most activities.

The **hurricane season from June through November** requires careful planning, though Puerto Rico's tourism infrastructure has demonstrated remarkable resilience and recovery capabilities. Many travelers find excellent deals during this period, particularly in early June and late November.

# Transportation and Accessibility

**Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport** in San Juan serves as the primary gateway, offering direct flights from most major U.S. cities through carriers including JetBlue, Frontier, Spirit, and major legacy airlines. The airport's recent infrastructure improvements have enhanced the arrival experience for increasing visitor numbers.

**No passport requirements** for U.S. citizens make Puerto Rico uniquely accessible among Caribbean destinations. Travelers need only valid government-issued identification, with Real ID requirements applying for domestic air travel as of May 2025.

**Rental car availability** throughout the island provides the flexibility to explore beyond San Juan's metropolitan area. Many of Puerto Rico's most spectacular destinations, including El Yunque, Ponce, and the western coast beaches, are easily accessible by car and offer scenic driving experiences along well-maintained roads.

# Accommodation Strategy by Region

**San Juan and surroundings** provide the best base for first-time visitors, offering easy access to Old San Juan's historic attractions, Isla Verde's beaches, and day trip opportunities to El Yunque and other nearby destinations.

**Western coast locations** like Rinc√≥n appeal to visitors seeking surfing, sunset viewing, and a more relaxed pace, while **southern coast areas** around Ponce offer cultural attractions and access to offshore islands.

**Eastern locations** near Fajardo provide convenient access to ferry services for Culebra and Vieques, while **central mountain areas** appeal to hikers and nature enthusiasts seeking cooler temperatures and different ecosystems.

# Conclusion: Your Caribbean Paradise Awaits

Puerto Rico delivers an extraordinary combination of Caribbean beauty, rich cultural heritage, and American convenience that makes it truly unique among tropical destinations. From the historic cobblestone streets of Old San Juan to the mystical glow of bioluminescent bays, from world-class beaches to the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest System, this remarkable island offers experiences that satisfy every type of traveler.

The recent surge in tourism, with over 6.1 million visitors generating nearly $10 billion in economic impact, reflects Puerto Rico's growing recognition as a world-class destination. Yet despite this popularity, the island retains authentic local culture, hidden gems, and opportunities for genuine discovery that reward travelers willing to venture beyond the most obvious attractions.

Whether you're planning a romantic getaway, family vacation, solo adventure, or group expedition, Puerto Rico's accessibility, diversity, and warmth create the perfect foundation for unforgettable memories. With no passport required and direct flights from major U.S. cities, your Caribbean paradise is closer than you might imagine.

Start planning your Puerto Rico adventure today ‚Äì this enchanting island is ready to exceed your expectations and redefine what you thought possible in a tropical getaway.",1,1749131446.0,TicketToEverywhere,0,1.0,False

In my two previous relationships, it was the girls who made the first move. I honestly didn‚Äôt feel much at the beginning ‚Äî things developed later. But this time, it‚Äôs different. I‚Äôve truly fallen for someone before anything even started, and I want to be the one to take initiative.

I‚Äôd like to invite her out ‚Äî something casual, like coffee or a walk. Nothing with strong ‚Äúdating vibes‚Äù right away. But I want to approach it in a respectful and wise way, especially since we‚Äôre both in leadership roles and share the same faith.

Also, I plan to do it after June 12 (which is Valentine‚Äôs Day here in Brazil), just to avoid the impression that I‚Äôm trying to avoid being single on that day ‚Äî which is a common assumption when someone asks someone out right before.

**There are two types of Chinese calendars:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **The Lunar Calendar** (also called the ‚ÄúÂÜúÂéÜ‚Äù or ""Nong Li"" "" Yin ):This is used for traditional holidays like Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival. It follows the moon‚Äôs cycle.

**üëâ Every 1st of each lunar month is a New Moon, and the 15th is a Full Moon.**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **The Sexagenary cycle Calendar** ( also known as ganzhi or stems-and-branches Âπ≤ÊîØÂéÜ ÔºâThis is the calendar used for **BaZi and another Chinese metaphysics.** It uses a repeating 60-day cycle made of stem-branch combinations.Each year, month, day, and hour has a pair of these energies‚Äîthis is where your ""Eight Characters"" come from.

So actually when you enter your birth info into a BaZi app or consult a practitioner, the system first converts your Gregorian birth date into the Gan-Zhi calendar. **üëâ That converted date‚Äîthat‚Äôs your true birthday in BaZi!**

üìå And fun fact: your zodiac sign is also based on this calendar‚Äînot on Chinese New Year, but on a solar term called Li Chun Á´ãÊò•(Start of Spring).    That‚Äôs why some people get confused about their zodiac animal.

So it's 6:00 am. I'm drinking coffee and texting with Robert. There's a knock on the door. Someone's toilet is blocked? No, it's Junior! He is going to help Mr. Yao with some handyman jobs. He came so early because he didn't want to be late.

So I told him to shut up and not wake up anyone else up. I made him coffee and breakfast. It was precious time together, like the old days!

He is up to two customers in his lawn business. He made a deal with Mr. Thomas: if Mr. Thomas lets him use his equipment for the other customers, he will do the Goldstein-Thomas house for free. Junior's actually very good at gardening. He worked with the landscapers last summer at the Goldstein-Thomas house and at his school. He told me that Sopie will be coming over after school tomorrow and spending the night. I can't believe that she didn't tell me herself!

He will be doing the customer's garden on Saturday and she wants to help. Then they will meet up with another prospective customer. A very strange date, right?

**Cedrat Boise Intesne:** The opening was interesting, can definitely get the citrus to notes with a touch of spice. The dry down was really nice on this, a little fresher and mellow than the opening. Day 2 wearing it and I'm enjoying it. **8/10**

**Saharian Wind:** Hard to put a finger on what this smells like, you can get a mix of spices and a slight touch of citrus from the bergamot, it then becomes a more muskier scent. I read someone say it's great for a late summer evening, I can picture that being a good scenario for this. nothing special, I wouldn't buy it. **6.5/10**

**French Riviera:** Had to sample the most hyped Mancera fragrance. Not a bad scent by any means, but for me it's quite feminine, very powdery and perfumey, I couldn't see myself wearing this. I will say the projection is massive, I gave it to someone else to wear in my house, I could smell them from upstairs. **7/10**

**Cosmic Pepper:** The opening I'm not a fan of, smells like I'm sat in a waiting room for a dentist or something, I don't know smells pretty weird to me. The dry down reminds me off a cheap generic male cologne for 20 Euro. **3/10**

**Kumkat Wood:** Interesting scent, very bright and citrus opening, The woody notes aren't too bad, although it just smells like a synthetic citrus mess. Dry down is decent, reminds me of spending a day in the sun, became a skin scent in about 30 minutes, poor projection. **5.5/10**

**Sand Aoud:** Opening is not bad, can definitely get the oriental spices. There's something about the synthetic oud in this I'm not sure about, you can just tell its not the best oud note and makes me feel the fragrance could be better. **5/10**



**Lemon Mint:** Not nice at all, the citrus opening is bad, smells like I just used a citrus hand sanitiser in a doctors waiting room, and there's something about it that smells like a soiled diaper. The dry down is giving me the same cheap aftershave scent as Cosmic Pepper. Awful. **2/10**



**Red Tobacco Intense:** The opening isn't too bad on this one, there's a lot of strong notes but actually neither overpower each other. The tobacco is decent, not too smokey and it captures the sweet spicy leather well, the vanilla makes more of an appearance as time passes. The dry down has quite a pleasant vanilla tobacco accord, although there's nothing 'intense' about this. I do feel there better fragrances out there if this is the vibe you're going for. **7.5/10**



**Amore Caff√®:** I'm not getting any coffee here at all, honestly I'm struggling to distinguish any of the notes advertised in this, it's a bit of a mess. Smells like a cheap caramel candle or something. Couldn't wait for the dry down, I had to wash it off my arm, maybe the dry down might have improved it like some of these Mancera scents but the opening was awful. **3/10**



**Aoud Exclusif:** The opening isn't bad, nothing to dislike, as far as oud scents go it's not the best. The mixture of top notes are decent, nothing overpowering here. Not much changed on the dry down for me. It is what it is, musky, 'oily' oud accord. **5/10**



**-**

Maybe I'm not ready for Mancera's 'niche' fragrances, but a scent is a scent at the end of the day, you will either find it good or bad, I found these to be mostly bad. The opening's where quite intense but most mellowed in the dry down and changed their scent to something a bit more pleasant.



I think the only one I'd consider buying is Cedrat Boise Intense, the least offensive and most mass appealing I would say, French Riviera is quite nice but too feminine for me.

As someone tasked with laundry for an active household brimming with kids, pets, and their endless messes, I‚Äôve been through my fair share of detergent options. This one stands out in several areas, though there were moments when I wondered if some hype was unwarranted. Here's the tea.

**Ease of Use and Convenience**  
Laundry detergent in pac form might be the best invention after sliced bread. With these pods, there‚Äôs no more fumbling with scoops of powder or pouring just the right amount of liquid. Pulling out one of these perfectly portioned pods and tossing it straight into the drum saves time and effort‚Äîespecially when your toddler's grabbing at your legs while you‚Äôre doing chores. For someone juggling a million things, this simplicity is golden. 

[Check Tide 37000917984 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b00vraf7zu/)

**Gentle Cleaning for Sensitive Skin**  
The hypoallergenic formula is honestly one of the best perks here. My youngest has sensitive skin that reacts dramatically to perfumes or dyes. I was cautious when trying this for the first time, but it lived up to the promise. Both the NEA (National Eczema Association) and NPF (National Psoriasis Foundation) certifications give peace of mind, especially when it ranks high among dye-free and unscented products. Clothes came out clean, soft, and without any trace of residue. My kids and even my partner with sensitive skin have had zero issues after weeks of use‚Äîa huge win.

**Performance and Stain Removal**  
Stain removal is where I gave these pods the real test. Grass stains from baseball practice, spaghetti sauce on white t-shirts, and even the occasional coffee spill on a couch throw were all thrown into the washer. The product worked its magic on most of these. The fact that it operates effectively in cold water adds a layer of value‚Äîenergy savings for the win. However, I‚Äôll admit that for some really tough grime, I still had to give the stain a pretreatment scrub before tossing the garment into the machine. Considering that it claims to handle 100% of common stains, I was expecting no effort on my end. But hey, nothing‚Äôs perfect.

**Packaging and Portability**  
The compact nature of the container is chef's kiss. I‚Äôve used bulky detergent jugs before, and those are unwieldy disasters in my small laundry room. The Tide Free & Gentle container? Streamlined and easy to tuck away, even if it's not particularly reusable (more on that later). Each pac weighs in at just under an ounce‚Äîlight, handy, and tidy.

**Positives**  
These include the main selling points that I found most useful.  
- NEA and NPF certifications for sensitive skin assurance.  
- Effective in cold water, saving on utility bills.  
- Hypoallergenic formula‚Äîtruly no irritating residues.  
- Convenient, pre-measured pods‚Äîless mess, more time saved.

**Shortcomings**  
While the pods shine in many ways, a few areas could use refinement.  
- Tough, deeply set stains may require additional pretreatment.  
- The plastic packaging is not the most eco-friendly option.  
- Pods occasionally stick together if not stored perfectly.  

**Competing Brands**  
I‚Äôve used other trusted names‚Äîlike Persil and Seventh Generation‚Äîboth of which cater to sensitive skin niches. Persil ProClean pods are excellent for stubborn stains, but they carry a noticeable scent, which doesn‚Äôt work for people in my household with sensitivities. Seventh Generation focuses heavily on being eco-conscious, which admittedly edges out the Tide pods when it comes to the environment, but I‚Äôve found it lacks the deep-clean power Tide Free & Gentle offers. Factor in the convenience and versatility (works across all washing machine types, even HE ones), and it‚Äôs fair to say Tide finds a balanced sweet spot. However, for those prioritizing ultimate eco-friendliness, you'll need to assess your priorities.

**Value Assessment**  
Is it a budget-friendly choice? That depends. Tide products are often a bit pricier than generic or store-brand alternatives, but you do get quality in return. These pods pack detergent, stain removers, and color protection into one‚Äîessentially giving you three benefits bundled in a single item. Compared to buying separate products, the pricing feels justified. Still, they‚Äôre not aiming for the ‚Äúultra-budget-conscious‚Äù market and likely never will.

I recently discovered this sub and have loved some of the ideas and feedback. I wanted thoughts on my basement. This is my man cave and working area as well when I'm remote. I'm a minimalist hence no coffee tables. A constraint is obviously the gas stove given how hot it can get. I don't like some of the clutter I have on the white shelves but can't think of any better ideas. 

Open to thoughts on how you'd organize this differently. Thanks for any and all thoughts!

Hi, I‚Äôm in daily discomfort for a year and a half and getting worse (constant tinnitus in left ear just started and won‚Äôt go away- last neurologist asked me‚Ä¶ well what do you want me to do) and need help to find a doctor or path / department to pursue. Neurologists say I have migraines. The ENT says my sinuses are fines. The vascular neurologist says it‚Äôs vascular congestion from abnormal anatomy that got worse with age/ and an infection  and wants to put a stent above my heart. Most every doctor I talk to says no don‚Äôt do that‚Ä¶My aunt says it‚Äôs spiritual blockage haha! But from what I‚Äôve read about chronic pain I am interested in if this is neuroplastic/ learned pain, and not structural or neurological. However I do have white matter lesions developing on my brain that weren‚Äôt there two years ago, so clearly there are some structural changes taking place.

I feel most lost in trying to find a doctor who can help me rule out all possible causes because whatever we‚Äôve been trying isn‚Äôt working.. if any of the symptoms rings a bell for someone about causes I‚Äôd be really grateful. (It is SO hard to get appointments at different hospitals here in NY. Many neurologist are booked up a year or more! Do doctor referrals get you in quicker? Does going to the ER?) Thanks for reading! 




SYMPTOMS - Chronic daily head pressure in sinuses and forehead, behind the eyes and nose. Persistent dizziness. Constant tinnitus in left ear as of May 23rd 2025. Chronic sinus congestion, both the feeling of and actual - making it hard to breathe. Sometimes flares into a sharper headache, sometimes pulsing. Started seven years ago, gradually increased to daily and pretty much constant for the past year and a half. Worse when I lay down, often can feel the congestion and pressure shift in head, based on my position. (Feels like a lava lamp shifting). No aura. Two instances of flashing lights only. 

Frequently accompanying the pressure is dizziness, fuzzy field of vision/ trouble focusing, sensitivity to light and sound and sometimes nausea.

KNOWN TRIGGERS - (makes it worse) barometric pressure, bad sleep, laying down (for the pressure sensation).

SCANS DONE - CT, MRI showing white matter lesions (there weren‚Äôt there two years ago), XRAY - cervical, showing some arthritis in neck, MRA and MRV of head and neck. Vascular neurologist noted abnormal anatomical compression of the left brachiocephalic vein he believes is causing venous congestion worsened by dominant left jugular vein. He recommends a STENT in the LBV - looking for second opinions. 

PRACTITIONERS SEEN - ENT, acupuncturist, two neurologists, three pain doctors, physical therapy, chiropractor, psychiatrist, eye doctor, plastic surgeon, vascular neurologist.

[medications and procedures below did not significantly help unless noted] 

MEDICATIONS TRIED - Rhizatriptan, Sumatriptan, Trizanidine, Cyclobenzaprine (helps a little), Propranolol, Qulipta, Ubrelvy, Ajovy (three months), Emgality (1 round) - possibly helped but wary since may try for pregnancy, Prednisone (helped one time, another time less so), Flonase, Ipatropium, Topamax (helped lessen discomfort but side effects were bad), Verapamil (helped a significantly good amount for two months then stopped), magnesium + vit b supplements, Indomethacin (make worse/increased dizzyness), lorazepam (helps but try not take regularly). Nurtec. Diamox (maybe helping a little, too early to tell).

PROCEDURES - nerve blocks: occipital and by the right eye, Stellate Ganglian block (helped give relief for a few days), Magnesium IV push, five rounds of botox including in trapezius and masseter muscles, sphenopalatine nerve block, continuous glucose monitor, Septoplasty to fix deviated septum and turbinate reduction (helped a little, can breathe a little better), Prolotherapy injection in the C1 joint in the case that it was due to hypermobility there.

OTHER - Cefaly device helps regularly, Heal Your Headache Diet  (helped once then not - once it became daily), Cranial Sacral massage (helps but hard to keep up twice a week), sleeping with a cervical neck brace (helps a little).

OTHER:

Headaches/ sinus symptoms began at 30 after a bad sinus infection. 

No GI symptoms as a kid. 

Some cousins, aunts and uncle suffer from migraines. 


No aura, but lots of dizziness, congestion and pressure. 


Am curious about potential biofilm from past sinus infection exacerbated by covid being comorbid with migraines. 

Central Sensitization?

Long COVID?

My complex will not treat the entire building because they said they'd have to displace everyone. I'm not allowed per the lease to do any treating of the apartment on my own.

I saw (and killed) the first one in my apartment this morning but I assume that means there's likely more in my apartment, but looking in cabinets and drawers I don't see any more. the one I killed looked like a young one so I suspect they're breeding somewhere though.

My huge issue is I'm moving to a new place in 8 days and was already dying to get out, but now I'm TERRIFIED I'm going to bring roaches with me to my new place.

I've read the sticky post. I will be laundering and bagging all my clothes immediately, I don't have any unsealed food and I ordered sealed containers for pet food and some gel roach killer (even though I know it's not ‚ú®the most effective‚ú® since I've only seen one in my place). 

What do I even do to check if my coffee maker/other electronics have roaches in them? They love boxes, should I try to move all my stuff in bags? I have a big couch - are they likely to be in there?? Are there any extra tips or tricks to ensure I don't bring any with me when I move?

These professions are people I know and I'm just curious what other careers out there are like this. I'm not implying any of these jobs are easy and they require vastly different skills and a willingness to adapt in some way or another, but these feel like things most people could do with time, practice, and commitment:

1A) Fishing (AK) - Fishing boat. A friend owns his boat/business. Leaving the owner out of this, he pays a deckhand each season somewhere b/n 35-45k for about 4-5 months of work. The better the catch, the better the pay. As a sidenote - he's a good dude, but has also told me there are a lot of boat captains/owners who can have really shitty practices with their staff and nickel and dime them, so that's unfortunate.

1B) Fishing guide - I don't know numbers, but a few guides I've met will go to Alaska in Summer and somewhere else in Winter (Puerto Rico for tarpon being a big one)

2) Wedding industry- this involves a ton of professions. Photo/video, coordinators, planners, florists, rentals, make up, venues, other niche businesses. Each industry has their own average rate but people will work anywhere from 10-30+ weddings. If you make 5k/wedding and do 20 weddings, that's 100k before taxes & expenses.

3) Coffee/Snack truck - this is a bit of a unicorn, but I met someone who had a coffee truck that he would take to 3 music/dance festivals and make ~100k. Again, circumstance is everything, he attended these events in the 80s because he enjoyed them and then they grew.

I have tried everything it seems and am at a loss. I have had all sorts of combos of HRT‚Ä¶ compounded. Patches etc. 

A year ago 100mg progesterone was added in and I was told what a difference this will make for my insomnia.  No change. 150mg no change. My latest dose 200mg is no change. 

I‚Äôve also consulted with sleep specialist had a sleep study (negative) been RX and trialed various meds that seem to have no effect. Gabapentin etc. 

Have gradually added supplements. DHEA , gaba. Melatonin, Ashwaganda. Magnesium. I‚Äôm sure I am forgetting something.  NOTHING works. I am still getting just a few hours of sleep sometimes not even that. My brain is soooo wired at night like I have drank multiple cups of coffee.  

I am really at a loss on what to do. It‚Äôs been three years of this and nothing has changed for the better. Despite thousands spent on various treatments meds no difference. 

I will add a photo in comments that is my latest saliva hormone panel.  Things are still not balanced.  Estrogen P ratio still out of whack etc.  (edit to add I can‚Äôt add a photo. Estrogen is high end of normal. Progesterone low. The ratio is off 4L (previous was 2L).  Testosterone high end normal. 

I currently use Estrogen and T compound cream. P 200mg nightly.  DHEA very low end of normal. Cortisol AM low. 

My cortisol on this test was also low in the AM.  I would guess my PM cortisol is very high at least that‚Äôs how it feels. Like my cortisol levels are flipped. Low in the morning when they should be high and high at night.   I may do a four point cortisol level test but again $150 out of pocket .. in the event that is my main issue.

1l3z8r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/1l3z8r1/your_other_symptoms_with_anhedonia/,Your other symptoms with anhedonia,"I'd try to systematize other symptoms that go with anhedonia to understand its roots. I still believe (and scientists do so) that anhedonia is a symptom of somatic illness in itself.

Please. list your symptoms if they:

* began with anhedonia, just before or right after it started
* if the symptom worsens and improves in sync with anhedonia
* if you treated a symptom and anhedonia got better

# Also, PLEASE, mention if you're still vaping/iQOS and what experience you had when quitting during anhedonia. I think there's something there.

My list is:

1. Tension, discomfort and pain in the neck.
2. Tension, discomfort and pain in the thoracic spine.
3. Tension, discomfort and pain in the lower back.
4. You feel much better in terms of anhedonia after back/neck massage or back/neck exercise.
5. Gastrointestinal discomfort (intermittent diarrhea, belching, mild intestinal spasms)
6. Constant feeling of spasm in lower esophagus/solar plexus area.
7. Mill dizziness/lightheadedness without actual imbalance.
8. Mild to average sleepiness, overall increased need for sleep. Unusual ability to easily fall asleep after lying down during the day, couldn't really do that before 
9. Feeling more anhedonic and more severe symptoms in the morning rather than evening.
10. Coffee that used to invigorate before does close to nothing now.
11. Unusual weakness in limbs, overall feeling of being physically weaker.
12. Despite weakness, the feeling of TIREDNESS is no more. Even after a hard day's work I don't feel exactly TIRED but just as WEAK as all day. Lying down doesn't bring that ""stretch my legs"" pleasant wave I remember from my life before. Just lying down, might as well be sitting. Lying is probably more comfortable for the back and that's it.
13. When doing physical work/exercise you don't feel your body ""wake up"" as much as before, you sweat much less.
14. Natural thirst significantly diminished, less need for water.
15. More job tasks, more talking seems to diminish anhedonia
16. Occasional lack of sleep due to life events makes anhedonia milder
17. Regular tingling in hands & feet, less in other body areas, without loss of sensitivity.
18. I was feeling warm & hot all my life, even in winter, with anhedonia, I feel cold most of the time
19. All your body seems to be in a state of subtle tremor, especially in the morning.
20. In that very short period when you're still conscious but already falling asleep anhedonia seems to go away completely.
21. Really hot shower or sauna seems to diminish anhedonia
22. Short-term memory is noticeably impaired.
23. Also mid- and long-term memory can't keep information well since the beginning of anhedonia. Pre-anhedonia memories are still there as they were.
24. Reversal of weather impression: if you always like rain before and felt great when it was raining or cloudy, now you feel better when it's sunny or vice versa.
25. Even when not tired from something, STARTING physical activity is hard physically and emotionally but it quickly gets easier and brings some relief during and after.
26. Deeply, vividly remembering pre-anhedonia energy may spike a momentary relief.
27. Being irritated is almost the only emotional effect you get from personal communication involving a sincere interest of a person in yourself. You strongly prefer not to be asked about your wellbeing. Talking about your condition doesn't help or makes it worse.
28. Total silence is very uncomfortable even if it sometimes was ok before. You prefer any neutral distraction that doesn't require your participation: people speaking on youtube, soft background music, TV etc.
29. You may wake up several times per night (even if you fall asleep again quickly).
30. Thinking about Weekend approaching isn't really encouraging.
31. You feel chest tightness or possibly feel like you can't breathe freely.
32. Sometimes you realize that you actually have constant underlying anxiety that prevents you from being hedonic though you don't feel outright anxious. Perhaps using fast-acting tranquilizers episodically you notice anhedonia improvement.
33. There are times when you feel like all your drive, energy and emotions didn't really go away but they're piling up behind some brain dam, unable to flow freely. The dam is made of transparent glass, sometimes you can see all your joy behind but can't touch it.
34. Sometimes you may be actually in LOW MOOD (sad) which feels like a relief from anhedonia. But episodes of anxiety makes anhedonia worse.
35. You feel noticeably better when water-fasting for at least 16 hours, then again, often it doesn't work, but the trend is there.
36. You often feel heart palpitations.",0,1749130221.0,anhedonia,0,0.5,False

Not spam or phishing scams‚Äîthese were actual work emails. Composed in my voice. Signed with my name. Sent from my company account at impossible hours: 2:31 a.m., 3:17 a.m., even 4:00 sharp.

At first, I thought I must‚Äôve scheduled them by accident. Some new Outlook setting I didn‚Äôt remember enabling.

Then came the reports. Files I hadn‚Äôt opened yet. Documents that were filled out, formulas running perfectly, every detail correct. Time-stamped in the middle of the night. No errors. No trace of editing.

My manager, Caroline, praised my ‚Äúdedication.‚Äù Said she didn‚Äôt know I had it in me. I didn‚Äôt know either.

So I tested it.

One night, I unplugged my computer. Shut it down completely. Hid the power cord in my dresser drawer and went to bed.

The next morning, there was a new PDF waiting in my inbox. Drafted. Signed. Attached to a client thread I hadn‚Äôt opened in days.

I asked IT to check for suspicious logins. They said everything looked normal. Just me, logging in and out. They even showed the security footage of the office entrance.

I was there.

I was at my desk.

Except I wasn‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt sleepwalk. I don‚Äôt even live near the office.

I started staying awake. Coffee, energy drinks, cold showers‚Äîanything to avoid blacking out.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

The fourth night without sleep, I watched myself walk into my bedroom at 2:44 a.m., calm as ever. Sat down at my laptop. Opened a spreadsheet. Began typing. The screen glowed across my face.

Except I was already in bed, watching from the covers.

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt scream.

The next morning, Caroline sent me a Slack message: ‚ÄúGreat work last night. Keep this pace up.‚Äù

I quit the next day.

She didn‚Äôt respond.

But the emails kept coming.

Work kept being done.

Sometimes I get notifications from my old task management board. Completed assignments. Closed tickets.

Last week, someone scheduled a meeting with my name attached.

Caroline attended it.

I shrugged it off thinking maybe it was just because I was falling asleep and my brain is having auditory hallucinations. 

Last night, I woke up around 11 am, went in the living room to watch tv, sometime after midnight, one of my cats was sitting on the coffee table, and sat up really fast and just stared at my bedroom through the kitchen.

But I‚Äôm feeling like there is someone or something is in the room with me.

Other weird sounds are happening. I‚Äôm reaching out now incase I am being haunted before it escalates, I can reach out for advice. 

I used to mess with ouija boards at 13/14 years old, in an obsessive way, to the point everyone in my family were seeing what we all called the shadow people.

Everyone in the house had experienced weird things. Mind you this was early 2000s, before we knew that other people called them shadow people and had similar experiences. So come 2010ish, when we googled it one day, and saw it was a thing others experienced, we were all kind of freaked out.

Hi folks. Last week was actually really good. I went in the school because my older son has been nominated to represent school as a member of a group of 12 children in some kind of regional/state competition. He never told me anything about this but he also didn't know. So when his classmistress called me to come in the school I thought he was fighting again or did something stupid thing but then she explained me everything and as always I am super proud on him. His grades are awesome and the school year will soon be over. Younger son also has good grades. Not as good older brother but still good and I am pleased with him also.

In last tuesday my wife told me she wants to start going to some kind of emotional support group her therapist recommended to her. She said it's basically group full of remorseful cheaters. Lovely. She asked me if I was okay with her going to meetings 3 times per week mostly during the afternoon. I told her I am fine and didn't have any reaction to be fair. She immediately started saying how I can check everything with her therapist. She is not lying, support group exists, her therapist wants her to attend those meetings, she will share the location as always, I can wait for her...I told her I believe her and she is free to do whatever she wants. Idk, I think she believed I will have some bigger reaction but I really don't care about this. 

I am not a person who believes in therapy, couples therapy, ""support groups"" so whatever...I never stopped her from going anywhere or from hanging out with anyone so I definitely wouldn't do it now. Anyway, she went at the first meeting same day. What I found really weird is that when I came back home she was ready to leave and she was talking with some women at the phone in the local language saying how she is ready and she will pick her up. She asked me does she need to buy something when she comes back and she left. So when she came back she was in a really good mood. She talked with MIL in their language so I didn't understand anything but MIL later told me wife was super thrilled because she found her ""safe place"" and people who understand her. When I heard that I wanted to throw away my MIL from the balcony. My dear wife found safe place and people who can understand her why she fucked some other dude while being according to her happily married...

Anyway, same night wife approached me and told me she saw I am very quiet and asked me is that because of her. I told her no but I asked her who was the person she was talking to on the phone. She started to panic and said it was one of the woman from the group. She brought the phone immediately and started showing me it's her, I can call her...blah, blah...but I told her she doesn't need to show me anything but she was persistent and showed me everything and yes, she was telling the truth. But now she thought I was in a bad mood because of that so she again started with the same shit how she would never lie to me and she will never ever look at other man let alone touch someone else. So I asked her how does she know this woman if that's the day when she went for the first time to a meeting. So she said she knows her for some weeks because them 2 and one other woman sometimes have group meetings with her/their therapist. But she never told me this. She always says how she never lies to me and she is 100% honest but that's not true. So again she didn't say everything like she promised. 

I asked her why she lied about her salary and why she never told me she received some type of payment for our daughter from her goverment/country. She was stunned how do I know this and said she never told me about her bigger salary because I told her so many times that I don't need anything from her and that I don't care about money from her. Ok, this is true but when I said this I meant the gifts from her not about her salary. I mean, this is the first time she is working since we moved here and she is saying all the time how we are team now and she wants to participate 50-50 in paying bills and buying food. In reality she is not paying any bills except for her therapist. I am still paying literally everything including her insurance. She buys food regularly when she comes home from the therapist or when she goes to pick up the kids though. She said she received one time payment from her goverment for our daughter because they have some new law where they are rewarding all the kids under the age of 7. To be honest I really don't care about this small amount of money. What I do care is why she never told me. I mean, it's my daughter also. Again, she always says she is saying everything but she never does. I told her this. I really don't give a fuck about her salary. I don't want to brag but her salary won't change anything in my daily life because luckily I am earning more than enough to support all of us without any problem. I just want honesty from her but she doesn't understand that at all. The funniest part is that before Dday she would tell me all of these little things literally straight away. She was never hiding anything from me. I am not saying she was hiding this on purpose. But it's crazy to me that now when she needs to show up and do literally everything to fight for that fucking chance she apparently so desperately wants it somehow she is doing this. I don't know how to explain it honestly. She said she didn't say anything to me about already nice sum of money she saved because she planned to surprise me and the kids with some kind of vacation in the August and she said if she told me I would tell her to forget about that and she thought if she buys plane tickets and books hotel we would go. Again she showed me proofs how she was googling about some destinations and even checking bookings and plane tickets so let say I trust her but again I hate she is hiding things from me. So I explained her this in the most normal way and she promised she will never ever do something like this again. I told her OK and that was that. 

On saturday my friend Mark got married with Sung's best friend. Day before I was really nervous. Obviously wife and MIL knew Sung will be there. She wasn't a bridesmaid at the wedding but she was still one of the closest people to Mark's wife. So I knew if my wife does some stupid thing I will literally die from the embarrassment. Good thing was that my wife never drinks so alcohol won't be a factor. I saw and talked with Sung and told her to behave as best as possible and to ignore if my wife does or tells her something. She said ofc she will because it's her friends wedding. Well the conversation with the wife was super weird. I mean I asked her to behave nicely in front of the girl I am seeing...she cut the conversation and said she knows everything and I don't need to explain her anything. I really thought she will do some stupid shit after that conversation because she seemed furious and sad in the same moment. 

Before the ceremony I saw Sung for the 1st time. She walked near us and she looked amazing. To be honest wife looked really good also. Like she looked before Dday in my eyes. Wife noticed Sung and didn't say anything. After maybe 5 minutes I went with my sons to meet one other couple I know and my sons play with their son in the free time while wife, daughter and MIL were waiting behind. In that moment Sung approached because she also knows this couple and she ran her hand through my older's son hair and asked him does he want something to drink. I looked at her and she asked me how am I. My son told her he wants some juice and younger son said the same. When we came back where wife was I knew she saw everything but she literally didn't have any reaction. It's tough to explain. She looked like a robot. And maybe 10 minutes after Sung passed by us and told me we need to go because ceremony starts while wife was 1m away from me. During the ceremony everything was fine. After the ceremony same story. We were at table with my best friend, his wife and their kids. Wives and MIL were talking, kids were playing, I was talking with other guys. Sung was sitting far away from us and she sent me few messages but I ignored her because in my opinion she didn't respect what I've asked for. 

When we came home wife went to sleep immediately. I talked a little bit with MIL and she was like ""I know she hurt you deeply but it was very tough for her to watch Sung touching her children in front of her and you. She is my kid and I hope you both can move on so she can stop suffering."" I mean, I understand her. She is her kid, ofc she wants her to be happy. And I can understand wife in some way but at the end I never wanted this. Who knows, maybe next year she will have some other guy in her life and he will touch my kids also. Anyway I talked with Sung and told her this was way too much from her and she was very defensive saying she didn't do anything and that I am the one to blame because I brought wife at the wedding. Whole conversation was pain in the ass but to conclude: she thinks she didn't do anything special, she thinks I am the only one to blame because I am acting like I am happily married when I am not and I feel sorry for wife(I am not)when she did what she did. We are still okay though. Wife's shink told me in their meeting in tuesday wife told him everything about this and that she wanted to cry heavily but was scared to do that and she knew if she fucks up she might lose me immediately forever. I don't understand that logic to be honest because when you want to cry how can you stop yourself? Especially she because she is a pure talent to start crying after 2 seconds. Shrink told me he is very happy with her progress in the therapy.

Anyway, the reason why I am writing this update is because of what happened yesterday. I finished my work earlier and I called Melody to tell her I will pick up my sons from the school but she told me she is already in the car so I told her OK and I went home. I came home and I heard a lot of voices from the living room. And then I saw my wife and 5 other women sitting and drinking coffee. My wife jumped surprised when she saw me being at home this early. Then she told me: ""these are my friends from the support group. Come say hi!"" I couldn't believe it. She brought 5 cheaters in my home! Based on their looks, 3 locals, 2 foreigners, age late 20s-late 40s. I said hi and went upstairs in the bedroom. They left very soon and she came to ask me what is the problem. What is the problem??? She brought 5 fucking cheaters in my home. Best of all it wasn't the first time. Few of them were in my house in monday and last week as well. So my wife would work until 1:30pm, she would make a coffee and they would come in 2pm and they would talk until 3, 3:30 pm probably about length of their APs dicks before kids and I come home.

I told her to stay away from me. I was like where the fuck is MIL??? Why Melody never told me anything??? MIL was in her room. I was so furious at Melody that I almost fired her at the spot. I told her first day when wife came back to live with us to tell me literally everything. Whenever she leaves the house. Whenever she is yelling, crying, doing anything weird. Whenever someone comes in my house...and she never told me about this. She said she thought I knew because I talked with her about this group and I told her after few times she doesn't need to tell me when Nam or her other friend comes in the house so she thought since I talked with her about this group that I also know some of these women and wife told her ""friends from my group are coming to have a coffee."" 

At the end wife and MIL were shocked that ""I made a big deal out of this"". MIL even told me I should be happy wife has someone to talk about these ""sensitive"" topics. I lost my mind when I heard this and told her and wife that she has until 1.1.2026. to find other place to live and that I will file for divorce the next day after she leaves the house. Ofc she immdiately started to panic and had her manic episodes but I really don't care. I can't believe she thought I would be okay with her bringing 5 cheaters in my house. They were sitting at my couch, in my living room, drinking my coffee and laughing. Cheaters in my eyes are the biggest scums ever. People who are ready to do the biggest pain possible to their partners and kids because of pussy or a dick are the worst people. And that's it. I don't want to see them in my house. I never had problems when Nam came in our house or her other friend she is still good with. Because both of them are good women and strongly attacked her for her infidelity. And now I have 5 sluts in my house talking about what? How they are remorseful? Idgaf if they are remorseful, if their partners forgave them, if they are living like nuns since Dday...I don't care. 

Today wife sent me huge message when I was working where she said she will stop going at those meetings and she will never talk with any of those women again and she asked me did I really mean about deadline when she needs to move out and when I will file for divorce. I told her she can go wherever she wants and she can hang out with anyone she wants but I don't want to see them in my house. She responded how she will not go anymore because she didn't think this will be a trigger for me and how now she understands she needs to hang out with ""normal"" people and that she had no regard for my feelings. She asked me again about the deadline and I told her I am standing by my decision. She didn't say anything after that. When I came home I didn't see her. MIL told me: ""what do you think where is she? In her room crying how her life is over."" So I didn't see her at all today. She is still in her room. So yeah, maybe I fucked up and didn't prepare her for my words because her mental state is very fragile but I am really tired. Just when I see really positive things from her regarding this fucking wedding, her plans to surprise kids with some vacation, how she tries daily around older son as much as possible, how kids are happier than ever...and when I start to think who knows maybe in the distant future I might start looking at her again as the woman I love then she does some stupid shit like this. And it's always like this. Same cycle every few weeks. 

But the funniest part is this: I talked with a lot of people about this and about her not telling me she knows woman from the group already before, about her salary, payment from her goverment for our daughter, saving money for vacation...etc. My brother can't stand her but he told me I overreacted. He was like ""well, they are in therapy. They are not active cheaters so they might tell her some advice..."" My best friend told me I didn't overreact about her not telling me those things but I did about these women and I had to tell her ""you can hang out with them somewhere else""...but the thing is I told her this but when I heard MIL telling me how they talk about ""sensitive"" topics I exploded and told her about deadline. Some other friends including Mark told me I did the right thing but they can also somehow understand wife and that this group is her ""safe place""...but again, I don't have a problem with her attending these meetings. I have a problem with her not telling me these women were in my house. I want 100% transperency. I have a problem with her thinking I would be fine with seeing them in my house. And I talked with Nam and she understands me fully. She told me she will talk with her tomorrow and she can't believe how she thought this would be okay in my eyes and she can't believe she never told me all those financial things. 

So my brother and best friend told me I maybe overreacted but wife's best friend told me I didn't and that I should have been even more strict in my words and actions yesterday... So I don't know. Am I crazy to think I really didn't overreact..please tell me what do you think but don't be biased please. Take care and thank you.

There is no right or wrong way when it comes to pitching the Sleeping Beauty Offer on coffee dates.

Up front ‚Äòfee‚Äô? Or 100% performance based? It doesn‚Äôt matter. The most important thing is getting on coffee dates & building relationships!! But that is not why you are reading this.

Here is a little story about why I don‚Äôt charge up front.

When I played basketball, I was a 3 point shooter. In 2008 I played against Ricky Rubio and a few other NBA folk, in Barcelona, and hit 5 straight 3‚Äôs‚Ä¶ then got fouled on a 3 ball. And hit all 3 of them too, for 18 points in a 15 min flurry.

I was no Steph Curry but when I was on a streak I could light it up with the best of them. The hoop sometimes felt like it was 1 metre in diameter.

I COULD. NOT. MISS.

Everything I threw up went in. Today they might call it ‚Äòflow state‚Äô? Like anything though, where there was a yin there was a yang. The next few games I would fire up twenty 3 balls and hit zero.

Doughnut city. So frustrating. For me and my coaches! I guess that‚Äôs why I never really ‚Äòmade it‚Äô as a baller. No consistency. That‚Äôs OK though.The Universe had a different plan for me.

So how does this little ‚Äòpassive boast‚Äô of mine relate to charging up front or not lol? Well, when I have an offer that converts so well, and also gets such great results for clients‚Ä¶

I like to have a big ole ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô hoop.

If I have a coffee date, I want a ‚ÄúYes‚Äù 100% of the time. I might not actually end up working with them, because they might have a tiny database, or they might not have a CRM, or a sales team.

But, I want a lot of ‚ÄúHell Yeah, let‚Äôs do a test Dan‚Äù. Because, then I can choose. You see with this offer‚Ä¶ I am the chooser, not the chosen!

Make sense?

Here is another significant reason why I don‚Äôt charge up front.

When we are selling the Sleeping Beauty Offer (DBR with AI & SMS), yes we can make great money. But the long term passive money is when we ‚Äúget our claws in‚Äù.

* We help them with ‚ÄúSpeed to lead‚Äù.
* ‚ÄúOut of hours‚Äù leads - not a problem!
* Look after their ‚ÄúGoogle reviews with AI‚Äù - sure!
* ""Document collection‚Äù using AI - 100% Mr. Client!
* Look after their insta DM‚Äôs with AI - of course we can do that Mrs Client!!

The list goes on. Our Sleeping Beauty Offer is the ‚Äúfoot in the door‚Äù, which is why I like to be like Steph Curry on Coffee Dates.

Now‚Ä¶ a lot of you are on the fence when it comes to getting started with all this. If you‚Äôre still wondering whether this model could actually work for ‚Äúthe little guy‚Äù‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve got just the thing for you.

not proud of it but ozempic really does work.

for context, im 28 F, 4'11 weighing 56kgs pre-ozempic. hindi naman talaga ako malaki tignan, but for my height, parang feeling ko ang taba ko talaga. (i am also diagnosed with ED and bulimia). i tried gym and eating healthy like meal plan pa talaga but i guess malaking factor din is PCOS and stress.

so ayun na nga, 4 months ago i decided ok mag ozempic nga ako kasi ang dami na gumagamit and sabi nakakapayat. im on my 4th pen (4th month) and my weight is ranging from 47-48kgs nalang. i lost face fat and sobrang payat ko na tignan to the point sinasabihan na ako ng mga tao na sobrang payat na.

and when they ask me pano ako pumayat, i say ""ah kain lang ako konti"" kasi im ashamed na i did a shortcut huhu. i want to stop na kasi nga ang payat ko na pero im scared na tataba nanaman ako. 

but if u ask me ano side effect ‚Äî vomiting talaga kasi feel ko busog na busog ako, and mas malalang acid reflux to the point tumigil ako mag kape for 3 months (from having 2-3 cups of coffee since i was 18)

1l3ylsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1l3ylsx/community_repair_cafe/,Community Repair Cafe,"Organizing a repair event might just be the kind of thing that could turn a dull Saturday into a vibrant community gathering. I mean, think about it: a room full of eager DIYers and folks who are just a bit lost, standing side by side, tools in hand, all united by a shared mission‚Äîfixing broken stuff instead of tossing it in the landfill. This isn‚Äôt just about mending a chair or patching up an old jacket; it‚Äôs about weaving deeper bonds within our community.

First things first, you‚Äôll need a venue. If you‚Äôve got a church hall or a community center sitting empty, here‚Äôs your chance to put it to good use. Just picture the scene: tables lined with half-repaired bicycles, defunct toasters, and those pesky sewing machines that seem to only work when you don‚Äôt need them to. Charge a small fee‚Äînot to break the bank, but just enough to cover your costs and maybe buy some refreshments. Because who doesn‚Äôt love free coffee while they fix their things?

Let‚Äôs talk marketing. Local groups are your best friend here. Facebook groups, community bulletins, and those good ol‚Äô neighborhood chats are gold mines for spreading the word. Use social media to showcase what kinds of repairs people can expect. Maybe toss in a funny ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù photo to illustrate how far a little elbow grease and expert advice can go. Share the stories of the items that will be revived‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs not just about the thing you‚Äôre fixing, it‚Äôs about the memories tied to it. Did Grandma knit that sweater? Bonus points for nostalgia.

Now, when it comes to recruiting help, start reaching out to your friends, neighbors, and local hobbyists. Skilled folks tend to be humble, so don‚Äôt overlook that guy down the street who has a knack for everything. Maybe bribe them with some pizza or a heartfelt ‚Äúthank you‚Äù note. This is the space where strangers become friends, and everyone gets a taste of collaboration. 

Keep the atmosphere light and cheerful. Who says you can‚Äôt have a little fun while learning? Play some upbeat music, maybe incorporate a little contest for the funniest repair gone wrong. Create a space where people feel empowered to ask questions and aren't afraid to fumble with their tools. That‚Äôs how we grow, after all‚Äîby making mistakes and learning from them. 

And while we‚Äôre at it, don‚Äôt forget to weave in some themes of community and sustainability. Remind everyone that by repairing instead of replacing, they're not only saving money but also sending a powerful message about caring for our planet. It‚Äôs a small act with big ripple effects.

At the end of the day, you‚Äôll find that the true beauty of these gatherings isn‚Äôt just in fixing things‚Äîit‚Äôs in building relationships, fostering a spirit of support, and maybe even igniting a spark of inspiration in someone‚Äôs heart. So, grab that toolbox, put on your community hat, and get ready for a day of transformations that go beyond just the physical. It's all about saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô to new possibilities.",1,1749128490.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Shinra is entirely focused on beating Captain Burns, Joker is supposedly lending him a hand, while the rest of the group is busy first fighting Gold and then Dragon.!<

>! Why doesn't Shinra try to rush past Burns to at least get Obi free from his chains? There's even a moment when he's thrown from the bottom of the crater to nearly the top of the building, but instead of rushing to his captain and getting the bugs off him, he rushes back down to continue the fight. Joker even stops fighting and just sits on the sidelines watching the fight happen. Why doesn't *he* go and help? Why doesn't anyone from the rest of the squad even try to approach, or move the fight so they can get a bit closer (seriously, it really bugs me that they're still in front of the same wall they busted through originally)?!<

>! Finally, what is up with the time progressing both too fast and not at all? We're told that Obi is stopping the bugs from biting him by basically flexing his muscles so hard they can't actually penetrate his body, but we're also told that he can't keep it up for long. Immediately after that, we go from sunny noon to sunset and then to just night with the moon out and yet Obi is still flexing. Meanwhile, even though there's hours of daytime skipped, the action seems to just resume right where it was left off before. What happened? Did they all take a coffee break?!<

All in all, it makes no sense to me, and I was constantly fighting the urge to scream at my screen for them for their seeming tunnel vision.

I'm looking to upgrade from basic home coffee appliances to a real espresso setup. I‚Äôve done quite a bit of research and am leaning toward the *Lelit Anna with PID*. I understand the value of temperature stability and don‚Äôt want to mess with DIY PID kits, which is why Anna with PID stands out to me. That said, I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not overlooking a better option in this price range.

* **Location:** Europe (feel free to recommend EU-available models/stores)
* **Preferred drinks:** About 80% straight espresso, 20% milk-based drinks
* **Drink frequency:** 2‚Äì4 cups a day, no heavy entertaining
* **Space:** No major space constraints
* **Experience level:** Intermediate‚ÄîI‚Äôve been using simpler machines, but I‚Äôm ready for something more serious
* **Grinder:** I‚Äôll be using a standalone grinder, most likely the Baratza ESP
* **Preference:** Electric machines only. I‚Äôm not into manual levers or grinders at this point. No plastic in grouphead. 
* **Candidates:** Lelit Anna with PID is my main choice. Open to others if they offer more value or stability

I‚Äôd really appreciate suggestions, especially for machines that offer better build quality (less plastic like on the Bambino Plus grouphead) and temperature stability. Dual boiler isn‚Äôt necessary, as I won‚Äôt be steaming milk frequently.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",2,1749127450.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Does anyone see room for improvement in my situation or have advice for talking to my husband?

We‚Äôve both started new jobs close to home relatively recently. In the mornings, I get out of bed, get ready, unload the dishwasher so bottles/pump parts etc are dry by the time we‚Äôre all home in the afternoon, start or switch a load of laundry, feed the baby while I drink my coffee, prep or gather any miscellaneous things, load my car with lunch/bottles/etc and then head out for daycare drop off everyday but Fridays. My husband makes some French press coffee, gets partially ready, gets the baby up and dressed, drinks his coffee, gets our dogs settled for the day, finishes getting ready and then leaves for work. In the evenings, I arrive home between 4:30-5 and my husband gets home between 4-4:30. He works out for 30 minutes, gets baby ready for dinner and showers while I cook/load pump parts into the dishwasher. We eat as a family, he cleans the highchair, we both play with baby for a little bit if there is time and I do the bath/bedtime routine while my husband finishes any laundry. Usually my husband has retired to the recliner by 7-7:30 and I will finish cleaning the kitchen/prepping bags for the next day. If there is time, I try to squeeze in a workout before I pump at 8:30.

I use Lane Assist when doing long delivers so i can rest and drink some coffee on straight roads.

But some places in the game the truck just pulls randomly and crashes out, it's clear to me that is faulty code of the game, in this case happened twice while passing thru a viaduct entrance.

Then there was a detour on the road and instead of getting the shortest route, i was already distressed by the random crashes that i didn't notice and took the longest route.

Went thru a long uphill (was carrying a Transformer) so i wasted alot of gas and was only going for like 12 mph and got tired as well, forgot to stop to rest and put gas due to already being late and just wanting to finish the job.

Led to doozing out, crashing, but eventually i delivered it.

On top of everything weird that happened, my gas usage was coincidently 666.6 liters.

1l3y45w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dietandhealth/comments/1l3y45w/sabotaged_sleep_always_makes_me_quit/,Sabotaged sleep always makes me quit.,"Ok, I know that deep into a dieting phase your brain and maybe your body will do mental gymnastics to justify you quitting your diet. However, I‚Äôm not new to this and I‚Äôm genuinely curious if anyone here has advice for the situation I‚Äôm going to ask here in a bit. Real quickly, I‚Äôll give some stats; 

I‚Äôm a 30y/o male.

I was a chubby kid, it‚Äôs all I can remember, by the time I turned 16 I weighed 245lbs and was only 5‚Äô 8‚Äù tall. 

I dieted from 16-18 and dropped down to around 200lbs in that time, fantastic. 

From 18-now I started working out regularly, I have no problem enjoying my weight lift sessions and my runs. I legitimately enjoy eating healthy and eat primarily unprocessed foods 85% of the time. With the rare occasional treat. 

I‚Äôve put on quite a bit of muscle and currently weigh 198lbs. However, I‚Äôm still quite chubby, with many extra pounds of fat on me. For my height I should weigh closer to 170. 

When I‚Äôm successful at loosing weight, it‚Äôs through counting my calories and keeping track of macros, and rarely go over a 500 calorie deficit. 

I have been medically diagnosed with insomnia, and have access to strong sleeping medication, but I do not like to take it unless I have multiple bad nights in a row. It‚Äôs addictive and I don‚Äôt drink, smoke, gamble, etc. (my vice is coffee in the morning before noon)

Recently (as in the last two years) whenever I try to diet, it works for about 5lbs, I usually can get down to 190, before my life starts to fall apart. I suddenly can‚Äôt sleep, I feel anxious about going to bed hungry, and if I push my calories allotment all to the latter part of my day so I don‚Äôt go to bed hungry, I will wake up around 4 am with a growling stomach and sleep is out of the question at that point. A week of this or so and I throw in the towel and let myself eat more. Without fail, within about 3-4 days of eating more (not junk food by the way, I simply increase the foods I‚Äôm already eating) I start to sleep better, feel stronger, happier, etc. my life literally turns around. 

Am I forever stuck at 195lbs? Is there a way to break through this weird plateau of weight loss and sleep sabotage? 

TL;DR:
30M with a history of being overweight, currently muscular but still carrying excess fat (~198lbs at 5‚Äô8‚Äù). Enjoys training and eating healthy. Has insomnia and avoids sleep meds unless necessary. Every time he diets and loses about 5lbs, sleep quality crashes, anxiety increases, and he wakes up early with hunger. After resuming normal eating, sleep and mood drastically improve. Asks if there‚Äôs a sustainable way to continue fat loss without triggering sleep and mental health issues.",2,1749127073.0,Dietandhealth,0,1.0,False

During that time I‚Äôve only taken one week off but I‚Äôve been very consistent otherwise. My workout schedule is three days of cardio, two days of weight training and two rest days. This has been great for me as I love to lift and have found a new joy in running too. 

I also eat pretty well. I‚Äôve worked with a dietician in the past so I try to do all the half plate of leafy greens, quarter plate of veggies, etc. I rarely ever drink soda, never super sugary coffees, rarely ever sweets. 

Anyway, my issue is I know I‚Äôm building muscle because in the last few months I‚Äôve been lifting more pounds and also my clothes are fitting slightly better. It hasn‚Äôt been a huge change, but I feel like I‚Äôm getting more tone. With that said, from February to May I gained 12 lbs and then now I‚Äôm at a standstill. It hasn‚Äôt gone up or down for like two weeks. Even the ounces has been exactly the same. 

From last year to February I had lost 30 lbs just eating better so I‚Äôm telling myself the gain is muscle (right?) and look for non scale victories but it‚Äôs also really defeating every time I get on the scale. If I keep building muscle, will I just keep gaining or will it balance out at some point and start to go down again?

They gawked at Jeffrey, wondering how he made that noise, before going back to their documents, no one spotting the reaper perched on the edge of his desk.

Jeffrey sighed, his baggy eyes gazing at the clock on his monitor. 1:05pm. ‚ÄúHa.‚Äù He said, sparing a few seconds for his laughter, before he went straight back to his work, ignoring the bringer of death.

Death had met many worn-out souls, but none this devoid of life. The man more husk, than human, hunched over his keyboard, as if it were a lifejacket in a wavy sea, and he feared if he stopped touching it, he would float away. ‚ÄúGlad you liked the joke, bud, but I really do have a death-line. I mean, shit. A deadline to meet, so as much as I would love to let you finish that report, we kind of have to get moving. Come on, I like to move it, move it.

‚ÄúFinish my reports in a timely manner.‚Äù He sighed again, turning to his clock, noticing it now read 1:06pm. Reluctantly, he pushed his keyboard away, crossing his arms over his thin chest. ‚ÄúAlright, you have five minutes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI only need a few seconds.‚Äù He went to touch Jeffrey, only to stop before his bony finger made contact, sensing a split second of hesitation from the man. Wanting to comfort him, he curled the skeletal finger back into his palm. ‚ÄúWhat troubles you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve wasted my life. I got trapped.‚Äù He said, dragging his hand through the air, pointing to all the office cubicles around him. ‚ÄúThis is all my life ever amounted to.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt call it trapped. You survived. There are worse places to be in life.‚Äù He said, knowing that wouldn‚Äôt help the man at all. No one ever got better by hearing the words. It could always be worse. You couldn‚Äôt understand a worse situation until you lived it, and for him, he was living his worst situation.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there is. I‚Äôll never get to see them, since I‚Äôm dying.‚Äù He sulked, and Death had to admit, Jeffrey had him there. His deadly finger twitched, considering putting the man out of his misery, only for Death to resist a tad longer.

‚ÄúMm. Why did you start working here?‚Äù

‚ÄúHonestly, I thought I could work my way up the ladder. Though, before all this, I wanted to get into acting. Thought I could be a star, or at least a passing meteorite. Then I learnt that passion requires money, and before I knew it, I was here. My family was so happy when I accepted this job. They thought I was getting serious in life, putting aside all that acting nonsense. Even if they said that, I planned to leave this place. Wanting to run off to some party loving paradise in the states where I could rub shoulders with the bigshots. Heh.‚Äù

Death saw the old photos on the man‚Äôs desk, as well as the carefully labelled sticky notes on his computer‚Äôs monitor. All signs that someone didn‚Äôt intend to leave anytime soon. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing that didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù

‚ÄúI kept telling myself. Next year I‚Äôll commit to it. Next year I‚Äôll commit to it. Next year I‚Äôll‚Ä¶. Suddenly I stopped lying to myself about next year. Instead, I thought that by some miracle that I would work my way up the ladder here. That I would find a new meaning in my life. Honestly, what chance did I have of becoming an actor? I couldn‚Äôt even get noticed in the workplace.‚Äù He snickered, accidentally knocking over his cup of coffee, causing the liquid to spill onto the floor, cracking into a hundred tiny pieces.

A few people in the cubicles beside Jeffrey looked up from their monitors in horror, and Jeffrey shook his head. ‚ÄúUnbelievable. I break one coffee cup and they all start death staring me. Death, does life have no meaning?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù He admitted. ‚ÄúSome people say that life‚Äôs meaning is whatever you give it. In truth, some people draw the short straw in life, as unfair as that is. I always felt guilty about that when I was alive. I never had a silver spoon, but I had a shiny bronze one. Then, I just‚Ä¶ lost my love of living.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Jeffrey said, as if he understood the exact feeling, even without understanding exactly what Death meant by that.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be. I‚Äôm enjoying things now. I get to help people find comfort in their last moments. There‚Äôs a beauty in that.‚Äù Death watched the scene behind Jeffrey, tilting his head. ‚ÄúThis is different.‚Äù

Jeffrey flinched as his work colleagues rushed towards his desk. They shoved his chair aside, and at that moment, he realized he hadn‚Äôt even been sitting on a physical chair, instead he had been hovering above it. When he looked down, he found his body sprawled out on the carpet, with the broken cup resting by his head. The rush of a defibrillator had his chest throbbing, and the ethereal form that Death had been talking to grew more pale.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù He tapped at his body, his fingers slipping through it.

‚ÄúA rare second chance. Some souls cling to this earth, and it seems yours defied all odds. You moved the coffee cup with your spirit and got the attention of your colleagues. That heart attack won‚Äôt kill you.‚Äù He rested his hands behind his back, bowing to Jeffrey. ‚ÄúJeffrey, I hope you understand how precious this is.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want it. Someone else deserves it more. Give it to somebody else,‚Äù Jeffrey said, grabbing at the dark robes of Death, who shook his head.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt decide who gets their second chances. I can only observe. Jeffrey, go be a star, and enjoy the lifestyle. Just don‚Äôt party too hard. Unless you want another visit from me.‚Äù Before Jeffrey could respond, he returned to his body, leaving Death looming over him, watching him get saved. ‚ÄúI hope you escape the traps that have ensnared you. Not just in this office, but also mentally. Sometimes the mental cage is the hardest one to break.‚Äù He said, before whistling, leaving the office.

As he left, the people in the office heard a faint ghostly whistling in the air, one that gave the room a small chill before it vanished. When it left, no one could remember exactly how the tune went, and it was quickly forgotten as their full attention returned to Jeffrey.",6,1749126758.0,Sadnesslaughs,0,1.0,False

It never really affected me, when I was a little bit older, 6-7 ish I got bad migraines 5-7 times a year.¬† Then when I was a teen I got more frequent less intense headaches (every other day)¬† on one side. Enough pain to make me need to sit in a dark room for the rest of the afternoon but not as bad as the migraine that I get once a month where they cause me to vomit, see flashing lights and sometimes it started bad on one side of the head and then moved and got way worse on the other. I notice that I get the lesser headaches far more often after school and Idk like my brain just feels like it can‚Äôt think, completely drained.¬†



The weird dots are way more noticeable now. The weird thing is that when I look outside the car window while it‚Äôs moving I am totally fine but looking at a blank wall or paper is like a firework display of microdots. They sometimes create weird patterns and objects stay in my vision for a long time. I‚Äôm not sure if this is normal or not but when I read the sentences and the words start vibrating up and down and get bigger and smaller and merge into each other, I am pretty sure it is normal and I don‚Äôt have dyslexia since the letters don‚Äôt rotate or anything. Also when I stand up first thing in the morning, these dots go wild and cover my entire vision and sometimes I get like a rapid increase of dots that make it go brown, so I can see the corners of objects but they are all brown and multicoloured. Same also happens with my hearing,I hear a high pitch whistle then a bufffff and in 5 minutes its normal again. This has happened to me 3 times in my life and hasn‚Äôt happened in 3 years. It‚Äôs true that headaches run in the family, and my sis is freaky and hallucinates. I don‚Äôt. 



¬†I also get a little bit of tinnitus but I hardly notice that. I visited 2 opthamologist, specifically for a pressure I felt behind my eye and both said my eyes are perfect. I am healthy, fit and tall, I walk, work out, go for runs, sleep decently, sometimes I have lots of exams so not always and my diet is decent and I drink a lot. My blood test is normal‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt smoke, drink, take any drugs or meds or even drink coffee. Its really difficult to get a doc appointment and the waiting time was like 2 years just for someone to effectively say, ‚ÄúNo clue what you got, next please‚Äù so I investigate what this could be, taking everything with a pinch of salt. So does anyone relate to this at all and know what it might be? Am I about to die or am I being melodramatic?

Grifter Sean Feucht‚Äôs House of Cards (and Nine Houses) Comes Crashing Down! You‚Äôre an asshole Sean, you‚Äôre disgusting and a liar","Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround the bonfire of hypocrisy, because Sean Feucht, the self-proclaimed worship leader and Christian Nationalist poster boy, has been caught with his hand in the proverbial cookie jar‚Äîand it‚Äôs a jar labeled ‚Äúmillions in ministry funds.‚Äù This MAGA-aligned, guitar-strumming grifter is now facing accusations of spiritual abuse, financial mismanagement, and‚Äîhold onto your hymnals‚Äîpotential fraud that could make even the slickest televangelist blush. Buckle up, because this tale of greed, deceit, and a parsonage loophole bigger than Feucht‚Äôs ego is a wild ride, and I‚Äôm here to serve it with a side of snark so sharp it could cut through his sanctimonious smirk.
Let‚Äôs start with the headline-grabber: this guy allegedly owns nine homes. Nine! Most people are out here praying for a one-bedroom apartment they can afford, but Sean‚Äôs apparently collecting properties like they‚Äôre Pok√©mon cards. And here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîsome of these are reportedly labeled as tax-exempt ‚Äúparsonages‚Äù under his ministry‚Äôs name. A parsonage, for those not fluent in grift-speak, is supposed to be a humble abode for a minister, not a real estate empire. We‚Äôre talking high-value pads in California and Washington, D.C., including a $3.45 million mansion in San Juan Capistrano and a nearly million-dollar townhouse near the U.S. Capitol called ‚ÄúCamp Elah,‚Äù which, get this, is often empty. Sounds like a holy Airbnb scam to me! Who needs a congregation when you‚Äôve got a portfolio that screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fleecing the faithful‚Äù?
But wait, there‚Äôs more! Former staffers and volunteers‚Äîy‚Äôknow, the folks who actually believed in Feucht‚Äôs ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù crusade‚Äîhave launched a whistleblower website that‚Äôs spilling tea hotter than a megachurch coffee bar. They‚Äôre accusing him of ‚Äúspiritual, emotional, and psychological abuse,‚Äù which is just a fancy way of saying he‚Äôs a manipulative dirtbag who gaslights his team while waving a Bible. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the financial shenanigans: donation diversion, restricted donor fraud, credit card misuse, and‚Äîmy personal favorite‚Äîbulk cash smuggling. Who even smuggles cash in bulk anymore? Is he auditioning for a Christian remake of Narcos? This isn‚Äôt a ministry; it‚Äôs a masterclass in how to exploit faith for profit.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the parsonage loophole, because this is where Feucht‚Äôs slimy brilliance shines. By classifying these luxury properties as ‚Äúparsonages,‚Äù his ministry dodges taxes while he allegedly lives large. Whistleblowers are raising red flags about ‚Äúprivate inurement‚Äù‚Äîa fancy term for using nonprofit funds to bankroll your personal lifestyle. If this isn‚Äôt fraud, it‚Äôs close enough to make the IRS raise an eyebrow. And trust me, when the IRS starts sniffing, it‚Äôs not a question of if you‚Äôre going down, but how hard. Get wrecked, Sean‚Äîyou‚Äôre not outsmarting Uncle Sam with your Jesus-branded hustle.
This guy‚Äôs been parading around as a beacon of righteousness, thumping his chest about Christians ‚Äúruling America‚Äù while hosting maskless worship rallies during COVID. But behind the scenes? He‚Äôs allegedly a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing, preying on the goodwill of his followers to fund his McMansion addiction. The audacity! The hypocrisy! It‚Äôs like he read a ‚ÄúHow to Be a Televangelist‚Äù manual and decided to speed-run it. And the cherry on top? Posts on X are lighting him up, with former allies calling him out for lying, gaslighting, and exploiting donations for personal gain. One user even called for him to be yeeted from leadership entirely. Preach!

Let‚Äôs be real: Sean Feucht doesn‚Äôt belong in ministry. He belongs in a courtroom, preferably one with a judge who‚Äôs allergic to bullshit. The allegations piling up‚Äîabuse, fraud, embezzlement‚Äîare so damning they could make a saint curse. And if there‚Äôs any justice, divine or otherwise, he‚Äôs headed for a reckoning. God‚Äôs got a front-row seat, and I hope He‚Äôs got a lightning bolt with Feucht‚Äôs name on it. This dirtbag‚Äôs been fleecing the flock for too long, and it‚Äôs time for the shepherd to get sheared.

So here‚Äôs to you, Sean Feucht, you sanctimonious swindler. May your nine homes echo with the sound of your crumbling empire, and may your parsonage loophole land you in a cell with no Wi-Fi to tweet your sob story. You‚Äôre not just a grifter‚Äîyou‚Äôre a walking caricature of everything wrong with megachurch mania. Get wrecked, asshole. The truth‚Äôs out, and it‚Äôs uglier than your worship setlist.

1l3xyxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1l3xyxp/it_had_been_a_year_today/,It had been a year today,"On June 05 2024 I drank my last 200ml of Hennessy. So here is my review for one year of sobriety from alcohol. 

Yes, I discovered other sobrieties during this year. Sobriety from sugar. Sobriety from caffeine. Sobriety from overeating. Without getting alcohol free I would have never entered these next levels. 

So how difficult it was/is for me to abstain from alcohol? I would not call it an enormous effort, but it is persistent one. Some days I do not notice it, some days I do feel this weight of life and part of me wants to dissociate and then I remember I do not drink anymore. There is nowhere to hide. So, yes, there are days when I feel naked and exposed and burning in unbearablessness of life. And there are days (not many) when it gets really hard. If it gets to it, I shift. Since I discovered other sobrieties (sugar, caffeine), on a very bad day I shifted to decaffeinated coffee. It still has caffeine content and it wasn‚Äôt my plan to drink it, but it really helped me to withstand the storm of enormous craving which lasted more than a week basically non-stop! 

Throughout my one year journey the hardest times were in the beginning around 30 and 90 days. Then the trip overseas to visit my Mom was unreal. I was triggered with all childhood issues, Mom‚Äôs aging, my country of birth, airports‚Ä¶ But thankfully I stayed put. Lots and lots of caffeine. Thank you for this sub, it gave me strength. 

Still, the hardest times hit at 11 months of sobriety. I completely was unprepared to it and did not know where this storm of craving came from! Out of all my journey, it was more severe than anything I experienced so far! It reminded me how easy it is to slip. 

Addiction IS doing pushups while we are fixing our health! Stay cautious, do not give away your strength!!! 

Life happens. It does. Being sober I realized how sensitive I am to failure, how much fear I carry in me. This fear stays in a way of my relationship with Mom, my husband, my own self! I realized I used to dissociate from it with alcohol. Now I register my fear, it is super unpleasant, but I tell myself ‚Äúokay, just do it, ask this question, open this subject, fix it‚Äù. And when I do, it chips away from the fear. It doesn‚Äôt come back in full again. Next time my fear rises, it is teeny bit less. It is a long road. But it makes tons of sense to keep walking it.

Looking back I realize, I am not the same as when I just started. A year ago I was like a blind kitten. Everything hurt, and everything was intense. Now intensity went down drastically, and I am managing the hurt. 

In terms of looks, vanity gains, I actually looked good when I was drinking, so this somewhat stayed the same. I am only 10 pounds lighter. I cut my hair short, so it is thicker. Overall I look the same, I think. The main change is internal. 

I do suspect the Year 2 will bring me more lessons and more challenges. It is uphill journey for sure, but  it absolutely build self worth. It also made me strong enough to take care of my husband as I am currently the only breadwinner. I am also taking care emotionally of my mother, which I always resisted and dreaded. But now I incorporated 20-30 minutes calls to her in each day during lunch. Yes, it means my lunch time is mostly non-existent, and I dedicate it to something that worry me tons, but I can do it and I am doing it. The rest of my responsibilities are much more simple for me - work, leading a team of scientists to success, these were never scary to me. But having a partner whom I need to provide to, being responsible for my Mom‚Äôs wellbeing were always my scary things for whatever reason. And another my big fear - taking care of the house! I married a guy who never does it, so it is also on me. This year I cleaned all the cabinets, addressed my fear of potential leak in the bathroom and faced the renovation, which wasn‚Äôt fun considering we live only on my salary. I cleaned all the closets, established a routine of daily maintenance of the house. I started watching my husband‚Äôs diet. Addressed his blood sugar levels. Incorporated cooking for him to pull him to better health. Everything I wanted to hide away from.  I stare those fears right in the face every day all the time. And I am grateful that my fears are not the worst God could give to us. 

It is not the sparkly journey, but it could have been if started early in life!! 

Thank you again for your stories, experiences, for being here, for your fight for life. Let‚Äôs keep increasing our odds. 

Let‚Äôs win!

In a pretty unique situation as a recent philosophy graduate (23m) and I‚Äôm looking for some advice. I graduated last year from Cardiff uni and decided to stay in the city instead of moving back home to Birmingham. Due to extenuating circumstances, I disappointingly finished with a 2:2 and I have spent the past few months working two part time jobs in hospitality hoping to find full-time work.

However, I have yet to find a clear path to a career in an industry I would be happy to be in. I have found it difficult to find my niche whilst balancing working in hospitality to pay the bills.

My partner has just recently accepted a grad role in the middle of Dorset and is set to move in September. Her accommodation is provided by her employer and I have the option of moving with her. All utility and rent is covered and I would have the freedom to explore my interests and goals.

The downside to this move is that I would be moving from a city with a growing creative scene and culture to a small town in the countryside. The nearest city is Bournemouth and would be a 40 min drive and Bristol would be a 1hr 40min drive.

The career path that I will choose is still unclear but I have a few possible avenues in mind.

I am a creative person at heart. I love music and events and I‚Äôve gone to 30+ gigs and concerts of all kinds of music. I even did a bi-weekly radio show in uni showcasing a variety of different genres. I‚Äôd love to find a role within the music industry and I believe that this industry could be where I could find my dream role.

I also love fashion. Collecting vintage and designer pieces has been a routine of mine since I was a teenager. I have a distinct style, know what I like and I keep my tabs on what is in style. I would equally love a career in fashion but I haven‚Äôt found an opportunity to break into this space.

Whilst I had seen opportunities in the Cardiff creative industry, I found it difficult to manage this whilst working two jobs and the financial pressure I faced was, at times, overwhelming.

I doubt that these two options would be viable in an area without a thriving creative scene. I also have an interest in marketing but I have yet to start a portfolio.

I have also considered going all-in on learning how to code but the doom and gloom that I see online about the tech job market has deterred me from this.

I have 5 years+ of strong hospitality experience, from specialty coffee to craft beer to ‚Äòspoons, so I have no doubt that I could find a part-time job in the area. This would give me much needed time for personal development as I‚Äôm looking to take advantage of the easing of financial pressures with this move.

18 years ago I woke up as dizzy as ever. Husband rushed me to the Dr and was given a small dose of cortisone and nausea meds and sent home. 
Found out later that actually when you suspect any vestibular issues, the first thing you must do is get on a high course of cortisone to prevent too much inflammation which can cause damage. 
I, however, didn‚Äôt get given that so ended up with vestibular nerve damage and years of hell, BUT, there is a silver lining. It took going to every specialist under the sun but the thing that was my saving grace was: VRT, antidepressants & benzodiazepines for the really bad days. 
After 8-9 years of hell I got my life back. 
Opened a dancing studio - yes, could dance and teach again. Flew overseas twice. Shopping centres etc etc. So there is hope. 

Fast forward to the present, and this is where I need your support now, 7 weeks ago I walked to my kitchen to make coffee and turned to look at my kettle and my brain carried on whooshing in my head. I panicked to the point of having a panic attack and fainting due to the fear of the past. 
Went to the ER and got the right meds - high dose of cortisone & antivirals. Felt terrible on the meds which had me spiral into a severe depression to the point of being admitted to a clinic. 
I‚Äôm back home and have to climb that mountain again - but just so depressed and anxious that I‚Äôm almost stuck in a hole. Suffering terribly with PTSD. 

I‚Äôm on SSNI, stress pills and beta blockers but my anxiety is hectic. Doing VRT again too. 

What are you all on? What meds and how do you find it in yourselves to get back on the horse and put in the work again? Really struggling emotionally as my husband has since passed away so I‚Äôm alone this time around. My kids are being amazing & so supportive but I worry about how this is affecting them too.

# ‚ùì Does it work on mobile?

**Yes, but desktop is better.**  
It‚Äôs web-based and works on tablets or phones, but for the best experience, especially editing and mockups, use a desktop.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Considerations & Copyright Limitations

Like all AI-generated content platforms, **Artistly AI** operates in a legal gray area when it comes to **ownership and copyright**. While the platform gives you broad commercial rights, here‚Äôs what you need to know to stay safe and compliant.

# üßæ 1. Can You Claim Copyright on AI-Generated Art?

**In most countries: No.**  
AI-generated content (including that made with Artistly AI, DALL¬∑E, or Midjourney) typically **cannot be copyrighted** in your name unless there‚Äôs clear human authorship involved (like detailed post-editing or prompt engineering).

So while you can **use and sell** the images freely, you usually **can‚Äôt register them as your original copyrighted work.**

# üíº 2. Can You Sell the Images?

**Yes.**  
Artistly AI grants you a **full commercial license** to:

* Sell prints, digital downloads, or merchandise
* Use the images in client projects
* Publish books or marketing materials
* Create websites, ads, or branding materials

‚úÖ You keep 100% of the profit.  
‚ùå You can‚Äôt claim legal authorship in court (in most jurisdictions).

# üõë 3. What Are You Not Allowed to Do?

Artistly AI **prohibits** the use of:

* **Celebrity names or faces**
* **Copyrighted characters, logos, or brands**
* **Prompts that mimic copyrighted artwork or styles** (e.g. ‚ÄúMickey Mouse in the style of Van Gogh‚Äù)

Doing so could open you up to **legal issues**, especially on marketplaces like Etsy or Amazon.

# üìñ 4. What About Book Publishing?

You can publish **children‚Äôs books, coloring books, and illustrated content** using Artistly AI. Just make sure:

* You **don't use trademarked characters**
* You clarify that the artwork is **AI-generated** if required by your publishing platform
* You own the rights to your prompts and content

Amazon KDP, for example, now asks if your book uses AI-generated content ‚Äî be honest when prompted.

# ü§ù 5. Is the License Transferable?

**No.**  
Your license is **personal-use only**, even though you can sell outputs. You can‚Äôt resell access to the tool or license someone else to use your account.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Legal Checklist:

|‚úÖ You Can|‚ùå You Can't|
|:-|:-|
|Sell designs, books, and merch|Use celebrity faces or names|
|Offer freelance design services|Claim legal copyright|
|Monetize images on Etsy, KDP, etc.|Resell the software license|
|Publish AI-generated books|Use known characters (Disney, Marvel, etc.)|

# üß™ Final Verdict: Is Artistly AI Worth It?

If you‚Äôre looking for a fast, beginner-friendly, and insanely cost-effective way to generate visual content ‚Äî **Artistly AI is a beast.** It‚Äôs not just an image generator. It‚Äôs a **complete creative suite** for entrepreneurs, freelancers, authors, educators, and side hustlers who want to build and monetize content at scale.

# üî• Why It‚Äôs Worth It

* **Pay once, use forever** ‚Äî no subscriptions, no credits, no restrictions
* **All-in-one tool** ‚Äî image generation, editing, mockups, books, branding
* **Built for monetization** ‚Äî from Etsy to KDP to client services
* **Perfect for non-designers** ‚Äî type a prompt, get results
* **Includes commercial rights** ‚Äî full freedom to sell what you create
* **Real-time value** ‚Äî pays for itself with your first product or client project

# üëé What Might Hold You Back

* No free trial (but the 30-day refund helps)
* Slight polish sometimes needed on mockups or inpainting
* Not ideal for ultra-artsy or experimental visuals (Midjourney still wins there)

# üß† Who Should Grab This?

‚úÖ **Yes, if you are:**

* A small business owner or solopreneur
* A freelancer offering design or content services
* An Etsy, Redbubble, or Amazon KDP seller
* A content creator or course builder
* An author creating visual stories or illustrations

‚ùå **Skip it if you:**

* Need ultra-stylized, abstract art
* Prefer manual control over every design element
* Want free access before committing

# üí¨ Final Call:

**Artistly AI is what Canva+Midjourney+PlaceIt would look like if they had a one-time-payment baby.**  
If you‚Äôre even remotely creative ‚Äî this tool will save you money, time, and creative headaches.

I just want to say thank you for any help that can be given. The focus here is what I am to say for my appeal court date for unemployment. My unemployment was denied, which I appealed. 

I need unemployment help desperately. I live in Massachusetts and I was employed by a very very big mattress corporation  where I was recently terminated. I genuinely loved and cared about my job, and was constantly telling my coworkers how I was looking to be in management someday. I had no intention to fall asleep while at work, and made sure to have coffee and food that day because I was feeling so not well. 

My unemployment was denied. I had already spoke with them on the phone and told them how I had fallen asleep at the desk and no meaning to fall asleep. The truth is I fell asleep on a mattress. I worked at a mattress store, but I do want to leave this section out when further speaking on the case but I know it will come up during my court case. I need to win this. I had no other issues at my job. The only other time I was even ‚Äúwritten up‚Äù was over dress-code, which me and my District manager speaked privately about how I was always well dressed and professional, and the past manager who gave me the write up went against what he had seen from me. 

I‚Äôve been not the smartest. I‚Äôm ashamed at how I fell asleep. The night before my old cat was throwing up horribly, which she has done for years now and I took her to the vet for before I moved to MA (it‚Äôs just hairballs). But truly, I couldn‚Äôt call off. We were so understaffed and I work alone in the mornings. 

It was always hard to take lunches at my job or take a break when alone. Throughout my 2 years at this mattress store I never took a lunch off the clock, and would have to eat my food in less than 5 minutes to help with customers. 

What can I do to win my case? It‚Äôs in less than a week and I don‚Äôt have the money to get a lawyer to represent me. Thank you ",1,1749126202.0,AskALawyer,1,1.0,False
