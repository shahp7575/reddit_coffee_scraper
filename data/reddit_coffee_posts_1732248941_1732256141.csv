One small, everyday decision can completely alter your day or even your life. Imagine stopping for coffee on your way to work, delaying you by just a minute. That delay could be the reason you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time, like an intersection where a car runs a red light.

It’s wild to think how small, seemingly insignificant choices can lead to major outcomes. The randomness of life can bring both incredible opportunities and unexpected challenges.

You can plan everything perfectly, but chance still plays a huge role. Maybe the key is to accept the chaos, control what you can, and let go of the rest. Do you ever think about how different things might’ve been if one small thing had changed?

1gx15qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1gx15qj/please_help_found_more_evidence_and_older/,Please help. Found more evidence and older evidence that points to infidelity.,"Hi all, I made a post a couple of days ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1gvfh6g/partner_suspected_of_cheating/), but left out some details as I thought they were irrelevant at the time. 

However, additional evidence has come to light since then that points to everything being related. I also found additional evidence that's even more glaring than the other things I found when I made my first post.

To summarize, my relationship has been lacking intimacy, emotional, and physical connection I would say for the past 2 years or so. I've brought up our issues multiple times mostly in a calm manner throughout the years, and he would always chalk it up to low libido, stress from work, and/or lack of emotional connection from me due to our occasional arguments. I would try to help alleviate his stress and made a solid effort to minimize our arguments and have learned to express my feelings in a very non-confrontational manner since then.

Fast forward to a few months ago, he went on many business trips and some for leisure (bachelor party, wedding, his friends' birthday celebrations) abroad. During his trips and when he'd be back, I'd notice that communication would be sparse and mostly curt. For example he would hardly use ""babe"" or would be short/dry with his words via text and hasn't even told me he loves me. He used to do this daily. I also noticed that the lack of physical connection has been more apparent. No more hugs, unless I hug him first. No physical touch whatsoever while we're on the couch watching TV. No good nights. No occasional cuddles. The only form of affection I would get is a peck on the lips before he leaves for work. I always thought that it was for the same reasons he mentioned in the past, so I left it alone...

Until a few days ago. I was watching videos on his YouTube account which is connected to our TV. I typed in ""te"" and saw 2 thumbnails of sex toys for men. One was something along the lines of ""Watch this before you buy Tenga Spinner"" and the other was a Tenger Spinner Review. I also found ""how to use Tenga Spinner"" in his YT search history. When I saw this, I felt insecure because we basically have a sexless relationship, and I felt like the toy was replacing me.

I calmly talked to him that night to ask him what's going on, and he said on his trip to Japan during his friend's bachelor party, he and his friends went to a sex shop and he said that his friend told him to watch these videos. I then asked him very calmly if he bought it, to which he immediately said ""no"". I then asked him if he was still attracted to me, and he said ""yes"". I left it at that and everything seemed fine.

I thought that was the end of it. He went on another business trip 3 days ago, and when he left, I got curious and went into his YT watch history and found a couple of videos that made my heart sink. ""Escort/Hooker services in Orchard Tower"" and ""Walk around Orchard Tower many pretty girls"". Orchard Tower is supposedly a mall building that is a red light district at night. I checked his YT search history and found ""Orchard Tower Singapore"", so I thought maybe he searched it and those two videos were part of the top results, but that doesn't explain why he had to click on them and watch them until the end which means it wasn't an accidental click.

Again, I thought that was the end of it, and planned to ask him about it when he would return from his trip. However, that night, as I was walking around our room, I noticed a white cylindrical, plastic case in plain site on the floor by the corner of a clothing rack. I picked it up, and it said ""Tenga"", so he lied to me. I specifically asked him about it before he left, and he straight up said no. More than anything, I was devastated and disappointed that he lied, and I was also hurt that instead of actively working to revive our sex life as I've asked of him many times and even provided solutions that would help, he would instead purchase a toy that would most likely perpetuate our sexless relationship.

As if that wasn't enough, the same night I was actively looking around our place, and lo and behold, on an old coffee table tucked in a corner, underneath a luggage strap, there were 2 condoms - one Durex one with a purple wrapper which we used to use when we were still having sex and another Durex one with a pink wrapper that I've never seen before. I flipped it, and saw 2027-4 as the expiration date which means it's brand new. I felt gutted. It doesn't make sense that he would use it for us as we haven't been intimate and it also doesn't make sense because we have plenty of the purple wrapper ones leftover. My theory is that he used this new one during one of his trips or had the intention of using it. Maybe he used several, and stupidly brought back the 1 leftover condom.

A few weeks before all of this, there was also an empty KY Jelly lubricant box in one of our plastic shopping bags. I asked him about it immediately since he was there, and he told me that it was jumbled in with a bunch of things that he took from his pharmacy business that was closing. I think the part that he got it from his pharmacy is believable, but I don't believe that an empty box just fell in there with the other stuff. However, I took his word for it, and left it alone. Now I'm connecting the dots and thinking the lube was either for his sex toy or to use on an actual person, perhaps an escort(s) while he was in Singapore and/or Japan.

Everyone online has advised to wait until I can find concrete evidence that confirms his infidelity as cheaters will deny and get better at hiding things, but it's been eating away at me these past 2 days - I can barely eat or sleep. I also don't think I can find any concrete evidence as I don't have his phone and laptop passwords. I think obtaining them would be hard.

Should I be patient and wait until I can gain access to his phone or should I go ahead and ask him about all of this when he gets back?

If so, how should I go about the conversation and how would I order my findings? I basically want to paint a picture that while all of these are not concrete evidence, together they create a bigger picture that points to infidelity and loss of attraction towards me.

My biggest fear is that he'll deny it, come up with very convincing innocent explanations for all of them, and then I'd believe him, stay in the relationship, not knowing that he would continue this behavior possibly even until we're married or have kids. At that point it would be harder to leave.

I'll preface this by saying i don't have a good nose but i definitely still managed to get gists of what each of these offer, Complete newbie at this so do judge me wherever and whenever apt.

https://preview.redd.it/tx41i3n7wd2e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65695d26d958320fa2a8f8208170e512c16f8180

Rasasi hawas ice, Got this from u/oofEmil, One of my first few decants which i ordered as i took some recommendations from him for college, Before going to college i was in a place that was quite cool and dry so this would easily last me a good 4-5 hrs on my clothes ( I exclusively used it underarms during my early stages of this addiction ) It has a sweet bubblegummy like taste which as the seller suggested me is good for daily wear in college but the location i ended up in for my studies is really humid and hot so it'll wear off in 3 hrs max, Overall i would give it a 7 out of 10

https://preview.redd.it/2x60w1c6xd2e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d55cefc5e27577b01ad7353fd8fdb0d040129673

Another purchase from u/oofEmil , Both came securely packed and had no issues at all with any of them breaking, Though i'd say the atomiser on hawas was problematic.

Versace Eros EDP - A must have for parties and definitely a mass pleaser, my mom complemented it saying it smells exactly like the aroma around in the high end malls but then again that way it's really mainstream and popular, wouldn't really stand out with this, notes i don't smell anything special it just smells fresh and hints of citrus, An easy 8/10 for me

  
Later i order 2 more decants for trying out even more designers, I placed an order with u/oofEmil again for the following two  


https://preview.redd.it/1f4xnyw7yd2e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ee5a1921fbabbcde9fe7d8fe04646f0f0a53db1

As visible, Tube isn't reaching the ends so I'm still figuring out how to use it frugally because it is really good

Armani Stronger with you, A perfume that feels and smells holy, I don't know how i would put it but it's a really good frag for formal occasions in my opinion, It gives off that royal type of vibe, as for notes i cannot really say a whole lot.. I'd give it a 6/10 though because it is highly occasional for me atleast, it smells good none the less.

https://preview.redd.it/94a4vvtyzd2e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=417c5a7e84cf6393fb4352038bf3ea29d0eca887

This concludes the 2nd set of my decants

Yvue saint laurant's Y parfum, Originally was planning to go with the popular EDP but ended up with this as i was tempted for the lavender notes, When it arrived i was kind of disappointed, It has a very subtle lavender note or it only is to my nose.  
It is as fresh and good though as eros edp is, So i'll be able to it an easy 7-8/10, You could say it basically is the eros edp with the lavender notes in a way

That was all from u/oofEmil

  
Next I ordered a set of these three

https://preview.redd.it/ueaz0zsz0e2e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=094a283c6f9cde6b32e15cd5f98c2ec07a6bd25f

All from [u/jasonlobo22](https://www.reddit.com/user/jasonlobo22/)

Looking at other decant bottles compared to these the atomizer does feel a tad bit cheap but i'll really vouch for the prices he has, The collection he has, It in itself is a huge thing like 300 of those for you to pick and go through, Definitely will be coming back for more ( Help me ), His packaging is top notch, never ending rolls of bubble wrap to make sure your perfumes won't end up cracking or any minor damage at all

Let's start with Lattafa khamrah

  
As my friends described, it's really sweet and spicy, an arousing perfume if you will, I personally wouldn't want to use it as much on which ill continue further down, It has a really good vanilla projection too, this is one of the loud projecting ones, 

longevity in hot and humid - 1-2hrs

easy 9/10

  
Next we have Lattafa Ramz silver

  
Not much to say to be honest, the initial sprays start to sting a lot and later on it becomes sweet, so definitely not a perfume to apply if you're in a hurry as you'll need to let it settle, It's really good don't get me wrong but the initial stinging it causes is annoying. High projection it has though.

longevity in hot and humid - 1 hr

8/10 for me

  
Finally the popular davidoff coolwater edt

I've longed for this about 4 months now and never made my mind on if i should or shouldn't get it because on one hand it's really mainstream and popular but on the other it's a good ""price to performance"" for the aromatic and fresh type of notes, It basically is eros edp for me without partying part, Not citrusy, Fresh out of the ocean it seems, Totally worth it

longevity - 

  
9/10

  
Now my final batch of decants as of now ( Please help me )

From u/Mebankai, As he describes i don't think decanting is his main thing but damn does he have a good collection too, Prices seemed quite fair as well and if it comes to handling the delivery, thanks to his planning and packaging, even after my box was torn open or something which i couldn't quite figure out, the perfumes came just alright without any damage so I'm glad he did good on his part

  
Coming to the haul, 

First we have Versace Eros Flame

https://preview.redd.it/jxttr9uu4e2e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05a3e86eebbc1ce4da4582b21d6b80176d68d0db

How will i miss this one out after looking at people be so critical towards something like this, it is one of my most favorite ones, Like even as an unpopular opinion i'd put this out, It's objectively better than eros edp, The citrusy opening it has with which it turns sweet in a few is just magical, my friends described it as just getting out of shower type of feel, A good 4-5 hr lasting perfume

  
another 9/10

  
Next we have Dolce&Gabbana's light blue eau intense pour homme

https://preview.redd.it/qy3cqxoq5e2e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5074c21fd96f3e417dc73e11e30af5ea5d22706e

Hands down the best fresh/aquatic perfume i have at the moment, Not that i have a lot but it basically feels like a better coolwater edt if you get what i mean, A worthy blind buy if you will, Projection is medium and longevity goes for 3 hrs to 4 in this hot and humid environment, Totally worth it if you have the budget get this else the coolwater edt

10/10 for me

  
Next up is my most favorite one with massive longevity compared to other perfumes here

Mancera amore caffe

https://preview.redd.it/4l5ugavz6e2e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a938d962f6a064945c19752b61b3fbd8ec7c3c0b

While ordering it sounded so good in my head as i was scrolling through fragrantica but i was just dumbfounded and shocked to found how good it is in real life, I wouldn't say one should wear it daily but i personally would definitely do it. The smell of coffee and vanilla is sooo well blended this perfume got many people's attention, someone even was asking who's having a chocolate right now in the elevator, the projection is simply really good and loud, At no point is it annoying, Everyone was instantly pleased, My friends called this one of those panty dropped perfumes if you will, A blind buy for me personally and lasts like 7 hours in this environment i don't know how it manages to but yes the projection does fall off after 3 hours or so

11/10 hell i'd give it more and it'd still be less



Now the final one, Versace dylan blue

https://preview.redd.it/wg16oc427e2e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d533a0e98b9a98af63c1c43f404f40e6259625dd

Not really thaaat interesting to me personally, Didn't really find it interesting.

has a main amber note that sure is easily noticable but again, not my type. It also ended up being a disappointment like the Y parfum where the public hyped it up for me but didn't live upto the hype. seemed like a fresh perfume forced to be musky, ambery\~, manly if it makes any sense

  
7/10 from me

Thanks to all the three sellers, Definitely gonna have a final haul before i finalize ( Don't we all say that T-T )",4,1732255229.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

Out of all the commonly used retailers to get cigars from overseas, I’m chasing this one cigar that’s like an independent or new (you could say, launched late last year) that hasn’t really reached any shelves for mass export. Is there a way to get very specific brands that isn’t commonly sold in main retailers? If you have, how did you manage to do that? 

Also I have considered messaging a mate over there to mail me a box and or a small 10 pack of these cigars (seperately), wrap em up with Christmas wrapping with a note (“early present”) and tell him to send it around Christmas when the flux of packages coming through is high on the off chance it would be less likely to get flagged. And even if it does all I have to do it pay the tax or excise on it? If I’m not mistaken, which I’m willing to do of course. Any advice on that? Is that a solid plan? And what should I look out for if I do?

I am very new and want to start my cigar hobby. I will be buying from Neptune soon and roll the dice on that also. Also I’m going to Cuba for a 10 day trip and I’ll definitely be trying to sneak back a few and also cuban rum and Cuban coffee if I can.

Trust me. ","I’ve seen a few dads post recently that they were struggling with their crying newborns to the extent that they felt the urge to shake their baby. No judgment. It’s a real thing and it’s a difficult place to be, especially for those of us dads who had infants who cried non stop. 

What saved me were my AirPods. For the first 6 months my partner and I did shifts. She slept at night, and I stayed up with our son. At 6 or 7 in the morning she’d wake up, take over, and I’d sleep 5 or 6 hours. He’d cry a good 4 hours of the time I had him. At some point, after the first week home with him, I popped in my AirPods. I felt guilty at first, as if I wasn’t really there with him. But it was better than the alternative. 

I started season 1 episode 1 of Seinfeld on my phone, set it face down on the coffee table, and held my son and bounced him while he cried. Sure it didn’t block out all the sounds of his crying, but with the volume all the way up, and my AirPods jammed deep in my ears, it was enough to focus on the dialogue and distract my brain from the crying.

It was a game changer. It made me a better dad. It let me hold my son close through all those nights, and stave off the impending feelings of rage that hours and hours of screaming can bring on. 

It let my partner sleep longer, because I never needed her to tap in. Sure there were nights it’s still got really, really hard, but it was manageable. I got through the first season of Seinfeld just listening (it’s all dialogue driven so it worked) then I moved on to audio books. 

I can’t stress it enough. If you’re struggling with a crying baby get some good Bluetooth headphones. I recommend AirPod Pros,
because they come with multiple sizes of rubber tips, and they sound pretty decent.  But the important thing here is a good air seal in your ear canal. That’s what’s gonna block out the crying. The hard plastic headphones don’t seal tight enough, and noise canceling will do nothing in this situation. If AirPod Pros are out of your price range, any Bluetooth headphone with rubber ear tips (preferably in multiple sizes so you can get the tightest fit) will work. The drivers don’t matter, we’re not going for audio quality here. As long as they make a good seal in your ear canal and get decently loud, they’ll work. 

I recommend having several shows, podcasts, or audio books cued up and ready to go. At dinner time I’d get all my listening material sorted, so that when my shift started, all I had to do was open an app and hit play. 

Good luck dads. A crying baby is hard. But it’ll pass soon enough, and then you’ll have an insane toddler to manage. AirPods won’t help you there - let me know if you figure out what works.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/i_caught_my_twin_doing_something_but_she_says_its/)**: September 27, 2024**

Okay so I’m 15 and a female, but the one with symptoms is my twin sister who is also 15. We are fraternal if that makes a difference. She’s 5’5.5 and she was 135 pounds at the start of cross country season when we got our physicals but she’s visibly smaller now and I don’t know what she weighs anymore. For medical history, she gets migraines and has medicine for that.

So we are twins and we look super similar, it’s obvious we are twins, but I’ve always been shorter and skinnier. I was a lot smaller than her at birth and basically never caught up lmao. But that’s the only real difference physically. She always liked being the taller one because she’s 3 minutes older too. When we got our physicals in July though, she got super upset that I weighed 113 pounds and she was 135. She’s also two and a half inches taller than me though and the doctor said our weights were totally perfect. The doctor could tell she was upset and told her not to worry about her weight because she looks beautiful and she’s healthy, and she said she wasn’t worried but I could tell she was lying. And honestly the night before we had eaten at this Greek restaurant with massive portions and it was probably poop weight. Not to be gross. But yeah.

A couple days later she asked our mom to buy grapefruit. Our mom is well meaning and overall a really good mom but she did modeling when she was younger and she’s a complete almond mom. Like she’s always on a diet and talking about how fat she is when she’s not. So she was super happy that Isabel wanted to eat healthier. Isabel explained this whole diet plan of only eating good foods and being super healthy. It sounded stupid to me but I wanted to be supportive. She said she wanted to get to 125. Which her weight before was fine but that was still pretty reasonable so I tried to be supportive.

She went unhinged. She started watching nutrition influencers on TikTok and insta. So she started off eating this diet of grapefruit and coffee for breakfast, a salad and half a cup of dry cheerios at lunch, and grilled chicken breast with honey mustard and grapes for dinner. After like two weeks of this I found her in our closet eating an entire sleeve of Oreos and a plate of nachos and a tortilla covered in melted chocolate chips, and she was sobbing. I told her she wasn’t eating enough and that’s why her brain made her do that. I helped her clean up and we went for a walk and I thought she was done with the diet, but then she was searching “how to prevent binges” which lead her to following this instagram model named Caroline Deisler, or something like that. Anyway she’s a vegan and then my sister decided this is her goal body and she’s going to be vegan too. My mom was super supportive of this. Over the last two months the amount she’s eating keeps getting less and less. Now she’s living off almost exclusively fruit and honey roasted almonds and coconut yogurt, with the occasional lemon juice and olive oil salad. She told my mom she doesn’t want “bad” food in the house. This sucks for me because I don’t want to live off of rabbit food, but also I’m really worried about my sister.

Shes doing some really weird stuff with her food. She chews everything so long it must be paste, she uses tiny plates for everything and refuses to eat off red or yellow plates, and she spends ages arranging her food in patterns. She won’t eat if she can’t drink water with it. She also barely goes to stuff with our friends and me anymore and she says it’s because she’s tired or has homework but she mostly avoids things that involve eating so I feel like that’s probably what she’s actually doing. Her times at cross country keep getting worse instead of better and she looks miserable when we’re running and she’s so angry lately, and I’m pretty sure it’s because she’s hungry. I keep telling my mom I think something isn’t right and she tells me jealousy is an ugly look.

So this all leads us to last Friday. We were at a football game with friends, and I forgot to charge my phone. I wanted to show one of our friends the dress I was wearing for homecoming because she wasn’t in the group chat, so I took my sisters phone. I opened her pictures to find the dress and there were pictures of her that she took in her underwear but they didn’t look like nudes, it was like she was trying to see how bony she was. And she looks awful. But I knew she would be embarrassed if our friend saw this and so I closed out of photos and opened safari to just Google the store I bought the dress at and it opened to this forum about eating disorders. I pretended I didn’t see it, I looked up the dress, and then I gave my sister her phone and tried not to act weird all night. So then in bed later I looked the site up.

It’s awful. It’s seriously awful. It’s people talking about losing weight and having competitions and posting their skinny bodies and wanting to be unhealthy. They share tips on not eating and eating less and not getting caught. I don’t know what my sisters username was, I didn’t have time to see so I couldn’t find her profile, but no one on the site was healthy. I was crying reading it because it’s freaking awful.

So the next day when we were walking home from the gas station I offered her some of my bar, and she said no. I asked again and she said no, she just wanted her Celsius. And I told her I thought she needed to eat something. She flipped out at me and told me to stop being pushy and weird and I told her I found the website. At first she said she was researching for a school project and I was like “Izzy what project we have all the same classes”. She got super pissed at me and she’s barely been talking to me all week and said if I tell anyone she’ll never talk to me again.

I looked up eating disorders. I’m not trying to make this about me but it says they can be really bad for you and make you infertile. It looks like a big deal. And not eating can kill you right? People die of that. I’ve been an absolute mess for the last week thinking about this. She’s ignoring me acting like everything is fine and eating almost nothing.

I’m sorry this got so long. I just don’t know what to do…she told me to let it go because she’s fine and just being healthier and she’ll increase her food when cross country season is done because she can’t run if she’s full. But that sounds…stupid. She told me everyone diets, our mom has literally always been in a diet, pretty much everyone in our friend group has been on a diet or tried to lose weight and I’m overreacting. This is the only place I knew I could ask doctors about this without having to tell them who I am.

Could this make my sister sick or even kill her? Is it my fault because I’m smaller and she felt bad? How can I help her? She’s so angry and so mean lately and I’m really scared for her. I don’t want her to get hurt but I also don’t want her to hate me.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: if your mother won't help with this I'd get another trusted family member to help as well. This can be dangerous and sounds like an ED. You're a great sister for worrying about her and seeking help.

>**OOP:** Is it dangerous enough to call our dad over? He’s like a Christmas/birthday dad

Commenter: \[...\] You said your dad is a Christmas dad so I don't know how he can help being so far away but I'd consider reaching out to dad if your mom is unreasonable or minimizes what's happening.

>**OOP:** That’s the worst part he’s not far away- we just only see him on our birthday and Christmas lmao. He lives like 2 miles away. I’ll try to find a time to talk to my mom when my sister isn’t around. The times I’ve brought it up when she’s around in the past they both accuse me of being dramatic and jealous. Plus my sister threatened to tell our mom I’ve vaped a couple times if I brought it up again 😬

Commenter: You need to find another adult that's dependable. It doesn't sounding your dad is that present in your life

It doesn't sound like your mom cares enough or is too ignorant or just wants to cover her eyes and pretend everything is OK

>**OOP:** My parents are super young and kind of immature. They’re both 33 and 32 so I try not to be too hard on them…like at least they didn’t delete us I guess? But also I kind of think maybe my mom has problems too and actually thinks it’s normal? I’ve just been really anxious trying to figure this out and I’m afraid something bad will happen to my sister if she keeps doing this

Commenter: I don't blame you at all but they need to fucking grow the fuck up and be parents. You say you're 15.... so your parents had you at 18 and 17 respectively and I am assuming they are divorced or never married since they don't live together and your deadbeat \[and I'm being kind here\] dad isn't around enough to notice the problem or care. \[...\]

>**OOP:** They’re not really bad or abusive but I think my mom almost sees us more like we’re all the same age than that she’s our mom? But yeah I really wish she’d be more of an adult at least for this

Commenter: Do you have any other adults in your life that you trust that could help? An aunt or uncle, grandparents or teacher?

>**OOP:** We don’t talk to my mom’s side of the family since we were like 5. My dad’s parents we know but not super well. But they’re not bad or anything so I think they might help. My sister seems like she really likes our math teacher. Would it be weird if told her?

Commenter: I feel this. I'm a twin too, we are identical. My sister has had a lot of ups and downs with her mental health and it's the worst feeling to be there seeing it and not be able to fix it. Wondering why is she hurting so much when I am (comparatively) ok? Thinking that if I just tried harder I could somehow save her from this. It's not fair, but know that you can't fix this for her, you can just be there supporting her as she goes through treatment.

>**OOP:** Yes that’s exactly it. Like I feel so guilty that she’s having this issue and I’m not… and then I wonder if it’s genetic and I’ll end up like that too? I don’t want to. And usually she’s always been honest with me and we don’t have secrets but she’s pulling away and saying we need space and our own lives now…

**OOP:** Tonight she’s been using this stepper thing to step up and down while we are watching a show and I didn’t say anything because I don’t want to make her suspicious or more mad, but then she kind of tripped on it and sat down and put her head in her lap and said she was going to throw up. I had her lay down and got her some water and a bucket but she’s all sweaty and said she doesn’t feel good and thinks she has a stomach thing…but could this be from her not eating? Is there a different way to help if she’s sick than if it’s because of the eating stuff? I was rubbing her back and it’s all bumpy and boney and I’m really freaked out

*Blood sugar:*

Our mom is asleep. I had to argue with her to get her to suck on a jolly rancher. Hopefully it helps the blood sugar thing if that’s it

**Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpf4qv7/:)**: 7 hours later, about 24 from OG post**

**OOP:** Earlier this afternoon my sister fainted like a half hour after she took a shower and she wasn’t answering or waking up and so I freaked out and called an ambulance and she woke up by the time they got there but she couldn’t see anything at first and she hit her head. So now she’s mad at me and won’t let me see her and my moms mad because she said we could’ve just made a doctor appointment if I told her instead of going over her head and making a scene but I knew this was bad. And I know it’s horrible but I hope they don’t let her leave the hospital until she’s better. Thanks for answering my questions. I probably would’ve been too scared to call 911 otherwise. I knew she wasn’t okay.

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: You absolutely, unequivocally, did the right thing.  

If you are able to, I think it might be a good idea to reach out to the team that is seeing your sister and disclose this information. If you are worried about your relationship with her, you can ask them to please not tell her that you said this. She may very well try to hide her recent weight loss and her eating habits from her doctors, and it is incredibly important that they know about this. They may already suspect it or know it based on her presentation, but having your collateral information will be very helpful

>**OOP:** The doctors at the hospital you mean? The paramedics asked me what happened and I told them I think she’s not eating on purpose and she’s lost a lot of weight. Would they know because of that or would I have to tell them again? Also the paramedics said her pulse was low, and her blood pressure. I don’t remember the blood pressure numbers but her pulse was 41. Is that why she fainted?

Commenter: Her heart rate is likely due to nutrition issues and low electrolytes. Either way I'm glad you called the ambulance and took her to the hospital

You're handing this as well as you can and saved her life.

Where are your parents in this? Surely they must know now.

>**OOP:** My mom knows. She’s here too. I called my dad and he was mad no one told him sooner

**Comment** [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lph1fmd/:)**: September 29, 2024 (Next day, day and a half from OG post)**

Commenter: Nothing to apologize for. This isn’t your fault and you’re the only person in her life who recognizes this for the emergency that it is. Your mom and friends are gaslighting you and only enabling her restrictive eating and delaying her from getting help.

I’m a critical care physician.  
Every once in a while someone like your sister comes to the ICU with life threatening complications from starvation. Everything you just described is very alarming. Can’t say medically if she has caused any significant or permanent damage to her body. She will reach that point If this continues. I think she needs help far beyond what friends, family and even her pediatrician can provide.this is they type of thing that requires everything from social workers, psychiatry, psychotherapy and an experienced pediatrician to really get her what she needs.

Is there is anyone in her life besides your mom who uou can confide in? Could be a coach, a trusted teacher, guidance counselor, religious leader. I know you don’t want to go against your sister, but she isn’t in a state where she can make rational decisions for herself. She needs your help.

>**OOP:** Thank you for this. It was a really long night just waiting. But she got admitted and finally said I could come be with her. I told the doctor everything I knew. She won’t eat anything. I called my dad and he and my mom are fighting about how she got this way. She said she doesn’t want everyone to be mad but she can’t eat

I don’t understand why she’s doing this and I’m starting to feel kind of mad which I know it’s not her fault but it’s so hard to watch

Has she seen psychiatry yet?

Are your parents actually starting to comprehend how serious this is? Or do they need another verbal splash of cold water?

>**OOP:** My dad does. My mom just keeps pleading with her and suggesting giving her salads because it would be easier. The doctor said she’s going to get a tube in her nose if she won’t start eating. I’m not sure if she’s seen psychiatry, she’s seen a few people that I had to leave the room for

**Title:** What does an NG tube feel like? How long does it stay?

Hi. I’m 15 and female, so is my twin sister who this is about. She wasn’t eating and lost a lot of weight. She’s 5’5.5 and about 105 pounds. She lost 30 pounds in 2 months. Now she’s in the hospital because she fainted but it’s been a couple days and she refuses to eat and keeps trying to pinch her IV and the doctor said she’s getting an NG tube. I had questions about everything but I didn’t want to ask them in front of her and scare her or have her doctor think I was being nosy or rude, so I wanted to ask here since last time everyone was helpful.

What does an NG tube feel like?

How long does it stay in?

Will she be able to mess with it?

Why is she just completely refusing everything now? Why doesn’t she just eat?

When I was researching anorexia, which is what the doctor said she has, I saw it’s genetic. Does that mean I could end up like her too?

How long do you stay in the hospital for anorexia? I miss her being home with me.

***Top Comment:***

**DrSocialDeterminants:** It can stay for quite a while. I've seen people leave it for days. That said, she can yank it out at great pain to herself.

I also remember your story as I was one of the docs that posted a response. I'm sorry to see she's still struggling. It's clear from your posts and updates that my concerns were correct and that she's very sick

I would estimate she needs weeks to recover physically from how malnourished she is to get her stable enough to not collapse walking out of the hospital. However, I'm truly concerned that she's a suicide risk to herself as she's shown that even in the hospital, her refusal to eat would be dangerous. I suspect that she will likely be transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility to get more intensive therapy and potentially medications to address her other mental health concerns.

She's in it for the long haul. That said, even after discharge she will likely need years or therapy and support. She will always have a lingering struggle with food and body dysmorphia. She has a great sister to help support her though and that will be helpful in her recovery.

I don't know the evidence for the genetic risks of eating disorders. We know that sometimes family history is important for things like depression and anxiety but thisnisnt my specialty. More importantly, it doesn't mean you're doomed to have this. I would instead focus my efforts on the environment.... thinking of how to have a healthy relationship with food and your body.

I remember your earlier post about her getting upset that you weighed less. She was also getting her mom to support her dieting. You also said you mom constantly says that she's overweight herself and diets despite not needing to. The first thing for your sister is to work through why she's competing with you regarding weight. Honestly though... if your mom constantly says things like she has, then frankly she needs to stop as that's so unhealthy to say that it definitely can contribute to body shaming and displeasure at your body image.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fyknt0/my_sister_is_refusing_to_sleep/) **2: October 5, 2024 (3 days later, 8 days from OG post)**

Hi…This is my third post. I’m really sorry. I’m just so scared and I don’t know who else to ask because hospital doctors won’t tell me much.

My twin sister is 15 and female. She went on this insane diet that turned into anorexia and she lost 30 pounds in two months. Then she fainted and got admitted to the hospital. She wouldn’t eat there either so they put a tube in her. She wouldn’t drink anything but she gets fluids in an IV. So now she’s just refusing to sleep. Because they can’t put that in a tube I guess. But all she does is cry and ask me the same questions over and over like if I’m mad at her and if I love her.

She had a seizure a few days back which was really scary. I don’t understand why she’s doing this and I’m really scared that she’s not sleeping on purpose. What happens if you don’t sleep?? Will you get sick? Can her doctors make her sleep? I don’t understand why she keeps refusing to do basic things. She can’t go to treatment until she’s stable and she says she wants to leave the hospital but it’s like she’s trying to die

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Hi. Dont be sorry about your questions, ask as many as you like!

When someone doesn’t sleep for a while, it can mess with them... like making them feel confused or really sad or make it harder for the body to fight off bad things.

The doctors know what is best for her, and i promise that she is very good hands.  
They might have ways to get her to sleep, even if it means giving her some meds for a bit. They’re watching her closely, trust me - especially since she had a seizure.

I know you’re scared and it’s totally okay and totally normal to feel that way. stay close to your sister, even if she seems distant, that can mean a lot for both of u. and dont forget yourself. if you can, talk to some adult you trust, maybe some of the doctors/nurses?

All the best to both of you.

>**OOP:** I think it is making her feel really sad. She cries almost constantly. She keeps biting her lip to keep herself awake I guess, but it’s swollen and bloody. And when I ask her why she’s doing this and tell her it’s okay to sleep because I’m here too she just says she can’t

Commenter: I just want to chime in here and say that your sister is not doing this to herself, she has a serious illness that results in behavioural changes. Your sister's brain registers food as a threat and she is responding to it in this way. I have seen people with eating disorders force themselves to stay awake because it may burn ever so slightly more calories, or in hospital, are afraid that if they fall asleep, someone may increase feeds/add something to them/push a bolus through, etc.

Some people find it helpful to conceptualise the anorexia as separate to their loved one- or view anorexia as a ""terrorist"" who has taken their loved one hostage. Take care of yourself, and if you have capacity, spend time with your sister so you both remember who she is without the illness.

>**OOP:** I’ve been playing cards with her, and brought our switches, and we are still doing our book club that we’ve done since we were in second grade. I pretty much try not to talk about it unless she brings it up because I don’t want her to feel like I forgot her.

Commenter: You are doing all the right things! Keep on being you, and don’t forget to rest and recuperate yourself - this experience will be just as traumatising for you so be kind to yourself.

**Title:** How much medicine do you give patients in the hospital? Is my sister lying?

My sister is in the hospital for anorexia. She’s 15. She lost a lot of weight and she got a tube in her nose because she wouldn’t eat. It feels like everything has gotten worse since we came here, like being in the hospital made her sicker, and it’s my fault she’s here because I’m the one who called an ambulance on her. But I think I caught her lying about stuff again…

In her bag she has a ton of pills all in one of the pockets. I found them looking for her chapstick. I asked her about it and first she said it was Tylenol but I told her it doesn’t look like it and there’s more than one kind. Then she said they are just her prescription but she dropped the bottle and it broke so she put them in the pocket. But here’s the thing…it’s different kinds. There’s only one kind in a prescription right? So she’s lying? She’s just not taking anything they give her and she’s putting it in her bag? I thought in the hospital they only give you your medicine for the day, not the whole prescription.

I don’t want to tell on her if she’s telling the truth and make her more mad at me and not trust me but it feels like she’s lying. I know some of the medicine is for sleeping and some is for depression. I don’t know about the other one. If she’s not taking it could it hurt her? Is it worth telling them about?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: She might be stashing the ones the hospital gives her. You need to tell her care team about this. Stashing pills is a warning sign.

>**OOP:** A warning sign for what? It feels like she doesn’t want to get better. It’s like she’s sabotaging everything

Commenter: *it feels like she doesn’t want to get better* yes, that’s what mental illness does. She’s in the right place with people who can medically take care of her, you did the right thing bringing her in.

Stashing pills can mean she might be planning to take them all at once to unalive herself. Please tell her care team.

>**OOP:** Fuck. Okay. Thank you. Fuck this sucks.  
*(later to the same commenter):*  
Sorry I shouldn’t have swore that much it’s rude and it wasn’t at you

*How OOP feels:*

It’s so stupid and if I think about it I feel angry so I just don’t so I can’t feel anything. I hate this. I don’t know why she’s doing this when she was fine a few months ago.

*Treatment center:*

She’s not even in a treatment place yet. They won’t take her because she isn’t stable. She’s in a normal hospital

*She needs to be kept under constant observation:*

A nurse was watching her because she kept messing with her tube, but she stopped doing that I think so they weren’t with her all the time the last couple days. But I told the nurse anyway about the medicine and she said she’d take care of it. It feels like the hospital is making her worse

**Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g22key/comment/lrq3c3u/)**: October 13, 2024 (Next Day)**

The doctor came and asked about the pills. She had prescription water pills that weren’t hers, the sleeping medicine they’ve been giving her and thinking she’s been taking, and a stimulant. She won’t say where she got the prescription ones that weren’t hers.

The doctor told her they check all patients bags periodically if they come for mental health so thankfully she doesn’t know it was me that told on her. I asked why she’s doing this and she said she doesn’t know and keeps apologizing.

I keep switching between being mad and being heartbroken. It’s hard to figure out how to feel when it seems like she’s doing it herself. I know she’s not. But there’s nothing tangible like a tumor or bad blood lab to blame and it’s hard to wrap my head around. Sometimes I don’t want to be here with her.

She told me she’s afraid they’re going to make her overweight and I’ll always be the prettier one and I don’t know how to respond to that stuff so I told her I’d like her no matter what and maybe I can eat a bunch of cake so I can be bigger and she can push me around in a scooter. I just miss her. My parents won’t talk about it other than blaming each other. My friends just want all the juicy details.

I’m sorry for rambling so much…it’s just that there isn’t anywhere else anyone actually listens. I know she’s the one that’s sick and not me but it’s really hard.

*Comments:*

Commenter: I wanna give you a hug, you’re a sweetie and you deserve just as much care as you give others

>**OOP**: I would totally take it. I don’t think anyone has hugged me since she got admitted. It’s like I’m invisible now

Commenter: It can help to create some distance by remembering that it's the eating disorder that gets mad and doesn't want to get better. Behind that wall your sister is just sad, scared and sick. \[...\]

>**OOP:** I’ve been trying to think of it like that. Or like she’s possessed. We’re Catholic lmao. But I just want her to be okay.

*Getting therapy:*

>My mom accused me of making it all about myself and my dad asked if I was going to starve myself too and if he should buy a second headstone when I asked about therapy but I found an online ai thingy that’s a little helpful

Commenter: Frankly your mom's been in denial the whole time, which is ironic since she's probably a reason that contributed to your sister since you said your mom is superficial about body image.

Your dad is out of line and what a rude thing to say.

>**OOP:** I think he just can’t handle both of us being needy at the same time. He doesn’t really get why she’s doing this either

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1g5czoo/if_my_twin_sister_has_anorexia_could_i_get_it_too/) **5: October 16, 2024 (3 days later, 3 weeks from OG post)**

I’m a 15 year old female. So is my twin sister, of course. She is really sick with anorexia. It started at the end of the summer and went downhill fast, she lost 30 pounds, and she’s in the hospital with a tube in her nose fighting every attempt to help her. It’s like she’s two people. And i don’t understand at all but she said she doesn’t know why she’s doing it either.

I’ve been researching anorexia to try and understand and see how I can help her and I keep seeing article mentioning how there’s a genetic component. At first I kept thinking “that could never happen to me” but my sister thought the same thing and I don’t think anyone tries to be anorexic… I skipped meals a couple days and then tried fasting for a few to see if I could understand why she’s doing this and I guess i sort of felt proud that I was able to stick with the diet but it didn’t feel so good I would want to slowly kill myself in front of everyone I love over it….is there a chance this could happen to me too? As in am I at a higher risk of also ending up like her because of the genetic part? If so, is there anything I can do to prevent it? Watching her is so scary. It’s not even her anymore. She’s been swallowed up by the anorexia.

As a side note also…is there anything I can do to help her?

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gokcju/can_you_accidentally_make_yourself_anorexic/) **6: November 10, 2024**

**Title:** Can you accidentally make yourself anorexic?

I’m 15, female, 5’3 and 104 pounds.

A bit over a month ago my twin sister got diagnosed with anorexia. She’s in a hospital now and getting better. I was really afraid when she got diagnosed that I would end up like that because I read it was genetic. I didn’t understand at all, I’ve never cared about my body and I still don’t…but I feel like I’ve been fixating on not becoming anorexic so much that I’m actually creating a problem. I went from 113 to 104 in the last month.

I keep getting scared that I’m not eating enough so then I go and eat a lot, like panic eating to try and not under eat and I est so much that I feel sick and embarrassed and gross and at first I was trying to run it off but then I realized I could just throw it up….and I started doing that. I know it’s not good, obviously. And it’s super gross.

But does this mean I’m accidentally making myself anorexic because of how hard I’m trying to avoid it? I don’t care about my weight…I’m not trying to lose weight but I keep losing it anyway. I’m just stuck in this cycle where I feel scared that I’m not eating enough and I suddenly need to set everything but then after I feel so horrible and I want it gone. My mom keeps seeing that I’m eating a ton and telling me I don’t have to eat for me and my sister and that I’m going to get diabetes…I feel like this isn’t good but I don’t know who to ask about this because it’s going to sound so stupid when my sister was literally almost dead from starving herself to ask if I have an issue.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Hey OP! I remember you and your posts. I’m so sorry you are struggling. There are a lot of ways that we can have a difficult relationship with food, and you have been through an ENORMOUS amount of stress in the last few months. What you are doing, as you guessed, is not healthy and can become an eating disorder on its own if you don’t get help. But the earlier you get help, the better the outcome. Can you ask your mom to get your own therapist ? If she’s not open to it, could you talk to a social worker at school or maybe at the hospital where your sister is?

>**OOP:** Hi. I remember you too. I feel kind of stupid asking to see a therapist because I don’t want anyone to think I’m copying her or that I want attention :/ I’m really not, but it’s like it I can’t stop thinking about it and I forgot how I used to eat without thinking. But the place my sister is at had a sibling support group that I go to, maybe the therapist who leads it could help?

Commenter: I just saw the sentence about the sibling support group, sorry! Yes, absolutely! Go talk to the therapist! I’m sure that you will not be the first sibling needing more help. I really think this is the best thing you can do.

>**OOP:** I’m going to ask tonight if she can recommend anyone I could see and if she’d help me tell my parents

*How sis is doing:*

Thank you. My sister is doing a lot better. She’s a lot less angry, and she talks about different stuff now. I feel like I completely forgot how I used to eat without thinking before and I forget to eat and then panic that I’m not eating enough and then overeat and then want it gone. I haven’t been feeling hungry at all. I’m hoping you’re right that when it’s further away it’ll be easier. I’m afraid I’m going to make things worse for my sister too if I start doing this.

Or so I kept telling myself...

David and I moved here two years ago, retreating from the chaos of city life to the quiet solitude of a cabin in the woods. The lake stretched like a dark mirror to the edges of our property, bordered by towering pines and the rustling silence of the forest. We were one of eight cabins dotted around the lake, each separated by enough land to make you feel utterly alone.

David took to the lifestyle instantly. He spent mornings down at the dock fishing, his silhouette blending with the mist that hovered over the water.

I preferred the cabin, where sunlight poured through the kitchen windows as I sipped coffee and read all the books on my once ever-growing list.

There was a permanence here, a sense of stillness I hadn’t felt in years. I loved the way the seasons transformed the lake... the fiery leaves of autumn reflected like a painting on the water, the brittle stillness of winter mornings when the lake turned to ice.

Our neighbors were essentially ghosts.

Most of the cabins belonged to city people like us, but they came only for the occasional weekend. For long stretches, it was just David, me, and the occasional visit from Naya.

Naya was a cleaner that came recommended to us by the cabin's previous owners.

She came once a month, her long dark hair streaked with gray, her sharp eyes taking in everything. She was Ojibwe and rarely spoke in English, moving through the cabin like she belonged to a different world. Her movements were deliberate, almost ritualistic.

One day while finishing up, she unexpectedly made us tea. A strong chamomile that she very enthusiastically served to David and me.

“A holiday tea to celebrate my heritage,” she said with a big smile.

David thought it was a quaint bit of local culture, but it unsettled me. There was a gravity to Naya’s presence, something unspoken that clung to her like smoke. I didn’t ask questions. I just drank the tea, the bitter warmth spreading through me like a balm.

That night was awful.

I remember the date, November 23rd, because it happened to be my birthday.

Instead of celebrating, David and I spent the night drenched in sweat, feverish and disoriented. The nausea came in waves, and my head throbbed with a pressure that felt like it might split me in two. David joked the next morning that it must have been something we ate, or maybe the sudden cold snap. I wanted to believe him. But something about it didn’t feel right.

By the second November, I started to notice the pattern.

It began with the cleaning. Naya showed up unannounced on Friday, the 24th, even though we told her we didn't need any help in November. She moved through the cabin with a kind of frenetic energy, scrubbing every surface, burning herbs until the air was thick with their earthy sharpness.

And then she served us the same tea.

I remembered the smell... chamomile... mixed with something else... something chemically.

“A holiday tea to celebrate my heritage!” she said again, her smile tight, her eyes holding mine for a beat too long.

There was something majorly off, something about the way her fingers lingered on the rim of the cup as she handed it to me. David took his with a grin, swallowing it in one gulp. Not wanting to seem ungrateful, I took a sip of mine.

The sickness hit that night. Hard.

I woke in the dark, my limbs heavy, my head spinning.

Beside me, David was passed out, his breathing deep and even, but I couldn’t move. It was as if my body had been pinned to the bed, trapped under an invisible weight. Panic surged through me, my heart pounding as I struggled to cry out, but no sound came.

Then I heard it.

A low, mournful wail echoed across the lake, a sound so alien it made my skin crawl. It wasn’t the cry of an animal or the wind through the trees. It was something alive, something ancient. The sound grew louder, vibrating through the walls of the cabin, seeping into my bones. I wanted to look, to see what was out there, but my body refused to obey. My eyes, fixed on the window, caught the faintest shadow... a tall, gaunt figure standing just beyond the glass.

Its face was wrong. Hollow. Its eyes were voids, blacker than the night. I felt it staring at me, its gaze piercing through my skull. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. All I could feel was the pull. An invisible force urging me to step outside, to leave the safety of the cabin.

The wail crescendoed, a terrible, keening sound that rattled my teeth.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it vanished.

The next morning, I was convinced something was deeply wrong. I began asking questions around the lake, but no one wanted to talk about Naya.

The other cabins stayed dark through most of the month, their occupants vanishing like clockwork. When I mentioned the tea, the sickness, their faces paled.

One woman, her voice barely above a whisper, said, “Just drink it. Don’t ask why.”

It was Naya herself who finally gave me the truth, though she did so reluctantly. I think the neighbors had mentioned to her that I was asking around.

“The tea keeps you safe from the taking,” she said one afternoon, her eyes fixed on the lake. “It is a family recipe to bind you to your body. Keeps the spirit from taking you.”

“What spirit?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

Her gaze shifted to me, hard and unyielding.

“The old spirit of the lake,” she said. “It wakes on the third weekend of November. It comes to those who are strong, those who are vibrant. It needs to consume them to sustain itself.”

“And the tea?” I pressed.

She hesitated. “It makes you weak. Undesirable.”

The words hung between us, heavy and awful. I thought of the sickness, the way it left me hollowed out, and I realized what she meant.

She was poisoning us... on purpose.

“The spirit looks for the healthiest among us, those with strong bodies and strong spirits. It needs a sacrifice, and it takes the ones who seem most vibrant. By poisoning you, I make you look weak, unworthy of its attention. I know the sickness is painful, and I am truly sorry for that, but it is the only way to keep you safe. To make you seem undesirable to the spirit.”

""You do this for -""

""Every resident here. My family has not lost a human to the taking in 26 years. The spirit feeds on animals through the night. Though my mother worries it is growing impatient for a strong human sacrifice.""

I looked at her, the weight of her words sinking in. The way the other cabins always seemed dark throughout November, the way the lake seemed to hold its breath. It all made sense now, the unspoken understanding that everyone here shared, the reason no one was ever outside that night.

“Thank you,” I said finally, my voice trembling. “For keeping us safe.”

Naya nodded, her expression softening, but there was something in her eyes—something haunted.

The third weekend of November is in just a couple days.

This morning, I looked out at the water, its surface calm and still, knowing we have the right person looking out for us. But I can’t shake the feeling of dread that clings to me like a second skin.

I know what’s coming. I know the sickness will hit, and I will spend the night writhing in pain, fighting the urge to step outside.

I will drink the tea. I will let Naya do what she must, her bundles of sage and sweetgrass filling the air with their sharp, earthy scent. I am grateful for her protection, for the knowledge that she and her family have kept the spirit at bay for nearly three decades.

And I will pray that, this year, the spirit finds David and I as undesirable as before.",5,1732253884.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I still think of that night you came downstairs and told me the future I planned was changing. Can I tell you now what I thought my future would look like? What I envisioned would be, or what could have been?

My future was you. My future was them. My future was us, together, raising them to be better than what we could ever hope to be. My future was waking up to you every morning. I’d give you sweet kisses or just admire you while you slept. My future was making you coffee, getting the kids ready for school, and getting ready for work. My future was after school events, picking the kids up from practice, coming home to you, hugging you, kissing you and asking about your day. My future was helping them with their homework, making them shower and brush their teeth and do their chores, even when they didn’t want to. My future was learning how to be a better partner for you, and helping you be a better partner for me. My future was us finally building a deck on the front of the house so we could sit in the rocking chairs, holding hands while the kids played in the yard. My future was looking into your eyes and knowing deep down that I could never love anyone more than I loved you, and that I could never feel loved by anyone more than you. My future was perfect, not because there were never problems but because we faced them together as a family. With love and trust and compassion we could have faced any obstacles life threw at us. What a life that could have been. 

Waking up in this empty bed, I sit with an emptiness that words fail to describe. 

What if I had seen the signs? What if I had somehow loved you more? What if I had spent more time cherishing you? What if I could have seen you slipping away? Could I have changed the outcome? Could I have somehow convinced you to stay? Could I have rekindled the spark, the connection that once brought us so close? Could I have held onto that bright future, where you and I raised our children together, being that annoying older couple that can’t keep their hands off each other? Could we have loved each other until the end of our days? That’s the future I thought we’d have, but now I can only wonder what could have been?

I write this to finally tell you, I still see the story. The movie still plays, the crowd cheers as the tears stream down my cheeks. But as days and weeks go by, I realize this story will never be told. The credits have already rolled, there are no pages left in the book, the curtain is closed. No sequels, no more chapters, no encore. The beautiful story, our story, I wrote in my heart was never meant to be. It’s time to let go of what could have been.

Normally my bms look like golf balls. I drink a lot of water, also drink some electrolytes most days, not all. 
Started taking probiotics but they didn't help and also make me bloat. How long do they take to have an effect? I eat lots of fruits and veggies for the fiber, and whole grains. Example for my diet will be what I ate today: fasted for breakfast, water, water w electrolytes, protein chips before gym, went to the gym, more water, ate a Chipotle bowl (light brown rice, light black beans, chicken, veggies, corn salsa, no cheese, no sour cream, guacamole and hot salsa) water, then dinner was a Greek yogurt parfait (Greek yogurt, organic blueberries, kiwi w skin on, local honey, chia seeds, flax seed granola) and whole grain toast w Almond butter. I've been focusing more on fiber intake from foods, and eating less processed, more natural foods. Dinner is typically some type of meat with sautéed veggies, and maybe roasted potatoes or salad. I stopped taking metamucil because I feel like it made my constipation worse. I stopped taking miralax because I wanted to reset my gut and start from scratch with a healthier diet and more yogurt, oatmeal, chia seeds, and probiotics. Prune juice makes me gassy and does little movement for me anymore. Coffee doesn't help, and I'm trying to cut it out since its not benefitting me anyways. My questions are: I'm thinking of starting some supplements and don't know what will be beneficial or what else I can try at this point. I'm leery of taking any oils since they're hard on your kidney/liver. Does magnesium citrate in capsule form benefit constipation? How long will it take to work? I don't want a quick fix, I want something to produce consistent, smooth stools. Probiotic: should I keep taking them? It's been 2 weeks and the bloating made me stop.

I have been addicted to caffeine since the age of 15 when I started drinking energy drinks. For a solid 9 years I have had one 200+ mg energy drink per day. The habit has followed me through numerous jobs and into a demanding job where I’m interacting with people all day.

So now I’m at the point that one energy drink doesn’t feel like enough. I have tried replacing with coffee but I just drink lots of coffee since I can make it myself. It’s gotten to the point where I know the caffeine is wreaking havoc on my body. My digestive system is completely messed up, I have severe mood swings and spikes in anxiety, and literally rush for my morning energy drink like a feral animal. It’s bad! 

If I get to 11am with no caffeine I get a searing headache that lasts for hours even if I drink caffeine. I want to quit or at least severely moderate to only drinking green tea or something, but I have no idea how to do it. I can’t do my job if I have a blinding headache so I don’t know where to start. I thought about switching to a 100mg energy drink for a month and then gradually weaning down. Any advice is appreciated. ",5,1732253149.0,getdisciplined,5,1.0,False

I'm not usually one to cling to the past, so I'm unsure if I'm being nostalgic or genuinely interested.

  
If I go through with meeting her, how should I approach it? Should I try to plan an activity that makes conversation easier, or is grabbing coffee enough?

The worst one is that I'm barely getting enough sleep now. I usually sleep 6 hours a night, that's always been my average. Depending on how active I was during the day or how much coffee I drank, that can go up to 7-8 or down to 5, but 5 is the absolute minimum I've always generally had. I track my sleeping duration with my smart ring, and on day 5 and today on day 6, I had really bad sleep, on both days, I had 4 and 3 hours of sleep consecutively I have to compensate for with a nap during the day. And this has only started happening after quitting sugar. 

Sure, positive effects include less bloating, a truer feeling of hunger (when I wake up, I feel like I'm starving, when I eat, I feel *truly* satiated, no more cravings out of nowhere, no more overeating, I'd just eat my food, feel great and get on with it), energy stayed optimal, I don't feel overly energetic or the opposite, and my sleep has taken a turn for the worse...My sleeping routine stayed the same. I usually drink 2 magnesium pills and try not eat or drink anything 2-3 hours prior and read a book which would put me to sleep, but the sleeping quality decreased. My smart ring's app is going haywire throwing all kinds of warnings and signals that my heart-rate is dropping late, my HRV is getting low, and I'm not getting enough sleep and I should prioritize sleep.

1gx0c7v,https://i.redd.it/1k12f9jdzd2e1.jpeg,Success Story,"Ok so I wanted to come on here and share things that have really improved my hair regrowth journey. For context, I started shedding like crazy about 2 months after I got COVID and genuinely thought all hope was lost. I’ve been taking my regrowth journey seriously for the better part of a year now and have had major success (still a work in progress tho!)

Lifestyle:
1. Exercising regularly (even if it’s just taking talks)
2. Cutting out stressful people and removing myself from anxiety-inducing situations 
3. Forgoing anything to drink but water and tea for the most part (saving any alc for special occasions)
4. Getting good sleep, trying to be in bed before midnight as often as possible

Diet
1. Drinking at least 3800Ml of water (approx 1 gallon) each day is always a goal of mine now
2. Trying to eat a balanced diet, avoiding ultra-processed foods, focussing on fruits and veggies
3. Essentially cutting out meat - I know this one is iffy for some people, but I noticed my stomach felt better and my body felt better when I stopped eating meat. I am iron deficient and occasionally will have beef bc iron tablets make me nauseous when I’m having a deficiency episode (like around my period). But looking at the meat industry and the chemicals that are used in the processing was the catalyst but the unintended boost in energy and feeling less sluggish has kept me away.
4. Focussing on getting protein from non-meat sources. Even if you do eat meat, getting protein from plants is a 2-for-1 bc you’re also getting nutrients specific to plants not found in meat
5. Limiting dairy - this was more for skin health, I noticed my scalp stopped producing as much oil when I limited milk to creamer in the mornings and a dessert 1-2x a week. Plus my acne is more at bay now

Supplements: Ranking Them
lol I feel like it looks like a lot but I’ve had a history of anaemia and low iron for pretty much all of my life. Iron doesnt count in the ranking bc it’s specific to my health needs but I will say that it didn’t cure my hair loss so I give a lot more credit to the other supplements 
1. Nutrafol + Pumpkin Seed Oil - this is so hit or miss so I would honestly invest in the Saw Palmetto ingredient and take with PSO. But with both of these, my hair shedding decreased so much and I saw so much regrowth when I added PSO after 3 months of Nutrafol. But Nutrafol alone did give me a ton of regrowth and my shedding is under control.
2. Collagen + Folic Acid: I saw so many improvements first in my eyelashes and eyebrows, but I’ve noticed that my hair has a shine now that it didn’t have before and the strength is amazing. My FA levels have always been lower, but not below the healthy amount, so it’s not necessary that I take them but the improvements have been great especially with new hairs. Collagen just made my skin and nails better as well so yay
Zinc and Omega : these are my most recent add-ins but the overall clarity I’ve gotten in my skin and the way my scalp feels has changed since taking these for the better. Idk if this’ll make sense, but I feel like TE showed in my overall appearance not just my hair. I noticed that having healthier, fuller hair has been correlated with having better skin. Plus these apparently can help with hair loss.
Extras:
1. Almond oil - more more maintaining hair and keeping the scalp moisturised especially (2-3x a week for 30min before shampooing) during dryer seasons 
2.  Scalp massages - daily, 5-10min
3. Coffee + Green Tea mixture on scalp (not pictured) - before I started doing anything else other than massaging, I would put coffee on my scalp and I do think that helped slow down my shedding. The science isn’t conclusive is either of these actually help with hair loss, but they’re good for the scalp’s health. (Same frequency as almond oil)
4. Dermarolling - fairly recent but I think I notice some hairs on stubborn places starting to grow back in

Other notes:
1. Invest in fragrance free shampoos and conditions or ones that are naturally scented.
2. Be patient - I def didn’t see tangible results for about 6months

Hope this helps!!

1gx09h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gx09h1/dating_a_fifo_worker/,Dating a FIFO Worker ,"In early August I went for a night out with one of my girlfriends, and we got talking to a group of guys in line for a nightclub; I took a particular interest in one of them, and we spent the rest of the night chatting and dancing together. I got really good vibes from him and was enjoying our conversations, so although very out of character for me, I ended up inviting him back to my place as the night was drawing to a close. He spent the night, we got coffee together the next morning, and he went on his way - but not before making sure he had my number right in his phone.

We actually started chatting online that same day, and a few days after that he made plans for a date, which pleased me because I was hoping he would want to see me again - I thought he was a really interesting, attractive person, and wanted to spend more time with him. We've been seeing each other consistently since then, and texting pretty much daily, and I'm definitely starting to develop feelings for him - but there's a problem: he works FIFO as a mining engineer, so he's away for 8 days of a fortnight, and only home for 6.

Obviously he has friends, family, hobbies, and other commitments he dedicates time and attention to during the 6 days he has at home, and a lot of the time I'm working on the days/nights he has free, so we're usually only seeing each other once, sometimes twice, a fortnight - if we're lucky. My brain is struggling with this - I really like him, and I wish we could see each other more often, but unfortunately we just can't. This obviously also makes it much harder to get close with each other, let alone pursue a romantic relationship - but I don't even know if that's what I want...

Does anyone have any experience with dating when one person works FIFO, from either end? Should I just enjoy the time we have together and accept it for what it is? Should I be seeing other people in addition to him? Or would it be better to just call things off if I'm feeling frustrated? ",2,1732252009.0,dating,2,1.0,False

I couldn’t sleep. And I could barely eat. I was so upset I even threw up food and had to clean it . I didn’t let anyone know I threw up but I cleaned it with toilet paper . I had a corner jail stall . My 2nd day a girl from the stall right on the other 90 degree corner cell threw “coffee grounds” I don’t think that’s what it was …. I was laying in bed heard something hit the floor thrown in. I picked it up and flushed it immediately I didn’t know what it was and I didn’t want to get into trouble for whatever it was . The toilets would only flush every 20 or more minutes . Luckily it flushed . I asked the girl what tf was that she said it was coffee grounds she got mad I threw it out but she left that day later on (got out) . The 2nd night I was glad I didn’t have her next to me .

I remember thinking to myself that this is / was the lowest point in my life and I made a pact with myself to never go to jail again as it was the worst yet eye opening experience of my life .

The 3rd day when I had my court case on a tv screen for zoom a guard was confiding in me told me what to say and to calm down and that I would be okay and it would be dropped . I think about him all the time . He was so kind to me when I was shown nothing but that in there . The 3 days I was calling my family over and over . I had to go downstairs in front of all the cells and with a guard to make calls . The third day I went down there with a woman. She yelled at me for not wearing a mask I went to go get it and got yelled at again. My family isn’t good with calls I called my mom and sister both twice each . Before my last call I made she said I’m not just going to sit here and make all these calls for you …. Something like that but mean and nasty. She ask if I understood or some shit (saying it nasty I honestly don’t remember what she said ) and I told her “I heard you “ and looked at her I made my last call (4th) to my sis and her and my mom spoke to me at 8 AM while getting ready for work I told them about the court . Got out later that day and I walked to a local business where my sister picked me up. I didn’t shower for days and looked exactly how I felt .

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/uooiesZxcS): **November 13, 2024**

Throwaway account . I appreciate if you give me your honest opinion as I’m being pressured from everyone (except my aunt) to go against my wish .

I’m a 30 year old woman. I have been with my fiancé Sarah for the last 5 years. We are the same age and we met at grad school. When I was 13 my loving dad passed away. He left a decent amount of money for us . My mom within 6 months got engaged to a guy named Bob. Bob had a daughter around my age . 

My mom married Bob within a year of my dad’s passing . Bob really hated me from the start and didn’t even try to hide it. He was saying stuff like how my mom should have sent me to a boarding school , how if it wasn’t because of my dad’s inheritance he wouldn’t have me in his house , or I’m a “bulldyke” because I was in our school sport team and very athletic . He multiple times told my mom he doesn’t feel safe when his daughter is around me . I wasn’t even yet ! Used this as a reason to exclude me pretty much from everything . 

My mom on the other hand was going above and beyond to prove to Bob that she is the new mom for Bob’s little princess . They ended up having 3 more kids. Basically I was a roommate who did babysitting for my mom and her New family . I never had a birthday party or a special day . 

My dad’s sister was amazing to me . I was at their place all the time . She and her family had birthday celebrations for me and my mom was making excuses not show up and of course rest of them never showed up ( I was really my aunt and uncle’s daughter! They were amazing to me ). When I left for university I contacted my mom a few times but she was always busy so I just gave up. 

Here is the issue , Sarah , my fiancé come from a very family oriented background. Family is everything to her. Her family asked about mine I said my dad passed away and my mom is busy with her family and lives across the country . I didn’t entirely lie technically. Sarah asked me to invite my family to our wedding . I told her no. She said it’s very embarrassing not having only my aunt and her family on my side . I reluctantly invited my mom. She called and asked me to apologize to Bob and my step and half siblings for not inviting them and invite them all. I told her no ! She said I’m being ungrateful and Bob was a father figure to me. I had a big argument with my mom over this . 

My mom now says the only way she comes is if I invite Bob , his daughter and their kids. Sarah is now pushing me to invite them all because she doesn’t wanna feel embarrassed in front of her family . These people never even gave me card or said happy birthday to me so I see no reason to celebrate my big day with them. I on the other hand don’t wanna let my fiancé down. I just don’t know what to do ? Should I swallow my ego and invite my family so my fiancé be happy ? I suggested eloping but Sarah is a firm no. AITAH to ruining my fiancé’s day by not fulfilling her wish ?

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/JQof2G2zSa

Edit : Sarah knows everything about my life. My aunt even talked to her about how they treated me when I was growing up.

Edit 2: I will have a serious talk with Sarah tonight . I’ll try to update soon

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received the majority of NTAs**

**Relevant Comments**

**Did OOP want to have a wedding with Sarah?**

> **OOP:** Tbh my dream wedding would be elopement. Sarah has this dream wedding in her mind , and I don’t want to ruin it for her. She wants a big beautiful wedding with families surrounding us. I feel ashamed my family is so messed up and embarrassing her. I feel so inadequate like I’m letting her down. The whole wedding planning has been so stressful and i understand it affected her mental health. No ! Before getting engaged we had a very nice relaxing lifestyle .to be fair before getting engaged she never cared if my mom is in the picture or how her family feel if they see how messed up my family is

**Commenter 1:** Are you sure Sarah is the person for you? She seems pretty dismissive of your boundaries and feelings

> **OOP:** She was 100% before we got engaged… the whole idea of dream wedding completely changed her

**OOP should postpose the wedding and get in therapy**

> **OOP:** My aunt one time said that then changed the topic when she saw me upset. She said you are trying not to disappoint her and win her love because she is literally like your mom! You wanna win her love this time. She apologized later. We both moved on from that topic..

**Did OOP get proper therapy to deal with the abandonment and abuse from her mother?**

> **OOP:** No I haven’t. I buried my head in to my books when I moved out. I was working and finishing my degree. I started grad school right away and that’s where I met Sarah . I wasn’t a virgin lol I never had a real long term relationship before Sarah . It was always casual because I was terrified of being abandoned so I would always make sure they knew it’s casual . When I met Sarah , I told her the same but she said she wasn’t going anywhere because she liked me a lot. Our casual hook ups turned in to dating and love

**Commenter 2:** NTA - but I want to ask.... Is Sarah the person you want to spend your life with if she can't understand that you are NC with your abusers?

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/pbNDMDfcxP): **November 14, 2024 (next day)**

Thank you for your comments and DMs. They really gave me perspective on my life. I sat Sarah down last night and explained my reasoning for not inviting my family. She kept saying, “That was a long time ago; they might not be the same people anymore.” I felt offended and said, “How on earth are you lecturing me when you’ve never even met them?”

Well, it turned out my mother has been in touch with Sarah. Sarah said they regularly meet for coffee dates and talk. I was about to cry because I was so angry. My mom changed the whole narrative, saying Bob was a father figure, a good, protective dad, and that it was me who didn’t love him back because, apparently, it’s my thing to play the victim. She claimed my aunt manipulated me and stole me from their family, trying to be a replacement for my mom. According to her, it’s all about my mother.

I screamed, “ARE YOU FOR REAL? Ask her next time on your coffee dates why I never had a birthday party growing up! Why was there never a gift under the tree for me? Ask Bob if he even knows when my birthday is, since he was such a loving dad! Why did my aunt have to pick me up before Christmas Eve because Bob wanted to spend the holiday with his kids, not with another man’s mistake?”

Sarah basically repeated what my mom has told me my whole life: “You just love to make a big deal out of everything, make yourself a victim, and push everyone away.” I told her she had no right contacting my mom. She said I was cruel and claimed she was just trying to help me mend my broken relationship. She even called my mom lovely and said Bob has changed a lot; he’s now an LGBTQ ally now that his princess is out ! I was floored. An ally? Maybe he should start by apologizing to me for terrorizing my entire childhood.

I told Sarah we are done. I can’t do this. Sarah sarcastically said, “You just proved your mom’s point! Go run to your aunt! Let that old witch run your life.” I told her she needs to find a new place ASAP, considering she’s not paying rent—I am. She got mad and asked what excuse I was going to make up this time to justify my “bullshit trauma.” I stopped replying. She went on a tirade, breaking our dinner plates. I didn’t care. I texted my aunt, and she asked if I wanted to spend the night at her place. I said I was fine.

I’m taking time off from work. I cleaned up the kitchen (which was full of broken dishware) in the morning because I didn’t want my cats to accidentally get hurt. Sarah is still sleeping. I’m going to see how I can legally evict her. I’m a complete mess, but I’ll talk to my aunt and uncle for help.

Yes, I am not starting to date again until I see a therapist and work on myself. I can’t keep going through this.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Just curious OP, if your family lives across the country how was Sarah having regular coffee dates with your mom?

> **OOP:** I explained later. That was the lie Sarah told her parents and I didn’t correct it. Yes I shouldn’t have lied to them. I should have taken the hint when she asked me to lie. We live in lower mainland , Vancouver and my mom lives in Abbotsford to be exact if you wanna check how far she lives away from us

**Commenter 2:** Where did you think your SO was when she was gone for 2+ hours on a coffee date with your mom? How did she do this weekly without you knowing?

> **OOP:** Sarah is between jobs that’s why I stopped charging her rent. I go to the office everyday . Probably during the day ? I’ll come back soon to answer to more questions . I’m very busy now

**Commenter 3:** Sorry you have to go through this. Still, it's better you have discovered what kind of person Sarah is before getting married. You owe this to your mom, at least something good came out from her direction 🤔.

I know a dating app isn’t exactly Cupid’s ideal setup, but hey, I’m open to taking the chance! Who knows, maybe it’ll lead me to you, the “favorite person” who’ll add that extra sparkle to my days. If it’s you, I’ll happily make you the reason behind my smiles, the name on my notifications that makes me look twice, and the thought that sneaks into my daydreams.

I’m not looking for a fairy tale, just someone who’ll be the sunshine in my life—someone to share laughter, silence, small talks, and deep talks. Someone who’ll make even the most ordinary days feel like they mean something. Let’s be each other’s “everyday” from simple study dates  to late-night movies, and quiet moments we’ll remember just because we’re together.

A little about me:
- 5’0 college student who juggles books, chemicals, and a whole lot of caffeine (and somehow still finds time to date)
- I can be your partner in crime, your personal cheerleader, and the one to listen when life feels heavy
- Also, I have a sport, so introduce me to something you’re interested in too—let’s make it a way of sharing our little worlds with each other.

Dreaming of someone who:
- Doesn’t just say “hi” but knows how to keep a conversation going and has a curious mind (bonus points if you’re as random as I am!)
- Bonus if you’re from the yellow school (matic paskuhan date chz)
- Ideally from NCR so we can meet for coffee and long walks; in short, I’m not down for LDRs
- Has a warm heart, patient, and accepting of my quirks, late-night study sessions, and school stress
- I’d prefer someone taller, but honestly, the vibe matters.

If you’re someone who’s looking to build something real, someone who’s up for the small moments and big dreams, let’s make this connection one that we both look forward to every day.

Now, I know this sounds harsh, but please hear me out. I, 21 (F) have a big issue. And before you ask, yes, I've seeked professional help. 

The issue is, my grandma 70 (F) is taking care of my great-grandma (101, F), let's call her Margarita. And things are not okay at all.

For context: 

My grandma comes from a very traditional Mexican family. They grew up in a pueblo and as years went on, they began to live in different places.

Now, eer since I can remember the family has always done the same thing over and over. My great-grandma would spend half of the year with my aunt (80 F) in a small pueblo, and the other half of the year with my grandma. I would like to add that Margarita has 5 kids (3 women and 2 men) but due to the way they grew up in, only my grandma and one my aunties take care of her (This is important as we go further).

The issue here is that as the years have gone by, my grandma gets more and more frustrated with Margarita. Everything is a small trigger to make her explode in anger. If Margarita eats, my grandma gets mad, if Margarita doesn't eat, my grandma gets mad, if Margarita is sleeping, my grandma gets mad, and if she doesn't, my grandma also gets mad, to the point where I can apply this theory with everything... and I mean EVERYTHING.

 I have two aunties, but they both live in different states, so the only ones that visit my grandma regularly are me and my mom. It would always be the same routine. I would go to school, mom would go to work and then we would go to my grandma's house all day until almost 10 pm, then go back home.

I didn't mind that routine at first, but in the last maybe 3 years things have been going downhill. The situation in the house has become unbearable for me. We can't have a normal conversation without my grandma yelling at Margarita at the top of her lungs for every single thing she does. And it's not because Margarita can't hear properly, nonono, it's because she wants to treat her like she can't understand. She would slap her hand, she would yell at her, take away her food and even her drinks just to prove a nonexistent point. That point being ""Margarita is just lazy, she doesn't want to do anything"" or ""I have to do everything because she can't do it"" or simply ""She doesn't know what she wants, I'm doing the best for her"".

Mind you, Margarita is the healthiest person in my family. She walks on her own (She has a cane), she eats on her own, she changes her clothes, she washes her teeth, she can see, she can hear (if you speak close to her ear),etc. So she doesn't need someone to be stuck to her 24/7. 

Another thing to add here is that due to her age, Margarita is cold all day long. She's been wearing winter clothes since July because she feels cold. My city is a very cold place in the winter, so she's having more issues now with the weather. (This is also important for later) and she also forgets things very easily when it comes to short term, but she remembers a lot of things from when she was younger (She can recite things almost perfectly that she learned in elementary school)

But my grandma hates it. She always gets mad when Margarita forgets simple things like, did she drink water? What day is today? Did she already eat? Did she go to the bathroom? Did she already took her nap? and stuff like that. Or when Margarita says that she wants to drink some cold water or beer, but at the same time she also wants warm coffee or hot chocolate. (And honestly, I get it. I wouldn't want to drink water that's not cold, ew)

My family and I have all tried to tell her to seek help from a nurse, but she refuses completely, her excuse is that ""I'm going to have to run around the nurse 24/7"" which is really not the case. We've offered to pay for a nurse ourselves (Our family is really big, so we offered to all put money), but she still doesn't want help. We've offered her physiological help, but she refuses. Now, I understand that she is from a different generation, a more traditional one, but she also knows that she's sick. She's aware that her mental health is declining rapidly, but she avoids talking about it every time. We've offered to pay for activities so she can go out and spend time for herself doing what she likes, but she refuses. And this also applies to my aunt who takes care of Margarita the other half of the year. They are both closed up the the idea of getting help. No one is able to get it thru their heads that both of them are burnt out. They are abusing an elderly person every single day of their life's, but they simply don't see it that way.

This is also very frustrating because, like I mentioned before, Margarita has 5 kids. The problem is that my uncles don't want to take care of Margarita because ""it's the daughters who have to do it"". And only one of my uncles sends money to help my grandma pay for Margarita's expenses. But listen, my grandma has enough money, so that is not a struggle she faces. What she need is HELP like actual HELP.

And this whole ordeal just gets worst when you put my grandmother and my aunt together. The abuse doubles. And even if we try to help, they get mad. They vent in the worst way possible, blaming Margarita for everything, even if she has an accident, they blame her for ""not being fast enough"" or ""for drinking too much water"". If she's cold they would blame her because ""how can she be cold if she has a lot of clothes on?"" Or when she doesn't want to eat a lot they yell because ""how can she not eat, she's just waisting good food"". Well, maybe it's because SHE'S FREAKING 101, but nope, to them, she's just being irrational... or lazy....

My mom and I always try to make things easy. We help as much as we can in the house, we run errands or we take care of Margarita so my grandma can go out with her friends. We really take it easy with Margarita and we try to be as patient as we can because we know that she is slowly getting older. We buy her the snacks she wants, or her random cravings even if she doesn't eat them. We are basically mediators in all of this.  We stay there almost all day, 5 days a week. I've lost sleep because instead of being able to finish my school projects, I'm helping with taking care of Margarita. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind helping around because I see it as something I do out of love, but it does take time away from my school work or even my extra activities, and this also applies to my mom.

Now, to the real deal. This whole situation has taken a tow in our family and the way we interact. My mom and I know for a fact that we can't live with my grandma because we have our own lifes, but the tension has been brutal, and that has even affected my health. I constantly have headaches, I have insomnia due to the stress of knowing that I'll have to go to my grandma's house the next day,  I get anxiety when I don't go because I'm scared of what can happen to them or what my grandma could do to Margarita, I get constant stomach aches so I end up not eating at all, etc...

And I know it might sound horrible, but I've thought so many times that maybe, just maybe, if Margarita simply passed away, everything would be fine. It sound bad, I know, and it's not something I like to think, but no one cares about her, and I don't mean it in a derrogatory way, but no one stops to ask her how's she's feeling? What's on her mind? How is she that day? Nothing. She wakes up, and she gets yelled at, she get belittled, she get abused. Me and my mom have talked to her a few times, and it's a bit hard to get an answer from her, but we know that she's afraid of being alone, she's scared that she will be alone if she ever passes away, but my grandma and her sibling don't care.  It's hard because, there's been times when I've heard  Margarita wake up asking if someone's there because they leave her alone. They leave a 101 year old woman alone without any help. It hurts me to see the way they treat her, and it's not because they can't. It's because they don't want to. Because they as SIBLINGS don't want to talk about their own MOTHER. They just toss her from one side to the other, waiting to see who gets the hot potato. 

But I would also like to add, that I'm no saint. Due to my own stress, I've also said some harsh things to my grandma for the way she treats Margarita, and I know I'm wrong, but I also admit that I'm scared. I'm scared that something will happen to my grandma and that we won't be there to do anything for her. This gives me mayor anxiety due to what I experienced in a past mayor (criminology) so I've told my grandma multiple times that it's dangerous for her to live like this, but she doesn't do anything about it. 

At this point, I just hope that one day, Margarita doesn't wake up, I just hope that she passes away peacefully in her sleep. And that she only remembers the positive things we said about her when me and my mom were around, and that she knows that there were people who really did care for her. 

We recently made a plan in case Margarita does pass away in my city so we can transport her to her hometown. My grandma doesn't seem to care, she's very nonchalant about it, but my aunt is angry, she hates that we even dare to talk about her mother passing away. So this makes things harder

I'm aware that maybe if Margarita passes away things will get worst, because well, Mexican family. But honestly, I wouldn't feel bad for my grandmother or her siblings. I know my grandma and aunt sacrificed their time for Margarita, but...they never accepted the help, and they never tried to speak with their siblings to find a solution. It's sad to say, but I know that when the day comes, I won't feel sympathy for any of them.

Who I'm most worried about is my mom. She is the closest person to Margarita because she grew up with her (Long story short, due to some issues my grandma left my mom with Margarita when she was younger for a few years) so my mom sees Margarita as her own mother. She has told me before that if Margarita passes away that she is going to be devastated, and I completely understand that. She said that's she's aware of the fact that it can happen any day, but I know she's also scared that it happens.

I know it might seem like I don't care about Margarita, but it's the other way around. I deeply care for her. I love to hear her stories, her jokes, her songs. Damn, I even find it hilarious when she randomly argues with me for no reason. I know I'll miss her if she dies, but I also know that I don't want to see her go thru this abuse any longer... it's not fair that your own family puts you through so much because they can't take care of their own issues.

4 years ago, in June, my dad had a coworker of his who our entire family was very good friends with die from cancer which crushed us all.
3 years ago, in October,  I lost my grandma and saw her take her very last breath as she faded away from existence again from cancer.
2 years ago, in October, (less severe) our family had just planned a ski trip but my dad got a travel ban set on him which cost us thousands that we had saved up for a long time.
Last year, in October, our very good family friends had the dad in the family die from a surgery that had never been failed by the surgeon who did it, and he had done it hundreds of times.
And this year, in October, we lost one of our 2 cats and the one we lost was essentially just my cat that spent the most of his time with me sitting on my lap if I'm playing video games or sleeping in my bed every night and then we came home and thought he was just lying on the street (because it's a very quiet street and he like to be outdoors too) and I walked up to him to pet him and take him inside since it was pretty late, but he had blood out his mouth and had very clearly been run over so me and my mom rushed him to an emergency vet but it was much too late.

If all life does is keep hitting me down a bigger hole year after year and I'm really not loved by anyone, why am I still living. It feels like my parents don't love me and all my 'friends' aren't really friends.

It just seems like no one cares about me or anything that happens yet I'm expected to care for others but if i keep getting blamed for everything even if it has nothing to do with me then ill blame everyone for my death.

I’m in the process of setting up a bean to bar mini factory + cafe in the city of Kochi in Kerala, India. 

Context: 
1. The state of Kerala exports about 36,000 MT of cocoa annually worth roughly USD 183mn. This makes it the 2nd largest exporter of cocoa in India. 

2. The retail & bean to bar side in Kerala however, for many reasons, is still under developed and growing. Existing chocolate shops sell sugary Bon Bons and brownies drizzled in Hershey’s syrup. 

Opportunity: 
The market for better quality chocolate and cocoa products is growing. 

1. In recent years, specialty coffee has grown in Kerala. 

2. High quality bakeries offering Gluten-Free and other dietary options has grown. 

3. A huge growing middle class and wealthier upper elite have very limited options for great coffee but even fewer for great chocolate. 

4. Tourism is huge here in Kochi, especially Fort Kochi. Commercial development is booming unlike other markets. The Kochi-Muziris Biennale takes place here, it is the largest art festival in India and arguably in contemporary Asia. 

I see an opportunity for a bean to bar operation for these reasons. 

Personal Competence: 
My brother and I are from Kerala but grew up in Dubai. He is now in Ottawa. He’ll advise me on this venture. 

Me: I’ve worked in CPG & Retail for 8 years in Brand Management and Category Management for Bob’s Red Mill, Laboratoire Puressentiel & adidas based in Dubai. 
I’ve worked at a cafe for about 3 months and ran my own pop up tea shop in Uni for a year. Although finance, marketing and brand building are my core competencies. 

Brother: Worked for specialty coffee roaster in senior sales roles for about 9 years. Managing food service and hotel accounts and supplying beans and equipment in Dubai. 
He also has extensive experience in Cafe Development (Menu creation, costing, sourcing, SOPs etc). Now in Ottawa doing the same there. 

Finally, our goal is to have a transparent bean to bar mini factory where we give tours, workshops and sell bars, gifting chocolate items and have a cafe alongside the factory. In 10-15 years, we want to be Hotel Chocolat in the UK. 

Any advice or tips on us getting into the cacao and bean to bar industry would be super helpful. I’ve read and listened to posts and podcasts from Clay from Pod Save Chocolate and others on here, thank you for all the advice you’ve posted on here.

1gwzn9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gwzn9k/when_midnight_calls_do_not_answer/,"When Midnight Calls, Do NOT answer.","It started as a dare.

My roommate, Jake, found the game on some obscure forum. The post was full of cryptic warnings and half-joking testimonials, the kind of thing you’d expect from a chain email circa 2005.

“Midnight Calls,” Jake read aloud, grinning like an idiot. “All you have to do is play, follow the rules, and survive until dawn. Piece of cake.”

I rolled my eyes. “What’s the point?”

“The point,” he said, “is that if you win, you get a wish. Anything you want. Money, fame, whatever.”

“Yeah, or a virus on your phone.”

But Jake wouldn’t let it go. By 11:50 PM, he had convinced me to play with him. It was simple, he said. The game required three things: a smartphone, a candle, and darkness.

We sat in the living room with the lights off, the flickering candle casting jagged shadows on the walls. Jake opened the app he’d downloaded—a plain black screen with a timer counting down to midnight.

“Ready?” he asked.

“This is dumb,” I muttered.

The timer hit zero, and the phone screen changed. A message popped up:

""Do you wish to begin? Yes / No.""

Jake tapped “Yes” without hesitation. My phone buzzed, showing the same screen. Reluctantly, I tapped “Yes.”

""Rule 1: Do not leave the house. Rule 2: Keep your candle lit. Rule 3: Answer when it calls.""

“What does it mean by ‘it’?” I asked.

Jake shrugged. “Guess we’ll find out.”

The first fifteen minutes were uneventful. We sat there in awkward silence, staring at our phones. Then Jake’s phone buzzed, the sound unnaturally loud in the stillness.

He answered, putting it on speaker. “Hello?”

A voice, distorted and crackling, hissed through the speaker. “Would you like to continue?”

Jake laughed nervously. “Yeah?”

The line went dead. A new message popped up on his screen:

""Rule 4: Don’t look behind you.""

I shivered despite myself. “Okay, that’s creepy.”

My phone buzzed next. I answered, my voice shaky. “Hello?”

The same distorted voice, but this time it whispered my name. “Would you like to continue?”

My stomach turned, but I forced myself to answer. “Yes.”

The line clicked off, and a message appeared:

""Rule 5: Don’t trust him.""

“Don’t trust who?” I asked, staring at the screen.

Jake looked up, his face pale in the candlelight. “What’d it say?”

“Nothing.”

We didn’t talk after that. The air grew heavier, and the shadows seemed to stretch farther with each flicker of the candle. I thought I saw something move in the corner of my eye, but every time I turned, there was nothing there.

Then Jake’s candle went out.

“Shit,” he hissed, scrambling to relight it. His hands were shaking so badly he could barely hold the match.

My phone buzzed again.

“Hello?”

The voice didn’t whisper this time. It growled. “He failed. Will you help him?”

I looked at Jake, who was still fumbling with his candle. “What happens if I say no?”

The growl turned into a low, guttural laugh. “You’ll find out.”

The line went dead, and my phone flashed a message:

""Rule 6: Don’t let him leave.""

“Jake,” I said slowly, “you can’t go outside.”

His head snapped up, his eyes wide. “Why not?”

“I don’t know, but the game—”

“This is insane!” He stood, grabbing his phone. “I’m done. Screw this stupid game.”

Before I could stop him, he headed for the front door. I lunged after him, but the moment he turned the knob, the air in the room shifted. It was like the atmosphere itself was sucked out, leaving behind a suffocating emptiness.

Jake froze, his hand still on the doorknob.

“Jake?” I whispered.

He turned to face me, but it wasn’t him anymore. His eyes were wrong, black and empty, and his mouth twisted into a grin that stretched too far.

“You broke the rules,” he said, his voice layered with something deeper, something inhuman.

I stumbled back, tripping over the coffee table. My candle flickered violently, and I scrambled to shield it.

Jake—or whatever was wearing his face—stepped toward me. “You should’ve stopped him,” it hissed.

The candle went out.

The last thing I saw before the room plunged into darkness was Jake’s face splitting open, revealing something sharp and glistening underneath.

I woke up on the floor at dawn, the smell of burnt wax clinging to the air. Jake was gone. His phone sat on the table, screen shattered, the app nowhere to be found.

There’s one last rule they don’t tell you:

If you lose, the game keeps playing.

Gather 'round, folks, because I've got a hot topic brewing directly from the digital kitchen of tech and governance.

Now, I don't know about you, but the mere mention of ""partial breakup"" might invoke memories of high school romances gone awry, but this, my friends, is no teenage drama. The US government is playing matchmaker, and it's looking like Google's love affair with its Chrome web browser might be headed for the rocks.

After a historic ruling, we find ourselves pondering the potential impact of the Justice Department urging a federal judge to orchestrate the sale of Chrome. It's like asking Superman to hang up his cape, or Batman to dismantle his Batmobile. Chrome has been a central fixture in Google's sprawling empire, a crane that helps build skyscrapers in the tech world.

So what does this mean for us, the digital citizens of today? Well, let's consider that Google Chrome has positioned itself as a de facto doorway to the internet for so many of us. It’s been more than a browser; it's practically been a virtual guide to the World Wide Web. However, the fear, the gist of this proposition, is that too much power concentrated in one corner spells a monopoly – and not the fun kind with hotels on Boardwalk.

The piece does a fine job of laying out the facts, like breadcrumbs leading to a bigger, meatier discussion: antitrust issues. Laying out a balanced view is a journalist's tricky dance, and I must tip my hat to the writer for tossing that tray with aplomb. These concerns aren't just corporate catfights; they echo in the halls of user rights and tech fairness.

But hey, Clyde McDive is not here just to nod in agreement. We'd be remiss not to ask ourselves if poorer alternatives might emerge should such titans be taken apart, Frankenstein-style. Is giving up Chrome too big a price, or is this the refresh button for a more competitive browser battleground? That's the golden question that deserves an answer without pop-up ads or buffering.

In conclusion, I say to you: Watch this space. This proposal is no Band-Aid; it's a major surgical operation on the body of the tech industry, and the incision might be felt all the way from Silicon Valley to your local coffee shop Wi-Fi. So, let's keep our browsers—and our minds—open. I'm Clyde McDive, reminding you to think fast, browse safe, and as always, stay informed. Over to you!",1,1732249774.0,u_Bstillbstill23,0,1.0,False
1gwzkfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gwzkfb/delonghi_evo_models/,Delonghi Evo models,"Along with many others I'm looking at Black Friday deals for a bean to cup machine. In the UK, mainly drink americano. Had considered the Gaggia Brera but am leaning towards the Evo for slightly larger capacity. I am a bit confused about which Evo would be best for me.

They all do espresso and ""coffee"" but the plain Evo (292.33) also does americano and long, the Doppio (290.22) does doppio and the Long Black (290.21) does long. 

I'm thinking that to get 2 shots of espresso for an americano I might be best with the Doppio model, and then top up with hot water, rather than use the americano function on the standard Evo? Also confused by the difference between coffee and long black...

1gwzkei,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1gwzkei/frugal_and_still_worried_as_a_t1_diabetic/,"Frugal, and still worried as a T1 Diabetic ","I’m Frugal AF

I retired at 48, but “werk” in volunteering my time on various causes and am now 55 and am going to let some of these responsibilities go as well, my parents need more assistance at the end of their lives. Since RE my health has drastically improved and so has technology for managing Type1 diabetes in the USA. But I worry… 

I would love to hear feedback on our (husband [59] FIRE situation:

I bought our home 600k  in 2014, I refinanced when rates dropped to a 2.75 interest rate and threw another $200k into the mortgage to pay it down quickly. We’ve fixed up our home, (fire proofed best we can with Climate Emergency), new windows, roof, etc to make it sound/sustainable. We recycle grey water and capture rain for reuse (our water consumption is very low thus cheap.) we don’t heat with gas. No AC. 

We plan on paying off our home in 2025 ~ 12 mos. More

I have $500k in stocks $50k in bonds some miscellaneous company stock from previous employer and I don’t even know how to cash out (20k?) the public company has changed hands 

My car (a 14 yo Prius) is owned outright and it has 80,000 miles and it’s doing great

I purchased home solar system outright for energy (use space heaters in winter with this power), and the ROI has been met in 8 years

We bought a small pop up camper that we pull with a Subaru Outback (we’re still paying off at 0%) for vacation- we don’t crave foreign travel, we live on California coast. Taxes are about $14k now on home. 

Our home value looking at comps is valued at $1.45 mm (yes really) a good investment.

My husband’s 401k is currently at 2.5mm

His income is 180k. Healthcare is about 18k a year in copays for us (diabetes is financially catastrophic!)

I want him to RE too. Our big hurdle is the healthcare situation as with Type 1 Diabetes and being in good health- we worry still. We often wonder about medical tourism, and paying cash when time comes and we don’t have his company sponsorship of health plan. 

When his mother passes he will inherit her home currently valued at $550k and some investments from his parents. This is same with my parents. They own outright at $800k but I want my sister to have their home. 

I know this information is all over the place, but are there things I need to be doing to ensure we have enough to live out our lives meagerly?  We honestly live economically, no eating out, etc. no fancy hobbies, no alcohol 🍷, or coffee habits. The most expensive thing I am involved with is caring for my 3 pets ages 1.5, 8, and 16. We have no children.

Part 1 found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/s/ckjKeHPTzU

I stayed at the Banyan Resort this summer for the third time. To catch up on my experiences and get context to the story, please read the above posts. 

I was there for 3 nights. Nothing out of the ordinary happened up until the last morning there. The previous night, my husband and I got home pretty late, so we decided to sleep in before hitting the road. 

I’m usually the one that likes to sleep in later, so it wasn’t a shock to me when I woke to an empty room. My husband had gone out to get us coffee and breakfast. I was still groggy and wanted to go back to sleep. As I was finally falling asleep, something terrifying occurred. 

I vividly felt someone run their nails down the bottom of my foot, which was hanging off the side of the bed. Following that was children’s laughter. 

Being that I was still a bit out of it, I thought for a moment that I was at home with my kids and that they were messing with me. As I snapped out of it I realized once again that I was alone in the room at the banyan. 

So my gut told me it was the ghost of the little girl “playing games”. 

I accepted it, got out of bed, packed as I waited for my husband, and we had our coffee and food on the road. 

I agree that I’m being pulled back there from time to time. Maybe the ghost girl senses my maternal vibes. Or maybe it’s actually an evil entity in disguise. Who knows. But I don’t think I’ll take any further steps to find out.

My wife loves coffee and I got it as an early Christmas present in the hopes that it was in as good condition as advertised and also worked properly as my research suggested they are fantastic for espresso quality grind if you have the time and energy to do it manually.

Boy could I not be happier with the state and just sheer beauty of the piece. 

It took almost no beans to dial it down to espresso fine. Fewer beans and less time than the Mignon. And it can go finer than even wanted . Even at ultra fine espresso, as long as you really secure it, it takes shockingly minimal effort to turn and the resistance is insignificant. My 12 year old could crank the espresso.

# Power Independence Redefined 🌟

After seeing countless questions about portable power stations, I decided to share my extensive experience with the EcoFlow Delta Max 2000. Over the past six months, this beast has been my constant companion through camping trips, power outages, and even a small home renovation project.

Let me tell you - this isn't just another power bank. It's a game-changer for anyone serious about portable power or emergency preparedness.

# Technical Deep Dive 📊

First, let's get the nerdy stuff out of the way (and trust me, it's impressive):

3. **Price Point**: Premium features come with a premium price tag
4. **App Connectivity**: Sometimes glitchy with firmware updates
