1kc55bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1kc55bl/going_to_management_about_a_coworker/,Going to management about a coworker,"I have a coworker who has made me really uncomfortable several times because she’s very hard to work with. I go by a different name than my legal one and for awhile she wouldn’t call me the name I introduce myself with, the name that is printed on my name tag. This coworker, I’m gonna call her A, she also supposedly made a manager cry and quit because she wasn’t listening to the instructions from the manager, who she according to what I heard continued to yell at her and insult her for 15+ minutes and other management didn’t try to stop her. I have noticed this with A and I know it has been a problem where she will walk away from her work station and do something else. Management seems to let her get away with whatever. She does whatever she wants. 

For context we work in a coffee shop. Yesterday a supervisor, let’s call her B, put me on hot/iced drinks and A on espresso. I’ve been struggling to understand the management style where I work. One of my other managers has been working up there during a rush and is asking me to train him. I couldn’t believe it, and that happened twice with two different higher ups. I am also used to management delegating tasks but B was trying to get me to do it for the second time. I was getting a bit fed up truthfully because I hate getting expected to do management stuff when that isn’t my job, and I’ve been setting boundaries with them because I refuse to do more work for the same pay. If they want me training and delegating tasks that’s a supervisor role and they need to pay me more. 

Anyway, I handled only the hot/iced drinks per B’s instruction and once I was done with those, I took the time to clean, restock, and organize. A wasn’t keeping her space clean at all. It was a mess. She left the ice scoop in the big thing of ice we have. One time I worked at another company and that happened. Maybe it was overkill but it was considered cross contamination so we had to toss the entire thing. I don’t see cleaning/servsafe policies getting used when they’re supposed to. Other baristas often don’t wear gloves. 

I did hear A talking to herself as she was making the drinks. I was focusing on restocking and didn’t hear the content of what she was saying. Then eventually A walked off to do whatever she wanted. After that, B told me A was complaining and annoyed that I wasn’t helping her. First of all I was helping her by organizing/restocking. But I suppose she wanted help on the espresso machine and she never mentioned it to me. I told B that we’re adults and if she needs help she needs to communicate that to me. I can’t help her if she never says a single thing to me. I’m getting frustrated because we are supposed to work as a team. Then B said that I shouldn’t help A regardless because A will get annoyed at that too. She kinda takes over the workspace and I don’t know if she expects everything to go her way or what. I don’t really understand how to interact with management at this job. That wasn’t constructive from B at all. If it isn’t constructive, why am I even being told any of this? 

I feel uncomfortable with A. I also am really struggling with understanding the management style but I don’t think I’m going to bring that up in the meeting. I don’t know if I should. I wanna go to my manager about A. How should I approach this with him? If there are managers who have insight on this I welcome all your thoughts. I always wanna better myself as a person or employee if I can. ",1,1746094129.0,managers,0,1.0,False

Now, every thing I loved to eat or drink gives me diarrhoea, I get bloated real easily, I get massive stomach cramps. I quite often get really tired once I eat something my body dislikes and then sometimes pain or sometimes the runs follow. I'm typing now feeling constipated and my stomach is gurgling.

I'm not sure what my trigger foods are other than dairy, oily stuff, acidic stuff.

The other day my missus bought a microwave curried sausages meal and I was so tired after I work I didn't think and just ate it. I had diarrhoea for 2 days (lucky it was over the weekend).

I have imodium and when I take it it helps with diarrhoea but then I get bloated and constipated for days, and it's expensive.

My doctor sent me for blood and stool tests and said everything looks fine, it's IBS. Find out what your trigger foods are and avoid them.

Im 33 male, it is so demoralising going out for dinner (not that I can really afford it) and thinking wow this menu looks great if I want to ruin the next few days, I'll just get a schnitty and even then it feels like I could cramp up at any moment.
I don't go out for coffee because if I find a black coffee that isn't bitter it still might make me feel crap.

The other night I had pork chops for dinner (fatty), and decided to try my luck with 1 Easter chocolate that my brother got me, it was mostly a hazelnut with a little bit of chocolate, to wash it down I had a orange and cinnamon tea which smelled incredible.
Half way through my tea after the chocolate I had to run to the toilet and sit there for an hour.

My missus feels bad eating everything in front me, I say don't worry about it, it isn't your issue.  But it is killing me to the point where literally if it was killing me I'm not sure I'd be sad.

What can I do to make this more bearable? My old doctor has left but what tests can I ask a new doctor to do?

1kc4z5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Wispa_us/comments/1kc4z5r/news_from_the_factory_the_end_of_working_remotely/,News from The Factory: The End of Working Remotely,"A significant transformation affects The Factory. The management recently declared that remote work has expelled all administrative and office workers from their home offices. The new company order demands full-time office attendance with no remote work options available for any employees.

The announcement created surprise among numerous people. The practice of working from home transformed into an essential lifestyle after its adoption several years ago. The real benefit of remote work consists in a legitimate freedom to master and optimize working hours without any risk of untraceable absence which misinformed critics associate with remote work. Remote work enabled employees to take control of their daily arrangements which they valued for achieving a necessary work-life harmony.

[Remote work](https://wispa.us/) entered the workforce for the first time during the COVID-19 initial outbreak period with a bumpy transition. Most individuals underwent severe feelings of loneliness during remote work. The normal informal encounters during coffee chats and the open discussions that happened naturally vanished because staff could no longer occupy their physical workplace together. The magic refuge of home started to transform into an oppressive space that polished its bars for certain fortunate individuals.

Time proved to be an essential factor for human adaptation. The pandemic shifted offices at home into spaces where people found success with their work. Workers obtained better focus along with increased productivity levels due to the absence of open-plan arrangements and numerous business meetings. Surprisingly industry-wide research proved that employee productivity did not decline but actually increased in numerous sectors. Workers discovered different patterns of operation while employees gained better work-life equilibrium and eliminated their daily transit to and from work.

# Given all of this, the question looms large: Why the sudden reversal?

The main concern about remote work appears as an inherent need for control of work activities together with a fear of losing such control.

From the viewpoint of a business owner managing time-based work without supervision feels risky because it requires blind faith in employees. Remote work creates unforeseen uncertainties for companies that base their traditional productivity measures on employee presenteeism.

The decrease of productivity remains uncertain even though situations where work performance declines should trigger legitimate concerns. We cannot ascertain certainty because of this situation. The loss of visibility makes leaders speculate negatively because they think employees are finding ways to take advantage of the resulting situation without proper work monitoring.

# Trust forms the fundamental basis of this issue.

The continuous achievement of productivity metrics along with client deliverables and deadline meetups factually demonstrates remote work effectiveness. The underlying issues of trust tend to exist beyond factual consideration. Remote work has not reshaped workplace dynamics between employers and employees which continue to generate emotional responses from enduring employment relationships.

A sense of division between groups exists today within some parts of corporate culture. Senior managers and owners treat employees as constantly looking for better terms while grasping any available opportunities. Workers sometimes regard their organizational leaders as both selfish and uncompassionate characters who lack employee trust. Remote work seems to have made this long-standing managerial-employee separation worse for certain employees.

The transfer to remote work served as a final point of surrender for those leaders who exhibited poor trust in their teams. The return to office demands from leadership functions as their straightforward approach to recover management authority by observing actual labor and monitoring work rates closely as well as creating employee accountability through being physically present.

https://preview.redd.it/cdz4e9ny75ye1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd297e626745ff936f39ddfb51b345c071ec40a5

# But is that truly the solution?

The repetitive cycle of mistrust presents companies with a major business opportunity that they are currently failing to see. Contemporary businesses which embrace forward-thinking approaches know that creating trust-based employee empowerment and holding them accountable from any location remains vital for achieving sustained business success.

An employee who is trusted and engaged performs outstanding work no matter if they sit at the office desk or work from home.

Remote work requires employers to transform company culture toward a new professional environment. The new definition demands employers to redefine how productivity looks so results become the new criterion instead of tracking worker seat time. Workplace culture today demands a new perspective on the established workplace belief that visible work equals successful work performance.

Workers must prove their worth to gain and keep remote work flexibility. It’s not a given. The sustainable nature of remote arrangements depends exclusively on high performance together with reliable delivery and clear communication between team members. Employee success in remote work depends on understanding the obligations of this situation which match our in-office responsibilities before COVID-19 emerged.

Sadness emerges from this movement since progress toward flexible work environments and mutual trust relationships seemed promising for the future of businesses.

On the other hand in-office work continues to offer various benefits. Naturally occurring group collaboration and team connections and spontaneous methodological discoveries occur better between co-present individuals. Multiple factors exist which support the return of personnel to work together physically. The combination approach that divides employee work time between home-based work and office settings has gained popularity as a solution that benefits two worlds. Such setups provide employees with organized scheduling together with social contact though they retain some freedoms.

Employees need open and honest communication about the reason behind remote work termination to prevent destructive effects on workplace morale. Management without trust indicates that employees receiver no matter how well they have performed in the past. It stands as an unwanted piece of information that proves difficult to accept given how remote work has become established as both practical and effective over several years.

Companies operated by satisfied employees develop into contented companies. The practice ""Happy Employees Result in Happy Life"" presents authentic wisdom even though it appears to be a casual motivational catchphrase. Remote work privileges are less expensive for businesses than the financial losses businesses experience due to employee disengagement and resentment and retirement.

Monitoring the way back-to-office transition at The Factory will determine its ultimate outcome. Will productivity really improve? Will team morale stay strong? Leadership should make efforts to restore trust between employees and management instead of enforcing control measures.

# Only time will tell.

People who appreciated remote work benefits need to readjust their routines to the office environment. We will develop novel working patterns while restoring previous business procedures while striving to sustain the efficient work ethic regardless of our physical work location.

I will provide updates about my return to the office while incredibly interested in your thoughts regarding this topic.

I would like to ask, does anyone experience sinus inflammation from the histamine rich substance that they ingest?

I happen to have terrible left nostril pressure, and I really do not know why, I had braces for one year, and I've been really struggling with it since, and I haven't experienced this pain before my braces treatment.

Now I am really looking for the possible connection, could it be that this sinus pressure / inflammation be histamine related?

I feel pain in my left nostril, it is like a sharp needle, combined with a feeling of a very cold air going in. When I use the tissues to wipe my nose, I am bleeding. 

This pain radiates from my nose to my front maxillary incisors (front teeth).

I drink coffee, just like I used to, but I have not experienced this phenomenon prior to now, before I have decided to start braces treatment. 

However, I had some histamine related issues from coffee, and histamine rich foods.

Coffee has made my skin to go really dry, I was pale from it, and histamine rich foods, like herring and some aged beef, cheese was really taxing on my gut.

Could it be, that histamine related issues are getting worse in subsequent years, or is the connection to my existing sinus issues coincidental?",1,1746093207.0,HistamineIntolerance,0,1.0,False

In December 2022 my grandma possibly had a stroke. We don’t know, because she didn’t want to go to the hospital. The next day, she started getting symptoms of dementia. By now, she is kind of still there, she recognizes me, but I now manage all of her business and she is in a nursing home.

My dad had a heart attack in 2017, died on the operating table, was brought back to life and has since been sick. I have done everything in my power to help him, but he finally passed away last Monday, aged 73. 

This leaves me basically alone with my toxic mother. I still can’t break contact, because I’m scared without my help she will lose my childhood home and throw out my dads belongings. To make things worse, my dad said he wanted me to get along with her a few days before his death.

I’m not even sure where I’m going with this. Just needed it out. I’m feeling extremely depressed and I am supposed to move into the house he gifted me in a couple of weeks. We are still in the process of renovating it and the bills and everything is just overwhelming without knowing my dad has my back. I’m so done after fighting for a lot of years. I’m also supposed to finish my PhD and I’m sure my coworkers wonder when I’m coming back to work, since I’m in a leading position. 

I just can’t right now. I don’t want to leave my living room. 

Today, my husband and I are going on a bike ride together, because my dad loved riding his bike when he was still able to. He was also quite frugal, so we are packing a lunch in his honor instead of eating out.

1kc4ppa,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1kc4ppa/bullying_and_toxic_work_environment/,Bullying and Toxic Work Environment,"Looking for advice for my partner to pass on.

  
She works in a deli and one of her colleagues, will call her Sam for purposes of this (F21) is having a lot of issues with the owners wife (F50 ish) Will call her Jane. The owner of the deli we will call John (M 50ish) works there full time as a chef.

  
Jane the wife is not an employee there but is always present. She has accused Sam and John of having an affair and has banned them from working together in any capacity, she will not allow them to be in the same room alone, so Sam is not allowed into the kitchen without Jane being present.

  
The accusations are completely baseless and nothing has ever happened. However Jane makes Sam's working life a living hell. Constantly belittling her appearance, behavior and basically anything that Sam does. 

She often does this in front of paying customers as Sam is not working front of house, she shouts at her and calls her names daily. Most days this causes Sam to break down crying.  

  
Jane also does things like chuck her coffee cup onto a tray of dishes that Sam is carrying to be washed causing her to drop and break the whole tray.

  
Yesterday for whatever reason Jane came in in a foul mood and seemed to make it her mission to break Sam, Sam had a full breakdown and my partner had to take her to the back room where she spent an hour crying uncontrollably on the floor. 

  
Jane has approached my partner today to apologize for the 'atmosphere' of yesterday but has said there is a 'deep seam of hatred between her and Sam, and that she will never forgive her, as you don't poke fun at people who have had cancer, (Jane had cancer) but my partner didn't press this, as she doesn't want to get stuck in the middle, but has no idea what she was talking about.

  
From what my partner has been telling me this seems like a fully grown woman bullying and belittling basically a child, Infront of customers to the extent of her having multiple breakdowns and being terrified of coming to work, and causing an extremely tense and toxic environment to work in.

  
The obvious advice would be for Sam to quit and find another job but she doesn't want to. Is there any advice my partner can pass on, technically Jane is not an employee there just the boss's wife but is always present. 

  
I have suggested contacting ACAS, but unsure if they could do anything as Jane is not actually employed there. Any other advice would be welcomed. My partner said it is heartbreaking to see such a young woman being treated this way, but doesn't want to get in the middle of the 'feud' and cause issues for herself, but would like some advice to pass onto Sam.

  
This is in the UK

  
Thanks in advance

I have stomach pains mainly right side under ribs but also left side too, stomach bubbling and gas all day

1kc4o1j,https://i.redd.it/sfjb880j25ye1.jpeg,Hey guys! Little announcement,"Since today is my birthday, I wanted to announce that I'm working on a volume of short stories that I will upload on my BuyMeaCoffee account, that will include 10 new, original shorts. I've started exploring some new concepts regarding horror and I think they're an upgrade writing-wise from my usual Nosleep posts, but they share the same vibe. I'm so excited for you to read them! 

Here's a sneak peek of the first paragraphs: 

*It started as a rustle, heard only if you listened carefully enough. Most of us didn’t need to see or hear anything, anyway – they always felt the next one in their bones, and any time it approached, they instinctively shut everything down and stayed indoors.*

*I’d grown up in the area, and our farm was no stranger to tornadoes and storms. Nothing surprised us, nothing scared us anymore. Our home remained unmoved, a giant standing up at the beginning and end of golden fields.*

I love writing horror and I hope that in the next year I'll be able to really grow as a writer. This collection started as two ideas of mine, one regarding an island (that you'll get to meet soon!) and another regarding someone getting buried alive. I'll keep posting on Nosleep, obviously, but I also wanted to put out this collection because it's not affected by Nosleep guidelines, so there's more freedom:)",3,1746092162.0,u_EmmaWatsonButDumber,0,1.0,False

So I turn to reddit for help.
This is my first time in an apartment and my first time not living with my parents. I was very excited about this apartment I'd been able to snag because it's in a building where a bunch of my friends also live. I work a seasonal job which allowed me to meet these people, including my current roommate. I worked with him and liked his vibes, and so when he let me know there was a room opening up in the apartment he lived in I jumped at the chance to move in. I moved in and things start off a little awkward, but I figured that could be the fact that I did move in with almost a complete Stanger. One of the first things he mentioned to me was how ""immature"" the decor in my room was. While I Thought that was a bit rude, I'll admit he wasn't 100% wrong. I let it slide because I had just moved in. Fast forward a couple weeks and I realize this guy is a major weed smoker, and when I mention I don't appreciate that he smokes joints in the apartment and that my things are starting to smell like weed he tells me it's his apartment and he can do what he wants. (Keep in mind our apartment is a no smoking apartment) We eventually settled on a compromise of him smoking in his room only (which i now realize he only follows when im home)
Fast forward a couple more months and I start to realize I'm the only one cleaning things up in the apartment. Brushing crumbs off the counters, cleaning up spilled food, doing the dishes, vacuuming the floors, keeping the bathroom clean. For awhile I was doing almost all of his dishes, as well as my own (the apartment doesn't have a dishwasher) I stopped doing his dishes and only leave mine in the sink a maximum of a day, while his dishes now sit for a minimum of a week in or around the sink until he does them. Our kitchen constantly reeks of rotting food. When I try to bring up the fact that he isn't cleaning anything, he blows up at me and starts nit picking all of the things I leave in the communal spaces. Which really isn't that much most of the time, I'll forget socks in the living room overnight, or my coffee mug on the coffee table when I go to work, but I usually pick things up as soon as I realize I left them there. 
Come January i let him know I'll be on a trip for almost the entire month, so he will have the apartment to himself. When I return, the whole apartment REEKS of weed, and I can clearly tell he hasn't cleaned the entire 4 weeks I've been gone. A couple days after I get back, I get a text from him accusing me of being the reason he had to take his cat (9 F literally the only perk I can find of living with him) to the vet. She is a strange being who loves plastic and eats it when she finds any. I am aware of this fact and have been conscientious of that since I moved in. Apparently she had been throwing up a lot and wasn't eating and ended up having a blockage that he accused me of being the cause behind because I had some vinyl sleeves on the bottom shelf of my bookcase that she had never shown any interest to before that time. I think at the time I also hadn't picked up my room before I'd gone on my trip? So there probably was trash on the floor, but it shouldn't have mattered because i had been gone for the entire month and therefore my door should have been closed the whole time I was gone. I didn't mention that fact because i could tell he was worried for her and just was trying to look out for her.
He also has told me that I'm the reason we are going to get ""white people robbed"" because I'll leave the blinds open when he is home and I leave and I don't always lock the doorknob when I leave for work, but I ALWAYS lock the deadbolt, which will do more for preventing break-ins then anything.
As i type this out I seems super lame and maybe I'm overreacting, but there are also other things I didn't mention here because this post is already long, but I've got screenshots of our text conversations and the way he talks to me over text i can add if that would help things

Sorry this is long, but I truly do not know what to do about this. AITA? Or is he just gaslighting me?

1kc4gs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1kc4gs3/sharing_again/,Sharing again.,"Dear You,

I’ve been trying to figure out how to write this without sounding bitter, broken, or like a character in a sad indie film. But who am I kidding? If you’re reading this—scratch that, I doubt you are—then this is probably already checking all those boxes.

I still don’t know why you did it. One day we were talking about kids—tiny humans with messy hair and mismatched socks—and the next… silence. No warning. No “We need to talk.” No slow fade. Just—“Let’s take a break.” Four words. No punctuation. Like a gentle push off a cliff.

It’s funny (and by funny, I mean soul-crushing) how quickly everything ended. You weren’t just my girlfriend. You were my best friend. My partner in crime. The only person who understood why I always checked if the door was locked after locking it. Ten years. Gone faster than a cheap paper towel soaks up a spill.

And yes, I would’ve fought for us. I would’ve argued, debated, negotiated, grovelled even—had you given me the chance. But you didn’t. You pulled the parachute and left me in freefall, staring at the same blank screen you probably typed those words on.

I still haven’t found closure. I waited. For a text. A call. Smoke signals. Anything. I waited for a year, in case you were testing some twisted theory about distance and time. Turns out, I wasn’t in an experiment. I was just… forgotten.

Now, I’m beginning to forget things too. Not dramatically. Not like in movies where someone burns photos and screams into the void. Just slowly. Casually. The kind of forgetting that sneaks in through repetition—like when I stop mentioning your name out loud because it doesn’t roll off the tongue as easily anymore.

But the scar? Oh, that’s still there. You left it without even touching me. That takes talent.

I hope this tear stops showing up for you. I really do. It’s become a bit of a drama queen lately—popping up during songs, smells, cities, coffee shops. I hope I forget the letters I wrote and never sent, the what-ifs I clung to, the late-night arguments I rehearsed alone just in case you came back.

I hope we don’t run into each other. Not because I hate you—because I’d rather keep the version of you I remember, than face the awkward silence between two people who once planned everything and now say nothing. Because nothing is louder than that silence. And without closure, it echoes. Louder still when one person holds on and the other lets go like it was nothing.

So, here it is. The unsent letter. No dramatic ending. Just gratitude for the good parts. Resentment for the way you left. And a weird mix of both for everything in between.

Thank you for the memories. And for the ghosting. Spectacular job on that, by the way.

Take care. Or don’t. I’m not really in charge of that anymore.

Can you recommend me a realistic model (SDXL based preferrably, FLUX is a bit slow to use on my 3070 RTX) that is good in understanding posing prompts?

For anime/cartoon style I currently use NoobAI and other Illustrius checkpoints, but I struggle with realistic images a lot. Usually I just generate a good pose as a cartoon and use it as a base for realistic generations, but it would be nice to be able to skip that drafting step. It would also be good if it were not overly obsessed with censorship, but even 100% SWF model will do if it will understand posing and camera angles.

We eat the brain here, so no brain tanning. I only have access to iodized salt, which is ok but not ideal.

First, I wash the gunk and dirt off the skins and salt the flesh side. After they dry into salted rawhide, I'm not quite sure what to do with them.

I threw a cinnamon stick into the liquid I brewed using tea and some wood chunks, hoping that the antimicrobial properties would keep things from rotting too quickly.

To economize the process, my first thoughts are to cut off the feet and let the skins sit in the detergent bath so that some of the fur starts slipping.

could I just start oiling the raw hide?

A lot of supplements promise the world but deliver disappointment. But what happened after I actually tried MITOLYN? Let’s just say: **my body, energy, and life haven't been the same since**. In this honest 2025 review, I’m going to share **my complete personal experience**, **what I liked**, **what could be better**, and most importantly — why I believe MITOLYN is **worth every penny**.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://545f0qydm0hh0n0iujxdce6k1f.hop.clickbank.net/)

# 🚨 Why I Started Using MITOLYN

At 42, I felt older than I should.

* I was tired all the time.
* My focus was fading.
* My joints ached.
* I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.
* And worst of all, I was starting to **lose my confidence**.

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted **real answers** and a **real solution**.

That’s when I discovered **MITOLYN** – a supplement designed to **restore mitochondrial health** (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

# ⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a **science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement**. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences **energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance**, and even **longevity**.

Key benefits they promise:

* Boost energy naturally
* Improve focus and brain performance
* Support healthy weight management
* Reduce joint pain and inflammation
* Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a **too-good-to-be-true checklist**. But I gave it a shot.

# 🔬 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the **premium, research-backed ingredients** that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

* **CoQ10** – Supports cellular energy and heart health
* **PQQ** – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Improves mental clarity and memory
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – Fights oxidative stress
* **Resveratrol** – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties
* **Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12** – Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a **synergistic formula** that targets the **root cause of fatigue and aging** — mitochondrial decline.

# ✅ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed — 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:

# ✅ Week 1:

* Slight increase in morning energy
* Clearer mental focus during work
* No crash in the afternoon like before

# ✅ Week 2:

* Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed
* Digestion felt smoother
* Less brain fog
* I started to feel “lighter”

# ✅ Week 3:

* My energy levels felt **stable and strong all day**
* I could **focus better at work for longer periods**
* My workouts improved — less joint pain
* I noticed a **mood boost** too — more optimistic

# ✅ Week 4:

* I felt like **I got my younger self back**
* I stopped reaching for coffee
* My weight dropped by 3 pounds
* I felt **clear-headed, more active, and even happier**

# 💥 Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

After one month, here’s what changed drastically:

* ⚡ **Energy:** I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.
* 🧠 **Focus:** Mental clarity and attention improved big time.
* 🔥 **Metabolism:** My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.
* 💪 **Recovery:** Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.
* 🦴 **Joint Relief:** Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.
* ✨ **Overall Mood:** I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.

# 😬 MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the **downsides** — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:

# 1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a **science-backed long-term upgrade**.

# 2. Premium Price

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — **it’s worth the investment**.

# 3. Limited Stock

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN **sells out often**. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.

# 💯 Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?

Absolutely, **yes**.  
If you’re:

* Feeling constantly tired
* Struggling with brain fog or poor memory

# 🚨 Why I Started Using MITOLYN

At 42, I felt older than I should.

* I was tired all the time.
* My focus was fading.
* My joints ached.
* I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.
* And worst of all, I was starting to **lose my confidence**.

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted **real answers** and a **real solution**.

That’s when I discovered **MITOLYN** – a supplement designed to **restore mitochondrial health** (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

# ⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a **science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement**. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences **energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance**, and even **longevity**.

Key benefits they promise:

* Boost energy naturally
* Improve focus and brain performance
* Support healthy weight management
* Reduce joint pain and inflammation
* Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a **too-good-to-be-true checklist**. But I gave it a shot.

# 🔬 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the **premium, research-backed ingredients** that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

* **CoQ10** – Supports cellular energy and heart health
* **PQQ** – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Improves mental clarity and memory
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – Fights oxidative stress
* **Resveratrol** – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties
* **Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12** – Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a **synergistic formula** that targets the **root cause of fatigue and aging** — mitochondrial decline.

# ✅ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed — 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:

# ✅ Week 1:

* Slight increase in morning energy
* Clearer mental focus during work
* No crash in the afternoon like before

# ✅ Week 2:

* Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed
* Digestion felt smoother
* Less brain fog
* I started to feel “lighter”

# ✅ Week 3:

* My energy levels felt **stable and strong all day**
* I could **focus better at work for longer periods**
* My workouts improved — less joint pain
* I noticed a **mood boost** too — more optimistic

# ✅ Week 4:

* I felt like **I got my younger self back**
* I stopped reaching for coffee
* My weight dropped by 3 pounds
* I felt **clear-headed, more active, and even happier**

# 💥 Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

After one month, here’s what changed drastically:

* ⚡ **Energy:** I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.
* 🧠 **Focus:** Mental clarity and attention improved big time.
* 🔥 **Metabolism:** My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.
* 💪 **Recovery:** Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.
* 🦴 **Joint Relief:** Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.
* ✨ **Overall Mood:** I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.

# 😬 MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the **downsides** — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:

# 1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a **science-backed long-term upgrade**.

# 2. Premium Price

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — **it’s worth the investment**.

# 3. Limited Stock

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN **sells out often**. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.

# 💯 Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?

Absolutely, **yes**.  
If you’re:

* Feeling constantly tired
* Struggling with brain fog or poor memory
* Battling joint pain
* Gaining unwanted weight

Then MITOLYN can literally be the **missing piece** in your daily routine.

# 🚨 Why I Started Using MITOLYN

At 42, I felt older than I should.

* I was tired all the time.
* My focus was fading.
* My joints ached.
* I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.
* And worst of all, I was starting to **lose my confidence**.

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted **real answers** and a **real solution**.

That’s when I discovered **MITOLYN** – a supplement designed to **restore mitochondrial health** (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

# ⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a **science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement**. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences **energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance**, and even **longevity**.

Key benefits they promise:

* Boost energy naturally
* Improve focus and brain performance
* Support healthy weight management
* Reduce joint pain and inflammation
* Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a **too-good-to-be-true checklist**. But I gave it a shot.

# 🔬 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the **premium, research-backed ingredients** that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

* **CoQ10** – Supports cellular energy and heart health
* **PQQ** – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Improves mental clarity and memory
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – Fights oxidative stress
* **Resveratrol** – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties
* **Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12** – Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a **synergistic formula** that targets the **root cause of fatigue and aging** — mitochondrial decline.

If you're reading this, you're probably like me just a few months ago — frustrated, bloated, and desperate for real gut relief. Let me be 100% honest: I was skeptical about Prime Biome. I’ve wasted money on “gut health” supplements in the past that either did nothing or made things worse. But something about Prime Biome’s claims, reviews, and science-backed ingredients made me give it one last shot. And I’m so glad I did.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://fdf82qzdsccf6mdn5brdrhweuc.hop.clickbank.net/)

This is my **real and raw experience** with Prime Biome. I’m not a doctor, I’m not paid to write this, and I’ve definitely had my fair share of complaints. But after using Prime Biome for **120 days straight**, I can confidently say this product **changed my life** — and in this review, I’ll break down:

* My personal gut struggles
* What happened in the first 7, 30, and 90 days
* Real complaints I had (and how they were resolved)
* Why I believe this is the only gut health supplement worth your time in 2025

# 🔍 Why I Even Tried Prime Biome (My Story)

For over a decade, I battled daily bloating, gas, constipation, and random food sensitivities. I tried clean eating, probiotics, herbal teas, intermittent fasting — nothing gave me long-lasting relief. Doctors would tell me it's ""just IBS"" or “stress-related,” but I knew something deeper was going on in my gut.

After seeing a gut health video on YouTube where a woman swore by **Prime Biome**, I searched for reviews and came across a few that mentioned “real results.” Still skeptical, I dug into the ingredients and was shocked by what I found:

* **Soil-based probiotics (SBOs)** that survive stomach acid
* **Bacillus coagulans** — clinically shown to improve gut flora
* **Turmeric extract** for inflammation
* **Digestive enzymes**
* And no fillers, gluten, or artificial junk

I ordered the **3-bottle pack** (because the 1-bottle price was higher per unit) and told myself: “Let’s see if this does anything.”

# 🗓️ My Results: Day 1 to Day 120

# Week 1: The Detox Phase

I'll be honest — the first few days weren’t magical. In fact, I felt slightly more bloated, which made me nervous. But I remembered reading that **gut rebalancing** sometimes causes temporary discomfort. By Day 5, my digestion felt *lighter*, and my morning bathroom trip wasn’t a battle anymore.

# Week 2–4: Less Bloating, Better Sleep

By the end of the first month, I noticed something huge — **my cravings were disappearing**. I didn’t feel the urge to binge sugar or salty snacks. I was sleeping deeper, and my stomach looked visibly flatter. I even lost 3 lbs without changing my diet.

# Month 2: Energy, Regularity & Skin Changes

This was the turning point. I felt more energized in the morning, less foggy, and my skin (which always broke out during my cycle) looked clearer. My digestion was consistent, and I didn’t dread meals anymore. I finally felt in control of my gut.

# Month 3–4: Long-Term Transformation

This is where Prime Biome really proved itself. I could eat out without fear. My mood swings decreased. I was going to the gym regularly. My body felt like it was finally absorbing nutrients the right way.

Let’s be real — no product is perfect. I had a few issues, and here they are:

1. **The Price** At first, I thought it was expensive. But when I broke it down, I realized I was spending more on antacids, snacks (to “soothe” my gut), and other supplements that did nothing. The cost per day is about $1.60 — less than a coffee.
2. **Initial Detox Symptoms** The first few days of discomfort scared me, but Prime Biome’s team explained it’s normal. It passed quickly, and looking back, it was my body adjusting to real gut healing.
3. **It’s Not Sold in Stores** I wish it was in Walgreens or Whole Foods. But I guess the company wants to control quality and avoid fakes. That’s why I only buy from their **\[official website\]** — fast shipping and fresh stock.

# ✅ Why I Recommend Prime Biome to Everyone

If you’ve ever struggled with:

* Chronic bloating
* Inconsistent bowel movements
* Brain fog and fatigue
* Sugar cravings
* Skin breakouts linked to gut issues
* Anxiety or mood swings...

… then **Prime Biome** could be the missing piece.

This is **not just another probiotic** — it’s a **scientifically formulated gut repair system** that works with your body, not against it. The soil-based organisms, enzyme blend, and anti-inflammatory agents are what make it unique.

And here’s the kicker — **it comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee**. So even if it doesn’t work for you, there’s zero risk.

# ⭐ Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?

Yes. A thousand times YES.

I’ve tried over 12 gut products in the last 5 years. None of them made a difference long-term. Prime Biome is the only supplement that delivered visible, emotional, and digestive transformation — and continues to work **4 months in**.

Don’t waste another year feeling sluggish, bloated, and helpless.

This is your sign to take control of your gut health today — your body will thank you, your mind will feel clearer, and you’ll wonder why you didn’t try it sooner.

👉 **My advice? Get the 3-bottle bundle.** You’ll save money, have enough to truly see results, and you’re covered with their refund policy anyway.

This is my **real and raw experience** with Prime Biome. I’m not a doctor, I’m not paid to write this, and I’ve definitely had my fair share of complaints. But after using Prime Biome for **120 days straight**, I can confidently say this product **changed my life** — and in this review, I’ll break down:

* My personal gut struggles
* What happened in the first 7, 30, and 90 days
* Real complaints I had (and how they were resolved)

# 🔍 Why I Even Tried Prime Biome (My Story)

For over a decade, I battled daily bloating, gas, constipation, and random food sensitivities. I tried clean eating, probiotics, herbal teas, intermittent fasting — nothing gave me long-lasting relief. Doctors would tell me it's ""just IBS"" or “stress-related,” but I knew something deeper was going on in my gut.

After seeing a gut health video on YouTube where a woman swore by **Prime Biome**, I searched for reviews and came across a few that mentioned “real results.” Still skeptical, I dug into the ingredients and was shocked by what I found:

* **Soil-based probiotics (SBOs)** that survive stomach acid
* **Bacillus coagulans** — clinically shown to improve gut flora
* **Turmeric extract** for inflammation
* **Digestive enzymes**
* And no fillers, gluten, or artificial junk

I ordered the **3-bottle pack** (because the 1-bottle price was higher per unit) and told myself: “Let’s see if this does anything.”

# 🗓️ My Results: Day 1 to Day 120

# Week 1: The Detox Phase

I'll be honest — the first few days weren’t magical. In fact, I felt slightly more bloated, which made me nervous. But I remembered reading that **gut rebalancing** sometimes causes temporary discomfort. By Day 5, my digestion felt *lighter*, and my morning bathroom trip wasn’t a battle anymore.

# Week 2–4: Less Bloating, Better Sleep

By the end of the first month, I noticed something huge — **my cravings were disappearing**. I didn’t feel the urge to binge sugar or salty snacks. I was sleeping deeper, and my stomach looked visibly flatter. I even lost 3 lbs without changing my diet.

# Month 2: Energy, Regularity & Skin Changes

This was the turning point. I felt more energized in the morning, less foggy, and my skin (which always broke out during my cycle) looked clearer. My digestion was consistent, and I didn’t dread meals anymore. I finally felt in control of my gut.

This is my **real and raw experience** with Prime Biome. I’m not a doctor, I’m not paid to write this, and I’ve definitely had my fair share of complaints. But after using Prime Biome for **120 days straight**, I can confidently say this product **changed my life** — and in this review, I’ll break down:

* My personal gut struggles
* What happened in the first 7, 30, and 90 days
* Real complaints I had (and how they were resolved)

# 🔍 Why I Even Tried Prime Biome (My Story)

For over a decade, I battled daily bloating, gas, constipation, and random food sensitivities. I tried clean eating, probiotics, herbal teas, intermittent fasting — nothing gave me long-lasting relief. Doctors would tell me it's ""just IBS"" or “stress-related,” but I knew something deeper was going on in my gut.

After seeing a gut health video on YouTube where a woman swore by **Prime Biome**, I searched for reviews and came across a few that mentioned “real results.” Still skeptical, I dug into the ingredients and was shocked by what I found:

* **Soil-based probiotics (SBOs)** that survive stomach acid
* **Bacillus coagulans** — clinically shown to improve gut flora
* **Turmeric extract** for inflammation
* **Digestive enzymes**
* And no fillers, gluten, or artificial junk

I ordered the **3-bottle pack** (because the 1-bottle price was higher per unit) and told myself: “Let’s see if this does anything.”

# 🗓️ My Results: Day 1 to Day 120

# Week 1: The Detox Phase

I'll be honest — the first few days weren’t magical. In fact, I felt slightly more bloated, which made me nervous. But I remembered reading that **gut rebalancing** sometimes causes temporary discomfort. By Day 5, my digestion felt *lighter*, and my morning bathroom trip wasn’t a battle anymore.

# Week 2–4: Less Bloating, Better Sleep

By the end of the first month, I noticed something huge — **my cravings were disappearing**. I didn’t feel the urge to binge sugar or salty snacks. I was sleeping deeper, and my stomach looked visibly flatter. I even lost 3 lbs without changing my diet.

# Month 2: Energy, Regularity & Skin Changes

This was the turning point. I felt more energized in the morning, less foggy, and my skin (which always broke out during my cycle) looked clearer. My digestion was consistent, and I didn’t dread meals anymore. I finally felt in control of my gut.

# Month 3–4: Long-Term Transformation

This is where Prime Biome really proved itself. I could eat out without fear. My mood swings decreased. I was going to the gym regularly. My body felt like it was finally absorbing nutrients the right way.

# ⚠️ My Complaints — And Honest Thoughts

Let’s be real — no product is perfect. I had a few issues, and here they are:

1. **The Price** At first, I thought it was expensive. But when I broke it down, I realized I was spending more on antacids, snacks (to “soothe” my gut), and other supplements that did nothing. The cost per day is about $1.60 — less than a coffee.
2. **Initial Detox Symptoms** The first few days of discomfort scared me, but Prime Biome’s team explained it’s normal. It passed quickly, and looking back, it was my body adjusting to real gut healing.
3. **It’s Not Sold in Stores** I wish it was in Walgreens or Whole Foods. But I guess the company wants to control quality and avoid fakes. That’s why I only buy from their **\[official website\]** — fast shipping and fresh stock.

# ✅ Why I Recommend Prime Biome to Everyone

If you’ve ever struggled with:

* Chronic bloating
* Inconsistent bowel movements
* Brain fog and fatigue
* Sugar cravings
* Skin breakouts linked to gut issues
* Anxiety or mood swings...

i’ve been on lex for a while now, and i remember how terrifying it felt in the beginning. i googled every side effect, overanalyzed every weird body sensation, and kept wondering if it would even *work*.  
but now, looking back — it’s one of the best decisions i ever made for my mental health.

it didn’t fix everything overnight (spoiler: it’s not magic lol), but it *did* lift that heavy cloud just enough for me to breathe again. like suddenly i could actually pause between the anxious spirals, the intrusive thoughts weren’t as loud, and i could go through a day without feeling like the world was ending over spilled coffee.

some side effects are normal at first — weird sleep, slight nausea, feeling kind of flat emotionally — but for most people they pass within a few weeks. give your body some grace while it adjusts.  
and please remember: needing help doesn’t make you weak. taking meds doesn’t make you broken. it makes you *brave as hell* for trying to take care of yourself.

whether this is your first time trying meds or your fifth — i’m proud of you. hang in there. it *can* get better. 💛

just keep always sure you have it covered — currently i’m literally begging people to help me buy my meds and it’s been rough. so please, take care of yourself, make a plan if you can, and don’t wait until it’s a crisis. you deserve stability. sending love to anyone out there fighting the silent fight. 💊💕",5,1746090603.0,lexapro,1,1.0,False

I have to adjust the extraction ratio from 1:15 to 1:7 or 1:8, then compensate for the remaining ratio by adding ice. However, this leads to incomplete extraction, affecting the flavor.  

I found an alternative solution, but it’s time-consuming: brewing the coffee hot and then refrigerating it. I also visited a café in Saudi Arabia that serves cold coffee by brewing it hot, placing it in a container surrounded by ice (similar to a chocolate-melting bain-marie), cooling it for 10 minutes, and serving it with ice-filled cups. I tried this method, but it wasn’t better than my initial approach.  

Currently, my preferred method is using the **AeroPress**: I add the desired coffee grounds, pour hot water, extract it via pressure and filtration (like espresso), but replace part of the water with ice. This gives me the best results in terms of time and extraction.  

I’d love to hear your experiences with cold coffee: How do you achieve the highest extraction yield? If precise ratios aren’t your focus, what method delivers the best flavor in your opinion?  ",1,1746090566.0,pourover,6,1.0,False

1kc4a1g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kc4a1g,For sale: Krups Pixie Nespresso machine with 4 reusable pods,"Hello. I am looking to sell my 2.5 year old Krups Pixie Nespresso machine. It comes along with 4 reusable aluminium pods which means you can use whatever coffee you prefer. Picked it up from Germany, so no valid warranty/bill etc, and don't know if it is locally available anyway. Have not had any issue at all, and makes reasonably good espresso-adjacent coffee.

Reason for sale: upgrading

Price: 12.5K 

(Price rationale: new Delonghi one in the same segment is >22K INR I believe, plus the pods were about 80 euros, so this price seems fair to me. Plus it covers my new Flair Neo)

Location: would prefer local handover in Mumbai. Can also post at your cost after payment has been made.

To mods: I checked the community rules and this seems kosher, but if I have missed something or gone against the general spirit of the community, please let me know, it would be an honest mistake.

1kc49xm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1kc49xm/when_to_pull_the_plug/,When to pull the plug?,"Hi, for reference, 41M single no kids (not planjing to have any) with circa 1.6MEUR assets of which a nice paid house and boat near the sea in spain where I want to retire. Rest in investments.

Also nice job that lands me 140KEUR take home, putting aside 100K of that every year and living a very good life that I enjoy a lot with 40K expenses (including 18K for apartment in the city for when I go to office sometimes, so should I retire I would live on 22K). Also teleworking a lot, meaning I spend almost 6months full time in summer in Spain already and most of the time travel around in winter, e.g. this winter went to canada, thailand 2 times 1month, malta, croatia. And my job feels like I am always in vacation, just a few hours a week and little stress. Being in europe, I would get a reasonable pension from around the age of 55 of 2k a month if I stop now and of course that goes a little bit higher the longer I stay. Health insurance also not an issue being french.

Now, I have always thought I would retire early but I am now having doubts. Fact is I already have the time to do whatever, already have the life I dreamt of and I don't dislike my job (don't like it either, let's say neutral) as it gives me so much freedom and income.

So I am wondering, what made you pull the plug as I feel like I could stop but have no idea what more/else I would do as I am happy about my life. At the same time, what's the point of making more I'll have to spend it at some point given I have no kids. I realise that's quite a lucky position (which I worked hard for but now enjoying the fruits) but working till 65 is also pointless. Generally, I am a simple person and don't like fancy stuff, best for me is spending hours drinking a coffee looking at the sea and then going for an afternoon on the boat swimming and fishing. So I don't necessarily want a bigger boat or house.

I don't know, what made you make the move if you already had the life you wanted?

Thanks for reading, and looking forward to your answers!

1kc47mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kc47mt/the_silence_on_redfield_road/,The Silence on Redfield Road,"

On a quiet street in the town of Hollow Creek, something changed forever on the night of August 17, 2019.

Redfield Road had always been the kind of place where people left their doors unlocked, where neighbors nodded politely and kept to themselves. So when 42-year-old Melanie Grant was found dead in her living room coffee cup still warm, front door slightly ajar it didn’t just shock the community. It fractured it.

Melanie was a local schoolteacher, known for her quiet nature and deep love for literature. She lived alone, had no criminal record, and no known enemies. The idea that she was murdered in her own home felt impossible. Yet there she was slumped over on the sofa, a single stab wound below the rib cage. No signs of forced entry. No valuables taken. Nothing disturbed except her silence.

The investigation began the following morning, after her colleague and close friend, Rachel Dunn, called the police when Melanie didn’t show up for a Saturday workshop. Detectives quickly ruled out robbery. There were no fingerprints on the weapon a kitchen knife, wiped clean and placed back in the drawer. It was almost surgical, precise.

Suspicion first fell on her ex-boyfriend, Thomas Reid, a local handyman with a rough past. They had split a year earlier after a short, rocky relationship. He admitted to stopping by her house a few days before her death, claiming he wanted to ""check in."" But his alibi security footage showing him at a bar during the time of death checked out.

Then came the detail that changed the case.

One of Melanie’s neighbors mentioned seeing a car parked near her house late that night. A blue Honda Civic windows down, engine running, driver inside. Police traced the vehicle to a 19-year-old named Evan Merrill, a former student of Melanie’s.

Evan was quiet in school, often kept to himself. Melanie had once mentored him through a difficult semester and even helped him apply for community college. They had stayed in contact loosely, mostly through email. But something had shifted. Investigators later found a journal in Evan’s room filled with entries about Melanie some respectful, others obsessive, almost delusional.

Under questioning, Evan broke.

He claimed he had gone to visit Melanie to “talk about something personal,” but said they argued, and he “just snapped.” There were no signs of a struggle, but he confessed to stabbing her once in the side, panicking afterward, and trying to make it look clean. He left her there, alone, and drove off into the night.

Evan Merrill was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison the following year.

To this day, some in Hollow Creek still leave flowers at Melanie’s gate. Her death was more than a tragedy it was a reminder that even in the quietest towns, the people we least suspect sometimes carry the darkest",1,1746090148.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I've been on Vyvanse for about a year for ADHD-PI. In the beginning my doctor kept increasing the dosage until I was taking 50mg in the morning and a 40mg redose at lunch.

At the time I was both studying and working part-time. Sometimes I only took the morning dose and skipped the lunch one. I started noticing tolerance. I was also using a lot of nicotine and drinking caffeine. When I skipped meds for a couple of days I realized the high doses were making me too hyperfocused to the point where I became unproductive. Like, I’d spend hours programming or obsessing over trivial stuff forgetting to eat etc. And on the days I didn’t take it I was basically useless overeating and sleeping all day.

After a longer med break I tried starting again but 50mg was too much. Then 40mg also felt too high. I still had some 30mg capsules from titration and that dose was perfect. It put me in the right zone: not too wired or tunnel-visioned but focused and calm enough to function well.

So my doctor suggested 30mg + 20mg as my new combo and it worked great. I also quit abusing nicotine, cut down on energy drinks and coffee, and only use PWO occasionally. My blood pressure had been a bit high. Not dangerously high but above average for my age (28M).

Anyway, to get to the point: my doctor prescribed guanfacine to help with blood pressure and said it could also help with anxiety. I also have PTSD symptoms (mild hypervigilance), generalized anxiety disorder, and chronic sleep issues. Right now, I’m on week 2 of 2mg guanfacine.

The only side effect I’ve noticed is extreme tiredness. Even when I take my morning Vyvanse I still fall back asleep. I was told that the sedation would go away after a few weeks as my body adjusts and the right dose is found.

But I haven’t noticed any clear benefits yet. Maybe slightly less anxiety? I’m not sure. It also feels like the Vyvanse doesn’t work as well the lethargy kind of overrides it. My doctor said the two should complement each other, since they work on different parts of the brain like Vyvanse is the gas and guanfacine is the brake.

They’re also both supposed to help with executive function and working memory. Guanfacine in particular is supposed to help with emotional regulation, which I definitely need lol.

Sorry for the wall of text. I’m just curious, has anyone here had a good experience with guanfacine and Vyvanse combined? I’ve mostly read positive things and that they balance each other out. What are your experiences?",1,1746089596.0,VyvanseADHD,1,1.0,False

------------

Losing weight feels impossible sometimes, no? Many diets promise much, give little results. You try hard, but the scale does not move much. It is frustrating. One way some people try is **intermittent fasting** (IF). Today, I talk about one type: **20/4 intermittent fasting**. This means you stop eating for 20 hours each day. Then, you eat all your food in a 4-hour time. People ask, can this help **weight loss** in just one month? This article explores this question. We look at what results might be possible with the **20/4 method**. Remember, every person's body is different. What works for one may not work for another. This information is a general guide. It uses research and what people share about their experience. Let us see what one month of 20/4 IF could mean for losing weight.

I. Understanding the 20/4 Intermittent Fasting Method
-----------------------------------------------------

Maybe you heard about fasting but are not sure about 20/4. I will explain it simply.

### A. What is 20/4 IF?

The name 20/4 tells you the plan. Each day has 24 hours. For 20 hours, you have a **fasting window**. During this time, you do not eat food with calories. You can drink water, plain tea, or black coffee. Then comes the **eating window**. This is a 4-hour period each day. In these 4 hours, you eat your meals and snacks for the entire day. For example, you might fast from 8 PM one night until 4 PM the next day. Then you would eat between 4 PM and 8 PM. This cycle repeats daily. This method is also sometimes called the **Warrior Diet**. The main idea is a long time without food, then a short time to eat.

### B. How 20/4 IF Differs from Other IF Methods and its Intensity

There are other ways to do **intermittent fasting**. You might know 16/8 (fast 16 hours, eat 8 hours) or 18/6 (fast 18 hours, eat 6 hours). The 20/4 method has a much shorter eating time. This makes it more intense. The **fasting period** is longer. The time to fit in all your needed food is shorter. This can be harder to follow than 16/8 or 18/6. It needs more discipline. Because the eating time is so small, it often leads to eating fewer calories without strict counting. It is seen as an advanced **intermittent fasting** schedule. Starting with 16/8 might be easier before trying 20/4.

### C. The Science Behind Intermittent Fasting and Weight Loss

Why does not eating for some hours help with **weight loss**? Science gives some reasons.

- **Autophagy:** When you fast for many hours, your body starts a cleaning process. It is called autophagy. Think of it like your body's cells eating old, damaged parts. This keeps cells healthy. Some research suggests this might help overall health, maybe indirectly helping weight management. It is like tidying up inside your body.
- **Hormonal Changes:** Fasting changes hormones in ways that can help lose weight. Insulin levels go down significantly during fasting. Lower insulin helps your body burn stored fat for energy. Also, Human Growth Hormone (HGH) levels can go up. HGH helps burn fat and keep muscle mass. These hormone shifts make **fat burning** easier.
- **Calorie Restriction and Energy Balance:** This is maybe the simplest reason. With only 4 hours to eat, it is hard to eat too much food. People doing 20/4 IF often eat fewer calories naturally. They are not trying to count calories, but the short eating time limits how much they can consume. When you eat fewer calories than your body burns, you create a **calorie deficit**. This energy imbalance is the main driver for **weight loss**. Your body uses stored fat to get the missing energy.

II. Realistic Weight Loss Expectations for 20/4 IF in 1 Month
-------------------------------------------------------------

So, you follow the 20/4 plan for one month. How much weight can you really expect to lose? Let us look at realistic ideas.

### A. Average Weight Loss Range: Based on studies and reported data

It is hard to give one exact number. Research on strict **intermittent fasting** types, like 20/4, shows possibilities. Some studies and reports suggest people might lose around 4 to 8 pounds (about 2 to 4 kilograms) in one month. Sometimes more, sometimes less. This is not a promise. It is more like an average observation from groups of people trying similar fasting methods. Remember, initial **weight loss** is often faster. Some of this early loss can be water weight, not just fat. The rate of loss might slow down after the first few weeks.

### B. Factors Influencing Weight Loss Results

Why do results change so much between people? Many things affect how much weight you lose.

- **Starting weight and body composition:** Someone with more weight to lose might see bigger changes initially compared to someone closer to their ideal weight. Body composition (how much muscle vs. fat you have) also plays a role.
- **Adherence to the diet:** How closely you follow the 20/4 schedule matters greatly. Consistency is very important. If you often break the fast early or extend the eating window, results will be less. Sticking to the 20-hour fast daily is key.
- **Diet quality during the eating window:** What you eat in the 4 hours is crucial. If you fill those hours with junk food, sugary drinks, and processed items, your **weight loss** might be slow or stop. Focusing on whole, nutrient-rich foods makes a big difference. A **healthy diet** supports the fasting efforts.
- **Activity Level:** How much you move your body affects results. **Exercise** burns extra calories. It helps create a larger **calorie deficit**. Combining 20/4 IF with regular physical activity usually leads to better **weight loss** outcomes than fasting alone.

### C. Debunking Unrealistic Claims: Avoiding the ""miracle diet"" mentality

You might see amazing stories online. People claiming huge weight loss in one month with 20/4 IF. Be careful. Some claims are too good to be true. **20/4 intermittent fasting** is not magic. It is a tool that can help create a **calorie deficit** and may offer some metabolic benefits. But it requires effort and changes to your lifestyle. Expecting miracles can lead to disappointment. Focus on steady progress and building healthy habits. Sustainable **weight loss** is usually gradual.

III. Optimizing Your Diet During the 4-Hour Eating Window
---------------------------------------------------------

The 4-hour eating time is short. You need to eat smart to get enough nutrients and support **weight loss**.

### A. Macronutrient Balance: Protein, carbohydrates, and fats and their importance

Your body needs three main types of nutrients: protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Getting a good balance is important, especially with a short eating time.

- **Protein:** Helps you feel full. It is important for keeping muscle mass, especially when losing weight. Aiming for maybe 30-40% of your calories from protein can be useful.
- **Carbohydrates:** Give you energy. Choose complex carbs that release energy slowly. Around 30-40% of calories could come from carbs.
- **Healthy Fats:** Important for hormones and absorbing some vitamins. They also help with feeling satisfied. About 20-30% of calories from healthy fats is a good target.  
    These percentages are just ideas. The main point is to include all three in your meals during the **eating window**. Don't focus on just one type.

### B. Food Choices to Prioritize

Choose foods that give your body good nutrition. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.

- **Lean proteins:** Good choices are chicken breast, fish, turkey, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu. These help build and repair tissues.
- **Complex carbohydrates:** Eat things like brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole-wheat bread, sweet potatoes, lots of vegetables (broccoli, spinach, peppers), and fruits (berries, apples). These provide fiber and steady energy.
- **Healthy fats:** Find these in avocados, nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds (chia seeds, flaxseeds), and olive oil. These support overall health.

Eating these types of foods helps you feel full and get the vitamins and minerals your body needs. A **healthy eating** plan is vital.

### C. Foods to Limit or Avoid

Some foods can make **weight loss** harder. They offer little nutrition and many calories. Try to limit these during your **eating window**.

- **Processed foods:** Things like packaged snacks, fast food, frozen meals with many additives.
- **Sugary drinks:** Soda, sweetened juices, energy drinks. They add many calories with no fullness.
- **Refined carbohydrates:** White bread, white pasta, pastries, sugary cereals. These can spike blood sugar and leave you hungry soon.
- **Excessive alcohol:** Alcohol has calories and can affect your judgment about food choices.

Avoiding these helps keep your calorie intake managed and nutrition high.

### D. Meal Planning Strategies for 20/4 IF

With only 4 hours, planning helps. You need to fit enough food without feeling rushed or overly full.

- Maybe have two main meals within the 4 hours. Or one large meal and a smaller snack.
- Plan your meals ahead of time. Know what you will eat before the **eating window** starts. This prevents making poor choices when you are very hungry.
- Prepare food in advance if possible. Having healthy options ready makes sticking to the plan easier.
- A simple example: Meal 1 at 4 PM could be grilled chicken, quinoa, and roasted vegetables. Meal 2 at 7:30 PM might be Greek yogurt with berries and nuts, or a hearty lentil soup. Adjust based on your hunger and calorie needs.

IV. Incorporating Exercise to Enhance Weight Loss on 20/4 IF
------------------------------------------------------------

Combining **20/4 intermittent fasting** with **exercise** can boost your results. Movement helps your body in many ways.

### A. The Benefits of Exercise During Intermittent Fasting

Exercising while doing IF offers good points.

- **Enhanced Fat Burning:** When you exercise in a fasted state (before your eating window), your insulin levels are low. This might help your body burn more stored fat for energy during the workout.
- **Muscle Preservation:** Losing weight sometimes means losing muscle too. Exercise, especially strength training, signals your body to keep muscle mass. This is important because muscle helps burn calories even when you rest.

Regular physical activity complements the effects of fasting for better **weight loss** and body composition.

### B. Types of Exercise Recommended

A mix of different exercises is usually best.

- **Strength Training:** Lifting weights or using your body weight (like push-ups, squats). Do this 2-3 times per week. It builds muscle, which increases your metabolism (how many calories you burn).
- **Cardio (Aerobic Exercise):** Activities like brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming. Aim for maybe 150 minutes of moderate cardio per week. This burns calories directly and is good for your heart and lungs.

Finding an **exercise routine** you enjoy makes it easier to stick with it.

### C. Timing Your Workouts

When is the best time to exercise with a 20/4 schedule? There are different thoughts.

- **Exercising Before the Eating Window:** Some people like working out near the end of their 20-hour fast. This might maximize **fat burning** as glycogen stores (stored carbs) are low. However, you might feel less energetic.
- **Exercising During the Eating Window:** You could exercise after your first meal. You will likely have more energy. This might be better for intense workouts or strength training.
- **Listen to Your Body:** The best time depends on you. How do you feel? What fits your daily schedule? Try different times and see what works. Make sure to drink water before, during, and after exercise, no matter when you do it.

V. Potential Side Effects and How to Manage Them
------------------------------------------------

Starting **20/4 intermittent fasting** can be a big change. Your body might need time to adjust. Some people experience side effects.

### A. Common Side Effects

When first starting, you might notice:

- **Headaches:** Often due to dehydration or caffeine withdrawal.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired as your body adjusts to using fat for fuel more often.
- **Irritability:** Hunger can sometimes make people feel grumpy (often called ""hanger"").
- **Constipation:** Changes in eating patterns can affect digestion.
- **Dizziness:** Might happen due to low blood sugar or dehydration.

These effects are usually temporary. They often lessen as your body gets used to the new schedule.

### B. Strategies for Mitigation

You can do things to make the adjustment easier.

- **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially during the **fasting period**. Aim for clear urine. Water helps with headaches and fatigue.
- **Electrolyte Replenishment:** When you fast, you can lose electrolytes (salts like sodium, potassium, magnesium). Sometimes adding a pinch of salt to water or using an electrolyte supplement (with no calories) during the fast can help prevent headaches and dizziness. Talk to a doctor about this first.
- **Gradual Introduction:** Maybe do not jump straight into 20/4. Start with 16/8 IF for a few weeks. Then maybe try 18/6. Gradually increase the fasting time. This gives your body more time to adapt.
- **Adequate Sleep:** Getting enough good quality sleep is very important. Poor sleep can make side effects worse and affect hunger hormones. Aim for 7-9 hours per night.

### C. When to Consult a Doctor

**Intermittent fasting**, especially a strict form like 20/4, is not for everyone. It is important to talk to a doctor or healthcare professional before starting. Especially if you:

- Have any pre-existing health conditions (like diabetes, heart problems, kidney disease).
- Are taking medications (some need to be taken with food, doses might need adjustment).
- Have a history of eating disorders.
- Are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to conceive.
- Are underweight.

Your doctor can advise if 20/4 IF is safe for you based on your health status. Safety should always be the first priority.

VI. Real-Life Examples and Success Stories (with Caution)
---------------------------------------------------------

Hearing from others can be motivating. But remember, experiences are personal.

### A. Anonymized User Testimonials

Many people share their **20/4 intermittent fasting** journeys online or in communities. Some report good **weight loss** in the first month, maybe similar to the 4-8 pound range mentioned earlier. They might talk about feeling more energetic (after adjusting) or finding it simpler than counting calories. Others might say they struggled with hunger or side effects and found it too difficult. Some find it fits their lifestyle well, others do not. These stories show the variety of experiences. What one person feels is not what everyone will feel.

### B. Expert Opinions

Nutritionists and registered dietitians often view IF as one possible tool for **weight loss**, not a magic bullet. Experts usually stress the importance of food quality during the **eating window**. They highlight that **intermittent fasting** works mainly by helping people eat fewer calories. They also emphasize that long-term success depends on sustainable habits, not just the fasting schedule itself. Many advise starting with less restrictive IF methods first. They also always recommend checking with a doctor before starting.

### C. Emphasize that results are not guaranteed and depend on individual factors

It is important to say this again. No diet guarantees specific results for everyone. Your **weight loss** on **20/4 IF** after one month depends on you. Your starting point, your genes, your exact food choices, your activity level, how well you stick to the plan – all these matter. Comparing your progress strictly to someone else is not helpful. Focus on your own journey and health.

Conclusion
----------

We looked closely at **20/4 intermittent fasting** and **weight loss** results in one month. This method, with its 20-hour fast and 4-hour **eating window**, can help some people lose weight. This often happens because it naturally leads to eating fewer calories (**calorie deficit**) and may change hormones like insulin favourably for **fat burning**. Realistic results in one month might be around 4-8 pounds, but this changes a lot from person to person. Success depends heavily on sticking to the schedule, eating nutritious food during the 4 hours, maybe doing some **exercise**, and listening to your body. Remember the potential side effects and how to manage them, like staying hydrated.

This **20/4 method** is quite intense. It is not the right choice for everyone. Please, talk with your doctor or a healthcare person before you try this or any new eating plan. They can help you decide if it is safe and suitable for you. If you choose to try **intermittent fasting**, start slowly perhaps, pay attention to your health, and focus on building sustainable habits, not just quick results. Your well-being is most important.

1kc3wky,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1kc3wky/will_detox_tea_help_you_lose_weight/,Will detox tea help you lose weight?,"Let’s be real: we’ve all seen those “flat tummy tea” ads that promise dramatic weight loss with zero effort—and most of us are skeptical (for good reason). I was, too. But recently, I kept hearing about **Lulutox Detox Tea**, and unlike the other gimmicky stuff, the reviews seemed different. People were talking about **reduced bloating**, **more energy**, and gradual **weight loss**—without the laxative horror stories.

So I figured I’d test it out. I committed to 6 full weeks of drinking **lulutox tea** daily, and now I’ve got real, unfiltered results to share. If you’re wondering **will detox tea help you lose weight**, here’s what actually happened.

**Why I gave Lulutox a chance**

Honestly, I wasn’t looking for a magic fix. My main goal was to feel less bloated and get my energy back. I work a desk job, exercise 2–3 times a week, and eat relatively clean—but I was always tired and felt puffy, especially around my stomach.

I wasn’t expecting the tea to melt pounds off me, but if it could help **reduce cravings**, improve digestion, and support my routine—I was open to giving it a shot.

**What’s in Lulutox Detox Tea (and why it matters)**

I’ve tried teas in the past that turned out to be mostly flavored water or full of harsh herbs. But the **lulutox tea ingredients** actually made sense—13 natural superfoods, each included for a specific purpose.

Some of the standouts:

* **Matcha Green Tea & Oolong Tea** – Support metabolism and fat burning
* **Yerba Mate & Guarana** – Natural energy and focus, no crash
* **Sencha Green Tea** – Antioxidant-rich
* **Milk Thistle & Dandelion Leaf** – Traditional detox support
* **Ginseng, Nettle Leaf, Goji Berries, Lemongrass** – Calm inflammation, support digestion
* **Stevia Leaf** – Adds sweetness without calories or sugar

The tea is **vegan**, **gluten-free**, **soy-free**, and has about **18mg of caffeine per bag**—enough to feel awake, not jittery.

**What happened over 6 weeks of drinking Lulutox Tea**

**Week 1–2:**  
The first thing I noticed wasn’t weight loss—it was **less bloating**. My stomach felt lighter by the end of the first week. My jeans weren’t digging in by 4 PM, and I was sleeping better, too.

**Week 3–4:**  
My **appetite started to shift**. I wasn’t snacking as much, and I felt full longer after meals. My energy was also more steady throughout the day, and I stopped needing a second cup of coffee in the afternoon.

**Week 5–6:**  
When I finally weighed in, I was down **5.2 pounds**. It wasn’t rapid or dramatic, but it felt real—and I wasn’t restricting myself. I think it came down to fewer cravings, improved digestion, and more consistency in my routine.

So, **will detox tea help you lose weight**?  
If you’re looking for a quick fix, probably not. But if you’re building healthy habits and want extra support—**Lulutox detox tea does it work**, at least it did for me.

**Any side effects to report?**

I had zero issues. No cramps, no urgency, no surprises. A lot of people worry about **lulutox detox tea side effects**, and I get it—some detox teas are basically laxatives in disguise. But **Lulutox was super gentle**. The only thing I noticed was needing to drink more water to stay hydrated.

That said, if you’re on medication or have medical conditions, definitely consult a doctor before adding any detox product.

**Where to get it (and what to avoid)**

If you’re searching **lulutox tea where to buy**, go straight to the [**official Lulutox website here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST). I saw lookalikes on Amazon and other random sites, but I didn’t trust them.

Here’s the [**alternate purchase link I used**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) in case the other one isn’t working. Both had the 70% off deal when I ordered.

**Final thoughts: Is Lulutox a good weight loss tea?**

After using it daily for 6 weeks, I’d say **Lulutox Detox Tea** is one of the few herbal teas that actually supports sustainable change. It won’t do the work for you, but it can absolutely help with:

* **Reducing bloating**
* **Boosting energy naturally**
* **Controlling appetite**
* **Supporting fat loss** over time

It felt like a small shift that made everything else a bit easier.

If you’re looking for a **lulutox tea review** that’s real, here it is. It’s not hype—it’s just a solid, plant-based tea that supports your goals without messing up your body.

Anyone else tried it? Drop your experience or any **lulutox detox tea side effects** you came across. Curious to see if your results were similar.",1,1746088769.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

I kept putting ointment on it and then on a sunday i suddenly got red painfull spots that looked kinda like acne cysts. I could not even pee normally without pain 😨

I always did sex with condom, take good care my my private parta and overall hygiene and did regular stds testing. I always tested for the 5 main soa's hell did i know i should also test for herpes. They really should include herpes in those test!
I never get a cold sore and never got the herpes spots at my private parts.
 
I only had 3 relationships in my life and 1 fwb ( always used condoms) 

I went to the doctor and she took a swab and i was shocked by the result and i feel my life is over. Even the doctor did not thought it was herpes type 2.  I did alot of crying and feeling very depressed i am even considering trying anti depressants.  I am going to see a psycologist soon. I live i the NL and my doctor said only when i have more then 6 outbreaks a year she wants to give me the anti viral medicatiom for a longer time. ☹️ im like i want to prevent that from happening.  I have no idea when of from ho or how i got this. With sex and foreplay i am always mindfull and carefull.

It feels the universe is against me.
I also got a stomach surgeryin 2019 i lost about 53 kilo in a year. So having loose skin makes me ugly and insecure but i dont have money now for surgeries to get it removed.

I did alot of research and i am doing the following things:

1. I told my fwb about it because its the right thing to do even tho i started crying again because i now feel like a freak and who ever wants to date me again or get into a relationship.

( i also recently found out at the doctor i have other woman womb and cervix issues  (i got ectropion, hpv positive, and my vaginal cells are lighty abnormal 😥). I took me a while to mentally recover from that and now i got again something horrible.☹️

2. I am taking daily l-lysine 2400 mg per day.

3. I take 1.000 vit Cto hopefully help my imum system.

4. I have to take my daily multivitamin and 2x calcium because of my gastric bypass.

5. I dont smoke, rarely drink alcohol, dont do drugs since my whole life.

6. I try to eat more lysine rich foods and less argine.

7. I take 5.000 uid vit D with K2 every day.

8. I want to try meditation to reduce my stress because i dont handle stress good.

9. My sleep i have to work on.
My period i cannot control i do have a koperspiral because my body does not like hormones and the koperspiral was the only option becasuse normal birth control my body does not obsorb.

10. I am stopping drinking my daily espresso or strong coffee. I love strong coffee 😥 so i am switching to decaf and tea.

11. I finally after begging got the anti viral medicine called: Valaciclovir 500 mg for a daily maintance for max 6 months. Does anyone have side effects from it.? I got constant headaches.

12. I am back to eating meats. I am trying to eat healthy and low sugar. I am eating more like a medditarian diet. 

13. I used to get a brazilian wax done with sugar wax every 4 weeks.  I think i will still do that only get the hairs from my bikin line, bottom removed.  I heard waxing might trigger a outbreak. 
Does having pubic hairs but trimmed so its not too long hopefully help to make transmission rates smaller from woman to men?

14. What are the transmission rates now that i am on the medicine, and using condom and not having sex using while having shedding and outbreak from F to M?

15. How do i recognize shedding symtomps?  
Am i contagious for someone else during my shedding, outbreak and afterwards period?

If i touch my private part and acciddentally touch someone mouth does that person get then type 1 herpes?  Or if i accidently touch their private are do they get then also herpes type 2? Is the skin on skin contact contagious with the fluid inside the sores?  
Or also my muscus membrames liquids  from my private area if i for example get aroused?

And what are the transmission rate if i dont take the anti viral medicine but of course use condom and having sex while having no shedding and no outbreak? 

I read online some numbers but why is it higher from F to M then from M to F?

I Feel alone and dont know how to deal with this. 
I really could use a friend that knows how it is to deal with this having herpes type 2. If anyome is interested pm me 🌸

1kc3tat,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1kc3tat/i_called_the_health_department_after_being_fired/,I called the health department after being fired and got the owner fined $5k,"I got fired after a few months of my boss and I beefing, admittedly I wasn't a stellar employee, but my boss also freaking sucked. It was a coffee place, the summer was very very slow so sometimes she would catch me on my phone instead of deep cleaning, and I often would put on more of my personal taste in music instead of lo-fi or jazz music. Also I would often close about 15 minutes early when it had been dead for the last hour or so, and as a result like twice when a customer came at 5 to close I would just tell them I could only do tea or espresso. So definitely not saying it wasn't justifiable to fire me. 

However, she also sucked, she was homophobic and very sexist (yep women can be sexist against other women) and once commented that a college student who came in with their resume ""seemed way too autistic to work with"". 

The final issue was when the coffee shop was hosting a craft fair, one of my friends paid for a table and let a bunch of her friends sell 3-4 items at her table, because we all split the cost. When my boss saw me drop of the items, she told me I would have to pay an additional table fee for the ""principle of the situation"". So when a bunch of regulars came that day and asked where my items were (I crochet and had been posting on instagram that I would have things available to sell) and my boss was next to me on bar, I mentioned how I was unprepared to have to pay because it didn't make sense at all. 

The next day I got my termination email citing a bad attitude etc etc. 

She roasted all the coffee in house, but without a permit for the roaster, and she also lived out of her van so her dog would often be in the roasting room with her when not being operated. So I emailed the health department, they came the same week and fined her, and one of my friends who still worked there told me she had a mental breakdown and scream cried at all of them that if they ever spoke to me again they were fired. Obviously they all were already looking for better jobs so they just thought it was hilarious.

1kc3t40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetAudiophile/comments/1kc3t40/my_way_to_dali_speakers/,My way to Dali speakers,"Hey,

I have been reading up on this sub for a bit now. Just wanted to share with my journey and get some feedback, maybe suggestions, not sure if that is budget, but I guess, compared to brand new and other high end systems this is relatively budget. Haven't fully learned what price levels should I look for in audio space. 

But long story short, I used to love old locally made speakers, which are now considered vintage and praised for their warm sound and pretty much incorporating the highs, the lows and mids in one speaker, not sure if anyone is aware of radiotehnika s90 speakers, but this is where it all started. They are big and take much space and I used them for a while. Then due to space limitations and was in need for better sound for my TV, instead of doing the whole system, I decided to get a soundbar, please don't judge, but at that point I was convinced, that I wouldn't be able to get anything better at 500eur... 

Well I used them for a while. And while dialog wasn't bad, the subwoffer that came with it, felt non existent, especially for it's size. So around Christmas I gave my soundbar to my grandparents, as they would get more value out of it, considering, that dialog clarity and volume are the only things that matter to them and soundbar is definitely better option than TV speakers. 

So then I was researching and funny enough Chatgpt helped here a lot. So I got myself denon x1800h, found a good deal on amazon for around 350eur. Initially it suggested to buy Elac bookshelf speakers with svs pb 1000 subwoffer, which is what I was planning to do, but Elac speakers I ordered locally took really long time to arrive, which made me wonder about other options. Wanting something then, as my TV speakers were not great, I started looking into second hand market and got tempted by Dali Zensor 5 speakers pair, which I got for 380eur and I absolutely love them. Then I was looking for a center speaker, but by mistake got spektor series centre instead of zensor, but I used it for a bit. Then pulled the trigger on Svs PB 1000 subwoffer and absolutely love it. Got it brand new on amazon, but no regrets, one of the best 500eur spent. A bit later I found zensor center for 100 eur and zensor 1 speakers for 160eur, that I'm now using for surround. So far so good. The sound, the clarity, just makes me want to keep watching, listening and yeah. 

So definitely it took more time and more money to build this up than I initially planned and me being new to this, might be more than someone would call budget setup, at least it doesn't feels so for me, but looking at some prices for both new and used I guess, it still counts as such.

So far I have been thinking of potential upgrades in the future, as I will be moving from my apartment into a house, potentially adding Atmos speakers, as here I do not have benefit from it, due to sloped roof in the apartment. But additionally I thought of getting into higher end stuff, but obviously loving my Dali Zensor speakers, I was thinking of staying within the brand and upgrading to ikon series later on, which seem less accessible, there are couple of Ikon 6 for sale now for 550eur, which does seem like a bit of a jump, so not sure if they will match other speakers in the system and if the upgrade is even worth it. 

Maybe someone has a suggestion for improvement?

Right now the setup looks like TV mounted to the wall with center speaker below it on a small shelf, ear level. Underneath on a coffee table is the AVR, then both front speakers, about 1.5 meters from the TV at a slight angle towards couch, but not overlapping each other, not equally the same distance, as logistics do not allow it, but I used audessy to calibrate it.

If you really want to elevate your style, layering and styling [trendy graphic tees](https://graphic-tees.io/) can take your outfit from basic to standout without much effort. Whether you’re into vintage band shirts, quirky memes, or bold anime prints, here’s how to make them work in fresh, unexpected ways.

**The Classic Denim Jacket Combo**

There’s something timeless about pairing a trendy graphic tee with a denim jacket. It’s effortless, cool, and works for almost any occasion. For a laid-back vibe, go for an oversized tee with a slightly cropped denim jacket. Or, if you want a sleeker look, a fitted tee under a light-wash jacket does the trick. Bonus points if the tee’s design peeks out just right—subtle but still making a statement.

**Blazers for That Unexpected Edge**

Who says graphic tees can’t be dressed up? Throwing on a blazer over a themed tee instantly elevates your style while keeping things fun. A black blazer with a white graphic tee? Clean and sharp. But a patterned blazer with a retro-inspired tee? Now we’re talking personality. It’s the perfect mix of casual and polished, great for casual Fridays or even a night out.

**Layer with Flannels or Button-Ups**

For those in-between weather days, flannels or open button-ups are a no-brainer. A loose flannel over a trendy graphic tee adds texture and depth to an outfit. Roll up the sleeves, leave it unbuttoned, or even tie it around the waist for a ’90s throwback look. And if you’re feeling extra, try a Hawaiian shirt—it’s bold, but when done right, it’s pure style gold.

**Hoodies & Graphic Tees**

When comfort is key, layering a hoodie over a graphic tee keeps things cozy without sacrificing style. Let the tee’s design peek out from under the hoodie’s neckline or cuff the sleeves for a little extra flair. This combo is perfect for running errands, grabbing coffee, or just lounging in style.

**Accessorize Like a Pro**

Sometimes, it’s the little things that [elevate your style](https://graphic-tees.io/). A chunky chain necklace, a beanie, or even a cool belt can take a simple graphic tee outfit to the next level. If the tee has bold colors, match your accessories to one of the hues for a pulled-together look. Or keep it minimal with a sleek watch and clean sneakers.

**Final Thought: Have Fun with It**

At the end of the day, trendy graphic tees are all about self-expression. Whether you’re layering them under jackets, over long sleeves, or pairing them with unexpected pieces, the key is to have fun and wear what makes you feel good. After all, fashion should never feel stiff—just like your favorite tee, it should be easy, comfortable, and totally you.",1,1746087600.0,Post_Anything_,0,1.0,False

1kc3lk2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kc3lk2,Iced pour over finally tastes right - this recipe changed everything,"I used to struggle with iced pour over, always tasting diluted or flat. After a lot of trial and error, this simple recipe finally gave me the clarity, body, and chill I wanted. I'm hooked.

Recipe:

Coffee: 16g (medium-fine grind) Ice: 70g (in the carafe) Hot water: 150g at 91°C

Instructions:

1. Add 70g of ice to your server or carafe. Pre-cool your serving glass with cold water and ice-set aside for later.

2. Add 16g of medium-fine coffee to your dripper.

3. Brew with 150g of hot water (91°C) using your preferred pour-over method.

4. Swirl the carafe gently and wait until all 70g of ice has melted completely.

5. Drain the water from your serving glass (from step 1); keep the ice. Pour and enjoy.

Important notes:

1. Do not pour from the carafe until all the ice has melted.

2. Pre-cooling the serving glass ensures that no more ice melts during drinking, so don't miss this step.

3. I use 65-75 clicks on a Kingrinder K6 for a Burundi light roast. Your grind may vary- explore what works best for your beans.

I worked 15-hour shifts every day at the restaurant, barely enough time to catch my breath. Parties and banquets? They felt like they belonged to a different world—one I’d never be a part of.

I was just a waitress who was hip-deep in debt, a nobody in the eyes of most people. Therefore, when the Alpha announced the Mate Trial, I figured I would be the only one in the pack who would be completely unaffected.

Besides, even if I was interested in the trial—which I wasn’t—I had no time to take part. I couldn't afford to stop working for even a second, still drowning in the medical debt I took on years ago to save my baby.

“Oh, it’s just so exciting. The chance to be the Alpha’s mate! I hope he picks me!”

As I wiped down the table and listened to a nearby conversation between two women, I sighed quietly. It wasn’t the first time today I’d heard this very conversation, and it wouldn’t be the last, either. I put a wad of tips in my apron as I heard her friend reply.

“I can’t believe all eligible females are being summoned for this Mate Trial. But I mean, it’s nice that the Alpha plans to consider everyone, even the more… unfortunate ones.”

The woman’s gaze flicked to me, and I reddened.

It was no secret around these parts that I was a ‘workaholic’ waitress, which was frowned upon in the shifter world. Most females would rather go to the salon, shop, and go to parties, but I was here every day, working hard.

The comment didn’t bother me too much, though. I liked taking care of myself and brightening the days of my customers that came into the diner.

Besides, there was no way that I was going to participate in this Mate Trial. But these girls didn’t know that.

“Everyone thinks he’ll choose Ava Blake anyway since the Blakes are such an elite family,” the other woman replied with a wave of her hand. “It will give him more connections.”

The conversation faded as I walked behind the counter and topped up a cup of coffee for one of our regulars, who grunted his thanks. My coworker, Betty, smiled at me as she walked past.

“Agnes Blake, Ava Blake,” Betty mused under her breath. “You’ve both got the same last name.”

“Never heard of her. Must be a coincidence,” I replied quickly.

Of course, everyone within 1000 miles of Bark Hollow knew who Ava Blake was. Even lone shifters knew about my stepsister. Our family was prestigious, and word got around fast about how beautiful she was.

But Betty just shrugged, either not caring to press it further or choosing to believe what I said. Either way, I was grateful to spend another day under the radar. If anyone found out that a Blake daughter was waiting tables… Well, it would raise plenty of eyebrows and ruffle just as many feathers.

After all, why would the daughter of one of the most well-known families be waiting tables to pay off medical debt?

No one would understand that there were many reasons behind why I had left my family’s shadow, things I didn’t want to get out.

Things that were painful.

I couldn’t care less about this Mate Trial or my stepsister’s part in it. I also firmly believed that this Alpha would not choose Ava to be his bride. As part of his Mate Trial announcement, he’d also mentioned his prior marriage and his six-year-old daughter—she would be a package deal that came with marrying him, and taking care of her was one of the stipulations mentioned.

My stepsister loathed kids with the same level of disgust she showed to the insects in the garden. She’d never make it past the first stage of the trial.

Just then, the bell chimed to announce a new customer. I glanced up to greet them with a smile but was met with the sight of my best friend, Elise, eyes wide with worry as she barged through the door.

I hadn’t seen Elise in a few months. She’d been my best friend for my entire life, but I’d decided it would be best to minimize contact with her, in case my family tried to follow her to track me down. Not that they had. Or would, for that matter.

My eyes widened. “Eli—”

“Bathroom, now,” she ordered by way of greeting. Whatever it was had to be serious if it had her acting like this after not talking for months. Frowning, I tugged off my apron and followed her. Once we were in the bathroom, she locked the door behind us.

“Elise? What’s wrong?” I asked, confused.

Her red curls were wind-blown, and her blue eyes were red and puffy. She’d been crying. She put her hands on my shoulders and took a deep breath.

“Aggie, I know it’s been awhile, but I desperately need a favor. A major one. I’ll owe you big time.” When I didn’t answer her right away and just stared at her in shock, she added, “Please, Aggie.”

“Alright, alright,” I finally said. “What is it?”

“I need you to pretend to be me and go in my place for the Mate Trials.”

I blinked. “You need me to what?”

“Please, Agnes.” She paused, shuddering a little. But there was also a tiny smile touching her lips. “I… I’ve met someone. Someone I truly love. My mate. But my parents don’t approve and want to throw me into the Mate Trials to get into better standing with the pack!”

Tears began to streak her face. She wiped at them with her sleeve. “Please, Aggie. You’re the only person I can come to. I need your help.”

“Your parents would find out in a heartbeat,” I said immediately.

“Yes, but by the time they do, my mate and I will be gone. We’re leaving the pack. We have it all planned out.”

“What about me?” I found myself asking. I wanted to help my friend, of course, but this was risky. “If we get caught… And besides, I can’t stop working. I have to pay off that medical debt—you know that.”

“You’re a Blake by birth,” Elise pleaded, “which protects you from any fallout, and you’re an eligible female with the right to participate. The Alpha won’t punish you. And I’ll… I’ll pay you.”

For a moment, I just stood there, stunned. But then I shook my head as thoughts of seeing my stepsister began to turn my stomach. “I don’t want to see Ava—”

“Fifty thousand dollars.”

I blinked at Elise, wondering if I had just heard her right. Fifty grand…

I owed so much money and interest on my debt… fifty thousand dollars would change everything. Even if it meant having to see her or potentially getting a slap on the wrist for taking Elise’s place.

“O-Okay,” I finally squeaked out. “I’ll do it. For you.”

Elise squealed and hugged me. “Thank you, thank you! I have to go—we’ll catch up once it’s all over—but here.” She shoved an envelope into my hands. “My invitation,” she informed me as she began unlocking the door. “Be there at noon. Don’t be late!”

I put on the simplest dress I could find in my closet, a pale blue chiffon with a hemline below the knee, paired with plain white flats. I wasn’t looking to draw the Alpha’s attention, if there was even a slim chance he would be interested in me. I kept my makeup simple, not accentuating my full lips or gray eyes, and I pinned my long dark hair up in a bun at the base of my head.

My current look wouldn’t turn heads compared to the other women, that was for sure. But I wasn’t trying to turn heads. I was just trying to blend in long enough for the trial to be over, and then I could get my money.

I took a deep breath as I walked through the large ivory, ornate doors of the Alpha’s mansion. “Are you Elise Matthews?” The burly guard at the entrance asked.

I nodded, and bit my lip nervously, but he waved me on through. My shoulders relaxed. The room he’d waved me into was already filled to the brim with other girls.

It looked like I’d been the last to arrive, but thankfully, none looked my way.

Just like I thought, they were dressed similarly to me, but with hemlines slightly shorter. Most had full blowouts and a lot more makeup, but I’d expected that too. I kept my head down as I found a seat in the corner of the room, thankful that so many people were here. It would make it much easier to go unnoticed.

I glanced up through lowered lashes and saw Ava across the room, chatting with one of her friends.

She luckily hadn’t noticed me, but I marveled at how she looked the same as the day I had left. Not one thing had changed about her, and she seemed like she hadn’t lost any sleep over what had happened, either.

Not that I was surprised. I watched the way she held the attention of the rest of the girls, enrapturing her audience like a queen. It made me glad that she could do so at this moment because it meant that it was more likely that I would slip through these Mate Trials unnoticed, without a second glance from any of these girls.

And hopefully, the Alpha would pass me over and grant me a quick exit that would bring me closer to the plans I had in mind once I finished this farce and Elise gave me that money.

Suddenly, the room began to stir, interrupting me from my thoughts.

The burly guard entered. “Introducing Alpha Elijah Hudson!” he boomed.

The girls who were seated stood. The others preened as the Alpha walked through the doors, murmuring and giggling amongst themselves, but I kept my head down and stuck to the corner.

My view was also blocked by the girls, so I only caught a quick glimpse of a large, toned bicep as the Alpha walked in before I glanced back down, curling my hands into my dress.

He walked around for a minute, not saying a word. The room was so silent you could hear a pin drop, save for the clicking of his shoes against the marble floor.

And then: “Everyone, leave. Except for you.”

I let out the breath I’d been holding in relief. Well, he had chosen someone rather quickly. Which meant I could go home.

With a chorus of confused and disappointed murmurs, the girls in front of me filtered out of the room, and I stood to do the same. But as I scanned the rest of the room, my stomach sank. Something was wrong.

All the girls had left.

I lifted my head and met the icy gaze of the Alpha, Elijah.

I gaped at him. “Me!?”

# #Chapter 2: The Alpha

My heart pounded as I held his steely gaze. I’d never seen him before in person. Still, he embodied every physical descriptor I had heard customers give him at the diner: extremely fit, tall, dark, and handsome--with ice-blue eyes.

The type of eyes a girl could get lost in.

Those eyes narrowed.

“Yes, you. You seem to have incorrectly identified yourself, Miss…?”

I swallowed hard. I needed this façade to work for a little longer, or Elise’s parents would catch her before she and her boyfriend left town. I titled my head to the side in pretend confusion.

“There must be a misunderstanding. I’m Elise Matthews; I handed my invitation to the guard on the way in.” I crossed my arms.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a phone. He pulled something up on the screen and showed it to me. It was a picture of Elise, who, might I add—looked absolutely nothing like me.

Crap.

“Everyone who RSVP’d was required to send their picture in with their application. Are you really saying this is you?” He raised a dark eyebrow.

I swallowed and took a deep breath, realizing that there was no point in trying to lie to the Alpha now. Especially not with those blue eyes trained on me. “My name is Agnes Blake. My best friend Elise…her family was going to force her to be here when she already has a mate. She asked me to cover for her.”

The Alpha snorted. “So she left you with the possibility of an impersonation charge if you were caught? Some best friend she is.”

I felt my stomach twist a little. “She’s helped me a lot in the past. She needed my—”

“Do you want to be here?”

I paused at his sudden interruption. Of course I didn’t want to be here, but my mind floated to that life-changing money again. Plus, he didn’t exactly look angry. Maybe I could stay, just until the trials ended, then Elise would pay me and it would all be okay.

“Yes, I do,” I lied.

The Alpha looked at me for a moment, scanning me as if sizing me up. His blue eyes wandered my dress, my hair, an eyebrow quirking at my lack of makeup. He sighed. “Well, your friend’s secret is safe with me. But as for you…”

He placed a hand on his hip and tapped his finger for a moment, considering. My heart pounded, but I managed to keep my expression calm and steady.

Finally, he strode over to the room’s door and beckoned someone over. It was a woman in a maid’s uniform. “Please show Miss Agnes Blake to the Mate Trial dormitories.”

The maid nodded and beckoned me to follow her. I gave the Alpha one last look. Did this mean I was allowed to stay…? But he’d turned to look out the window, his strong jaw set. I shivered.

His look was not a good sign for me. Would he request me be fully ousted out of the pack?

Despite my fears, I followed the maid to the dorms. “Each girl has her own room,” She told me curtly, “And own bathroom as well. Alpha Elijah wanted everyone to feel comfortable here.”

She stood in front of one of the rooms with the number ‘14’ carved into a brass plate. “This is your room,” she said, handing me a key with the same number on it. “Please take some time to get settled.”

I managed a smile. “Thank you.”

Once she was gone, I decided to take a quick look at the room and bathroom, which were a million times nicer than my cramped little apartment. The room was small but well-appointed, with a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a large four-poster bed piled high with decadent pillows, and a closet filled with clothes that were my size—and Elise’s.

The bathroom had a clawfoot tub, a walk-in shower, and a toilet with a bidet. I hadn’t lived in such luxury in a while, not since I’d lived at home.

Home…

Thoughts of that place drove me to think of how I had the potential to run into Ava at any moment here, and I couldn’t help but wrap my arms around myself to ward off a sudden chill.

If I stayed here, that sisterly reunion was bound to happen sooner or later. I hoped Elise was happy with her mate, and I’d certainly be giving her an earful once this was all over.",1,1746087294.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
