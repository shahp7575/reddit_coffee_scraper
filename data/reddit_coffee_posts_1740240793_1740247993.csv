How wrong I was. 

I’d bet my last coffee bean 90% of you are missing what I figured out. Its called the **reverse hype catalyst**. 

Here’s the breakdown. Hype isn’t what you pump out, it’s what players steal back. I used to hoard my Unity dungeon crawlers, eight months of tweaks, $1k ad barrage, and Id only land 50 downloads, $200 net on a $5 game. 

My inbox was a graveyard, wishlists at 30. Then my pal Riley, a dev with a janky survival mess, tossed a busted alpha on itch.io, “don’t play this crap.” Ten randos grabbed it, hacked it apart, rebuilt it on GitHub, spread it to 100 pals, saying “this is wild."" It hit 1.5k wishlists in three months. Launched to 5k downloads, $17k net, not a dime in ads spent. 

I’m over here, jaw dropped. Players don’t always wait for your hype, they hijack it. This is what I caught on to. My next game was a glitchy space shooter, which I “accidentally” leaked a broken build for on reddit pages, with a caption “oops, don’t touch.” 

Twenty pirates tore it open, “fix the thrusters."" My Discord flared to 200, people saying stuff like “this is nuts,” and they modded it, spread it to 500 peopel, and I hit 2k wishlists by beta. I nudged ‘em, “steal this, break it,” launched to 4k sales, $14k net. 

Another example. I made a platformer, and slipped a “cursed” demo to 15 testers, told them “it’s trash,” they messed with it, shared it with 150 people, “best glitches ever,” and it scaled to 1k wishlists, $7k net. 

Drop a broken toy six months early, 10-20 testers, call it “unplayable,” they’ll pirate it, fix it, evangelize it. 

I’ve seen $1k ads flop at 100 downloads, while reverse hype hit 2k wishlists free. 

Its crazy how players crave the forbidden, and not your polish.

This is just an example of how people truly want to be apart of your game's story. Promotions dont just start when your game is ready to launch, they start way before that.

I don't think I'll survive.,"​​The unspoken truth of every new job is that the spot you find yourself in once belonged to someone who fled or was taken out. Each office chair, an ergonomic headstone in a professional graveyard. 



But you never start a gig thinking of how it will end.



As I sat at my desk waiting to find out if I had reached my end at *Coastline Magazine*, all I thought about was my beginning.



In the six months since my graduation from journalism school, I received rigorous instruction on why I shouldn't have gone to journalism school. Fifty applications resulted in three interviews that resulted in zero job offers. 



Then *Coastline* called. 



*Coastline* was the magazine that got me interested in writing in the first place. When I was a kid, my dad would read me articles like they were bedtimes stories. I could rattle the names the staff writers off like they were superheroes. Peter Strum was my favorite. He'd spend months buried in research, unearthing incredible stories from the past, before laying out everything he learned in an article that read like a thriller. I can still remember the rush I'd get when my dad would return from the mailbox with a new issue, the smile on his face when he saw my reaction. Thinking back to those times is when I remember him the most clearly. 



The interview at *Coastline* went as the others had, so I wasn't hopeful. I sat in the uncomfortable chair across the HR lady as she scanned my resume, feeling like a kid who put on her mom's blazer to play work. She recited my greatest accomplishments back to me in a way that made me embarrassed by each and every one. 



""Editor of your college newspaper,"" she said. ""Very impressive."" My inadequacy was an old friend at that point.



I knew what came next. But instead of pivoting to a lament on the state of the industry, the HR lady asked about money. I was beside myself. Companies usually expect you to treat a salary like an incidental side effect of doing what you love—working for them. She, however, wanted to know how much I was expecting to make, like asking a starving person if they wanted fries with that. 



""I haven't given it much thought,"" I said. ""I guess I would say it's negotiable.""



""Well, let's negotiate.""



I sat for a long time, waiting for her to start. Then I said ""Forty"" with the hope that vomiting any number would bring me closer to leaving.



Her frown told me that I had aimed too high, so I decided that debasing myself was the only solution. ""But honestly, thirty would be more than generous.""



Her lacquered lips collapsed inward, disappearing as if to steel themselves before telling me to ""Get fucked.""



""Twenty seems fair,"" I said.

 

Her smile returned. We shook hands shortly after.



When I think back to my time at *Coastline Magazine*—all the late nights, demeaning tasks, the blood spilt, and lives lost—negotiating myself below the poverty line strikes me as an almost-charming detail.



\*\*\*



I should probably give you some context about *Coastline*. 



You see, a magazine was like a collection of articles that someone printed and mailed to you every month—sometimes even weekly.



It seems silly now, but there was a time when the words on those glossy pages mattered. That's what my dad thought, at least. He grew up dreaming of the world in a town that could only offer the drugstore magazine rack. Then he met mom, had me, and found whatever he was looking for, I guess. But in me, he saw opportunity and—unfortunately for both of us—hope. He knew that people could live adventurous lives, and the bylines in *Coastline* were proof of that. 



Then the world changed. Dad died, and the internet devoured most magazines. Losing him was made harder by the thought of saying goodbye to a thing we loved. That reckoning never came for *Coastline*, though. Through recessions and algorithm tweaks and pivots to video, its blend of center-left politics, celebrity profiles, and investigative longreads somehow endured as a last bastion of print media—unnaturally, some would joke. 



I, on the other hand, found ""unnaturally"" to be the case precisely.



My first day was the Monday following the interview. I had requested an additional week of time off before starting. When they asked why, the honest answer—""enjoying one last taste of freedom""—didn't seem prudent, so I said Monday would be great. 



The HR lady met me at the elevator at 10 and ushered me my desk. The newsroom for *Coastline Magazine* occupied the top floor of a converted textile mill. Old ductwork still hung from the ceiling, and if you looked closely, you could see scorch marks on the exposed brick wall from the fire that killed a couple dozen immigrants around the turn of the century. 



My desk sat at the very center of the open floor plan, one of a collection of six meekly divided workstations crammed onto two long tables. ""This is where our editorial assistants work,"" the HR lady said. ""Known affectionately around these parts as 'The Pit.' And these fine folks are the Pit Crew."" She signaled to the five hunched backs that surrounded us, each with the faint bluish glow of the computer screen just beyond it. Four turned to introduce themselves in a flurry of names I immediately forgot. 



But Kelsey's name I would remember. Settled deep into the seat next to mine, she didn't acknowledge me when I first arrived at my desk or after the HR lady left, instructing the rest of the Pit Crew to answer any questions I might have. As soon as she was gone, everyone returned to their work, and I was on my own.



Though the dull gray desktop smelled like it was freshly spritzed with green industrial cleaner, when I sat down I found that the drawers underneath it were still filled with the belongings from the previous tenant. There were breath mints, tampons, and a hoarded stack of Post-It pads. The personalized mug bearing the name Claire in friendly script held pens, their caps all nervously chewed.



The corner of a folded scrap of paper stuck out from beneath the mug's chunky base. I could lie to you and say that I thought the note might help identify the owner of the belongings, but I'm just nosy. And considering what I found on the paper, it served me right.



The creases across the yellowed page were deep, like it had been refolded again and again over years. There were only three lines of scribbled writing scrawled across its center. 



*I*

*Complete each task, for then sleep is earned.*



*II*

*Obey the foremen, for foremen shall you be.*



*III*

*Beware the Minder, for it knows not of mercy.*



As I stared at the lines, I knew I wanted nothing to do with whatever they meant. I turned to Kelsey. Her hard eyes were fixed on her screen. I couldn't decide whether they looked red because she had been crying or she was going for something with her makeup.



""Hi,"" I said tamping down the creeping dread with a smile. ""I didn't catch your name.""



""Kelsey."" There was no life in her voice. 



""Nice to meet you. I was just going through my desk. I think there's some stuff left from the girl who was here bef—"" Kelsey was out of her seat and gone before I could finish. 



With no one else to turn to, I emailed the HR lady about the unemptied drawer, doing my best to keep the email short and positive. I only apologized four times. 



It was Pit Crew tradition to get lunch together whenever someone new started. But Kelsey wasn't back by the time everyone was ready to go, and when someone mentioned that we had already wasted five minutes waiting, we left without her. Over an $18 salad, I fielded impersonal questions about what I hoped to do at *Coastline*. I said I wanted to be an editor, and the others exchanged looks. I didn't understand their meaning, but couldn't confuse their temperature as anything other than shady. 



Everyone got quiet when I asked what happened to Claire. ""She left,"" one of them said, almost defensive, after a long pause. I had figured, I told them, but I hoped to learn why, knowing that nothing engendered the new kid quite like shit talk. Once again, the Pit Crew clammed up. One of them broke the silence by saying we better get back. We'd been gone for 15 minutes.



Claire's drawer was empty when I got back.



That night I watched as my new co-workers left, one-by-one. Every ten minutes, I had to stand up and wave in the direction of a motion detector to turn the lights back on. But soon, without fail, I'd find myself once again submerged in darkness, the ghostly glow of my laptop screen the only light. I never shook the feeling that something was watching me in those moments.



At 9:30, there was still no sign of Kelsey. Her bag lay on her desk, exactly where it had been when she ran off. I was concerned—and also my mom had told me to not let anyone see you leave on your first day.



I did a lap around the empty office. Every light still burned, but not a soul remained. In the break room, I perused the ample snack cabinet and found Claire's left-behind belongings dumped out into the garbage bin, her chewed-up pen caps mixed in with the used K-Cups. The note, however, was missing.



Kelsey's Converse were sticking out from under one of the bathroom stalls when I poked my head inside the women's room. I entered the one next to hers and crouched beside our shared wall. Small sobs were the only sound that made it through. ""Kelsey,"" I said. ""It's Sam. Are you okay?"" 



I pressed my ear closer to the laminate divider. She sniffled. Her whispers were barely audible.



She told me I was going to die there. 



She said we all were. 



She was probably best friend I ever had.



\*\*\*



I was working at *Coastline* three whole days before someone screamed at me. There are four kinds of artificial sweeter, I learned. And apparently ingesting the wrong one is worth tearing into the new assistant—who, mind you, is a girl with three roommates and a shower curtain for a bedroom door. 



Whenever we could, Kelsey and I stole moments to talk. She was close with Claire, the girl who sat at my desk before me. But everything changed two weeks earlier, when Claire had spoken to one of the editors about a promotion. She returned to the Pit visibly shaken and refused to tell her friend any of what had transpired. Claire was gone a week later. Kelsey didn't know it was for good until they hired me.



I told her about the strange, scribbled note, but neither of us knew what to make of it. We decided the early scratchings of a YA novel side-project was most likely, since we both had our own. If Claire's request had been poorly received, that could account for her hasty exit, but not her complete ghosting of Kelsey. We theorized about explanations, compiled lists of the likeliest creeps on staff, and trolled the mastheads of other publications, praying to see her name appear.



But employment, like the inexorable march of time, flattens all things. Fears, passions, plans for retirement. Months slipped by without answers, the endless rhythm of work weeks pulling us through the end of the year like a riptide. There was too much else to worry about, deadlines to meet, and tantrums to manage. That was the nice thing about *Coastline*. Some new trouble always popped up to take the air out of the old.



Kelsey was a constant through it all. She could turn a day around with the precise timing of an eye roll. She knew where the editor-in-chief stored his special little snacks and how many we could take before someone noticed. She told me who to avoid and which happy hours specials we could take solace in when avoidance wasn't an option. 



The day we returned from New Years break—January 2nd—the Pit Crew were each meted out to senior writers like college-educated chattel to assist with long-term projects.



I got Peter Strum. 



In my six months at *Coastline*, I had yet to lay eyes on mine and Dad's favorite writer. He had apparently been off on assignment, but with the New Year was returning to the office to compile his research and start writing. I found his office door situated in the farthest corner of the floor, closed with a note stuck to it. ""Come on in,"" it read.



The space was more like a burrow than an office. The lamp on the desk illuminated only a fraction of the hundreds of books and antiquities crammed onto the shelves behind the desk. But without either Peter or further instructions, I was left with no choice but to look at all his stuff. Beneath a bejeweled dagger, a set of bagpipes, and an enormous conch sat a framed tintype photo. The four bearded men pictured stood side-by-side in a lush field. Their hollow cheeks were smeared with dirt. Their eyes were sunken and haunted. I couldn't look away.



""Now that's an interesting story,"" the voice behind me said. 



I jumped and said ""fuck"" too loudly. Peter stood in the doorway, an exact copy of the image I venerated in my mind for so long—pudgy, bespectacled, balding, a flat smile. Before I knew it, he was next to me, pointing at the image. 



Peter said that the guys were this reclusive group of Irish farmers from the late eighteen hundreds. When the Great Famine hit, they withdrew to the hills, completely cut ties with the other villages in the county. People said that these farmers had figured out a way to save their crops from the blight. No one was ever able to learn the truth. Villagers tried, but the farmers fiercely—sometimes violently—protected their crops and their secret. And so rumor, in the absence of fact, begot myth. There were whispers of an evil up in the hills. Something that granted good luck to all of the farmers' endeavors—for a price. Peter spent a lot of time looking into it, but the only lead he ever came across was two words: *dia nua*. 



It's Gaelic, he said. It means ""new god.""



A chill would have gone down my spine, but the office was already freezing. 



Once the blight disappeared and word of the farmers' success spread, they decided to capitalize on their infamy and publish an almanac, chronicling what they had learned—most of it anyway. Over the years, the almanac evolved, eventually becoming *Coastline Magazine*. 



Peter's eye flicked to the side to gauge my reaction to his kicker, but I didn't need to perform. The guy was good. I introduced myself and my fandom, trying my best not to scare him. He didn't seem to mind. 



We worked together nonstop for the next few weeks, me cataloging his notes and him laying out the loose structure of his eventual article. Sometimes we chatted. Others, he monologued about the state of the industry, how we were on the verge of losing something culturally that it was *Coastline*'s duty to sustain. I'd agree, and he'd admire my insight, before we returned to our quiet, focused work.



It was in those small moments when I felt most aware that I was actually at *Coastline*, doing work I was meant to, what my dad had dreamt for me.



After one late night in Peter's office, I returned to the Pit to find Kelsey still at her desk. She was the only assistant left, and the second I saw her, I knew she had been waiting for me. She said we needed to talk. When I didn't immediately know what we had to discuss, she got mad. Tom, one of the other assistants, hadn't been heard from since before the holiday, and when Kelsey asked his manager about it, she was accused of insubordination. 



""It's Claire all over again,"" she insisted. There *had* to be something going on here.



But I wasn't so quick to follow her down the rabbit hole. This industry is a tough one, I told her. No one gets into it to make money. And some people just aren't cut out for this kind of work. Tom could have just decided to move back home, and if I was being honest, that's probably what happened to Claire. 



Kelsey reacted as if I had just asked her to come in on a Saturday. I tried to assure her that that didn't have to happen to us, especially if we stuck together and Kelsey showed a little more hustle from time to time. But I only seemed to upset her more. She snatched up her bag and headed for the elevator before I could offer to put in a good word for her with Peter. 



Nothing could have kept me in the office after that—not even birthday cake in the breakroom. I waited just long enough for Kelsey to clear the building and subway, then got in the elevator alone. 



One floor down from *Coastline*, the car stopped, and the doors opened. No one was waiting to get on. I expected someone to hurriedly appear, having forgotten the one last email they needed to send and apologizing. But still, no one. I jabbed the close door button as if those ever worked, betraying how badly I wanted to leave. To be anywhere else but here—where I had let down my friend.



A *buzz* from the control panel startled me. Gears ground somewhere above. The elevator began to descend with the doors still open. A stumbled backward and cowered in the corner, as far from the gaping opening as I could get myself.



The floors passed slowly enough to glimpse the empty offices beneath *Coastline*, but too quickly to make an escape. A draft whipped through car with each new level. I tried to stay calm, reminding myself that the gusts were not pulling me closer and closer to the opening. It only felt that way.



A few floors from the lobby, I saw something that convinced me that fear had gotten the better of me. A figure sat cross-legged on the ground, facing the elevator in an almost childlike pose, lit dimly by the faint red light of a distant exit sign. The darkness and the descent didn't allow me much more detail than its ragged outline, a vague sense of its enormity, and the sudden smell of decay.



A chime rang out when the elevator reached the lobby. I still clung to the hand railing above me, my face buried in my shoulder. The security guard asked if I was alright and helped me up. He said he'd call maintenance in the morning. 



\*\*\*



I hardly slept that night. Kelsey plagued my thoughts, and my shower curtain door wouldn't close all the way because it had lost a ring. I spent the endless hours longing for sleep, yet dreading the day that slumber would whisk me toward even faster. At four, I gave up and showered. It felt like only moments passed before the subway car was hurdling past me, inches away, promising oblivion on either side of the platform's grooved yellow warning strip. 



The office was empty when I got in, and I lost myself in work for a few hours. Whenever a new set of footsteps approached, I braced myself for the slosh of her iced coffee and the crinkle of her take-out bagel bag. But when Kelsey finally did show up, I didn't notice until she was next to me. 



""Hey,"" she said, seeming as sleep deprived as I was. 



""Hi,"" I said. A weary, commiserative smile was all I could offer. 



I like to think she understood. 



The drumming started before we could say anything else. The steady beats were high and hollow, as if emanating from an ancient, tightly drawn skin. A voice over the intercom instructed the staff to gather in the conference room for an all-hands meeting. Terror filled Kelsey's eyes, and I applied baseless reassurances as we walked over together. The torrent of whispers around us was unintelligible beyond the fact that no one knew what was happening.



We assumed our positions, standing against the wall while senior staff sat in chairs, and waited for the editor-in-chief. He came in shortly thereafter, a politic expression on his face that was neither too sad nor joyful. His heavy watch thunked on the table when he sat down. 



The drumming continued as he spoke. He thanked us for coming on such short notice and said that he had some unfortunate news to share. The finance department had doubts about the forecast for the next fiscal year, so there would need to be cuts. He swore to us that these were his least favorite days, but were some of the most important for securing the future of *Coastline Magazine*. He thanked us again, asked us to keep up the hard work, and requested we return to our seats.



The HR lady was waiting for us in the center of the newsroom as we filed out. In a blunt voice, she ordered us all to resume work and to not—no matter what—look away from our screens. 



The room erupted in the sound of keyboards clacking. Through the din, I could hear the elevator rising to our floor, its motor straining loudly against an unusually heavy load. The happy *ding* of the elevator preceded the metallic slide of the opening door and the boom of enormous footfalls entering the office.



A putrid smell, like decaying produce, filled my nostrils. It grew stronger as the footsteps came closer. My eyes locked on my screen, I couldn't see whatever was behind me, but the dimming light told me it was tall. The HR lady explained that she had some questions about our recent performance and implored us to answer honestly. 



First, she wanted to know if Josh, directly behind me, had tried to start a union. When he said he had, I heard breaking bones muffle a scream. After Cindy, two seats over, admitted to printing her resume on a *Coastline* copier, her chair flew out of sight, and I never saw her again. Sara, immediately to my right, never stood a chance. She copped to requesting time off during the busy season. 



When the thing stopped behind me, a different voice spoke up. Peter cleared his throat and apologized for all of this nastiness. There was just one more question to answer. He wanted to know who I trusted more with the future of *Coastline Magazine*, myself or Kelsey. 



In the moment, it took everything I had to not look over to her. Now, I tremble at the thought of what I would have seen.



After it was all over, there was pizza in the conference room, and a few of the senior editors gathered around.



They said I had done well.



They said I showed initiative.

I used to work as a cashier at Panera bread which had a ton more buttons and questions on registers and complex. Also would have to cut breads, make coffee/lattes/smoothies, get pastries, stock up, clean tables/area, etc in between orders. Also Opening at Panera only giving you a hour to setup, was never enough even if you worked there awhile. However I didn’t feel rushed at all opening at dollar tree. It was pretty busy at dollar tree since it was a Saturday morning but I wasn’t stressed since the register is super easy. Getting Ballons between orders maybe was the hardest thing.I think this is a classic case of going from food to retail and how much better the conditions are. It is my first day so I know the worst may not have come yet. I also know not all dollar trees are the same of course and the managements are pretty nice at mine.

1ivoyhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1ivoyhz/china_eastern_lhrkix_an_honest_review/,China Eastern (LHR-KIX): an honest review,"For starters - we paid £460 return LHR-KIX with China Eastern (MU); an absolute bargain. MU is probably the cheapest way to travel between Europe and East Asia... you'll just need to manage your expectations :)

Booking - the third party website (yes I know potentially risky, but £200 saving per person forced my hand) didn't add our advanced passenger info (API - passport number, expiry etc) which meant we were unable to check in online so had to check in at the airport.

Check in - Easy. We arrived at 6:10pm for a 9pm flight. The traffic getting into Terminal 4 took longer than checking in AND clearing security. So we had ample time to charge devices, water in/out etc.

Plane - a 7yo Boeing 777 in a 3-4-3 config. We booked so early that I scored rear seats where the fuselage tapers and layout is 2-4-2. Seat selection is free with MU so make sure you do this at the time of booking, or log onto your booking on the MU website to select seats.  You'll get the standard pillow and blanket, though with the sun up most of the way the plane was plenty warm enough. 

Entertainment - a bit light, about 20 movies in English, no games, some music. It's 2025, people, plan ahead and download some stuff to your phone/tablet. Don't complain you were bored because you've seen all the movies on offer.

Food - Leaving London i went with the beef and rice. Perfectly fine. Bread rolls are served hot usually after the meal (knowing this, I kept some beef sauce and rice to dip) as they view it more like a dessert than an accompaniment. They even fed us hot fish, tofu, rice and mochi on the 90 min flight to Osaka. (I challenge you to find that service on a 90 min European flight)
Coming back from Shanghai it was a little more exotic but edible, tasted fine. Served after take off, mid flight and a sandwich/coffee just before landing.

Service - After all the negative reviews saying FAs are rude, I was expecting the worst. 
What I found was, they aren't rude; they're direct. 
Remember, you're on a Chinese carrier with native Chinese crew, English is their 2nd, 3rd or 4th language or they may not speak it at all.  They aren't going to bow and scrape, but they will feed you and keep you hydrated.
We were both asleep during breakfast service, so they left little stickers saying ""call for service"" on the seat back. When we woke, they came running with beef noodles which was brilliant. I've never had that on any other airline in a long time.

Transfer in Shanghai (PVG) -the flight arrived 20 mins early so our 2 hr transit time was more than ample. We went through a couple of screening points after taking the train to terminal 1, but hardly any waiting.
Even had time to sit at a cafe near the gate and get some brilliant plane spotting photos before our next flight to Osaka.
The return took a little longer but they prioritise connecting passengers with late flights/tighter connections. You'll get a sticker indicating which one you are so don't panic.


Things to remember:

Transfering at Shanghai - follow the yellow signs, you can't miss it. They will check your boarding pass and passports multiple times but clear security again and you're back at the gates.

You can't take power banks >160w on the plane,  security will confiscate them. Also, you're only allowed 2 X per person. They do not allow you to charge using the battery packs on the flight but economy has an international power point between the seats.

You've probably paid very little to be on a flight with MU - wind your neck in. The entitlement of some people on board are truly cringe. 


Final thoughts:

I think China Eastern and Chinese carriers in general have really upped their game in the last 5 years. They're trying to change the image of budget and untrustworthy to one of a middle carrier with decent service for a low price.

Would I fly them again?

Yes! 

The price was a steal, the checked baggage allowance ample (2x checked bags 23kg per person) and the service/transfer was efficient and easy. Considering the direct flights with BA, JL, NH are ~£1000 plus, this was well worth the extra couple of hours transfer time.

I would recommend China Eastern to others no worries :)

(but not like it’s something new),"***Yo, I felt like making a post about this randomly because this date has been getting interesting, specifically the last four chapters so I just want to give my thoughts about it and also give you my interpretation of things***

——————————————————————————————————

I’d like to start of with the fact that I **love** how we are getting more of Chiz’s insights on romance and what kind of relationship she wants with the person she loves. Whilst, she can be [dreamy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342342203476938833/IMG_6500.png?ex=67b94918&is=67b7f798&hm=f47a81f0b8db2dab36014fad0d581e818cf13953f6a09e9767f4cb7e4405cd25&), she falls more on the [practical side](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308610657532252262/1342387723507335198/IMG_6532.png?ex=67b9737d&is=67b821fd&hm=e1dc17c1c2f8aa2a1c3a5018cc8555768ff51c46a24710016f04d8fbe9e73011&) as we have seen this chapter. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anybody as this is how Chiz has always been since the very beginning.

We know for a fact from way before that Chiz is the type who [doesn’t prefer dating multiple guys](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342191028840435743/IMG_6493.png?ex=67b8bc4d&is=67b76acd&hm=4e3c7a7bc03c9be125bf745754851aab46a21226cd07b40c6ce08eb441bb522e&) to find the right one but instead wants to find that [one person](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342195332536336445/IMG_6495.webp?ex=67b8c050&is=67b76ed0&hm=c2556e1ddd1ed140dca967b3cb20566c8076ee61cc248890360dcca159d04eb9&) and be with him [forever](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1341938900305711186/IMG_6468.png?ex=67b87a3d&is=67b728bd&hm=8aed69cce01b2f3ff2a08eec829ee8ca4efabfeaa28b7898b4f68093245de1ac&). It’s also cute that [she talks like them dating is a given](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1341938910431023194/IMG_6471.png?ex=67b92300&is=67b7d180&hm=94b6ac9a4bb248ef4ca460af105045c1ff4a3d49e16c558cb5fa73a764073f8e&) or [talk like they have tied the knot already](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308610657532252262/1342359999388713053/IMG_6515.png?ex=67b959ab&is=67b8082b&hm=d8064a779adba99da564cd46b3639faa5b4c49a31061bf3a2b9312c41829476a&). She’s dreamy like that and that is why this date is very important to her because she is going to ask all the important questions that she wants to know Kaz’s answer to before she locks in on him, for the rest of her life.

——————

Well that aside, Chiz has been sort of projecting with the [Ruka issue](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1341921951110660116/IMG_6469.png?ex=67b7c1b4&is=67b67034&hm=33a3156a799fb24b72bc484ef73e32e664785ce3df7fe9ef64d226e6a7c312a6&) on this date, she was [hellbent](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1341922121978220676/IMG_6470.png?ex=67b7c1dd&is=67b6705d&hm=5ec72eefb8e25609a8f462a56cac4905a5b9842d454a7530a71d40788a29cf3f&) on making him admit that he’s been to Joypolis with Ruka. I made a small post about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KanojoOkarishimasu/s/AQzcFve6JN). 

She is really jealous of Ruka. She has always been jealous of Ruka since she pushed Kaz onto her. She’s regretted that decision ever since. She was jealous that Ruka slept at Kaz’s apartment, thinking they had done the deed. She was jealous that Ruka would call Kaz just “Kazuya” without honorifics. She was jealous he went on dates with her, especially when she spotted them on one and she got jealous even about the idea that Kaz may have been on a date with Ruka to Joypolis before he came with her, even though she’s been to Joypolis multiple times with her clients. The is the first of her **hypocrisy** moments I wanted to address.

——————

Moving on, I had sorta took a guess about the [cheating](https://www.reddit.com/r/KanojoOkarishimasu/s/6PNLQBdOTo) talk and I think I was half-right. Chiz did talk about kissing others as an actor but the context was different. Though I do think the issue I talked about in the comment linked is somewhere in the back of her mind. The reason being time management if she’s an actress, they won’t be able to spend much time together which often leaves cracks in a relationship.

This brings to my next point, if this guess of mine is on track, it kind of aligns with my long time theory that Chiz might quit acting *(which is exactly what her grandma, Sayuri, did after she fell for her grandpa, Katsuhito)* because what Chiz has really ***craved*** and ***yearned*** for, in her dark, sad and somewhat lonely life, is to have a present family as she never had one growing up. Her dad left them and her mom died shortly after. [She never had anyone showing up at her school and she decided not to tell Sayuri about her any of her PTA meetings because Chiz knew she was busy with other things](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342489409764724887/IMG_6501.png?ex=67b9d231&is=67b880b1&hm=1d98b7b8028b051dc17b11560cad7a0954c132ada02661c4ddad394fef58c042&). 

Now, this is NOT to say her grandparents didn’t pay attention to her because they raised her to the best of their abilities. Infact, Katsuhito’s personality had rubbed off on Chiz, so much so that she was first drawn to Kaz precisely because he was similar to Katsuhito, the only male figure in her life but perhaps for Chiz, deep down, her grandparents couldn’t really fill the hole her parents left. For a child, a mother and father are indispensable units and she grew up without both, [always seeing other children surrounded by theirs, as a happy family](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342491131417595945/IMG_6543.png?ex=67b9d3cc&is=67b8824c&hm=d59b11ae761a5111516e5c6b2dfd992c8df226117e43350827e82ee86ae5d8b1&). Seeing all the kids her age with their families, [Smolzuru walks away, all alone](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342491117353959485/IMG_6544.png?ex=67b9d3c8&is=67b88248&hm=6d0a51a93626774e0ee1b69e4cb9c34294bed27a8d3d6a91b1b14c6742285e04&) giving into her fate. Man, I felt so bad for smolzuru here.

Coming back to present, what current Chiz really desires is a big family (with Kaz obviously), maybe something like their kids playing around while the two enjoy morning coffee and as she said, going to their child’s PTA meetings together. I mean, why else would she go on her first actual date, with a guy she loves and ask [this serious ass question?](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308610657532252262/1342130269188128778/IMG_6489.png?ex=67b883b7&is=67b73237&hm=d461652e9c304f0e86111c739b0db327a36468eef5d5578935e6b5b1792aad92&) 

Are you wondering or confused about why do I think she will call quints on her acting career? Let’s be realistic here, there is no she can have the [type of family she years for](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342495738118012968/IMG_6516.png?ex=67b9d816&is=67b88696&hm=beaf6fac183090b14deda5cef0077bcaf3c3642def9cbe299324cfdda9ee09f4&) while managing it with a busy and always on the move job like acting, as acting takes a lot of time and I don’t mean just practicing but also performances and countless rehearsals as she is first and foremost a stage actress. She’d barely be able to give enough time to ~~her husband~~ Kaz and their kids if she is an active actress. We’ve already seen how busy her job keeps her in cohabitation arc, she is rarely home and Kaz is often left waiting for her. This is my argument on why her quitting acting is a possible route.

——————

Coming to the instance when Kaz asks what Chiz thinks counts as cheating. She starts with the whole “I won’t like if the person I loved kissed someone else” affirming [Kaz’s stance](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342526528801603665/IMG_6545.png?ex=67b9f4c3&is=67b8a343&hm=4abfa3785efd88d6579977c0e653fb9b43e14026a25f1f2b1c3c749bf647e56b&) about what **he** thinks is cheating but she has more to add after. She then continues with how if its two actors kissing for a scene or a sex-worker boning a client, then these acts do not count as cheating because it’s a job.

She then drops the the bomb on what she considers cheating- it’s when you have **feelings** for the person you are doing the acts with, like having feelings for the co-actor you are doing a kiss scene with or having feelings for the client you are having sex with. I mean, this was a very weird example to give but I guess it’s not that weird considering Chiz is inexperienced and doesn’t know much about romance herself. Basically, she meant to imply that she places *emotional cheating* over physical cheating. This is also why [she was glad](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308610657532252262/1342387791228833792/IMG_6538.png?ex=67ba1c4d&is=67b8cacd&hm=d2b5ede7b907993e46bfc62badff15892f9d9eb01ac9865008687bd64adbd622&) that Kaz tried breaking up with Ruka because he knew he loved Chiz and [she thanked him for his sincerity](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308610657532252262/1342387809692024843/IMG_6539.png?ex=67ba1c52&is=67b8cad2&hm=e238a7bd5c308539238f389380e953fb73a13b84d217378e57f79af0d0a26906&). BUT she is lying, she cares about physical cheating as much as she cares about emotional cheating. Why else do you think she was so restless and bothered about [if Kaz had sex with Ruka druing paradise](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342737455882829895/IMG_6554.png?ex=67bab934&is=67b967b4&hm=6bdf353efa0d86c4c593f975c1845345a6c69708f4459c491c2833171195d474&)? She was clearly [heartbroken about it](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342740334056177664/IMG_6555.png?ex=67babbe2&is=67b96a62&hm=6ea4af586ef9786be036a58e1e10ee72110388764cfad033cd22564c935925b3&) before aswell. She does care about physical cheating as much as she tries to bullshit Kaz into thinking she doesn’t. This is second of her hypocrite moments on this date.

——————

Back to the main point, Yes, Chiz is a big hypocrite, she has been one throughout the story, whether she is consciously or subconsciously one is up for debate. I personally have always thought that Chiz would rather be a hypocrite in some scenarios than expose herself to being vulnerable and getting hurt. Let’s take the latest chapter for example:

Starting with when she thinks back to [two of her most important moments](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342582327506636911/IMG_6547.png?ex=67ba28ba&is=67b8d73a&hm=4c7ecfdb41d5d0eb546e7487f1c733de77c7b9243780e58fa974ecb841529a15&) in the story. After this, she gets all philosophical about where a line between a [rental and real girlfriend](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308610657532252262/1342387710949593099/IMG_6531.png?ex=67ba1c3a&is=67b8caba&hm=ec7e795766676dda4465bf3e2b01baf3221b994c0504cc9f2d6fc54ed8050ee9&) should be drawn. She isn’t wrong for most part, her whole job is to act like someone’s girlfriend during the duration they rent her so where is the line actually drawn? She then she says that [she’s never fallen for a client](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308610657532252262/1342890481348116521/IMG_6557.png?ex=67bb47b8&is=67b9f638&hm=292e999d50e8b45330846b2bc936674e7b43897c05bcace3021e442165095aa8&). This is lie as we all know, while she’s done most of the stuff a girlfriend would with her clients, she says never actually been in love with them which is correct but also isn’t. She has been in love with one for the longest of times. I mean, we have a clear cut spread of [her denying that she’s in love with a client](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342892138890788924/IMG_6558.png?ex=67bb4943&is=67b9f7c3&hm=69702f49c3f62a366dcf5d2c1409c00875a3c5119a7456b11575996290eb79d2&) the fact that she had to deny it to no one but herself means she knew she was already in love with him and was actively denying, either consciously or subconsciously, all this time. This is the third time she seems like a hypocrite.

But that’s not all, I tried to look at this chapter’s cheating and rental-real gf conversation through another lens and this is what I see:

Chiz talked about how she thinks it’s only cheating when feelings are involved in a job. Wouldn’t it be the same for her job as a rental? What if she feels guilty that she’s cheating on her other clients with Kaz because she goes on dates with them while having feelings for him, who is *supposed* to be just another client? And this is why she says that she has never fallen for a client, because if she admits it, she’s admitting cheating on her clients which goes against her morals and standards for being a rental girlfriend. This could be the reason why Chiz said she would [quit being a rental girlfriend for her clients and not her boyfriend](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342912102636978296/IMG_6559.png?ex=67bb5bdb&is=67ba0a5b&hm=90abde7ccfdcb818cf7e76f25c3e8f17b9bd222602af3e46741c17b0b7764a79&) because she’d be cheating on them while she already has someone she is in love with. To be honest, her way of thinking is sometimes stupid and [she knows it](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1308610657532252262/1342387735444459540/IMG_6534.png?ex=67bac500&is=67b97380&hm=424a958314792c831e25c2ab832b397b16d88387c1354c1011dfb2cf25482ffa&).

——————

What’s next for this date? Well, taking [her notes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924723115626479658/1342913346441187448/IMG_6560.png?ex=67bb5d03&is=67ba0b83&hm=684106d45e77eb1239c2cbe0968b211dcf2c8e64bfc3a2544264d808be099c95&) into account, there’s the possibility of her talking how they’d split expenses, maybe Kaz brings up Umi ormaybe it’ll be something else entirely. Since the latest chapter didn’t end on a cliffhanger like the one before, I think the next chapter could mostly be chill and them just enjoying Joypolis.

Anyways that’s all for now. My yap session ends here.

Long story short, there is a lady who lives by me who inhereted a border collie a few years back and since we have moved in years ago, all the dog does is sit in the back yard and bark at everything and anything. She is well aware of it and says she uses ""multiple"" barking solutions but they don't work or she's full of it and just doesn't care.

To give you some more information, the dog is an outdoor backyard dog. It never goes for walks, never gets a ball thrown for it and never gets any attention. The only time we don't hear the dog is if it's super cold out. Unsure if she bring it inside or the dog sits in it's kennel outside but it does stop.

We have been pretty leanent for years on the matter regarding not phoning bylaw and not even complaining since the other people in the neighborhood have but it's gotten to the point where we can't have guests over, throw the ball to our dogs or even sit outside and watch the view drinking coffee without the dog sitting and barking for hours on end.

I went today and was finally able to speak politely to the lady about the dogs barking and the first words out of her mouth were "" well I'll just put the dog down, would you like that"".

I said no, you can just take care of it. Obviously we went back and forth and eventually she said we'll I'll just put the dog down and said she didn't have time for this, slammed the door in my face when I was trying to ask her why wouldn't she just give up the dog?

I could sense this person doesn't want the dog, sitting in her bathrobe, probably just got out of the tub, while her dog barked for 2 hours in the morning. It looks like she's going through a lot being a widow, so I really don't want to be that person but yeah, you get what I am trying to say.

I've contemplated getting the bylaw involved but I fear that this would push her to make a rational decision and put a perfectly healthy dog down who just needs attention and an owner who gives it attention. Would a vet even consider putting a dog down who is healthy, non aggressive and the only thing is an avoidable issue that is the owners fault?

I tried to call the SPCA but they are closed today till Monday. I would consider taking the dog but I have enough animals of my own.

Honestly I just think it's disgusting that instead of giving the dog up, or giving the dog some attention per day, she would result in saying she'd put the animal down.

But the desk and cases themselves too. The game takes a sudden dark turn; a spike in complication too. Pedophilia, necro, people I'd actively want to beat up with Rusty. ""Take your beating like a man"", indeed. 

Yet strangely it's also the most *cozy* part of the game. I can't explain it.

I live in a low-income, remote rural area in Latin America. I have a neighbor who has become my friend. He has access to social healthcare but lives in poverty. Last week, he had medical tests and was diagnosed with fatty liver disease, stage 3. He stopped drinking alcohol about 4 years ago but used to drink heavily. His diet is similar to most people in the neighborhood: rice, beans, plantains, eggs. Very little fish or chicken due to limited availability, but red meat and processed meats are common because they’re cheaper. There’s also lots of processed food, pastries with coffee, etc.

I want to help him. I know these medical conditions aren’t easy, but based on what I’ve shared, could you advise me on what to do? At the hospital, they only told him to “improve his diet” but nothing else happened. Any help would be appreciated!

TL;DR: Friend diagnosed with stage 3 fatty liver disease in a poor rural area with limited diet options. Hospital only suggested improving diet, no specifics. How can I help him?",2,1740247394.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,0,1.0,False

My concern is I have POTs syndrome (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), it causes me to pass out regularly (imagine a fainting goat- that’s basically me/ what it’s like lol). With this sometimes I have issues standing in certain spots prolonging. I’m fine when walking around it’s just with standing still or when I get hot etc bc when I stand in one spot my bl00d pools and not enough bl00d reaches my brain. I would occasionally need to sit down. I’m wondering if they’re okay with offering accommodations like that? I have piercings and dyed hair so in my area it’s hard to get job that is acceptant of such which made me think I should I should apply here? 

My other question/ concern is I’ve never heard anything about their training which makes me worry about offering people advice because I don’t want to say the wrong thing or recommend the wrong stuff and make their hair fall out. Bleach is my main concern. Soo I was also wondering if they’re actually go through all of that in training so I can actually properly advise customers (and not get sued for their hair falling out lol). 

I’m also a college student so with both the health issue and me being in school I’m wondering what schedules they offer in terms of how long the shifts are, what they will and will not hire for etc etc. I mainly would need to be part time

1ivos1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1ivos1i/bubble_backpacks/,Bubble backpacks?,"Not a noob: I've lived my whole life (more years than I'd like to admit) with a cat or two in the household. We lost our best cat a couple years back, and just adopted a 2 year old tabby who came from a cat hoarder household (may have seen some neglect and/or abuse). 

She's clearly well-trained: litter box perfect, knows that her toys are the ones in the basket (and one rubber duck on my desk that she seems to love.) She's sweet, but not the kind of cuddly lapcat sweet we had hoped for in our retirement years. She is likely our last cat. So we're trying to make it work. 

She's been with us two months, and is still unpredictably skittish. Super afraid of any change from our quiet routine: for example, last night she spent a record two minutes on my partner's lap (cat did NOT instigate), so we started to think that maybe she's finally settling in. Then this morning was a half hour of panicked zoomies. And she's acting scared of us again. Pretty much the same pattern for the last month. 

At any rate, she spends a lot of her time frequenting our many windows. (sSide thought: she'd be a great barn cat!) If she weren't so skittish and unpredictable, we'd love to be able to let her out. But between that and bird flu, it's not a good idea. 

As noted, we're trying to make this work. We get together weekly with a group of friends for a walk/run/chase kidlets followed by coffee and shared baked goodies. I think she might enjoy the change of scenery (birbs! bunnies!), but because there are many dogs on the trails, I don't think a harness would work well. So I'm wondering about those bubble backpacks.

I hope this post can bring comfort to anyone going through the same. 

So in October of 2024, I met this guy. We clicked the first time we met and very soon he asked me out for the first time. We had gone on two dates before he asked me to be his girlfriend and I naturally accepted, because I really liked this guy. He was my first boyfriend. The first few weeks were amazing; we talked every day and shared everything about our lives. The more we talked, the more we realized how much we had in common. We share the same core values and want the same things for our futures. 

The only problem was the distance. It isn't a huge distance, only 3 hours by train, but still large enough that we could only see each other on Saturdays. But as you know, life often gets in the way and there were times when we couldn't see each other and we ended up seeing each other once, maybe twice a month. Until Christmas, it wasn't such a huge problem since we talked every day and I didn't feel the distance. But after Christmas and New Year's, we started to talk less. We still talked every day or almost every day, but it was noticeably less than before since we were both increasingly busy with school and family. There was also another problem that was starting to become detrimental to the relationship. My ex wanted to get a job, which would mean that he'd have to work on Saturdays. Our Saturdays. 

Up until the very end, we loved each other. I know that he loved me. But due to the distance and some other, personal problems, the relationship was failing. I knew that it would fail eventually, but he promised that breaking up wasn't an option then, and I wholeheartedly believed him. Two weeks ago, on February 8th, we met again. We spent the first few hours talking as usual while drinking coffee in the sun. We were both having a nice time. But then we started to talk about the lack of conversation we were having and how we could fix it. We sat on a bench, where we usually liked to sit and he cuddled me. I was hopeful that everything would be just fine. But then he told me about his friend who just ended his long-distance relationship and was asking if it was a sign. I understood in which direction this was going so I looked him in the eyes and asked if he was breaking up with him. At that point, he was still unsure, but he didn't know what else could be done to escape the inevitable. He thought that it would be less painful for the both of us if we broke up then, than if we waited. 

Although I'm sure that breaking up after 4 months isn't nearly as painful as breaking up after a longer amount of time, it still hurts a lot, especially knowing that we now won't get to do some things that we wanted to. Another thing that bothers me about this is that I can't even convince myself that he was a jerk and that I'm better off without him because he was seriously a great boyfriend. While he was breaking up with me, he told me everything he thought about me, which were things that seriously changed how I view myself now (in a good way), because I realized that someone whom I truly admired admires **me.** It did wonders for my self-esteem, and I'll always be grateful for the love and respect he has shown me throughout our relationship, especially in those last moments. I can't judge him for what he did. Life has been cruel to him and he was only protecting himself from getting hurt. It's just hurting me right now. 

It was important for both of us to remain on friendly terms since we're both a part of the same scholarship program and we'll both be seeing each other on seminars. He even believes that we can start over someday when the circumstances change, but I don't want to hope for something only to get disappointed again. I just want this pain to end so that I can move on. I want to feel better again.

My partner expects me to lay in bed for hours because he doesn’t like “waking up alone”,"Does anyone else think this is an insanely unreasonable expectation? My partner expects me to lay in bed for hours because he doesn’t like “waking up alone.”
Currently we are both not working so we have mornings (and days) together. 
Since I’ve been on leave he started saying he doesn’t like waking up alone and wondering where I am when he wakes up. Our apartment is pretty small so I could really only be in the kitchen, living room, or bathroom honestly. It’s not like I just leave and am unreachable for the day or something. 
I am an early riser naturally and he is not and is notoriously hard to wake up. I don’t think it’s my responsibility to rub his back so he can wake up nicely but he doesn’t think this is too much to ask. 

He is also adamant about me being there when he wakes up. Calling me back into the bed is not good enough because the bad feeling of waking up alone has already happened so in his mind it is too late then.  
I have told him several times that this expectation is unrealistic and if I wake up at 6:30 and he sleeps till 11:30 that is 4 hours of my day wasted. Also, I want coffee, I want breakfast, wtf. Is this not normal? 

This morning I woke up at 7:30, laid in bed till 8:15 then got up to feed the cat and dog and started cleaning up around the house a bit. At 9:30 he starts making noise and I go in and lay with him and he is once again upset that he woke up alone. 
Then he asked what my plan for the day was and I said, “clean the house and go get groceries to cook something.” He then got upset at this and said I just plan every day and he can’t make any plans because I am selfish and don’t wait for him so we can plan together. I told him my “plan” was just tasks and he can add whatever he wants us to do. I tried to get him to tell me what an ideal day in his mind was and what a perfect girlfriend would do but he refused to give me any examples and just kept saying I don’t care about him. 

Basically it led to a big argument and I told him we are just not compatible and I will never meet his expectations.

Well we are currently on said trip right now. A few things were not as promised from the room booking. Studio apartment layout with 2 rooms for 4 people….

## Design ⁢and Comfort: A Tailored Fit

the frist, and often most immediate, difference you'll notice is the design. The⁤ AirPods Pro 2 maintain Apple's‌ signature minimalist aesthetic. They're small, lightweight, and incredibly discreet, fitting snugly within your ear. This makes them ideal for active use and prolonged wear. The included ear tips in⁣ various sizes ensure a pleasant⁣ and secure fit for ⁤a ⁤wide range of ear shapes. Many appreciate the AirPods ​Pro 2 comfort reddit discussions,which often highlight their ease ​of use during workouts and travel.

The Sennheiser Momentum 4, on the other hand, opts for a more‍ customary over-ear headphone design. This allows for ​larger drivers and potentially better sound isolation through physical means. The plush earcups and ​padded headband provide a comfortable listening experience,⁢ especially for extended periods. However, their larger⁣ size makes​ them less portable and perhaps ‍less suitable for intense physical activity. the Sennheiser Momentum 4 comfort reddit sentiment frequently praises their luxurious ​feel for home listening, but some find them bulky for on-the-go use.

Ultimately, ⁣the ""best"" design is subjective​ and depends on your personal preferences and‌ usage scenarios. If portability and discretion are paramount, the⁤ AirPods Pro ⁤2 are the clear winner. If you prioritize maximum comfort ‌for long listening sessions and ‌don't mind the bulk, the sennheiser Momentum 4 is likely the better choice.

**Trip Overview (Mid February)-** 

1. Tokyo - 4 nights
2. Hakone - 1 night
3. Kyoto - 3 nights
4. Sapporo - 1 night
5. Rusutsu - 3 nights

**Overall Reflections -**   
Summary of Tokyo

1. Would recommend:
   1.  [かめや 新宿店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UMZsG4ax56Z31GZo8) (Soba noodles with vegetable tempura) - easily top of the list. It checks off everything we had in mind about Japan. It also opens 24 / 6 so you can go if you wake up at 3am
   2. Plan your trip loosely and by areas, if possible - Tokyo is so much more spread out than we expected and it is easily 30 mins to get to the next place. We had a list of restaurants that we wanted to go and ended up going to very few of them because better choices close by kept showing up
   3. TeamLab Planet - Neither of us typically likes art exhibits but we loved it (we budgeted 1.5 hours but could easily spend another hour + there). We got the 9am ticket and would recommend go early in the morning
   4. Go to tourist attractions early (6-8am) - Senso-ji was completely ruined for us because of the crowd. However, we went to Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine at 7am, it was such a magical experience
   5. Plan extra time if it is commute time - we took a subway away from the city center \~8am thinking it would be “reverse commute”. We were wrong… the train was packed
   6. Luggage forwarding - our hotel told us it would be up to a week to forward our bag from Tokyo to Hokkaido, which would mess up our trip plan. We then went to Yomato directly and our luggage arrived in 2 days. The last part of our trip was skiing and being able to send our big check in luggage directly to the ski resort was extremely helpful. It cost \~3k JPY and it was worth every penny
   7. For us, taking a taxi to the hotel after a \~15 hour flight was worth it than Subway or Airport bus
   8. 7/11 green smoothies - we typically eat a lot of vegetables and we somehow just couldn’t get enough vegetables. Luckily, we found the 300 JPY 7/11 green smoothies. We had at least one a day for the rest of our trip
2.  Would do differently:
   1. Visit Japan form - we filled out the paper form. We would recommend filling out the web form where you can get a QR code, which can be used for tax free shopping in Tokyo (not sure if you would still need to carry your passport if you have the QR code)
   2. Look into subway passes - it might actually save money. We ended up taking more subway rides than we expected because our legs were so tired
   3. Tokyo has so many options, especially for food and drinks, do not do too much research during the trip, and instead enjoy wandering around sometimes. Both of us are recovering from Google Map, Reddit and travel blogs fatigue
   4. Sumo wrestling - buy food at the sumo wrestling place and eat there. You don’t need to go at the very beginning and instead you can go whenever during the half day event

Summary for Tokyo -> Hakone -> Kyoto -> Sapporo - >Rusutsu

* Would Recommend:
   * Owakudani - it was the highlight of the trip (for me). The guided hiking trail is a MUST and they have English explanations on the website for you to follow through
   * Break off the trip between Tokyo and Kyoto - it was nice for us to have a change of scenery between the two big cities
   * Stay in a Ryokan - it was on my bucket list and I would do it again
   * Ski in a smaller resort - we were so glad we didn’t go to Niseko. Rusutsu was much smaller but the condition and the short lines were amazing
* Would do differently:
   * Owakudani - Take the ropeway for one way and bus for the other leg of the round trip. The bus is faster. The Hokonetozan, cable car and ropeway all have their schedules so if they don’t line up, it would take a while. You need to do it once just to experience it and take the bus as it would be faster and cheaper
   * Owakudani / Hakone / Kyoto - Instead of storing luggage in the hotel, store it in the coin lockers in Hakone Yumato or Gora. There were plenty of coin lockers available if you go early and you wouldn’t have to go out of your way to retrieve your luggages

**Trip Details -** 

1. Day 1
   1. Arrived in Tokyo Haneda airport \~5am
   2. Took a taxi to our hotel in Akasaka-Mitsuke
   3. Went to Shinjuku and explored the area, including Omoide Yokocho around 7am
      1. Most of the shops were closed but we found this Tempura soba noodles place ([かめや 新宿店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UMZsG4ax56Z31GZo8)) that we went back 4 times during our 4-day stay in Tokyo. This place opens 24 / 6 (closed on Sundays, but opens at 12am on Mondays). It checked off all the boxes of “the Japanese food experience” for us
      2. Coffee - [swamp coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aL4uCJtGX9v8d5ps5) \- highly recommend
      3. Meiji Jingu \~10am
   4. Explored Shibuya
      1. Explored Shibuya area (including Harajuku) and checked off the box for Shibuya Scramble Crossing
   5. Went back to Shinjuku
      1. Dinner at [Shinjuku Unatetsu Hanare](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TVXkAcDD8DxQqvUK8). This was probably one of the more expensive meals (\~JPY10k) we had in Tokyo and the eel was good and fresh.They killed live eels and filet them right in front of you
      2. Spent the rest of the night wandering around Shinjuku (Golden Gai, Kabukicho) so we didn’t go to bed too early
2. Day 2
   1. Coffee - [Chumon-Baisen MAMETORA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rE4jqS8B3XyakZkf8) \- would recommend
   2. Sumo wrestling - there aren’t any sumo wrestling matches in even months but we got lucky to see a special event
      1. The ticket says it started at 11am but it really was a noon-5pm event. We realized when we were that people actually buy and eat their lunch there
   3. Japanese Sword Museum
      1. It is free to access and you only need to pay if you decide to go to a special floor that displays preserved swords. If you are only interested in sword 101, no need to pay for it
   4. Walked along the river and went to Asakusa
      1. Got sushi at a local sushi spot
   5. Walked to the Kappabashi (the kitchen street) to buy knives and explore all the cool kitchen stores
   6. Stopped by Ginza on our way back to get ramen for dinner (H[ashigo Ginza Hon-ten](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2rsdrki2Yt1szH2E9))
      1. Our original plan was to go to Ginza Kagari - Soba but the line was crazy
3. Day 3 - 2/10
   1. Coffee - [TABI TO COFFEE Asakusa ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q3GbQXBY4uyDTQ2V9)\- would recommend
   2. Senso-ji temple and Akakusa areas
      1. We got here after 9am and it was already very crowded. We did a VoiceMap self-guided audio tour. Between the crowd and someone constantly talking to us through the audio tour, we were quite annoyed. But overall we would recommend, but just go as early as possible
   3. Then we went back to  Kappabashi to buy knives (brought our passport this time and saved 10%)
   4. On our way back, we decided to stop by the Tokyo station to buy a bottle of bourbon that they don’t sell in the US as a gift. This then became a mindblowing experience of the number, the size and the connection of the shopping malls here. It was extremely hard to navigate and we wished we had more time to just stroll through all the malls
   5. Then we went to bed at 4pm… after walking more than 100k steps for the past 3 days
4. Day 4 - 2/11- tokyo 
   1. We decided to spend the day taking it easy. It also happened to be the National Foundations Day so we went to Meiji Jingu to see the parade
      1. Coffee at [ABOUT LIFE COFFEE BREWERS](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MawyMQGdL8B2TCyG8) \- would recommend
   2. Then we went shopping in Shibuya and just people watched
      1. Checked out the MEGA Don Quijote and it was extremely overwhelming
   3. Tried belt sushi at Mawashizushi Katsu Seibu Shibuya Store. We were debating between Sushi-ro and something slightly nicer. We were glad that we tried something slightly nicer (still only JPY 4k for 2 people) because we are more particular about food, especially raw fish. Living in New York, I would disagree with the statement that Sushi-ro is better than most sushi places because the nicer belt sushi wasn’t as good as the everyday sushi places near where we live in New York
   4. Dinner with a friend who works in Tokyo
      1. We got a private room at [Satsuma Ushinokura (Akasaka) t](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a3AZkmjm3qu1GJ8g6)o try Japanese yakiniku and it was really good.
5. Day 5
   1. 9:00AM TeamLabs Planet
      1. Neither of us is the “arty” type but we really enjoyed TeamLabs Planet
   2. Travelled to Hakone (Odakyu Railway because it leaves from Shinkuju and we could get the soba noodles one last time)
   3. Stayed in a Ryokan, walking distance from Hakone-Yumoto
      1. We booked a room with an “half-open air onsen” and thought it would be a small onsen for the two of us in our room. Upon arrival, we realized that it was a wooden bathtub, fit one person, half-open air, can be filled with natural hot spring water. It was a funny experience because the marketing wasn’t inaccurate and we just had a different understanding of “onsen”
      2. Luckily, our hotel also offered three private onsens and cost JPY 2,200 for an hour. We also tried the public onsen separated by gender in the hotel early in the morning (\~6:30am) and it was very clean and relaxing
      3. We had Kaseiki dinner and hotel breakfast wearing hotel provided Yukuta (a lounge wear). It wasn’t the best food but it was just interesting to see most guests wearing Yukuta and slippers at the dining room
6. Day 6
   1. Owakudani (from Hakone-Yumoto)
      1. It was quite a trip to get there and come back
      2. We got to Owakudani early and were pretty much the first ones there after the park opened. The experience was amazing because it was not crowded at all and the weather was beautiful
      3. Guided walking trail - It was the best decision we made to do the walking trail. It required advance reservations (we made our reservations the day before and it was fully booked the morning off). It cost JPY 800 but they walked you through the shelters and the areas they cook the black onsen eggs. The website would say that it is Japanse speaking only but there are QR codes to give you the English explanations to follow through
   2. Took Shinkansen from Odawara to Kyoto
      1. Took Hakonetozan to Odawara to catch the Shinkansen train
      2. We booked our tickets on our way to Odawara. It was during the week and a normal working day. There were plenty of tickets
      3. Train options:
   3. Arrived at Kyoto
      1. We took a taxi from the Kyoto station to our hotel. I also download the taxi App (“Go”) as a back up plan. They offered foreign speaking taxis at the train station
      2. Our hotel was right by the Nishiki market. It looked like the Time Square when we first got there but we soon realized that there were so many good, authentic food and drink places if you walk 5 mins away from it
      3. Drinks at Rocking Chair - This was recommended by a reddit user. It was 80% foreigners but the drinks were GOOD
      4. We wanted to experience the “wandering around the neighborhood, randomly walking into a restaurant and it was the best food ever” feeling so just walked around. We have to admit, it wasn’t easy because both of us are value maximizers. We did luckily found [和鉄板 ぞろんぱ 柳馬場六角店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/148ibdKtrQ4nkpBx9), and it was so delicious. It was a izakaya place with ingredients directly from the farm
7. Day 7
   1. Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine
      1. We got there before 7am and had the best experience. It was an amazing hike with barely anyone there
      2. If we get to do it again, we would get a self guided audio tour
   2. Went to Gion via electric bike
      1. The electric bike was awesome to go from Fushimi to Gion as public transportation options were limited and we don’t like taking taxis overall
      2. Coffee at [fuku coffee roastery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5dA9DS74avvZy8R47) \- you get to smell the beans and pick based on the smells. Would recommend
      3. Lunch at Izuyu Sushi to try Kyoto style sushi - it wasn’t the best food we have had but it was interesting to try Kyoto style sushi.
      4. Walking around touristy part of Higashiyama (near Tea Ceremony Camellia FLOWER) was a nightmare - it was extremely crowded and full of people obsessed with taking photos
      5. Tea ceremony Camellia FLOWER - we were pretty “temple-d out” at this point and tired of crowds. This was honestly a break and gave us a peace of mind. It was a touristy activity but the experience felt authentic. We would 100% recommend it.
   3. Dinner at Kokodenome - recommended by a reddit user too. The atmosphere was young and funky. The food was more tailored to younger eaters. They do pour extremely good beer, which was also advertised on their menu.
8. Day 8
   1. 7am ramen at Ichiran - ramen was good and good experience. There was a drunk guy passed out next to his empty ramen bowl, which was funny
   2. Coffee at [WEEKENDERS COFFEE TOMINOKOJI ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VNU1hUcBHyBBBSnx7)\- very good coffee
   3. Nijo-jo castle - we went right when it opened. It didn’t seem to be crowded when we left around 10:30am. We didn’t know about the English tour and would consider it next time. We just followed along the signs and had a great experience. 
   4. Lunch at [Honke Owariya Main Branch ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7VFMEDCeMe7QUJ9s9)\- the oldest soba noodles place. The vibe was old school and the food was decent
9. Day 9 - 2/16
   1. Travelled to Osaka Itami airport through the Airport Limousine bus - seats are first come first serve. Even if you get tickets ahead of time, it doesn’t mean that you would get a seat. We got on the earliest bus (\~5:40am) and we only got the seats in the corridor
   2. Arrived at New Chitose airport and travelled to Sapporo via the Rapid train. It took about 40 mins
   3. Soup curry lunch at [Curry Soul Destroyer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MyUMQTgnzffrNUqW7) \- it was good and felt very authentic. Most of the eaters there were solo male eaters, which I found interesting. We tried to go to Sama, which is highy recommended on Reddit but there was already a line out the door around noon
   4. Explored Daimaru (an underground mall) for sweets and other snacks - honestly never thought I would go to a mall while on a trip…but the mall food in Japan is very good
      1. We had the freshet Daifuku on B1 floor of Tokyo Department Store Sapporo Store - it was freshly made at the store and only came out at a certain time during the day. I can’t remember the day but it was on your right hand side if you enter directly into the B1 floor from the street (Kita-5-Jo-Teine-dori Ave)
10. Day 10
   1. Travelled from Sapporo to Rusutsu via a free [shuttle bus](https://rusutsu.com/en/access-shuttle-bus-sapporo/) \- it was free and required advance reservations
   2. Snowmobile at Rusutsu
11. Day 11-13
   1. Skied for 3 days
   2. We decided to cook simple dinner meals because we were tired of eating out. Our hotel room had a small kitchen
   3. We ate out one night and went to a “highly recommended” place by the hotel staff. It felt overpriced for the quality of the food. For example, eel over omelett came out of a package and it cost 7,800 JPY
   4. We did checked out a couple of local spots during the day and would recommend the following places (they are actually all at the same roadside station)
      1. Local produce at [野菜直売所 道の駅230ルスツ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mLkZzDVBxCQwe4rn7)
      2. Ice cream and crepe at [クレープ このみ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S3oHvtFVdzmhWuqS6)
      3. Pizza at [天然酵母熟成ルスツ ピザドゥ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WuRk26VPzdKy6ESZ8)

. 

1. Violating Ethical Boundaries from the Start

Elements of a Personal Relationship: They went for coffee with you and accepted gifts, which is ethically questionable. The relationship between a therapist and a client should be strictly professional.

Conflicting Messages: They expressed personal liking towards you and even stated that you would be suitable as their spouse. This is entirely unprofessional and blurs the boundaries between therapist and client.

2. Abuse of Professional Power

Exploitation of a Vulnerable Situation: You were in a vulnerable state due to a court case and past traumas. The therapist should have maintained firm boundaries and provided a safe space to process these matters, rather than bringing their own emotions into it.

Mishandling Transference: When a client experiences transference toward a therapist, the professional should help the client understand it safely. Instead, they took advantage of the situation, initially enjoying your feelings and later blaming you for them.

3. Dismissal, Humiliation, and Emotional Manipulation

Minimizing Trauma: They laughed at your traumas and told you to keep quiet about your feelings. This directly contradicts ethical principles in therapy.

Emotional Manipulation: They promised to call in a crisis but did not follow through, later justifying it by saying they wanted to ""teach"" you not to rely on them. This is cruel abuse of power, not therapeutic support.

Disrespecting Your Faith: They dismissed your belief in God as wishful thinking, which is disrespectful and outside the therapist’s professional role.

4. Controlling Therapy and Preventing Its Termination

Calling Against Your Will: When you attempted to end therapy, they called you against your request and even laughed, referring to your suicidal thoughts. This is reckless and dangerous behavior, as it can worsen a client’s distress and make them feel powerless over their own care.

Blaming Communication: They continuously accused you of lacking boundaries and ""overloading"" them with issues, despite it being their professional duty to establish and maintain healthy boundaries from the beginning.

5. Unethical Behavior at the End of the Therapy Relationship

Sending a Goodbye Message Against Your Request: When you asked them not to contact you, they did so anyway and used it to make you feel guilty. This demonstrates a lack of respect for your boundaries.

Avoiding Responsibility: When you questioned their actions, they did not respond. This suggests they were unwilling to face their own unethical conduct.

I don’t do much in the evenings, and I could use the extra cash. 

“Get Nadia to show you round the play centre before you leave today,” said Craig.

Nadia’s my coworker. The soft play centre is her patch. Most jobs at the Leisure centre take two, maybe three hours at most, but Nadia rarely got away before ten each night. 

My tongue was already in knots. “Sorry–would it be ok if I got here for, like, 5pm?”

He gave a smiling nod. “Nadia doesn’t usually start the clean ‘til six.”

I thanked him again. Good manners make up for all the times I’d taken his instructions way too literally. Craig’s been much more tolerant with me than other bosses. His slow, plodding steps and thick Blackpool accent made it hard to feel afraid of him.

“See how you like it,”  he fell in step beside me as I continued down the corridor to find my colleague. I thought he was making a joke, and tried a laugh. “I’m probably a bit old for soft play.”

He laughed. “No, I meant the cleaning shift.”

“Oh–of course.”

“It’s a very different job from cleaning the gym. But if you like it, you could maybe take these hours on for good.”

“Is Nadia leaving?” 

Craig gave a slow shrug. “She’s off on holiday this week… we’ll see what happens after that. Thanks, sweetheart.”

 I liked Nadia. We didn’t know each other that well, but I’d only ever had kindly smiles from her and she never seemed annoyed when I asked for help. What’s more, I always thought that she kind of looked like Mary from Silent Hill (!) Eventually I found her in the cleaning cupboard, twirling her earphones round her finger. 

“Sorry.” 

At the sound of my voice, she let out a stifled gasp. 

I smiled an apology. “I should have knocked.”


She stared at me, wide-eyed, for a second or so, waiting for her brain to process whose face she was looking at. “Oh,” she laid her hand on my arm. “Sorry, honey, sorry.”

“N-no worries. Um–Craig says you’re off, tomorrow?”

She nodded. “I’m c-covering your shifts this week,” I continued, “...just wondered if you had a second to show me how you clean the soft play sometime this morning?”

Nadia looked at me in silence for a minute. It made me feel a little awkward. Had I offended her? “Craig asked you to cover me?” 

“Yeah,” I smiled. Her eyes grew wider. I felt myself wilt. I guessed she thought I wasn’t competent (but was too nice to admit it.)

“Uh-huh.” She shook her head, and stuck her phone back in her pocket, leaving the earphones trailing. Ushering me out, she smiled hard. “I start upstairs.”

The experience of that first walk-around was one of nostalgia. The faded walls, the gaudy illustrations of cartoon animals, and the playful shadows cast by snaking slides and sprawling ball pits were precisely as I remembered them. The sickly smell of birthday cake and vomit inspired in me a wave of memories. As we plodded round the parent’s cafe, I could almost see Mum sipping tea at the corner table, like some disconsolate prisoner. I felt my brother’s spirit running to the rope swing that dangled barely half a foot from the cushioned floor. Even the squeak of Nadia’s trainers against the spongy green floor was tinged with childhood. I remembered every lonely moment, playing by myself at the back while the other kids giggled behind me. 

“I don’t mop everyday,” Nadia’s voice brought me back from reverie. 

“Oh. That’s good.”

“Only once or twice a week. Or when someone’s spilled juice.”

I was glad to hear it. At the back of the soft play, the dimly lit corridors wound left and right without any discernible pattern. We passed a solitary waste bin. Shaped like an anthropomorphic beetle, its sordid smile betrayed ten years’ grime. “We…change the bins too, right?” I asked, when the silence had lasted a little too long between us.

“If you want,” Nadia turned to me. “We’re not technically meant to start clean-down until 6pm. But I try and sneak in here at 5. That way I’m not here after dark.”

“I imagine it’s a bit spooky after dark, back here–”

I meant it as a joke, but Nadia took me seriously. “You don’t have to stay the whole three hours, you know.”

Her heavy tone caught me off guard. But as I studied her face, I saw her features bore a strange, almost protective quality. “Just make sure you don’t hang around if you don’t need to. You…it doesn’t take a whole three hours. And if you feel weird about being here alone, just lock up and get out. Ok?”

I was touched. “Thanks.”

She held my gaze. It was as though she wanted me to say something more, but I couldn’t think of anything to say that wouldn’t sound contrived. “Still,” she added, at last. “Don’t put yourself at risk. It’s not worth it.”

My first shift was that night. I got to the sports centre just before 5 and got a redbull from the vending machine. Before I went any further, I pulled my earphones carefully over my head. The long, strip-lit corridor has that hard, vinyl flooring that makes footsteps offensively loud. I pattered past the disused lockers and the old squash courts, until I reached the door emblazoned:

TunnelWig Play Centre

I swiped my card and opened the door. As it was nearly closing, a handful of kids were visible through the rope mesh that separated the play centre from the parents’ cafe. A tired looking young woman called her child from one of the tables as the supervisor appeared behind the counter. She was tall and blonde; maybe 28, or 29 years old, and very pretty. “Hey,” she flashed me a sunny smile. 

“Hello,” I mumbled. “Am…I too early to get started?”

“Where’s Nadia?” 

“She’s on holiday.”

“Oh–you’re covering?”

“Uh-huh,” the sound of my voice was egregious to me. 

She nodded over to the cafe. “Would you mind getting started over there, please? Someone’s just wee-weed on the floor.”

My attraction to her died that instant. I filled my bucket full of lemon soap and hot water, before dragging it over to the pool of “wee-wee” (!) I finished up the floor and got started in the cafe; sweeping crumbs off tables, wiping down chairs, before running the shitty Henry-Hoover over the sticky floor. 

It was nearly half eight when I got done, and all the play centre staff had left. I sighed. I was so tired, and the constant smell of nappies grated on my senses. Waiting for me upstairs was the wreckage of a birthday party. Garish cellophane and dishevelled party hats were strewn over the floor. I crouched down and crawled inside the jungle gym itself. Cake crumbs and sticky fingerprints were smeared across the interlocking foam flooring and walls. I cleared as much as I could, before shuffling back out of the cramped tunnel to empty the pan. 

It takes a lot to gross me out these days. What I noticed in the pan didn’t gross me out as such, but gave me pause. Amidst the party crumbs was a single strand of human hair. There’s nothing abnormal in that; kids pull each other’s hair out all the time. The weird thing is that this hair was silver. 

Wrinkling my nose, I lowered the dustpan into the cafe bin. Someone’s grandma must have followed their grandchild into the squishy tunnel and got stuck. Maybe they had smuggled in some red wine to pass the time, while their infant threw themselves at other kids and into ball pits for hours. It must have been a very small old lady who could fit in there. 

Once the crumbs were clear, I shuffled back out of the tunnel. It wasn’t easy; even at five foot five, I was too long for the environment and ended up back-crawling out of the warren like a fat badger. The soft play’s cushions were warm to the touch, but it was freezing in the cafe area. I pulled my jacket closer over my uniform. If the janitors had turned the central heating off, I was probably the only person left onsite. I never thought I cared about working late, but the idea of the empty swimming pools and miles of deserted corridors gave me a creepy feeling. I’d never been at the Leisure centre this late before. Maybe that’s why my soul left my body when I caught sight of a leering face out of the corner of my eyes. 

It was, of course, only the beetle-bin; its plastic mouth  incapable of anything more than a shit-eating grin. Laughing, I sauntered over to it and produced another cloth from my pocket. I sprayed the synthetic cheek with blue window cleaning fluid and scrubbed coffee spots off the white cast teeth. 

“Why would they put this in a kids’ play centre?” Don’t get me wrong; the hideous, sordid creature was probably charming when it was new. In its present state, only Russ McKamey would choose it for furniture. The sleazy effect was not helped by the slogan slapped on the wall above in yellow bubble-writing: Can you find the tunnel Wig?

I fucking hope not. I finished polishing the bin, and reached to unscrew its grey head. I carefully held my breath as I ducked close to its mouth to prevent the damp, rotten smell of the rubbish from invading my senses. It did not. 

I jumped back from the beetle-bin. Its many limbs were fixed in a perpetual shrug. You get used to freaky stenches when you clean for a living, but this smell was different. Think sickly-sweet birthday cake frosting, mixed with banana peels and those button mushrooms that languish at the bottom of the vegetable draw. Think mould furring on apples, or a halloween pumpkin left out in the rain until January. 

What the hell were they putting in there? I peered at the bin with renewed caution. It probably hadn’t been changed in months. I double-gloved my hands and craned my neck back as I reached forward to carefully unscrew the beetle’s head. Had someone brought their hamster in, only for it to escape and die at the bottom of the barrel? It smelled too sweet to be a carcass, but as I inched closer and closer to the beetle-bin, I reconsidered. Sweaty hands closed round suppurating peaches. A stomach distended from a manic binge. The devil’s smoothie. It actually made my head swim as I placed my hands on the Beetle’s smiling cheeks and slowly unscrewed the top. 

The black plastic rustled, and a waft of death assaulted my senses. I turned my nose away, pressed my lips together and coiled the bin bag closed around my finger. Slowly, I lifted it, only to find that the liner was stuck to the bin’s bottom. Whatever was making the unholy smell had leaked through the plastic and solidified. 

“Oh God,” I gingerly shook the bin to loosen it, to no avail. No wonder Nadia never changes it, I thought, they should just chuck this in a skip. It was too far behind the cafe area to get proper use anyway, yet I could not (in good conscience) neglect my duties by leaving the spoiled bag in situ. Kids use this space. Whatever was in the bag, it wasn’t safe. Besides, I didn’t want Nadia to think I had half-arsed it (or Craig, for that matter.)

“Come on, come on,” I whispered, half to the beetle and half to myself. That was when I felt it: a sharp, piercing stinging on the back of my clenched palm. It was acute, like a dog bite, but as I pulled my hand away with a cry, it oozed until my whole hand throbbed.

“What the fuck?!” I staggered back, pressing hard on my hand that shrieked in pain. I lifted my fingers for a second to see if my skin was broken. I turned my hand over, then back again, looking for a welt or a cut. Not only was there no blood–but there was no mark to be seen at all. Worse still was the feeling that succeeded; a cold, prickly realisation, like sweat breaking on my brow, that I was not alone. 

My nerve broke like a twig beneath my feet. I kicked the hoover back into the cleaning cupboard. grabbed my cleaning caddy and hared out of there. I thundered down the stairs and back into the reception bay, before jamming the key code in and throwing back the door. I didn’t stop running until I got to the cloakroom. Just as I pulled my bag over my shoulder, I realised how absurd the whole thing was. I stood there, panting, and checking my hand over again. Nothing. 
I sighed, and trudged back to reception to clock out. I scribbled something down in the incident book. If there was some kind of biting-bug infestation in the beetle-bin, there was no way the play centre was fit for public use. Perhaps the closing mechanism on the lid was rusted and my hand had caught on the hinge. That explained it. The stench…well, that would be gone as soon as the janitor team saw my note in the maintenance book. They’d just cart the bin off and hurl it in the landfill, where it belonged. As for the creepy feeling? That was me, I thought, just being a scaredy little bitch. 

These explanations are so rational that I can almost bring myself to believe them. Thing is, I’m on the bus to work now to start the next shift. Has anyone got any idea what might be in that beetle-bin that stinks so horribly? Ideally I don’t want to hear suggestions about severed limbs or dead kids. I’d feel a lot better if I knew what to tell the janitors so they take it away asap. If anyone’s come across anything like this before, please let me know if you can. 

Thanks for reading. Once again, sorry for any typos. I’m writing this on my phone. I’ll post an update tomorrow sometime if anything else weird happens.

We started chatting and we found out we had a lot of things in common. I call her on a date and she says yes.

The days leading to the date she said how special I am, how she's lucky to have found me, how she's anxious to meet me, ""where were you this whole time?"" so on and so forth. Ngl I found this to be a little weird because we just met and such, but I ignored it because we had a lot of common and I was really excited for this date.

When the date comes, (Saturday afternoon coffee date) I could see she was really nervous, and I was kind of nervous too, so I tried to make her as comfortable as possible when going out. After leaving the cafeteria, she said she wanted to spend some more time with me. Took her to the city plaza and we cuddled, kissed and just spent the time talking to each other more comfortably. Time goes on and it's night time, do I take her out to dinner.

After dinner she asked if I wanted to go to her place. Mentioned that I had to go buy condoms (I wasn't expecting sex on the first date), she said it's ok because she has condoms back at her place. Alright then.

We went back to her place and start making out, getting naked and touching each other, she's jacking me off. When I'm about to take her panties off, she abruptly grabs my hand, look at me dead in the eye and says

""Sorry, but I'm not on the mood.""

I WAS SO FUCKING CONFUSED. My brain must have done a full tilt because I was speechless for a few seconds trying to find what to say. 

""It's ok."" That's that. I get up and put my underwear back on, she puts back hers, we sit at her couch and just cuddle. We kiss and what not, but nothing beyond that. Spent the night at her place.

Sunday morning I come back home, we still kept chatting, though I noticed she wasn't as present as before. Asked her out again, she said ""not this week I need some alone-time."" And that's when I stopped messaging because I knew she wasn't interested anymore. And I was right, she hasn't sent me anymore messages.

In any case, we were part way through the meal when my stomach and ulcerative colitis just said, ""NO,"" and I felt nauseous. Wasn't sure which end anything wanted to come out of. We went home shortly after (I felt so bad) and I went straight to bed. It was difficult to burp and the abdominal pain just wasn't having it. I've been on mesalamine enemas, but admittedly haven't been as consistent-- I want to think that if I resume, it'll help. 

Are these pains normal? I'm up now and my stomach still feels really acid reflux-y. Granted, I had other things prior to the dinner that I wasn't supposed to (soda, coffee, bad, I know, but I'd been working almost a 60-hour week and the struggle has been real). 

I'm going to try some peppermint tea and get some omeorazole and yogurt. Do you all have any recommendations on how to relieve this pain? Does this ever happen even when you're doing better about maintaining a UC diet of sorts? (I usually do.)

tl;dr: Went to dinner, had severe abdominal/gas pain for the first time since being diagnosed. Is this normal, and how do we rectify it?

Brewing methods tried: 

• V60 (boiling water) - Best results, especially when cooled down to 60-70 degrees
• V60 (cooler temps around 93-95)
• Espresso
• Aeropress with Prismo

Impression: 

This coffee tasted really good as a hot V60 or a hot Aeropress. At lower temps it lacked that acidity and had that strong spice heavy anaerobic taste. As a espresso it did not work at all, and with milk you could never taste the coffee much unless you went for a faster shot and boosted the acidity. This was a very typical dry anaerobic, with pronounced spicy notes and a fairly light body. 

Final Rating: 3.5/5. For the price it's nothing super impressive, it should be priced lower, but it's Subko so they add their 'marketing' costs into their coffee too. I'd skip this one and look at other roasters who offer a far better VFM.",3,1740245876.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.8,False

This confused me because just last week on my birthday my son (10M) gave me a coffee mug that says exactly the same thing and obviously there can only be one ""World's Best"" because that's how absolutisms work. I asked my co-worker where he got the mug and he said that his daughter gave it to him last year for Father's Day.

When I got home, I confronted my son and asked him whether he knew my co-worker or his daughter. He seemed confused and said no, which shocked me - how could he possibly have rated me as ""World's Best"" without even comparing to geographically proximate peers?!

I then proceeded to ask him what metrics or KPIs he used to score dad ability and what his sample size of the world's dads he had used in his determination of me as ""World's Best"". He just said, ""Dad, you're being weird.""  Finally I asked to see his raw data and he said, ""I don't know what that is.""

So of course I grounded him and took away all of his electronics. My wife thinks I'm being too harsh, but I don't see how I can overlook his speaking in absolutisms when he has exactly zero basis for this kind of judgement. I would have been fine if he had given me a coffee mug that said, ""Dad Who Exceeds Expectations"" or something like that, but ""World's Best"" is just an untruth too big to ignore. So am I really TA for punishing my son for trying to cover up his laziness in research methods with a blatant lie?

I hate how I never know how much time I have left, not only with the body of the person I love, but with some new part of his soul I never realized could be hacked off by fragments.

I am thinking this as the doctors talk to me and my father today about a pacemaker, a device to keep his blood pumping with enough force to nourish the tumor now occupying his brain. 

Over the past 13 months, this cancer has devoured so much of what made my father who he was, even as, whether graciously or sadistically, it has largely  spared his 190lb body. This once brilliant lawyer and driven cyclist, whose obsession with cardiac fitness and prolonging his healthy lifespan led to regular 100-mile bike rides and a resting heart rate in the 50s, now inhabits a mechanical bed where he only wakes to eat or gnaw on a white industrial hospital blanket. Like the original tumor in his right temporal lobe, he’s insatiable, grabbing toward his mouth my coffee or a third croissant or a box of tissues or that same hospital blanket, all without any expression of pleasure. He sleeps most of the day now. When he's awake, he speaks sparingly, staring glassy-eyed at commercials for diabetes medications, chewing on his blanket while a condom catheter drains his bladder. 

The grief comes in gusts: shocking and painful but still sometimes welcome. Grief to shock me to life. Grief to pierce the mundane—the sterile logistics of dying—or not dying—in America. 

While the doctors talk about hyperattenuations on MRIs and the nurse dispenses a cholesterol medication in applesauce—initially prescribed to forestall death from the heart by a mere 4 months-- I fill out forms. I repeat the list of pharmaceuticals I’ve memorized. Each new doctor’s visit or hospital visit grants new forms with the same questions and not enough space with which to answer them. Nowhere is there ever the question of why. 

There is good news, today ... or so the nurse says. The latest MRI is ""stable."" The good news is that the disease we can see anatomically via magnetic waves hasn’t grown. But what about the disease that we cannot measure in millimeters? That even as it isn’t showing on the MRI, has taken my father’s ability to walk, to control his bowels, to do The New York Times Crossword puzzle? The disease that has taken his smile and laugh and even his once legendary and terrifying anger, especially when he was first diagnosed: keppra-enraged and so furious at this tumor and all of us who did not have to live with and die from this terrible cancer?

There are endless tasks to accomplish. PT sessions to arrange. Transportation to plan. Briefs to change. Getting his doctors to switch his blood thinner to an oral medication to spare his battle-bruised belly from twice daily jabs. We rearrange the bed. We massage his neck. We do not talk about why, we just do. 

The oncologist hedges the prognosis. Do not ask, she seems to say, for we cannot know what fate the gods have in store for us. Better to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. But I am unable to do either well, so I've scoured pubmed to learn the median life expectancy for someone his age: 11 months. Gliosarcoma, his subtype of glioblastoma, promises an even more rapid progression and an even poorer life sentence than other forms of GBM, with mean untreated survival of 3-4 months. It's a brain cancer so aggressive there are horror-movie inspired case reports where it bursts through the skull.  His genetic markers confirm our terrible luck: wild-type and unmethylated, unlikely to respond to the standard chemo. 

Faced with those odds, we opt for the treatment that exists: 6 weeks of radiation, possibly pointless chemotherapy, and even a clinical trial, requiring weekly labs and EKGs. For six months, this all seems to keep my father's fight alive. Until this summer, when both suddenly and sluggishly, parts of my father stop working, even as his pulse and his breath stay strong.

Right now, my dad is hospitalized for bradycardia, the medical term for a slow heart rate. Instead of pumping at least 60 times a minute in order to satisfy human physiology, his heart now contracts only 30 times a minute with an irregular rhythm known as atrial fibrillation. It's a low enough heart rate objectively that the nurse practitioner at his oncologist’s office immediately slaps external pacer pads on his still hairy chest and sends him via EMS to the emergency department for an urgent cardiac evaluation, even after I tell her this has happened at least 5 times before and that each time, he has remained hemodynamically stable, with the same baseline great blood pressure and same terrible mental status. He has thrice refused a pacemaker. The tumor has taken his ability to convey his medical wishes now, but if he could, he'd refuse again.

""He is ""Do not intubate, do not resuscitate,”"" I confirm to at least 4 different people between the emergency room and his partitioned hospital bed, until one of the scrubs finally makes make me codify those words on a pink legal form, despite the fact that I've already given his doctors his living will and advance directives. No matter how often my family and I have talked about what my father values--aggressive treatment as long as his brain and body persist, but no wish to prolong mere biological existence with machines--each time I say ""DNR,""  I feel the piercing guilt of the faithless. Do I not believe in the miracle--of God or of modern medicine--to resurrect who my father once was? 

What I do not say, but want to say is this: so much of my father has already died and will never come back. If his body dies, please let him stay dead. 

And I know it's that thinking --which sometimes even flirts with wishing and hoping--that's behind my immense guilt and the shame. All the times I've left my daughter to rush to the hospital, all the plans I'm no longer making, all the life my family and I are ceding while he chews on his hospital blanket. I'm not the one with cancer, I remind myself. Stop making this about me. This is not about me. And yet --

My father loved reading. He loved philosophy. He loved history. He loved writing. He loved to travel. He loved hoisting his granddaughter on his shoulders at baseball games. He is still here, but those loves are not. He no longer recognizes his only granddaughter. 

Six months ago, on a drive home from the main cancer hospital in the city, we discussed a podcast about the rise and fall of the Aztec empire, remembering an old trip to Chichen Itza. My sister was stuck at the hotel with my mother and terrible food poisoning, but somehow spared, we explored the ruins. We spoke about the counterfactuals, as there always are, in world history and our own ... we could be speaking Nahuatl rather than English, living in Cemanahuac instead of New York. That conversation feels like a distant memory now, as he hasn't been able to speak spontaneously or say more than 2-3 words in 2-3 months. And faded into distant memory is any ability I have to imagine the counterfactuals.

I hate glioblastoma. At some point with this terrible disease, there is no earthy ability to ""resuscitate."" A pacemaker may make my father's heart look better on the cardiac monitor. But a pacemaker will not bring my father back. ",10,1740245490.0,glioblastoma,0,1.0,False

It's all fine when I shower, there's no scent until I reach hour 11-12 after showering. 

I don't experience any itching or pain, just a white-yellowish and clear discharge every possible day. I thought it was ovulation but as it has been happening for a while, I don't think that's the case anymore.

I don't know if my pH is a bit unbalanced as I've been eating like thrash lately, I drink a lot of coffee and pure orange juice, I don't drink that much water lately and I have been showering with different gel that wasn't pH neutral even tho I've switched to pH neutral one 2 weeks ago.

If I'm in a warm environment with polyester pants on which is my uniform that I can't not wear, the scents gets really strong. Sometimes it's rather musky than yeasty but it never smells fishy so I assume it's not BV or any infection.

I never pick up that scent from other women so I have been wondering if what I'm experiencing is normal. I don't want to be on antibiotics as I have regular sinusitis so I appreciate a break from them, I tried drinking cranberry juice which helped me last time when I did have a lot of itching and pain but now it did nothing about the smell and I can't wear pads every day as they get rather heated when I'm wearing polyester.

If it's not normal, what do I do? I feel it's pretty weird if I go to my doctor and ask them if it's normal to have that scent down there without any other symptom of infection but it may be because I'm simply embarrassed to admit I have that flaw.

Typically I have one cup of coffee in the morning, but today, my cup was the size of two cups. After finishing my YouTube video, I got straight to reading. I was able to focus so much better than I usually do. There were still instances of me skipping over words and being distracted by my thoughts, but they happened a lot less frequently than usual.  
  
Being neurodivergent can be very challenging. I have a lot of good ideas when it comes to writing, but I always tend to procrastinate because I second guess myself. If I need to start drinking more caffeine in order to write more, I gladly will. Nothing matters except my writing, so I wish I could act like it. 

Having more focus on my reading was also awesome. I felt like I was going to cry tears of joy because of my focus. I’m deeply insecure about my lack of focus so I am glad to have taken caffeine in order to help me. I think I should also meditate on caffeine to see how it affects me.

In hindsight, all the symptoms I attributed to depression (fatigue, appetite changes, weight gain, etc), were clear of T2D. My blood sugar was at 206 (non fasting) and my A1C was at 8.8. 

I was put on 1000mg of Metformin daily, 3 months later my A1C was at 5.9 (I made a lot of changes). My doctor then worked me up to 1mg of Ozempic and 500mg of Metformin. Since being diagnosed, I’ve lost about 20lbs. 

However, even with all this medicine, my blood sugar averages over 106 (90 days, Dexcom CGM). Is it still high? I don’t understand. For example, my fasting glucose today is at 126. It just feels like there’s something wrong and maybe I’m making my diabetes worse??? Even with all this medicine, my body is still not within a normal glucose range. 

My diet mostly consists of protein and complex carbs. I do still eat fruit because that’s all I can think of eating on Ozempic. Occasionally, I will have a sweet treat and some iced coffee. Other than that, I try not to eat foods/snacks high in sugar. Part of my job requires me to be very physically active, so it’s not like I’m sedentary. 

I guess my question is: can diabetes get worse and if so, is mine getting worse?

My dating journey has been so remarkably un-eventful that my grad school team chose it as their case study project will share the slides if you are interested! 

Looking back, it's been a series of near-misses and almost-connections: sometimes I was interested but they weren't, other times they were interested but I wasn't, and in those rare instances when we both felt the spark, the timing just refused to align.

So here I am on a quiet Saturday evening, having spent the entire day drifting between various coffee shops, carefully crafting this write-up over countless cups of coffee. After finally gathering some liquid courage through a few beers, I've decided to put myself out there one last time on Reddit before I give up hopes and try my luck on matrimony apps. They say third time's the charm, right? 

Okay so who I am ?. 

**Basic Demographic Information:**

* **Where I'm from:** I am a small-town girl from Telangana.
* **Age:** 29; I'll be 30 soon, I was born in April 1995.
* **Where I'm currently based:** Bengaluru.
* **Height:** 5'4""
* .**Religion & Caste:** Catholic & Reddy (My family converted generations ago).

**Education :** I hold a Master's in Business Analytics (MSBA) from a mildly popular B-school in the east, building upon my foundation in BSc Mathematics 

**Profession :** Currently, I work as a Business Intelligence Developer. Sigh - it’s the only corporate job I was able to land after moving back to India.

**About my Income:** Comfortable, but not in Reddit’s ""tech salary"" league. I do just enough to keep the tax authorities interested, even with the recent relief measures. Having switched careers with only two years of relevant work experience it’s the best I could get in this market (happy to share the exact number in DM’s)

**Hobbies :** I've had plenty of time to explore various passions. I've picked up several musical instruments, thanks largely to my Sunday school background. My younger sister's career as a psychologist sparked my interest in psychology books, and I've ventured into some unexpected territories like pole dancing (because why limit ourselves?). I even got into reading birth charts - sometimes it's nice to have the stars to blame for life's little mishaps! There's more to my hobby list, but these give you a glimpse into my curiosity about life.

**I'm fluent in several languages:** 

* Telugu (my mother tongue, of course), 
* Kannada (thanks to my undergrad years and 2+ years of working in Bangalore with wonderful local friends)
* English and I can also manage conversation in Hindi, though it's not perfect - credit goes to my best friend who refuses to speak with me in any other language!

**My family :** consists of my parents (both still actively working), my sister, and my grandmother. we're all financially independent of each other

**Now for the deeper stuff - let's call this the Director's Cut of who I am and what I believe in.**

**When it comes to religion and caste:** I'll be completely honest: I don't strongly identify with either. Growing up with mixed traditions led to some identity questioning, but it's helped me develop a broader perspective. While I believe in a higher power, I'm open-minded about spirituality. I'm ready to respect and embrace your background, traditions, and celebrations that matter to you. 

**Regarding marriage and commitment** \- I haven't personally witnessed even a single truly happy marriage, either in my family or outside. However, what I have seen, and what I deeply believe in, is the beauty of two people consistently making efforts to build a life together. I'm unwaveringly committed to monogamy - this isn't negotiable for me, and if you see things differently, we probably won't be a good match.

**On gender roles and household responsibilities:** I take a practical approach. Life isn't always a perfect 50-50 split; some days it might be 20-80, and I'm fine adjusting as needed. However, as a career-oriented woman, I'm looking for a partner who either actively contributes to household duties or is comfortable hiring help. The expectation of working a full day at the office and then handling all household responsibilities solo is not something I'm willing to accept.

**Financial management :** I deeply respect money and shy away from consumerism, firmly believing in saving first and spending second. 

**This extends to my views on marriage celebrations ( a deal breaker for me)** \- I'm not interested in elaborate, expensive weddings costing 50-60 lakhs for just a few days of celebration. Instead, I envision a simple court marriage followed by either a cocktail party or an intimate fine dining experience with close friends and family, depending on your comfort with alcohol.

**Children and Family planning** is something I'm still contemplating. I have serious concerns about bringing new life into today's world, which often feels like it's becoming increasingly challenging. If we do choose to have children - and this would be a decision we'd make together **- I'm firm about having only one child. This is a non-negotiable point for me.**

**Conflicts and Communication**, I believe in giving space and respecting boundaries. I prefer taking time to cool off when needed, communicating clearly about how much time we need, and then having honest, drama-free discussions. No yelling, no throwing things, no harsh words - just mature dialogue and resolution.

**Lifestyle preferences:** I enjoy my social drinks - perhaps a beer or cocktail once or twice a month. I'm also 420-friendly and occasionally enjoy a joint, though this is quite rare. I believe in being transparent from the very beginning.

**My Red Flags:** In the spirit of complete transparency, hahahaha.

The most significant ones are my trust issues and an avoidant attachment style. These weren't born in a vacuum - they're the product of past relationship experiences and growing up in a family environment that wasn't always the healthiest. 

But here's the important part: I'm actively working on these aspects of myself. I'm in therapy, committed to personal growth, and continuously striving to be the best version of myself. I believe in facing these challenges head-on rather than letting them define me or my future relationships.

**So here is what I want from my potential Inti Ayana (aka Husband) :** 

I view marriage as at least a 30-year commitment (given current life expectancy), so it's crucial to find someone who not only complements my life but brings out the best in me. I need to feel genuinely happy and authentic when I'm with my future husband.

**Age :** I'm looking for someone between 30-35 years old, no filters on mother tongue, caste or religion

**Character matters deeply to me.** My ideal partner would be honest to his core, demonstrating genuine respect for both me and women in general. I value patience, kindness, and empathy, combined with confidence , someone who can engage in both deep intellectual discussions and silly banter - versatility in conversation is important to me.

**Regarding emotional baggage -** let's be real, we all have some. I don't care about what happened in your past, as long as it stays there and you've genuinely moved on. I understand that our experiences shape us, and we all have our own demons to wrestle with. What matters to me is that you believe in personal growth and, if needed, are open to therapy and actively working on yourself.

**Financial compatibility is crucial**. I'm seeking someone who shares my belief in minimalistic living, approaches financial goals realistically, and tends to be risk-averse in financial matters. 

**Career-wise,** I'm not hung up on specific roles or industries. What matters is that you're ambitious and passionate about your chosen path. I want to see drive, clear goals, and consistent effort toward achieving them.

**When it comes to health and lifestyle,** I'm not expecting a movie star physique, but I do value someone who takes care of themselves. Just as I commit to my six-days-a-week gym routine and healthy eating habits, I expect my partner to prioritize their health and well-being.

**I'm quite open-minded about lifestyle choices and personal vices,** provided they're managed responsibly. I actually prefer someone who maintains their own social circle and enjoys their independence - whether that's regular boys' nights out or whatever helps you maintain your individual identity.

**Some wonderful bonuses would be** a good sense of humor, an interest in cooking, music and art , being comfortable with your feminine side, having a way with words, and possessing strong social skills.

**However, there are certain red flags that I won't compromise on:**

\- Maintaining close friendships with exes (this suggests unresolved attachments)

\- Any form of dishonesty

\- Inconsistency between words and actions

\- Moving too quickly in relationships

\- Hypocrisy

\- Jealousy

\- expecting dowry/gifts.

These deal-breakers aren't arbitrary - they come from experience and a clear understanding of what makes a relationship healthy and sustainable. I'm not looking for perfection, but I am looking for someone who aligns with these core values and expectations.

My Linea Mini R is finally home. It still feels unreal waking up to this machine each morning. My coffee journey began six years ago when I was a sophomore in high school. I started with pour overs, using a cheap gooseneck kettle and a V60. Then, during my first year at university, I purchased my first ever machine, a Breville Barista Express.

I always knew I wanted to upgrade, so I diligently saved every year, never touching that money. At the end of my third year at university, I found an amazing deal on Facebook Marketplace: an ECM Technika IV Profi in excellent condition for just $1,000. I paired it with my Brevilles built in grinder for a year until I stumbled upon another steal, a Eureka Mignon Perfetto for $200!

After selling it last year and nearly doubling my initial cost, I saved up for a few more months. Finally, I was able to invest in a Linea Mini R and a Fiorenzato AllGround Sense grinder. Although i'm broke now, i'm hoping to get Acaia brew by weight scale soon. IT NEVER ENDS!

I would love to hear some advice on how to keep this machine in tip top shape! If you have one, I'd appreciate learning from your experiences.

1ivnw12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ivnw12/i_feel_so_dumb/,I feel so dumb,"Long story so bare with me. My gf and I had been together for 7 years. Then last year things started to get weird. She started to become very distant and I mentioned it. We talked it through and things were immediately better, or so I thought, until the very beginning of this year. 

She told me about a friend she had. This guy she met outside of work at a coffee shop. Her local barista. I got kind of weird about it but I brushed it off bc I tend to be an insecure person. I try to make myself seem confident but at times when she talks about other guys I get a little jealous. I move on though and tell myself I need to work on myself and trust her. 

They went out on their own a couple times through out the last few months. I was never invited and I never invited myself. I thought, I can’t just be inviting myself. Although I think it’s kind of strange that she was going out alone with this guy I’ve never met. 

Then she mentioned she was going to the movies with him. I had no idea. I told myself, “it’s whatever they’re just friends.” I suddenly get this urge to go through her phone when she’s asleep. I tell myself, “what the fuck am I doing I never want to be the crazy boyfriend.”

I start scrolling through her messages and they felt… wrong. They were talking about “if isn’t weird I’d go see you everyday.” Mentioning things like napping together. Counting down the days for their “movie date.” I felt very sick to my stomach. She would never physically cheat on me or at least I think but this just felt so wrong. 

I confronted her about it. It turned into a huge fight. She started telling me that I make her feel guilty for leaving the house. Doing things with her friends. That I make her feel bad for wanting to be independent in the relationship. 

I do tend to be very clingy and that was always some sort of issue that I know I needed to work on. I was working on it. I never told her she couldn’t be on her own. I encouraged it. I told her that I’m happy she’s doing things. Working on her school and work and fitness. I was proud of her. But man I felt so betrayed. 

I even told her I can forget about all of this if she just stops with the emotional affair. We had two dogs together. We were extremely close with each others families. Family vacations. Spending all the holidays together. I didn’t wanna throw it all away bc we’ve worked so much on this relationship. I was willing to stay and make things work. She said she couldn’t deal with the guilt that she was having an emotional affair and that she checked out of the relationship a while back. I feel like an idiot. Trying to stay with her. Why am I so stubborn? 

We had such a good life together until these last few months when things started escalating. I cried with her parents saying goodbye. Saying goodbye to our dogs. I feel so hurt and honestly sometimes I don’t even know what to feel at all.

This the first time I felt hard  rate and I started feeling hot and my body start shivering. I drove myself to the emergency room and they gave me IV fluids after checking my heart rate and I think I was having anxiety not knowing what was going on. 

I have felt stressed many times at work and my eating habits aren’t great before my sentence visit. Since I worked an extra job my sleep hasn’t been great either cause I’ll only have less than 7 hours with my morning job. I also have BMI 37 and I was told I had high cholesterol at one of doctors appointments but last blood work visit she told me everything looked good just my last bloodwork with my primary doctor in October last year. I am also on EluRyng Birth Control (estronogestrel /0.120mg and ethinyl /0.015mg vaginal ring per day.

I also have bloating issues and I was prescribed 
Pantoprazole and I stopped taking it but my stomach seems to get triggers when I eat something. I can’t figure out the food items that do it to my stomach. I also have neglected water and was doing juice and sodas but I haven’t had sodas this year even before my hospital visit. 

For my first hospital visit 1/31/25, I was given IV and my blood work and all that came back negative for thyroid issues, but my urine was real yellow and I figured I dehydrated cause I don’t get water in. They have me IV fluid and my heart rate when back down and I did have any issues till 3 weeks later and I was eating junk again ( my fault on my part). 

My nurse and doctor told me I should drink ALOT of water and minimize sodium (I asked her what the limit would be and she couldn’t answer that) and I have  had a daily coffee intake and Tea as well but mostly coffee. I was told no caffeinated drinks. 

When I followed up with my primary care doctor in February last month everything was fine and at that time still no episode came up. 

When I ate junk food probably those last / weekends or this last week of me having any salad. I was seeing the sodium content on the products but they were somewhat over 110-220 per product when I ate them and just other day a place I got my tea from have my a Bold Breakfast tea and I too a sip before realizing it didn’t taste what I usually get and seen it had caffeine in it. I poured the rest out. 

I didn’t feel any episode but when I went to work yesterday I was moving around a lot and drinking some water but last few days I didn’t drink as much. I had started feeling hot and my Apple Watch was staying at 118bpm then rose to 120 then went higher when I was standing at a cash register. I reached 162bpm when I sat down and my boss called school nurse for me. she checked my pulse threw finger and my heart rate when down to 89 then 110bpm after a couple minutes. I told her I was diagnosed with sinus trachycardia and I was told I was dehydrated but to avoid caffeine and minimize sodium. 

I thought  I would go to emergency room after my mom picked me up and drove my car home but I was shivering when this happened. Later that night I was at my computer and I felt my heart race again and i felt cold and was shivering and I went into bed and my heart went normal. I was then drinking water again and getting multiple water bottles in  to flush my system out. I fell asleep by 9pm and woke up early this meaning and I went back to sleep again. My mouth felt dry so I’m drinking water.

 I do go to work tonight so I hope I’m alright tonight. it’s hard getting water in when I’m working.

Let’s get some solutions in the chat.

Here’s mine:

Huge disclaimer: I’m BP2, BPD, and ADHD. I don’t know what works or doesn’t work beyond those diagnosis, or for other people as a whole.

**Your intuition:**

Your intuition will usually be right but sometimes it’ll be wrong (world’s most helpful statement, I know). The key is to know what things you deep-down want to avoid. For me that’s endurance exercise (which helps my mood dramatically), productivity and showers. I can usually trust my intiuition about my illness, except when it comes to getting myself to do those things.

**The mood cycle as a whole:**

The most important thing is to know what your cycle is. For me, it was always four months of depression (except two months last time, which, yay), then one-month steady improvement, then a huge decision point -- either one week of hypomania or two months of euthymia depending on how well I managed it. Again, the most important thing is to **know your cycle**. Know what makes it longer, know what makes it shorter.

**Hypomania:**

The ultimate trick to mania is to do the opposite of what it wants to do. Act like you weren’t manic. It wants you to powerwalk everywhere? Walk slower than usual. It wants you up all night? Force yourself to stay in bed. It’s hard but you got this.

**Depression:**

I think I’m running out space so I’ll just say this for now: there’s several types of depression, they all suck, and it differs for all of them. For me there's three types: dull, sharp, and silly. Dull -- stay out of bed. Sharp -- drink coffee and move around. Silly -- count down from 1000. More on these later.

If this has been helpful to people I might make more of these. Let me know.

I started about 2 and a half months ago and it did have some side effect like I got irritated easily and had to force myself to eat breakfast. But over all pretty worth it. Doctor started me off at 20 mg and it was working then about 2 weeks in it stopped working. She upped it to 30 and it slowly started to go down and now it’s no longer working again. My husband keeps reminding me that I need to give myself grace and I will find my right dose but I am afraid because I hear things on here about “chasing a dragon” and that’s not my intention but I do not want to unknowingly develop a problem. I have cut down on caffeine significantly because I didn’t want it to interfere with my meditation. I used to drink about 600mg of caffeine a day and I am down to one cup of coffee a day. Am I “chasing the dragon” or am I just on a low dose and my body is becoming accustomed and I will find my correct dose? I am afraid to become dependent on any medications or substances in general because I have children and the entire reason I even considered meds in the first place is to be a better mother and person in general so developing an addiction while already struggling with my mental health is not a great idea. I’m going to schedule an appointment with my doctor to discuss this but wanted to hear your testimonies as well. ,3,1740244741.0,VyvanseADHD,4,1.0,False

I'm sure you know the feeling, sometimes I think my work is going win every award there is and then I re-read it and want to press delete. This is a chapter of a longer manuscript.

It wasn’t until we were standing in an open air market selling fish that it occurred to me we were actually in Italy. There was nothing more to plan and our only obligation was to simply live as a married couple. I felt weightless.  Having watched endless travel shows we felt as if we were more cultured with cuisine than other tourists. We would eat arancini for lunch from a stall then walk around the labyrinth of cobblestone streets while we killed time before our next meal, looking at pottery or dusty knives in the endless stalls before having an espresso and a Chesterfield. My only mission outside of the bedroom was food. I would specifically ask for what I was sure a tourist wouldn’t ask for: sea urchins with pasta, langoustine, tongue with pesto, though I could never find someone selling offal from a covered basket despite all my searching. The waiters would nod enthusiastically, thinking I’d order macaroni and cheese no doubt, but roll their eyes when after all my searching I’d point to the second least expensive bottle of red. Hopefully I’d tip like an American, I could almost hear them thinking.  
  
  
  
We drove along a route I had mapped out during lunch breaks at work but had no idea what to expect. We would stop to get lunch in little seaside towns that were staffed by people so friendly I wondered if they mistook us for someone else. When we arrived in Siricusa everything seemed like it was going to crumble into the sea from sheer age and seemed sandblasted from salt. The cathedral in the heart of town towered over tables set up in the square that belonged to the cafes. The waiters were always amused when they heard me ask for an ashtray in my best Italian and they would set my little potacenere down and we would spend the entire evening drinking prosecco and a glass of pale yellow limoncello would be thrown in when we told them it was our honeymoon. We would spend the nights talking about how the wedding went and looking for the next spot to have a drink at. Only very rarely would we be too drunk to make love, which was an unending pursuit for us.  
  
  
  
By the middle of the trip we had made our way to the middle of Sicily on our way to Palermo. It was October and all the trees were colors I had forgotten the way red leaves looked in Autumn. They filled these dips where the road dipped down in between them before going back up. You could see for miles at the tops of those mountains and it showed that the path would continue to wind through another valley and I would brace my consciousness to remember this beauty. Some of the little towns we went to were completely deserted. The houses were beautiful stone and with terracotta roofs turned grey by time, and vines grew out of the broken windows. In the middle of town sometimes there would be a cafe with a few people sitting at a bar but I didn’t feel brave enough to even use their toilet; whatever they were doing in these ruins felt sinister. They could be the ghosts that haunted this town for all I knew. A ruined castle at the top of the hill with a gate barring entrance. We got out to stretch our legs and, while taking in the crispness that high altitude lent air, Evelyn yelped with pain. I looked at her and she clutched her chest. Had she been shot? No, a rock had fallen from God knows where and hit her in the chest. We looked to see the source but silence abounded and there was not a soul that could have thrown it. Had a bird dropped it trying and failing to recreate the death of Aeschylus? I rushed over to her and she was nervous but said she wasn’t hurt, she was just startled.  
  
  
  
The town of Petralia Soprana was like the ghost town but alive. Entering town we were met with olive trees in the dusty hills before the roads became more narrow and turned to cobblestone. There seemed to be a church for every twenty people in the town, and inside them were statues of saints with arrows penetrating every limb. I would light two candles, one for Evelyn’s mother and one for my favorite aunt. The town square was populated with cafes and fountains and children playing loudly and bright clothes on washing lines above us and old men sitting on benches smoking cigarettes. As we sat at a table and I lit up a cigarette of my own I would look at them enviously. They had it all figured out. These men would spend all day chatting without a care in the world, have some coffee, and return home to a simple meal of local meats and herbs made by some eternally youthful raven-haired, olive-skinned Calypso. How I wanted to move.  
  
  
  
We stopped off at Cerfalu for a day and saw where all of the tourists who didn’t watch travel videos went. Here was a beautiful beach and every third shop was selling postcards and lighters and swimsuits. Here the menus were large sandwich boards showcasing just how low the fish & chips special was. They didn’t even sell the spaghetti with sea urchin at these places and the waiter was probably some expatriate from Manchester fretting over his visa now that Brexit had officially passed. As I noticed some trash from a chipper being picked over by a seagull down an alley I thought that soon we would be back to Waterford and life would be continuing on as it was before. In Palermo Evelyn wanted to rent a big double decker bus and I was horrified. What could possibly motivate you to want to get on one of those monstrosities? In a hurt tone she told me, ‘That’s what we had always done with on holiday with my mother.’ I felt terrible as she turned her face to shed a tear. So we got on the top of the bus and listened to the pre-recorded messages telling us about the gates of the city as grey clouds lightly sputtered rain. 

When we arrived at the airport the security officers must have been the same old men I’d seen in the squares of the little towns there.They would barely inspect anything, lazily waving through half-drunk bottles of water to our amazement We bought Noel a handle of whiskey at duty free, though it felt like buying a length of rope for someone suicidal. I, too, had my own rope to buy as the prices of cigarettes were astonishingly cheap. We spent the plane ride to Ireland wondering if the cat would even recognize us. Back in town I had a new computer I’d bought as a wedding present to myself. I’d spent hours agonising over the video card, the RAM and the monitor, asking the IT lady at work repeatedly if the extra 200 euro for an audio card was worth it. Rather than admiring the view of the Northern coast of Sicily, Evelyn was tormented by me explaining every feature I’d chosen. She couldn’t wait until I was finally locked away with my new obsession. Once assembled the LED lights shone a crimson red. In the darkness of night, when viewed through a window outside, it looked as if the little office was possessed by Satan himself.

Evelyn had decided to treat herself to a new sectional sofa as her gift and spent her evenings drawing out potential configurations for it in our little living room that was already ordained with decorative teapots and plastic plants. She had a whole little book of fabric samples she would brush endlessly and eventually decided on purple. When the couch itself arrived the men unloading it were amazed how it fit just like a jigsaw puzzle piece, not noticing the tape on the floor that served as her marker. The fit was so perfect she couldn’t help but cross her arms and nod at it with the same smile the cat had when he caught a bird. Now she had a perfect place to eat sandwiches and low fat chips and watch re-runs of Friends.

The first day back to work was like being reincarnated as a rat in a maze.  The time for congratulations was over. Instead it was back to me sitting at my desk, taking calls and watching the clock. Now, however, I had nothing to look forward to. There was nothing on my horizon, no life altering event in the coming future with which to preoccupy myself. I looked forward to my cigarette break in the little courtyard and then looked forward to lunch and then looked forward to my next cigarette break and then look forward to going home. Donald Trump had won the election and I called out the day after so I wouldn’t have to listen to everyone ask me what was wrong with Americans. Reading reddit on my phone made me feel as if they had miscalculated doomsday on the Mayan clock. The cycle, it seemed, could never be broken.  
  
  
  
My depression was worsening. The doctor was very amenable to anything I suggested and her complete trust in everything I told her made me want to tell her more. She wrote me a note to say that I should get longer breaks which I summarily abused as much as I could, though I felt unbelievably guilty when I put my phone on hold. I said the medication wasn’t working and she said we would try something else. She referred me to a therapist and I only went once after she told me the root of my depression was because of my dead-end job and not having any goals. How could she not see it was a disease like I told myself? Eventually she decided that I was treatment adverse after I had switched medication again for a third time. She asked if it was okay if she referred me to the psychiatric unit run by the state. The stigma was the only thing that kept me from saying yes right away, but soon I lost my ego.

I felt no different about going to the state people instead of a private practice and in fact I was a little excited. Maybe I’d get better because what I was dealing with were ordinary doctors and these were trained psychiatrists. I walked about a mile to get there through an unfamiliar part of town to the new building with an ominous little brick tower that seemed to serve no purpose other than to be tall. The initial interviews had the woman looking up from her clipboard. I can be very well spoken and I felt especially lucid talking to her, I remember giving answers so insightful that she might have suspected that I was coached in what to say. But it was that way, I felt like I knew what was wrong with me and knew what to do to get better but lacked the internal fortitude to do anything about it. But how could I go back to the moment my father told me, after learning a pet fish had died, that I was going to die too and tell the sobbing child in me to just accept that we are more than life and death?  When she filled me out a new prescription the pharmacist, who was a friend of a friend, pulled me aside and told me to be careful because this was serious medication. The drugs, I were told, were mood stabilizers and I felt completely defeated. How could my life turn on me like this? I told Evelyn everything that happened and she assured me things would be better.

I was given a mood stabilizer and I would go back once a month to see how I was getting on with it. I would make my way down to the basement where the psychiatric offices were and wonder if I was really sick while I waited. Often I felt as if I was just faking it, that this had all started out as a way for me to get some extra sick leave from a job I hated and I was just an exceptional liar because really I was strong enough internally to withstand all of my self-destructive tendencies. This feeling was just one side of a pendulum, though, and even I, my own harshest critic, could see that there was an underlying sadness that inhabited my internal world. But I knew not the source of this melancholy and I’d wonder if it was the remnants of my karma, of a previous life where I had done something evil but had no memory. For the first six months I would trudge past the tennis club and little churches on my way to the office and tell the doctor that everything was going well enough, that I guessed my mood had stabilized and they’d scribble in their notebooks and adjust the dosage until eventually they needed me to come in less and less frequently.

I did have goals. One was to open a cafe or diner or food truck. I wanted there to be a waffle house in Waterford. Eventually, Evelyn, surely tired of hearing my perpetual moaning about the neverending torrent of calls, found a course about starting your own business. After the first meeting and the enthusiastic reaction from the instructors I had a new purpose. As I began to sketch out a menu and wonder where this place could possibly be, I decided to quit my job. I just couldn’t take it any more and I convinced Evelyn that I was at the breaking point and put in my two weeks notice. Sometimes it seemed as if I needed a deliberate action from a divine source to make an important decision but here I found myself proudly throwing the letter on my manager’s desk. I watched triumphantly but he shrugged and said ‘It’s probably the best thing for you,’ without a hint of emotion in his voice.  
  
  
  
With that I began updating my resume and added the call center as more recent than the bank and the museum and the tobacco shop, my time at university feeling like it had happened in a previous life. I was reinvigorated at work and felt bulletproof. A woman called asking to change her doctor, to which I informed her she would need to get a change of doctor form and have her new GP sign it. No, she insisted, it’d be done over the phone. In the course of trying to explain that it wasn’t something that could be done over the phone she asked to speak with my manager. Again, I calmly explained that no one could change a GP without their signature, not even a manager. This was taken as insolence and she demanded to speak with a manager. ‘Okay,’ I said, ‘Here’s what I’ll do: I’ll take a message for a manager so he can call you back and tell you the exact same thing that I just did.’ Wow, said she in disbelief as I disconnected. Surely she complained by the time that she was called back because I was taken aside and given two options: work in the mail room for two weeks or just call it quits. I took the second option and nearly skipped out the door a free man.  
  
  
  
I had barely begun a new campaign to recreate the Roman Empire on my computer when I got a call asking me to come in for an interview. It was for an off license position with the fancy grocery store in town. Evelyn had worked there as a teenager and it was up towards Noel’s house in the suburban area of Waterford, selling things like bronze cut pasta and artisanal smoked butter. The interview took place in an office upstairs with a panoramic window giving a view of the entirety of the shop. At a little table in a plastic chair I sat down and they immediately brought up my experience in the cigar shop in Alexandria. I paused momentarily, having to remember that was something I’d done. They were the first people that brought it up. Every other interview I’d had in Ireland to this point made it seem like a job in America was so obscure that it couldn’t be mentioned. When they probed my knowledge of beer and spirits I had to temper my enthusiasm so they didn’t suspect I’d be hungover every day.  A day later the call came to tell me I was hired. I poured a glass of whiskey to toast whatever deity bestowed good luck and tried to finish my campaign in Northern Africa before my first day was to start.",2,1740244719.0,KeepWriting,2,1.0,False

I kid you not, every dude in there was like 6’4 and above. There was two dudes already in there when I walked in that were that tall, but as I was waiting in line 3 more guys walked in looking all around 6’4+

The girl behind the counter said something along the lines of “Omg everyone in here is so tall” the shortest dude besides me in there was legit like 6’3. And they all kind of laughed together. I sort of just had to put my head down and not acknowledge it. I mean she wasn’t deliberately trying to attack me but it’s just depressing, like I didn’t even exist. It’s like I didn’t count as a man being next to these guys. Completely left out of her mind as someone even being in there. This is why I hate going outside.

We keep cleaning the spots but he keeps going back. We clean his litterbox regularly, and do everything we can but we're at a loss now.

I live my life as a fairly typical guy, yet harbour an inner core that is very feminine.

She is almost toddler like in her need for attention and care.  Her Dad emotionally abused both of us until I finally kicked him out two years ago. I am entirely responsible for is financially and in every other way.  

Every day I get up, feed the dogs and cats, let the dogs out to do their business, get daughter her meds, have maybe 20 minutes for coffee then get on the computer for a full work day. I get two breaks and lunch, during which I get daughter food and spend time trying to deal with her anxiety.  I try really hard to prep dinner during one of my breaks.  At 6:30 pm we eat dinner and then head to the barn for 3 - 4 hours and help daughter do her barn chores (to help pay for horse’s care) and see her horse.  Then we head home and I take care of pets and watch some tv with daughter.  She finally goes to bed (I tuck her in) and I get 30 minutes to read before I go to sleep myself. Then I get up and do it all again.  On the weekends I try to clean, grocery shop, etc. It never ever ends.

Before you come at me and say she doesn’t need a horse - well she actually does. The coach was an equestrian coach. He would drag her into this horse’s stall to beat and rape her and the horse would literally try to put his body in between them and take the beating himself.  She would not have survived without him and I managed to rescue him after pulling her out.  No I did not know - her abuser threatened to kill the horse if she told.  

Anyway she is severely mentally ill.  She’s 23 now and I have no idea if this will ever get better.  Her Dad financially abused us as well, so I will not be able to retire from employment.

1ivnjpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/1ivnjpc/looking_for_a_roommate/,Looking for a roommate,"I’m planning to move to Frederick by April. I’m interested in renting an apartment in one of the new luxury developments (what can I say, I love nice appliances and whatnot). For example, I toured Upper East recently and came out pretty impressed. I could pretty easily rent a 1BR on my own, but would be interested in a 2BR or maybe even 3 BR situation (a) to save more money and (b) because being alone in a new town kind of sucks. 

The arrangement I have in mind: 
- A 2 BR would probably come out to $1,000 per person and a 3 BR would likely come out to $900 per person (assuming 2 and 3 people respectively).
- I have a nice TV, sofa, rug and coffee table that I’m happy to provide for the common space, as long as people are respectful of that space.
- Utilities will be split equally.
- My dog will have free rein in my room and in common areas, but others are obviously welcome to keep him out of their rooms. Obviously, I take full responsibility for my dog.
- Other pets are welcome as long as they are well trained + align with building policies AND again, keep in mind that I have a big dog and idk how he’d respond to other animals in his living space long-term.
- Everyone must be willing to contribute to having a cleaner come at least twice per month, as well as do their part to keep common spaces clean (and individual rooms/bathrooms not gross).
- Trust is important for this to work. Must pass the apartment’s background checks, be able to prove stable employment that pays for your part of rent and commit to ONE year. 
- No parties unless all occupants agree.
- Keep your hook ups in your rooms, don’t be gross in the common areas (especially the kitchen island :)) 
- No weed (stinky af) or illegal drugs in the apartment.
- Down to pool money for joint groceries or shop independently, as long as people are respectful (i.e. don’t be a moocher).
- The usual don’t be a dick or a creep stuff. 
- idc about gender, but no couples unless each person pays an equal share of the rent (i.e. if the rent is $3,000 for a 3 BR and two people + a couple live in the unit, the rent would be split four ways equally).
- no children, strongly prefer people in my age range (23-30)

About me: 26 year old male, work remote and have a big, but very well-trained, dog (I don’t go out too much). I make a little over $100k and am pretty securely employed. My girlfriend lives in NYC right now and will visit once per month for anywhere between a weekend and a week. My dog and I will also be gone once per month for a weekend (maybe a bit longer) to visit her in NYC.

Hello, my name is Max. I’m 25, straight male.

I’m looking for a long term role playing partner. (F.)

I can hit the character blocks multiple times per response, or simply send multiple paragraphs. 

I enjoy slow burn romances, 70/30 I have a couple oc’s that I quite enjoy and fit most situations. 

I respond extremely quickly, and if I can’t I always will let you know.

Feel free to pm me if you’re interested. I’ll send one of my oc’s per example as what to expect.

Name: Max Cross
Age: 35
Occupation: Director of the FBI
Appearance: Tall (6’4”), lean but well-built. His once-dark hair has turned prematurely gray from years of stress and responsibility. His sharp grey eyes hold the weight of secrets most people will never know. His arms, back, and chest are covered in intricate tattoos—some personal, some earned, some mistakes he chooses to carry.

Background:
Max Cross was a prodigy, joining the FBI at 21 after earning dual degrees in criminology and cybersecurity. He climbed the ranks at an unprecedented pace, solving high-profile cases, dismantling international crime syndicates, and uncovering corruption within his own agency. His rapid rise made him both respected and resented. At 26, after the sudden resignation of his predecessor, he was appointed Director—the youngest in history.

Personality:
Ruthless when necessary, but fiercely loyal to those he trusts. He operates in shades of gray, knowing that the world isn’t black and white. His mind is always three steps ahead, calculating risks, making moves before anyone else sees the game. Despite his hardened exterior, those who truly know him understand that he carries a deep, unspoken burden.

Habits & Traits:
    •    Runs on black coffee and little sleep.
    •    Smokes when he’s alone, a habit he picked up during undercover work.
    •    Has a habit of rolling a coin between his fingers when thinking.
    •    Keeps a gun on him at all times, even in the safest of places.
    •    Despite his power, he often feels like he’s still fighting a war he can’t win.

Reputation:
To the public, he’s the face of law and order. To his enemies, he’s a ghost, an unstoppable force that always finds a way. Inside the Bureau, he’s a legend—but legends burn bright, and some don’t last long.

Max Cross didn’t have the kind of childhood that led to an easy life. Born into a broken home, he learned early that the world was cruel, and survival meant being smarter, faster, and tougher than the people who wanted to break you. His father was a violent man, his mother a ghost of the person she used to be. By the time he was ten, he had already seen enough to know that justice wasn’t something given—it was something you took.

Foster care, the streets, the system—he moved through them all, never staying in one place long enough to call it home. He fought, he ran, he learned. By the time he was a teenager, he had already built an iron will, a mind that never stopped calculating. But instead of letting the world break him, he turned his rage into something sharper, something unstoppable.

Now, as Director of the FBI, Max speaks with a calm, steady voice, never raising it, never showing his hand. His words are deliberate, measured, almost kind. But behind them, there is a quiet, unrelenting fury—a rage that never died, only learned to be patient. Those who know him best understand that it’s not a matter of if he’ll strike back, but when. And when he does, it’s absolute.",1,1740243568.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

You have to REALLY watch the person making your cup of coffee or tea or they'll slip some in there by mistake,"My reason for sugar is more so, because I was truly oblivious to my health problems for years. Blame it on me being skinny my entire life, blame it on me not having any health knowledge at all, blame on the influence of sugar culture and etc.

But there was a really large portion of my life. Where I basically just ate like as if I could not die or get sick. I'm talking snacks with every meal, pints of ice cream every night, multiple cups of sugary Cafe drinks, not eating fruit or veggies for long stretches and more. 

Then as the years went, there were signs of my health declining. But I still didn't recognize what was happening until, I basically was intolerant to most foods out there. And that's basically where I stand today. Where I have to avoid most foods, spices, drinks and all. Or I'll my body will go into a flare up and I basically won't be able to function to a certain capacity. 

I'll say one good thing about this struggle. Is that it has taught me a lot of discipline and experiencing a clear mind ""some days"". Has really opened me up to the true person I can be, when my mind isn't flooded with distractions and sugar fogging my mind up. 

So due to all these food limitations, I usually only can eat at home. One thing I've recently got back into tho, was certain herbal teas. As it having good benefits to helping my acid reflux, ulcers and gastritis situation. 

But it's kind of crazy how something as simple, as just buying a cup of tea. Can become a chore, argument or weird conversation. Just because you tell them, to please not add anything. No sugar, no honey, no stevia, nothing at all. 

I mean I'm all thru out the city and I stop at many different deli's. And it's basically the same thing, I say don't add nothing. Then guess what happens, they end up just automatically adding 3 spoonfuls of sugar and I have to remind them ""hey I can't have sugar"". Or they'll say ""are you sure and why not?"".

Where it literally becomes an annoying task to just get a quick cup of tea. Because the entire world thinks sugar should be added to every drink for flavor automatically. Hoping one day my health can get back to a good space, where if I wanted to can maybe taste a slluce cake or cookie again. But in a responsible and thoughtful manner, where I'm aware of the affects if I overdo it. One thing I'll probably never do again tho, is add some sugar to tea. That just seems pointless to add something unhealthy like sugar, to a drink that's meant to give you health benefits. ",6,1740243401.0,sugarfree,2,0.88,False

There’s been a grand opening in my state and this is being promoted - unsure if this will work for everyone as on my previous post, some people said it worked and some said it didn’t. All three worked for myself though, so just passing along. 

If you can snag the code and keeping, please comment below just so we know who was able to snag one! I’ve already sent the links to friends that have been able to get it as well as the others I posted about.

Rhodes although fun needs amplification, and restoration / maintenance so wonder if there are simpler options or modern alternatives.

It's extremely frustrating when you are your only employee! But it also doesn't allow you to (imo) blame anyone else. Sounds like room for improvement! Ah that makes me excited. Anyway.


So my usual morning routine consists of making coffee, hitting my pen a few times, letting the dog out, feeding the cats. Maybe a bite to eat. Brush teeth, fix hair, ect.

Once all that's done I grab my trusty bag of shipping stuff. Scissors, envelopes, packing tape. And any already packed items I need to ship.

I head to the library, print my labels, and then chill out in my car taping the labels to the envelopes or packages. After they're all labeled and double checked I head to the post office and drop off my packages and head home.

Once I'm home I start my daily inventory, buying/selling process for that day. Which mostly consists of listening items, adjusting prices, and maybe buying more supplies.

Well today I made it to ""I head to the library and print my labels""

I printed 4/5 labels incorrectly. I attached the wrong labels to the library email and only got one I actually needed. It's a cheap mistake if I catch it right here! Which I did. 

So, I saved my merchandise and stores reputation by catching my mistake. But that mistake drained literally all of my motivation. It seemed like the exact second I realized they were the wrong labels everything started getting disorganized in my head. I couldn't find the scissors I was just using, tape kept getting stuck where I didn't want it, paper scraps are flying everywhere as I'm triple checking addresses.

I'm shipping everything after this weekend. I'm going to use the weekend to make some specific folders and digital locations for labels. Set up a physical mail organizer in the kitchen/dining room area, and chill out.


This will go down as my  first bad day of working for myself. The best part was I didn't have to slog through another 7 hours of the day. I just dropped off the one package I got right, and went home. The post office closed at 11 here, and library is still open until 3. If I'm feeling froggy, I'll hop my butt down there and finish what I started.

 I'll live and learn from my mistake. A couple of messed up labels is going to set my income back another 4 or 5 days. At least for these items. Does it hurt? Yes. Is it gonna end my eBay career? No.

1ivmw9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1ivmw9e/was_breaking_up_the_right_thing_to_do/,Was breaking up the right thing to do,"Hi, guys, really need a bit of advice here.
Me (26F) and my ex (29M) broke up five months ago after living together for 3 years. His reason was that I didn’t get on with his friends and he called it a day after we went to the festival and I was hanging out with my friends rather than his friends. The way their group works is girls hang out with girls and guys hang out with guys. The whole friends problem existed for a while - I felt excluded from early on, they didn’t really respect me, unfollowed me on Instagram, would only invite me last minute and wouldn’t come when I invited them. 
Anyway, I was thinking about break up for quite a while as well - I am from Ukraine and couldn’t really freely express myself around him - his family and friends are not anti Russian and it annoyed him I hated Russia so much. One of the sources of tension between me and his friend was that his friend was quite sympathetic towards russians and expressed rather anti Ukrainian thoughts which made me feel uncomfortable. That was my main problem. 
The other thing was it annoyed him that I spoke to my mum so often. I do speak to my mum every day - partly because she lives in Kyiv which is being bombed every night and I am anxious every call might be the last one. He, however, wants more attention from me. I tried giving it to him but we really live on different levels of exhaustion - I work from the office, he works from home, he finishes at 16:00, I finish at 18:00-20:00 depending on the day. He wanted me to leave my jon but I just can’t do that - I love my job too much and I know there is nothing going on in the industry (I work in TV). 
When the war began my mum and my little brother came here to stay with us (not the same house/apartment, just the same town). It surprised me how hostile he was (I thought in a situation like this you could be more welcoming). She needed A LOT of support which I tried to provide but at times it felt like I was being buried under the pile of different tasks which never seemed to end. He didn’t really help and when he offered to help he wouldn’t go through with that. All this annoyed me and I believe I subconsciously developed resentment towards him - I didn’t want any physical intimacy, didn’t want to be around him, felt like he betrayed me in a crisis situation.
I also felt he was often taking advantage of me - we would pay for everything 50/50 even though I earned a lot less and he worked from home, we split extra payment for his dog, he would take my car whenever he pleased and even on one occasion took it to play tennis even though I needed it for work. He would pay for coffee and then request £3 back, he would even let me pay for petrol when my mom picked us ip from an airport. Even now I received a refund as a Ukrainian and he took half of it without conversation (he’s not Ukrainian).
Having said that I recognize that I’m no saint and that he had a lof of good qualities. I think I should have communicated more clearly and maybe some of the issues could have been resolved. At the same time I feel like the situation of my mum requires just basic level of empathy which he failed to show. 
Now looking at the old messages I feel like he cared for me and loved me and maybe break up was a mistake. I never feared he would cheat on me, never suspected him of anything like that, we texted each other good morning and good night, we travelled a lot ( even though I was always the one planning and proposing everything) and I miss his company. He was always calm and almost never angry although sometimes it seemed fake.
I feel like I’ve grown a lot during the past 6 months and that I would have handled a lot of things differently. I am sometimes thinking of asking him if he wants to grab a coffee. 
What do you think?

We started chatting and we found out we had a lot of things in common. I call her on a date and she says yes.

The days leading to the date she said how special I am, how she's lucky to have found me, how she's anxious to meet me, ""where were you this whole time?"" so on and so forth. Ngl I found this to be a little weird because we just met and such, but I ignored it because we had a lot of common and I was really excited for this date.

When the date comes, (Saturday afternoon coffee date) I could see she was really nervous, and I was kind of nervous too, so I tried to make her as comfortable as possible when going out. After leaving the cafeteria, she said she wanted to spend some more time with me. Took her to the city plaza and we cuddled, kissed and just spent the time talking to each other more comfortably. Time goes on and it's night time, do I take her out to dinner.

After dinner she asked if I wanted to go to her place. Mentioned that I had to go buy condoms (I wasn't expecting sex on the first date), she said it's ok because she has condoms back at her place. Alright then.

We went back to her place and start making out, getting naked and touching each other, she's jacking me off. When I'm about to take her panties off, she abruptly grabs my hand, look at me dead in the eye and says

""Sorry, but I'm not on the mood.""

I WAS SO FUCKING CONFUSED. My brain must have done a full tilt because I was speechless for a few seconds trying to find what to say. 

""It's ok."" That's that. I get up and put my underwear back on, she puts back hers, we sit at her couch and just cuddle. We kiss and what not, but nothing beyond that. Spent the night at her place.

Sunday morning I come back home, we still kept chatting, though I noticed she wasn't as present as before. Asked her out again, she said ""not this week I need some alone-time."" And that's when I stopped messaging because I knew she wasn't interested anymore. And I was right, she hasn't sent me anymore messages.

I'm so confused I don't even know how to feel. Angry? Yes. Sad maybe. But overall confused. What the fuck was that? ",1,1740242542.0,Rants,5,1.0,False
1ivmv9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1ivmv9n/was_breaking_up_the_right_decision/,Was breaking up the right decision?,"Hi, guys, really need a bit of advice here.
Me (26F) and my ex (29M) broke up five months ago after living together for 3 years. His reason was that I didn’t get on with his friends and he called it a day after we went to the festival and I was hanging out with my friends rather than his friends. The way their group works is girls hang out with girls and guys hang out with guys. The whole friends problem existed for a while - I felt excluded from early on, they didn’t really respect me, unfollowed me on Instagram, would only invite me last minute and wouldn’t come when I invited them. 
Anyway, I was thinking about break up for quite a while as well - I am from Ukraine and couldn’t really freely express myself around him - his family and friends are not anti Russian and it annoyed him I hated Russia so much. One of the sources of tension between me and his friend was that his friend was quite sympathetic towards russians and expressed rather anti Ukrainian thoughts which made me feel uncomfortable. That was my main problem. 
The other thing was it annoyed him that I spoke to my mum so often. I do speak to my mum every day - partly because she lives in Kyiv which is being bombed every night and I am anxious every call might be the last one. He, however, wants more attention from me. I tried giving it to him but we really live on different levels of exhaustion - I work from the office, he works from home, he finishes at 16:00, I finish at 18:00-20:00 depending on the day. He wanted me to leave my jon but I just can’t do that - I love my job too much and I know there is nothing going on in the industry (I work in TV). 
When the war began my mum and my little brother came here to stay with us (not the same house/apartment, just the same town). It surprised me how hostile he was (I thought in a situation like this you could be more welcoming). She needed A LOT of support which I tried to provide but at times it felt like I was being buried under the pile of different tasks which never seemed to end. He didn’t really help and when he offered to help he wouldn’t go through with that. All this annoyed me and I believe I subconsciously developed resentment towards him - I didn’t want any physical intimacy, didn’t want to be around him, felt like he betrayed me in a crisis situation.
I also felt he was often taking advantage of me - we would pay for everything 50/50 even though I earned a lot less and he worked from home, we split extra payment for his dog, he would take my car whenever he pleased and even on one occasion took it to play tennis even though I needed it for work. He would pay for coffee and then request £3 back, he would even let me pay for petrol when my mom picked us ip from an airport. Even now I received a refund as a Ukrainian and he took half of it without conversation (he’s not Ukrainian).
Having said that I recognize that I’m no saint and that he had a lof of good qualities. I think I should have communicated more clearly and maybe some of the issues could have been resolved. At the same time I feel like the situation of my mum requires just basic level of empathy which he failed to show. 
Now looking at the old messages I feel like he cared for me and loved me and maybe break up was a mistake. I never feared he would cheat on me, never suspected him of anything like that, we texted each other good morning and good night, we travelled a lot ( even though I was always the one planning and proposing everything) and I miss his company. He was always calm and almost never angry although sometimes it seemed fake.
I feel like I’ve grown a lot during the past 6 months and that I would have handled a lot of things differently. I am sometimes thinking of asking him if he wants to grab a coffee. 
What do you think?

1ivmt9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1ivmt9c/amazingly_easy_recovery_so_far_almost_no_pain/,"Amazingly easy recovery so far, almost no pain","I may be an outlier, but I want to share my experience to counter some of the horror stories that I have seen here (which made me freak out and nearly cancel my surgery a few weeks out).  I was most nervous about the few days/weeks postop, but it has been a relative breeze!  I'm so relieved.  

**Day Zero** \- The afternoon after surgery (Wed) I felt totally normal mentally and was getting up and around by myself, reaching for things without a problem, and had almost no pain.  I assumed it was because of lingering anesthesia and the one Percocet I took after surgery (I had sweats and nausea from it so didn't fill the prescription). I worried the next day pain would set in since I was just rotating regular Tylenol and Aleve every 4-5 hours). 

**Day One** \- Nope!  My pain peaked at maybe a 2 on a 10 point scale the next morning (Thurs).  I woke up with tons of energy (despite not a lot of sleep) and made my caretaker coffee.  Friends came by and of course I took it easy and just laid around, but I felt totally normal and was going up and down stairs and changing clothes by myself.  I actually ended up going out to a fancy dinner as I got a last minute invitation I didn't want to turn down and felt OK.  I hid my drains in my pockets and was a bit shaky standing for 20 mins to put on makeup, but it went fine!  In the uber there and back I was a little startled going over bumps and held my boobs gingerly to avoid jostling.  I rationalized that the sea bass I had was a good protein for recovery.  I also skipped Tylenol that night so I could have some wine at dinner.  

**Day Two** \- I still felt fine Friday morning despite having had only one Aleve in the last 15 hours.  I went to the surgeon's office and got my drains out and bandages off.  He said I'm doing great and could stop the Aleve and ditch the wedge pillow whenever I want if I don't have pain.  One spot was leaking slightly so he added some glue.  My mom and I went out to lunch afterwards.  I showered by myself that afternoon and washed my hair.  The water didn't bug me at all (I didn't put it straight on my chest but it dripped down when I washed my hair and face).  That evening we went out to a fancy steak dinner.  

**Day Three** (today)- I haven't taken any meds in 24 hours now, and I'm still pain free (I mean it would hurt I'm sure if I jostled them around or twisted but of course I'm not doing that).  I slept on the wedge pillow again last night but may transition tonight to just regular pillows.  I still feel most comfortable wearing the bra they gave me - I wouldn't call it a compression bra but it gives some support.  There is a bit of pressure / soreness when they just hang as he left some volume, which I requested.  I'm of course taking it easy with very little moving around - easy since it's been below freezing here all week - but I plan to start taking walks tomorrow when it warms up a bit.

Wishing everyone as easy a recovery as possible!  ",7,1740242354.0,Reduction,0,0.82,False

I find that alot of the independent cafes in the area tend to serve what I find to be overly acidic to borderline sour coffee (even after adding dairy). Not burnt just acidic, especially compared to the coffee I make at home (Nespresso). Not only do I find it unpleasant but I find it always really upsets my stomach for the rest of the day. On the flip side, also love spending time doing work at cafes/coffee shops.

The drainage has been going directly in my stomach, not out my nose. And I’ve been coughing a lot. By day 4-5 I had that familiar wave of nausea. No fever, no throwing up, no flu.. I recognized all the gastritis symptoms. Has any one else had a flare up with a common cold? I also had a cold in December where this didn’t happen but maybe the fact that the colds are close together? Ive heard that postnasal drip can irritate the stomach but not sure if gastritis is connected

**Summary:** After falling out with a roommate, your vampire has nowhere to go. Would you let them stay the night?

*(italics)* - Unvoiced notes & stage direction/sounds 
**(…)** - silence for listener response 

**Script Below:**

*(Suggested: Rain in the background throughout)*

*(Knocking on door. Door opens.)*

“Hey, baby. Sorry, I know it’s late. Thanks for letting me come anyway… I didn’t really know where to go after my shift ended tonight…”

“You’re really sweet to say that. I like coming here, of course, but I really can’t ask that of you… Not always at least. But tonight, I *do* really appreciate it… Yeah, it’s uh, stuff with my roommate again. We’ve been arguing. It’s still the whole vampire thing again…”

“My roommate still thinks it’s some kind of weird depressive phase… even if I’m suddenly completely nocturnal and stopped eating our groceries… whatever. I still pay rent. I clean… kind of, as much as I used to at least. I had to switch jobs and everything, totally change up my life- trust me, I wish it were just a weird phase…” 

“Well, yeah… that’s one silver lining. Getting together with you, baby. But I’m not going to put that on me being a vampire. Maybe it’s just wishful thinking, but I liked you before any of this…” 

*(Laughs, a little defensively:)* “Yeah, I get that you like the fangs and the whole vampire mystique, but uh… let’s spare my ego the very hypothetical ‘what ifs…’”

“I being too sensitive about all this stuff. You didn’t even say anything wrong- it’s not you… It really is just this whole thing with my roommate. We used to be, I don’t know, closer? I want to say *friends* but how could we have been friends if they won’t believe me when I say I’m a vampire. 

“I mean, I’d get it at first, I didn’t believe it, but it’s been months. I don’t eat, I can’t be out in the sun, I had to switch my whole life around to accommodate this annoying little *phase*. It took me long enough to find a new job with evening shifts alone. You’d think they’d just be happy for me.” 

“No, you’re right. This isn’t making any of it better… I’m trying not to be so upset about it, it’s just, home just isn’t feeling much like home at the moment.” 

*(Listener hugs speaker.)* 

*(Sigh.)* “It’s so late… there’s no reason you should be up, let alone here, hugging me in your doorway. You’re really so sweet. You know that?” 

“Maybe we could go somewhere more comfortable? You can get back to bed. I’ll just hang out on the couch for a bit, play around on my phone until my roommate has to leave for work. It’s fine… really.” 

“It should still be dark enough by the time they leave that we won’t even have to see each other. I’ll try to figure out some other place to live… honestly, I’m not even really thinking about that all that much yet. I’m just still so shocked it’s gotten this bad. I mean… we were friends…” 

**(…)**

“What? No, you have work in the morning and it’s so late for you… I can’t… oh. Okay-“

*(Shuffling footsteps and door hinges - open, shut. Listener pulls speaker onto a bed.)*

“Hey, wait! I shouldn’t be in your bed. You should be going back to sleep… And I probably still smell like the diner… heh, yeah, it really *is* only slightly worse than the thrift shop smells… Luckily tonight was heavy on the coffee refills, so yeah, that’s uh, mostly what you’re smelling I’m sure.”

“I mean… your bed is really comfortable… you should go back to sleep, but I guess I could um… stay here for a little while… Especially since you’re already kind of snuggled up against me…”

“You want me to take these off? I mean, okay. It would be more comfortable, but hey! Wait- I know that look. You’re supposed to be going back to sleep- and that’s a layer I usually *leave on* for sleep…” 

“Heh, so that’s where your mind went when I said we could *sleep* together… of course it did… you know, I’m not opposed-“

“Oh, umm… you wanted to hold me? Really? But uh… why did I need to take this off then…?  Right… I mean, it does smell like the diner, and uh, while it seems like you’re fine with the smell of burnt coffee, my nose is a little more sensitive these days… thanks for that. I appreciate it.” 

“You don’t even smell like the thrift shop, by the way. I know I was joking before because you *always* do, but you don’t really… like at all. Did you do something..? You showered before bed… wait, you never do that. You- uh, what did you-“

“You showered after I texted you? You didn’t have to do that. Like I said, I’m aware I’ve got my own weird smell from work. That’s um… that was actually just really sweet. Thanks…”

*(Speaker shifts on the bed.)* 

“Is this okay? With my head set here against your chest? Yeah… it’s actually really nice. I was having such a hard night, I thought it was going to just get worse… I mean, I love spending time with you, but I knew you had to sleep and this is just one of those things no one ever tells you about being a vampire. It gets really lonely…”

“So, yeah, it really does mean a lot just being cuddled up in bed with you. Getting to talk to you a little. You still have to get back to sleep, and that’s really alright. I know you need your rest. But is it okay if I just talk for a while? I know you won’t listen to everything but it’s still nice to talk to you… makes me feel less alone.”

“Yeah, you’re right… I’m not alone. Even if you’re asleep, it’s nice to listen your heartbeat. It’s soothing. Makes me kind of feel like I’m not really a vampire at all and I kind just pretend for a few hours that we’re just like any other couple. Because, we are… it’s still just you and me, lying in bed, happy and in love-“

“Wait, sorry. We haven’t exactly ever you know, had that conversation. I shouldn’t assume that you feel… forget I said anything, I’m pretty sure you’re asleep anyway, so we don’t need to talk about that now.”

“You are definitely asleep…” *(Laughs.)* “Well, in that case, no reason to really hold back. I really do love this… Cuddling in bed with you. It’s really just- it’s been a rough few months. Being turned into a vampire, leaving my job at the thrift shop, and then all this with my roommate… but lying here with you, I don’t have to think about that stuff. Back before all this, you were just my work crush… if you smiled at me from the next register over, that was enough for me to obsess over the rest of the day. So, all this… you do so much more for me than you even know.” 

“I’ve been in love with you for months now. And this whole time you’ve just been so cool and levelheaded. You probably already know about how I feel. I’m trying so hard not to be clingy. I was excited enough when you said I should come here tonight because of all this stuff with my roommate. It, uh… gives me hope that maybe one day you’ll want me to just be here all the time.”

“I know it’s too soon for us to move in together or anything like that, but is it so terrible that I really don’t care to look for anywhere else to live? I love you and I want to just stay here with you…” 

“Huh? Are you awake? *Shoot,* of course that’s the part you wake up for… sorry, baby. Ignore me. I’m happy. You just go back to sleep. It’s not important.” 

*(Laughs nervously.)* “Let’s just hope you’re too sleepy to really remember any of that by tomorrow… it’s not like I don’t want you to know how I feel or anything. I do.

I am no longer hurt when we talk about relationships but she keeps reminding me about her birthday coming up.

When we were together, she would drop hints like this and expects that I do something. Even on Valentines she called me and greeted me even though she is my ex. It felt like she expects something from me even though she has a bf. And so I sent her a cup of coffee that day. She called again and told me how much she appreciated it so much.

I’m not sure if she really is expecting something from me but I have that sense as she was like that when we were together.

Last year, she gave me a wonderful gift for my birthday. Something I will mever forget since we were together.that is why I thought I should do something.

So now I am wondering, should I do something or give something for her birthday because I feel like I might be a bad person if I do not do or give anything at all? I am friends  with her but am I being stupid ?",0,1740241875.0,Advice,12,0.5,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ivml0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1ivml0n/deep_pit_and_fissure_cavity_not_visible_on_xray/,Deep pit and fissure cavity not visible on X-Ray? How is that possible?,"I have always been fortunate with my teeth and never had a cavity until I was 42 (currently 47). After that I was determined to not get any more so have taken really good care of my teeth - I brush twice a day with a soft toothbrush, a few times a week with Prevident, a few times a week with carifree, and the rest of the time just regular toothpaste and floss every night. No smoking, one cup of coffee a day, always rinse with water after I finish and chew xylitol gum. I began invisalign two years ago and occasionally use MI paste in my trays overnight since I know Invisalign makes me more at risk (I also started a medication that gives me dry mouth so another risk factor).

Six months ago I was told by my dentist that I had two cavities in my top two left molars (I think 14 and 15?). They were not visible at all on an xray but only visual examination. I asked if there was a possibility of remineralization and she said no, but I opted to watch and wait six months and see if I could. 6 months later, new dentist (I go to a dental residency program so have a new one every year), same thing - nothing shows up on xrays, but she notes the two cavities. I ask her about arresting them if not remineralizing them and she says it's too risky with this type of cavity so I decide to get the fillings.

When she goes in to do the fillings, she says that they are very deep and I made the right choice as if I'd waited much longer I could have ended up with a root canal. I had no pain at all before these fillings but now, two weeks later, my teeth are very sensitive when chewing. I realize that I made a mistake by waiting six months as I've now read that pit and fissure cavities are not good candidates for a ""watch and wait"" approach, but my main question is: **how can I have had such deep decay not visible on an xray?** Unfortunately I don't have a picture of my xrays but I did take photos of the molars before they were filled. What am I missing? Will the pain when chewing go away? Am I doomed to eventually need two root canals?

\*\*\*\*\*\*Must add that my baby dentist looked like she was about 25 years old and that only adds to my fears. She took a very, very long time drilling and filling, which I hope means she was trying to get everything perfect and not that she didn't know what she was doing. She's not a student but a resident in a year-long specialty program. I've always been happy to go to this practice since I know people have to learn somewhere but that was when I didn't have any problems with my teeth. Help!

What do you think my chances of getting an offer are? :

A bit of context is that I legitimately thought I was doing well (I am always constantly asking for more work, getting the assigned work papers done, staying late to help out the team, participated in activities/ actively networked, and taking orders/coffee runs)… Generally I thought I was getting along with my team well! I met with my career coach and received some feedback which kind of made me nervous. Which heavily emphasized taking feedback and showing your growth from it which was something that I thought I was doing.

My first point was that I am genuinely very positive. But then we got into the negatives about things like organization, question asking, which were heavily emphasized, stating that I need to use these last couple weeks to really show improvement for an offer. Which I thought I have been doing, but it seems to not be showing. I feel 50/50 about everything which is upsetting since I worked so hard and sacrificed a lot to be here.

Am I cooked? Think I should look for other jobs?

Hey all,

So I’m new to the whole Reddit thing so please forgive me if this is laid out weird it’s my first post.

I 26(M) have a wife 24(F). We have been together for 5 years and married since September 2023 (Canada.) 

For context 2 years into the relationship I discovered messages between her and the AP. These messages were NSFW and definitely something somebody (in my opinion) should not be sharing with someone outside of the relationship. After I discovered the messages we had a whole argument about it and decided to attend couples counselling in mid 2023. My wife had told me in front of the therapist. That I needed to get over my insecurities with AP (I had blown up on her after the first messages were discovered and told her to end the cheating, she said they did and I was reading to far into it.) And so I dropped my concerns about AP.

She’s never been one to give me her phone passwords saying she needs her privacy and I should trust her. But I was recently out of town and received a message from her sister asking if she knew about a guy in my home (not AP) I replied to her no I did not and immediately called my wife asking about the stranger in our home. Her response was less than ideal screaming at me that I didn’t trust her and who she brought into our home was none of my concern. 

This got me thinking that there is more to this, so I did some digging, I found out her phone password and went through her messages and there it was. Messages between her and AP about seeing each other. They called their meet ups “going for coffee” I’m not going to go into details about the messages but it was enough for me to say I’ve had enough.

I know I haven’t been perfect in our relationship. I got complacent and relaxed. And I pushed hard to try and re kindle our sex life. But I’ve had enough.

My question to you is, AP has a fiancé and a child at home (2 months old.) I’ve contacted a family law firm to schedule a consultation and I plan on moving on with divorce proceedings. But my question is when should I tell this poor woman. She didn’t ask for this and deserves to know. However my wife doesn’t know that I know about the affair and I don’t want to blow this entire thing up yet to try and help with my divorce. 

Thanks for any input you may have that could help or at least help get my mind straight again.

Update : hi all it’s me again. Sorry for the amount of time that it took to update you all. It’s been a crazy year. I’ve had a birthday go past and so is she? I’m not gonna go into too many details, but I’m just gonna let you all know that we have separated and according to the laws where I live people have to be separated for a year before they can finalize the divorce so I’m just waiting now for that year to pass. That way I can get my lawyer to finalize those documents thank you for all the support and I hope you all have a good day.",29,1740241581.0,survivinginfidelity,12,0.97,False

I was hired in October 2024 as a seasonal barista and will be regularized in April 2025. Since joining, I’ve been deeply committed to both service excellence and coffee education, frequently leading coffee tastings with partners and at various stores where I’ve been assigned.

My shift supervisor and barista trainer have been encouraging me to pursue the Coffee Master program after my regularization, and I’m eager to take that next step. As a partner in the Philippines, I’d love to hear insights from those who have undergone the process—particularly regarding the timeline and any steps I can take to further prepare.

I plan on making a stand because I have a bunch of scrap wood and am fairly handy.  My main question regards HEIGHT.  I have such a wicked case of ADHD I'll likely never be weaving in the same spot twice.  I'm sure I'll be in the living room on the couch (with proper back alignment, fear not!), at the kitchen table, in my room with a cup of coffee, outside, watching the kids, etc.  Do those of you with the standard stand ever feel the need for adjustable heights?    
Pros:  I could set up in more places without worrying about ergonomics and it would be easier to fit in a carry bag the same size as my loom  
Cons:  Overengineering fun.

1ivmbya,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1ivmbya/how_i_discovered_my_genetic_risk_for_type_2/,How I Discovered My Genetic Risk for Type 2 Diabetes and How I Manage It,"# Hi! I'd like to share my journey with prediabetes with you, just in case it can help other people!

I am 32 male and live in the UK. In December 2023, I started feeling constantly fatigued and noticed some skin-related symptoms. I decided to visit my doctor, who ran some tests, including **HbA1c**, which came back at **42 mmol/mol**. My doctor was not particularly concerned, as he said this was very borderline in the UK, but I wanted to understand what was happening, so I began investigating.

# Using a Continuous Glucose Monitor to Identify Sugar Spikes

To gain insight into how my body processed glucose, I started using a **Freestyle Libre 2 continuous glucose monitor (CGM)**. The data revealed that while my **fasting glucose** was generally stable (around 5.8 mmol/L), certain foods caused significant blood sugar spikes that lasted for hours. My glucose levels would rise sharply, then drop, then rise again, creating multiple peaks rather than a smooth return to baseline. Some notable examples included:

* **Fried potatoes (chips, fries):** Spiked up to **12 mmol/L**, with glucose remaining elevated for hours.
* **Rice, quinoa, pasta, and white bread:** Caused multiple high fluctuations.
* **A McDonald's meal:** Reached approximately **12 mmol/L**, with prolonged elevation.
* **A meal consisting of a white bread sandwich, a bag of crisps, and apple juice:** Also resulted in a **12 mmol/L spike**, followed by multiple fluctuations before stabilising.

I asked my parents to wear a CGM as well, and interestingly, my mother’s glucose levels behaved differently. She experienced **lower and shorter-lived spikes, with a much quicker return to baseline**, indicating more efficient glucose regulation. This made me question why my body responded so differently to carbohydrates.

# Lowering My HbA1c Through Lifestyle Changes

In response to these findings, I significantly reduced my intake of **high-glycaemic carbohydrates** and made several dietary and lifestyle changes:

* **Focusing on vegetables, lean protein (chicken, turkey), fish (wild salmon, sardines, mackerel, herring), legumes** (lentils) **healthy fats** (avocado, extra virgin olive oil) and other things such as **bulgur**, which I found did not cause high glucose spikes.
* **Not eating any ultra-processed food and avoiding pasta, rice, quinoa, potatoes, sweets, refined flour, seed oils, preservatives, etc.**
* Drinking green tea, sparkling water and coffee, not other drinks. I also drink soy milk and don't consume dairy except some kefir.
* **Strength training (3-4 times per week) and swimming (2-3 times per week)** to improve insulin sensitivity.
* Using supplements to improve my sleep and stress (see below).

After several months of implementing these changes, I lost 7kg of fat, gained muscle mass, slept better, my triglycerides levels went down, with good cholesterol up and bad down, and my **HbA1c dropped to 37 mmol/mol**. However, when I became less strict with my diet—occasionally having a croissant with a latte or other refined carbohydrates—my next blood test showed that **HbA1c had risen back to 42 mmol/mol**.

This made me realise that my body is less capable of processing carbohydrates correctly because other people around me would have a worse lifestyle than me and were not prediabetic. I wanted to understand the underlying cause, and I remembered that both my grandmothers had type 2 diabetes.  so I had my **DNA sequenced through 23andMe**.

# Genetic Findings: Why My Body Handles Glucose Differently

I got my DNA sequenced with 23andMe, downloaded the raw data, converted it into a CSV file and investigated with the help of medicine articles and AI. The genetic analysis revealed that I have **several key variants that impact pancreatic function, insulin secretion, and glucose metabolism**, increasing my risk of developing **type 2 diabetes**. These include:

# 1. TCF7L2 (rs7903146) – The Most Significant Risk Factor

* **Genotype:** CT (one risk allele, T)
* **Effect: This gene is one of the strongest known genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes.**
* **Mechanism:** TCF7L2 plays a crucial role in the **Wnt signalling pathway**, which regulates insulin production in the pancreas. The **T allele** is associated with **reduced insulin secretion**, meaning that after consuming carbohydrates, my pancreas is slower to release insulin, leading to **higher and more prolonged blood sugar spikes**.
* **Risk:** Those with this variant are at significantly increased risk of developing insulin resistance, especially when consuming refined carbohydrates.

# 2. PPARG (rs1801282) – Reduced Insulin Sensitivity

* **Genotype:** CC (no protective Pro12Ala variant)
* **Effect:** PPARG regulates **fat metabolism and insulin sensitivity**.
* **Mechanism:** This gene is involved in **storing and metabolising fats**, which plays a role in how the body responds to insulin. The **CC genotype** means I lack the **Pro12Ala protective variant**, which helps improve insulin sensitivity. As a result, **my cells are less efficient at using insulin**, requiring more to achieve the same glucose-lowering effect.

# 3. SLC30A8 (rs13266634) – Impaired Zinc Transport in the Pancreas

* **Genotype:** CC (two risk alleles)
* **Effect:** This gene encodes a **zinc transporter (ZnT8)** that is critical for insulin packaging and secretion.
* **Mechanism:** Zinc is essential for insulin stability, and the **CC genotype is associated with impaired insulin granule formation**. This can lead to **inefficient insulin release**, contributing to glucose dysregulation. **Since I already have a tendency for lower zinc levels, this further exacerbates the problem.** I had been aware of the importance of taking zinc for a while now. It’s one of those supplements that, when I first started taking it, I noticed significant improvements in my skin, sleep, and various other aspects of my well-being.

**4. HHEX (rs1111875) – Beta-Cell Dysfunction**

* **Genotype:** TT (two risk alleles)
* **Effect:** This gene is involved in pancreatic beta-cell development.
* **Mechanism:** The **TT genotype** is linked to **reduced beta-cell function**, meaning my pancreas may struggle to produce enough insulin over time, increasing the risk of glucose intolerance.

# 5. WFS1 (rs10010131) – Glucose Regulation Issues

* **Genotype:** GG (two risk alleles)
* **Effect:** This gene affects the survival of pancreatic beta cells.
* **Mechanism:** Variants in **WFS1** have been associated with **poorer glucose metabolism and increased risk of beta-cell dysfunction**, making blood sugar regulation less efficient.

# 6. MTHFR (C677T) – Impaired Folate Metabolism and Insulin Resistance

* **Effect:** This mutation affects folate metabolism, reducing the ability to convert folic acid into its active form (**methylfolate**).
* **Link to Diabetes:** Impaired folate metabolism is associated with **higher homocysteine levels**, which increases **inflammation and insulin resistance**.

# How I Manage My Blood Sugar and Reduce Risk now

Based on these findings, I have implemented several strategies to stabilise blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity:

# 1. Diet - All I have mentioned above

* **Focusing on low-glycaemic carbohydrates** such as **bulgur, wholemeal rye bread, and legumes** instead of refined carbs.
* **Pairing carbohydrates with protein and healthy fat** to slow glucose absorption.
* Eating lots of vegetables and some fruit which doesn't spike me. 
* **Avoiding high-GI foods** such as white rice, pasta, and potatoes,  **ultra-processed food**, dairy and seed oils. 
* **Eating fermented foods (e.g., kefir)** to support gut health, which is linked to insulin sensitivity.

# 2. Supplements

* **Folate (methylated form)** due to MTHFR mutation.
* **Cinnamon** for improved glucose metabolism.
* **Zinc** for insulin production (particularly important due to my SLC30A8 variant).
* **Magnesium** for insulin sensitivity.
* **Melatonin (2mg) to improve sleep.**
* **5HTP to improve sleep and mood.**
* **Apple cider vinegar before carbohydrate-heavy meals** to lower postprandial blood sugar spikes.
* **Ashwagandha** to reduce cortisol-related insulin resistance.
* **Sulforaphane (with myrosinase and yellow mustard)** for glucose metabolism (without these co-factors, sulforaphane causes me bloating).
* **I'm currently considering Gymnema Sylvestre** to reduce sugar cravings.

# 3. Exercise and Stress Management

* **Strength training and swimming** to improve insulin sensitivity and build muscle, hoping it will help me regulate sugar better.
* **Managing stress levels**, as high cortisol can contribute to insulin resistance.

With supplements and food, it has been 3 years of trial and error, so I have tried to use my genetic information to try the best supplements according to what doesn't work or is missing in my metabolism, and that list is what I found works the best for me. Everyone is different and I would encourage you to do your investigation!

# Conclusion

Although my genetic predisposition increases my risk of type 2 diabetes, my **dietary, exercise, and supplement interventions have successfully prevented prediabetes**. This experience has reinforced the importance of **understanding individual metabolic responses** and tailoring lifestyle choices accordingly. By working with my genetics rather than against them, I can maintain stable blood sugar levels and long-term metabolic health. Sometimes, it is a bit difficult to accept that you are different and are not 'made' for the environment you live in (as I can't go now and eat a pizza with friends or a piece of cake, I don't drink anymore, etc) and follow what the majority of people do. However, I feel better than ever and feel that I am understanding who I am and becoming free. We are all different and when medicine moves forward and is more tailored, we will all learn what we need to do and what is best for ourselves!",12,1740241125.0,prediabetes,1,0.88,False

I present to you: Chapter One of the Let the Old Dreams Die AU, ACT 1!","#            Chapter One: Smoke and Mirrors

October 6th, 2023. The last couple of hours have been eventful, to say the least. From the incident at Claire’s mansion to Niamoi being turned, and now this: They are on the road again. They only left an hour ago. I guess it does take a long time to get from Manhattan to Long Island. It was quiet for a while. No one really talked to each other. Mark was driving, and Niamoi sat in the front seat, not saying anything either. Isaiah was silent, probably sleeping. And then there was Eleanor, sitting in the back of the car, looking out the window as they passed by the stone murals and vines that lined the walls of the highway. “...Dad? How long have we been driving?”  Eleanor asked.  Mark didn’t reply, he didn’t hear her. Too locked in on getting the hell out of dodge. Eleanor looked at Isaiah, who was still snoozing nearby. Eleanor simply stared at him for a while. She couldn’t help but feel horrible for him. His mother was turned, all because of them. And yet, *he still loved her. Why?* Eleanor couldn’t help but wonder why. He was her first lover, not her first friend, but her old friends have all probably grown up and forgotten about her by now. She had to cut contact with them all since she turned, but now she had Isaiah. And He had her. They were perfect for each other in all aspects. But even after *everything* that transpired, he still stuck around. He never forgotten her. Sure, he was in a bad funk a few days ago, who wouldn’t be? Someone you love gets turned into a monster. And now, they’ll probably be stuck with each other for the foreseeable future.  “...What’s up?” Isaiah asked quietly. Eleanor snapped out of her trance, noticing that Isaiah was awake. “N-Nothing… how are you holding up?” Eleanor whispered. Isaiah shook his head. “...I still think this is just a dream. But it’s all real..” Eleanor sighed, before hugging Isaiah. “...I know I don’t say this often, but I love you. I love you so much… You're strong. Stronger than I could ever be.” Isaiah chuckled, he hadn’t done that much since what happened, it made Eleanor smile. “Mentally or Physically?” Isaiah asked jokingly. Eleanor laughed. “You know what I mean..” Isaiah chuckled. “But you're strong too, don’t forget that.”  Eleanor smiled, feeling a rush of happiness. “Yeah, you're right... I am.” 



Naomi, who has been quiet this whole time, listened to the conversation the two children were having in the back. They had a point. They had to be strong during all this. No matter what. She looked into the window before her, seeing just the road in front of them. But then she looked up into the sky and saw something. It looked like a bird. But it looked far too big to be a normal one. The biggest bird on earth that could fly was The Snowy Albatross. But even then, those weren’t native to Long Island. It left behind behind a faint, ethereal trail resembling falling stardust. “...Do you think we should pull over somewhere? Maybe a gas station? We’ve been on the road for a while.” Naomi suggested. Mark sighed. “I don’t want to risk it.” Naomi looked in the rearview mirror. There wasn’t anything suspicious back there. “Let’s just halt for a second. We’re not too far away from our destination, and I could use the walk.” Naomi suggested. Mark sighed. “Alright, fine. We can stop for a bit. But not for long.” 

 It didn't take them long to find a nearby 7-Eleven gas station. As they stepped out of the car, Mark noticed something unusual. In front of the 7-Eleven sat a German Shepherd. The dog was calmly staring at them as if waiting for someone. Isaiah reached out to pet the dog, but Naomi intervened. ""No, don’t,"" she warned. The dog seemed to glare at her as if offended by her refusal.

The group walked into the convenience store. Luckily, it wasn’t too busy, and no one noticed them. They were just minding their own business. “Do we need anything in particular?” Eleanor asked. Mark shook his head. 

The cold fluorescent lights inside the 7-Eleven hummed softly as the group stepped in. The store smelled like stale coffee and frozen burritos, starkly contrasting the cool night air outside. Eleanor scanned the aisles, her fingers brushing against a rack of snack cakes, but her mind was elsewhere. The dog outside still bothered her. The way it just sat there, staring at the open road. It was if it was waiting for something, or someone. Isaiah stuck close to her side, his hands stuffed into his hoodie pocket. “Feels weird to be in a normal place after everything, huh?” he muttered.

Eleanor nodded. “Yeah… like none of this should exist after what happened.”

Mark, meanwhile, was at the front counter, paying for a few bottles of water. Naomi hovered near the doorway, eyes flicking back and forth between the shelves and the gas station windows. She still couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. That bird—or whatever it was—hadn’t been normal. Neither was the dog.

“Alright, let’s move,” Mark said, stuffing a receipt into his jacket pocket. “We’re not staying here all night.”

As they turned to leave, a man entered the store. He was tall, with graying hair and a tired expression. He wore a dark brown sweatshirt, the fabric looking slightly damp from the evening mist. The hood was on over his head. His skin had bandages on him, and his eyes looked slightly red. But it wasn’t his appearance that made Naomi tense—it was the way he looked at them. Not just a passing glance, but a lingering, knowing stare.

Eleanor felt her stomach twist. Isaiah must have sensed it, too, because he subtly moved closer to her, his hand brushing against hers. “Good Evening, "" the man said, his voice quiet and monotone.

Eleanor gave the man a small, cautious nod, trying to ignore the unsettling feeling gnawing at her gut. There was something off about him, something that felt wrong, but she couldn’t put her finger on it. Isaiah squeezed her hand as if sensing her unease. Naomi shifted slightly, moving closer to the door, her eyes narrowing. Mark, oblivious to the tension, walked toward the exit, already lost in his thoughts. 

“Evening,” Naomi muttered, offering a tight smile as she gave the man a quick once-over. She could feel his eyes linger on her, a strange intensity behind them like he was measuring her, calculating something. She didn’t like it.

The man didn’t seem phased by the awkward silence. He moved past Naomi, his presence suddenly seeming to fill the space around them. He shuffled down the aisle toward the refrigerated section, but as he did, Eleanor noticed something odd. The faint, almost imperceptible stench of decay seemed to follow him—a scent so subtle it could’ve been imagined, but it made her skin crawl nonetheless.

Naomi’s hand instinctively reached for the door handle, her muscles tense. She wasn’t sure what it was, but there was something familiar about the man. A sense of dread crept over her, a feeling that this was no ordinary stranger.

“Let’s get out of here,” Naomi said under her breath, her voice barely audible.

Mark was already out the door, not hearing Naomi’s warning, and the others followed quickly behind him. Eleanor cast one last glance at the man, who was now selecting a drink, his back turned to them. She could’ve sworn his head twitched for just a moment like he had sensed her gaze, but she couldn’t be sure.

The door jingled as they stepped outside, the cool night air hitting their faces. Mark began walking toward the car without another word, but Naomi hung back, just for a moment.

“I’ve got a bad feeling about him,” Naomi murmured to Eleanor, her voice low but intense. “He’s... not what he seems.”

Eleanor nodded, her throat tight. ""Yeah, I noticed it too.” As they walked back to the car, the sound of the man’s voice echoed faintly from inside the store, though the door was closed. The words were barely distinguishable, but the tone was chillingly familiar.

""Not for much longer... “ Isaiah glanced over at Eleanor, his eyes filled with concern. “What do you think he meant by that? Before Eleanor could answer, Mark opened the car door and gestured for everyone to get in. Naomi slid into the front passenger seat, her eyes scanning the dark road ahead. She glanced in the side mirror one last time. The dog was still sitting in front of the 7-Eleven, watching them. Its gaze seemed to follow them as they pulled away, but the moment they turned the corner, it was gone. Disappeared into the night.

“Let’s just get to the house,” Mark muttered, the unease settling into his voice. But Eleanor couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted. The world, it seemed, had grown even darker, and whatever that man was, they were closer to the heart of something far more sinister than they had anticipated. But as they drove out of the parking lot, another car nearby started, a Navy Blue 1958 Plymouth Fury. The headlights quickly turned on and shifted as the group drove away, with the Plymouth following quietly behind. 

*Not too far now.* The road to the house wasn’t too far, just a few more stops. Eventually, the car had to stop at a stoplight. When they stopped, someone on a motorcycle halted next to them, waiting for the light to turn green. But when Mark looked over, they were clad in full armor. The figure looked over and waved. When the light turned green, they quickly took off. Before Mark said anything, something told him to check his side view mirror. When he did, he noticed the Plymouth Fury waiting behind them. He saw it pull out earlier, and at first, he thought it was going the same route as them, but now, it was clear that whoever was driving it was following them. Mark didn’t know if it was one of Claire’s men following them in an unmarked vehicle, or someone else somehow after Eleanor, but to avoid detection, Mark took a detour, down a different road through a forest to the house.

Eleanor quickly noticed how dark it was as they drove through the woods. Sure, they were on a road, but trees surrounded them. Even with her enhanced vampire sight, she couldn’t tell what was in the forest. But she could hear running with her enhanced hearing, along with barking and snarling. Naomi heard it all too. Sure, she was new to being a vampire, but she had all the senses a vampire would have. Eventually, Eleanor heard something coming into the way of the car. “DAD STOP!” Eleanor shouted. Mark slammed down on the brake as a deer ran out into the road, but it looked weird. Despite how fast it ran across the road, followed by a pack of wolves, both animals looked different and odd. The deer looked like it was a plastic hunting decoy of a deer, complete with artificial fur and visible bullet holes riddling its torso. Its eyes were black, with tears going down them. The legs glowed blue along with the antlers. The wolves had exaggerated proportions—elongated limbs, too many teeth, and eyes that glowed a deep, burning red. Their fur appears fractured in places, almost like a glitch in reality, with dark void-like patches where flesh should be. The animals passed by the car in a blur. “...What was that?” Isaiah asked. Mark shrugged. “I.. I don’t know. What’s more important is getting to our destination. Let’s just go.” Mark started the car up and drove, as The Hollow Stag watched the car leave.

It took them a bit to exit the forest but around 10 pm they reached the street, however, while they were driving down the road to the house, the Man on the Motorcycle was in front of them. From behind, Mark could see he had a cape on. The figure turned left, going somewhere else. Mark shrugged it off and got to the house that they would stay at. It was a medium-sized house. The lights were on in the living room, probably the son was home. There was a hay bale sitting in the front yard. Mark stepped out. “Alright, come on, let's get started, we don’t have all night.” Eleanor looked over at Isaiah, who clearly looked really sleep-deprived. The last couple of hours were hectic, especially for him. Thankfully, they didn’t take too much with them, as they had to leave fast. “Dad? Can I take Isaiah inside? He looks like he’s going to pass out.” Eleanor suggested. Isaiah didn’t reply, he was just so tired.

Mark sighed. “Alright, come, let me open the door.” As the four walked to the gate, Eleanor could hear barking coming from the house. She could see a small Chihuahua barking in the window, as two larger, more deeper ones barked with equal volume.

Upon opening the side door and going down the grey carpet stairs, was their new home. A basement. There wasn’t really any furniture, except for one couch and an old box TV sitting on a stool. “Well, it’s not much, but it works..” Mark whispered. Eleanor scooped up Isaiah and placed him on the couch. “Sleep well…”

1ivm7oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ivm7oj/nui_cobalt_bees_are_coming_36_reviews_from_past/,Nui Cobalt Bees are coming! 36 reviews from past years,"Hello folks, I'm back with a new pre-collection-release post! Nui Cobalt's Bees collection will be returning this Friday, February 28. 🐝🐝🐝

Each year I literally count down the days to this release - Nui Cobalt Bees represent the start of spring for me. This collection has so much delicacy, airiness, honey-sweetness, and, of course, its stunning florals (and some darker, more resinous scents too, for folks who love those). For anybody who is newish to indies, Nui Cobalt's Bees collection features honey in various different forms (whipped, spiced, floral blossom-tinged) and I can say from experience that even if honey notes from other houses don't work on you, it's very well worth giving these a try. Honey can be a difficult note in perfume, often smelling like cat pee (with which it shares several chemical compounds), but NCD's don't have that problem. They've said outright that they create ""fantasy"" honey accords that evoke the smell and idea of honey but without the urine-like elements. Personally their white whipped honey is my favorite! But all of their honey accords - and they have at least four or five different ones - are all really special. And along with the Bees comes the smaller partner collection, Nui's Favorite Things, and we often still get at least one remnant of the very-long-ago collection Celtic Treasures (from which **Liquid Luck** hails).

This review post surveys all 36 of the Bees and Favorite Things that I've been delighted to try. Sadly, some of them have been discontinued (I live in hope that **Honeymoon Suite** may someday recur!) but I'll still list all the ones I've tried here, to make this a more helpfully comprehensive resource in case if you find any older Bees in the swaps and are curious to read some thoughts on them. I'd love to hear if any of these catch your eye - what are you most hoping will return this year?

Many of these were provided as press samples in past years in exchange for honest reviews.

\~\~\~

# Celtic Treasures

**Liquid Luck** \[A gorgeously green bouquet of night air and dewy grass, charmed galbanum and benzoin, Irish moss, carrot seed, living shamrock and freshly turned earth\] - Grass, clover, and carrot tops. It's very green, fresh, herbal, earthy, and a touch sweet without being at all sugary. It ended up being much too green for me, but I also think it helped to bring me some good luck, as I was wearing it a lot a few years ago on house tours when we were trying to buy our first house.

# Bees

**Ancient Apiary** \[Deadfall draped in oakmoss, wild pink roses, honeycomb bursting from frail brood boxes and pouring gold from every cell\] - When applied, something about the combination of ""deadfall"" and ""brood boxes"" with honey veritably screams ""COLA!"" (It actually made me mistakenly think there was frankincense in this blend, which there isn't, at least not among the listed notes.) Happily, as soon as it begins drying, the almost-incensey woody notes and the honey disentangle, bringing in a faint undertone of roses and the dusty, almost mossy green of the oakmoss. This perfume feels lush but also vintage, like a sepia-toned photograph.

**Bee Kind To Yourself** \[White copal, blooming peony, honeyed tea, pink amber, and sheer summer-weight cashmere\] - First off, I absolutely have to give credit to our very own, amazing [u/propheticperfumes](https://www.reddit.com/u/propheticperfumes/), who suggested this scent to Nui Cobalt. It's a stunner both in its concept and execution (and it quickly became a crowd favorite here at IMAM). On application, it's a delicately floral-tinged honey; and definitely a liquid golden honey rather than the airier, whiter whipped honey of **Queen Bee**. I get a lot of honey and an overlay of pink peony at this stage. Once **Bee Kind To Yourself** reaches its full expression, it's gorgeous. As it dries, the copal smoke and musky woolly cashmere emerge to join the honey and peony, and if I look for it, I can even find a hint of tea. I had thought this would be a summer perfume for me (though the musk is a little too *heavy* for summer, when I prefer more freshness and lightness), but by happy chance, I happened to wear it for yoga one day - it was *phenomenal* as a yoga perfume and I still have no idea why, but it has remained in the yoga section of my perfume collection ever since.

**Bee Not Afraid** \[Angelic incense, cirrus clouds, glowing beeswax candles, bedstraw, and honey gathered from an ancient cathedral hive\] Oh gosh, I love Nui Cobalt's cathedral incense *so much*. If you've tried **Gargoyle**, **The Mentor**, or **Sacred Space**, you know what I mean - it's warm and fragrant and rich without being charred or smoky. Here it's paired with a glowing honey-beeswax, both notes complimenting and reinforcing one another, but (as is the case with all NCD honeys) not at all urinous. Nor is it super sweet, just unctuous honey and solemn, ritualistic beeswax. If you like the honey in **Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy** (see below), this honey strikes me as very similar. I'm always wary of straw/hay notes, but here the straw melds so beautifully into the honey-beeswax and lends a little extra warmth, much like the wheat does in **Poesie Amaterasu** \[Golden sandalwood incense, rice milk, bright cardamom, amber, dry wheat, and sunflowers\]. Knowing how much I love their cathedral incense, and trusting their deft hand with honey, I blind-bought a FS of this when it was released last year and I'm just overjoyed that I did. When I wear this, it's usually as an evening scent.

**Bee You Tiful** \[Honey-roasted pistachio and chestnut, pink magnolia, and sweet apple blossom\] - Honeyed-salty-toasty nuts harmonizing with the florals, particularly the apple blossom. Nui Cobalt has a *gorgeous* apple blossom note; see also **Pixie** \[An apple orchard in bloom, spring grasses alive with an unearthly glow, vanilla bean offertory cakes, and sparkling honey mead\] and **Venus Amica** \[Sun-warmed wildflowers, olivewood, apple blossom, light amber, moringa leaf, and sacred benzoin\]. The honey, pistachio, and faint apple combine in **Bee You Tiful** to be reminiscent of some sort of delightful pastry - is a pistachio-apple galette a thing? And yet this isn't a realistic gourmand, especially with the wafting florals making it much more atmospheric. The overall impression is of a garden party. Many hours later, the top-note florals are gone, but the gentle nuts remain. If you like the pistachio in **Akhal-Teke** \[Fine ecru suede, raw silk, pearl musk, white amber, precious Hawaiian sandalwood, and creamy pistachio\], you should definitely try this one.

**The Beekeeper's Funeral** \[This comforting blend opens with gentle Bulgarian lavender and petrichor, then blooms with Casablanca lily, honeysuckle, and wet grass, and settles at last into a pillow of fluffy whipped honey\] - A very pretty, understated floral-aquatic. I get white florals (but not too bold), an herbal lavender, grass, and rain - this petrichor is more the smell of the watery rain itself rather than wet pavement. Oddly enough for this being a Bee, I actually don't get any honey, though there is a little bit of sweetness that reminds me of the white amber in **Mirror** \[Pale amber and white tea are accented by dry coconut, angelica, and cooling rain\], in part because of the shared rain note.

**Bees' Cotillion** \[Succulent pears simmering in spring honey with the gentlest breeze of lily carried in a homespun infusion of honeysuckle flowers\] - This one makes me depressed because my skin chemistry is the actual worst and turns this beautiful notes list into straight-up craft store candle. I really can't wear NCD's pear, apricot notes, or honeysuckle notes. Other glowing reviews say this scent is just *lovely*, but on me it goes straight Yankee Candle.

**The Bees' Carnival** \[Cotton candy spun from crystallized honey, fresh leaves of lemon verbena, blue raspberry drizzle, and a grounding smolder of sweet myrrh\] - This one shouts COTTON CANDY and a lot of honey, with only mere hints of the lemon and blue raspberry. If you love the cotton candy of **Nephophilia** \[A fluffy melange of pink cotton candy, ivory cashmere, silk tree blossoms, blush suede, and steamed vanilla\] but wanted it to have even more cotton candy, **The Bees' Carnival** is for you! Other scents in this family are **Scoundrel: Blue Cotton Candy** \[Our blue cotton candy accord is spun from silken tonka, Mexican vanilla bean, sparkling sugar, marshmallow fluff, preserved Damson plum, and barely a twinkle of unripe bergamot\] (which isn't so much ""blue raspberry""), and **Land of Sweets** \[Sugared rose petals, blue cotton candy, miniature marshmallows, pistachio ice cream, and a drizzle of white chocolate\] (which is mostly sugared rose on a bed of gourmand sweets). I always expect a more distinct blue raspberry note in **The Bees' Carnival**, but happily I do have **Blue Moon** \[A diaphanous lunar musk entwines living honeysuckle and sugared blue raspberry\] and **Dewdrops on Spidersilk** \[Cerulean strands of cotton flower bejeweled with dewdrops, cold crystalline musk, tiny black vanilla beans, frozen blue raspberry, and gentle incense\] to scratch that itch. The herbal quality of the lemon verbena and the slight earthiness of the myrrh come out in the drydown, keeping the really golden nature of this honey from becoming too cloying.

**The Bees' High Tea** \[Delicate vanilla cakes with rose petal preserves, elderflower wine, and Earl Grey tea with a dainty drop of spring harvest honey\] - This one is *so much fun*: a grapey rose jam and fizzy champagne, with a hint of vanilla coming out as it dries. Wearing it makes me feel like I'm attending an elegant summer brunch, or perhaps I'm a picnicker with Emma Woodhouse on Box Hill. It is lovely, feminine and playful. If you've tried **Pixie** \[An apple orchard in bloom, spring grasses alive with an unearthly glow, vanilla bean offertory cakes, and sparkling honey mead\], **Bees' High Tea** is quite similar with its vanilla cake and slightly fizzy aspect, but with honey instead of Pixie's yeasty mead, and with elderflower instead of apple blossom. The grapey elderberry also reminds me of **Achievement Unlocked** \[A bold blend of Mahogany and Merlot with tart elderberry and a single long-stemmed rose\].

**Bees Love Blue** \[Forget-me-not blossoms, imperial iris, blue lotus, delphinium, dwarf lilac, and hidcote lavender on a cloud of whipped white honey\] - This one is delicately floral and very much light purplish-blue in its scent color. Of the many flowers present here, I particularly get the iris (less musky here than in several other iris-centered perfumes I've tried) and the delicate, feminine forget-me-not (reminiscent of **Robin's Egg** \[Dainty forget-me-nots and lily of the valley, a dollop of whipped blueberry creme, and a cozy birch nest tucked into a flowering dogwood tree\]). **Bees Love Blue** has astonishing longevity; this is one of the NCD perfumes that will last all day on me. I adore this one, though you do have to like florals to enjoy it, because it's gorgeous florals and light airy honey and nothing else. If you liked the recent **Cyanophilia (Love of Blue)** \[Butterfly pea flower, periwinkle, tonka bean, vanilla orchid, and Himalayan poppy\] or last fall's **Twilight Spidersilk** \[Slender strands of cotton flower hung with trembling dewdrops, cobalt blue musk, vanilla orchid, imperial iris, white lilac, and a whisper of lavender\], you'll love this one; it's a similar gentle blue floral.

**Bees on the Bayou** \[Vines heavy with honeysuckle entwined with Easter lily, linden blossom, and neroli over a sweet foundation of pipe tobacco, pralines, and creamed honey\] - The pralines and tobacco together make me smell a sort of milk chocolate note, but that's secondary to the truly lovely white florals, the velvety kind rather than the brash in-your-face sort. NCD's honeysuckle often doesn't work for me, but here combined with the plush lily and slightly greenish, airy linden blossom the florals are altogether gorgeous. Husband agrees, saying that he truly enjoys smelling that waft of flower petals from my wrist, but on closer inspection he says he gets a sort of artificial blueberry note (??? yet again, what's up with his nose?). We both seem to agree, though, that this one is gorgeous florals accented by the gourmand notes.

**Busy Bee** \[A blend of Oolong and Tibetan black tea with peach blossom honey, cardamom, and clove, sharpened with pink peppercorn and dry oakwood\] - Tea, honey, and warm spices. Unlike the other Bees, many of which tend to be spring and summer perfumes for me, I wear this one exclusively in fall. It is such a *fantastic* autumn perfume for days when you don't want apple or pumpkin or overwhelming chai spices. Sadly discontinued! I made sure to get a backup before it disappeared.

**Dancing Bee** \[Peach trees barely budding, dewy white violet, honeysuckle, angelica and orris roots, frankincense, allspice, and spring harvest honey\] - Skin chem strikes again: I really can't wear NCD's honeysuckle; I just seem to amp honeysuckle to the exclusion of all other notes. At least here the frankincense is giving it a bit of a run for its money, so I do get a slightly cola-ish incense behind that candley honeysuckle. Where's my peach tree, violet, angelica, and orris root? Boo. If NCD's honeysuckle note works for you - and it seems like I'm quite unusual in it not working for me - do give **Dancing Bee** a try. I have seen reviews praising the delicacy of its floral notes and I'm just so jealous.

**Emotional Support Bee** \[Ivory-blush rose petals, orange blossom honey, apple blossoms, melissa leaf, silken shea, sacred benzoin, and just a hint of calming clary sage\] - This was one that I picked up on the strength of many IMAM rave reviews - I couldn't resist the chance to try it myself! I get primarily rose, honey, and clary sage, with orange blossom and shea butter there if I look for them. This is a very pretty and calming scent. It is recognizably similar to **Somniphilia** \[Lamb's wool accord, orange blossom, barely-budding lavender, melissa, green fig, clary, cloud musk, and weightless vanilla marshmallow meringue\] but without the sugary and airy vanilla that makes **Somniphilia** candy-like; the honey here in **Emotional Support Bee** is more a syrupy, golden richness rather than sweetness. When dry, it has a certain brown-sugary, **Little Brown Rabbit**\-esque note, and Husband especially likes it at this stage.

**Hive in the Wild** \[Budding maple trees beside a swift stream, snowdrops nodding over vernal pools, and dewy dogwoods offer a trove of nectar to fill a fledgeling hive\] - Why was I so excited to try this one, even though I'm not really one for woody perfumes? The *snowdrops*. All the cottagecore folks on Instagram always post photos of snowdrops starting in mid-February in celebration of the coming of spring. I was a little skittish because the notes description is mostly woods, but then it turns out to be mostly maple *syrup*, not maple *trees*, with a snowdrop that is more green and fresh than flowery.

**Honey, I'm Home** \[Snowdrops and fresh nectar from their first petals unfurled, golden sunlight, yellow crocus, and warmed honeycomb\] - This one is GORGEOUS, one of my top two favorites from the 2023 Bees. It's the light-golden warmth of an early spring day. After an initial burst of warm but airy honey, the honey blends in with the flowers, which really are yellow in their scent color. There's nothing grassy about these florals but they remind me of chamomile nonetheless - chamomile and daisies perhaps, they're just so cheerful and happy. This is the springtime sibling to **Yellow Leaves** \[Blooming moringa, olivewood, coriander, oakmoss, tangerine, and helichrysum\], the most perfect autumnal floral. After its initial burst of honey, this scent dries down to cling quite closely to my skin, a private little bubble of buoyancy and optimism. If you like **Fey Touched** \[Sunflower petals, honeyed almond, yuzu, sacred benzoin, and prismatic mist from woodland stream dappled in sunlight\] from the Geeks & Gamers collection, you should definitely try this one; it shares the same warm, glowing, carefree vibe.

**Honey Trap** \[Yellow snapdragon, white rose, early spring honey, candied lemon peel, clove bud, and Venus flytrap accord\] - It smells so delicate in the vial, but on my skin **Honey Trap** packs a wallop! This honey is sweet and deep and strong, and the white and green florals are *intense*. I really only get the bouquet and the honey until the very deep drydown, when the honey and florals recede enough to make space for a hint of clove.

**Honeymoon Suite** \[Santorini olivewood, Caribbean teak, St. Simons peach groves, and 1000 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets with traces of tuberose, sea glass, and wild honey\] - I love love love this one! It's been discontinued, just *tragic*. It goes on strong but immediately dries down to a soft and lovely perfume without much throw: a gentle peach paired with a light-colored and ever-so-slightly floral honey, with the teak, cotton, and aquatic ""sea glass"" notes combining to make this a ""spa-like"" scent--but an unusually delicate and pretty one. I've been rationing my sample ever since, and recently found a backup sample in someone's destash. This is a favorite summer perfume for me.

**It's Hive Code** \[Spring harvest honey, a faithful accord of rare Ghost Orchid, neroli and bergamot hand lotion, and a dark base of melted fudge\] - I got this sample because most of these notes sounded absolutely heavenly. Honey, orchid, neroli, and bergamot? Count me in - that sounds amazingly light and springy. I kept my fingers crossed that the fudge would be minimal. And...it's not. In the vial, this scent has a base of honey and chocolate fudge, with the light citrus and floral above, and on my skin, it continues to be a fight between the gorgeous, breezy springtime floral and the heavier, waxy (almost tootsie roll-ish) chocolate. And it's so strange, because up close, the chocolate is so much less obvious that it really almost is the scent I wanted it to be. Personally, I just really wish it didn't have the fudge - I think all of the other notes are just perfect! All in all, **It's Hive Code** is much more atmospheric than springtime. Like the the several NCD blends that pair caramel with wildly different notes (**Mad Scientist**, **Glass Pumpkin**, **Venus Verticordia**), this one is a thoroughly unexpected combination. My experience is also slightly hampered by the fact that I haven't seen the Netflix show (Wednesday) that it's an homage to.

**Like Bees to Honey** \[Four fabulous vanillas swirled with Tupelo honey, mangosteen, saffron, pink grapefruit, Egyptian musk, ivory amber, cardamom, Grains of Paradise, and Queen Elizabeth root\] - This one features the sweetness of vanilla and honey, cut with a hint of bitter citrus peel and almost rose-like spices. From a distance, it's a complex brown sugar. It's definitely in the same family as my beloved **Little Brown Rabbit** \[Nutmeg and tonka bean nuzzle up against fluffy marshmallow, cottonflower, pink pepper, and a trace of carrot seed\], and while I wouldn't necessarily call **Like Bees to Honey** ""snuggly,"" it is an extremely ""warm"" perfume.

**Napping in a Flower** \[Tender ripe apricot, Bulgarian lavender, spiced summer honey, plum blossom, daylily, honeysuckle, and ylang\] - First off, how cute is the name? Unfortunately, that apricot note just won't work on me, and on my skin this perfume smells like a fall candle and spiced nuts. Meanwhile, Husband smells florals when he sniffs my wrist, specifically lilac. Dry, the honey note becomes individually discernable, and it is rich and golden. I wanted this one to work on me so badly but even after a year of aging it wouldn't, so I destashed it.

**None of Your Beeswax** \[Thorny brambles of blackberry, elderflower, violet, fennel seed, sacred benzoin, and unfiltered honey\] - This one is bit fruity in a purplish sense, a bit woody, and a bit floral. It's well-blended and none of the individual elements stands out too much. It reminds me of **Blue Jay** \[Sturdy blue spruce and young oak support the bold elegance of white peony, angelica, blackberry bramble, and rhubarb\], another woody-fruity-floral perfume that also features blackberry bramble specifically, but perhaps in a more unassuming way - **None of Your Beeswax** is the shyer springtime cousin of the more summery **Blue Jay**.

**Parisian Apiary** \[Cherry blossom, silver linden, white pear, and cafe au lait sweetened with French honey\] - I was wary of the coffee note in this one and almost passed it up, but after having enjoyed the milky coffee note in a few Poesie scents, such as **Thirteen Hours** \[Dried leaves, bare branches, hazelnut shortbread, coffee, cashmere vanilla, cinnamon bark\] and **Solar Witch** \[Coffee, crisp autumn air, apple cider donuts, sunflowers, warm sandalwood, a faint whisper of hearth fire\], as much as I did, I was willing to give this a try, especially since all the other notes sounded so good, and I just love the inspiration of Parisian rooftop beehives! And *wow*, this is *spectacular*. Sure, I can describe each note in turn - the cherry blossom is cheerful and pink, almost peony but a little creamier; the honey is pitch-perfect for this scent, neither too light nor too cloying; the pear is a subtle glimmer of fruity sweetness; all over a warm milky coffee that functions more like a tonka-style base than an accent note - but really, this scent is so much more than the sum of its individual parts. There's a playfulness to its elegance, the coffee plus floral with just that hint of fruit and that honeyed sweetness. It's honestly one of the most evocative and lovely atmospherics I've encountered. I wore it *constantly* last spring and of course ended up FSing it.

**Queen Bee** \[Creamy white gardenia and fluffy whipped honey\] - This one is stunning in its simplicity: the gardenia is fragrant and almost spicy (and very different than many other gardenia notes I've tried, which have tended to be quite musky and occasionally indolic), and the honey is sharp and sweet. There's also a little bit of a spearmint undertone, which I still don't understand but which makes this really unique. I wear this *constantly* every spring.

**She Stopped to Pet a Bumblebee** \[Cocoa butter and shea, cotton flower, silk tree, apple blossom, wildflower honey, bee balm, and heliotrope\] - Another adorable name! When I first apply it, I get quasi-Yankee candle vibes like **Napping in a Flower** and **Bees' Cotillion**, which is odd because it doesn't share any notes with them. As it dries though, any candle association goes away and it becomes the most lovely, intimate, and expensive lotion, soft and skin-musky. This is definitely a ""my skin but better"" perfume.

**Wasp** \[Fresh linen, crisp chardonnay, and a rain-quenched herb garden edged with impeccable boxwood topiaries\] - Another stunner, evoking the feeling of a summer garden without any earthy or vegetal notes (which I personally really appreciate, since soil notes are not my thing). The chardonnay is most prominent, and it's more elderflower than aldehyde, with a crisp, clean linen note blowing behind it, and herbs that are more mossy than sharp. Funny how this Bee doesn't contain any honey! But it doesn't need it; it's *perfect* just as it is. Another one that has been tragically discontinued.

**Witches' Apiary** \[Peru balsam, almond shells, mahogany, olive wood, and dark, viscous honey conjured from the blossoms of blackberry brambles\] - This one is woody and resinous, with a strong and unexpected predominance of coconut husk (not in the notes, but that's definitely what it smells like on me). I only get the woody, dry husk part, though Husband smells coconut flesh as well. This scent reminds me of **Aphrodite Chrysea** \[Sacred benzoin, amber and copal resins, Moroccan cashmere, pink sandalwood, osmanthus, guava, and coconut milk chai\] and it would be a great summertime scent for folks who like dry woodsy scents. (This does not describe me or my perfume tastes. So I destashed it.)

**Wretched Hive of Scum & Villainy** \[Portrait of an extraterrestrial desert and its elusive denizens: dry white sandalwood, Tunisian tea, cracked coriander, cassia bark, amber resin, raw cotton, and combs full of precious honey that few will ever taste\] - Friends, Nui Cobalt has done it again: another *spectacular* black tea scent! This one is black tea spiced with coriander and cinnamon, gently sweetened with honey, and with some very subtle nuances of cotton flower and sandalwood (making it a much more rainy-day-cozy scent than the perfume's name might suggest). This tea note is more incensey than **Blarney: Irish Breakfast Tea** \[The warm, tannic comfort of a proper Cuppa sweetened with a touch of raw honey and smoothed with fresh cream\], more like the black tea in **Unbought & Unbossed: A Tribute to Shirley Chisholm** \[The fragrance inspired by her is a strong and sophisticated spiced tea with raw honey and Barbados sugar sipped among the sunlit roses of the Brooklyn Botanical Garden\] and **Cloak of Evergreens** \[Snow-covered spruce, iced cedar tips, golden pine sap, icicle musk, and the fading memory of tea by the fireside\]. I'm a big fan.

# Nui's Favorite Things

**All Dolled Up** \[Spiced apricot preserves, almond blossom, pink peony, Hawaiian and Australian sandalwoods, balsam of Peru, and sunlit amber\] - Despite the notes list starting off with apricot and almond, **All Dolled Up** does NOT read like a Squirrel (which all start with the same base: ""A playful blend of almond and spiced apricot, grounded in rich benzoin and copaiba balsam""). Instead, it reminds me strongly of **Rose Gold Sky** \[Fuzzy apricot, amber resin, styrax, pink sandalwood, clove bud, melissa, and blush rose\], but lighter and more warm-weather. When I first tried this, I didn't have the notes list in front of me (and I didn't remember it), so my impression that this scent is pink amber + apricot + clove (see the connection to **Rose Gold Sky**?) was completely independent of the actual official notes. Then seeing the notes list a little later in the day, I could also easily make out the peony (a very ""pink"" floral), which is a big part of why this reads as more summery than **Rose Gold Sky**.

**Art Deco** \[Black lilac, sandalwood, cassis, and liatrix, with a subtle glimmer of lemon verbena\] - So I know the floral here is supposed to be ""black lilac,"" but I'm really truly getting more a night-blooming jasmine, which is quite thrilling because it has a dark, brooding, and robust quality without hitting me over the face with it or going at all indolic (as Nui Cobalt's jasmine notes often do). I've learned to be cautious with NCD's jasmine, but this one here hits all the best parts for me with none of the aspects I don't love. This pairing with the plummy dark berry note of cassis reminds me of **Disco** \[Champagne, juicy purple plum, black styrax, creamy non-indolic jasmine, ylang ylang, and a twist of mandarin\] and **Victorian Burlesque** \[Indigo musk, sparkling plum wine, night blooming jasmine, blackcurrant jam, green cardamom and cinnamon crème brûlée\]! The sandalwood base is kind of nondescript, as NCD's sandalwood usually is - I'm spoiled by NAVA's fine sandalwoods - and for anyone worried about the lemon verbena, I don't get any lemon at all though I suspect it's functioning well to add just a touch of acidity for brightness and sparkle.

**Blanket Fort** \[Cotton flower, grey suede, warm amber, green fig, tumbled teakwood, and raw vanilla bean\] - This scent is a suede blanket, soft and heavy, a comforting weight draped over your legs, and maybe you're nuzzling your nose against a corner because it's so silky. I honestly don't get any other distinct notes besides ""suede blanket,"" and the NCD cotton flower note is definitely more on the ""fabric"" than ""soapy"" side. And it is an unmistakably *grey* scent. Honestly, **Blanket Fort** reminds me of nothing so much as a stuffed-animal seal, with the thick warm rubberiness of a sealskin transformed into soft cuddly fabric.

**Candlelight** \[Molten vanilla caramel, Egyptian musk, mahogany, honey amber, black tea, cathedral incense, a pinch of galangal, and a glimmer of white grapefruit\] - Caramel and honey, thick and rich and luscious, backed by golden amber, a touch of grapefruit to cut the molten sweetness, and a whole lot of very expensive-smelling Egyptian musk. There are some indistinct spices too, which is perhaps how my nose is reading the black tea and incense. (This is a bummer, because I LOVE Nui Cobalt's black tea + incense combo, but this scent doesn't really feature them.) It's a heavy, luxurious scent, a sister to **Ailurophilia (Love of Cats)** \[Egyptian musk, tonka, and dulce de leche wrapped in luxuriant cashmere, soft suede, wisps of sandalwood and copal smoke\]. Its dark, honeyed quality is also reminiscent of **Arcana Snug** \[The scent of staying in to watch the snow fall: dark honey amber, marshmallow, and the glow of beeswax candles\], but with caramel instead of beeswax. This one has tremendous throw, much stronger than most Nui Cobalts, and (based on a conversation with a colleague who smelled ""pancakes"" from across the room when I wore it) to an untrained nose, apparently smells extremely (and solely) like maple syrup! To me, though, it's not nearly as similar to the mapley **Little Brown Rabbit** as it is to the caramel of **Ailurophilia**.

**Fairy Garden** \[Cool dewdrops cupped in clover leaves, early purple orchid, a porcelain thimble of green tea with oat milk, and frosted almond cakes served in an acorn cap\] - It goes on more gourmand than I was expecting, primarily oat milk, green tea, and sugary frosting. Behind these are a bit of acorn earthiness (I recognize a similar acorn note to **Deep Midnight Wildwood** \[Pumpkin Bread, Incense, Acorns, Dried Apple and Orange Peels, Fading Bonfire\], the only other place I've experienced an acorn accord) and a touch of floral. At first (and to my surprise, based on the order of the notes list), I don't get any aquatic dewdrop nor any grassy clover but as the scent dries, these start to emerge as the sweetness of the frosting recedes. Eventually, all these notes combine to create a very detailed scent portrait not just of a fairy garden, but of the fairies holding a fancy tea party among the flowers. It's sort of in the same family as **Poesie Green Girl** \[Pistachio, wildflower honey, oatmilk matcha latte, heliotrope blossoms, marshmallow musk\], and has a similar Poesie-style whimsicality.

**A Galaxy of Fireflies** \[Delicate sweet pea, garden basil, honeydew, unripe citrus, bioluminescent musk, absinthe, and ambrette seed\] - So fresh and fun! It's an undeniably green scent, all honeydew melon and herbs, but with a lightness and buoyancy that makes it incredibly uplifting and refreshing. It reminds me a lot of **Wasp**, but less cotton-clean and more juicy-fruity. A wee bit of delicate sweet pea floral comes out in the drydown too, and at this point I *especially* love it. Another fantastic green summer scent!

**Nostalgia** \[The softly tousled hair of a favorite doll, creased diary pages, moon-lit water lilies, and tiny drops of honeysuckle nectar\] - How interesting! In the vial, it's a green, aquatic floral with hints of papyrus, but on my skin it becomes something else entirely. It becomes all pink, creamy cherry blossoms with strawberry cream savers, and - though it might just be the power of suggestion; this is reminding me a lot of Poesie's own take on **Nostalgia** \[Iconic blend of tangy kiwi and sweet strawberry, baby doll heads, pink amber, vanilla bean\] - also some green kiwi. Unfortunately, I'm also getting a TON of plastic baby doll, and while it is indeed quite nostalgic, I'm really not one for ""plastic doll musk,"" so this one isn't for me.

**Parisian Pink** \[Peony petals, a suede settee, osmanthus, silk tree, spun sugar, Margaret Merril roses, pink grapefruit, and antique sandalwood\] - Without looking at the notes, several of my first impressions were spot-on...and for some reason (maybe the combination of peony + grapefruit?) I also get strawberries! On my skin when first applied, this perfume is strawberry, suede, silk, and an overwhelming aura of PINK! It's gorgeous and makes me feel like a pretty pretty princess. As it dries, the distinctly strawberry note subsides, and it becomes a little more nonspecifically floral and sweet, still with those lovely NCD fabric notes of suede and silk. I have worn this several times to the ballet, actually - it's perfect for the occasion. If you like **Switch** \[Champagne, Lady's Slipper orchid, Egyptian cotton, kudzu, pomegranate, and pink larkspur\], which to me is very ""pink strawberry soda"" (full review post coming soon!), you should definitely try **Parisian Pink**. I often wear this one to the ballet.

# Personally...

My favorites of the florals are **Queen Bee** and **Bees Love Blue**, both *so* lovely.

My favorite distinctly seasonal scents in this collection are **Parisian Apiary** and **Honey, I'm Home** for spring, **The Bees' High Tea** for spring leading into summer, **Honeymoon Suite** and **Wasp** for high summer, and **Busy Bee** for fall.

I knew I'd love **Bee Not Afraid**, and it is exactly as amazing as we all thought it would be when its name and notes description was announced last year.

**Bee Kind To Yourself** is one of NCD's truly iconic scents, and not to be missed - especially because it was inspired by a member of this community!

**Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy** stands alongside **Cheat Code** and **Blarney: Irish Breakfast Tea** as one of my favorite all-purpose NCD tea scents.

And if you're looking for gentle, delicate, my-skin-but-better scents, try **Emotional Support Bee** and **She Stopped to Pet a Bumblebee**.
